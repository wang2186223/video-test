###Chapter 1

"You can quit your job after we're married. Just stay home, take care of me, and give me a healthy son within a year. No daughters—they're too expensive to raise!"

The words dripped with arrogance.

The man who spoke them sat across from Evelyn Whitmore, her blind date for the evening. Nearly forty, balding, with a gut that strained against his cheap suit.

Her stepmother, Victoria Blackwood, had arranged this disaster, terrified Evelyn might actually marry someone respectable.

The man had wrinkled his nose at Evelyn’s heavy eyeliner and dark lipstick, but his gaze lingered on her slender frame. She could practically see the lewd thoughts forming behind his beady eyes.

"How tall are you?" he demanded.

Evelyn swirled her coffee absently. "One sixty-eight."

His grin widened. "Perfect. I’m almost one-eighty—ideal height difference. You’ll have to stand on your toes to kiss me, but don’t worry. I’ll bend you over just fine."

Men who claimed to be "almost one-eighty" were lucky if they hit one seventy-two.

Evelyn rolled her heavily shadowed eyes. "If a woman has to tiptoe to kiss you, you’re not as tall as you think."

His face darkened. "What’s that supposed to mean?"

Just then, the café door swung open. A man strode in—tall, broad-shouldered, with an air of quiet authority.

Evelyn’s gaze locked onto him. A reckless idea sparked.

She stood, sauntered over, and flashed him a grin. "Hey, handsome. Mind helping me prove a point?"

Before he could react, she grabbed his tie, yanked him down, and pressed her lips to his.

She pulled back, smirking at her stunned blind date. "See? This is the height difference that requires tiptoes."

The man turned purple. "You—you shameless little—!" He jabbed a finger at her. "I’ll make sure everyone knows what a slut you are! Good luck finding anyone willing to marry you after this!"

Perfect. If word got out, Victoria would have a hell of a time forcing her into another setup.

Evelyn scoffed, kicked his chair for good measure, then tossed a careless wave at the stranger. "Thanks for the assist. See you never."

She turned to leave—but an icy grip clamped around her wrist.

"You kiss me without permission," a deep voice rumbled, "and think you can just walk away?"

A shiver raced down her spine. She looked up—and froze.

The man was devastating. Sharp cheekbones, piercing dark eyes, a mouth that promised both sin and punishment.

Oh no.

In her hurry to humiliate her date, she’d picked the most dangerous man in the room.

Evelyn lifted her chin. "What do you want?"

Before he could answer, his assistant—Lucas Sinclair—stepped forward, phone in hand. "Sir, bad news. Isabella’s flight was diverted. She won’t make it tonight."

The man’s jaw tightened.

Evelyn tugged at her trapped wrist. "Let. Go."

Instead, his grip tightened. A slow, chilling smile curved his lips. "Fate just delivered me a replacement."

Lucas blanched. "Sir, you can’t possibly mean—"

"I do." Nathaniel Grayson’s gaze never left Evelyn’s. "She’ll do."

Evelyn’s stomach dropped. "Do what?"

His thumb brushed her pulse point. "Take responsibility for that kiss."

She laughed, incredulous. "You’re joking. I lost my first kiss today, and you want me to pay for it?"

"First kiss?" His brow arched.

"Twenty years of pristine restraint," she shot back, "wasted on you."

Nathaniel’s expression darkened. "Take her."

Before she could protest, two men in black suits ushered her into a waiting car.

Twenty minutes later, Evelyn stood in the grand ballroom of Silver Moon Estate, heart pounding.

Whispers rippled through the crowd.

"Is that Nathaniel’s fiancée?"

"She looks... unconventional."

The host beamed. "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Nathaniel Grayson’s engagement ceremony!"

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

She’d expected a slap, maybe an arrest.

Not this.
###Chapter 2

The crowd below the stage erupted in murmurs.

Whispers slithered through the air like snakes.

"That's Nathaniel Grayson's fiancée? She looks like she crawled out of a gutter!"

"Shouldn't someone like him be with a refined lady? Who even is that girl?"

"Well... Nathaniel always did have... unique tastes."

Evelyn Whitmore had dressed like a street urchin on purpose—to scare off her blind date. But Nathaniel didn’t seem fazed.

Not by the whispers.

Not by the judgmental stares.

He stood there, detached, as if this entire farce amused him.

She gritted her teeth.

Trapped.

No choice but to play along.

The engagement ring slid onto her finger, cold and heavy.

The applause that followed was hollow. Polite. For Nathaniel’s sake, not hers.

As soon as the ceremony ended, she bolted.

Three women blocked her path.

"Who are you?"

"What kind of trashy outfit is that?"

"You think you’re worthy of Nathaniel Grayson?"

Evelyn’s patience snapped.

She grabbed two by their perfectly styled hair—

—and cracked their skulls together.

Thud.

They crumpled.

The third woman stumbled back, eyes wide.

Evelyn flicked her wrist. "Move."

She moved.

Across the room, Dominic Prescott choked on his champagne.

"Where the hell did you find her, Nathaniel?"

Nathaniel swirled his wine, lips curving. "Her lips taste like honey."

Dominic gaped.

A crash interrupted them.

Wine splattered across Evelyn’s already ruined outfit.

"Your fiancée’s in trouble," Dominic mused.

Nathaniel didn’t even glance over. "She’ll handle it."

And she did.

Brutally.

Dominic whistled. "Now I get it."

Nathaniel’s gaze darkened.

She was strong.

Clever.

Unbreakable.

Perfect.

Lucas Sinclair approached. "Sir, should I take her to change?"

Nathaniel nodded.

Evelyn stormed over instead.

"One kiss, and you trap me in this circus? You’re insane."

Nathaniel smirked. "How much do you think my kiss is worth?"

She studied him.

His sharp jaw.

Those sinful lips.

"Thirty bucks. Max."

Lucas gasped.

Nathaniel’s fingers caught her chin.

Danger hummed in his touch.

"Bold words, little rabbit. But you don’t run from me."

She scoffed. "Bathroom. Now."

He let her go.

Five minutes later, Lucas returned, grim. "She jumped out the window."

Nathaniel laughed.

Of course she did.

"Find her. Send the betrothal gifts."

Dominic shook his head. "You’re really marrying her?"

Nathaniel’s smile was razor-sharp. "She’s exactly what I need."

Evelyn slipped into her house late that night.

Gregory’s hand swung toward her face.

She dodged.

"You disgrace!" he roared.

Victoria Blackwood sniffled, playing the martyr. "It’s my fault she’s so wild..."

Evelyn rolled her eyes.

She tossed a folder onto the table.

"Here. All the wonderful men Victoria picked for me. Pick one. I’ll marry him."

Gregory flipped through it.

His face turned to stone.

Victoria paled.

Evelyn smirked.

Game on.
###Chapter 3

The documents Evelyn handed Gregory exposed every single man as worthless.

Most were pushing forty. Half didn’t even have stable careers.

Gregory shot Victoria a glare. “Some of these men are my age. How could you set Evelyn up with someone that old?”

Victoria stiffened. She’d paid to alter their photos and profiles. The quiet Evelyn uncovering the truth? Unthinkable.

Instantly, Victoria played victim. “I don’t understand, Gregory! I handpicked elite bachelors for Evelyn! The matchmaker must’ve lied!”

Evelyn smirked. “Elite? You didn’t even verify their backgrounds. Marriage is life-changing, yet you treat mine like a joke. Would you let Cassandra marry a man twice her age?”

Victoria scrambled. “It’s not like that—”

Gregory slammed the papers against her chest. “Enough. You’re banned from handling Evelyn’s marriage plans. And your credit cards are frozen this month. Stay home and reflect.”

Victoria paled. “Gregory, this is a mistake—”

Ignoring her, Gregory turned to Evelyn. “I’m sorry you endured those awful dates. No more blind meetings.”

Evelyn smiled. “Thanks, Dad.”

The moment Gregory left, Victoria’s face twisted with rage.

Evelyn met her glare calmly. “Oh, Aunt Victoria? I gave those ‘elite’ men Cassandra’s number instead of mine. Maybe she’ll marry one.”

Victoria’s jaw dropped. “You did WHAT?”

Her precious Cassandra—a rising star—was leagues above those losers. They weren’t fit to breathe the same air as her!

Evelyn yawned and headed upstairs, done with the conversation.

Victoria muttered curses, then hurried after Gregory—until the doorbell rang.

Who visited this late?

Opening the door, she froze. A sharp-dressed man stood there, flanked by a team in black, all carrying lavish gifts.

Victoria tensed. “Who are you?”

The man—Lucas—smiled. “Good evening. My employer sent betrothal gifts for your daughter.”

“Betrothal gifts? From who?”

“Nathaniel Grayson.”

Victoria’s heart stopped. “The Nathaniel Grayson? Of the Grayson dynasty?”

“Correct.”

Her mind raced. “So… Nathaniel has taken an interest in my daughter?”

Lucas hesitated. “You could say that.”

Cassandra! Of course—her beauty and fame had caught Nathaniel’s eye. But betrothal gifts? Without warning?

Lucas frowned at her silence. “Do you object?”

“No! It’s just… my daughter isn’t home. Shouldn’t we discuss this when—”

“Ma’am,” Lucas cut in, “your daughter already accepted Nathaniel’s ring. These gifts are merely a formality.”

Victoria’s pulse spiked. Cassandra had kept this from her?

She ushered Lucas inside, but he declined. “Nathaniel will visit in three days to finalize the marriage.”

“Three days? That’s—”

“Don’t worry. Everything’s arranged. Only the finest for your daughter.”

Victoria nearly fainted. The Graysons’ wealth and power—hers by association!

Gregory emerged, gaping at the gifts. “What’s all this?”

Victoria clutched a diamond necklace. “Nathaniel Grayson wants Cassandra! These are betrothal gifts!”

Gregory staggered. “The CEO of Grayson Group? He’s marrying our Cassandra?”

Victoria nodded wildly. “Yes! Our daughter’s securing our future!”

Gregory clutched his chest. “This is incredible!”

Victoria preened. “You’re welcome.”

Gregory hugged her. “Thank you for raising such an exceptional daughter.”

She smirked. “So my credit cards…?”

“Forgotten! Though, Evelyn’s dates—that was unacceptable.”

Victoria sighed. “I only matched her with older men because she’s so unruly! The matchmaker deceived me!”

Gregory relented. “Fine. Just don’t let it happen again.”

Victory. Evelyn was no match for her.

Once Cassandra married Nathaniel, Evelyn would be irrelevant.

The next morning, Victoria summoned Cassandra home.

Cassandra stormed in. “Mom, I’m filming today! What’s so urgent?”

“Your engagement to Nathaniel Grayson!”

Cassandra blinked. “What engagement? I’ve never even met him!”

Victoria’s smile faltered. “Then why did his men deliver betrothal gifts last night? They said you accepted his ring!”
###Chapter 4 

Cassandra froze when she heard her mother's words.

"A ring? When did I—"

She suddenly remembered. "Oh! Yesterday, an anonymous fan mailed me a diamond ring! I was afraid the paparazzi would twist it into some scandal, so I kept it hidden instead of wearing it."

Victoria's face lit up with excitement. "That must be it! Mister Nathaniel has been secretly admiring you for ages! He sent that ring pretending to be a fan to win your heart! I had someone investigate the visitors from yesterday—their leader was none other than Nathaniel Grayson's personal assistant!"

"Cassandra, the Graysons are a top-tier family! Nathaniel is clearly head over heels for you! Marrying him would secure your future!"

Nathaniel Grayson...

Cassandra's cheeks flushed, her pulse quickening. She'd heard of him—the golden heir of the prestigious Grayson family, a titan in the business world. To think someone like him was her devoted fan, so infatuated that he'd sent betrothal gifts to her doorstep! It only proved how irresistible she was.

That afternoon, Evelyn returned home cradling a delicate photo frame. She slipped into her house shoes and headed straight upstairs.

Cassandra intercepted her on purpose. "What's that? Did you steal something from my betrothal gifts?"

Evelyn stopped cold. "It's mine."

"Prove it. Show me!" Cassandra had always despised her country-bred half-sister, seeing her as a stain on the Whitmore name. She snatched the frame from Evelyn's arms.

"Ugh. The way you were clutching it, I thought it was jewelry. Just some picture of your homewrecker mother!"

"My mother wasn't a homewrecker!"

Evelyn lunged for it, but Cassandra deliberately let it fall. "Oops! My bad!"

Evelyn's eyes burned as Cassandra stepped on the fallen frame.

It was an old photo of her mother, painstakingly restored and framed earlier that day. She'd planned to display it in her room.

Furious, Evelyn grabbed Cassandra's collar. "Pick. It. Up."

Cassandra scoffed. "How dare you lay hands on me? I'm about to become a Grayson! Cross me, and they'll ruin you!"

Evelyn stiffened. The Graysons? Her scalp prickled—the man who'd forced an engagement on her yesterday shared that surname.

"You mean that elite family?"

Cassandra smirked. "Obviously! Scared? You should be! Nathaniel is obsessed with me. Those gifts? All from the Graysons. Touch anything, and you'll never afford the damages!"

Evelyn glanced at the lavish betrothal gifts, then froze.

Nathaniel must have lost his mind.

Her lips curled. "Congratulations, then. But are you sure a family like the Graysons would accept a scandal-ridden actress?"

Cassandra's face darkened. "Nathaniel loves me. He'll protect me!"

"Really?" Evelyn smirked, picking up the photo and dusting it off before walking away.

She'd been searching for a way out of yesterday's mess—now, Cassandra had handed her the perfect solution.

Cassandra sneered, but unease twisted inside her. Evelyn's words struck a nerve. The Graysons were untouchable, while her acting career was barely respectable. If they learned of her scandals...

Decision made, she pulled out her phone to quit the industry.

Before she could dial, it rang—another spam call. She almost ignored it until she recognized the caller: a recent "benefactor."

"Miss me, babe? Come to the hotel tonight!"

Disgusted, she snapped, "Don't call me that. It's revolting."

"What? After begging me for that Lotus Award role?"

"I've quit acting. Find someone else. Never call me again!"

On the other end, the greasy old man seethed. He'd bought her that diamond ring, and this was her thanks?

Ungrateful witch. Your career is over.

Three days later, the Whitmores hosted a grand wedding banquet.

Victoria had insisted on extravagance to showcase her daughter's glorious match.

"Look! The Grayson procession is here! Only a top-tier family could afford these limited-edition cars!"

"That first one costs ten Bugattis!"

"I'm so jealous! Nathaniel Grayson is a dream groom!"

Cassandra preened in her wedding gown, basking in the envy.

Evelyn was conspicuously absent—probably sulking somewhere.

Let her rot in jealousy.

Cassandra eagerly anticipated meeting Nathaniel. He'd be devastatingly handsome, kneeling before her with a passionate declaration under everyone's awe...

The procession halted at the Whitmore villa gates.

Nathaniel stepped out of the lead car—tall, commanding, effortlessly elegant.

Lucas signaled the groomsmen to follow as they approached the villa's entrance, adorned with "Congratulations Newlyweds!"

Suddenly, Nathaniel stopped. His gaze lifted to the villa's attic balcony, where a pajama-clad woman leaned against the railing, watching.

Their eyes met.

She immediately turned and vanished.

Evelyn's breath hitched. He saw me.

But without yesterday's heavy makeup, maybe he wouldn't recognize her.

Still, she needed to leave—now.

Below, Lucas frowned at Nathaniel's abrupt halt. "Sir, the ceremony is about to start."
###Chapter 5

Nathaniel tilted his head slightly, his sharp gaze narrowing on the small balcony connected to the empty attic. After a brief pause, he murmured a command, "Bring the men inside for now."

Lucas blinked in surprise but didn't dare question his boss. With a quick wave of his hand, he signaled the waiting entourage.

"Everyone, follow me."

The Grayson wedding procession had been stalled at the front gate of the Whitmore villa, where bridesmaids playfully demanded gifts, creating a boisterous scene.

No one noticed the groom slipping away to the back of the estate.

There, a girl strolled casually, humming the Wedding March as if she were invisible.

She barely took three steps before a strong hand seized the back of her neck, lifting her clean off the ground. Her legs dangled helplessly, like a rabbit caught in a snare.

"Did you really think you could escape?" His voice was deep, smooth as aged whiskey, yet edged with ice.

Evelyn didn’t need to see his face to know—it was Nathaniel.

She hadn’t expected him to recognize her from that brief glimpse earlier. Still, she had prepared for this.

Twisting her head to face him, she deliberately lisped, "M-M-Mister? Who are you? Why are you grabbing me?"

Nathaniel recoiled slightly when he saw her face, releasing her as if burned.

The woman before him was a grotesque sight—thick unibrow, swollen lips smeared with garish lipstick, and a face dotted with fake moles. Her eyeshadow looked like a rainbow explosion.

Evelyn smirked inwardly at his horrified expression.

Playing dumb, she stammered, "Mister, you're getting m-married, right? You're at the w-wrong place! The bride’s waiting at the f-f-front!"

Nathaniel’s lips curled into a cold smile. "Is that so? Then why are you wearing the Grayson family’s engagement ring?"

He snatched her hand, holding it up to reveal the diamond ring stubbornly clinging to her finger.

Evelyn cursed inwardly.

She had tried to remove it, but the damn thing wouldn’t budge, no matter how much soap she used.

Nathaniel’s dark eyes gleamed with amusement. "Don’t bother. The ring’s made of titanium alloy mixed with a proprietary blend. It won’t come off without a specific essential oil."

Evelyn gritted her teeth.

So that was his trick.

"Fine," she sighed. "Let’s be honest. You don’t actually want to marry me—you just need a wife in name for some reason. Am I wrong?"

Nathaniel didn’t answer, but his silence confirmed her guess.

Evelyn grinned. "Great! Then my sister Cassandra would love to marry you. She’s prettier, curvier—perfect for your needs!"

Nathaniel studied her, intrigued.

Most women threw themselves at him. Yet here she was, practically shoving him toward another woman.

Interesting.

His lips twitched. "I only marry the woman wearing my ring."

Evelyn scowled. "Easy fix. Get me that oil, I’ll take it off, and you can give it to Cassandra!"

"I don’t have any."

"Then buy some!"

"Discontinued. Can’t be bought."

Evelyn’s eye twitched.

With a sudden gasp, she pointed behind him. "Mister, look! A flying pig!"

Nathaniel didn’t even blink.

Pathetic attempt.

The next second, Evelyn found herself hoisted off the ground again, kicking uselessly as Nathaniel carried her away like an unruly kitten.

Back at the villa, Lucas had just ushered the groomsmen inside when his phone buzzed. Nathaniel’s name flashed on the screen.

Answering swiftly, he nodded before turning to the men. "Change of plans. We’re leaving."

Victoria, smug just moments ago, paled. "What? But the bride’s still inside!"

Lucas gave her a frosty look. "There’s been a misunderstanding. Mr. Grayson’s bride isn’t named Cassandra."

With that, he strode past her, the entourage following.

Victoria stood frozen, her face ashen.

Misunderstanding?

The guests erupted into whispers.

Gregory, who had been basking in praise earlier, now burned with humiliation. He rounded on Victoria. "What the hell is this? You swore Nathaniel was marrying Cassandra!"

Victoria stammered, "But—the Graysons delivered the betrothal gifts to us! You saw it!"

Gregory slapped her. "You’ve made us a laughingstock!"

Cassandra, still waiting in her wedding dress, stormed out. "Dad! Mom! Where’s Nathaniel? Where’s my groom?"

Victoria clutched her stinging cheek. "He—he left with the real bride."

Cassandra’s face drained of color. "What? That’s impossible! He was supposed to marry me!"

The relatives, long tired of their arrogance, sneered.

"Face it, Cassandra. A man like Nathaniel Grayson would never marry a scandal-ridden actress like you."

"Honestly, we all wondered how you landed him. Now we know—it was a mistake!"

Cassandra fled to her room, humiliation burning her cheeks.

One question tormented her: Who did Nathaniel take instead?

There couldn’t possibly be another Whitmore nearby… right?
###Chapter 6

The golden hues of sunset faded into twilight, draping the world in shadows.

The master bedroom at the Grayson estate was spacious, its king-sized bed dominating the center. After Evelyn was escorted inside, Nathaniel handed her off to the waiting maids with a curt command.

"Prepare her."

They descended upon her like a well-trained unit—washing her face, applying light makeup, then dressing her in an elegant white wedding gown. The delicate veil obscured her vision, leaving only blurred shapes in her periphery. When she glanced down, she caught sight of his polished leather shoes mere inches from her own.

His voice, deep and resonant, cut through the silence. "Play along, and I won't harm you."

Beneath the calm delivery lay an unspoken threat.

Evelyn clenched her jaw. There was no escaping this man—not when he'd tracked her down so effortlessly.

"Fine," she relented. "But I want a timeline. How long do you expect this charade to last? Once it's over, we go our separate ways."

Nathaniel had no interest in her beyond necessity. "Three months."

Just enough time for his grandfather to recover post-surgery.

"Deal." Three months was manageable. She reached for his hand without hesitation. "Let's go, Mr. Grayson. Time to make this official."

He stiffened slightly at her touch. Oddly, the contact didn't repulse him as it usually would with strangers. Her fingers were surprisingly soft.

The Graysons had orchestrated a lavish yet traditional ceremony. Evelyn walked beside Nathaniel through the banquet hall, the ceremony brief but suffocatingly formal. Afterward, she was ushered into a room dripping with newlywed ambiance.

When Nathaniel entered, he found her perched stiffly on the bed's edge, veil still in place—a picture-perfect blushing bride awaiting her groom.

A scoff escaped him. "Drop the act. We're alone now."

She didn't move.

Frowning, he strode forward and lifted the veil himself.

Beneath the warm lighting, her face was serene in sleep—long lashes brushing porcelain cheeks, lips slightly parted with a trail of drool at the corner. She even licked them absently.

Had she really fallen asleep sitting up?

The motion of the veil disturbed her balance. Her head lolled, body tipping sideways—

Nathaniel caught her instinctively before she hit the floor.

She frowned but didn't wake.

For the first time, he saw her bare-faced. No garish makeup, just delicate features that stirred something unexpected in his chest.

Then her eyes flew open.

The unfamiliar proximity jolted her awake. She shoved against his chest, scrambling back. "What the hell? Hands off! This marriage is fake!"

His jaw tightened. "I never said it wasn't."

"You promised three months!"

"I said it ends in three months." His smirk was razor-sharp. "I never said nothing would happen between now and then."

He caught her chin, calloused fingers exerting deliberate pressure.

Evelyn jerked her head away. "Men should keep their word!"

"Begging might improve my mood," he mused, leaning closer until their breaths mingled. Then, with a derisive snort, he released her. "Relax. You're not my type."

She exhaled sharply. "Good. Overbearing old men aren't mine either."

His eye twitched. Old?

Evelyn poked his chest. "Move. I need to shower."

He didn't budge, forcing her to sidestep him with a huff.

The bathroom lock clicked behind her.

Steam curled around Evelyn as she stepped from the shower, realization dawning—she'd forgotten clean clothes.

Peeking out, she found Nathaniel still on the sofa, phone in hand.

"My clothes," she demanded.

He didn't look up. "Trashed."

"Then get me something else!"

His gaze lifted, glacial. "Ask properly."

"Like hell." She slammed the door.

The wedding dress it was.

A knock interrupted her struggle with the heavy fabric. She cracked the door—Nathaniel stood there, holding men's pajamas.

The scent of her shampoo wafted between them. His gaze snagged on her towel-clad frame, damp hair clinging to collarbones.

His throat moved as he extended the clothes.

"Thanks," she muttered, snatching them.

"For nothing!" The door crashed shut.

Nathaniel barely yanked his hand back in time. Ungrateful brat.

The pajamas swallowed her whole—sleeves dangling past her fingertips, waistband loose enough to risk indecency.

Evelyn glared at her reflection. Three months of this? She'd survive—but barely.
###Chapter 7

Nathaniel had already left the room by the time Evelyn finished changing. Not that she cared where he went. Their marriage was merely a business arrangement with an expiration date - three short months before they'd go their separate ways forever.

Evelyn locked the door and surrendered to sleep.

At dawn, sharp knocks shattered her slumber. "Miss! Master Nathaniel sent these clothes for you!" The maid's shrill voice pierced through the wooden door.

Grumbling, Evelyn dragged herself up. Living under someone else's roof meant obeying their rules. She yanked open the door and snatched the garments.

After showering and dressing, Evelyn stepped out - only to be drenched by a putrid wave of icy liquid.

Giggles erupted behind her.

Blinking through the stench, Evelyn wiped her face to see a girl her age smirking. The stranger wore designer clothes and a superior expression, flanked by household staff. One maid clutched an empty basin - clearly the weapon used in this ambush.

Evelyn studied the dripping mess on her clothes before fixing the girl with a steady gaze. "Who are you? And what's your problem?"

The girl preened, glossy lips parting. "Abigail Grayson. Nathaniel's sister."

Ah. The infamous sister-in-law. "Charming introduction," Evelyn remarked. "Care to explain this welcome?"

Abigail sneered. "Consider it orientation. Marriage doesn't make you family. You'll never belong here."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Yet legally, I'm your sister-in-law. Shouldn't you show some respect?"

"Respect?" Abigail cackled. "When my brother didn't even share your bed last night? Please. He only married you to appease Grandfather. Once he recovers, you're out!"

So that was Nathaniel's game. Evelyn filed away the revelation.

Abigail continued her tirade. "Remember your place. In this house, my word is law when Nathaniel's absent. Understood?"

Evelyn nodded meekly. "Absolutely."

The submission pleased Abigail. "Good. Now if you'll excuse me, my manicurist is waiting-"

"Wait!" Evelyn interjected. "Since I'm new, perhaps you could explain the household rules? I'd hate to accidentally offend again."

Abigail rolled her eyes. "Ugh, must I spell everything out?"

Evelyn batted her lashes. "My memory's terrible. Maybe we could go to my room? I'll take notes."

Grumbling, Abigail followed. The moment they entered, Evelyn slammed and locked the door, trapping them inside.

Before Abigail could react, Evelyn seized her hair and dragged her kicking into the bathroom. "Now," Evelyn purred, pinning the shrieking girl over the toilet. "What exactly did you pour on me?"

Abigail trembled. "F-fish cleaning water!"

"Delightful." With that, Evelyn plunged Abigail's head into the bowl.

Thirty seconds later, she yanked the spluttering girl up. "Refreshing, isn't it?"

"You psychotic bitch!" Abigail gasped. "Nathaniel will-"

"Will what?" Evelyn interrupted. "You attacked first. Fish water for toilet water seems fair." She dunked Abigail again.

When resurfaced, Abigail screeched, "I'll make him divorce you!"

Evelyn beamed. "Would you? That'd be wonderful!"

The lack of reaction infuriated Abigail further. Evelyn finally released her, shoving the sopping mess into the hallway.

After stripping her ruined clothes, Evelyn wrapped herself in a towel. Her phone buzzed - Olivia Dawson, her colleague.

"Evelyn!" Olivia's panicked voice crackled through. "Emergency at work! Get here now!"
###Chapter 8

Evelyn hung up so abruptly that Olivia was left staring at the phone in disbelief.

Still wrapped in a towel, Evelyn rummaged through the closet, hoping to find something to wear. But all she found were Nathaniel’s clothes. With no other options, she grabbed a plain white T-shirt and slipped it on before rushing out.

Nathaniel’s shirt was so large on her that it fell past her knees, almost like an oversized dress.

When Evelyn arrived at Alpha Enterprises, she swiped her access card at the entrance. Olivia, looking unusually frantic, rushed to meet her.

"Evelyn! Finally! The manager wants to see you in his office—now. You should brace yourself."

"The manager?" Evelyn frowned. Olivia was never this nervous.

"What’s going on?"

Olivia glanced around before lowering her voice. "The entire company’s system crashed. All our important files are gone."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "And that’s my problem? Shouldn’t they call IT?"

Olivia bit her lip. "They’re already working on it. But Rachel told the manager the virus came from your computer—after you downloaded a game on company property."

She hesitated before adding, "Worse, the CEO invited investors to review our new project today, but the presentation file is corrupted. The manager is furious. He’s going to fire you!"

Rachel Thornton? The one everyone says has connections here?

Both Evelyn and Rachel were interns competing for the only permanent position at Alpha Enterprises.

Evelyn had earned her spot through academic excellence, while rumors claimed Rachel was the manager’s niece.

Now, the pieces clicked.

Before Evelyn could knock on the manager’s door, she heard Rachel’s voice inside, soothingly saying, "Uncle Edward, don’t worry. The IT team will fix it. This is all Evelyn’s fault for gaming during work hours—"

Edward Whitmore snapped, "Where is that girl? Why isn’t she here yet?"

Evelyn knocked and entered. "You wanted to see me, sir?"

Edward’s glare was icy. "Finally decided to show up? Do you think this is your personal playground? No call, no show yesterday, late today—and now you’ve crashed our systems!"

Evelyn kept her tone polite. "Apologies, sir. I got married yesterday, and I was delayed this morning due to… complications."

Edward scoffed. "Married? If that’s true, why didn’t you request leave? This company isn’t your personal property!"

Evelyn blinked innocently. "It’s my first marriage. I’ll remember to file the paperwork next time."

Edward was speechless. Rachel sneered. "Pathetic excuse. Just admit you skipped work!"

Then the office door swung open.

Frederick Kingsley, the CEO, stood there with a tall, imposing man beside him—Nathaniel Grayson.

They had arrived just in time to hear Evelyn’s explanation.

Nathaniel’s sharp gaze flickered over her, unreadable.

Edward jumped to his feet. "Mr. Kingsley! Mr. Grayson! Please, come in!"

Rachel’s eyes lit up when she saw Nathaniel, her expression turning dreamy.

Evelyn, however, barely suppressed a groan. Him again?

Frederick’s voice was stern. "What’s this about our systems crashing?"

Edward pointed at Evelyn. "Our intern downloaded games on company property, infecting our network. IT is trying to recover the data, but—"

Frederick’s face darkened. "And she’s still employed?"

Edward shook his head frantically. "No! I’ll terminate her immediately!"

Rachel smirked in triumph.

Nathaniel’s expression remained cold as he glanced at Evelyn, then said indifferently, "Perhaps we should reschedule, Mr. Kingsley."

Frederick paled. He had worked tirelessly to secure this meeting.

Evelyn spotted Olivia’s anxious face outside and remembered—this project was Olivia’s first major lead. If it failed, her career would suffer.

"Mr. Grayson!" Evelyn called out.

Nathaniel paused.

Evelyn stepped forward. "Your time is valuable, but since you’re already here, wouldn’t it be a waste to leave without seeing what we’ve worked on?"

Nathaniel arched a brow. "You have nothing to show."

"I’ll have the presentation ready by the time you finish your coffee."

Frederick and Edward gaped.

Rachel rolled her eyes. As if.

After a beat, Nathaniel said coolly, "Very well. Mr. Kingsley, I could use some coffee before I go."

Frederick snapped into action. "Someone get Mr. Grayson coffee—now!"

Rachel seized the opportunity, flouncing off to play hostess.

Evelyn returned to her desk and plugged in a flash drive.

Olivia hovered nervously. "What are you doing?"

"Running an antivirus."

Olivia groaned. "The hackers bypassed our firewalls. Antivirus won’t help!"

Evelyn smirked. "Worth a shot, right?"
###Chapter 9

Evelyn noticed Olivia's optimism, while she herself had already braced for the worst.

Accepting that the project she'd poured a month into was beyond saving was disheartening. But dwelling on it wouldn’t change a thing.

With a sigh, Evelyn headed to the pantry. "Do your best, Olivia. I’ll make you some coffee to help you focus."

"Thanks!" Olivia replied. At the same moment, a red progress bar flashed on the computer screen.

The moment it filled, Evelyn cracked the password. Her fingers flew across the keyboard as she accessed a hidden dialog box. A final keystroke sent her message.

[What’s your grudge?]

The hacker’s stunned reply came instantly. [Who are you? How did you bypass the AJ League’s encryption?]

Evelyn’s fingers danced. [That’s not the point. The real question is—why target Alpha Enterprises? If you have a problem, take it up with the person who wronged you. Don’t drag innocent people into it.]

The hacker retaliated, but every attack was intercepted by Evelyn’s defenses. Frustration turned to reluctant admiration. Whoever was on the other side was better than him.

—

By the time Olivia returned with coffee, Evelyn had restored the system—files and all.

"It’s fixed! You’re incredible! How did you do it?"

Evelyn spun the USB drive between her fingers, leaning back in her chair. "Bought this antivirus online for a dollar during a flash sale. Claims to work against all viruses. Guess they weren’t lying. I’ll leave them a glowing review."

Olivia frowned. "Wait—you fixed it with antivirus? The tech team said that wouldn’t work. Maybe they’re the useless ones."

Evelyn took the coffee with a nod. "You should probably grab that file and show it to Mr. Kingsley now."

"Oh! Right!" Olivia blew her a kiss and rushed off.

Colleagues swarmed Evelyn, demanding the antivirus link.

"Later," she dismissed, sipping her coffee. Her gaze flicked toward Nathaniel’s office. He probably hasn’t finished his coffee yet.

—

Inside, Rachel had been striking suggestive poses near Nathaniel, showcasing her legs. But his attention never wavered from his cup. Her legs were cramping by the time Olivia knocked.

"Mr. Kingsley, the file’s ready. The meeting can proceed as planned."

Frederick’s relief was palpable. "The system’s repaired?"

"Yes! Evelyn restored everything."

"Impressive." Frederick stood, gesturing toward the meeting room. "Mr. Grayson, we’re ready."

Nathaniel set down his cup, his sharp eyes narrowing thoughtfully. Every movement exuded power as he rose.

Rachel seethed. How did Evelyn pull that off?

—

Fifteen minutes later, Nathaniel exited the meeting room, his expression unreadable. Frederick trailed behind, shoulders slumped.

As Nathaniel passed Evelyn’s desk, he paused. His cold gaze settled on her, lips curling in a humorless smile. "Bravo, Mr. Kingsley. Your talented employee just wasted an hour of my time."

Frederick flushed. "I—I apologize, Mr. Grayson."

Nathaniel turned away without another glance.

Evelyn frowned as Rachel sauntered over, smirking. "All that effort, and he still hated your plan. Pathetic."

Ignoring her, Evelyn turned to Olivia, who emerged from the meeting room in tears.

"What happened?"

Olivia choked out, "The key data was full of errors. Mr. Grayson called our proposal garbage."

Frederick stormed back, lashing out at Olivia. "Is this the quality of your work? Basic mistakes everywhere! Maybe you should find another job!"

Olivia bowed her head. "I’m sorry, I—"

Evelyn caught Rachel’s smug grin. "Mr. Kingsley, the errors aren’t Olivia’s fault. The virus corrupted the data. I should’ve checked before sending her in. I’ll resign."

Frederick hesitated, but Edward cut in. "Resign? You’re fired. Pack your things and get out."

—

At the elevator, Olivia caught up, guilt-stricken. "Evelyn, I should quit—"

Evelyn shook her head. "Edward wanted me gone anyway. Don’t throw yourself under the bus."

"But Rachel’s getting promoted now! She doesn’t deserve it!"

Evelyn shrugged. "Doesn’t matter." She waved and stepped into the elevator.

As the doors opened downstairs, Rachel appeared, dumping a box of Evelyn’s belongings at her feet. "Forgot your things. Manager said your desk is mine now."

Evelyn calmly gathered her stuff. "Let me give you some advice."

Rachel crossed her arms. "Make it quick."

Evelyn leaned in, whispering, "Karma’s a bitch."

Rachel scoffed. "Whatever."

—

Evelyn stepped outside, arms full, when a sleek black Mercedes pulled up beside her.

Lucas stepped out. "Mr. Grayson wants to see you."

Evelyn brushed past him. "Not interested."

He blocked her path. "Get in the car."

After a brief struggle, she relented, sliding into the backseat.

Rachel gaped from the entrance. A limited-edition Mercedes? How does Evelyn rate that?
###Chapter 10

Evelyn watched the sleek Mercedes vanish around the corner. A bitter taste filled her mouth as she stormed back into the office, ready to spin a tale that would ruin her rival’s reputation.

“Guess why Evelyn left so smugly?” Rachel announced, her voice dripping with venom. “She’s some rich geezer’s sugar baby! No wonder she doesn’t care about losing her job.”

The word sugar baby sent a ripple of scandalized whispers through the room. Colleagues swarmed Rachel, hungry for details.

With dramatic flair, Rachel painted the scene. “Out of sheer kindness, I went to return Evelyn’s things—only to catch her sprawled in the lap of some balding, pot-bellied old man in a luxury car! Use your imagination—I won’t spell it out.”

“How old?” someone gasped.

“At least sixty,” Rachel sneered.

“Ew! That’s grandpa territory! Who knew Evelyn was so desperate?”

“Never trust a pretty face,” another chimed in.

Olivia slammed her hands on her desk, furious. “Stop lying, Rachel! Evelyn isn’t like that!”

Rachel smirked. “Oh? Then check the security footage. See for yourself—Evelyn climbed into a Mercedes right outside.”

Olivia clenched her fists. She didn’t have the clearance to access the footage.

Rachel was ruthless. First, she’d forced Evelyn out—now she was smearing her name. Disgusting.

Defeated, Olivia sat back down, fuming. But as she logged into her computer, something odd caught her eye.

“Huh? What’s this folder?”

A coworker gasped. “I’ve got one too!”

“Same here. Let’s open it…”

Silence fell. Then, one by one, heads turned toward Rachel—eyes filled with revulsion.

Rachel bristled. “What’s everyone staring at?”

Olivia stood, triumphant. “So you’re the one slacking off and getting our systems hacked!”

Rachel paled. “That’s slander! Prove it!”

Olivia smirked. “The proof’s right here. You scammed some online gamer for virtual loot, then ghosted him. Turns out, he was a hacker—and he exposed everything.”

She scrolled through damning screenshots—Rachel’s chat logs, surveillance footage of her tampering with files.

“He sent this folder to everyone,” Olivia added.

Rachel lunged for her computer. The evidence was undeniable.

How?!

Frederick Kingsley stormed out, face thunderous. “Rachel Thornton! Pack your things—you’re fired.”

Rachel’s blood ran cold. Had he seen the folder too?

Edward Whitmore rushed out, looking equally grim.

Rachel grabbed his arm. “Uncle, help me—”

Edward shoved her away and walked off. He wanted no part in her disgrace.

Within minutes, Rachel was escorted out—humiliated, jobless, and stripped of her bonus.

Karma was brutal.

Olivia grinned, texting Evelyn the good news.

Meanwhile, the Mercedes glided through the city. Evelyn sat at the far end of the backseat, clutching her belongings. Beside her, Nathaniel—her new husband—hadn’t so much as glanced at her since she entered. He was too absorbed in his phone, expression unreadable.

Her phone buzzed. Olivia’s message detailed Rachel’s downfall and Edward’s reprimand.

Evelyn smirked. Exactly as planned.

After the hacker explained why he’d breached Alpha Enterprises’ system, she’d given him one instruction: Target the guilty party. Leave the innocent alone.

Rachel’s cruelty had earned her this.

Crossing her legs, Evelyn’s bare thighs brushed together. The oversized men’s T-shirt she wore rode up slightly, revealing porcelain skin that gleamed under the sunlight.

Nathaniel’s gaze flickered—irritated.

“Is this how you try to get a man’s attention?”

Evelyn blinked. “Excuse me?”

He set his phone aside. “What are you wearing?”

She glanced down. “Oh. Your shirt. The maid’s clothes got ruined, so I borrowed this.”

Nathaniel pinched the bridge of his nose. “Did I say you could?”

Evelyn rolled her eyes. “Should I have called and asked? It’s just a shirt. Are all old men this petty?”

Besides, she didn’t even have his number.

A vein throbbed in his temple. “What did you just say?”

She flashed a saccharine smile. “I said—do you want your new wife making headlines for streaking the day after the wedding?”

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. Old man?

“What if I said I don’t care?”

Evelyn gritted her teeth. “Then I’ll strip right now and hand it back.”

His lips twitched. “Go ahead.”

If luck was a deity, Evelyn had clearly pissed it off. Why else would she be stuck with this infuriating man?

After a beat, she shrugged. “Fine. You asked for it.”
###Chapter 11

Lucas Sinclair wore a troubled expression as he sat in the passenger seat. With a quick gesture, he signaled the driver to pull over. Once the car stopped, he motioned for the driver to step out with him.

Inside the car, Evelyn Whitmore gripped the hem of the oversized white T-shirt, her face sullen. Slowly, she began lifting it.

Nathaniel Grayson leaned back, his forehead resting lazily on his knuckles. His indifferent gaze settled on her, though a flicker of amusement danced in his sharp eyes.

——

Meanwhile, back at Alpha Enterprises, Edward Whitmore—the general manager—was being torn apart by his boss, Frederick Kingsley. The reason? Allowing unqualified relatives into the company without proper vetting. Frederick issued an ultimatum: if Edward failed to recover the day’s losses and salvage the Holden deal, he’d be packing his bags just like his incompetent relative, Rachel Thornton.

Desperate, Edward sped off in his car, frantically calling contacts for a solution. Just as panic set in, he spotted Nathaniel’s sleek black Mercedes parked by the roadside.

Nathaniel was still here. A stroke of luck! Maybe he could explain the mishap with the proposal and claw back some hope.

Heart pounding, Edward parked nearby and jogged toward the luxury vehicle.

The heavily tinted windows made it impossible to see inside.

Edward hesitated, then leaned closer, knocking lightly. "Mr. Nathaniel? Are you there, sir?"

No response. The soundproofing was too good.

Is the car empty? Where could he have gone?

Glancing around and seeing no one, Edward reached for the door handle.

Inside, Nathaniel remained unmoved, watching Evelyn with detached interest. She, however, wasn’t about to surrender.

After being humiliated by his sister earlier, she refused to be a doormat for the Graysons for the next three months.

Gritting her teeth, she yanked the shirt off.

Luckily, she wore a modest tank top underneath—skimpy but not indecent.

Nathaniel’s eyes darkened. She actually did it.

Then—

The door swung open. Sunlight and cold air rushed in.

Before Evelyn could react, a strong arm yanked her against a firm chest. The scent of ambergris and tobacco enveloped her, making her pulse spike.

Nathaniel moved lightning-fast, draping his suit jacket over her and pressing her close to shield her from view.

Edward gaped.

Nathaniel Grayson was embracing a woman—her face buried in his chest, wrapped in his clothes, her bare legs exposed.

Edward’s stomach dropped.

He’d just interrupted something very private.

Sweat beaded on his forehead. "I—I’m so sorry, Mr. Nathaniel! I called out, but you didn’t answer, so I—"

Nathaniel’s icy glare cut him off. "Get. Out."

Edward slammed the door shut, trembling.

He was dead.

——

Evelyn squirmed, struggling to breathe. "What the hell was that?"

Nathaniel looked down at her, incredulous. She had the nerve to be annoyed? If he hadn’t acted, she’d be half-naked in front of a stranger.

Did she have no shame?

Releasing her, he snapped, "Put the shirt back on. You’re the Graysons’ lady now. Act like it."

Shameful? You’re the one who demanded it. Evelyn smirked. "So I can wear your shirt?"

Nathaniel’s lips twitched. Vengeful little thing.

"Fine."

She scoffed, yanking the shirt back on.

Nathaniel turned away, slamming the door behind him as he stepped out.

——

Outside, Edward was stammering to Lucas. "I swear, I didn’t mean to—please explain to Mr. Nathaniel—"

Lucas spotted Nathaniel approaching. "Sir—"

Edward spun around, bowing deeply. "Mr. Nathaniel, I’m so sorry! I didn’t mean to—"

Nathaniel’s voice was lethal. "What did you see?"

Edward paled. "Nothing! Absolutely nothing!"

Lucas stepped forward. "Sir, your sister called earlier. I stepped away to answer—my fault for not noticing him."

Nathaniel said nothing, lighting a cigarette. He exhaled slowly before turning to Edward. "Why are you here?"

Edward rushed to explain. "The proposal error—it was sabotaged by an intern! Not our company’s standard! Please give us another chance—"

Nathaniel arched a brow. "Sabotaged? By the one who fixed your system?"

Edward hesitated. "Uh—no, another intern. But both are fired! No more mistakes, I swear! If you could just spare twenty minutes—"

"No." Nathaniel’s expression darkened. She was fired?

He signaled Lucas. Assuming Evelyn was dressed, he turned back to the car.

Edward chased after him. "Mr. Nathaniel, this project is worth your time—just twenty minutes!"

Lucas blocked him. "He said no. Push it, and you’ll regret it."

Edward backed off, watching helplessly as the Mercedes drove away.

Then—

The rear window rolled down.

Edward’s blood ran cold.

The woman in Nathaniel’s car looked exactly like Evelyn Whitmore—the intern he’d fired that morning.
###Chapter 12

Evelyn had slipped back into Nathaniel's T-shirt but layered his suit jacket over it. The chill from the cracked car window had seeped into her bones.

"Word is you're unemployed now?" Nathaniel's baritone voice cut through her daze as she stared blankly at the passing cityscape.

Her lips curled. "Thanks to you."

He flipped through financial reports without looking up. "I gave that company every opportunity. Their persistent errors prove they're unworthy of investment."

A yawn escaped her. "Save the lecture. Not my circus anymore."

Nathaniel paused mid-page. "If you need an internship placement—"

"Stop the car!" Evelyn practically launched herself at the window, eyes lighting up. Before the Mercedes fully braked, she'd thrown open the door.

She sprinted to the approaching bus, securing a window seat. With deliberate slowness, she flipped her thumbs-up into a thumbs-down at the idling luxury sedan, then disappeared behind closing bus doors.

Lucas massaged his temples. Only Evelyn Whitmore would dare disrespect Nathaniel Grayson so blatantly—the man who commanded fear across New Capital's business elite.

"Sir, she took your Brioni jacket. The ribbon-cutting at—"

"Have another delivered." Nathaniel's stormy expression darkened further as he resumed reviewing documents.

"Also, your sister called from the hospital."

His head snapped up. "Abigail was fine yesterday."

Lucas cleared his throat. "Miss Evelyn allegedly... dunked her head in a toilet. Drank several mouthfuls. You know Miss Abigail's germaphobia—she's been vomiting nonstop. Needed IV fluids."

"Prognosis?"

"Full recovery in 48 hours. Though she's demanding retribution."

Nathaniel's face remained impassive. "Grandmother spoiled her rotten. Evelyn doesn't start fights—she finishes them. Let this be Abigail's lesson in restraint."

Lucas blinked at his employer's uncharacteristic leniency. "Shall we arrange employment for Miss Evelyn?"

"Just monitor her for three months. Ensure she doesn't embarrass the family name."

The assistant nodded, reassessing his assumptions. Of course Nathaniel's heart still belonged to Amelia Rivers—their star-crossed love thwarted by family feuds. No wonder old Mr. Grayson kept arranging marriages.

———

Evelyn rode the bus home to pack. Three months at the Grayson estate required her own wardrobe—she refused to keep borrowing Nathaniel's clothes.

Victoria Blackwood blocked her at the doorway, lips curling. "I thought you were the takeout."

Evelyn sidestepped her stepmother, but Cassandra materialized, sneering at the men's jacket. "Whose bed did you crawl out of this time?"

Before Evelyn could respond, Cassandra shrieked, "Father! Look what your daughter's wearing!"

Gregory Whitmore stormed out, face darkening. "Explain yourself, Evelyn."

Victoria clutched her pearls. "A proper young lady doesn't parade in men's clothing! Our family has standards!"

"Probably hooking on street corners," Cassandra hissed. "Too good for Mother's matchmaking, but not for random—"

"My clothes got ruined this morning," Evelyn cut in calmly. "This is borrowed. Temporary."

Gregory's eyes narrowed. "And last night?"

"Found an apartment. Came to pack my things." The Grayson mansion was merely a three-month rental—paid in time, not cash.

"You're leaving?" Gregory frowned. "You have a home here."

Victoria tsked. "Living with some man? What about your virtue? Our reputation—"

"Please." Evelyn's laugh held no warmth. "No one remembers I exist. Nothing I do could possibly tarnish the illustrious Whitmores."

She turned to Cassandra. "Unlike dear sister—the disgraced actress. One tabloid photo with your sugar daddy, and—"

"You bitch!" Cassandra lunged, then froze. The jacket's inner lining bore the FA Couture insignia—a VIP-only bespoke line. How did this nobody access such luxury?

Gregory finally waved a dismissive hand. "Go if you must. This house reeks of bad luck anyway."

Evelyn ascended the stairs, leaving her sputtering stepfamily below. As she changed, Cassandra barged in again—then gaped at the designer label.

The game had just gotten interesting.
###Chapter 13

Evelyn snatched the jacket hastily. "Tell me the truth, Evelyn. Where did you get this designer blazer?" Cassandra's eyes narrowed suspiciously. "How would someone like you even know a man who wears clothes this luxurious?"

Evelyn glanced at the garment dismissively. "Expensive? Some random uncle 'kindly' lent it to me. Not that I know him well."

Cassandra smirked, recognizing Evelyn's provincial ignorance. "Obviously. A country bumpkin like you could never move in those circles." She sneered, "Get it cleaned and return it immediately. Don't get any ideas - sophisticated men don't waste time on peasant girls."

Evelyn chuckled, unfazed. "Speaking of men...where's your husband?"

Cassandra's expression darkened momentarily before she lifted her chin haughtily. "I changed my mind last minute. Marriage isn't for me - I prefer being an independent, high-value woman!"

"You canceled with the Graysons?" Evelyn raised an intrigued brow. "A first-tier family? Did their status...disappoint you?"

"Status means nothing!" Cassandra scoffed, flicking her hair. "At thirty, Nathaniel's never had a girlfriend. Clearly something's...lacking." She made a crude gesture. "I won't waste my prime years on a defective man, no matter how obsessed he is with me!"

Evelyn barely suppressed her laughter. "Such thorough consideration. Congratulations on your narrow escape!"

After packing, Evelyn bid a brief farewell to Gregory before leaving. Cassandra immediately tailed her taxi, determined to uncover the mystery man behind the expensive jacket.

If yesterday's humiliating canceled wedding could be redeemed by snagging a billionaire, she'd regain all her social standing!

The taxi stopped at Old Town Street. Evelyn entered a modest diner alone with her luggage.

From her illegally parked car, Cassandra sneered. "Still eating at dumps like this? Some habits never change."

A sharp rap interrupted her. A traffic officer stood outside. "No parking on pedestrian streets. License please."

Cassandra rolled her eyes. "I'm a celebrity! I'm avoiding causing a mob scene - really, I'm doing you a favor!"

"Your fame doesn't exempt you from laws." The officer impassively called for a tow truck.

"What? Do you know how many followers I have?" Cassandra shrieked, drawing stares from unimpressed passersby.

Humiliated, she could only watch her car get towed - just as Evelyn exited the diner.

Remembering her mission, Cassandra slipped through the crowd to follow Evelyn into a luxury boutique.

Her jaw dropped as Evelyn confidently selected items from the most exclusive section before exiting through a rear door.

"Miss Cassandra!" The manager intercepted her. "Your selections are ready for payment."

"What selections? I just walked in!"

The manager smiled tightly. "Your assistant already chose these according to your measurements. Cash or card?"

Whispers erupted among staff:
"Can't afford it?"
"Her outfit's two seasons outdated..."
"Rumor says she's broke since leaving the industry..."

Cassandra's face burned. "I can buy this entire store!" She slapped down her card, seething as thousands vanished.

Only then did she realize - Evelyn had played her! That traffic officer was probably part of the setup too!

"Curses, Evelyn!"

Rushing outside, Cassandra saw Evelyn boarding another taxi. She frantically hailed one to pursue.

They arrived at an opulent estate in the city center - land only billionaires could afford. Cassandra's eyes bulged. "How did that backwater hick get in there?"

Just then, a black sedan arrived. Abigail Grayson emerged, assisted by maids, looking pale from her hospital stay.

"Excuse me," Cassandra approached nervously under Abigail's disdainful once-over. "Who owns this property?"

Abigail's lip curled. "Why would trash like you be here?"

"I-I'm looking for my sister. She just entered..."

Abigail sighed impatiently. "Name?"
###Chapter 14

Cassandra opened her mouth. "My sister's name is—"

Abigail suddenly gagged at the overpowering perfume scent clinging to Cassandra.

One of the maids immediately shoved Cassandra aside. "Get out of the way! Our young mistress isn't available right now!"

"Young miss, are you alright?"

Abigail was still retching violently as the maids helped her inside.

Cassandra clenched her fists in frustration. She hadn't even gotten her answer before being dismissed like some unwanted pest. The imposing mansion intimidated her too much to make a scene.

The Grayson family driver rolled down his window. "You should leave. This isn't the kind of place for nosy people like you."

Cassandra turned sharply. "Are you their driver? Tell me who lives here."

The driver eyed her warily. "That's confidential. But I heard they recently hired new maids. Your sister might be among them."

'A maid? Evelyn?' Cassandra frowned. 'But she was interning at Alpha Enterprises.'

Before she could ask more, the car disappeared into the garage. Confused, Cassandra called an old classmate working at Alpha Enterprises. The shocking revelation? Evelyn had been fired.

'Fired! So this is why she's working as a maid here? All that talk about renting was a lie!' Cassandra's lips curled in triumph. 'That expensive blazer she wore home must have been stolen from her employers!'

Satisfied with her discovery, Cassandra strutted away, eager to report back to her father.

Upstairs, Evelyn leaned against the floor-to-ceiling window, watching Cassandra's retreating figure with amusement.

The next afternoon, an elegant elderly woman arrived in a stretch Hummer.

"Grandmother!" Abigail rushed forward.

Margaret Grayson embraced her granddaughter with concern. "I took the first flight after your call. Abigail, you've lost so much weight!"

Abigail sniffled dramatically. "Grandmother, Nathaniel's new wife has been tormenting me since their wedding. She made me so sick I had to be hospitalized!"

Margaret's sharp eyes glinted dangerously. "I'd like to meet this new granddaughter-in-law who dares bully my precious girl. Bring this Evelyn down immediately!"

Abigail clung to Margaret on the sofa, whispering sweet nothings while secretly gloating. 'Evelyn's going to get what she deserves!'

Soon, the housekeeper escorted Evelyn downstairs.

"You're Evelyn?" Margaret scrutinized her from head to toe.

Evelyn nodded. "That's me. How may I help you, ma'am?"

Margaret's expression darkened. "I hear you bullied Abigail so badly she needed hospitalization. Do you think marrying Nathaniel makes you mistress of this house?"

Evelyn instantly understood the situation—and Abigail's twisted version of events. She stood her ground calmly. "Ma'am, it's 'an eye for an eye.' Abigail doused me with filthy water yesterday. I simply returned the favor. Hardly bullying."

Margaret turned to Abigail. "Is this true?"

Tears welled in Abigail's eyes. "She's lying! All the servants can vouch for me!"

On cue, several maids stepped forward.

"I saw everything. Young miss never provoked madam."

"I can testify too!"

"Same here!"

Margaret's stern gaze returned to Evelyn. "Well?"

Evelyn sighed at the united front against her. "I've said my piece. If you won't believe me, there's nothing more I can do."

Margaret scoffed. "Still defiant? Clearly your family failed to teach you manners. Very well—you'll copy our house rules one hundred times. No meals until you finish!"

Evelyn barely suppressed an eye roll. These Grayson women and their obsession with 'teaching lessons.'

"Thank you for defending me!" Abigail preened, offering Margaret a pastry. "You must be hungry after traveling. Have a snack while lunch is prepared."

Evelyn suddenly intervened. "Wait! She can't eat that!"

Abigail glared. "This is our house. Grandmother can eat whatever she wants." She turned sweetly to Margaret. "Ignore her. Please, have a bite."

Before Evelyn could stop them, Margaret took a large bite.

Abigail smirked triumphantly. "Why aren't you copying those rules yet? Remember—one hundred times!"

Suddenly, Margaret's face turned blue. She gasped for air, eyes bulging.

"Grandmother? What's wrong?" Abigail panicked.

Evelyn rushed forward, but Abigail blocked her. "Don't touch her!"

"She's choking! Move!"

"You're the danger here!" Abigail fought viciously to keep Evelyn away.

In desperation, Evelyn shoved Abigail aside and grabbed Margaret from behind. She performed abdominal thrusts, jumping forcefully.

"Help! Evelyn's killing Grandmother!" Abigail screamed as servants rushed in but hesitated to intervene while Evelyn held Margaret.

"Stay back!" Evelyn warned, stepping away with Margaret.

"Release madam!"

"Don't do anything rash!"

A commanding voice cut through the chaos. "What's going on here?"

The room chilled as Nathaniel entered.

Abigail threw herself at him. "Save Grandmother! Evelyn's murdering her!"

Nathaniel's dangerous gaze locked onto Evelyn. "Explain why you're assaulting an old woman."

Evelyn opened her mouth, but Abigail interrupted. "She made Grandmother angry, so Grandmother punished her. Now she's taking revenge! Nathaniel, she's insane! Divorce her now!"

Nathaniel pushed Abigail toward Lucas, his murderous focus remaining on Evelyn. "Let. Her. Go. Now."

"Wait—" Evelyn began.

Margaret suddenly coughed violently. Evelyn released her, and servants immediately surrounded the elderly woman.

Seeing his grandmother struggling to breathe, Nathaniel grabbed Evelyn by the throat. "How dare you?"

Evelyn's feet dangled as she choked. The deadly intent in Nathaniel's crimson eyes was unmistakable.
###Chapter 15

Evelyn's face turned an alarming shade of purple.

Margaret had finally caught her breath and gasped, "Nathaniel! Let her go!"

Nathaniel immediately released his grip, shoving Evelyn aside before rushing to his grandmother's side. "Are you alright?"

Margaret waved a trembling hand. "I'm fine... Earlier, I... I choked on a prune pit, but Evelyn saved me using the Heimlich maneuver. See that pit on the floor? That's what I coughed up."

Nathaniel froze, his gaze dropping to the small prune pit on the ground. When he looked back at Evelyn, his brow furrowed slightly.

Evelyn stood up, rubbing her sore arm where Nathaniel had thrown her down. She approached Margaret and explained, "I baked those pastries for myself this morning, Ma'am. I leave the pits in because I enjoy the slight bitterness they add when baked. They're not suitable for elderly consumption though, and I sincerely apologize."

She gave a respectful bow before straightening to face Nathaniel. "You should call a doctor to check on her, Mr... I mean, Nathaniel." With that, she turned and headed upstairs.

Nathaniel watched Evelyn's retreating figure with conflicting emotions.

The incident left Margaret shaken. She only fell asleep after being helped to her room. That afternoon, the family doctor examined her and confirmed her blood pressure was normal.

After the doctor left, Margaret regained some energy. "Could you step outside for a moment, Abigail? I need to speak with your brother."

Abigail hesitated, wanting to eavesdrop, but Nathaniel's stern look forced her to leave.

With just the two of them, Nathaniel approached the bed. "What is it, Grandmother?"

Margaret smiled warmly at her handsome grandson. "I'm perfectly fine now, Nathaniel."

"That's good to hear."

"How did you meet Evelyn?" Margaret asked curiously.

"It was... coincidental."

Margaret nodded slowly. "She's a good girl. I like her very much."

A flicker of surprise crossed Nathaniel's eyes. "Just because she saved you?" He found this sudden change puzzling, considering Margaret had been punishing Evelyn moments before.

Margaret's eyes twinkled. "She remains calm under pressure, neither domineering nor falsely meek. When you misunderstood her, she calmly explained everything and apologized. She's sensible and understanding."

Nathaniel fell silent, remembering how he'd nearly choked her in his rage.

"You haven't slept with her yet, have you?"

The abrupt question caught Nathaniel off guard.

Margaret chuckled. "You're in your thirties, for heaven's sake! Why so embarrassed?"

Nathaniel had no response.

"I know you married quickly to appease your stubborn grandfather, but I think you chose well. Marriage isn't child's play. I hope you two will be happy together!"

Nathaniel hesitated to explain the true nature of their arrangement.

Margaret continued, "I missed your wedding because I was with your grandfather before his surgery, but I'll bless your union today. Make sure to consummate your marriage so your grandfather can meet his great-grandchild after recovery!"

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "Grandmother, about that—"

Margaret interrupted sternly, "If you don't listen, I'll tell your grandfather this is a sham marriage. You know his temper—it could make him relapse!"

Nathaniel rubbed his temples. "I'll have dinner brought to you later. Rest now." He turned to leave.

Margaret called after him, "I'll be checking tonight, so don't disappoint me!"

Returning to their room, Nathaniel found Evelyn at the desk, engrossed in writing. She didn't even glance up when he entered.

He approached and looked over her shoulder. "Homework?"

"Copying house rules," Evelyn replied without looking up. "Twenty-first century and you still have written family rules. How medieval."

Nathaniel took her pen. "Stop. No one will punish you again."

Evelyn stretched. "Guess I'll shower and sleep then!"

After being nearly strangled earlier, Evelyn understood the power imbalance between them. Nathaniel could crush her effortlessly. It wasn't fear, just pragmatism—she wouldn't make her life harder than necessary.

For the next three months, her priority was peaceful coexistence with the Graysons, avoiding conflict and minimizing contact with Nathaniel. When the time came, she'd simply leave.

Evelyn stood to pass Nathaniel, keeping her distance, but he grabbed her arm suddenly.

"Ah!" She winced. "What now?"

Nathaniel's gaze sharpened. "So you do feel pain." His grip had found the sorest spot on her arm—where it had struck the coffee table when he threw her down earlier.

Her resolve to avoid conflict wavered under his provocation. "Thanks to you," she snapped.

Startled, Nathaniel released her. "Go downstairs and let the doctor check that."

"Not necessary. It's just a bruise." Evelyn shook him off and headed to the bathroom.

After showering and changing into pajamas, she prepared for bed.

"Come here," Nathaniel commanded from the armchair.

Evelyn eyed him warily. "Why should I?"

He gestured to the first-aid kit on the table. "For your arm."

"No thanks."

Nathaniel's stare turned dangerous. "Are you coming, or shall I come to you?"

Grudgingly, Evelyn approached and thrust out her injured arm. "Fine. Hurry up."

The maid had brought the kit, and Nathaniel had intended for Evelyn to tend her own wound. But she'd misunderstood, thinking he meant to do it himself.

Nathaniel had never served anyone, nor would he. Yet he opened the kit, dipped a cotton swab in medicated oil, and gently applied it to her bruise.

Evelyn had extended her arm to annoy him, never expecting this. "Feeling guilty about today?" she asked.

Nathaniel remained expressionless. "I'm taking responsibility for accidentally hurting you. As for my grandmother, don't hold a grudge—she won't be here long."

"Why would I? She's not a bad person."

Nathaniel looked up. "She made you copy house rules. Doesn't that make her bad?"

Evelyn scoffed. "Bad people don't punish with copying. That's the worst a good person can imagine. The truly bad ones always—" She cut herself off.

"Always what?" Nathaniel pressed.

Evelyn saw no reason to share her past. "Nothing. Are you done? I want to sleep."

Nathaniel still held her arm after applying the ointment. Thinking he doubted her commitment, Evelyn said firmly, "Relax. I promised three months of cooperation, and I'll treat it like a job. Your sister's a pain, but your grandmother was just protecting her. I understand—no hard feelings."

Nathaniel studied Evelyn thoughtfully. He'd assumed her rash and simple-minded, but she showed surprising understanding.

She was also unexpectedly attractive—long lashes framing lively eyes, a youthful face with dimples that animated every expression.

Suddenly, Nathaniel stood, startling Evelyn. "What—?"

Without warning, he scooped her up bridal-style.

Evelyn stiffened in shock. "What are you doing?!" Her question was cut short as she landed on the bed.

Nathaniel removed his jacket, yanked off his tie, and unbuttoned his shirt with aggressive movements.

Evelyn tried to scramble up, but his hands pushed her back down. For the first time, she saw a man's Adam's apple and chest muscles up close—and had to admit they were distracting.

"Stop joking! Remember I'm not your type!"

Nathaniel caged her beneath him, gaze predatory. "What if I ignore that for one night of fun?"

Evelyn opened her mouth to scream, but Nathaniel covered it.

"Mmph!"
###Chapter 16

Evelyn's eyes flew open in shock when she realized Nathaniel was doing one-handed pushups above her. His free hand covered her mouth while the blanket draped over their bodies, leaving only their heads exposed.

Their faces hovered inches apart, his movements making it seem like they were tangled in something far more intimate.

Uncomfortable, Evelyn shoved his hand away. "Mister, you—"

Nathaniel dipped lower, his breath hot against her ear. "I thought you promised to do your job properly. Cooperate, or this won't work."

Evelyn stiffened, then caught movement at the door—Margaret peeking in.

Oh. So that's the game.

Lowering her voice, she smirked. "Want me to moan for realism?"

Nathaniel's eyes darkened with amusement. "Do you even know how?"

"Watch me."

She inhaled dramatically before launching into an exaggerated performance. "Oh, darling! Yes! Right there! Harder! Mmm—"

Nathaniel's smirk vanished. He clamped a hand over her mouth, his expression strained.

Evelyn muffled a laugh. The door clicked shut—Margaret had seen enough.

"She's gone," Evelyn huffed, shoving him off. "Get up."

Nathaniel rolled away, snatching his discarded shirt.

Evelyn sat up, eyeing his toned torso. "Impressive discipline. Didn't expect abs like that from an old man."

Nathaniel froze. "Old man?"

"Keep staring like that, and I'll think you're obsessed with me."

Evelyn wiped imaginary drool. "Only your abs. The rest? Not my type."

Nathaniel stalked back, gripping her chin. "And what is your type?"

"Sweet boys who call me Mommy."

He scoffed. "That's not a man."

"Then what's yours? Supermodels? Bombshells?"

Nathaniel leaned in, his voice low. "Anyone who isn't a bratty cheerleader in bed."

He released her and headed to the bathroom.

Evelyn smirked. They'd be sharing a room tonight—Margaret's orders. Awkward, but unavoidable.

When Nathaniel returned, Evelyn was slumped against the headboard, phone in hand, mid-game. Asleep.

Wants a man to call her Mommy but falls asleep playing games.

He snatched her phone, locked it, and tossed it aside. After a moment's hesitation, he tugged the blanket over her.

Then he retreated to the sofa.

Morning came, and Nathaniel was already gone.

Evelyn lounged in bed, scrolling until a message from Sebastian Monroe lit up her screen:

[Boss! Found Vivian Sterling's original painting—"Geese in Late Autumn." Peakrise Auction House. Starting bid: 750K. Move fast.]

Her blood ran cold.

Vivian Sterling—her mother's alias. No death certificate, no body. Just scattered paintings, clues to her disappearance.

Evelyn bolted up. "How much do we have?"

Sebastian replied: [7.5 mil liquid. Rest tied in projects.]

"Enough."

She rushed out, nearly colliding with Margaret in the hall.

"Good morning, ma'am."

Margaret scowled. "Grandma."

"Grandma," Evelyn corrected.

Margaret beamed, dragging her to the dining table. "Eat. I made this for you."

The maids gaped—Margaret never cooked.

Evelyn forced a bite. "Delicious. But I have to go."

"One more!" Margaret insisted, secretly loading her plate with fertility supplements.

Abigail stumbled downstairs, yawning. "Morning, Grandma!"

Margaret's smile vanished. "Apologize to your sister-in-law."

Abigail choked. "What? She dunked my head in a toilet!"

"The maids talk," Margaret snapped. "You started it. Apologize. Now."

Evelyn watched, amused, as Abigail muttered an apology.

"Forgiven." Evelyn stood. "Excuse me, Grandma."

Margaret nodded. "Be safe."

Once Evelyn left, Abigail wailed, "Why take her side?"

"Because she respects me," Margaret said coldly. "And never mention the Rivers family again."

Abigail paled, silenced.

Peakrise Auction House

Sebastian briefed Evelyn as they walked. "Foreign seller. Bidding starts in ten."

Evelyn's pulse raced—until a familiar car pulled up.

Nathaniel.

Why is he here?
###Chapter 17

"Sebastian? Why are we waiting?" Lucas asked impatiently.

Evelyn stood frozen as she watched Nathaniel exit his car and stride confidently into Silver Peaks Auction House. Her brow furrowed. "Someone I'd rather avoid just arrived. Let's give it five minutes."

Sebastian followed her gaze. "Isn't that Nathaniel Grayson? You know him?"

Disgust flashed across Evelyn's face. "Not personally."

The auction hall spanned two levels - ground floor for regular buyers, upper floor with private VIP suites offering complete anonymity, each identified only by numbered doors.

Nathaniel occupied Suite One. Evelyn had been assigned Suite Seven.

After several mediocre artifacts changed hands, the auctioneer presented a set of ancient bronze relics. Starting bid: 1.5 million.

"Two million!"

"Three million!"

"Four million!"

The bidding war concluded when Suite One secured the bronzes for four million, drawing impressed murmurs from the crowd.

Inside Suite Seven, Evelyn exhaled in relief. Nathaniel had clearly come for the bronzes. With his prize secured, he'd likely depart soon.

"Next we have 'Swans at Dusk' by renowned impressionist Vivian Sterling. Opening bid: seven hundred fifty thousand!"

"Eight hundred thousand from Bidder Three!"

"Nine hundred thousand from Eleven!"

"Nine fifty from Five!"

Evelyn nodded sharply at Sebastian.

"One point five million from Suite Seven!"

Gasps rippled through the hall. Who was this mystery bidder?

"Going once... twice..."

Just before the gavel fell, Lucas raised his paddle from Suite One.

"Three million from Suite One!" The auctioneer's voice cracked with excitement.

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her champagne flute. Why was Nathaniel still bidding?

Sebastian scowled. "Is he deliberately provoking us?"

"Counter," Evelyn ordered through gritted teeth.

"Four million from Seven!"

"Five million from One!"

"Six million from Seven!"

"Seven point five million from One! Going once... twice..."

Evelyn's jaw clenched. She couldn't divert company funds for personal matters. "Let him have it," she muttered.

The gavel fell at seven point five million. The crowd buzzed - why pay six times market value for an obscure painting?

Evelyn's mind raced. Her mother had painted under the pseudonym Vivian Sterling. Nathaniel's excessive bid suggested personal connection - but how?

Their contemplation was interrupted by two hostesses bearing refreshments.

"Evelyn Whitmore?" one gasped. "How did you get in here?"

Evelyn recognized Rachel Thornton, her former Alpha Enterprises rival, now working at the auction house.

Rachel's eyes darted to the impeccably dressed Sebastian. Her face twisted with envy. "You got me fired while landing a sugar daddy? Classy!"

Her shrill accusation carried through the hall. Nathaniel, exiting Suite One, froze at the name "Evelyn Whitmore."

Management swiftly removed the shrieking Rachel, but the damage was done. Nathaniel turned toward Suite Seven.

Sebastian was closing their door when Nathaniel appeared. "Is Evelyn here?" His voice could frost glass.

Sebastian feigned confusion. "May I ask why?"

"Tell her to come out." Nathaniel's tone brooked no argument.

Moments later, a young woman in overalls emerged. "Can I help you, sir?"

"You're Evelyn?"

"Corynne with a Y," she chirped.

Nathaniel's interest evaporated. With a curt nod to Sebastian, he departed.

Once Nathaniel was gone, Sebastian handed the actress a platinum card. "Excellent performance. Consider legally changing your name."

Back inside, Evelyn confessed, "I married him last week."

Sebastian choked on his champagne. "Excuse me?"

After hearing the full story, Sebastian smirked. "So... how was the legendary Nathaniel Grayson in bed? I hear older men are very... attentive."

Evelyn's glare promised violence. Sebastian fled to the restroom.

Waiting outside, Evelyn froze when the mirror reflected Nathaniel standing behind her, his expression unreadable.

Sebastian's returning voice cut through the tension. "Boss, why would he want your mother's painting so badly? It's not even that valu—" He froze upon seeing Nathaniel.

Nathaniel's gaze sharpened. "Boss?"
###Chapter 18

Evelyn tilted her head, locking eyes with Sebastian. Years of silent partnership made her subtle hint instantly clear to him.

He cleared his throat, adjusting the Bluetooth earpiece habitually perched on his left ear. With practiced nonchalance, he strode past Nathaniel and Evelyn.

Lowering his voice deliberately, he pretended to be engrossed in a phone call. "Apologies, sir. Situation turned awkward. That Grayson guy overheard my earlier rant about him. Yes, the same one who outbid us for 'Starlight Veil'! Fine, we'll let him have it. Vivian Sterling has other masterpieces we can acquire."

By the time he finished speaking, Sebastian had already put considerable distance between them.

Evelyn blinked innocently at Nathaniel. "He seemed quite upset with you, mister."

Nathaniel's gaze shifted back to her. "You two don't know each other?"

"Never met him before," Evelyn shook her head vigorously. "Do you? Why was he angry with you?"

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed. "You still haven't answered my question. What brings you here?"

Evelyn exhaled dramatically. "Remember how you got me fired from Alpha Enterprises? Heard they were hiring auctioneers here. Came for an interview."

His skepticism remained. "Get the job?"

She shrugged, palms upturned. "No. Required three years' experience. I didn't qualify."

Nathaniel studied her petite frame. If she stood on that auction stage, people might mistake her for selling school supplies.

"And you?" Evelyn peered up. "Why are you here?"

"Grandfather wanted the bronze artifact collection. I'm bidding on his behalf."

"How filial of you," she remarked sweetly.

Nathaniel frowned. That compliment sounded suspiciously like sarcasm.

His phone interrupted them. After a terse conversation, he hung up and fixed Evelyn with an intense stare. "Where to next?"

"Job hunting continues," she replied.

Without warning, his calloused hand patted her head. Leaning down, his gravelly voice brooked no argument. "Come with me. I'll employ you."

"What?" The words barely registered before he'd seized her wrist, whisking her away.

Soon, Evelyn found herself back at Silver Moon Estate - the same place Nathaniel had forced their engagement.

Her eyes darted across the floral arrangements, red carpet, and floating balloons. Panic drained her complexion. "What now, uncle? Another wedding?"

Nathaniel smirked. "That eager to marry me again?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes hard, ready to bolt when a feminine voice chirped, "Uncle!"

A young woman in a wedding gown hurried toward them. "Did you find someone?" she asked anxiously.

Nathaniel propelled Evelyn forward. "What about her?"

The bride-to-be blinked at Evelyn, who crossed her arms defensively. "What's happening?"

The bride pouted. "Did you have to pick someone this gorgeous? I'm supposed to be the center of attention! A prettier bridesmaid will steal my spotlight!"

Nathaniel snorted, glancing at Evelyn. "Beautiful? Might want to get your eyes checked."

The bride gaped.

Evelyn shot Nathaniel a glare, finally understanding the situation.
###Chapter 19

The girl in the wedding dress was Nathaniel's niece, and she desperately needed a last-minute bridesmaid—which was how Evelyn got roped into this.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Are you serious? Bridesmaids are supposed to be single. And since I'm your wife, doesn't that make me her aunt? Since when does an aunt stand as a bridesmaid?"

Nathaniel's lips twitched. Did she just insult my intelligence?

The bride-to-be gasped in delight. "Oh! So you're Aunt Evelyn!"

Evelyn nearly choked. Aunt?

Sophia—Nathaniel's bubbly niece—grabbed Evelyn's hands excitedly. "I'm Sophia Bennett! My bridesmaids are stuck in traffic, and I need someone to fill in. Rules don’t matter right now!"

Evelyn sighed. "Fine."

"Perfect! Let’s get you into a dress!" Sophia dragged her toward the dressing room before Evelyn could protest.

Evelyn shot Nathaniel a glare over her shoulder. This was the "job" he promised?

Nathaniel smirked, thoroughly amused by her irritation.

Dominic appeared beside him, champagne in hand. "Why are you standing here grinning like an idiot?"

Nathaniel shrugged. "No reason."

"Payton’s waiting. Let’s grab a drink."

"Lead the way."

Inside the dressing room, Sophia gestured to four elegant gowns. "Pick whichever you like!"

Evelyn, never one for fuss, grabbed the simplest one.

"This one works."

Sophia beamed. "Great! Change quickly—I’ll check if the others arrived!"

Once alone, Evelyn slipped into the sky-blue dress. The delicate ruffles gave her an ethereal glow. As she waited, she checked her phone—Sebastian had sent multiple messages.

The door swung open abruptly.

Evelyn looked up—it wasn’t Sophia.

A man stood frozen, staring at her. "Who—?"

Sophia burst in just then. "Adrian! What are you doing here?"

Adrian—Sophia’s fiancé—smiled warmly. "Just checking on you. Everything ready?"

"Of course!" Sophia pulled Evelyn forward. "This is my aunt’s replacement bridesmaid! Gorgeous, right?"

Adrian extended a hand. "Nice to meet you. We appreciate the help."

Evelyn shook it politely, though something about him felt oddly familiar.

His grip tightened unexpectedly. Then—subtly—his thumb brushed her palm.

Evelyn stiffened.

What the hell was that?
###Chapter 20

"You should go greet the guests, Adrian! I've got everything under control with the bridesmaids, so stop fussing!" Sophia Bennett playfully shoved her fiancé out of the bridal suite.

Turning back, she beamed at Evelyn Whitmore who had just changed into her bridesmaid dress. "You look absolutely stunning, Evelyn! No wonder Uncle Nathaniel finally decided to give up his bachelor life!"

Evelyn's lips curved into a wry smile. "Since I'm your bridesmaid today, just call me Evelyn. No need for formalities."

Sophia nodded eagerly. "Alright, Evelyn! So tell me, how did you and my uncle meet?"

'How did we meet? Let me sum it up in five words: Worst mistake of my life!'

Evelyn's brows knitted slightly. "That's a story for another day. Today's about you! I want to hear how you and Adrian fell in love."

Sophia needed no further prompting to gush about her romance. Like most brides, she conveniently glossed over all the red flags, painting Adrian as the perfect gentleman.

Soon, two other girls entered the suite - the part-time bridesmaids Sophia had hired.

After helping them into their dresses, Sophia took a phone call and hurried out, asking Evelyn to assist the fourth bridesmaid who was running late.

Minutes later, the door swung open to reveal Rachel Thornton. "Where's my dress?"

Evelyn pointed without looking up from her phone. "Over there."

Rachel's face twisted in disgust when she recognized Evelyn lounging on the sofa. "You? What are you doing here?"

Evelyn glanced up calmly. "Being a bridesmaid. And saving a wedding."

After losing her auction house job with mounting credit card debt, Rachel had jumped at this $300/day bridesmaid gig. Finding Evelyn here was an unpleasant surprise.

She sneered at Evelyn's dress. "What happened to your sugar daddy from this morning? Got dumped already? Serves you right!"

Evelyn ignored the taunts, scrolling through her phone.

Rachel took the silence as confirmation and smirked triumphantly. "Did you really think those rich men would take you seriously? You're just a plaything to them!"

When Evelyn continued ignoring her, Rachel huffed and went to change. Her face fell when she saw the plain dress remaining.

Spotting Evelyn's more elaborate gown, she marched over. "Switch dresses with me."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Why should I?"

"Because you got me fired twice! You owe me!"

A cold smile played on Evelyn's lips. "Funny, I recall someone getting me fired first."

Rachel reached for the dress. "Stop whining. Just give it to me!"

Evelyn clenched her fists but stopped herself. Today was Sophia's big day - finding four bridesmaids hadn't been easy. The ceremony would start soon.

"Fine. We'll switch."

After changing, Rachel preened before the mirror - until she saw Evelyn emerge yawning in the simpler dress.

Somehow, Evelyn still looked breathtaking. The dress didn't make her beautiful - she elevated the dress to new heights just by wearing it.
###Chapter 21

"Damn it!" Rachel cursed under her breath, her face twisted with envy.

Evelyn had no intention of engaging in a petty argument at someone else’s wedding. She turned away and headed toward the restroom.

When she stepped back out, her gaze inadvertently caught movement at the end of the hallway. A man and a woman were whispering, their heads close together. Moments later, they slipped into a storage room.

If her eyes weren’t playing tricks on her, that man was none other than Sophia’s groom, Adrian. And the woman? Rachel—wearing the same blue bridesmaid dress as Evelyn.

What exactly was a groom doing with a bridesmaid on his wedding day?

Inside the storage room, the air was thick with tension.

"You’re a heartless bastard, Adrian! How could you marry someone else behind my back?"

Rachel’s voice was sharp, laced with betrayal.

Adrian sighed, running a hand through his hair. "What are you even doing here, Rachel?"

"I’m one of the bridesmaids! I had no idea the groom would be you! No wonder you’ve been ghosting me!"

He pulled out a card from his pocket and shoved it toward her. "There’s thirty thousand in here. Consider it our breakup fee. Once the wedding’s over, leave quietly. Don’t make a scene."

Rachel snatched the card, scoffing. "Thirty thousand? You think that’s enough? If you want to end this, you’re giving me at least a hundred and fifty grand!"

Adrian’s patience snapped. "You’re pushing your luck. Take the thirty or get nothing. And if you cause trouble, I’ll have security drag you out."

Evelyn lingered outside, listening to the heated exchange. Suddenly, it clicked why Adrian had seemed familiar.

He’d once picked Rachel up from Silver Peaks Enterprises. Rachel, ever the show-off, had paraded him around the office, flaunting her "handsome boyfriend."

Yet Sophia had claimed she and Adrian had been together for three years, deeply in love.

Beneath that charming facade was just another cheater. Poor Sophia had no idea.

Evelyn’s expression remained blank as she turned away.

Sophia was Nathaniel’s niece. This wasn’t Evelyn’s business to interfere.

The ceremony began with the soft, romantic notes of the Wedding March.

Sophia glided down the aisle, radiant in her gown, her eyes fixed on the man she believed would be her forever.

In the audience, Dominic nudged Nathaniel with a smirk. "Where’s that wife of yours? Didn’t bring her along?"

Nathaniel didn’t answer. His gaze was locked on the stage—specifically, on Evelyn in her blue bridesmaid dress.

Lucas leaned in. "She’s here, Mister Prescott."

Dominic scanned the crowd. "Where? I don’t see her."

Lucas pointed toward the stage. "Up there."

Dominic squinted. Aside from the bride, there were only four bridesmaids. "Which one?"

He’d only ever seen Evelyn either caked in makeup or veiled.

The large screen above the stage displayed sweet moments of Sophia and Adrian’s relationship. The officiant was mid-sentence, asking Sophia to recite her vows—

Then, without warning, the screen flickered.

The romantic montage vanished, replaced by grainy surveillance footage.

Adrian, dragging a bridesmaid into a storage room.

The entire venue erupted into chaos.
###Chapter 22

Adrian's face drained of color as he stared at Rachel, who sat among the four bridesmaids.

"That scheming witch!"

Sophia's radiant smile froze as she gaped at Adrian in shock. "What's your relationship with her? And what exactly happened in that storage room?"

Adrian grasped Sophia's shoulders gently. "Please, let me explain. That girl in the video claimed she felt dizzy and asked me to help her rest. The moment we entered, she started undressing and throwing herself at me!"

"I was horrified! I pushed her away immediately and left. I swear on my life, nothing happened!"

Sophia wasn't convinced. She shoved Adrian aside and marched toward the bridesmaids. "Which one of you is the slut in that video? Step forward!"

Rachel reached behind her and gave Evelyn a forceful shove, sending the drowsy girl stumbling toward Sophia.

Sophia's brows knitted in confusion. "You?"

Below the stage, Dominic smirked, nudging Nathaniel. "Your little wildcat strikes again! Who knew she'd go after another woman's fiancé—especially your niece's man? And here I thought she only had eyes for you."

Nathaniel remained impassive, though his piercing gaze sharpened.

Evelyn blinked slowly, still shaking off sleep. She gestured toward the screen. "Look at the skirt. Mine doesn't have ruffles."

Rachel's eyes dropped to her own ruffled dress. Damn it!

She quickly pointed at Evelyn. "It's her! She's the one who seduced Adrian! She was wearing my dress earlier but insisted we switch after using the restroom. Now I know why—she planned to frame me!"

Sophia and Evelyn locked eyes.

"But I distinctly remember you wearing the ruffled dress first," Sophia challenged.

Rachel stepped forward aggressively. "Exactly! If you're innocent, why demand a dress swap?"

Evelyn tilted her head. "Funny, I recall you begging me to trade."

"Prove it!" Rachel snapped. "No evidence means you're lying."

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "Isn't the video evidence enough?"

Rachel glanced at the grainy footage where the woman's face remained blurred. "That proves nothing!"

Evelyn turned toward the sound booth. "Turn up the volume. The truth's in the audio."

The speakers crackled to life, amplifying every damning word between Adrian and Rachel. Their heated exchange laid bare their illicit affair for all to hear.

Sophia's face twisted in betrayal. "You lying tramp!" Her palm connected with Rachel's cheek in a resounding slap.

Rachel clutched her stinging face, trembling. The crystal-clear audio had betrayed her.

She'd arranged the surveillance playback herself—but how had the sound been restored? She'd made sure it was muted earlier.
###Chapter 23

Evelyn wanted payback against Adrian for only offering her 30,000 dors to end their fling.

If she could make Victoria suffer for costing her the job, it would solve two problems at once.

Victoria's reputation would be ruined beyond repair, making her unmarriageable to any respectable man.

But the plan backfired spectacularly when the supposedly silent video played with crystal clear audio!

Adrian grabbed Sophia's arm in panic. "Listen to me, I swear she means nothing to me!"

"Don't touch me!" Sophia shoved him away in disgust. "I can't believe I almost married someone like you!"

Gathering her wedding dress, she fled the venue without looking back.

Adrian shot Rachel a murderous glare before chasing after his runaway bride.

The guests' condemning whispers forced Rachel to slink offstage in humiliation.

She'd seduced the groom at her best friend's wedding, extorted money from him, then tried framing someone else. The sheer audacity!

If rotten tomatoes had been available, the crowd would've pelted her without hesitation.

Evelyn stifled a yawn, craving nothing more than her pillow. When she glanced down, she caught Nathaniel watching her with unsettling amusement.

'Why's he looking at me like that?'

As Evelyn stepped down, Lucas approached the microphone with grave authority.

"Let me be clear - today's events never happened. If word leaks, the Graysons will hold every single guest accountable. Since we can't trace rumors, we'll target everyone equally."

The threat hung heavy in the air.

"Cough! I didn't see anything."
"Me neither."
"Just here for the food!"
"What a coincidence - same!"

The Bennetts were connected to the Graysons through Nathaniel's mother. Nobody dared cross either family.

Nathaniel stood abruptly, making the crowd flinch.

Evelyn followed at a safe distance, desperate to escape for a nap.

Suddenly Dominic blocked her path with a wolfish grin. "Didn't expect such fire from such a little thing!"

Evelyn blinked at the stranger. 'Who the hell is this guy?'

Outside, they found Adrian groveling before Sophia.

"I'll never look at another woman, I swear! Let's just get through the ceremony first!"

"It's over. No wedding." Sophia's voice cracked with finality.

Adrian's expression darkened when his pleas failed.

Marrying Sophia was his ticket to inheriting the Castillo fortune.

He yanked her close and hissed, "Walk down that aisle or your nudes go viral before sunset."

Sophia recoiled as if struck. The man she'd loved for three years had just threatened to destroy her.
###Chapter 24

"How dare you stoop this low?" Sophia Bennett raised her hand to strike, but Adrian Castillo anticipated the movement and caught her wrist mid-air.

Adrian smirked despite his simmering rage. "Be a good girl and marry me, Sophia. Don't force my hand. You wouldn't like what happens when I'm pushed too far."

"Dream on! I'd rather die than marry scum like you!" Sophia's eyes burned with fury, her disgust for Adrian now undeniable. If only she could wipe that smug look off his face with her fists.

But his grip was ironclad, leaving her trapped and helpless.

Adrian's leer turned predatory. "What if those private photos of yours end up online? Imagine the scandal—"

A sharp crack echoed through the hallway as Evelyn Whitmore's fist connected with Adrian's jaw, sending him crashing into a decorative vase display.

"Disgusting pig," Evelyn muttered, shaking out her hand.

Sophia gaped.

Adrian blinked stars from his vision before focusing on the petite bridesmaid who'd decked him. "You little—"

"Let me guess," Evelyn cut in, tilting her head. "You're the type who 'accidentally' brushes against women during handshakes? And now you're blackmailing your girlfriend of three years with revenge porn? Classy."

"Stay out of this, bitch!" Adrian swung wildly, but Evelyn caught his arm mid-motion and twisted—hard.

The sickening pop of his shoulder dislocating was followed by his scream.

Sophia snapped out of her shock and delivered a vicious kick to Adrian's ribs. "That's for wasting three years of my life, you parasite!"

Evelyn yawned, maintaining her hold so Sophia could use Adrian as her personal punching bag.

Across the hall, Nathaniel Grayson observed with detached interest, hands in his tailored trousers. Dominic Prescott whistled low beside him. "Damn, your wife's got skills. Starting to worry about your safety, man."

Nathaniel shot him a withering glare.

"Enough," Nathaniel commanded, his voice cutting through Sophia's rage.

Sophia froze, tears streaking her mascara. "Uncle! He cheated and threatened to—"

Evelyn decided they'd made their point and released Adrian, stretching her back. The man's face was a canvas of bruises and scratches.

Then chaos erupted.

Adrian lunged for a hallway vase and hurled it at Evelyn with a roar. "Meddling whore!"

Nathaniel moved like lightning. One moment he was across the corridor—the next, he'd yanked Evelyn behind him and delivered a brutal kick to Adrian's chest.

Italian leather met ribcage with a sickening thud. Nathaniel looked down at the wheezing man with icy disdain. "Seeking an early grave?"

Adrian paled. "Mr. Grayson, I—"

Dominic strolled over, shaking his head. "Trying to bankrupt your family? Bold move, attacking Nathaniel's woman."

Adrian's blood ran cold. 'His woman?'

He'd known better than to lay hands on Sophia—Nathaniel's niece—but this random bridesmaid? "I-I just love Sophia too much to let her go!"

Nathaniel's gaze turned arctic. "Love? Is that what you call blackmail?"

Dominic snorted. "Or is it about losing access to the Bennett trust fund?"

Adrian's mouth opened and closed like a fish.

Sophia collapsed into her uncle's arms, sobbing. The truth was undeniable—she'd been nothing but a stepping stone to Adrian.
###Chapter 25

Nathaniel helped Sophia up and gestured coldly. "Get him out of here. I won't have Silver Moon Estate's halls stained with filth like him!"

"Right away, sir!" Lucas signaled for security to drag Adrian away.

As Nathaniel cradled his sobbing niece, his sharp gaze flicked to Evelyn. His voice was stern, almost paternal. "Are you hurt?"

Evelyn shook her head dismissively. "I'm fine. Thanks for asking."

From the shadows of the corridor, Rachel watched everything unfold. A man like Nathaniel—powerful, wealthy, devastatingly handsome—was everything she dreamed of. What she didn't dream of was Evelyn being the one he swooped in to save like some fairytale prince.

To Rachel, Evelyn was nothing but an opportunist, always finding ways to flaunt herself in front of rich men. She couldn't let her win.

Gritting her teeth, Rachel burst forward with crocodile tears. "Miss Sophia, I was set up! Don't let Evelyn fool you!"

Sophia turned, wiping her tears with a furious swipe. "Oh, I was going to forget about you, but since you're here—you snake!"

Rachel didn’t flinch. Instead, she pointed dramatically at Evelyn. "It wasn’t me! It was her! The video was edited! She’s some tech genius—she framed me!"

Sophia marched up to Rachel, eyes blazing. "How dare you accuse her? Do you even know who she is to me?"

"W-Who... is she?" Rachel stammered, still convinced Evelyn was just a lowly bridesmaid.

Sophia kicked Rachel’s shin before snapping, "As if Evelyn would ever stoop to someone like Adrian! She’s my—"

"Best friend! We’re best friends!" Evelyn cut in quickly. The last thing she needed was rumors about her three-month arrangement with Nathaniel spreading.

"Exactly!" Sophia crossed her arms. "Lucas, make sure no one in this city hires this backstabbing witch unless they want the Graysons and the Bennetts as enemies!"

Lucas nodded. "Consider it done, Miss Sophia."

Rachel paled, desperation clawing at her. "Please, forgive me! Evelyn, you know I didn’t mean it—say something!"

Before Evelyn could respond, Sophia yanked her away. "Ignore her. She’s not worth another second."

Rachel lunged toward Nathaniel instead. "Mr. Grayson! Please, have mercy!"

Nathaniel didn’t even glance her way. Expressionless, he strode past her, Dominic following silently behind.

Rachel stood frozen, fists clenched. How the hell did Evelyn get close to someone like Sophia? And why did Nathaniel save her?!

Just then, Adrian staggered back, bruised and furious. The moment he spotted Rachel, he lunged. "You ruined me, you bitch!"

Rachel shrieked as he tackled her, rifling through her purse. He snatched back the "breakup fee" card she’d swindled from him.

"That’s mine!" she screeched, clawing for it.

"You cost me my inheritance and my future!" Adrian spat in her face. "Rot in hell!"

Back in the Grayson car, Nathaniel reclined, scanning documents. His voice was calm but probing. "Was it you?"

Evelyn, half-asleep, blinked. "Hm?"

"The surveillance footage on the screen," he clarified, watching her closely.
###Chapter 26

Evelyn maintained an indifferent expression. "Yes, and no."

Nathaniel continued flipping through his documents without looking up. "So which is it?"

"Rachel was the one who posted the video, but I recorded their conversation and edited the subtitles," Evelyn admitted honestly.

Nathaniel let out a dry chuckle. "I brought you here as a bridesmaid, yet you single-handedly destroyed the bride's wedding. How do you plan to explain this?"

Evelyn's brows knitted together. "Honestly, I know better than to interfere with your family matters. But scumbags like Adrian deserve to be exposed. It's practically my civic duty."

The corner of Nathaniel's mouth twitched. "I never pegged you for a self-appointed vigilante."

Indignation burned in Evelyn's chest. "That bastard Adrian cheated on Sophia and even tried to grope me when we shook hands earlier. His disgusting behavior speaks volumes about his character! Surely you don't want your niece marrying trash like that?"

Nathaniel's gaze sharpened. "He groped you?"

"Yes! A pervert like him would never treat Sophia right!"

"Explain exactly what happened."

Evelyn huffed, frustrated he'd missed the point. "He pretended to shake hands politely but deliberately stroked my palm with his finger."

Nathaniel's dark eyes turned stormy, his jaw tightening as he fell silent.

When they arrived at Silver Moon Estate, Evelyn exited the car alone. Nathaniel appeared buried in work, so she didn't wait, assuming he wouldn't be getting out.

Lucas called after her. "Miss Evelyn! Wait a moment!"

She turned. "Yes?"

Lucas retrieved a carefully wrapped painting from the trunk. "Mr. Grayson won this at auction as thanks for saving his grandmother yesterday."

An auction painting? Realization struck. With trembling fingers, Evelyn peeled back the wrapping paper. Just as she suspected - 'Geese in Late Autumn'!

Nathaniel had bought her mother's painting as a thank you gift? If she'd known, she would've let Sebastian drive the bid higher at the auction!

Evelyn marched back to Nathaniel's window and knocked. The tinted glass lowered to reveal his sharp profile, though he didn't look up.

"Get out. We need to talk," she demanded.

Nathaniel kept reading.

"It's important!" she insisted.

Finally, he turned, noting her unusually bright expression. Curiosity flickered as he closed his file and stepped out. "Speak."

Without warning, Evelyn pushed him against the wall and threw her arms around him. "Hold my head!" she ordered.

Nathaniel's brows furrowed dangerously. "Excuse me?"

Evelyn blinked up at him, ignoring his question. "Do it now!"

"Three seconds to release me," he warned.

Undeterred, Evelyn rose on her toes and boldly looped her arms around his neck.

Nathaniel's gaze darkened as her floral scent enveloped him.

"Your grandmother's watching from upstairs," Evelyn whispered urgently. "Make it convincing!"

A subtle glance confirmed Margaret's spying from a second-floor window.

Evelyn began exaggeratedly bobbing her head in a terrible imitation of kissing.

Amused despite himself, Nathaniel cupped the back of her head firmly, tilting his face to match her rhythm while maintaining careful distance.

Their eyes locked in the charged space between them. Breathing shallowed. Heartbeats quickened.

Lucas spun around abruptly, suddenly very interested in the clouds overhead.
###Chapter 27

The moment their lips parted, Evelyn shoved Nathaniel away with surprising force.

She snatched the painting from Lucas's hands and clutched it protectively to her chest. After taking two deliberate steps, she spun around and flashed him a mischievous wink. "Thanks, uncle! You're looking exceptionally dashing today!"

Nathaniel's expression darkened as his lips pressed into a thin line. 'Did this little opportunist just compliment my appearance only after getting what she wanted?'

Lucas watched Evelyn skip happily toward the manor, an involuntary smile tugging at his lips. "She's actually... kind of adorable."

A glacial glare from Nathaniel made Lucas immediately avert his eyes. "Ahem! Where to next, sir?"

"The office."

"Office it is!"

The following afternoon, Evelyn was enjoying the lavish lunch Margaret had prepared when her phone rang.

"Evelyn!"

Though she hadn't saved the number, Evelyn recognized Sophia Bennett's voice instantly. "How did you get my number?"

"Got it from Uncle Nate!"

Evelyn's eyebrows shot up. "And how exactly did he have my number?"

"Well, he's your husband! Shouldn't he have his wife's number?"

"Oh. Right."

"What are your plans today? Come have drinks with me if you're free!"

Evelyn frowned. "Who drinks in the afternoon?"

"I'm nursing a broken heart!" Sophia's words slurred suspiciously. "Don't make me drink alone - it's depressing!"

The call ended abruptly, followed immediately by a text with a bar address.

Margaret emerged from the kitchen carrying soup. "Who was that inviting you for drinks? You should avoid alcohol while preparing for pregnancy!"

Evelyn responded obediently, "Don't worry, Grandma. I don't drink. Sophia's had too much already - I should check on her."

Margaret nearly dropped the soup. "Sophia? Nathaniel introduced you to the Bennetts already?"

Evelyn nodded. "Yes. Is that unusual?"

The older woman recovered quickly with a warm smile. "Not at all. Bars can be unsafe - I'll have the driver take you."

"Thanks!" Evelyn noted the strange dynamic between the Graysons and Bennetts. Though connected through Nathaniel, their interactions seemed minimal. The Graysons hadn't attended Sophia's wedding, nor had the Bennetts come to her own sham ceremony.

She dismissed the thought. Nathaniel's family affairs weren't her concern.

The Starlight Lounge pulsed with energy, strobe lights cutting through the haze. Evelyn spotted Sophia immediately - her newly dyed electric pink hair stood out as she danced wildly. 'Is this how all heartbroken women behave?' Evelyn wondered.

"Evelyn! You came! Dance with me!" Sophia spotted her, threw her arms around Evelyn's neck, and dragged her toward the dance floor.

"Let's get you home instead," Evelyn insisted.

Sophia pouted. "Home's boring! I'm staying!"

Relenting, Evelyn guided her to a quiet booth, ordering juice while Sophia demanded something stronger. "I've got news! Adrian's arms are destroyed!"

Evelyn's eyebrow arched. "What happened?"

Sophia's bitter smile held complex emotions. "He got ambushed last night. Both arms shattered beyond repair. Can you imagine? A man like him, helpless? He might as well be dead!"

"Ambushed?" Evelyn echoed.

Suddenly Sophia gasped, pointing upstairs. "Wait - isn't that Uncle Nate? Who's that woman with him? Ugh! Even he's cheating? All men are trash! Let's go confront them!"
###Chapter 28

Sophia Bennett's finger shot toward the second-floor corridor. "Look! Over there!"

Evelyn Whitmore followed the direction and spotted Nathaniel Grayson's tall, imposing figure walking alongside a stunning woman with cascading curls and legs that seemed to stretch for miles.

She averted her gaze, her expression unreadable. "Not interested."

Sophia gaped. "You're seriously just going to ignore the fact that your husband is sneaking around with another woman?"

Evelyn took a slow sip of her juice. "Yep."

Still reeling from her own recent heartbreak, Sophia's temper flared. The alcohol in her system only fueled her outrage.

"No way! If you won't confront him, I will!" She slammed her glass down and stormed off before Evelyn could stop her.

Evelyn sighed but didn’t bother chasing after her. Nathaniel wouldn’t harm his own niece, and frankly, she couldn’t care less about his personal affairs. Their marriage was nothing more than a business arrangement.

Leaning back in the booth, Evelyn let her eyelids grow heavy. The bar’s dim lighting and steady hum of chatter made it easy to drift off. If not for Sophia’s frantic call earlier, she’d still be napping after lunch.

A familiar voice snapped her out of her drowsiness. "You could’ve told me you were coming!"

Sebastian Monroe slid into the seat beside her, grinning. "I only found out because the manager recognized you."

Evelyn gave him a lazy glance. "I’m just here to pick someone up. Not staying long."

Sebastian raised a brow. "Who?"

"A niece."

"A what? Since when do you have a niece?"

She ignored the question. "Shouldn’t you be at work?"

He uncapped a water bottle and handed it to her. "Networking is work. Besides, the company’s fine without me."

Evelyn took a sip. "You network every single day."

Sebastian smirked, knowing she wouldn’t push further. "By the way, Grayson still doesn’t suspect we know each other, right?"

"Nope. Clueless as ever."

"Perfect. Shame about the painting, though—"

"It’s with me."

Sebastian’s eyes widened. "Already? How?"

"He gave it to me."

"Just like that? No strings attached?"

Evelyn shrugged. "He owed me a favor."

Sebastian scoffed. "Yeah, right. That man’s got ulterior motives. Probably trying to win you over."

She rolled her eyes. "Get out of here. Don’t you have people to schmooze?"

Laughing, Sebastian stood and left, but not before ordering a fruit platter and hot milk for her.

Alone again, Evelyn closed her eyes, letting the neon lights blur behind her lids.

Then—

A smooth voice interrupted her peace. "Mind if I join you?"
###Chapter 29

The deep baritone voice cut through the pounding music, reaching Evelyn Whitmore's ears.

She had just closed her eyes when the stranger addressed her.

Her brows furrowed in irritation as she opened them. Standing under the dim bar lights was a strikingly handsome man with an easy smile.

He wore tailored black slacks and a crisp white shirt with two buttons undone, revealing just enough collarbone to be intentional.

There was a careless elegance about him that radiated undeniable charm.

When she didn't respond, his smile widened. "Are you here alone?"

Evelyn took a slow sip of her milk before answering. "No."

The man's smile remained polished. "Mind if I join you?"

She didn't even blink. "Actually, I do."

For a split second, his confident expression faltered - clearly unaccustomed to rejection. But he recovered quickly. "How old are you? You look young to be here."

Evelyn gave him a deadpan look. "Are you the fashion police?"

His mouth actually dropped open this time.

She continued dryly, "Then why the interrogation? Taking a census? My mother warned me about strangers."

The man burst out laughing. "You're sitting alone in a place like this. I was concerned for your safety."

Evelyn took another sip of milk. "I'd be safer if you walked away."

Every word from her mouth seemed to shock the sophisticated gentleman, defying all his expectations of women.

His eyes sparkled with newfound interest. "You're fascinating. May I give you my number?"

Just then, Evelyn's phone vibrated - Sophia Bennett calling. She answered immediately, grateful for the excuse to end this conversation.

Sophia's panicked voice came through. "Evelyn! Get up here now!"

"Hard pass," Evelyn replied. "You come down."

"I can't! You need to save me!" Sophia sounded on the verge of tears.

Evelyn's grip tightened on her phone. "What's wrong? Where are you?"

But the line went dead.

Her expression darkened instantly.

The handsome stranger leaned in. "Trouble? Need assistance?"

"Actually, yes." Evelyn stood abruptly.

"Name it," he offered gallantly.

"I need you to move. Now."

Stunned, he stepped aside as she brushed past him toward the elevators. He could only watch her retreating figure with bemused fascination.

"Christopher, what's got you so distracted?" A friend asked, noticing his dazed expression.

Christopher Ashford smiled faintly. "Just met the most intriguing woman. Drinking milk alone at a bar - makes you wonder if she's even legal."

His friend's eyebrows shot up. "First time I've seen you genuinely interested in someone. She must be something special."

Christopher merely smiled, his gaze still fixed on where Evelyn had disappeared.
###Chapter 30

The second floor of Twilight was a sanctuary of soundproofed VIP rooms, a stark contrast to the chaotic bar downstairs. The two levels might as well have existed in separate universes.

Evelyn's call to Sophia went unanswered, leaving her clueless about which room Sophia had entered.

The bar's general manager spotted Evelyn and approached with deference. "Miss Whitmore, are you looking for Mister Monroe?"

Evelyn shook her head. "Did you see which room Sophia Bennett went to?"

The manager hesitated. "I didn't. We haven't had any guests from the Bennetts today."

Sophia must have slipped in unnoticed, likely tailing Nathaniel. Evelyn considered her options. "Which room is Nathaniel in, then?"

"The Snow Room," the manager replied without hesitation.

The Snow Room was Twilight's crown jewel, reserved exclusively for the elite.

Just as Evelyn turned toward the Snow Room, Cassandra's shrill voice cut through the hallway. "I'm here to see someone! Move aside before I make you regret stopping me!"

A flustered host blocked her path. "The Snow Room is for invited guests only. You're not on the list."

Evelyn turned and locked eyes with Cassandra.

Cassandra froze mid-tantrum, her face twisting in disgust. "What are you doing here, Evelyn?" The memory of her impounded car and ill-fitting designer clothes still burned.

Evelyn remained unfazed. "Same as you. Looking for someone."

Cassandra burst into mocking laughter, raking her eyes over Evelyn's outfit. "Who could you possibly know in a place like this? That's the Snow Room up ahead—only the wealthiest get in. Do you really think they'll let someone dressed like a thrift store mannequin waltz in?" She wiped imaginary tears from her eyes. "Pathetic."

Evelyn's clothes were understated but impeccably tailored—luxury without the obnoxious branding.

The manager stepped forward. "Shall we handle this disturbance, miss?"

Cassandra smirked. "Yes, throw this embarrassment out! Twilight is the premier bar in New Capital. You can't let peasants like her drag down your standards!"

The manager ignored her, awaiting Evelyn's cue.

Evelyn waved a dismissive hand. "Follow protocol. I'll check the Snow Room myself."

"Of course." The manager bowed and gestured for her to proceed.

No one stopped Evelyn as she strode down the hall. The door to the Snow Room opened effortlessly beneath her hand.

Cassandra gaped. She tried to follow, but security materialized to block her. "Don't make us escort you out."

Cassandra's jaw dropped. "Why does she get in when I'm turned away? Do you know who I am? I'm Cassandra—star of The Princess Diaries!"

The guard crossed his arms. "Don't care if you're the queen herself. Rules are rules. Leave now or we'll make you."

Defeated, Cassandra hissed, "Who is that woman? Why does your manager kiss her boots?"

"Client confidentiality."

Cassandra seethed, watching Evelyn disappear behind the door. She couldn't fathom how a nobody like Evelyn had this kind of access. Maybe she'd landed a job as some rich man's mistress. Well, Cassandra wasn't leaving until she saw who came out with her.

Her original plan had been to reconnect with her former patron—the one she'd foolishly dumped when she thought she could marry into the Grayson fortune. That decision had cost her career. When her agency refused to renew her contract, she'd learned her ex-benefactor was here tonight. This was her chance to grovel her way back into his good graces.
###Chapter 31

The VIP room was anything but small—it spanned an entire floor, with dim lighting and a live band setting the mood.

Everyone looked glamorous, laughing and clinking glasses in small groups.

Evelyn scanned the crowd for Sophia.

Suddenly, the pink-haired girl came rushing toward her. "Hey there, Au—"

Evelyn pressed a finger to Sophia’s lips, cutting her off. "Just call me by my name when we're outside."

Sophia pouted. "Fine! Evelyn!"

Evelyn frowned, checking her for injuries. "What happened? Why did you call me?"

Sophia clung to her arm nervously and pointed behind her. "It's them! They're bullying me!"

Evelyn turned and saw three well-dressed men smirking at them. Spoiled rich boys, no doubt.

The one on the left scoffed. "Come on, sweetheart. You promised to play with us. Don’t act like we forced you."

The one on the right eyed Evelyn appreciatively. "Well, well. Another beauty. You look innocent—just my type."

Evelyn ignored them and turned to Sophia. "How did you get mixed up with them?"

Sophia lowered her voice guiltily. "I was looking for Uncle Nathaniel, but I couldn’t find him. So I asked them if they knew where he was. They made me play dice—said they’d take me to him if I won. But I lost."

She swallowed hard. "They gave me a choice—drink ten beers or kiss one of them. I wasn’t about to kiss them, and I didn’t trust the drinks either. But they wouldn’t let me leave unless I did one or the other."

Evelyn’s jaw tightened. She turned back to the men. "Proud of yourselves, bullying a girl like this?"

The middle one smirked. "Isn’t gender equality all the rage? If you can’t handle losing, don’t play."

Evelyn’s expression darkened. "You’re playing dice, right? I’ll play."

The third man grinned, eyeing her up. "Oh? You sure about that?"

Evelyn didn’t flinch. "If I win, her debt is cleared."

He raised a brow. "And if I win?"

She met his gaze. "Name your price."

He stepped closer, lowering his voice. "Are you still a virgin?"

Evelyn stiffened, anger flashing in her eyes.

His grin widened. "That reaction says it all." He pulled a hotel key card from his pocket and handed it to her. "I want your first night."

Sophia gasped. "You’re disgusting!"

Evelyn took the card. "Fine. Let’s play."

Sophia grabbed her arm. "No! I’ll drink—don’t do this!"

Meanwhile, in the innermost billiards room of the Snow Room, Benjamin Rivers lounged lazily. "You won’t believe this—I found a hacker called 'Luna Sterling' online. She cracked the AJ League’s encryption like it was nothing. She’s got to be one of the best in the world."

Dominic Prescott lined up his shot. "Your father wants you helping your brother, not messing around with hackers."

Benjamin shrugged. "Why bother? My brother’s got it handled."

Just then, someone burst in. "Guys, you’ve got to see this! There’s a girl outside betting her virginity in a dice game!"

Dominic set down his cue. "Now that’s interesting."

Nathaniel Grayson barely glanced up from the sofa, uninterested—until the messenger added, "Mister Nathaniel, I think your niece Sophia is with her."

Nathaniel’s expression darkened instantly.
###Chapter 32

The man smirked at Evelyn and slid a dice cup toward her. "Wouldn't want you accusing me of cheating. Let's keep it simple - highest roll wins each round. Two out of three wins the game. Fair enough?"

Evelyn gave a firm nod. "Fair."

Sophia's eyes welled up with panic. "Evelyn! This is my mess! I'll drink whatever they want!" She bit her lip, thinking, 'I can't let my aunt gamble with these creeps! If she loses...'

Evelyn squeezed Sophia's trembling hand. "Hush. Trust me."

'Trust her? How?' Sophia desperately wanted to call her uncle, but one of the thugs had already confiscated her phone.

A crowd gathered around them before the game even started, drawn by the spectacle.

Both players held their dice cups. Evelyn's opponent performed an elaborate shake before slamming his down with a cocky grin. "Ladies first?"

Evelyn smiled sweetly. "After you."

"Such manners!" He lifted his cup to reveal four sixes and one five - totaling 29.

The spectators exchanged pitying looks. This young woman clearly didn't stand a chance against seasoned players. Five sixes? Nearly impossible!

Evelyn ignored their skepticism. With practiced ease, she gave her cup a casual shake and flipped it open. Gasps erupted - five perfect sixes stared back.

Her opponent's smile faltered. "Beginner's luck! Next round!"

The second round ended in a tie with both rolling five sixes. The tension thickened as they prepared for the decisive third round.

When the man rolled another perfect set, his confidence returned. "Three perfect rolls in a row? Impossible odds. Looks like we're extending to best of five. I'm already imagining our night together."

"This ends now," Evelyn stated coolly. She shook her cup deliberately for over ten seconds before slamming it down.

The reveal stunned everyone - each die had split cleanly in half, showing six and one. The unprecedented total: 35.

Game over. Evelyn had won.

The three men gaped like fish, leaning in to verify the impossible result. The crowd erupted in astonished murmurs - this young woman had outplayed seasoned gamblers effortlessly.

"We won? We actually won!" Sophia jumped up, stars in her eyes. "Evelyn! You're incredible! My new hero!"

Evelyn covered a delicate yawn. "Let's leave."

From his vantage point on a nearby sofa, Dominic watched with amused admiration. "Your wife never ceases to amaze, Nathaniel!"

Nathaniel lounged regally in his armchair, swirling a glass of red wine. His expression remained unreadable beneath his aristocratic demeanor.

Dominic's comment caught Benjamin's attention. "Wait - that's your wife?" He studied Evelyn with sudden intensity.

The curly-haired woman beside Nathaniel's chair swirled her champagne, casting a disdainful glance toward Evelyn.

Evelyn tossed the room key back at the stunned man and tugged Sophia toward the exit.

"Wait!" Sophia whirled around. "My phone!"

The lead thug, still processing his humiliation, saw an opportunity. "Another game for the phone!"

Evelyn didn't even turn back. "Let it go. Your wealthy uncle will buy you ten new ones."
###Chapter 33

Sophia Bennett hesitated, biting her lip. "But..."

Evelyn Whitmore studied her face and instantly understood. "There's something important on your phone, isn't there?"

Sophia nodded, cheeks flushing with embarrassment.

Evelyn pinched the bridge of her nose and turned to the smug man lounging nearby. "What kind of ridiculous game is this?"

The man smirked, eyeing Evelyn's defiant stance. "Winning or losing doesn't matter here. We spin the wheel. If you play, I return her phone. Simple as that."

Evelyn glanced at the gaudy wheel on the table, unimpressed. "Fine. Let's get this over with."

His grin widened. "Rules are simple—close your eyes, press the button. Whatever option you land on is my punishment. Whatever I land on is yours."

Evelyn's brows furrowed. "Why are we choosing punishments for each other instead of ourselves?"

He shrugged. "Because where's the fun in that?"

She exhaled sharply. "Whatever. Just do it."

He gestured for her to go first.

The wheel spun in a blur of colors. Evelyn shut her eyes and slammed her palm down on the button. When it stopped, the result glared back at her: Kneel and spank yourself 20 times.

Sophia burst into laughter. "Oh, this is perfect! No backing out now!"

The man rolled his eyes but dropped to his knees without protest. With exaggerated theatrics, he delivered twenty sharp smacks to his own backside, earning a few amused glances from nearby patrons.

Now it was his turn.

The wheel whirled again. He watched it for a beat before squeezing his eyes shut and jabbing the button.

Sophia darted forward to read the result—then froze.

French kiss someone you know of the opposite gender for one minute.

Evelyn's jaw tightened.

The man spread his arms, grinning. "My turn to collect. Pay up, sweetheart."

Sophia stepped between them, furious. "Do you have any idea who she is? She's not kissing you! She's my uncle's—"

Evelyn cut her off. "It's fine. I'll handle it."

Sophia grabbed her arm. "Evelyn, he rigged this! Don't let him win! I don't care about the stupid phone!"

Evelyn ignored her, scanning the room. The rule specified someone she knew.

Then Sophia gasped, pointing. "Look! Uncle Nathaniel's right there! Just kiss him!"

Evelyn's gaze landed on Nathaniel Grayson—tall, immaculate, and currently deep in conversation with a stunning woman in a plunging neckline.

Her stomach twisted.

The last time she'd kissed him, she'd ended up trapped in a three-month marriage. Doing it again would only invite more complications.

Her eyes flicked to the charming stranger from earlier, leaning against the bar with an easy smile. His expression practically dared her: Go on. I don’t mind.

Evelyn exhaled.

Better him than Nathaniel.

She took a step forward—toward the stranger.
###Chapter 34

Evelyn had to walk past Nathaniel to reach that gorgeous man across the room. Though she avoided eye contact, she could feel the intensity of his piercing gaze burning into her.

She moved forward without acknowledging him, but suddenly an unseen foot tripped her!

Time seemed to slow as Evelyn lost her balance, tumbling straight into Nathaniel's sculpted chest.

The noisy crowd gasped in unison, the room plunging into stunned silence.

Dominic broke the tension with an exaggerated wolf whistle, sparking hushed whispers among the spectators.

"She actually went for Mister Grayson!"

"Doesn't she know who he is? The audacity!"

"Clearly planned this whole thing!"

"What woman in Silver Peaks wouldn't kill to be in her position right now?"

"Watch how fast he pushes her away. Mister Grayson doesn't tolerate gold-diggers." When Evelyn looked up, her long lashes fluttered against flushed cheeks. "Sir, I—"

Nathaniel arched one perfect eyebrow. "Care to explain yourself?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "This wasn't intentional! You weren't my choice!"

His icy blue eyes narrowed dangerously. "Is that so?"

Evelyn nodded vigorously. "Absolutely! My actual choice is standing right over—"

Before she could finish, the man she'd selected came storming over. "Have you lost your mind? How dare you lay hands on Mister Grayson? Get up before you make him angry!"

Evelyn tried to rise, but Nathaniel's large hand suddenly pressed against the small of her back, pinning her in place.

The usually composed billionaire fixed the younger man with a glacial stare. "And what if I prefer her exactly where she is?"

The man paled visibly. "M-Mister Grayson, I didn't mean—"

Evelyn made a discreet gesture toward her original choice. "See? That's who I meant to pick. Now if you'll just let me go—"

Nathaniel's gaze flicked to the other man, his expression darkening.

The moment Evelyn attempted to move again, a firm push sent her crashing back down.

Their lips collided with enough force to make teeth click.

Before she could process what happened, Nathaniel was kissing her with startling intensity.

Evelyn's eyes flew wide open. Though completely unexpected, she decided to roll with it—Nathaniel Grayson was kissing her after all. She began counting down the required sixty seconds, though her racing heartbeat made keeping time impossible. Heat flooded her entire body.

When the minute finally ended, Evelyn was breathless. She buried her face against Nathaniel's neck, waiting for her blush to fade. This had been her first real kiss, and the public spectacle left her mortified despite the lack of actual feelings involved.

Nathaniel could feel the girl trembling in his arms. His rough fingers absently stroked her hair, as if soothing a skittish kitten.

Then he turned his attention to the stunned game host. "Satisfied? Or shall we play another round? Perhaps you'd like to take my place?"

The man backed away hastily. "N-no sir! Enjoy your... evening!" He turned to flee.

"Wait!" Sophia blocked his path, hands on hips.

The man froze. "Y-yes miss?"

Sophia extended her palm. "My phone. Now."
###Chapter 35

The memory had completely slipped Nathaniel's mind until Sophia mentioned it again. He immediately summoned his assistant to return the phone to her.

With her phone back in hand, Sophia glared at them irritably. "I told you Nathaniel is my uncle. Do you believe me now?"

"Yes! Absolutely! Our deepest apologies for doubting you!"

"We swear we didn't know she was your niece, Mr. Grayson!"

"Please forgive us!"

No one could have guessed the pink-haired intruder was actually Nathaniel's niece. They'd assumed she was just another groupie trying to get close to him.

They were lucky their foolish actions hadn't led to more serious consequences!

The three men gathered before Sophia, bowing deeply to her and Evelyn in apology. "We're truly sorry! Please find it in your hearts to forgive us?"

Sophia jerked her chin toward the Snow Room's exit. "Get out. And don't let me see your faces again."

They scrambled away like prisoners granted a last-minute pardon.

By now, Evelyn had regained her composure. She calmly extricated herself from Nathaniel's lap. "Enjoy your evening. I'll take my leave now."

Sophia rushed after her. "Evelyn! Wait up! I'm coming with you!"

......

As Evelyn and Sophia exited the Snow Room together, Cassandra—who'd been lurking near the restrooms—suddenly blocked their path. "Not so fast, Evelyn! I have questions for you."

Evelyn's mood had already soured. She frowned impatiently. "What?"

Cassandra demanded, "Explain how you got into the Snow Room!"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Is it really that hard?"

Her casual dismissal only fueled Cassandra's anger. 'Of course it is! Even someone of my status can't get in!'

"Well? Are you going to tell me or not?"

"Nothing to tell." Evelyn brushed past her, Sophia in tow.

Sophia glanced back curiously. "Who was that?"

Evelyn answered flatly, "A nuisance."

Cassandra clenched her teeth, snapping a photo of Evelyn walking away with the pink-haired Sophia. "Fine. If you won't talk, Father will make you! Just wait!"

Outside Twilight, a sleek Mercedes-Benz pulled up. The tinted window lowered to reveal Nathaniel's sharp profile. "Get in."

Evelyn frowned but complied without argument.

Sophia moved to follow, but Lucas intercepted her. "Miss Bennett, you're with me. Mr. Grayson's orders—you're grounded until further notice."

"Grounded?" Sophia's face twisted in outrage. "Uncle! Uncle?!"

The Mercedes sped away.

Inside the quiet car, Nathaniel leaned back, massaging his temple. His piercing gaze held the sternness of an overprotective guardian. "You could have called me. Why play the hero?"

Evelyn muttered, "I don't have your number."

He extended his hand. "Phone."

She handed it over without protest.

After programming his contact, he returned it. "Evelyn, remember this—I'll give you anything you ask for. Except my heart. So next time, call."

Evelyn's mind blanked momentarily. She turned, lips curling in a sardonic smile. "Anything except your heart? Does that include what happened earlier too?"
###Chapter 36

Nathaniel's expression remained unreadable. "It wasn't necessary at first, but I won't tolerate any man getting close to my wife during our marriage." His voice was ice. "Walking past me to kiss another man? That will never happen again."

Evelyn scoffed, turning her gaze to the passing cityscape outside the car window. "That’s rich, coming from you. Weren’t you the one publicly dating another woman?"

Nathaniel’s eyes narrowed. "Are you jealous?"

She blinked, lips twitching in disbelief. "Jealous? Us? We’re not even a real couple." Her fingers curled into her palms. "I’m just pissed you kissed me like that—no warning, no nothing. I could barely breathe!"

A smirk tugged at his lips. "If I recall correctly, you didn’t give me a heads-up either when you kissed me the other day."

Evelyn’s cheeks burned. "That was different! Mine was just a peck. I didn’t—"

"Didn’t what?" His tone dripped with amusement.

She clamped her mouth shut, refusing to rise to his bait. "Nothing."

Honestly, she’d rather kiss that mysterious stranger from the bar again—no strings, no complications. But Nathaniel? His influence meant this little stunt would spread like wildfire. Gossip, rumors, unwanted attention—exactly what she didn’t need. Three months. Just three months of keeping her head down, then she’d walk away clean.

Her phone buzzed, shattering her thoughts. Gregory’s name flashed on the screen.

Of course. Cassandra must’ve thrown another tantrum.

She answered, bracing for the storm. His voice crackled through the line, sharp enough to slice steel. "What the hell did you do this time, Evelyn? Get your ass home now and explain yourself!"

She pinched the bridge of her nose. "Not tonight, Dad. I’m exhausted."

"Exhausted from what? Partying? Scandalizing our family name? You’re coming home NOW!"

She hung up, powering off her phone before his next tirade could begin. The car fell silent, save for the faint hum of the engine.

Nathaniel didn’t glance up from his phone, where financial reports glowed on the screen. "Need me to come with you?"

She shook her head. "No. This is my mess. I’ll handle it."

The car pulled up to the Grayson estate. Nathaniel didn’t follow her inside—thankfully. Margaret was home, and the last thing Evelyn needed was another performance of their "perfect marriage."

Upstairs, she booted up her laptop and logged into the game. A private message popped up instantly.

[Ethan Blackwell: (worship emoji) Master! You’re back!]

Ethan—the hacker who’d once crashed Alpha Enterprises’ systems after Rachel scammed him in-game. Ever since Evelyn hacked the AJ League to negotiate with him, he’d been relentless, calling her "Master" despite her protests.

Her fingers flew over the keyboard.

[Jade Rabbit: What do you want?]
###Chapter 37

[Ethan Blackwell: (disappointed emoji) Nothing. I'm pissed today, needed to vent to my master.]

Evelyn Whitmore typed back, [What’s wrong?]

[Ethan Blackwell: (angry emoji) Saw my friend’s rival at Silver Peaks Ranch today. Tried to trip her so she’d eat dirt in front of everyone. But that witch deliberately fell into Nathaniel Grayson’s arms and kissed him! I’m livid!]

Evelyn froze, staring at the screen.

The world really was too small.

That had to be the same guy who’d tripped her—the one with the thick eyebrows and sharp eyes, barely eighteen.

[Maybe it was just the angle? She couldn’t have controlled how she fell.]

[Ethan Blackwell: Hah! No way. That was calculated. She’s a conniving snake!]

Evelyn exhaled, deciding not to engage further. Instead, she logged into the game server, losing herself in matches until her frustration dulled.

After a winning streak, another message popped up.

[Ethan Blackwell: (pleading emoji) Master, are you in New Capital? Let me treat you to dinner!]

Evelyn smirked. [Bad idea. You wouldn’t like what you see.]

[Ethan Blackwell: (confused emoji) Why not? You’re my idol! I’d die to meet you!]

She propped her chin on her palm, amused. Because I’m the "conniving snake" you just cursed out.

A knock interrupted her thoughts.

She closed the game and opened the door to find Margaret Grayson beaming at her, a maid hovering behind with a steaming bowl.

"Try this soup, dear! Made it just for you."

Evelyn had been drowning in the old woman’s culinary experiments lately. Her stomach hadn’t caught a break.

But it was delicious, so she never refused.

"Thank you, Grandma." She stepped aside, letting them in.

Margaret watched her sip the soup with tender pride. "You came back alone? Where’s Sophia?"

"Nathaniel sent Lucas Sinclair to take her home."

The warmth in Margaret’s eyes dimmed. "You saw Nathaniel?"

Evelyn nodded between spoonfuls.

"And he didn’t come back with you?"

"He dropped me off. Probably buried in work."

Margaret huffed. "That boy! What’s the point of having a stunning wife if he’s never home? Work won’t give him grandchildren!"

Evelyn nearly choked.

Margaret was sweet, if not relentlessly fixated on heirs.

The next afternoon, Evelyn returned to the Whitmore estate.

Gregory Whitmore took one look at her and slammed his glass onto the table, shattering it.

"On your knees, you disgraceful girl!"
###Chapter 38

Evelyn carefully stepped over the shattered glass fragments scattered across the floor as she approached Gregory. "What's the matter, Dad? Why are you so upset?"

Cassandra stood nearby with her arms crossed, smirking as she threw gasoline on the fire. "How dare you even ask? You know exactly what you've done."

Evelyn gave Cassandra a bored glance. "I've done many things. Which particular one are you talking about?"

Gregory's face twisted with displeasure. "You told us you moved out because you got a job. What kind of job is this?" His voice dripped with barely contained fury.

Evelyn hesitated, struggling to find the right words. How exactly does one describe 'pretending to be the wife of a powerful CEO to pacify his family'? Would 'professional actress' or 'temporary spouse' sound more appropriate?

Seeing her hesitation, Gregory's anger flared. "Still keeping secrets from me? A prestigious university student like you, working as a nightclub hostess? Have you no shame, Evelyn? Is this your way of getting back at me?"

Evelyn's eyebrows shot up. "Hostess?"

Gregory slammed a photo onto the table. It showed Evelyn walking out of The Starlight Lounge with Sophia the previous evening. Sophia's newly dyed pink hair and revealing outfit, combined with her unsteady drunken gait, made her look exactly like someone from that profession. Naturally, anyone seeing them together would assume they worked in the same industry.

Evelyn studied the photo, then turned to Cassandra with a knowing look. "You're the one who showed this to Dad, aren't you?"

Cassandra lifted her chin defiantly, her expression screaming 'So what if I did?'

Victoria chose that moment to chime in, her voice dripping with false concern. "Don't blame your sister, Evelyn. She's only trying to help you return to the right path! That kind of work might pay well, but it's degrading! Honestly, how could you—"

Evelyn cut her off with a humorless smile. "Help me? She should worry about herself first."

Cassandra's eyes flashed with irritation. "What's that supposed to mean? I'm not the one working in a nightclub!"

Ignoring her, Evelyn turned back to Gregory. "The girl in the photo is my landlord's niece."

Gregory looked momentarily stunned. "Is that true?"

Evelyn met his gaze steadily. "Yes."

Cassandra scoffed loudly. "Liar! The Starlight Lounge is exclusive to VIP members only. How could you possibly get in unless you worked there? Explain that!"

Evelyn's lips curved into a calm smile. "Simple. My landlord happens to be one of their elite members."

Cassandra's frown deepened as she recalled following Evelyn to that massive estate days earlier. The pieces were starting to fall into place.
###Chapter 39

Evelyn was stunned. "Trending searches? How am I trending when I haven't booked any roles lately? And I'm number one?"

She'd never topped the charts before, not even during that infamous wardrobe malfunction incident.

"What's happening?" A sinking feeling gripped Evelyn's chest as she fumbled for her phone. True enough, her name dominated the search rankings with the damning headline: "EXPOSED: The Sugar Daddy Behind Actress Evelyn Whitmore!"

Her fingers shook violently as she tapped the link. The article featured a compromising video of entertainment industry heavyweights at a private dinner. A looping GIF showed her perched on a bald man's lap.

"Who leaked these? Who's trying to ruin me?" Evelyn's voice cracked.

Going viral meant global humiliation. Gregory's face burned with shame as he glared at his daughter. "You disgraceful little tramp! Look at your disgusting behavior!"

Evelyn turned ghostly pale, shaking her head frantically. "It's not what it looks like, I—"

"Save your lies!" Gregory spat. "I saw you sitting on that old pervert's lap! How could I raise such a shameless—"

"But Dad, we were discussing work—"

"Work?" Gregory snatched a decorative vase from the table and hurled it at her. "Since when does discussing work require sitting on men's laps?"

The porcelain shattered at Evelyn's feet. She froze like a cornered animal.

"Calm down, Father." Cassandra handed him a glass of water, her voice dripping with false concern. "Poor Evelyn probably had no choice. Those predators took advantage of her desperation to bring honor to our family."

"Honor?" Gregory roared. "She's brought nothing but shame! Now the whole world sees my daughter behaving like a common—"

Comparing his two daughters put things in perspective. Gregory once thought Cassandra working as a maid was embarrassing. Now Evelyn's scandal made that seem virtuous by comparison.

Evelyn couldn't retaliate against her father, but she rounded on Cassandra. "You scheming witch! This is your doing, isn't it? Ever since you came back—"

Gregory's slap echoed through the foyer.

"How dare you blame your sister? She earns an honest living while you whore yourself out! You're the disgrace here!" He raised his hand again. "I'll beat some decency into you!"

Evelyn collapsed, sobbing.

"Stop crying, you shameless—"

"Enough!" Victoria rushed between them. "She must have had reasons!"

"Reasons?" Gregory sneered. "The only reason is her hunger for fame! You've both disgraced the Whitmore name! Neither of you will leave this house until further notice!"

He stormed upstairs, leaving Evelyn weeping in her mother's arms.

"Mom, how did this happen?" Evelyn whimpered. "That video was private! I can't face anyone now!"
###Chapter 40

Victoria Blackwood pulled her daughter Cassandra into a tight embrace. "Don't cry, darling. I'll fix this. I swear I'll clear your name!"

Evelyn Whitmore stood nearby, arms crossed, lips curled in amusement. The sight of Victoria and Cassandra in such distress only made her chuckle softly.

Cassandra's tears stopped the moment she heard that laugh. Her face twisted with fury as she whirled on Evelyn. "This is your doing! You did this to me, Evelyn!"

Evelyn arched a brow, feigning innocence. "Me? A mere maid couldn’t possibly afford a front-page scandal. That kind of exposure costs a fortune."

Money hadn’t been necessary—just the right skills.

Cassandra glared. "Even if you didn’t pay for it, you made sure Dad saw it! You came here just to twist the knife!"

Evelyn sighed. "Funny. Wasn’t it you who insisted I come home today?"

Cassandra’s mouth snapped shut.

"Besides," Evelyn continued, "he would’ve found out eventually. If you didn’t want the world to know about your little scandals, maybe you shouldn’t have done them in the first place."

Cassandra trembled with rage, too furious to speak, her face streaked with tears.

Victoria couldn’t stand it any longer. The mask of kindness slipped. "Enough! Who do you think you are? Some illegitimate brat playing the perfect daughter in front of your father!"

Evelyn smirked. "You don’t know me. But I know exactly what kind of people you two are."

She leaned in slightly, voice dropping to a whisper. "And this? This is just karma paying you back for every rotten thing you’ve ever done."

Without another word, she turned and headed upstairs to find Gregory. There were things she needed to discuss with him—alone.

Victoria watched her go, teeth clenched. That little witch. She won’t get away with this.

Her attempts to drive Evelyn out of the Whitmore estate had failed time and again. The Whitmores weren’t the wealthiest family, but their ancestors had left them prime real estate—enough to live comfortably off the rents.

Victoria refused to let an illegitimate child like Evelyn claim a single penny of it.

Her original plan had been simple: marry Evelyn off, ensuring she’d take her husband’s name and forfeit any inheritance rights. But every blind date she arranged had ended in disaster.

Now, she needed a new strategy—fast. Because as long as Evelyn stayed, she’d keep bringing them misery.

Gregory was still fuming in his study when a soft knock interrupted his thoughts. "Get out!" he snapped.

"Dad, it’s me," Evelyn called gently.

His anger cooled slightly. "Evelyn? Come in."

The door opened, and Evelyn stepped inside, a painting tucked under her arm.
###Chapter 41

Victoria Blackwood comforted her daughter Cassandra. "Don't cry, darling. I'll fix this. Your reputation will be spotless again!"

Evelyn Whitmore stood nearby, arms crossed. A smirk played on her lips as she watched the mother-daughter duo unravel.

Cassandra's tears stopped instantly when she heard Evelyn's quiet chuckle. Her face twisted in rage as she pointed an accusing finger. "This is your doing, Evelyn! You set me up!"

Evelyn raised an eyebrow, feigning innocence. "Me? A simple assistant couldn't possibly afford front-page headlines. Those cost a fortune."

Money hadn't been necessary—just certain specialized skills.

Cassandra glared. "Even if you didn't pay for the coverage, you made sure Dad saw it! You orchestrated this!"

Evelyn tilted her head. "Wasn't it you who demanded I come home today? Funny how that backfired."

Cassandra's mouth opened, then shut.

"Besides," Evelyn continued, "he would've found out eventually. Pro tip: if you don't want scandals, maybe don't create them."

Cassandra's face flushed crimson. She dissolved into angry sobs.

Victoria could no longer maintain her composed facade. "Enough! You're no saint yourself, Evelyn. Just a bastard playing the perfect daughter!"

Evelyn's smile turned icy. "I know exactly what kind of snakes you two are. And this?" She gestured to Cassandra's distress. "Karma's a beautiful thing."

Without another word, Evelyn turned toward the study. She had private matters to discuss with Gregory.

Victoria's nails dug into her palms as she watched Evelyn walk away. This little witch will pay for humiliating us.

Her attempts to remove Evelyn from the Whitmore estate had repeatedly failed. Though not extravagantly wealthy, the family owned substantial property holdings—enough to live comfortably off rental income indefinitely.

Victoria refused to let an illegitimate child claim any part of that inheritance.

Her original plan—marrying Evelyn off to sever her legal ties—had collapsed spectacularly. Every arranged meeting ended in disaster.

Now, with Evelyn growing bolder, Victoria needed a new strategy—fast.

Inside the study, Gregory Whitmore seethed until a knock interrupted his brooding. "Go away!" he snapped.

"Father? It's me." Evelyn's voice softened the edges of his anger.

"Come in, Evelyn."

The door opened quietly. Evelyn entered, carrying a carefully wrapped painting.
###Chapter 42

Gregory's face was stormy with barely contained rage. The scandal involving his eldest daughter Cassandra had dominated social media all morning.

Evelyn approached him cautiously. "Father, getting upset won't help your blood pressure," she murmured, placing a soothing hand on his arm. "This media frenzy will pass. People always move on to the next scandal."

"You're right." Gregory exhaled sharply. At least Evelyn was the dependable daughter who never caused him public embarrassment.

Lately, nothing seemed to go right for Gregory. He massaged his temples before asking, "Did you need something?"

Evelyn nodded and carefully unwrapped the painting she'd brought. "I wanted you to see this."

As the protective paper fell away, the masterpiece 'Geese in Late Autumn' was revealed in all its glory - one of Vivian Sterling's rarest posthumous works that Nathaniel had gifted her.

Gregory's breath caught. "Evelyn! This is Vivian Sterling's 'Geese in Late Autumn'! The art world went wild when it sold for seven million to an anonymous collector! How did you—is this authentic?"

"It is," Evelyn confirmed. "My employer at the estate purchased it. After I saved his grandmother's life, he gave it to me as thanks."

Gregory looked thunderstruck. "He just...gave you a seven-million-dollar painting?"

Evelyn shrugged. "Money means nothing to him. His grandmother's life is priceless."

"I can't believe this," Gregory whispered, tracing the brushstrokes with trembling fingers. His expression turned wistful, haunted by ghosts Evelyn couldn't see.

Seizing the moment, Evelyn asked quietly, "Father...Vivian Sterling was my mother's pseudonym, wasn't she?"

Gregory froze. His head snapped up, eyes wide with shock. "How...how do you know that?"

"The name always felt familiar," Evelyn said. "Then I found an old photo of Mother with 'Vivian Sterling' written on the back in her handwriting."

Gregory sighed heavily. "Yes. Vivian Sterling was your mother."

Evelyn pressed further. "Some of these 'posthumous' works look freshly painted. Do you think...could Mother still be alive?"

"Don't be absurd!" Gregory exploded, slamming his fist on the desk. "Your mother died when you were a child! Those are forgeries!" He grabbed her shoulders urgently. "And you must never tell anyone Vivian Sterling was your mother. Do you understand?"

"Why not?" Evelyn demanded.

Gregory's face twisted with conflict before he spat out, "Because she wasn't my wife! Do you want the world knowing you're illegitimate?"

Evelyn's jaw tightened. Gregory always dodged questions about her mother, confirming her suspicions that darker truths lurked beneath.

Though her memories were faint, Evelyn remembered her mother as regal and composed - never someone who would be a mistress. She refused to believe the family's narrative. Whether her mother was dead or alive, Evelyn would uncover the truth and clear her name.

Leaving the painting with Gregory for safekeeping, Evelyn departed. Despite everything, she knew Gregory still cherished her mother's memory. The masterpiece would be protected.

But the real masterpiece was the puzzle of her mother's life - and Evelyn was determined to solve it.
###Chapter 43

Evelyn wasn't concerned about Victoria and Cassandra damaging the painting. Nathaniel had always kept Vivian Sterling's identity closely guarded, so they remained unaware she was Evelyn's mother. Even if they discovered the truth, Evelyn doubted they'd harm such a valuable piece. Those two might despise her mother, but their love for wealth would override any petty grudges.

Stepping outside, Evelyn headed for the nearest bus stop to return to the Grayson estate.

As she waited, a sleek black car pulled up beside her.

Nathaniel's car. Again. "For heaven's sake," she muttered. "Is this man stalking me or is the universe playing jokes?"

Lucas emerged from the passenger seat and opened the rear door. "Miss Whitmore, Mr. Grayson sent me to collect you."

Noticing Nathaniel's absence, Evelyn's frown deepened. "How did he know I'd be here? Are you following me?" The thought crossed her mind - was he afraid she'd disappear?

Lucas maintained his professional demeanor. "When you mentioned returning home during yesterday's call, Mr. Grayson instructed me to wait for you here."

"Oh. Right." Realizing resistance was futile, Evelyn slid into the car. "Where are we going today?"

Resuming his seat, Lucas turned slightly. "Mr. Grayson wishes to dine with you before returning home together."

Evelyn's eyebrows shot up. "What's gotten into him? Did he wake up on the wrong side of the bed today?" The idea of Nathaniel voluntarily sharing a meal with her seemed absurd.

Lucas's expression stiffened, his mouth twitching slightly. He'd grown somewhat accustomed to her blunt remarks. "Actually, Mrs. Grayson called earlier. She... expressed dissatisfaction about him leaving you alone so often."

"Ah." Evelyn smirked. "That explains it." She crossed her arms. "What's on the menu?"

"French cuisine, if that suits your—"

"Not interested." Evelyn cut him off. "Tell him I want Asian food."

Lucas blinked rapidly, struggling to maintain composure. "I... see. I'll relay your preference immediately."

This woman was unlike any other. Most would kill for a chance to dine with Nathaniel Grayson, let alone dictate the cuisine. Asian food? Lucas couldn't recall Nathaniel ever eating anything but European fare in his entire privileged life.
###Chapter 44

Nathaniel stepped out of the car with Evelyn at his side, his polished shoes clicking against the pavement outside the bustling Asian eatery.

Lucas remained by the vehicle, his jaw slack as he watched his usually refined boss enter the chaotic restaurant without hesitation.

When Evelyn had casually mentioned craving Asian cuisine earlier, Lucas had only made the call to Nathaniel out of obligation. Never in his wildest dreams did he expect Nathaniel would cancel their reservation at the exclusive French bistro for this.

The spicy aromas hit them immediately upon entering. Evelyn claimed a window seat, scanning the laminated menu with practiced ease. "Can you handle spicy food?" she asked without looking up.

Nathaniel gave a curt nod. "I can."

Evelyn marked two fiery soups on the order sheet. The cramped space buzzed with activity, neighboring conversations carrying clearly over the sizzle of woks.

"Oh my God, look at him!"
"Who wears a three-piece suit to a noodle shop?"
"Do you think that's his daughter?"
"More like his mistress - look at that age difference!"

Nathaniel's presence was absurdly out of place - a marble statue in a street market. His sharp gaze swept the noisy dining area. "Don't they have private rooms?"

Evelyn's lips curved. "That defeats the whole point. Real Asian food needs this atmosphere." She pushed the menu toward him. "Your turn, Mr. Grayson."

He barely glanced at it before handing it to the starstruck waitress. "Mineral water. Chilled."

The young server nearly dropped her notepad, flushing scarlet when Nathaniel's icy stare snapped her back to reality. She scurried away without another word.

Evelyn pulled out her phone, content to play games rather than force awkward conversation. The silence between them felt more comfortable than any small talk could.

A sharp rap on the window startled them both.

Sophia Bennett's wide eyes peered through the glass, her palms pressed against it in disbelief. Behind her stood two familiar figures - the elegant woman from Twilight's Snow Room, and the online "friend" who'd tripped Evelyn days before.

Sophia burst into the restaurant like a hurricane. "Uncle Nate! I thought my eyes were playing tricks! Since when do you eat at places like this?"

Nathaniel's expression remained impassive as he gestured toward Evelyn. "Her choice."

That simple phrase sent visible shockwaves through Sophia's companions. The implications hung heavy in the air - since when did Nathaniel Grayson change his plans for anyone?
###Chapter 45

Evelyn watched Sophia's starstruck expression with amusement. "I knew choosing you as my idol was the right decision! You're literally the only person who can drag my uncle out of his high castle to actually experience normal human activities!"

The corner of Evelyn's mouth twitched in a strained smile.

It wasn't her charm doing the work - just their contractual agreement. Since Nathaniel needed her to play the loving fiancée for his grandmother, he had to tolerate these public outings.

Nathaniel's icy glare landed on Sophia. "Weren't you supposed to be reflecting on your mistakes at home? Who gave you permission to leave?"

Sophia stuck out her tongue defiantly. "Sulking at home won't fix my ruined wedding! My fiancé cheated on me - isn't that depressing enough? And you want me locked up alone with my thoughts?"

Ignoring her dramatics, Nathaniel turned his attention to her companions.

Benjamin greeted him respectfully. "Good evening, Nathaniel."

Nathaniel gave a curt nod. "Explain why you're all together."

Gabrielle tucked a curl behind her ear with practiced grace. "Benjamin and I were shopping when we ran into Sophia."

Nathaniel merely hummed in response, his expression unreadable.

Gabrielle's eyes lit up at the spread of food. "You've just started eating, and we're starving. Mind if we join?"

Instead of answering, Nathaniel looked pointedly at Evelyn, who was too busy savoring her dumpling to notice.

When she finally caught his gaze, she shrugged. "Fine by me."

It was his money anyway. She was just here for the free meal.

At her approval, Nathaniel gestured to the empty chairs. "Sit."

Gabrielle's smile faltered momentarily at their silent exchange.

Sophia immediately claimed the seat beside Evelyn while Gabrielle smoothly positioned herself next to Nathaniel. A waiter brought an extra chair for Benjamin.

After ordering, Gabrielle extended a perfectly manicured hand toward Evelyn. "I'm Gabrielle Winslow. Nathaniel and I go way back."

Evelyn took a sip of water. "Evelyn Whitmore. Nice to meet you."

Sophia bounced in her seat. "I've been meaning to ask - how are you so good at dice games? It was insane watching you wipe the floor with everyone!"

Before Evelyn could respond, Benjamin scoffed. "You're idolizing her over dice skills? That's pathetic, Sophia."

Sophia's face scrunched in annoyance. "Back off! She's my queen and I'll admire whoever I want! Who's your so-called goddess anyway?"

Benjamin puffed out his chest. "Ever heard of Luna Sterling? One of the world's top hackers? That's my future wife right there. When I find her, I'm going to spoil her rotten!"

Evelyn choked violently on her food.

Sophia panicked. "Are you okay?"

Nathaniel was at Evelyn's side in an instant, thrusting a napkin at her. "Spit it out. Nobody's stealing your food." His tone was sharp, but his actions were oddly gentle.

Gabrielle stared, shocked by Nathaniel's uncharacteristic concern.

Benjamin rolled his eyes. "Such an obvious act."

Gabrielle frowned. "She's clearly choking!"

"On what? A tiny dumpling? Please." Benjamin sneered. "Just attention-seeking behavior."

Gabrielle opened her mouth to protest but Evelyn stood abruptly. "Restroom. Now."

Gabrielle rose smoothly. "I'll come with you."
###Chapter 46

"I'm coming, Evelyn!" Sophia Bennett stood up to follow Evelyn Whitmore.

Benjamin Rivers stretched his legs across the seat, deliberately blocking Sophia's path. His smirk widened as she huffed in frustration.

"Benjamin, move!"

Sophia rolled her eyes and turned toward Nathaniel Grayson. "Uncle, look at him—"

Nathaniel's cold gaze shifted from Evelyn's retreating figure to the two of them.

Silence fell instantly.

In the restroom.

Evelyn finished washing her hands and stepped away from the sink.

Gabrielle Winslow approached, holding out her jacket sheepishly. "Evelyn, could you hold this for me? There's no hook in the stall."

Evelyn nodded, drying her hands before taking the jacket.

A moment later, Gabrielle emerged. As she washed her hands, she glanced at Evelyn apologetically. "Benjamin's always been blunt. Don't take what he said to heart."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Hmm? What did he say?"

Gabrielle blinked, then laughed. "Good, it didn’t bother you. I didn’t realize you were so easygoing."

Evelyn’s lips curved slightly. "Flattery won’t get you anywhere."

Why would she care about the words of someone irrelevant?

Gabrielle looked different today—casual, softer. Her makeup was still flawless, but less dramatic than at Twilight last night.

So this is the woman Ethan mentioned. The one who made Benjamin trip me yesterday, leading to that embarrassing fall into Nathaniel. But if Gabrielle likes him, and he likes her back… why didn’t he marry her?

Gabrielle reached for the tissues but knocked the box into the trash bin.

She sighed. "Ugh. Those are ruined. Evelyn, could you keep holding my jacket? My hands are still wet."

Evelyn shrugged. "Sure."

When they returned to the table, Nathaniel was gone. Sophia and Benjamin were still bickering.

Gabrielle glanced around. "Where’s Nathaniel?"

Sophia answered, "Too noisy. He stepped outside to take a call."

Gabrielle’s gaze drifted toward the window, searching.

Evelyn ignored them and resumed eating.

By the time they finished, Nathaniel still hadn’t returned. Sophia complained about the heat and suggested they leave.

As they stood, Gabrielle slipped on her jacket—then froze.

"My watch! It’s gone!"

Sophia checked the table and floor. "Not here. Are you sure you brought it?"

Gabrielle shook her head. "No, I had it. I took it off during dinner and put it in my pocket!"

Her voice wavered. "It’s not just any watch. My grandfather gave it to me before he passed away!"
###Chapter 47

Evelyn felt a pang of sympathy for Gabrielle. "What? Don't worry. We'll find your watch together!"

Victoria narrowed her eyes, sensing where this might be going.

Benjamin joined the search abruptly. Then, as if struck by a thought, he whirled toward Evelyn with suspicion. "Hey, weren't you the one holding Gabrielle's jacket when you two went to the restroom?"

Evelyn nodded. "Yes. What about it?"

Benjamin scoffed, his expression dripping with disdain. "Then hand it over now!"

Evelyn's face remained impassive. "I didn't take it. How can I give it back?"

Benjamin seized her arm, treating her like a criminal. "You were the only one who had her jacket. If you didn’t take it, who did?"

Evelyn kept her voice steady. "She asked me to hold it for her in the restroom. That’s all."

Benjamin sneered. "And you conveniently stole it from the pocket!"

"I didn’t," she repeated, calm but firm.

Benjamin wasn’t buying it. "Your word means nothing. If you’re innocent, let us search you!"

Sophia, furious, shoved him back. "Are you insane? Why would Evelyn steal a watch? If she wanted one, Nathaniel would buy her a dozen!"

Benjamin rolled his eyes. "Then she shouldn’t have a problem proving it!"

"No! You have no right to humiliate her like this!" Sophia stood her ground.

Evelyn had risked her life for her yesterday. Today, Sophia would protect her.

Benjamin tried to yank Sophia aside, but she resisted. Their struggle sent Evelyn stumbling back—

Clink.

Something metallic hit the floor.

Benjamin released Sophia and snatched up the object near Evelyn’s feet. His eyes widened in triumph. "What’s this? Still denying it? You’re not fit to be Nathaniel’s wife!"

Gabrielle stared at Evelyn, feigning shock. "Evelyn… you took it?"

Evelyn frowned, glancing at the watch. "I think you know exactly how it got there."

Gabrielle gasped. "Why would I do that?"

Benjamin exploded. "Enough! Everyone saw it fall from you! Stop lying and dragging Gabrielle into it!"

The restaurant patrons gathered, whispering and pointing.

"Stealing from a friend? How low."

"She doesn’t look the type."

"Appearances deceive."

A cold voice cut through the murmurs. "What’s going on?"

Nathaniel’s presence instantly chilled the room. The crowd parted for him.

Sophia rushed over. "Uncle Nathaniel! Benjamin accused Evelyn of stealing Gabrielle’s watch and tried to search her!"

Benjamin waved the watch defiantly. "I didn’t accuse her—it fell right off her! Everyone saw it!"

Nathaniel studied the watch, then turned to Evelyn, his gaze unreadable. "Did you take it?"
###Chapter 48

"Does Nathaniel think I stole the watch too, just like Benjamin and the others?" Evelyn wondered.

The realization hit her - theirs wasn't a real marriage. Trust had never been part of their arrangement. Though slightly disappointed, she quickly brushed it off.

She shook her head calmly. "I didn't take it."

Nathaniel's expression remained unreadable. "Fine. Let's go." The restaurant's overpowering food smells were making him uncomfortable.

Benjamin looked shocked. "You're just leaving?" He blocked their path angrily. "She was caught red-handed!"

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed. "The watch isn't missing. What more do you want?"

"But she's a thief!" Benjamin insisted. "How can you keep someone like that around?"

Nathaniel's displeasure became visible.

Benjamin stiffened, suddenly fearful despite his righteous stance. He pointed at Evelyn. "It's...her..."

Nathaniel's expression turned dangerous. "Say that again."

Gabrielle intervened gently. "Benjamin, let it go. I'm embarrassed this watch caused so much trouble." She took the watch from Benjamin and approached Evelyn. "If you like it, I'll give it to you."

She clasped the watch around Evelyn's wrist with a bright smile. "Consider this a gift to remember our first meeting."

Benjamin scowled. "Gabrielle!"

She gave him a patient look. "I believe Evelyn didn't mean to take it."

"You're too kind," Benjamin muttered.

Evelyn examined the feminine watch with its diamond-studded dial. She smiled delightedly, tracing the gems. "Are you sure? Didn't you say this was your grandfather's last gift?"

Gabrielle smiled indulgently, assuming Evelyn had never owned anything valuable. "Of course! Though it's precious to me, I'm happy to give it to you. This can symbolize our new friendship."

Evelyn chuckled. "Then I'll accept your gift."

Benjamin sneered. "You're actually taking it?"

Evelyn ignored him. She waved her wrist at Nathaniel. "Darling, would you buy me this watch if I wanted it?"

Nathaniel's eyebrows rose at the endearment. "Certainly."

"Perfect!" Evelyn nodded. Then she carefully removed the watch...and dropped it into their unfinished soup.

Gasps filled the room. That watch cost a fortune!

Gabrielle shrieked. "My watch!"

Benjamin roared. "Evelyn! What the hell?"

Calmly, Evelyn wiped her wrist and fingers with tissues as if removing something filthy. She tossed them aside. "Darling, no need to buy me one. Just reimburse Miss Winslow."

Without waiting, she strode out.

Gabrielle's mask slipped. "Nathaniel! How could she?"

Nathaniel watched Evelyn's dramatic exit with amusement before turning cold eyes on Gabrielle. "She's impulsive. Tell Lucas the watch's value - I'll transfer ten times the amount."

Gabrielle looked wounded. "We've known each other for years! You know I don't care about money! That watch held sentimental value. Wasn't Evelyn completely out of line?"
###Chapter 49

Nathaniel narrowed his eyes. "Then why would you give such a valuable item to someone else so casually? Once it's gifted, it's hers to do with as she pleases."

Evelyn's expression twisted in discomfort.

Benjamin still took Gabrielle's side. "Nathaniel, that woman is—"

He stopped mid-sentence when Nathaniel shot him a chilling glare.

"And you," Nathaniel warned, voice low and dangerous. "If I ever hear you speak ill of my wife again, don’t bother calling me next time."

Wife? Nathaniel just called Evelyn his wife?! Benjamin was stunned into silence.

With that, Nathaniel turned and strode out of the restaurant.

Benjamin clenched his fists, frustration boiling over. "If Evelyn is your wife, then what about my sister?"

Nathaniel paused but didn’t respond. Instead, he quickened his pace to catch up with Evelyn.

Sophia finally snapped out of her daze and hurried after them. "Uncle Nathaniel! Evelyn! Wait for me!"

Gabrielle and Benjamin exchanged grim looks.

The murmurs of the crowd grew louder. Benjamin scowled and snapped, "What are you all staring at? Mind your own business!"

Sophia was sent home first. Without her chatter, the car fell into an uneasy silence.

Evelyn rolled down the window, letting the cool night air brush against her skin.

"That watch was worth a hundred and fifty thousand dors," Nathaniel remarked, breaking the quiet.

Evelyn scoffed. "My reputation is priceless."

A smirk tugged at his lips. "So now I owe you?"

She turned to him, eyes wide. "Tell me, did you actually think I stole Gabrielle’s watch?"

He studied her, gaze sharp. "Does it matter what I thought?"

She frowned. "Even if this marriage is fake, we’re still partners. The least we can do is trust each other. Otherwise, this arrangement won’t work."

Nathaniel nodded, an amused glint in his eyes. "Fair point. But for the record, I never doubted you today."

"Really?" Her eyes sparkled with skepticism.

He reached out, tucking a wind-tousled strand of hair behind her ear. "If you wanted money, you could’ve taken anything from the house. No need to steal from others."

Evelyn smirked. "What if I decide to empty your vaults?"

Unlike his usual cold demeanor, his expression softened. "The things at home are outdated anyway. Just tell me what you want, and I’ll have it delivered."

Right. He did promise me anything—except love—for these three months. He’s serious about that.

She sighed. "All I want is for these three months to be over."

His gaze darkened, irritation flickering across his face. "My apologies for the inconvenience of being stuck with me."

She pursed her lips. "It’s too much drama. The wealthy have too many problems, and I don’t want any part of it."

Nathaniel studied her troubled expression, an odd pang forming in his chest. Does she really despise my world that much?

Ding!

Evelyn’s phone buzzed. She pulled it out to find a message from an unknown number.

[If you don’t want your relationship with Mister Nathaniel exposed, meet me at the café near Starry Bridge tomorrow at 3 p.m.]

Attached was a photo of her and Nathaniel sitting together in the restaurant, taken from outside.

Evelyn’s brows furrowed. Who sent this?
###Chapter 50

The clock struck three when Evelyn Whitmore stepped into the quaint café near Stardust Bridge.

The place had an understated elegance, with soft jazz playing in the background. Only three patrons occupied the space—a couple murmuring over tea, and a bespectacled man hunched over his laptop, fingers flying across the keyboard.

Evelyn chose a corner table and ordered a latte with a slice of lemon tart. As she took a bite, her sharp eyes scanned the room.

The couple seemed engrossed in a first date, exchanging polite questions about hobbies and favorite movies. Nothing unusual there.

The man with glasses? Completely absorbed in his work, not even glancing up.

Who had sent her that cryptic message? Had they stood her up?

"Evelyn!"

Her head snapped up at the familiar voice. "Mister Whitmore?"

Edward Whitmore, her former boss from her internship at Kingsley Corp, stood before her. He had gained weight since she last saw him, his cheeks puffing out when he grinned.

"Long time no see, Evelyn."

In truth, it had only been a week since she left the company.

Was he the one who texted me?

Cutting straight to the point, she asked, "What brings you here, Mister Whitmore?"

He slid into the chair opposite her, beaming. "No need to wonder. I was the one looking for you."

Evelyn took a slow sip of her coffee. "So it was you."

He nodded eagerly. "Indeed. I know about you and Mister Grayson."

Her eyebrow arched. "And?"

His smile turned oily. "Let’s be honest—I lost my job because Nathaniel refused to collaborate with Kingsley Corp. And you played a part in that."

Evelyn scoffed. "Me? You’ve got it backward. From what I recall, I was framed when the company’s system was hacked—thanks to your favorite, Rachel Thornton, playing games on company time. And yet I’m the one you blame?"

Edward stiffened. Clearly, he hadn’t expected her to know the details. He cleared his throat awkwardly. "Well, that’s all in the past. What matters now is—"

She cut him off. "Get to the point, Mister Whitmore."

Leaning in, he lowered his voice. "I saw you getting into Nathaniel’s car. And having dinner with him yesterday. You two are clearly… involved." His grin turned sly. "I need a favor."

Evelyn tilted her head. "What kind of favor?"

"Convince Nathaniel to reconsider the deal with Kingsley Corp. If Frederick reinstates me, I’ll keep your little secret."

She leaned back, unimpressed. "And if I refuse?"

His expression darkened. "I did some digging. Nathaniel just got married. How do you think his wife would react if she found out about his… mistress?"
###Chapter 51

"Lover?"

Evelyn Whitmore froze. After a moment, understanding dawned, and she nearly laughed out loud. "Oh, I wouldn't know. His wife might have something to say about that!"

Edward Whitmore smirked, arrogance dripping from his tone. "Exactly! If you want me to keep quiet, you'd better convince Mister Nathaniel to partner with Alpha Enterprises!"

Evelyn sighed, exasperated. "Mister Edward, it's not that I don't want to help. But I can't. Like you said, I'm just his lover. Do you really think I have any influence over his business decisions?"

Edward's grin turned sleazy, his eyes narrowing. "Oh, come on. Women like you have your ways. Make him happy in bed, and he’ll give you anything you want."

Disgust twisted Evelyn’s stomach. She scoffed. "Sounds like you should try it. See if he listens to you when you're the one pleasing him."

Edward’s face darkened. "Evelyn Whitmore! Don’t act all innocent with me! I saw the state of your clothes in his car! You think being young and pretty makes you special? This is your last chance—help me, or else!"

The sheer audacity of him demanding favors while threatening her was almost comical.

Evelyn didn’t flinch. She calmly speared a bite of dessert with her fork. "Sorry. Not happening."

"You ungrateful little—!" Edward slammed his hand on the table and raised his arm to strike—

"Shouldn’t a man your age know better than to hit a woman?"

A smooth, amused voice cut through the tension. A strong hand caught Edward’s wrist mid-swing.

Edward whirled to face the intruder. "Who the hell are you? Mind your own damn business!"

The stranger smirked. "I’m her friend. And you’re not laying a finger on her while I’m here."

Edward was no match—physically or in presence. He yanked his arm back, glowering at Evelyn. "Well, well. Looks like you’ve got another man wrapped around your finger. No wonder Nathaniel keeps you around. But mark my words—you’ll regret this!"

With a final glare, he stormed out.

Evelyn barely spared him a glance, returning to her dessert like nothing had happened.

The man pulled out the chair opposite her, sitting with effortless grace. His grin was all charm. "Fancy meeting you again. Mind if I join you?"

She recognized him—the ridiculously handsome guy who’d tried to flirt with her at Twilight.

"Yes, I mind."

He laughed, undeterred. "That’s how you treat your rescuer?"

Evelyn arched a brow. "You mistook interfering for helping."

Even if he hadn’t stepped in, she’d have jammed her fork into Edward’s hand before he could touch her.

The man leaned forward, eyes gleaming with interest. "You’re fascinating. I’m Christopher Ashford. Let’s be friends."

Evelyn didn’t blink. "Do you want friendship, or are you just angling to get me into bed?"

Christopher’s grin widened. "Can’t it be both?"
###Chapter 52

Evelyn admired Christopher's honesty in his response. Just as she prepared to counter him—

Christopher flashed a charming smile, cutting her off. "Wait, don't answer that. It'll make me look terrible if I keep pestering you after being rejected."

From Evelyn's reaction, he already knew her answer would be no. Even politeness wouldn't change that outcome.

This caught Evelyn off guard. She suddenly realized how perceptive this man truly was.

"Evelyn Whitmore?" Christopher tested her full name.

"Hmm?" She glanced up from her dessert, spoon halfway to her lips.

He grinned. "Nothing. Just heard someone say your name earlier. Wanted to confirm. How do you spell it? E-v-e-l-y-n?"

"No. E-v-e-l-y-n. With two 'e's," she corrected.

"I see. Evelyn Whitmore... Lovely name. You're quite lovely too, though your personality doesn't quite match your appearance," he teased.

She rolled her eyes, which only amused him further.

Christopher chuckled. "Oh, I just remembered—there's a private gallery opening today for first viewings. Free to join me?"

Her refusal was immediate. "No."

Undeterred by the rejection, he leaned forward. "Are you certain? They're exhibiting several lost masterpieces never shown publicly before. A truly rare opportunity."

Evelyn shook her head again. "Thanks, but I should be getting home." Grandma Margaret's special soup awaited her.

Christopher checked his watch. "Home before four? You're more responsible than I thought."

Evelyn ignored him as her phone buzzed repeatedly.

Messages from Sebastian.

[Sebastian: Boss! Found Vivian Sterling's missing works!]

[Sebastian: These three masterpieces haven't been seen since her passing.]

[Sebastian: Sparrow, Night Cat, and The Pink Flamingo!]

Her spine straightened instantly. [Current location?] she typed.

Sebastian responded immediately. [Private gallery exhibition today—invitation only. Owner's inner circle. Maybe ask Mr. Nathaniel if he received an invite?]

Evelyn frowned. [Gallery owner?]

The reply came seconds later.

[Christopher Ashford, eldest son of the Ashfords. Recently returned to take over family business. These are his personal collections—one-day exclusive showing.]

Evelyn's gaze snapped to the man across from her. "Christopher Ashford?"

First time she'd said his name properly. He raised an eyebrow. "Yes?"

"That gallery invitation still open?"

His smile widened. "Naturally. What changed your mind?"

She shrugged. "Realized I've got nothing better to do. Might as well see these paintings you mentioned."

"Excellent timing," Christopher said, standing. "Shall we?"
###Chapter 53

Evelyn stepped into Christopher's car without hesitation, leaving the café behind.

A faint click echoed from a nearby alleyway. A camera lens glinted briefly before disappearing into the shadows.

As Christopher's car pulled away, a sleek orange sports car slid into traffic behind them.

"Follow them."

The driver, Maxwell, shot Benjamin a confused look. "Sir, why are we tailing Mr. Ashford?"

Benjamin smacked Maxwell's head from the passenger seat. "Idiot! It's not him I care about—it's the woman in his car!"

Maxwell paled. "Please don't tell me you're interested in Mr. Ashford's date!"

Another sharp smack landed on Maxwell's head. "Are you blind? That plain girl isn't my type!"

Maxwell rubbed his sore head, privately disagreeing. The woman he'd glimpsed earlier had an ethereal beauty—like a woodland nymph come to life.

Benjamin crossed his arms, his expression darkening. "That's Nathaniel's new wife. The one he married last month."

This revelation only deepened Maxwell's concern. "Sir, this is even worse! You're stalking Mr. Grayson's wife?"

Benjamin barely restrained himself from kicking Maxwell. "Shut up! I'm exposing her true nature! Once Nathaniel sees what kind of woman she really is, he'll finally give Gabrielle a chance!"

Maxwell sighed. "Sir, the issues between the Graysons and the Winslows have nothing to do with—"

"I don't care!" Benjamin snapped. "Gabrielle deserves happiness, and I won't let some scheming woman steal Nathaniel away! Now drive faster before we lose them!"

Frustrated, Benjamin pulled out his phone. He selected the photo of Evelyn entering Christopher's car and sent it to Nathaniel.

Ten minutes passed with no response.

Gritting his teeth, Benjamin dialed another number.

"Abigail? It's Benjamin."

"Benjamin?" Abigail's curious voice came through the line. "What's going on?"

"Your sister-in-law is cheating on Nathaniel," Benjamin announced gravely. "I'm tailing her and her lover right now."

"What?!" Abigail's shriek nearly burst Benjamin's eardrum.

"Evelyn's in another man's car heading god-knows-where. Someone from your family should witness this. Can you come now?"

Abigail's voice turned venomous. "That vile woman! After everything—Grandmother was starting to like her too! I knew she was trouble!"

She launched into a tirade about Evelyn's misdeeds—the toilet incident, the two-faced behavior around Margaret, the attempts to turn Margaret against her...

Benjamin's grip on the phone tightened. "She's a master manipulator. Today, we expose her true colors."

Finally finding a sympathetic ear, Abigail eagerly agreed. "I'll be there! Let me see if I can bring Grandmother too—that'll seal Evelyn's fate!"

"Perfect." Benjamin smirked. "I'll send you the location."

As he hung up, a predatory grin spread across Benjamin's face. 'Evelyn Whitmore, your days as Mrs. Grayson are numbered.'
###Chapter 54

Evelyn and Christopher arrived at a sleek, modern building. He handed the car keys to the valet before leading her inside with effortless charm.

The orange sports car was parked nearby, its occupants watching intently.

"Sir, they're just here for the exhibition," Maxwell reasoned. "There's no affair happening. The tension between our families and the Graysons is bad enough. Stalking Nathaniel's wife will only make things worse!"

Benjamin scoffed. "You don't understand. There's something off about them being here alone."

He stepped out of the car, determined to follow Evelyn inside, but the gallery staff blocked his path. "Invitation required, sir."

Benjamin frowned. "I'm a Rivers. Our families have been close to the Ashfords for years. Let me in."

The staff exchanged glances before checking the guest list.

"Only Samuel Rivers is listed. You're not on here."

Benjamin cleared his throat. "My brother couldn't make it. I'm attending in his place."

After a brief hesitation, they relented. "Very well, Mr. Rivers."

Inside, Evelyn stood before The Pink Flamingo, lost in thought.

"You only seem interested in Vivian Sterling's work," Christopher observed, rejoining her after greeting friends. "Not the more famous pieces."

She met his gaze. "Yes. I admire her."

Curious, he tilted his head. "Why? Her style is niche, not mainstream."

"Because she's my... inspiration." The words nearly slipped—my mother.

Christopher smiled. "I had the privilege of meeting her once."

Evelyn's breath hitched. "When?"

"When I was young. My father bought these three paintings from her and later gifted them to me."

Her pulse quickened. "What was she like?"

He considered. "Beautiful. Gentle yet distant. Uncompromising in her art—just like her work."

Evelyn's chest tightened. He described her mother perfectly—proud, aloof, yet tender with family.

"Christopher," she ventured, "are these paintings for sale?"

He smirked. "You want them?"

She nodded.

"Sorry. Every piece here is priceless to me."

Evelyn's jaw clenched. This won't be easy.
###Chapter 55

Christopher leaned in close, his breath warm against Evelyn's ear. "But if you truly want them," he murmured, "I could give them to you... as engagement gifts when you agree to marry me."

Evelyn scowled, shooting him an irritated glare. She was about to dismiss his ridiculous joke when a sudden, unsettling sensation twisted in her chest.

Her frown deepened, her expression darkening.

Christopher noticed the shift immediately. "What's wrong?"

Beads of sweat formed on her forehead, her lips losing color. "I... don't feel well."

His concern sharpened. "Is it the gallery's temperature? Did you catch a chill?"

"P-Perhaps." Her teeth clenched against the discomfort. A shiver wracked her body.

Without hesitation, Christopher shrugged off his jacket and draped it over her shoulders. "Come, let's get you to the lounge. It's warmer there."

"Thanks."

Her legs wobbled, forcing her to lean into his support as they walked.

Nearby, Benjamin lurked behind a sculpture, phone recording every moment. He smirked. "Alone in the lounge? How convenient. If this isn't incriminating, nothing is."

With a quick tap, he sent the gallery's location to Abigail.

Inside the lounge, Evelyn's condition worsened. Her skin turned ghostly pale, her trembling uncontrollable.

Christopher handed her a glass of warm water. "Should I take you to the hospital?"

She curled inward, arms wrapped around her stomach. "No... I just need to rest. Go back to your guests."

He didn't budge, sitting beside her with genuine worry. "Afraid of hospitals?"

The question caught her off guard. She didn't answer, but the truth was obvious.

As a child, she'd woken in a hospital bed to find her mother gone. Seven days of solitude, followed by her father's grim news. The memory still haunted her.

Christopher didn't press further. "My doctor is on his way. Lie down—I'll wake you when he arrives."

Too weak to argue, she obeyed, curling into a tight ball on the lounge's bed. His jacket still covered her, but he fetched a blanket anyway.

Meanwhile...

"Abigail, why drag me here?" Margaret huffed. "I was making soup for Evelyn!"

Abigail smiled sweetly. "Because your favorite granddaughter-in-law is inside."

Margaret froze. "Evelyn is here?"

A sly nod.

Gallery staff recognized Margaret instantly, bowing as she passed.

Once reunited with Benjamin, the trio hurried toward the lounge—Abigail and Benjamin eager to expose Evelyn's supposed affair, Margaret bewildered but following.

Staff tried to intervene, but Benjamin shoved past. The door burst open.

And there they were—Evelyn, pale and weak, cradled in Christopher's arms.

Margaret gasped. "Evelyn! What on earth is happening?"
###Chapter 56

Evelyn lifted her head weakly, spotting Margaret standing there. Shock flickered across her face.

Despite her exhaustion, she managed a faint greeting. "Grandmother? What are you doing here...?"

Before Margaret could respond, Abigail stepped forward, hands on her hips, her voice dripping with disdain. "Evelyn Whitmore! Have you no shame? The Graysons would never accept a woman like you into the family!"

Benjamin smirked, clearly enjoying the scene. "Evelyn, there's no point pretending now. We caught you."

Evelyn's brows furrowed. She didn't have the strength to argue.

Unlike the others who had stormed in, Nathaniel remained silent, his sharp gaze fixed on Evelyn. She still looked pale, her condition concerning. He studied the dynamics between her and the intruders, piecing things together.

After steadying Evelyn on the bed, he stood and offered a polite smile. "Madam, I wasn't aware of your arrival. Had I known, I would have greeted you properly."

Abigail scoffed. "Oh, please! If we'd warned you, you'd have covered your tracks. And my grandmother doesn't need your fake pleasantries!"

Nathaniel's smile didn't waver, but his eyes turned cold as he ignored Abigail. He addressed Margaret calmly. "Madam, Evelyn was feeling unwell. She nearly collapsed on her way to the restroom. I was simply assisting her when you all arrived."

Benjamin let out a mocking laugh. "How convenient. Do you really expect us to believe that? What else would a man and woman be doing alone in a room?"

Nathaniel's gaze sharpened, his smile turning icy. "Benjamin, I don’t recall you being invited to this exhibition."

Benjamin stiffened, caught off guard. "I—I came on behalf of my brother."

Nathaniel arched a brow. "Did you?"

Just then, Gabrielle hurried in, confusion written across her face. "Benjamin, there you are! Why did you call me here so urgently? What's going on?"

She had been enjoying tea with friends when Benjamin called, claiming he had proof of Evelyn's infidelity.

Benjamin pointed triumphantly at Evelyn. "Gabrielle, look! I caught her red-handed. Not only is she a thief, but she's also cheating!"

Gabrielle's eyes widened as she took in the scene—Evelyn on the bed, wrapped in a blanket, Nathaniel standing protectively beside her. Her expression shifted to shock and disappointment. "Evelyn... How could you? I never thought you'd do something like this!"

Evelyn met Gabrielle's gaze but said nothing. The pain in her stomach worsened, her face ashen. To the others, it looked like guilt.

Gabrielle sighed dramatically and moved to Margaret's side, taking her hand. "Madam, please, don’t be upset. What's done is done. We’ll just have to see what Nathaniel decides."

Margaret ignored Gabrielle’s touch, her sharp eyes never leaving Evelyn. She refused to believe the accusations blindly.

"Evelyn," she said firmly, "tell me what happened. I want to hear your side."

Gabrielle stiffened, withdrawing her hand awkwardly.

Evelyn winced as another wave of pain hit her. She forced herself to meet Margaret’s gaze. "Grandmother, I came to see the exhibition but started feeling ill. Mister Ashford was only helping me when I nearly fainted."

Her pallor was undeniable. Margaret’s expression softened slightly.

"You're sick? What’s wrong?" she asked, concern creeping into her voice.
###Chapter 57

Abigail's blood ran cold when she saw her grandmother Margaret considering Evelyn's words. She couldn't let this happen.

"Grandma, don't listen to her lies!" she interrupted sharply. "If she was truly ill, why hide in this room with another man instead of going to the hospital? Our family can't accept such disgraceful behavior. Evelyn Whitmore is nothing but trouble - first stealing Gabrielle's watch yesterday, and now this!"

Gabrielle played the magnanimous victim perfectly. "It's just a watch, ma'am. Not worth mentioning. But what Evelyn's done today... betraying Nathaniel like this? Unforgivable."

Evelyn's face had lost all color, yet she managed a weak smile. She pushed the blanket aside, struggling to rise. "You don't have to believe me, Grandma Margaret. But I would never dishonor the Grayson name."

Margaret's heart clenched seeing Evelyn's pallid face and unsteady movements. She reached out to steady the girl.

Benjamin couldn't contain his fury any longer. He stormed forward, grabbing Evelyn's collar. "Enough with the act! No one's buying your lies. Just confess and spare us the drama!"

Christopher stepped between them, forcibly removing Benjamin's grip. "Back off! Can't you see she's ill?"

Benjamin sneered. "Oh, protecting your lover now? How touching."

Christopher's usual pleasant demeanor vanished. His eyes turned icy. "Careful with your accusations, Mister Rivers. Slander carries consequences."

The sudden shift in Christopher's demeanor made Benjamin falter. He muttered, "It's not slander when we caught you two together!"

Ignoring him, Christopher turned to steady Evelyn as she swayed. "Evelyn? How bad is it?"

Before she could answer, a deep voice cut through the tension like a blade. "What exactly is happening here?"

Everyone froze.

Nathaniel stood framed in the doorway, his posture rigid, hands in his pockets. His expression was unreadable, but the air around him crackled with restrained fury. Lucas stood behind him, equally grim.

Abigail seized her chance. "Nathaniel! We caught Evelyn cheating with that man!"

"Silence!" Nathaniel's command sent Abigail stumbling back in shock.

She thought his anger confirmed her victory - surely Evelyn was finished now.

Nathaniel's gaze darkened dangerously as he took in the scene: Christopher's hands on Evelyn's shoulders, her ghostly pallor, the accusing stares of the crowd. His jaw tightened.
###Chapter 58

Gabrielle was certain this was the peak of the thrilling tension. A twisted sense of satisfaction curled inside her as she sensed Evelyn's impending downfall. This is what she gets for destroying my watch. Wouldn’t it be perfect if I could openly say she deserves it?

With a feigned sigh, Gabrielle stepped closer to Nathaniel, offering hollow comfort. "Nathaniel, don’t be upset. No one could’ve predicted Evelyn would betray you like this—"

Nathaniel barely spared her a glance before his icy gaze locked onto Evelyn. His voice was sharp. "Come here."

Despite the chaos, Evelyn remained eerily composed. She murmured a quiet thanks to Christopher for his help before moving toward Nathaniel, though her steps were unsteady. "Sir—"

Before she reached him, dizziness struck hard. Her knees buckled, but Nathaniel’s arms shot out, catching her effortlessly. He pulled her against his chest, his brows knitting together in irritation. "Is this all you’ve got? Why are you so fragile?"

The nausea was overwhelming, and his mocking tone only made it worse. If she had even an ounce of strength left, she would’ve punched him. Seriously? I don’t expect concern, but basic human decency would be nice.

Gabrielle, Benjamin, and Abigail stood frozen, their expressions slack with shock. Nathaniel wasn’t reacting like a betrayed man—he was holding Evelyn like she was something precious.

After a moment of leaning against him, Evelyn finally mustered the energy to lift her head. "Hey, where’s the thing I asked you to get?"

Confusion rippled through the room. What thing?

Whatever it was, it made Nathaniel’s usual composure crack. The unshakable, composed man actually looked flustered.

In one swift motion, he pulled a sanitary pad from the inner pocket of his tailored suit and handed it to her.

"Thanks." The moment Evelyn had it in her grasp, she pushed away weakly and headed for the restroom.

Nathaniel gave Lucas a silent command, and the assistant immediately followed her.

The atmosphere in the lounge turned painfully awkward. Gabrielle, Benjamin, and Abigail were speechless. The untouchable, formidable Nathaniel Grayson had just… bought a woman sanitary pads?

Margaret, however, understood instantly. There was no betrayal here—just a misunderstanding. She approached Nathaniel with a frown. "Nathaniel, what’s really going on? You knew Evelyn was here?"

Nathaniel nodded. "Yes. She told me she was attending the art exhibition. When she started feeling unwell, she texted me to pick her up."

The revelation sent a ripple of stunned silence through the room. Benjamin and Abigail flushed crimson. What kind of cheating woman texts her fiancé for help beforehand? This makes no sense!

Margaret, recalling Evelyn’s pale face, grew concerned. "Nathaniel, you should take her to the hospital. She looks terrible."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. He pinched the bridge of his nose. "She’s fine, Grandma. It’s just… a monthly issue. I’ll take her to the doctor if it gets worse."

It clicked for Margaret then—Evelyn wasn’t sick. She was on her period. The discomfort, the weakness—it was menstrual pain.
###Chapter 59

Margaret finally breathed a sigh of relief after confirming Evelyn's health was stable.

The test results showed no pregnancy. The elderly woman sighed wistfully. Her great-grandchild would have to wait at least another month.

Seeing his plan unravel, Benjamin refused to give up. He stepped forward aggressively. "Nathaniel, before you arrived, Evelyn was lying in this bed with another man. Who knows what they were doing before we interrupted? You should divorce that shameless woman!"

Nathaniel turned slowly, his gaze icy. "Why aren't you in class today? And why are you so obsessed with my wife?"

Benjamin shivered under that stare. "I-I took the day off!"

Nathaniel's eyebrow arched. "To stalk my wife?"

"It was coincidence!" Benjamin stammered. "I saw her meeting another man and followed-"

Nathaniel's expression remained impassive. "Benjamin Rivers, let me make this clear. Evelyn is my wife, not my prisoner. She's free to go anywhere, meet anyone. And as her husband, I trust her completely to respect our marriage."

"But she didn't!" Benjamin shouted. "We saw them together on that bed!"

Abigail chimed in, "Brother, she really was-"

Nathaniel cut her off with a glare. "Why are you conspiring with Benjamin? Dragging Grandma here in her condition? Do you realize how dangerous this was for her health?"

Abigail paled. "I didn't-"

"Take her home. Now." Nathaniel's tone brooked no argument.

Gabrielle watched the confrontation unfold differently than she'd anticipated. She stepped forward with false concern. "Nathaniel, they're just kids who care too much about you."

"And you?" Nathaniel's cold stare shifted to her.

Gabrielle stiffened. "I... I care too..."

"You're not a child," Nathaniel stated flatly. "Act like it."

"But we all saw Evelyn on that bed!" Gabrielle protested.

"She came for the exhibition and rested here when she felt ill." Nathaniel's voice held steel. "Is that a crime?"

Gabrielle's eyes darted nervously. "You trust her that much? Over what we all witnessed?"

"I trust my wife more than bored gossips," Nathaniel countered.

Gabrielle stood speechless. This wasn't the first time she'd seen Nathaniel's devotion to Evelyn - that dinner had been proof enough. But this absolute trust? It shook her to the core.

Evelyn was indeed a formidable opponent.

The confrontation ended abruptly. Abigail escorted Margaret home while Gabrielle dragged a protesting Benjamin away.

Only two men remained in the lounge, tension thick between them.

After a long silence, Jonathan flashed a charming smile. "Nathaniel. It's been too long."
###Chapter 60

Nathaniel gave Jonathan a casual nod. "When did you get back?"

Jonathan approached with an easy grin. "About a week ago. It was a rushed trip, so I didn’t have time to catch up with you, Dominic, and the others."

Nathaniel shrugged. "No problem. We can arrange something when you’re free."

Jonathan’s smile widened. "Funny enough, I actually saw you at Celestial Pursuit the other night. You looked busy, so I didn’t want to interrupt."

"Did you?" Nathaniel’s expression remained neutral, but a flicker of ice passed through his sharp gaze.

They had crossed paths from a distance that night—the same night Evelyn lost her bet in the Snow Room. Her 'punishment' had been to kiss a stranger, and the stranger she chose was Jonathan.

Jonathan chuckled. "Heard you just got married. Shame I missed the wedding."

Nathaniel’s lips curved slightly. "Don’t worry. Evelyn and I can host a private dinner just for you."

Jonathan blinked, caught off guard. "That’s... unexpected. I’ll look forward to it."

Before he could respond, Lucas burst into the lounge. "Sir, Miss Evelyn isn’t feeling well. Her nose started bleeding out of nowhere."

Nathaniel’s brow furrowed, and he strode out without another word. Jonathan followed.

The shared washbasin area between the restrooms was where they found Evelyn, bent over the sink, rinsing blood from her face. The porcelain was streaked with diluted red.

She stuffed tissue into her nostrils, then turned—only to find Nathaniel watching her with amused pity.

Her voice was weak. "I’m done. We can go now."

She tried to walk past him, but her steps were unsteady. Before she could take a third, Nathaniel scooped her into his arms.

Evelyn stiffened. "What are you doing?"

"Look at you," he said flatly. "We’re going to the hospital."

"No." She shook her head. "I’m fine."

His grip tightened. "Until our marriage ends, your health is my concern. I’m not planning to be a widower anytime soon."

Ah. Of course. She smirked despite her exhaustion. "Relax. I’ll outlive you."

Nathaniel huffed a laugh. "Then you’ll be the wealthy widow. How convenient."

Her grin turned wicked. "Exactly. All your money, none of the husband."

His expression darkened, but he couldn’t suppress a chuckle. "Maybe I should sleep with one eye open."

Evelyn rolled her eyes and turned her face away.

Fine. If he wants to carry me, let him.

The pain was unbearable—like walking on shards of glass with every step. Except the agony wasn’t in her feet.

It was her stomach.
###Chapter 61

Nathaniel rushed over with a middle-aged man carrying a medical kit. "My personal physician is here, Evelyn. Let him examine you."

'Did he just call her by her first name? I'm her husband, and I've never been that familiar.'

"No need." Nathaniel scooped Evelyn into his arms, brushing past Christopher without a second glance.

Christopher knew Evelyn would hate going to the hospital. He moved to intercept them, but Lucas stepped in his path. "Mr. Ashford, there's no need for concern. Mr. Grayson has already called for an ambulance—it's waiting outside."

'Ambulance?' Christopher's striking blue eyes narrowed as he watched Nathaniel carry Evelyn away. He stood frozen, lost in thought.

Inside the ambulance, Evelyn's face twisted in discomfort—not just from the physical pain, but from the emotional turmoil swirling inside her.

"Wow, what an honor," she muttered through gritted teeth. "I might be the first woman in the city rushed to the ER for menstrual cramps."

Nathaniel sat awkwardly beside her stretcher, his tall frame forcing him to hunch. His head kept bumping against the low ceiling.

As her designated family member, he gave her a disapproving look. "You can't be serious. How do you forget something this basic?" His tone carried the exasperation of a parent scolding a forgetful child.

Evelyn winced. "I didn't forget! It just came early this month—and it's never hurt like this before!" Her pale face flushed with frustration.

Nathaniel studied her. Men like him had zero understanding of female biology.

Seeing her ghostly complexion and sweat-drenched forehead, he reached out. His calloused palm brushed her damp hair before resting gently on her head. "At least you texted me when you felt unwell. That was... unexpectedly responsible of you."

The unexpected contact made Evelyn stiffen. The warmth of his hand felt strangely comforting—and that realization made her even more irritable.

'Like I care about your approval! This marriage is temporary anyway!'

If not for her mother's paintings, she wouldn't have gone to Christopher's exhibition at all. And the only reason she'd texted Nathaniel was because he'd demanded transparency—especially around other men.

Christopher had made his interest obvious. Benjamin had been tailing her all evening, not that she cared.

What she hadn't anticipated was the crippling pain—or Benjamin recruiting Abigail and Margaret to "catch her in the act."

Two EMTs whispered nearby, stealing glances at Nathaniel.

"God, he's gorgeous! And so attentive to his girlfriend!"

"Mine just tells me to drink hot water when I'm cramping."

"At least yours says that much. Mine ignores me completely."

Evelyn shot Nathaniel a sideways glance. 'Perfect boyfriend? More like a perfect nuisance. Someone please take him off my hands!'
###Chapter 62

The emergency room buzzed with quiet urgency. The attending physician pressed gently on Evelyn's lower abdomen, watching her reaction.

"Any localized pain?" he asked before signaling the nurse to call for a second opinion.

An elderly doctor arrived, his brow furrowing as he examined her. He turned to Nathaniel, who stood nearby, arms crossed. "Has she been consuming excessive supplements?"

Nathaniel rarely spent time at home, so he had no clue about Evelyn's diet. Lucas stepped in. "Sir, the housekeeper mentioned the old madam has been preparing various medicinal soups for Miss Evelyn. She's been consuming them daily, along with some rare herbs collected over the years. Could that be the issue?"

The doctor shook his head disapprovingly. "Young and healthy—why overload with supplements? Excessive intake causes internal heat, hormonal imbalances, and irregular cycles. The nosebleeds and cramps are clear signs of overstimulation."

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "How do we treat this?"

The doctor scribbled a prescription. "Simple. Stop the supplements immediately. Take these painkillers, drink plenty of water, and return to a normal diet."

Lucas retrieved the medication while Evelyn struggled to sit up on the hospital bed. Her limbs felt weak as she reached for her shoes.

She fumbled, fingers uncooperative.

Nathaniel arched a brow, lips quirking. "Need help, sunshine?"

Evelyn didn’t look up. "I’ve got it."

Yet her hands refused to cooperate.

A strong, elegant hand suddenly swatted hers aside in mild irritation. He adjusted the shoe opening, lifting the heel slightly to slide her foot in smoothly. Then he repeated the motion with the other.

Evelyn blinked up at him, stunned.

Since when did he grow a conscience?

Lucas returned just in time to witness Nathaniel Grayson—ruthless CEO, feared negotiator—kneeling to put shoes on someone.

His hands were firm yet careful, cradling her small, cold feet. For a fleeting second, Nathaniel wondered if her feet were too tiny or his hands too large.

His expression soured. "Did you really eat everything Grandma forced on you? No backbone?"

Evelyn scowled. "She meant well! How could I refuse her effort? If you bothered coming home for dinner, we could’ve split the burden!"

Nathaniel’s gaze sharpened. "Were you hoping I’d come home more often?"

She considered it, then shook her head. "Actually, no. Dealing with Grandma alone is easier. If you were around, I’d have to pretend affection for an old man like you—just the thought makes me queasy."

His grip on her foot tightened before he abruptly released her. "Walk by yourself, then."

Evelyn gaped. What’s his problem? I’m literally a patient right now!

Back at the Grayson estate, Margaret met them with guilt-ridden eyes. "This is my fault. I thought the supplements would help, not harm you."

Evelyn leaned against the headboard, offering a tired smile. "It’s alright, Grandma."
###Chapter 63

"Her face is ghostly pale, yet she insists she's perfectly fine!" Margaret's voice trembled with concern as she nudged her eldest grandson. "Nathaniel, go massage her stomach. A man's body heat works wonders for menstrual cramps!"

Nathaniel's brow furrowed.

Evelyn's pale cheeks flushed with discomfort. She waved her hands frantically. "Really, it's not necessary! The painkillers are working already, Grandma Margaret."

The elderly woman remained unconvinced. "Nonsense! Since you're feeling better, his touch will speed up the recovery." Her eyes sparkled with determination.

"Grandma—" Evelyn shot Nathaniel a desperate look, silently pleading for intervention.

Nathaniel observed her flustered expression, his lips twitching with amusement. "Don't worry, Grandma. I'll have someone fetch a heating pad instead."

Margaret huffed. "A heating pad? That's no substitute for a husband's touch!" She crossed her arms, scrutinizing their stiff body language. "Why are you two acting like strangers? Don't tell me you haven't even—"

"We have!" Evelyn blurted out, her voice unnaturally high. "Multiple times! Right, Nathaniel?"

Nathaniel's eyes darkened with amusement. "Indeed. Many, many times."

Margaret narrowed her eyes. "Then why the hesitation? Nathaniel, stop dawdling and rub your wife's stomach!"

Under her piercing gaze, Nathaniel moved closer. His warm breath tickled Evelyn's ear as he whispered, "Forgive the intrusion." His large hand settled on her aching abdomen.

The intimate contact made Evelyn's muscles tense. An abdomen was the most vulnerable spot—something only exposed to those one trusted completely. Her pale skin burned crimson despite her forced smile.

Margaret watched with satisfaction. "Better now, dear?"

"Much!" Evelyn squeaked, her voice two octaves higher than usual.

"Excellent! Keep massaging, Nathaniel. And you're both staying in tonight—no arguments!" Margaret declared before exiting.

The moment the door closed, Evelyn squirmed away. "You can stop now!"

Nathaniel's hand remained firmly in place. "I don't mind continuing." His smirk deepened. "Unless... you're embarrassed?"

Evelyn glared. "Of course not!"

"Is that so?" Nathaniel's eyes glinted with mischief. "The same woman who loudly proclaimed our... frequent activities?"

Evelyn wanted to vanish. "Nathaniel Grayson!"
###Chapter 64

Nathaniel's smirk deepened as he watched Evelyn squirm with embarrassment. "Sweetheart, if you want to play the role of a dutiful wife, you should start by calling me by my name. Don't you think 'Mr. Grayson' sounds a bit too formal for a married couple?"

"Call you Nathaniel?" Evelyn wrinkled her nose in distaste. "No way. That would make my skin crawl."

Only a select few in the world had the privilege of addressing him so casually, yet she acted as if it were torture.

Nathaniel's expression darkened, and he pressed his palm a little harder against her abdomen.

The sudden pressure made her wince. "Ow! Not so rough!"

Her voice was weak from the cramps, but the words not so rough hung in the air between them, thick with unintended suggestion.

The silence that followed was charged.

After a beat, Nathaniel chuckled. "How gentle would you like me to be?" His touch softened, fingers tracing slow, feather-light circles over her stomach.

Evelyn shivered, certain he was teasing her on purpose. She scowled. "I'd prefer it if you vanished into thin air. That would be gentle enough."

"Vanished?" He arched a brow. "And here I thought you enjoyed my company."

She planted a hand on his chest, pushing him back. "I don’t! I just—I’m hot, okay?"

Hot. The word only deepened the tension. Her face burned, not from fever but from sheer frustration.

Her lips pressed into a thin line, eyes glistening as if she might cry—an uncharacteristic display of vulnerability from the usually bold Evelyn.

Nathaniel studied her for a long moment, his throat tightening. Enough. He exhaled, pulling back and reaching for the cup of warm water on the nightstand. "Drink this."

She took it with a muttered, "Thanks."

As he stood and headed for the bathroom, Evelyn let out a shaky breath. What’s gotten into him today?

Meanwhile, back at the Grayson estate, Abigail sat fuming in her pink convertible, gripping the steering wheel until her knuckles turned white.

Her failed attempt to expose Evelyn had backfired spectacularly, earning her a scolding from her grandmother. Now, she couldn’t even face her brother without fearing his wrath.

Everything went downhill the moment that gold-digger married Nathaniel.

Her grandmother, who once doted on her, now compared her to Evelyn. Learn from her? What, how to be a penniless schemer?

Just as her temper peaked, she noticed a stocky man lurking near the gates.

Her eyes narrowed. Who the hell is that?

She stepped out of the car and approached him. "Hey! What are you doing here?"
###Chapter 65

Richard froze mid-step, suddenly flustered. "Uh... This is Mr. Nathaniel's residence, correct? I'm here to see his wife."

'His wife? Does he mean Evelyn?'

Just hearing Evelyn's name made Abigail's blood boil. She eyed Richard with open disdain. "What business could you possibly have with her?"

Richard took in Abigail's head-to-toe designer ensemble - all limited edition pieces.

He ventured a guess. "Miss, did you say this was your home? Could you be... Mrs. Grayson?"

Abigail's brow furrowed. This fool didn't even know what her brother's wife looked like.

She didn't correct him. "Suppose I am. Why are you looking for her?"

Richard's face lit up with an oily smile. "Mrs. Grayson, I believe you'd be very interested in learning about Mr. Nathaniel's... extracurricular activities. Care to discuss over coffee?"

'My brother's affair?' Abigail's curiosity piqued. After a moment's hesitation, she nodded. "Not here. Follow my car."

Richard trailed Abigail's cherry-red convertible to an upscale patisserie. Once seated, he slid several photos across the table.

The images showed Nathaniel and Evelyn together - nothing scandalous. Abigail barely glanced at them. "Why are you showing me these?"

Richard blinked at her calm reaction. "Mrs. Grayson, that's Evelyn Whitmore - your husband's mistress!"

Abigail nearly choked on her latte. "Mistress?"

'This idiot has no idea,' she thought, suppressing a laugh.

Richard leaned in. "She's seducing Mr. Nathaniel with her youth and looks. I can help eliminate this problem... for a small favor in return."

Revenge against Evelyn? Now this was interesting. "What kind of favor?"

"Nothing difficult," Richard assured her. "Just a business investment."

Abigail smirked. "Deal. Get rid of that Evelyn bitch and make sure my broth—I mean, my husband despises her, and I'll secure that investment for Alpha Enterprises."

Richard practically glowed. "Pleasure doing business, Mrs. Grayson! Give me a week - Nathaniel will loathe her soon enough."

After he left, Abigail lingered, sipping her drink with malicious anticipation.

'Let's see you wriggle out of this one, Evelyn.'

The next morning, Nathaniel unusually joined breakfast at the estate.

Evelyn found herself the center of Margaret's fussing. The elderly woman fretted over her recovery. "Nathaniel, feed your wife! She's still weak!"

Evelyn protested, but Margaret insisted.

She expected Nathaniel to refuse - the ice-cold CEO would never stoop to such domesticity. To her shock, he smirked and began cutting her omelet into precise bites.

Forced to play along, Evelyn endured the mortifying display with a tight smile. A ringing phone finally saved her. She practically bolted from the table.

It was the dean of New Capital University calling.
###Chapter 66

The phone call came unexpectedly. Evelyn hadn't spoken to the university dean in months. After exchanging brief pleasantries, the older man cleared his throat.

"Your graduation ceremony is next Monday, Evelyn. As one of our most distinguished graduates, we'd like you to bring your parents. The faculty hopes they'll join you on stage to share insights about your academic journey."

Evelyn's grip tightened on her phone. "That won't be possible. I don't have parents."

"Don't be ridiculous! Your records clearly list both father and stepmother as living."

Before she could respond, someone called the dean away. "Remember - Monday morning with both parents present!" The line went dead before she could protest.

The irony wasn't lost on her. Technically, Gregory Whitmore was alive - just never present. He'd provided the bare minimum, never attending a single parent-teacher conference. As for Victoria? That woman wouldn't cross the street to spit on Evelyn if she were on fire.

Still, the dean had always championed her. With a sigh, she dialed her father's number. "Are you free next Monday?"

Gregory's cheerful voice carried through the phone, background chatter suggesting a family breakfast. "Monday? That's your sister Cassandra's contract signing! It's being broadcast live! Victoria and I need to look our best to support her career!"

Evelyn's eyebrows shot up. "Cassandra landed another deal? That scandal didn't stick, I see."

"Pure slander!" Gregory boomed. "That video showed some cheap lookalike! Victoria uncovered the truth and got retractions printed in every major outlet! Now Holden Media wants to sign her - biggest entertainment conglomerate in the world!"

Evelyn smirked. Victoria's damage control skills never ceased to amaze.

"You asked about Monday?" Gregory continued. "What did you need?"

"My graduation ceremony." She kept her tone neutral. "The university requested parental attendance."

"Evelyn, your academics have always been impeccable - no need for me to be there. This contract could make Cassandra an international star!" His dismissal was swift, final.

"Understood." The call ended with her usual sarcastic smile.

Her phone immediately buzzed with Cassandra's barrage of texts:

[Begging Daddy to come? Pathetic.]

[Good grades mean nothing when you're just his bastard child.]

[Guess what? Holden Media signing! Soon I'll be global superstar! Daddy bought me limited edition Chanel to celebrate!]

A photo followed - an obscene display of designer handbags.

[Cool story.] Evelyn typed back.

Cassandra fired off one last jab: [You'll always be beneath me, illegitimate trash.]

Evelyn tossed her phone aside, more concerned about explaining the parental no-show to the dean.

The bedroom door swung open. Nathaniel strode in, rummaging through the closet before producing a suit jacket.

"Over here," he commanded.

She didn't budge. "Why should I?"

"Tie." He held out the silk length.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Only her stupid promise to play the dutiful wife made her comply.

Standing on tiptoes, she looped the tie around his neck. The height difference made the simple task awkward, her fingers fumbling against his crisp collar. Nathaniel remained still, watching her struggle with apparent amusement.
###Chapter 67

Nathaniel's lips curved into a teasing smirk as he watched her struggle.

When Evelyn finally managed to knot his tie, she glanced up and suddenly remembered something. "Are you free next Monday?" she asked.

"No," he answered flatly, his tone indifferent.

Evelyn pressed her lips together but said nothing more. She did, however, deliberately tug his tie crooked before stepping away.

He glanced down, adjusting the silk fabric back into place. "Why? What's happening Monday?"

Evelyn turned to study Nathaniel. After a moment's consideration, she realized bringing him to her graduation ceremony was problematic.

Even if he had time, what role would he play there? A man of his status would only draw unwanted attention.

"Nothing. Just curious," she lied, abandoning the idea.

Nathaniel didn't press further. Instead, he closed the distance between them, tilting her chin up with two fingers. "Still having stomach pains?" he asked with mock concern.

Evelyn glared. "Thanks for your concern, sir. I'm perfectly fine now."

"Good. Try not to die in my house," he deadpanned, releasing her. Slinging his suit jacket over one arm, he turned to leave.

Evelyn shook her fist at his retreating figure. This man deserves a good punch.

Margaret came to mind next, but Evelyn hesitated. While the elderly woman would gladly attend, the lengthy ceremony might be too taxing.

I'll go alone.

Monday arrived swiftly. The university auditorium buzzed with excitement as the dean began his opening address.

Each department's top student stood proudly with their families—except Evelyn. She stood conspicuously alone in the front row.

Up in the academic affairs office, the director frowned. "Mr. Grayson, this is the seventh course your sister has failed. At this rate, she may not graduate."

Nathaniel massaged his temples, having long given up on Abigail's academic pursuits. His gaze drifted downward through the window—and caught sight of Evelyn on stage. "What's that?"

"The senior graduation ceremony," the director explained. "Those are each department's top students with their families." He blinked at Evelyn's solitary figure. "Strange... Why is Miss Whitmore alone? She's our most distinguished student."

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed. So this was why she'd asked about Monday.

The director sighed. "Shame her family doesn't appreciate such an exceptional daughter."

A smirk played on Nathaniel's lips. "Does a husband count as family?"

The director startled. "Pardon?"
###Chapter 68

The graduation ceremony stage was bathed in golden light. Natalia Petrova, the star student of New Capital City University's music department, stood proudly beside her father as she delivered her emotional farewell speech. Tears glistened in both their eyes, overwhelmed by the memories of the past four years.

"Natalia's father is absolutely gorgeous! And he looks so young!"

"No wonder Natalia is the most beautiful girl on campus—she clearly inherited her parents' perfect genes!"

"Did you hear? Her father just donated three grand pianos to the music department! That's insane!"

"I wish I had Natalia's life. Wealthy family, doting parents, beauty, brains—she has it all!"

Natalia descended the stage, basking in the admiration of her peers.

Backstage, she spotted Evelyn Whitmore sitting quietly, waiting for her turn.

According to tradition, the final speaker was always the most distinguished. Natalia hated the arrangement, but she couldn't argue—it had been the dean's decision.

With a calculated smile, Natalia approached Evelyn. "Did you come alone today?"

Evelyn nodded. "Yes."

Natalia sighed dramatically. "I heard from classmates that you're an illegitimate child, abandoned in the countryside and only admitted here because of sheer determination. It must have been so hard, growing up without your parents' love. No wonder you work so relentlessly—you have no one to rely on but yourself. I can't imagine living like that. My parents spoil me rotten—anything I want, they give me."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Is that so? Do you plan to depend on them forever?"

Natalia's expression darkened. "I was just showing concern, Evelyn. No need to be so bitter. My father always says poverty makes people resentful—clearly, he was right."

The emcee announced Evelyn's name. Without another glance, Evelyn walked past her and onto the stage.

She thanked her alma mater, her professors, and reflected on her journey with quiet confidence. Unlike the tearful, rehearsed speeches before hers, Evelyn's words were sharp, witty, and deeply moving. The audience laughed, then cried, completely captivated.

Whispers spread through the crowd.

"That's Evelyn Whitmore for you—her speech was incredible!"

"She might not have Natalia's background, but she's still the real star here."

"Honestly, Evelyn is way prettier than Natalia. And smarter."

"Pretty and smart, sure, but she's still a bastard child. Did you see? No one from her family came today."

"I heard her father had an affair. Like mother, like daughter—who knows what she's really like?"

Natalia, now seated among her peers, tugged at a friend's sleeve with fake sympathy. "Don't be mean! Evelyn's life is tragic. If she ever did anything questionable, it was just to survive."

Her face was pitying, but inside, she was thrilled.

Before university, Natalia had always been the center of attention. Then Evelyn arrived, topping the national entrance exams and stealing her spotlight.

Finally, Natalia had found the one thing Evelyn could never compete in—family.

Evelyn's speech wasn't over when the auditorium suddenly fell silent.

Then, murmurs erupted.

"Who is that man walking on stage? He's breathtaking!"

"Oh my god. I've never seen anyone so handsome in my life!"
###Chapter 69

"He's not just gorgeous. There's this dangerous magnetism about him too. Definitely the VIP guest the university invited."

Evelyn was wrapping up her speech when she noticed the audience's attention had shifted. Every eye seemed glued to something behind her.

She turned—and froze. 'What's he doing here?!'

Nathaniel's piercing gaze swept over her as he strode forward. Towering beside her, he adjusted the microphone with effortless grace. His deep, velvety voice filled the auditorium. "Good afternoon. I'm here as Evelyn's family representative. My thanks to New Capital University for nurturing her talents."

He paused, the weight of his presence silencing the room. "I'll be brief. To show our appreciation, I'm donating a state-of-the-art research facility in Evelyn's name."

Evelyn's lips parted in shock. 'Is he out of his mind?'

The announcement sent shockwaves through the crowd. University officials gaped at the unexpected seven-figure gift.

"Damn! When you're that rich, you don't need words—just drop a building!" someone whispered.

"That's the most breathtaking man I've ever seen! Who is he to Evelyn anyway?"

"Family, he said. Brother? They look nothing alike!"

"Too young to be her father, right?"

The dean practically tripped over himself reaching the podium. "Students! Let's thank Miss Whitmore and her family for this extraordinary generosity!" Thunderous applause erupted.

Natalia's face twisted in fury. Once again, Evelyn had stolen her moment. Those three grand pianos her father promised now seemed laughably insignificant.

'Impossible! She's supposed to be some nobody bastard! Who the hell is that billionaire Adonis?'

Meanwhile, during intermission, a breathless classmate burst into Abigail's dorm. "Abby! Your brother just donated an entire building!"

Abigail, still sniffling from Nathaniel's earlier scolding about her grades, brightened instantly. "See? He still loves me! He's making sure professors go easy on me!"

The classmate winced. "Actually...it's not for you."

Abigail scoffed. "Don't be ridiculous. Who else would—"

"It's for a graduating senior named Evelyn Whitmore."

Abigail's smile vanished. "Evelyn goes here?!"

"You didn't know? She's legendary—top national exam scorer, dean's personal recruit. Even Julian Hartwell's been chasing her for three years without success."

Abigail's blood ran cold. Julian—the senior she'd been hopelessly crushing on—was in love with Evelyn?

"Wait," the classmate frowned. "I thought you only had one sister. Is Evelyn your half-sister or something?"

Abigail's nails dug into her palms. "She's no relation to us!"

"Then why would your brother claim her as family? And donate a building in her name?"

Abigail's voice turned venomous. "Because she's—"
###Chapter 70

"She's a witch!" Abigail couldn't bring herself to admit Evelyn was her brother's wife. That was a title she refused to grant Evelyn.

Her classmate shifted uncomfortably, unsure why Abigail harbored such hatred. "Well... Regardless, your family is loaded! Donating a whole building just like that—insane!"

The Graysons had always maintained discretion. While everyone knew Abigail came from wealth, no one realized she belonged to the elite Grayson dynasty. And certainly, no one suspected her brother was Nathaniel Grayson himself.

Abigail wasn't in the mood for flattery. "Is my brother still on campus?"

"Probably finalizing the donation details with the dean," her classmate replied.

Abigail stormed out of the classroom, yanking her phone from her pocket to dial Edward.

"Hey! You promised to make my broth—my husband despise Evelyn. It's been days. What exactly have you accomplished?"

Edward sighed in frustration. "Honestly, Mrs. Grayson, I've been staking out the Whitmore residence for days, but Evelyn's nowhere to be seen! How am I supposed to act if she never shows? Where's that sly little fox been hiding?"

Abigail clenched her teeth. Of course Edward wouldn't find Evelyn at the Whitmores—he didn’t know the truth. Evelyn lived with the Graysons now. Staking out the wrong house was pointless.

"I'll send you Evelyn's location. Get it done. Today."

Edward perked up. "Perfect! That'll make things much easier."

Hanging up, Abigail's expression darkened. Ever since Evelyn married into the family, neither Margaret nor Nathaniel treated her the same. Their indulgence had vanished, replaced with constant disapproval.

Abigail's ideal sister-in-law had always been the elegant Victoria Blackwood—graceful, refined, and endlessly kind to her. For Victoria’s sake alone, Abigail was determined to rip Evelyn out of the Grayson family tree.

Inside the dean’s office, Nathaniel finalized the building donation details. The dean escorted him out with deep respect, Evelyn trailing silently beside him. She never expected to witness such a grand gesture unfold in her name.

The campus corridors were quiet as they walked.

Evelyn glanced up at Nathaniel’s striking profile. "Why did you come today?"

He kept his pace steady, barely sparing her a look. "When you asked if I was free on Monday, it was about your graduation, wasn’t it?"

She didn’t deny it. "Yes."

"Then why didn’t you just ask properly?"

"I reconsidered. It wasn’t worth your time."

Nathaniel nodded. "To me, it isn’t worth my time." Evelyn barely suppressed an eye roll. Of course.

Then he added, "But for you, it’s a milestone. You’re still my wife—for now. So I’ll indulge even your smallest requests."

Evelyn scoffed. "You didn’t have to donate a building just to flex your wealth."

His lips curved. "You think I did this for you? I’m supporting education. You were merely a convenient excuse."

She rolled her eyes. "How noble of you."

If he truly cared about philanthropy, he could’ve donated anonymously. Instead, he ensured the building would bear her name—making it impossible to untangle their association later.

Suddenly—

"Evelyn!" A voice cut through the hallway.
###Chapter 71

Evelyn halted mid-step when she heard her name being called. She turned to see a breathless young man jogging toward her.

Julian Hartwell, a senior from the literature department, stood before her with flushed cheeks. His chest rose and fell rapidly as he tried to catch his breath.

"What is it, Julian?" Evelyn tilted her head, her dark curls bouncing with the movement.

The bashful upperclassman rubbed his neck awkwardly. "Congratulations on graduating, Evelyn!" His smile was as bright as the afternoon sun streaming through the corridor windows.

"Thank you." Her lips curved in response.

Julian's gaze flickered to the imposing figure beside Evelyn. "And this gentleman is...?"

"My uncle!" Evelyn declared without missing a beat.

Nathaniel Grayson's jaw tightened imperceptibly at the designation.

Upon learning Nathaniel's familial relation, Julian executed a perfect ninety-degree bow. "Pleasure to meet you, sir!"

Nathaniel's icy stare swept over the boy before dismissing him entirely.

Undeterred, Julian turned back to Evelyn with pink-tinged ears. "Could we speak privately for a moment?"

"Wait here, Uncle." Evelyn followed Julian to a quiet alcove near the stairwell.

From his vantage point, Nathaniel observed the exchange with narrowed eyes. The boy removed his second jacket button mid-conversation and pressed it into Evelyn's palm. She examined the offering before smiling.

Lucas Sinclair, ever attuned to his employer's unspoken questions, supplied the explanation without prompting. "In certain cultures, the second button represents one's heart. That young man is essentially declaring his affection."

Nathaniel's expression darkened as Evelyn accepted the sentimental token. Fragments of past conversations resurfaced - her admitted preference for sweet, submissive boys who'd call her 'mommy'. This gangly literature student fit the description alarmingly well.

"Do all university students engage in such juvenile displays?" Nathaniel's voice carried an edge.

Lucas cleared his throat. "With all due respect, sir, they're consenting adults. This hardly qualifies as puppy love."

Nathaniel lit a cigarette, watching through the haze as Evelyn reached up to ruffle Julian's hair. Though he couldn't hear their words, her amused expression spoke volumes. The boy flushed crimson under her attention, despite their near-equal height.

After taking a long drag, Nathaniel stubbed out the half-finished cigarette with unnecessary force.

The car ride commenced in heavy silence. Evelyn busied herself with responding to Sebastian's messages, fingers flying across her phone screen.

Just as the vehicle began moving, Abigail Grayson materialized beside the car, rapping sharply on the window. She slid into the backseat without waiting for invitation. "Nathaniel! Evelyn! Mind if I hitch a ride?"

Nathaniel's glacial gaze met his sister's. "Skipping classes now?"

Abigail shrank back. "No! I have no afternoon lectures—"

A curt nod from Nathaniel sent the car rolling forward.

To everyone's surprise, Abigail scooted closer to Evelyn with uncharacteristic warmth. "I had no idea you attended New Capital University! Why haven't I seen you around campus?"

Evelyn studied the sudden shift in Abigail's demeanor. "I completed most requirements through internships."

"Fascinating!" Abigail's smile didn't reach her eyes.
###Chapter 72

Abigail tapped her chin thoughtfully. "Since it's your graduation day, we should celebrate!"

Evelyn stretched lazily. "No need. It's just another day."

Undeterred, Abigail linked arms with her enthusiastically. "Four years of university is an achievement! There's this new boutique at Eastbridge Mall with exclusive designer pieces. Let's check it out?"

Evelyn glanced at their entwined arms with raised eyebrows. "Shopping? Now?"

Abigail nodded vigorously. "Why not? It's better than going home bored. Come on!"

Though surprised by Abigail's sudden friendliness, Evelyn considered the benefits of keeping peace in the Grayson household.

"Fine," she conceded after a pause. "Let's go."

Abigail's face lit up instantly. She turned to Nathaniel. "You're coming with us, right?"

Nathaniel barely looked up from his documents. "I'm busy."

Exactly the response Abigail wanted. "Then have the driver drop us at Eastbridge Mall," she said sweetly.

As they exited the car, Nathaniel rolled down his window. "Don't stay out too late," he told Evelyn.

"Got it," Evelyn replied, amused by his parental tone. She assumed he was worried about his precious sister's influence.

Inside the mall, Abigail suddenly clutched her stomach. "Oh no! I need the restroom!" she gasped.

Evelyn spotted an "Under Maintenance" sign on the nearest restroom. "This one's closed. Let's find another floor."

"I can't wait!" Abigail insisted, already rushing toward the restricted area. "I'll use whatever stall works. Wait here!"

Before Evelyn could stop her, Abigail disappeared inside.

Minutes passed with no sign of Abigail. Growing concerned, Evelyn entered the dimly lit restroom.

Darkness engulfed her as a sack was pulled over her head. A sharp blow to her skull sent her collapsing unconscious.

The bathroom door creaked open. Abigail stepped out, smirking triumphantly. "Fell right into my trap, didn't you, Evelyn?"

At Suite 3201 of Grayson International Hotel, Evelyn lay motionless on the bed.

Abigail stood over her, arms crossed in satisfaction. The helpless woman resembled a fish on a cutting board.

"Make sure nothing traces back to me," Abigail instructed sharply.

Edward Whitmore gave a confident grin. "Everything's arranged perfectly, Miss Grayson. Nothing will go wrong."

Abigail eyed him critically. "It better not."

"You'll be completely satisfied, I guarantee."

Edward turned to the blond man waiting nearby. "You heard Miss Grayson. Take good care of our guest here. And remember what to say when the police come knocking?"
###Chapter 73

The repulsive blond man licked his cracked lips, revealing yellowed teeth in a grotesque grin. "Perfect, Edward! This is exactly my kind of job! Don't forget I spent three years in prison for running that escort ring!"

His bloodshot eyes raked over Evelyn's unconscious form on the bed. Fresh out of jail after a five-year stint, he hadn't touched a woman in ages. The parole officer breathing down his neck made finding work impossible, let alone affording female company.

When Edward had approached him with this proposition, he'd jumped at the chance. Getting paid to defile this beauty? He'd have done it for free. Hell, he'd gladly go back to prison for another decade if it meant having her.

Abigail's stomach churned watching the man's predatory excitement.

After Evelyn had humiliated her by shoving her head in that toilet, she'd vowed revenge. Now Evelyn would know true disgust - permanently.

The plan was simple: frame Evelyn as a high-end escort caught mid-transaction at the Grayson family hotel. Once Nathaniel saw the police reports, he'd never look at her again.

Exactly as Abigail intended.

With Nathaniel out of the picture, Margaret would immediately disown the "soiled" girl. The old matriarch's Victorian sensibilities wouldn't tolerate such scandal.

Edward cleared his throat. "Miss Grayson, perhaps we should leave before the... unpleasantness begins?"

Abigail nodded, casting one last triumphant glance at Evelyn before sweeping out of the suite.

Alone at last, the blond man tore at his stained shirt, drool dripping onto his unwashed chest as he lunged toward the bed.

Abigail arrived home to find Nathaniel waiting in the parlor, newspaper in hand.

"You're early," she remarked, smoothing her skirt.

Nathaniel's piercing gaze lifted. "Where's Evelyn?"

"Oh, she ran into some old friend at the mall," Abigail said airily. "Blond fellow. They seemed... quite close."

Nathaniel's fingers tightened around his coffee cup. "Old friend?"

Before Abigail could elaborate, Lucas burst in. "Sir! Emergency at the hotel!"

Nathaniel didn't even look up. "Report."

Lucas swallowed hard. "Police raided suite 3201. Arrested two people in a prostitution sting. The media's already picked it up - it's a PR disaster."

Abigail hid her smirk behind a cough. Perfect.

That wretched Evelyn would be out on the streets by morning.
###Chapter 74

Nathaniel's fingers turned the page of the financial report with deliberate calm. "What's the police update?"

Lucas adjusted his tie nervously. "Still interrogating the suspects. No official statement yet."

Such scandals were dime a dozen in high society. Hardly worth the media circus brewing outside.

Nathaniel took a measured sip of espresso. "Control the narrative. No press releases until we have facts."

"Understood." Lucas hesitated, then blurted, "Sir...rumors are circulating. The woman involved—they're saying it's Evelyn Whitmore."

The financial report crumpled in Nathaniel's grip as his head snapped up, eyes turning glacial.

Lucas swallowed hard. "I verified the hotel records. Suite 3201 at Grayson International was booked under her name this afternoon. All calls to her phone go straight to voicemail."

A muscle twitched in Nathaniel's jaw. "We don't convict on rumors. Find her. Now."

Abigail chose that moment to sweep in, phone clutched dramatically. "That's absurd! Evelyn would never—" Her eyes widened with calculated realization. "Unless..."

Her phone buzzed with Edward's confirmation: [Mission accomplished. Remember our deal.]

[Your payment's waiting,] Abigail typed back, smirking. She pulled up the trending news segment: [Socialite Evelyn Whitmore and companion detained in prostitution sting at Grayson Hotel.]

"Nathaniel!" she gasped, thrusting her screen forward. "Look at the woman's outfit—identical to what Evelyn wore today! And that blond man—wasn't that the 'friend' she met at the galleria?"

Nathaniel studied the blurred footage. The emerald green dress matched perfectly.

Abigail pressed a hand to her mouth. "No wonder she refused to let me join their 'reunion.' Disgusting."

Margaret's voice carried from the hallway. "Children? Where's Evelyn? Dinner's getting cold!"

Before Nathaniel could intervene, Abigail rushed to the elderly woman. "Grandmother! Evelyn's been arrested!"

Margaret staggered. The butler Theodore caught her just as her knees buckled. "What nonsense is this?"

Abigail shoved her phone forward. "See for yourself! Prostitution charges!"

Margaret's wrinkled hands trembled. The emerald dress was unmistakable. "This...this can't be..."

"None of us want to believe it," Abigail said with faux sympathy. "But evidence doesn't lie."

The house phone shrilled. Theodore answered, then paled. He hit the speaker button without preamble.
###Chapter 75

The phone call cut through the tense silence like a blade.

A stern voice spoke from the other end. "Hello, this is Eastbridge Police Station. Is this Evelyn Whitmore's residence?"

Theodore glanced up, seeking direction from Nathaniel. Only when Nathaniel gave a slight nod did he respond. "What seems to be the issue?"

The officer's tone was firm. "If you're a family member, we need you to come to the station immediately. Your assistance is required for verification."

The line went dead.

Margaret sank onto the couch, her face pale.

Abigail's panic flared. "Did you hear that, Grandma? The police called! It has to be Evelyn! How could she do something like this after everything you've done for her?"

Margaret clutched her chest, heartbroken.

Nathaniel stood, grabbing his jacket from the sofa. His voice was sharp as he addressed Abigail. "Stay here with Grandma. Don’t leave."

Abigail rushed to block his path. "Nathaniel! Stop defending that disgrace! She’s not worth it! If you keep getting involved, she’ll ruin our family’s reputation!"

Nathaniel’s frown deepened. "Enough. Move."

She refused to back down. "She doesn’t deserve your help!"

Then—

A lazy, sleep-heavy voice drifted down the stairs.

"Oh, you're home early. Grandma, I'm starving. Isn’t it dinner time yet?"

Evelyn stood at the top of the staircase, rubbing her eyes as if she’d just woken from a nap.

Silence.

Margaret gasped. "Evelyn? You're here?"

Evelyn blinked. "Yeah?"

Abigail’s face twisted. "You—how are you here? Weren’t you—?"

Evelyn yawned. "Why wouldn’t I be here? Where else would I be?"

Abigail’s mind raced. Edward had confirmed the job was done. So why was Evelyn standing in front of them, unharmed?

Her lips curled in accusation. "Did you run from the police? First, you humiliate yourself, and now you’re dragging us into your mess?"

Evelyn tilted her head. "Police? What are you talking about?"

Abigail scoffed. "Stop pretending! The scandal is everywhere online! The police just called for you! Admit it!"

Evelyn’s brows lifted slightly. "A scandal?" She walked to the phone calmly. "I have no idea what you mean. Let me call them back and ask."

She pressed redial.

"Hello? This is Evelyn Whitmore. May I ask why you’re looking for me?"
###Chapter 76

The phone call continued on speaker mode. The officer's voice crackled through. "Evelyn Whitmore, your wallet and phone were stolen. The thief even used your identity to book a hotel room. Please come to the station immediately to verify the items and report any losses."

Evelyn responded politely. "Understood. Thank you, officer."

"You're welcome," the officer replied before ending the call.

Evelyn turned to Abigail with a pointed look. "That's it? Since when is losing something a scandal? Care to explain why you thought the police were after me?"

Abigail froze, her mind blank. This wasn’t supposed to happen. The police were supposed to arrest her, not return her lost belongings!

"Oh, Evelyn! I’m so relieved you're safe!" Margaret pressed a hand to her chest, exhaling in relief. Then she shot her granddaughter a sharp glare. "Abigail, what is wrong with you? Stop spreading baseless rumors!"

Abigail clenched her fists, refusing to back down. "Grandma, I’m not lying! Lucas even confirmed Evelyn checked into that hotel today! The woman in the news was her! Why else would she be wearing the same outfit as that escort?"

It was true—Evelyn’s clothes matched the woman’s exactly. Yet she remained unshaken. "My outfit isn’t exclusive. Coincidences happen. But why are you so determined to paint me as an escort?"

Abigail scoffed. "Coincidence? The hotel has your name on record, and you’re dressed identically to that woman. How many ‘coincidences’ do you expect me to believe?"

Evelyn shrugged. "The officer already explained—someone stole my ID and booked the room. I lost my things after shopping with you. When I couldn’t find you, I came back alone."

Abigail smirked. "Nice try, Evelyn. But I’m not buying it."

That flimsy excuse might fool Margaret, but not her. She saw Nathaniel taking Evelyn to that hotel. Things didn’t add up.

Evelyn tilted her head. "You seem awfully sure I was there. Did you see me at the hotel? Were you there too?"

Abigail stiffened. "W-Why would I be there? I wasn’t!"

She had seen it, but admitting that would expose her scheme.

Margaret stepped between them, sighing. "Evelyn, forgive Abigail. She’s always been hot-headed and reckless with her words. I’ll discipline her properly."

Evelyn was her favorite granddaughter-in-law, and Abigail her beloved granddaughter. Seeing them clash pained her.

Disappointed, Margaret swatted Abigail’s arm. "You were wrong. Apologize."

Abigail gritted her teeth. Things hadn’t gone as planned, and now she was being forced to back down. With no proof, she muttered, "Fine. I was wrong."

Evelyn gave her a cool glance. "Sorry. I don’t accept."

Abigail’s temper flared. "Evelyn Whitmore, I apologized. What more do you want?"

"Abigail!" Margaret snapped. "Mind your tone!"

"She’s not my sister-in-law!" Abigail shot back. "I refuse to acknowledge some country girl as family! She’s just a gold-digger who tricked Nathaniel into marriage!"

"How dare you!" Margaret raised her hand, but couldn’t bring herself to strike her.

Abigail, emboldened, sneered. "It’s the truth! She’s nothing but a scheming—"

Margaret trembled with fury. "You—!"

Worried for her health, Evelyn stepped in, rubbing Margaret’s back soothingly. "Grandma, don’t upset yourself. I’ll let it go—but I won’t forgive her."
###Chapter 77

"Evelyn, my dear. For my sake, can you—" Margaret still hoped she could mediate between the two.

But Evelyn stood firm. "Grandma, this isn't the first time. Last time, she dragged you to the art gallery to catch me in some fabricated affair. Now, she’s accusing me of being an escort and hurling insults at me. I can’t keep forgiving someone who repeatedly humiliates me. And she’s never once apologized sincerely. I hope you understand, Grandma."

Margaret sighed helplessly. She understood Evelyn’s anger—no woman would tolerate such slander. Abigail had crossed the line, not once, but twice.

‘Abigail… She’s been spoiled rotten. It’s time she learned some manners, but she’s so fragile… Sigh. At least Evelyn said she’d let it go.’

Abigail smirked, confident her grandmother wouldn’t punish her. ‘So what if I insulted you? Grandma won’t do a thing about it!’

"Apologize. Now." Nathaniel’s voice cut through the room like ice, sharp and unyielding.

The atmosphere plummeted. The staff froze—rarely did the young master speak so harshly to his sister. Clearly, he was furious on his wife’s behalf.

Abigail paled. "Nathaniel, why are you taking her side? She must’ve poisoned you against me!"

Nathaniel’s gaze was calm but unrelenting. "You insulted her. You will apologize."

Evelyn glanced at him, surprised. ‘He’s actually being fair… Not defending his sister just because she’s family.’

Abigail’s eyes welled with frustrated tears. "I won’t—"

"Now." Nathaniel’s tone left no room for defiance.

She flinched. She could push Margaret’s patience, but never Nathaniel’s.

Gritting her teeth, she bowed stiffly. "I’m sorry."

Evelyn didn’t acknowledge her. Instead, she turned to Margaret. "Grandma, I need to pick up my things from the station. Don’t wait for me for dinner."

Margaret’s heart ached—she’d failed to rein in her granddaughter. "Let me come with you."

Evelyn considered it, then nodded. "Alright. We can grab dinner afterward—my treat."

Margaret smiled warmly. "Nonsense. I’ll treat you."

Hand in hand, they left, their bond unshaken.

Abigail seethed. "She ignored me after I apologized! Nathaniel, are you just going to let her—"

"No dinner for you tonight. Reflect on what you’ve done." Nathaniel shot her a cold look before following Evelyn and Margaret.

Abigail clenched her fists. ‘Why are they all siding with her? I hate her! I need to find out what went wrong at the station—how did she escape?’

She remembered vividly—Edward had knocked Evelyn out and taken her to that hotel. He’d locked her in with that repulsive man. So how had she returned home unscathed?

Something had gone terribly wrong. And Abigail would uncover the truth—no matter what it took.
###Chapter 78

Evelyn gripped the steering wheel tightly as she trailed their car to the police station.

Inside the station.

The officer handed Evelyn her recovered items. "Please verify if this wallet and phone belong to you. Check thoroughly for any missing contents."

Evelyn examined both carefully. "Yes, these are mine. Everything's accounted for."

"Sign here," the officer instructed. "Be more cautious next time. Not everyone gets this lucky."

"Understood. Thank you," Evelyn replied with a grateful smile.

Margaret stood beside her like a proper lady, praising the officers' efficiency. "Your dedication is truly commendable."

Nathaniel's imposing figure loomed nearby. He'd just ended a call, his stormy gaze fixed on how naturally Evelyn interacted with his grandmother.

The process concluded smoothly. Evelyn linked arms with Margaret as they exited, discussing dinner options.

"Where would you like to eat, Grandma?"

"Anything you prefer, dear," Margaret beamed. "This is your treat after all."

Evelyn glanced at Nathaniel. "Any preferences? My treat."

His lips curved. "You're letting me choose?"

"Go ahead," she challenged.

"How about The Celestial Bloom? Their Wagyu is exceptional."

Evelyn's smile froze. The Michelin-starred restaurant's prices could bankrupt her.

'He's testing me,' she thought.

She turned to Margaret instead. "Grandma, do you enjoy spicy food? I know an authentic Thai place."

Margaret clapped excitedly. "Perfect! Let's go there."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. 'She asked for my opinion just to disregard it? Does she really think I'd make her pay?'

As they reached the exit, Abigail came rushing toward them.

Margaret gasped. "Abigail?"

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "I told you to reflect at home. What are you doing here?"

Abigail ignored her grandmother's questioning look. Only Nathaniel's disapproval made her hesitate.
###Chapter 79

Abigail didn't dare reveal her real purpose for coming to the police station. She feared Nathaniel and Margaret would interfere.

She walked past them with determined steps, heading straight for the front desk.

"Officer, I'd like to inquire about a man and woman detained for illegal activities at the Grayson International Hotel?"

The officer studied her before answering, "Yes, we have such detainees. May I ask why?"

Abigail leaned forward. "Could I see the woman? I believe I know her!"

This didn't add up. Evelyn should be the one in custody, yet she'd returned home unharmed. Abigail needed visual confirmation.

The officer shook his head. "The female suspect escaped during arrest. My colleagues are still searching."

'Of course she ran!' Abigail thought triumphantly.

Her eyes gleamed with vindication. "I have crucial information! I know where she is!"

The officer frowned. "This isn't a joking matter, miss."

Without hesitation, Abigail turned and grabbed Evelyn, who stood quietly beside Margaret.

"Officer, here's your fugitive! Compare her to your suspect's description!"

Margaret gasped. "Abigail! Have you lost your mind?"

Abigail remained adamant. "Grandmother, you'll see the truth soon enough!"

The officer scrutinized Evelyn carefully. "I wasn't present during the arrest, but she matches the description - same clothing, height, and build."

Smug satisfaction spread across Abigail's face. "No doubt remains. Arrest her immediately! She fabricated that robbery story to cover her tracks!"

Nathaniel stormed over, his voice dangerously low. "Haven't you caused enough chaos today?"

Abigail stood her ground. "I'm exposing Evelyn's true nature! Stop letting her deceive you!"

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "Lucas, take my sister home now."

"Yes, sir!" Lucas moved toward Abigail.

She dodged behind the officer. "I'm not leaving until Evelyn's arrested!"

Nathaniel gave Lucas a meaningful look before wrapping a protective arm around Evelyn's shoulders.

The officer blocked their path. "Sir, she can't leave yet."

Nathaniel's eyes turned glacial. "Explain."

"We must verify this new information," the officer said, his suspicion growing. "Miss Whitmore needs to stay for questioning."

Abigail crowed in triumph. "See? Even the police find her suspicious!"

Nathaniel studied Evelyn's calm face, his gaze unreadable.
###Chapter 80

Evelyn Whitmore maintained her composure, offering Nathaniel Grayson a sardonic smile. "What's the matter? Do you think I'm suspicious too?"

Nathaniel's lips curved slightly. "Suspicious of what? That you'd sell yourself to some lowlife as a graduation gift?"

Evelyn blinked, momentarily caught off guard, before rolling her eyes. Is he seriously joking right now? Doesn't he see the situation I'm in? Unless... he doesn't actually suspect me?

She ignored Nathaniel and turned to the officer. "Sir, what do you need from me to cooperate with the investigation?"

The policeman gave her a stern look. "Come with me."

"Evelyn—" Margaret Grayson reached out, gripping Evelyn's arm with concern.

Evelyn offered her a regretful smile. "I'm sorry, Grandma. Looks like I won't be able to take you to dinner tonight."

Margaret paled. "Evelyn, are you really—?"

Without another word, Evelyn followed the officer to the interrogation room at the back.

As she passed Abigail Grayson, the younger woman smirked triumphantly. "Evelyn Whitmore, did you really think coming home and pretending nothing happened would save you? Justice always catches up. You can fool everyone else, but not me!"

Evelyn paused, meeting Abigail's gaze calmly. "Abigail, how are you so certain I'm the escort? Do you have proof? Why don't you share it with the officer?"

A flicker of guilt crossed Abigail's face before she scoffed. "I didn't see it myself, but my instincts never lie. Still denying it? I can't wait to see your face when they confirm everything!"

Evelyn said nothing else. Lowering her head, she followed the officer inside.

Abigail, satisfied with how things were unfolding, grinned. "Nathaniel, Grandma, just wait. The real Evelyn Whitmore is about to be exposed!"

After enduring two shocking incidents in one day, Margaret looked unwell. Lucas Sinclair guided her to a bench in the waiting area before approaching Nathaniel.

"Sir, should I inform Chief Thomas about Miss Evelyn?"

Nathaniel's expression was unreadable, his emotions hidden behind an icy mask.

"Sir?" Lucas repeated when he received no response.

Nathaniel turned and walked outside. Lighting a cigarette with practiced ease, he exhaled slowly. "Leave her be. If she's guilty, she'll face the consequences. If not, the police won't hold her."

Lucas nodded. "Understood."

Abigail was thrilled by her brother's indifference. Perfect. Nathaniel isn't lifting a finger to help her. She's done for!

Ten minutes later, Evelyn emerged from the interrogation room, the previously stern officer now apologizing profusely as he escorted her back.

Abigail's smile faltered. She rushed forward. "Officer, what happened? She is the escort from the Celestial Bloom Hotel, isn't she?"

The officer shook his head. "After thorough verification, Miss Whitmore has no connection to the case you reported."

"What? No connection?!" Abigail's voice rose in disbelief. "Did you even check properly? She's the one! How is she not involved? Did she bribe you in there?"

The officer's expression darkened. "Miss, I can assure you we've apprehended the actual suspect. Miss Whitmore's identification was stolen and used by criminals to book the room. The clothing similarity was coincidental. That's all there is to it."

Abigail opened her mouth to argue, but the sudden blare of a police siren outside cut her off.

Frowning, she turned toward the entrance—then froze.

The woman being escorted in was not Evelyn.

Abigail's face drained of color. "No! That's not her! She's not the escort!"
###Chapter 81

Evelyn turned to face Abigail, her finger pointing accusingly. "You! This is another one of your schemes! You must have hired this woman to impersonate me!"

Nathaniel's grandmother Margaret gasped in shock.

Evelyn spread her hands wide in innocence. "Abigail, will you only be satisfied if I'm the escort like you wanted?"

Abigail's face twisted in anger. "What do you mean, like I wanted? You are the escort!"

A sharp slap echoed through the police station as Margaret struck her granddaughter across the face.

"You disgraceful girl!" Margaret panted, her hand still raised. "After the scene at home, now you're causing trouble here? Evelyn is your sister-in-law! How dare you humiliate her like this!"

Abigail touched her stinging cheek in disbelief. "Grandmother... you hit me? You've never laid a hand on me before!" Tears welled in her eyes.

Margaret's expression softened momentarily before hardening again. "I should have disciplined you sooner! Apologize to Evelyn immediately!"

"I won't apologize!" Abigail screamed hysterically. "She's the escort! Evelyn Whitmore sold herself at that hotel!"

Before anyone could react, Abigail lunged at Evelyn, her hands closing around her throat. "Admit it! Admit you're that cheap whore from the hotel!"

Evelyn choked, unable to speak as Abigail shook her violently.

Officers rushed forward. "Stop! This is a police station!"

Margaret nearly collapsed from distress. "Abigail, stop this madness!"

Nathaniel entered just then, catching his grandmother before she fell. His voice cut through the chaos like ice. "Release her. Now."

Normally terrified of her brother, Abigail stood her ground this time. "Nathaniel, you can't marry this woman!"

His expression darkened dangerously. "I won't say it again."

Abigail immediately released Evelyn, cowering under Nathaniel's glare.

Nathaniel passed Margaret to Lucas before striding to Evelyn. He tilted her chin up, examining the red marks on her neck. "Are you stupid?" he hissed. "Why didn't you defend yourself?"

Evelyn scowled. "Oh wonderful, now I'm being blamed for being attacked! Typical Grayson logic - punish the victim!"

Nathaniel's tension eased slightly at her sharp retort. He pinched her cheek. "Still got that sharp tongue, I see."

Evelyn rubbed her face indignantly. "First choking, now pinching? I stand by my statement - unreasonable, the lot of you!"

Nathaniel actually chuckled, ruffling her hair before turning his glare back to Abigail. "Go home. Now."

Abigail whimpered, "Nathaniel—"

But he'd already turned away, his attention solely on Evelyn's injuries. "Does it hurt?" he asked quietly.

"Not as much as your pinching," Evelyn muttered.

The corner of Nathaniel's mouth twitched. "Be more careful next time."

Evelyn rolled her eyes and turned away.

Abigail watched this exchange with growing fury. Nathaniel had never shown such patience with any woman before. Her hatred for Evelyn burned hotter.

'This isn't over,' Abigail vowed silently.

As Lucas helped Margaret outside with Abigail following, two officers escorted a handcuffed Edward Whitmore into the station. Spotting Abigail, the man lunged forward desperately.

"Mrs. Grayson! Oh thank heavens! Please, you have to help me!"

Abigail paled, avoiding his gaze. "You're mistaken! I don't know you!"
###Chapter 82

Edward Whitmore's jaw dropped as Abigail Grayson suddenly turned on him. "Mrs. Grayson! How could you betray me like this? You're the reason I got arrested!"

"You've mistaken me for someone else! I don't know you! Get your hands off me!" Abigail recoiled in disgust, slapping away Edward's grasping hands.

She snapped at the officers. "Why are you just standing there? Arrest this criminal already! Can't you see he's harassing me?"

With that, Abigail hurried forward to pull Margaret away. "Grandmother, let's leave. This place is crawling with dangerous people!"

Edward's face twisted in rage as the officers dragged him away. He fought against their grip. "Mrs. Grayson! You're going to pretend you don't know me after using me? Fine! You leave me no choice!"

He turned to the nearest officer. "I want to report her! She's the one who orchestrated everything! She's the mastermind!"

All eyes turned to Abigail.

"Grandmother, that man's clearly insane. Let's go!" Abigail forced calm into her voice, desperate to escape.

But Margaret hesitated. Something felt wrong. She turned to the officers. "What exactly is this man being arrested for?"

"Ma'am, we caught him installing hidden cameras in a hotel room to spy on guests. It's a serious privacy violation," one officer explained.

Edward had originally wanted to impress "Mrs. Grayson" to secure investment from Nathaniel. He'd planned to frame Evelyn Whitmore as an escort. For his own sick pleasure, he'd installed cameras to record the whole thing.

Luckily, police had stormed in before anything could happen.

Margaret's expression darkened as she studied Edward. After a long moment, she turned to her granddaughter. "Abigail. Do you or do you not know this man?"

Abigail's eyes darted nervously. "I-I swear I don't! He's clearly delusional! He's got the wrong person!"

Edward saw red at her continued denials. If he was going down, he'd take her with him.

"Mrs. Grayson, I'm amazed you can lie so shamelessly! Weren't you the one who gave me Evelyn's location today? You helped me drug her and bring her to Grayson International Hotel to frame her!"

Abigail went deathly pale. "You're lying! I did no such thing!"

After previous scandals, Margaret had developed a stronger constitution. She pressed a hand to her chest and took a steadying breath. "Why do you keep calling her Mrs. Grayson?"

Edward looked confused. "Isn't she Nathaniel Grayson's wife? I met her at the Grayson estate gates. She told me she was Nathaniel's wife and wanted help ruining his mistress, Evelyn Whitmore!"

Abigail shook violently. "Grandmother, don't listen to him! It's not true!"

Margaret closed her eyes. She never imagined her beloved granddaughter capable of such treachery. If not for Lucas Sinclair's supporting arm, she might have collapsed.

"Who exactly is my mistress?" Nathaniel's deep voice cut through the tension.

He stepped forward, his striking features and commanding presence instantly drawing all attention.

Edward paled. "M-Mr. Grayson! You're here too!"

Nathaniel repeated coldly, "Who did you say was my mistress?"

At that moment, Evelyn stepped out from behind Nathaniel, looking petite beside his tall frame. She stifled a yawn, exhausted from the day's events.

Edward's eyes bulged. "Evelyn?! But you're supposed to be—"

Evelyn leaned sleepily against Nathaniel's arm, raising an eyebrow. "Supposed to be what? Getting arrested as an escort?"

Nathaniel glanced down at Evelyn using his arm as a pillow, his expression unreadable.
###Chapter 83

The way Evelyn and Nathaniel interacted made it clear they had a connection. It wasn’t the kind of sweet, lovey-dovey relationship people might expect, but there was something undeniable between them.

Did Nathaniel actually save her? Edward thought, his face twisting in disbelief. His mind raced. Did she actually climb her way up from being just his mistress?

Evelyn lifted her chin, her eyes flashing with defiance as she turned to the man beside her. "Nathaniel, did you hear him call me your mistress? What are you going to do about that?"

Her tone was playful, almost childlike, but there was an edge to it that made Nathaniel smirk. He studied her for a moment before shifting his gaze to Edward, his expression turning cold.

"Who did you just call a mistress?" Nathaniel's voice was dangerously soft. "Say it again."

Edward swallowed hard, his confidence crumbling. "Uh… her. Isn’t she?"

Lucas stepped forward, his tone firm. "For the record, Miss Evelyn is Mr. Grayson’s legally wedded wife. The only Mrs. Grayson."

What?! Edward felt the blood drain from his face.

That meant—everything he’d seen—Evelyn and Nathaniel in the car, their shared meals—none of it was some illicit affair. They were married. And he had just insulted the wife of one of the most powerful men in the city.

I was wrong. Dead wrong. Panic clawed at his throat.

He was finished. Not only had he offended the real Mrs. Grayson, but he’d also tried to fire her from Alpha Enterprises. Who would’ve thought this so-called country girl was actually Nathaniel Grayson’s wife?

Edward had expected a short jail sentence for his crimes. But now? After crossing Nathaniel and Evelyn? He’d be lucky to ever see daylight again.

If the officers hadn’t been holding him up, he would’ve dropped to his knees. "Mr. Grayson, Mrs. Grayson—I’m sorry! I didn’t know! Please, forgive me! Let me go!"

Desperate, he pointed at Abigail. "It’s her! She pretended to be Mrs. Grayson! She’s the one who manipulated me into setting Evelyn up!"

Abigail’s face paled. "Shut your mouth, Edward! Don’t you dare drag me into this!"

Edward scoffed. "Oh, so now you don’t know me? Then how do you know my full name? And I still have the call logs and location you sent me!"

The officer who had questioned Evelyn earlier turned to Abigail, his expression hardening. "No wonder you were so insistent that Evelyn was the escort. You were part of this setup from the beginning."

Abigail shook her head violently. "No! That’s a lie! I didn’t do anything!"

"We’ll see about that." The officer reached for her, but Abigail shoved him away.

"Don’t touch me! Who do you think you are? Nathaniel! Grandma! Help me!"

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened, but before he could speak—

"Don’t you dare defend her, Nathaniel!" Margaret’s voice cut through the chaos.

She glared at Abigail, her disappointment palpable. "Let the police investigate. I want to know exactly what kind of person my granddaughter has become."
###Chapter 84

Evelyn was escorted into the interrogation room by the officer. The questioning lasted over twenty minutes.

When the officer stepped out, Lucas approached to gather details on behalf of the Graysons. He returned to Nathaniel and Margaret to relay what he'd learned.

"Sir, Ma'am, the police have wrapped up their investigation. Miss Abigail conspired with a man named Edward Whitmore to frame Miss Evelyn today. They found evidence of communication between them via their phones. Miss Abigail agreed to lure Miss Evelyn out to the mall, where they planned to drug her, take her to a hotel, and stage her as an escort while arranging for a man to assault her."

"By coincidence, Miss Evelyn had lost her wallet and phone earlier. Another woman wearing similar clothing found them. Edward mistakenly targeted her instead. He covered her head with a bag, knocked her unconscious, and took her to the hotel. Thankfully, it ended there."

"The client who paid for this service didn't touch the woman. The woman arrested isn't actually an escort. Regardless... Miss Abigail is being held for fifteen days for her involvement in the crime."

The news was too much for Margaret. She collapsed.

Nathaniel caught her and ordered sharply, "Call an ambulance!"

"Yes, sir!" Lucas immediately pulled out his phone.

Evelyn spoke up quietly. "No need. I already called one. It should be here any moment."

Right on cue, paramedics arrived with a stretcher. They secured Margaret, placed an oxygen mask over her face, and rushed her to the hospital.

At Nathaniel's instruction, Lucas accompanied them.

Soon, the police station returned to its usual solemn atmosphere.

Nathaniel studied Evelyn with narrowed eyes. Did she anticipate this outcome? Is that why she called the ambulance beforehand?

Evelyn felt his piercing gaze but ignored it. She approached an officer politely. "Officer, may I speak with Abigail for a moment?"

The officer looked surprised. "After what she tried to do to you?"

Evelyn smiled. "She's my husband's sister. I'll have to face her eventually. Might as well clear the air now. I'd prefer we get along in the future."

"You're very gracious, young lady." The officer had appreciated her cooperation throughout the process.

"Alright. But keep it brief."

"Thank you."

Inside the interrogation room, Abigail shot up from her chair the moment Evelyn entered. "Evelyn Whitmore! You witch! This is all your doing! You set me up!"

As a spoiled heiress, Abigail had never experienced police interrogation. The ordeal had left her frantic and furious.

The officer had handcuffed her to the table when she became uncooperative during questioning. Otherwise, she might have lunged at Evelyn.

Evelyn sat calmly across from her. She casually picked at her ear, feigning annoyance at Abigail's shouting. "No, this was your plan. I just outplayed you at your own game."
###Chapter 85

Abigail was seething with rage, her words catching in her throat. She clenched her fists so hard her nails dug into her palms. "You're still that vile, two-faced snake! Playing the innocent angel around Nathaniel and Grandmother while scheming behind their backs!"

Evelyn's lips curled into a mocking smile. "So I'm both a saint and a sinner? How fascinating. People see what they deserve to see, Abigail. Maybe you should reflect on your own actions before pointing fingers."

The contrast was striking - Evelyn's delicate features could morph from angelic sweetness to devilish menace in a heartbeat, making those who crossed her pay dearly.

A shiver ran down Abigail's spine. "Monster! You're an absolute monster!"

Evelyn arched one perfect eyebrow. "I become whatever you make me. Though I did warn you, didn't I? 'Don't test me' were my exact words. But you just had to push your luck."

Defeat settled over Abigail, but confusion still gnawed at her. "How? I saw Edward bring you to that hotel myself!"

Leaning back with feline grace, Evelyn chuckled. "My mentor taught me one golden rule: Never strike first, but always be prepared when others do. Your sudden shopping invitation reeked of deception from mile away. Did you really think I'd fall for such an obvious trap?" She waved a dismissive hand. "The how isn't important. Some magic tricks lose their charm when explained."

Truthfully, Evelyn had hoped for peaceful coexistence during these three months. Less drama meant fewer headaches. But Sebastian, ever vigilant, had noticed Edward lurking near the Grayson estate for days and put him under surveillance. When Abigail's communications with Edward surfaced, Sebastian alerted Evelyn immediately.

Every move had been anticipated and countered. The decoy who resembled Evelyn? Sebastian's doing from start to finish.

For Margaret's sake, Evelyn had given Abigail every chance to back down. Any moment before the final betrayal could have stopped this disaster.

But Abigail chose to brand Evelyn as some cheap escort. The consequences were hers alone to bear.

"You'll pay for this, Evelyn Whitmore!" Abigail spat. "My brother would never love a deceitful witch like you!"

Evelyn stretched lazily. "Perfect. The feeling's mutual - I've no interest in your emotionally constipated brother either."

"What? You're lying!" Abigail's eyes bulged. "If you don't love him, why marry him? Such hypocrisy!"

"Marry him by choice?" Evelyn snorted. "Your brother might be every socialite's fantasy, but to me? Sure, he's aesthetically pleasing, if you're into human ice sculptures. Half the time I forget he's capable of speech. Honestly, we'd get more conversation from decorating the house with actual statues."

Abigail gaped as if Evelyn had grown a second head. "Y-You dare insult Nathaniel like that? Aren't you afraid he'll divorce you?"

Evelyn clasped her hands in mock prayer. "That would be my dream come true! The day Nathaniel divorces me, I'll throw a charity gala, take a purification bath, and probably skip down the aisle singing hallelujah."

The terrifying part? Abigail could tell Evelyn meant every word.

A woman who didn't worship Nathaniel? Impossible! With his godlike looks, impeccable pedigree, and staggering wealth, how could Evelyn possibly reject him?

Outside the interrogation room door, Nathaniel stood frozen, every word carving deeper into his stony expression. His jaw clenched tight enough to crack walnuts, storm clouds gathering in his piercing gaze.
###Chapter 86

Evelyn's playful expression vanished as she locked eyes with Abigail. The time for games was over.

"I'm only telling you this because I want you to stop wasting your energy trying to kick me out. When our agreement ends, I'll leave without hesitation. Even if you beg me to stay, I won't."

Abigail blinked in confusion. "Agreement? What are you talking about?"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "You really don't know? Your brother only married me to appease your grandfather's health condition. In three months, when his condition stabilizes, this marriage ends. Then you can parade any woman you want as your sister-in-law."

Abigail's face twisted with disbelief. "Why should I trust you'll actually leave? I know your type - always scheming to stay close to Nathaniel!"

A cold smile played on Evelyn's lips. "Miss Grayson, are you deaf or just dense? Your precious brother isn't my type! Frankly, I can't wait to be rid of him! These three months can't pass quickly enough!"

Abigail studied Evelyn's face, searching for deception.

'She doesn't seem to be lying. Could she really not want Nathaniel?'

"And if you don't want to make this separation more difficult, I suggest you keep this three-month arrangement from your grandmother. You know how she is - already planning baby names. If she finds out this marriage is temporary, she'll interfere. Understand?"

With that, Evelyn stood to leave.

She'd only revealed the truth to prevent Abigail from causing more trouble after her release. Dealing with this spoiled brat was exhausting.

Abigail's face paled as realization struck. If Evelyn never intended to stay, then all her scheming had been pointless. She'd even gotten herself arrested for nothing. What had she been thinking?

"Evelyn!" Abigail shouted.

Evelyn paused at the door. "What now?"

With her trademark haughty expression, Abigail sniffed. "Fine. I'll believe you. I won't cause trouble during these three months. Now tell them to release me!"

Evelyn smirked. "Sorry, princess. What you did was illegal. The law says fifteen days detention. Behave yourself - it'll be over before you know it."

Abigail's composure shattered. "I refuse to stay here! Get Nathaniel! He'll have me released immediately!"

Evelyn ignored the tantrum and walked out.

In the hallway, Nathaniel stood by a window deep in conversation with a senior officer. From his insignia, he was likely the Police Chief, who appeared to be apologizing profusely.

"Mr. Grayson, my deepest apologies. My officers treated your wife as a suspect and nearly arrested her! This was entirely our fault."

"The new recruits lack experience. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive them."

Nathaniel's voice was ice. "My forgiveness means little. What matters is my wife's feelings. Fortunately for your officers, she's merciful."

The Chief sighed in relief. "Indeed, Mrs. Grayson is most gracious. Still, I'll ensure they apologize personally."

Nathaniel remained silent as the Chief excused himself to take a call.

Evelyn approached with a mocking smile. "What's this? Arranging special treatment for your sister?"

Nathaniel barely glanced at her. "You presume too much. The law must take its course with Abigail."

Evelyn's eyebrows shot up. "You'd really leave her here?"

"She's an adult," Nathaniel said coldly. "Not a child. She'll face the consequences of her actions. It's the only way she'll learn."

Evelyn nodded approvingly. "Finally, a relative who doesn't coddle her!"

Stretching, she turned toward the exit. Outside, she noticed someone following closely.

She spun around to find Nathaniel right behind her. "Aren't you visiting your grandmother at the hospital?"
###Chapter 87

Nathaniel studied Evelyn intently. "Grandmother is resting comfortably now. Lucas took her home."

Evelyn gave a small nod of relief. "Good. I'm glad she's okay. I should get going then. See you later, Nathaniel."

She turned to leave.

After three steps, she spun back around with a puzzled frown. "Why are you following me?"

Nathaniel arched one perfect eyebrow. "Weren't you treating me to dinner?"

Evelyn's smile turned strained. "I said I'd treat your grandmother and let you come along. Since she's not going, neither are you."

His lips curled into a mocking smirk. "Then allow me to treat you instead. We both need to eat, don't we?"

She waved him off. "No thanks. I've got plans."

Nathaniel's gaze sharpened. "With whom?"

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Do I really need your permission?"

His stare turned glacial. "What do you think?"

'Unbelievable! This level of control is insane,' Evelyn fumed internally.

Thankfully their marriage had an expiration date. She could never tolerate this long-term.

With forced calm, she explained, "It's my graduation party. My classmates just texted about a small gathering. Probably an all-night thing."

Her tone made it clear she wasn't asking. Just informing.

Nathaniel lit a cigarette, the flame illuminating his sharp features. "You won't see these people again after graduation. Why waste time?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Because I want to! Not everything has to be 'useful.' These were my classmates. Future colleagues. Tonight's our last chance to celebrate before we scatter across the country."

His dark eyes gave nothing away. After a weighted pause, he ground out his cigarette. "Get in. I'll drive you."

She shook her head. "I'll just call a—"

Mid-sentence, she found herself unceremoniously deposited into the luxury car like a stray kitten. Sometimes Nathaniel's behavior bordered on absurd—this mix of aristocratic arrogance and inexplicable interest in her affairs.

The destination: Starlight Lounge.

"Thanks," Evelyn muttered before slipping out of the car without looking back.

The black Maybach didn't move.

The driver hesitated. "Sir, shall we return home or...?"

Nathaniel didn't answer, his gaze fixed on the club's neon entrance.

Dominic's call broke the silence.

"Nathaniel! Twilight Bar tonight?"

"Change of plans," Nathaniel said, still watching the door Evelyn had disappeared through.

"Where to?"

"Starlight Lounge."

A beat of stunned silence. "...Excuse me?" Dominic sounded like he'd swallowed his drink wrong. "Did you just say Starlight Lounge?"
###Chapter 88

The party venue was exactly the kind of place college students adored. Which made it utterly unsuitable - and frankly juvenile - for established businessmen and wealthy heirs.

Nathaniel surveyed the garish decorations with visible distaste. "Harrison," he scoffed, "since when did you develop such childish tastes? This place reeks of cheap beer and teenage hormones."

Harrison lounged on the stiff private room sofa, swirling his drink. "There's always the exit if you're unhappy."

Dominic shrugged. "We're already here. Might as well make the best of it."

Lucas approached with two crystal tumblers of aged whiskey, handing one to Harrison. Their glasses clinked softly. "Honestly, after endless nights at clubs and cigar bars, this place feels refreshing," Lucas remarked, taking an appreciative sip. "There's something charming about its unpretentiousness."

"You're not wrong," Dominic conceded, joining them.

The three raised their glasses in unison.

"To reliving our carefree student days," Dominic toasted.

Though truth be told, even during their university years, they'd never frequented such modest establishments.

Lucas peered through the glass partition. "That group across the hall looks like they're having the time of their lives. Must be graduation celebrations."

Dominic followed his gaze. "Ah, graduation season. When love blooms and hearts break in equal measure."

Lucas raised an eyebrow. "I thought graduation was notorious for breakups."

Dominic grinned knowingly. "That's only for couples going long-distance. Those staying in the same city? They're practically engagement announcements waiting to happen."

"Confessing at graduation is brilliant strategy," Dominic continued. "If she says yes - jackpot. If not? No awkward encounters since you'll never see each other again."

Lucas smirked. "Spoken like someone with experience. Did you pull this move back in our day?"

Dominic scoffed. "Please. When have I ever needed to chase women?"

Nathaniel's grip tightened imperceptibly around his glass. Graduation confessions. The memory surfaced unbidden - Evelyn this morning at New Capital University, accepting some "meaningful gift" from that boy. They'd looked entirely too comfortable together.

The ice in his whiskey clinked as the temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees.

"Those were simpler times," Dominic mused, oblivious to Nathaniel's darkening mood. "No responsibilities, no-"

"Excuse me." Nathaniel set down his untouched drink with deliberate calm.

Dominic blinked at the abrupt movement. "Everything alright?"

"Phone call," Nathaniel clipped out before striding from the room.

The hallway provided little respite from the raucous singing bleeding through thin walls. Through a carelessly left-ajar door, Nathaniel caught sight of Evelyn.

She was leaning dangerously close to some boy, their faces nearly touching as they struggled to hear each other over the noise. Just as Nathaniel's jaw clenched, the door swung shut, cutting off his view.
###Chapter 89

The closed door left everything to the imagination.

Nathaniel tilted his head to light a cigar. He exhaled slowly, leaning against the wall as smoke curled around his chiseled features.

Inside the private room.

Pulsing electronic beats and strobe lights created a chaotic party atmosphere.

"Evelyn, what are your plans after graduation?" Julian had to shout despite sitting right beside her, his voice barely audible over the music.

Evelyn straightened up, raising her voice in response. "Still figuring it out. But why are you here? You're not graduating this year."

Julian's lips curved shyly. "Well... some close friends graduated today. They invited me."

She nodded in understanding.

Truthfully, Julian had come for her. With Evelyn graduating, seeing her would become difficult. He'd been secretly in love for three years - ever since spotting her during freshman orientation.

That morning, he'd finally confessed. She'd gently refused. But he wasn't giving up. As long as Evelyn remained single, hope remained.

Julian grabbed two cocktail glasses, handing one to Evelyn. "Let's toast! Whatever you do next, I'll work twice as hard to follow your example!"

She accepted the colorful drink with a smile. "No need to make me your role model. Just focus on your own path. You'll do great!"

Their glasses clinked with a delicate chime, instantly swallowed by the pounding bass.

Evelyn raised her drink, but before the sweet liquid could touch her lips, a large hand intercepted it.

"No drinking outside, little miss."

She looked up into Nathaniel's stern face mere inches from hers.

His expression darkened at her obvious displeasure.

"Time to go home," he stated, his deep voice cutting through the noise effortlessly.

'Home? I just got here,' she fumed silently.

Evelyn frowned. "It's barely 9 PM. Didn't I tell you this was my class celebration?"

Nathaniel's brow furrowed. "Does that include underage drinking?"

She bristled. 'Controlling much? I know my limits. One cocktail with friends is hardly reckless.'

Julian, recognizing Nathaniel from earlier, quickly intervened. "Sir, it's just a light cocktail - barely any alcohol. And I'll personally ensure Evelyn gets home safely if needed."

Nathaniel's eyebrow arched. "You'll ensure her safety?"

"Absolutely!" Julian nodded earnestly. "You can leave her with me!"

A dangerous smirk played on Nathaniel's lips. "Leave her with you? And what exactly is your relationship to my fiancée?"
###Chapter 90

Nathaniel's question made Julian shift uncomfortably. "I...I'm Evelyn's classmate."

The imposing man looked down with piercing eyes. "Would any husband feel comfortable leaving his wife with a lovesick boy?"

Julian's cheeks burned crimson. His fists clenched at the insinuation. "I admire Evelyn, but I would never disrespect her! My feelings are pure!"

Nathaniel swirled the confiscated cocktail with a dangerous smirk. "Bold words, boy. Confessing to my wife right in front of me?"

Julian's ears turned scarlet with mortification.

Seeing her friend's distress, Evelyn stood abruptly. "Nathaniel, I won't drink anymore. Will you please leave now?"

Dark eyes locked onto hers. "Throwing me out?"

"Not throwing," she corrected through gritted teeth. "Politely asking. You're scaring everyone."

A muscle twitched in Nathaniel's jaw. Scaring them? Since when was he some monster?

The music suddenly cut off. A gaggle of starstruck girls rushed forward.

"Oh my god! You're the benefactor who donated the science building!"

"Evelyn! He's even more gorgeous up close!"

"Introduce us! Who is this Adonis?"

Their giggles filled the room as they openly ogled Nathaniel.

His smirk returned as he glanced at Evelyn. "Doesn't seem very scared to me."

She wanted to strangle her traitorous classmates.

One bold girl stepped forward. "Please stay! We should properly thank you for your generosity!"

The others chorused their agreement, batting eyelashes shamelessly.

Nathaniel's gaze never left Evelyn's exasperated face. "Another time. I just came to check on my wife."

His large hand descended on Evelyn's head, ruffling her hair like a misbehaving child. The possessive gesture made her scowl while the other girls sighed enviously.

"Have fun," he murmured. "I'll be across the hall. Come find me when you're done."

Leaning down, his lips brushed her ear as he whispered, "Remember your position, Mrs. Grayson. Wives don't cozy up to other men."

The veiled threat hung between them.

Before Evelyn could retort, Nathaniel addressed the room with polished charm. "Enjoy your party. Everything's on Evelyn tonight."

Her classmates erupted in cheers as the infuriating man made his exit.
###Chapter 91

"Wow, seriously?"

"Thank you, Evelyn!"

"Yeah, thanks! You're way too generous!"

Evelyn's eyes widened as she shot Nathaniel a look of equal parts shock and fury. Damn him! What the hell is wrong with him? Does he seriously expect me to pay for everyone here? Splitting the bill is standard for student gatherings, and there are over a hundred people. Does he even realize how much this will cost?

A faint smirk tugged at Nathaniel's lips when he saw Evelyn's stunned expression. He withdrew his hand from her head, slipped it into his trouser pocket, and turned gracefully to leave.

The moment he was gone, the room buzzed with admiration for Evelyn's apparent generosity. The girls swarmed her, peppering her with questions about the handsome man who had just left. Evelyn brushed them off with vague answers.

Meanwhile, the male students kept their distance. Knowing that someone connected to the university's most stunning woman was in the private room across the hall, they hesitated to approach—equal parts intrigued and intimidated.

Finally free from the interrogation, Evelyn sat down, fuming. She pulled out her phone and fired off a text to Nathaniel. [You’re evil, you know that?]

Half a minute later, his reply came. [Me? Evil?]

Evelyn gritted her teeth. [What was that little stunt for? Don’t you have anything better to do?]

A pause. Then: [Just marking my territory. Wouldn’t want some kid getting too close.]

She scoffed and typed back sarcastically. [Oh, so you do realize how insufferable you are!]

Across the hall, Nathaniel read her scathing message, his dark brows dipping slightly. His fingers moved swiftly over the screen. [Do you find me insufferable?]

Evelyn responded instantly—with an animated gif of a pouting little girl stomping her feet, hands on hips, captioned: I hate you.

The resemblance to Evelyn when she was annoyed was uncanny.

Dominic, watching from the side, smirked. "What’s got you smiling at your phone? You’re usually so serious—must be something good." He leaned in, trying to peek.

Nathaniel locked his screen and shot him a cold look. "I wasn’t smiling."

Dominic grinned. "Oh, you definitely were. Ask Harrison if you don’t believe me."

Nathaniel turned to Harrison, who merely sipped his wine and stayed out of it. Instead, he gestured toward the poker table. "We’ve got a game set up. You two in?"

Dominic perked up. "Hell yes. Been too long since I played. But we need a fourth."

"Gabrielle and Benjamin will be here soon."

"Perfect."

Meanwhile, Natalia watched the crowd fawning over Evelyn, her grip tightening around her guitar case. The spotlight had been stolen from her—again.

A sly smile curled her lips as an idea formed. She strode over, her expression bright and friendly. "I heard you play guitar," she said sweetly. "I’m performing an original song for our graduation. You should accompany me."
###Chapter 92

Evelyn took a slow sip of her juice through the straw, eyeing Natalia with a raised brow.

"Can't you just sing without accompaniment?"

Natalia flashed a dazzling smile. "I could, but wouldn't that be boring? Everyone wants to see me dance too!" She turned to the surrounding students. "Right, guys?"

A chorus of eager agreement rose from the male students nearby.

"Absolutely! We've never seen Natalia dance before!"

"Rumor has it she trained in ballet—she must be incredible!"

"After tonight, we might never get this chance again. A performance from her would be the perfect way to end our university years!"

Natalia basked in the attention before turning back to Evelyn with a sweetly challenging look. "See how excited they are? Why don’t we collaborate?"

Evelyn swirled her drink, unimpressed. "They're excited for your performance, not my guitar skills. Why does it have to be me?"

Natalia pouted, feigning hurt. "You're really refusing? After treating everyone so generously tonight, you won’t even help with this small favor?"

Evelyn nearly scoffed. Small favor?

"You're from the music department, Natalia. Half the people here could play for you. Why insist on me? We barely know each other."

Natalia faltered, but before she could respond, a group of her friends swooped in.

"Because you two are the most stunning girls on campus! A joint performance would be legendary!"

"Come on, Evelyn! Consider it a farewell gift to all of us!"

"Four years together deserve an unforgettable finale!"

Their enthusiasm spread like wildfire, and soon, every pair of eyes in the room was fixed on Evelyn.

She sighed. She had played guitar on stage once during sophomore year—denying she could play now would be pointless.

"Fine." She stood, taking the guitar case from Natalia. "Don’t expect brilliance. I’m no professional."

The crowd erupted in cheers.

"Of course not!"

"We’re just happy you’re doing it!"

Natalia smirked in triumph.

The party venue was massive, designed for large gatherings. The lower floor buzzed with karaoke, pool tables, and gaming consoles, while the upper level offered quieter spaces—a lounge, a study, and a beautifully lit terrace perfect for intimate conversations.

Evelyn adjusted the guitar strap, already regretting her decision.
###Chapter 93

The terrace was adorned with two artificial cherry blossom trees and lush potted plants. A small performance stage stood between them, meant for guests to showcase their musical talents.

Downstairs, the acoustics were terrible. Even with the music turned off, noise from adjacent rooms leaked through the walls. That's why the students insisted Evelyn and Natalia perform upstairs.

Natalia beamed as she handed Evelyn the sheet music. "Here's my original composition. I'm sure someone of your caliber won't have any trouble with it."

Evelyn studied the intricate score. The piece was masterfully written - far too complex for an amateur. Natalia had clearly designed this as a trap.

"Problem?" Natalia feigned concern when she noticed Evelyn's hesitation. "Too challenging for you?"

Evelyn met her gaze briefly before sighing. "It's difficult, but I'll do my best to accompany you."

Natalia's smile didn't reach her eyes. This pretentious amateur actually thought she could play her masterpiece? The composition had taken Natalia a full year to perfect, incorporating every advanced technique she'd mastered. If even she struggled with certain passages, this fraud stood no chance.

This was Natalia's revenge. For four years, Evelyn's "perfect student" act had overshadowed her. Tonight, she'd expose Evelyn's mediocrity in front of everyone.

Ten minutes later, they ascended to the terrace stage. Evelyn settled into position, arranging the music on the stand and preparing her instrument.

Her hands froze when she opened the case. This wasn't a guitar.

"Everything alright?" Natalia asked with faux concern. "Need more time?"

Evelyn's expression darkened. "You should see this."

Natalia peered into the case and gasped dramatically. "Oh dear! I must have packed my ukulele by mistake!"

The growing audience grew restless.

"What's the holdup?"
"Just start already!"
"They're both string instruments - what's the difference?" someone shouted ignorantly.

Natalia seized the opportunity. "He's right. The composition works on ukulele too. Why don't you try?"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. The "mistake" was obviously intentional, confirmed by Natalia's smug expression.

"Unless..." Natalia widened her eyes in mock surprise. "You don't actually play ukulele?"

Silence.

Natalia clasped her hands in exaggerated apology. "My mistake! I assumed our 'perfect' student could handle basic instruments. How embarrassing!"

Natalia's clique erupted in laughter.

"Get off the stage if you can't play!"
"Let Natalia perform solo!"
"Some 'perfect student' - can't even play a simple ukulele!"
"Guess all those rumors about you were just lies!"
###Chapter 94

"Get off the stage if you can't play, Evelyn! Let Natalia handle the performance alone!"

"Yeah, leave! We've waited long enough—stop wasting everyone's time!"

Natalia finally felt she'd successfully stolen the spotlight back from Evelyn. Pride swelled in her chest, though she made sure to plaster on a sympathetic expression.

"If that's how it is, I won't force you. Why don't you step down? I'll handle the performance myself."

"Fine." Evelyn nodded without hesitation. She had no interest in performing for Natalia anyway. The moment she set down the ukulele and left the stage, whispers erupted from Natalia's clique in the front row.

"Pathetic. Can't even play a simple instrument—what's so special about her?"

"If she's from such a wealthy family, I bet her academic records are fake too. Money can buy any reputation!"

"Her? Wealthy? When I was organizing files last week, I saw Evelyn's records. She grew up dirt poor in some village! Had to rely on scholarships just to attend university!"

"Wait—a scholarship student? Then how could her family afford to donate an entire building today?"

"You really think that's her family? Please. She obviously found some sugar daddy in the city with that pretty face of hers. Country girls will do anything for money."

"Sugar daddy? You mean that gorgeous man earlier? He's raising her?"

"Obviously! Did you think someone that young could be her real father? Pfft. They're definitely sleeping together—no man helps a girl like that without ulterior motives."

"Oh! And get this—I heard from upperclassmen that Evelyn spends hours alone in the dean's office. Suspicious, don't you think? Why else would he let her speak at graduation?"

"Ew! The dean's old enough to be her grandfather!"

"So what? Men are all the same—"

Evelyn's expression darkened as she strode toward the gossiping girls.

"What did you just say about the dean?"

The group flinched when Evelyn confronted them, but quickly regained their composure. "What's it to you? You heard us."

Evelyn's voice turned icy. "The dean dedicated his life to education. How dare you disrespect him with your filthy rumors?"

One girl crossed her arms defiantly. "We can say whatever we want. Freedom of speech!"

"Yeah! Exactly!"

"Why so defensive? Hitting a nerve, are we?"

Evelyn grabbed the ringleader's collar. "Say that again. I dare you."

The girl paled but refused to back down. "Planning to hit me? That'll just prove we're right!"

Evelyn released her with a cold smile. "I won't stoop to your level. But you will apologize publicly for slandering the dean."

The girl straightened her shirt with a sneer. "Make us. Unless... you can prove you're actually talented and not just the dean's favorite."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "How?"

"Play the ukulele properly. Then we'll believe you earned your spot here—and didn't sleep your way to the top."
###Chapter 95

The moment Evelyn opened her mouth to respond, the surrounding girls erupted in mocking laughter.

"Cat got your tongue? Can't even play a simple instrument?"

"Stop pretending to be the perfect student if you can't back it up!"

"If you can't even handle a ukulele, everyone will know your 'genius' reputation was just the dean's favoritism. Who'd believe there's nothing shady between you two?"

Evelyn never claimed to be some prodigy. The dean had taken a liking to her mathematical brilliance, constantly praising her work. Their frequent office meetings? Simply discussions about advanced equations where the esteemed professor often sought her insights, setting aside his seniority to learn from her.

A pure academic relationship twisted into something sordid by petty minds. The dean was one of the few who made her university life bearable. She wouldn't let them smear his reputation—or hers.

"Fine." Evelyn's voice cut through the jeers. "I'll play."

The crowd burst into fresh ridicule.

"Don't embarrass yourself further!"

"You just ran off stage! Nobody's buying this sudden confidence!"

"Remember—actual music, not random strumming! We know the difference!"

Across the balcony, Benjamin Rivers swirled his sparkling water, too young to join Nathaniel and Dominic's poker game. His bored gaze landed on the commotion below.

"Well, well. If it isn't the insufferable Evelyn Whitmore." He nudged his companion. "Look, Maxwell—Nathaniel's so-called wife getting roasted by her own classmates."

Maxwell peeked over. "That does appear to be Mrs. Grayson—"

Benjamin's palm smacked the back of his head. "Mrs. Grayson? Never! My sister Amelia is the only woman worthy of Nathaniel! This country bumpkin's just a placeholder!"

Rubbing his head, Maxwell sighed. "Yes, sir. My mistake..."

Benjamin's smirk widened as he watched the scene unfold. "See how everyone hates her? Proves she's the problem."

Maxwell hesitated. "Actually, those girls seem to be bullying—OW!" Benjamin's kick silenced him.

"Whose side are you on?" Benjamin glowered. "I declare her guilty—end of discussion!"

Near tears, Maxwell nodded. "As you say, sir."

"Better." Benjamin's eyes gleamed. "Now fetch Nathaniel and the others. Let's watch the peasant humiliate herself. No way this backwater girl can play."

Maxwell hesitated but feared another assault. With a resigned nod, he hurried off—praying this wouldn't backfire spectacularly.
###Chapter 96

Natalia's clique kept taunting Evelyn.

"Fine! If you can perform a song right now and get a standing ovation from everyone here, we'll consider it your win! Not only will we apologize—we'll do whatever you ask!"

Evelyn remained unfazed. "Deal."

The ringleader smirked and added, "But if you butcher it and don't get unanimous approval, you'll crawl out of this room while we film it and post it online. Still in?"

Evelyn hesitated for a beat, then nodded. "Deal."

The girl scoffed. "Then what are you waiting for? Don't cry when you lose."

Evelyn turned, stepped onto the stage, and took the ukulele from Natalia.

Natalia feigned concern. "You should quit while you're ahead. Reputation matters—imagine crawling out of here in front of everyone."

Evelyn arched a brow. "How do you know I'll lose before I've even started?"

Natalia smirked. "The ukulele isn't easy. The fingerings are brutal. I'd hate for you to embarrass yourself."

"Thanks for the warning." Evelyn ignored her and tuned the instrument calmly before glancing up. "Weren't you supposed to sing and dance? Ready?"

Natalia barely suppressed a sneer. She hadn't actually wanted Evelyn to back out—she was dying to see the arrogant country girl humiliate herself.

After another insincere warning, Natalia positioned herself center stage, adjusting the mic. She had no intention of performing seriously. She was certain Evelyn would fail, forcing her to sing solo again.

As the crowd watched eagerly, Evelyn plucked the strings—but instead of music, a chaotic, grating noise erupted.

The audience winced.

"God, I thought she could actually play!"

"Where does she get the confidence? This is painful!"

"She's just hitting random strings! It's awful!"

"She's ruining Natalia's ukulele!"

Natalia and her friends stifled laughter. This was exactly what they wanted—Evelyn's reputation in tatters, the myth of the "perfect student" shattered.

Soon, they'd film her crawling out in disgrace.

Across the terrace, a group of strikingly attractive onlookers watched.

Benjamin burst out laughing. "Nathaniel, your wife's massacring that song! How embarrassing!"

Gabrielle smirked, eyes gleaming with contempt. Of course she'd fail. A country bumpkin could never grasp real artistry.

Harrison observed impassively.

Dominic sighed and slung an arm around Nathaniel's shoulders. "Looks like your bride's got no rhythm."

Nathaniel's lips curved slightly. "You think so?"

Dominic raised a brow. "What's there to doubt? She's butchering it!"

Then—abruptly—the discordant noise transformed into a smooth, mesmerizing melody.

Dominic whipped his head around, expecting someone else had taken over.

But no. It was still Evelyn, fingers dancing effortlessly over the strings.
###Chapter 97

Evelyn had been toying with them all along!

Her previously clumsy fingers now moved with practiced precision across the ukulele strings. The melody flowing from her instrument was unmistakably the same score Natalia had given her earlier.

The audience's expressions shifted dramatically - from initial disgust to confusion, then finally to awe and admiration.

Natalia and her clique stood frozen in shock.

None of them anticipated Evelyn could play this well. The tables had turned completely. Sensing the momentum shift, Natalia's friends quickly rallied behind her.

"Don't just stand there, Natalia! Sing!"

"Use your voice to overpower Evelyn!"

"Don't forget to dance!"

Jolted by their encouragement, Natalia snapped into action. She began singing and dancing to the rhythm, pouring all her energy into stealing back the audience's attention.

For a moment, it worked. Some classmates turned their gaze toward her, prompting Natalia to dance even more vigorously.

Then Evelyn accelerated her tempo.

Her fingers flew across the strings with impossible speed and accuracy - far beyond any beginner's capability. This was professional-level playing, maintaining perfect pitch and rhythm even at breakneck speed.

Natalia struggled to keep up. Her breathing grew ragged as she attempted to match the accelerating tempo while dancing. The strain proved too much.

With an undignified thud, she collapsed on stage.

The audience erupted.

"How does someone trip during their own song? It's like she doesn't know it well."

"Natalia sounds winded, but Evelyn plays amazingly!"

"Exactly! Evelyn truly deserves her reputation as the top all-around student. She's not even in music, yet plays like a pro!"

Evelyn stopped playing when Natalia fell.

Glancing at the struggling girl, she addressed the crowd. "Natalia's composition has a modern style. While playable on ukulele, it doesn't showcase the instrument's strengths. May I perform something more suitable?"

"Yes!"

"Please do!"

"We're listening!"

Evelyn smiled. "I'll play an instrumental version of 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' as my graduation gift to you all. Forgive any mistakes."

Her fingers coaxed forth a delicate, haunting melody that perfectly captured youthful hope and resilience. Each note resonated with emotional depth, blending strength and tenderness in perfect harmony.

When the final chord faded, stunned silence gripped the audience.

Then came the first crisp clap from the opposite terrace.

Evelyn turned - and nearly dropped her ukulele. 'Nathaniel? How long has he been watching?'

There he stood, his tall frame unmistakable. His applause was measured yet powerful, his devastatingly handsome face wearing an expression that mingled admiration with amusement.

'His friends are here too? Were they all watching me?'

Most noticeable was Benjamin, who'd been staring dazedly before suddenly glaring at her with unexpected venom.

"Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant!" Dominic Prescott cheered enthusiastically, sparking a thunderous standing ovation that shook the entire terrace.
###Chapter 98

"Evelyn has proven she's the ultimate all-rounder! Her ukulele skills surpass even some music majors!"

"I'm officially a believer now. No more doubts about her abilities!"

"Same here! No wonder she's legendary. Dean's favoritism makes total sense!"

The auditorium erupted in applause as Evelyn finished her performance. Every single student was on their feet, cheering wildly.

Across the room, Natalia and her clique wore expressions like they'd swallowed lemons.

Evelyn set down the instrument with deliberate care. She strode to center stage, locking eyes with her challengers. "Your turn. Public apology to the dean. Now."

The ringleader gaped. "H-How can an engineering student play like that?"

Evelyn shrugged. "Picked it up in my free time."

The girl's face twisted. "'Picked it up'? That was professional-level—"

"Better than who, exactly?" Evelyn arched one perfect eyebrow.

The girl clamped her mouth shut, refusing to voice the compliment dangling on her tongue.

Evelyn crossed her arms. "I held up my end. Time for you to honor our agreement."

The group huddled together, whispering furiously. Their reluctance was palpable.

"Stop stalling! Apologize already!"

"Made the challenge, now pay up!"

"Get on with it!"

Under mounting peer pressure, the girls slunk onto the stage. "We... apologize to Evelyn and Dean Whitmore. Our comments were unfounded and inappropriate." Their insincere mumbles barely carried past the first row.

The crowd's murmurs turned judgmental. Evelyn had already tuned them out, massaging her temples as she exited the stifling auditorium.

She'd only attended this reunion to maintain appearances for Nathaniel's sake. Who knew a simple ukulele would cause such drama?

"Evelyn! Wait!"

She turned to find Natalia charging toward her, clutching the instrument like a weapon. "You're not leaving until you pay for damaging my ukulele!"

Evelyn blinked. "It was fine when I played it."

Natalia thrust it forward. "Look closer! These scratches weren't here before! This is a vintage piece worth thousands!"

The sweet facade had cracked completely. Natalia's true colors—petty jealousy and wounded pride—shone through.

Evelyn examined the alleged damage. "Name your price."

"Fifteen thousand. Consider it a friends-and-family discount." Natalia's saccharine smile didn't reach her venomous eyes.
###Chapter 99

Evelyn let out a mocking laugh. "Fifteen thousand? As your fellow graduate, Natalia, do you really think I'm that gullible?"

Natalia sneered back. "But I thought your family was loaded, Evelyn. If you can donate an entire building to our alma mater, surely you can afford a simple ukulele?"

Evelyn's eyes narrowed dangerously. "What if I refuse?"

"Then don't blame me when the police get involved!" Natalia's face turned crimson as she jabbed a finger toward Evelyn. "Your fingerprints are all over this instrument, and dozens of witnesses saw you handling it earlier. You won't wriggle out of this one!"

With an indifferent shrug, Evelyn recognized this for what it was - petty revenge after Natalia's earlier humiliation. The whole charade reeked of desperation.

"Call them then! Let the authorities determine if this so-called antique is worth fifteen thousand. While they're at it, they can decide whether your behavior constitutes extortion."

Natalia's confident facade cracked. Her cheeks flushed with panic at Evelyn's unexpected counter. "You scheming little—"

"Who's the real schemer here?" Evelyn cut in smoothly. "The one demanding outrageous compensation? Or the one being framed?"

"That doesn't matter! You damaged my property!" Natalia's voice turned shrill as she physically blocked Evelyn's path. "You're not leaving until you pay!"

Evelyn could practically see the gears turning in Natalia's mind - if she couldn't humiliate Evelyn publicly, she'd at least extort money from her. The scratches were clearly self-inflicted, though the instrument did appear expensive.

Evelyn's patience wore thin. Her fists clenched as she prepared to teach Natalia a physical lesson about consequences.

"Why so tense, ladies?" A rich baritone voice sliced through the tension.

Natalia whirled around, ready to snap at the interloper, but her angry retort died in her throat.

The man approaching them moved with effortless grace. Towering over both women, his chiseled features belonged on a magazine cover. His tailored suit whispered of wealth and sophistication, yet his demeanor carried a youthful charm.

Natalia's demeanor transformed instantly. Her aggressive stance melted into demure submission, cheeks pinkening. "Forgive the disturbance, sir. I'm simply distraught because she damaged my priceless antique and refuses to compensate me."

"How dreadful," the man murmured with mock concern.

Evelyn watched Dominic Prescott's approach with wary curiosity. She recognized Nathaniel's friend immediately but couldn't fathom why he'd involve himself in this petty dispute.

Dominic turned his full attention to Natalia. "May I examine the damage?"

Fluttering her lashes, Natalia presented the ukulele like a sacred relic. "See these deep scratches, sir? All her doing!" She shot Evelyn a triumphant look, clearly believing this handsome stranger had taken her side.

Dominic tutted sympathetically as he inspected the instrument. "Such a shame for such a fine piece."

Bolstered by his apparent support, Natalia launched into fresh tears. "You must help me, sir! This is a genuine antique, and she refuses to take responsibility!"

The performance was almost impressive in its theatricality. Almost.
###Chapter 100

"Stop crying. Those tears will ruin your perfect makeup."

Dominic Prescott reached into his tailored jacket, producing a silk handkerchief with effortless elegance. His fingers brushed against Natalia Petrova's cheeks with practiced gentleness, dabbing away her tears.

Natalia's pulse raced at the touch of such a refined, aristocratic man. His attention only confirmed what she already believed—she was irresistible.

This must be my knight in shining armor, she thought dreamily.

She leaned subtly into his space, fluttering her lashes. "Thank you. I feel much better now."

Dominic's lips curved. "I'm glad." He pressed the handkerchief into her palm, lingering just a second too long. "That melody from earlier—was that you playing? It was exquisite."

Natalia stiffened. The truth would only give Evelyn Whitmore another moment to steal her spotlight. She bit her lip, feigning regret. "The song you heard... it came from this ukulele. But now it's ruined."

"What a shame." Dominic's gaze darkened as he finally looked at Evelyn. "Why would you break it, little sister?"

Sister? Evelyn's eyebrow shot up. She shot Nathaniel Grayson's friend a withering glare. First Nathaniel with his bizarre behavior, now this guy. No wonder they're friends.

Natalia gasped. "Sister? What do you mean?"

Dominic's smile never wavered. "She's my sworn brother's woman. That makes her family."

"His—what?" Natalia's face twisted in disbelief. She stared between Evelyn and Dominic, betrayal sharp in her chest.

How does that wretched Evelyn keep stealing everything that should be mine?

Dominic turned, addressing the figure leaning against the doorframe. "Quit lurking. Your darling just destroyed this poor girl's instrument."

Evelyn followed his gaze. Nathaniel strode forward, hands tucked casually in his pockets, his expression unreadable.

Her jaw clenched. Great. Just what I needed.

Dominic handed the damaged ukulele to Nathaniel. "See these scratches? Your little troublemaker's handiwork."

Nathaniel inspected it for half a second—then smashed it against the wall.

The sound of splintering wood echoed through the room. The neck dangled uselessly in his grip before he tossed it aside like garbage.

Natalia shrieked. "My ukulele!"

"Compensate her, Lucas," Nathaniel ordered, tone icy.

Lucas Sinclair nodded. "Right away, sir."

Nathaniel ignored the chaos, his focus solely on Evelyn. "Are you done here?"

Evelyn stared at the wreckage, lips parted. "...Yeah. We can go."

His arm slid around her shoulders, steering her toward the exit.

She halted abruptly, twisting back. "Lucas—pay the original price. Not a cent more. He won't reimburse you for overpaying."

Lucas sighed. "Understood, Miss Evelyn."

With that, Evelyn let Nathaniel lead her away, leaving stunned silence in their wake.
###Chapter 101

The man's retreating figure towered over the petite girl trailing behind him. Their height difference created an almost comical contrast.

Natalia crouched on the pavement, tears streaming down her face. Her precious ukulele lay in ruins before her.

She'd hoped her dramatic weeping would summon back the handsome stranger who'd wiped her tears earlier. But no knight in shining armor came to her rescue.

When she finally looked up, all she saw was Dominic's broad back disappearing into the distance.

'Why is he leaving? Doesn't he care about my suffering?'

Scrambling to her feet, Natalia dashed after him. "Sir! Please wait!"

Dominic paused, turning with an amused smirk. "Yes? Can I help you?"

Natalia blinked in confusion. 'His smile looks the same, but his eyes feel so much colder now.'

"Um...I wanted to return your handkerchief." She extended the fabric with trembling fingers, waiting breathlessly for him to ask for her contact details.

"Keep it." Dominic's lips curled in distaste. "Consider it a gift."

Natalia's cheeks flushed pink. Her heart raced wildly.

'He's giving it to me? This is designer silk! What could this mean?'

As romantic scenarios played through her mind, Dominic delivered his crushing verdict. "It's tainted now. I don't want anything touched by a liar's tears."

Natalia froze.

'Liar? Me?' Panic set in as she stammered, "Sir, you've got the wrong idea—"

Dominic cut her off with a chilling smile. "Really? You didn't play that ukulele, yet you took credit. You damaged it yourself to frame someone. And now these crocodile tears? 'Liar' is putting it kindly."

Natalia's mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water. Her fairytale prince had turned into her worst nightmare.

As Dominic walked away, Lucas approached with a businesslike expression. "Miss, we've appraised your instrument. The compensation will be three thousand dollars. Please provide your account details."

Natalia's face twisted in fury. "Three thousand? It's worth fifteen! I won't accept a penny less!"

Lucas remained impassive. "Then we'll need to see the receipt. Otherwise, we'll settle this in court."

The word 'court' made Natalia flinch. A lawsuit was the last thing a fresh graduate needed.

Grudgingly, she rattled off her bank details, seething with resentment. In her mind, Evelyn was to blame for everything.

'This isn't over between us.'

Inside the car, Evelyn focused on her phone, ignoring the tension.

Nathaniel's icy voice cut through the silence. "Quite the musician, Evelyn." The sarcasm dripped from every word.
###Chapter 102

"Leave me alone," Evelyn muttered without looking up.

Nathaniel rested his chin on his hand, studying her profile. "Where did you learn to play like that?"

His question carried genuine curiosity. It defied logic how effortlessly Evelyn had mastered the ukulele. Though their marriage began as a transaction, he'd thoroughly investigated her background afterward.

The Whitmores were decently well-off, but Evelyn was the illegitimate daughter raised in rural poverty by distant relatives. Musical education shouldn't have been accessible to her. Yet her performance earlier required at least eight years of dedicated practice.

The contradictions intrigued him.

Evelyn ignored his probing stare, glaring at her bank balance. The party expenses had drained her account down to forty dollars. All because of the man sitting beside her - who now dared mock her musical skills!

She clenched her teeth. "We're not actually married, Mr. Grayson. My past has nothing to do with you. In three months we'll never see each other again, so stop prying."

Nathaniel's brow furrowed at her sharp tone. "I compensated that girl for her broken ukulele. Is this how you show gratitude?"

'Gratitude? I should tell you to mind your damn business!'

She rolled her eyes. "You're the one who smashed it against the wall. Who else should pay for it?"

For the first time, Nathaniel experienced the sting of true ingratitude.

Evelyn huffed. "And thanks to you, I just spent my entire month's allowance treating fifty classmates!"

Ah. So that was the real issue.

Nathaniel smirked. "I thought you enjoyed socializing. Is money all you care about?"

"Socializing doesn't mean bankrolling everyone! Not all of us can throw cash around like you." She crossed her arms. "Large groups always split checks. You cost me a month's salary!"

This fiery side of Evelyn was new. Since their arrangement began, she'd been carefully diplomatic. Now her pout made her lips resemble a duck's bill.

"I'll reimburse you," he said casually.

"Really?" Her eyes sparkled as she instantly pulled up her payment app, amount already calculated to the cent.

Nathaniel blinked at her shameless efficiency.

Evelyn saw no reason for pretense. She never wanted to spend that money! He'd manipulated the situation, announcing she'd treat everyone. Backing out would've made her look stingy. But these funds were meant for her mother's paintings, not frivolous parties.

With an amused chuckle, Nathaniel scanned her QR code.

The instant transfer visibly lifted Evelyn's mood. Her tense expression softened. "You know my classmates think you're either my sugar daddy or adoptive father now?"

Nathaniel stiffened. "Do I look that old?"

She smirked. "Not exactly. They assume I'm your kept woman since you're too young to be my real father."

His gaze darkened at the implication she'd endured humiliation.
###Chapter 103

"Why would you play the ukulele for them, then?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "You think I wanted to perform for them? Some of the girls accused me of having an affair with the dean. It caused a huge scandal on campus. The only way they'd apologize was if I played, so I had no choice! I respect the dean too much to let his reputation be ruined."

Nathaniel studied her intently before suddenly leaning closer. "Why didn't you just tell them about me?"

Evelyn's breath hitched when his impossibly handsome face invaded her personal space. Every angle of his features was perfection. Her pulse raced as she thought, 'What is he doing?!'

"Ahem! Tell them what exactly?"

Nathaniel's enigmatic eyes seemed to pull her into their depths. He leaned even closer, his voice dropping to a husky whisper. "That I'm not some sugar daddy but your husband."

The word 'husband' spoken so close to her ear made Evelyn's heart stutter.

When she regained her composure, Evelyn rolled her eyes dramatically. "No way! I don't want anyone knowing I got married so young. I still want to have a real wedding someday with someone I actually love!"

Hearing her talk about marrying someone she 'actually loved', Nathaniel's expression remained neutral but a shadow crossed his features. He smirked. "Is that so? I'd like to see who'd be brave enough to marry someone like you."

Evelyn bristled. "What's that supposed to mean? What's wrong with me?"

Nathaniel's gaze turned intense. "You're the kind of woman who grabs random strangers off the street and kisses them. What does that say about you?"

Evelyn huffed. "I told you, that was an accid—"

The car jerked to a sudden stop. The momentum threw them forward—their lips brushing briefly in the chaos.

Nathaniel's pupils dilated as he immediately pulled back. "My apologies." It clearly hadn't been intentional.

Evelyn's cheeks burned. She wanted to yell at him but found she couldn't.

It was doubly awkward because she'd just been insisting their first kiss was accidental. Now this? She couldn't keep claiming accidents without sounding ridiculous.

Defeated, she stayed silent, pushing Nathaniel away. She wiped her mouth roughly with her sleeve before turning to lower the window, letting the evening air cool her flushed face. She stared resolutely at the passing scenery, pretending nothing happened.

Her profile was delicate—thick lashes framing her eyes, cheeks still holding traces of baby fat. The wind played with her hair, but her ears remained stubbornly pink from the incident.

Nathaniel found himself staring longer than intended.

The car stopped completely. The driver returned after checking the situation. "Sir, there's been an accident ahead. We won't be moving anytime soon."

Traffic jams—the bane of every commuter.

Nathaniel was rubbing his temples when the car door opened. Evelyn was already stepping out.

"Where are you going?"

"There's a train station ahead. I'll take the train back." She walked off without waiting for a response.

Being stuck in traffic with Nathaniel was torture she'd rather avoid.

Nathaniel's brow furrowed. After a beat, he exited the car too.

Lucas, his assistant, moved to follow but Nathaniel stopped him with a command. "You're dismissed for the day."

Lucas hesitated but complied. "Yes, sir..."

Watching Nathaniel follow Evelyn, Lucas worried. Nathaniel had never taken public transportation before.

And what exactly were his intentions toward Evelyn?

Near the train station, traffic was even worse.

In a luxury SUV stuck in the gridlock sat Cassandra and her parents, returning home after celebrating her new contract with Holden Group's entertainment division.

Today marked her official signing. Along with a company car, they'd promised her unlimited resources.

Cassandra envisioned her future as an international superstar. Only this traffic jam dampened her mood.

Leaning out the window to check the road, she spotted Evelyn crossing the street with a tall man.

"Mom! Dad! Isn't that Evelyn? Why's she with some man so late at night?"
###Chapter 104

Victoria's sharp gasp made Gregory and Evelyn both turn toward the car window.

Evelyn rolled her eyes dramatically. "Gregory, look! That's Nathaniel! Who's that woman with him? It's the middle of the night, and he's out here alone with some girl? How inappropriate!"

Gregory's face darkened. First, because his daughter Evelyn was out at this hour with a man, and second, because he watched as she disappeared into the train station with him. From this angle, he couldn’t see the man’s face—just his broad shoulders and unremarkable clothes. One word came to mind: broke.

Cassandra sighed, feigning concern. "Dad, why would Evelyn date someone who takes the train? She could do so much better than this. The men Mom introduced her to at least had cars and houses!"

Victoria nodded in agreement, shaking her head. "Let her be. If she likes him, that’s all that matters. He’s tall, maybe even handsome, but if he’s poor? What then? We can’t afford to take in some freeloading son-in-law."

"Looks don’t pay bills!" Gregory snapped, his pride wounded. He’d just come from celebrating Cassandra’s new contract with a major company, clinking glasses with executives. And here was Evelyn, dragging their family name through the mud with some nobody.

Cassandra and Victoria exchanged smug glances. In their eyes, Evelyn deserved nothing more than a man who rode public transportation.

Inside the station, Nathaniel stood behind Evelyn, watching as she tapped at the ticket machine. The moment she finished, she turned and walked away without so much as a glance in his direction.

Nathaniel stepped forward, scanning the unfamiliar interface. He wasn’t clueless—just unfamiliar with the train lines. Which station was she going to?

When he glanced around, Evelyn was already gone.

The woman behind him huffed impatiently. "Are you buying a ticket or not? Some of us have places to be!"

Nathaniel turned, his icy glare silencing her instantly. She quickly scurried to another line.

He pulled out his phone and dialed Lucas. "Which station?"

Lucas hesitated. "Uh… I don’t know. I don’t exactly ride the train, sir."

"Figure it out. Now."

Just then, soft laughter drifted from behind him.

Nathaniel turned to see Evelyn leaning against a pillar, arms crossed, smirking. "First time at a train station, rich boy?"

He didn’t answer.

She grinned and tossed a ticket at him like a playing card. "Since you reimbursed my party bill, consider this my treat."

Nathaniel caught it effortlessly, glancing at the ticket between his fingers. His jaw tightened.

She bought my ticket too?

She was watching me the whole time.

Tch.
###Chapter 105

Nathaniel wasn't angry. A faint smirk played on his lips as he followed Evelyn inside. Moments later, Lucas called back. "Sir, I've located the tickets! You should purchase-"

"Already handled," Nathaniel interrupted before hanging up abruptly.

On the other end, Lucas blinked in confusion, phone still pressed to his ear.

Evelyn walked slowly toward the waiting area, barely suppressing her laughter at Nathaniel's brusque dismissal of his assistant.

The sharp-eyed man caught her amusement instantly. "Something funny?" His voice carried its usual chill.

Evelyn grinned. "Just wondering what would happen if someone like you lost everything. Would you even remember how to function?"

Nathaniel's brow furrowed. "You enjoy mocking me?"

She shrugged shamelessly. "Absolutely! I even snapped a photo of you struggling with the ticket machine. Can't wait to show Margaret when we get back."

A vein pulsed visibly at Nathaniel's temple. "Evelyn!"

She pulled out her phone, flashing the incriminating picture in his face. "Look at this priceless moment! Never thought I'd see the great Nathaniel Grayson so helpless! Priceless!"

Just then, a skateboarder came barreling toward them.

"Watch out!" Before Evelyn could react, strong arms yanked her against a solid chest. The skateboarder wobbled but sped away without apology.

Nathaniel looked down at the suddenly speechless woman in his arms. "Too busy laughing at me to watch where you're going?" His tone dripped with amusement.

Evelyn huffed. Fine, she'd been careless.

"Stop playing with your phone while walking," Nathaniel ordered. "Switch sides."

"Fine." She pocketed her device and obediently moved to his other side. "Thanks for the save. But I'm keeping the photo."

Nathaniel merely snorted, his icy demeanor belied by the warmth in his gaze. A ghost of a smile touched his lips.

The night train was nearly empty. They selected pristine seats, Nathaniel's designer suit and commanding presence drawing every eye in the carriage. Women stole glances; men did double-takes. He sat like royalty, utterly indifferent to the attention.

After several stops, the train grew quieter. Evelyn's dead phone left her stranded in awkward silence. She turned to find Nathaniel studying her intently, his expression unreadable.

The scrutiny made her fidget. "Let's make a deal, mister."

Nathaniel arched one perfect eyebrow. "I'm listening."
###Chapter 106

Evelyn closed her eyes briefly, exhaustion etching stern lines across her usually soft features.

She sighed. "Mister Grayson, I wish we could trust each other more. You don’t need to be so guarded, as if I’d betray you the moment you look away. Just give me some breathing room! I already promised I wouldn’t break our agreement before the three months are up. Can’t you take my word for it?"

Nathaniel stared at her, unblinking. "You think I’m worried about you?"

Evelyn lifted her chin, tilting her head as her wide eyes met his. "Then what else? You wouldn’t have shown up at a party you clearly despised, barged into my room, and humiliated my classmate if you weren’t keeping tabs on me!"

His voice was cool. "Miss Whitmore, remember our arrangement. For these three months, your safety is partially my responsibility. It’s not you I distrust—it’s the men around you. Can’t you see they have ulterior motives?"

She scoffed. "I’m not an idiot. Of course I see it. But I can handle myself. They won’t get anywhere with me."

Nathaniel arched a brow. "Oh? Then why were you raising that glass, ready to drink when they cheered?"

"It was just a cocktail!" Evelyn frowned, annoyed he was making such a big deal out of it.

She knew her limits. One sip wouldn’t hurt.

"Just a cocktail?" His tone sharpened. "How do you know they didn’t slip something in it? At parties like that, you never accept drinks from strangers. Appearances deceive. Do I really need to explain this to you?"

Evelyn blinked, momentarily speechless. Since when did Mister Grayson take his guardian role this seriously?

She’d only ever heard lectures like this in cheesy dramas. After her mother died, no one had cared enough to scold her. Her father barely acknowledged her existence unless she embarrassed the family.

This was… strange.

Regaining her composure, she smirked. "What about the drinks you give me? Should I refuse those too?"

Nathaniel went still for a beat before narrowing his eyes. "Am I the same as them?"

Her smirk turned mocking. "Oh, you’re very different. You don’t look like the type to chase after women—let alone someone like me. So, no, you wouldn’t bother drugging me. Right?"

A slow, humorless smile curved his lips. "You’re sharper than I thought, Miss Whitmore."

"You’re ridiculous." She rolled her eyes. "First, you tease me about no one ever marrying me. Now, you’re paranoid someone will spike my drink."

He leaned back, watching her with sardonic amusement. "The world’s full of surprises. Some people have… unconventional tastes."

Evelyn’s lips twitched. "Well, thanks for your concern, Mister Grayson. I’ll be sure to thank your ancestors too."

Her voice trailed off as drowsiness overtook her. Moments later, her head dropped onto his shoulder, her breathing steady.

Nathaniel glanced down at the woman who’d just claimed his shoulder as her pillow.

No one had ever dared.

His expression darkened, but he didn’t push her away.

When Evelyn woke, she was in her bed at the Grayson estate, the sky still dark outside.

How had she gotten home?

She rubbed her temples, but the memory of leaving the train station was a blur.
###Chapter 107

The memory gap didn't trouble Evelyn much. What truly bothered her was the lingering grime from her outdoor excursion still clinging to her skin. The discomfort twisted her stomach.

She dragged herself from the bed, grabbing fresh clothes from the wardrobe. Pushing the bathroom door open, she stepped inside-

Steam enveloped the space. Running water echoed against marble tiles. The warmth hit her like a wall.

'Did I leave the tap running earlier?' she wondered.

Curiosity propelled her forward until a shocking sight froze her in place - a naked man with sculpted shoulders and a tapered waist stood under the shower spray.

The bather turned at the sound of intrusion. Their gazes collided.

His eyes burned with predatory intensity. Hers widened in mortified shock.

Reality slammed into her. She gasped, spinning away. "Nathaniel! Why didn't you lock the damn door?"

His voice dripped sarcasm. "Miss Whitmore. This happens to be my private bathroom. Shouldn't you be knocking before invading my space?"

Heat flooded her cheeks. "You never use this suite! How was I supposed to know you'd suddenly decide to shower here?"

"Interesting logic." Water droplets glistened on his torso as he stepped closer. "You break into my bathroom, yet I'm the one being interrogated?"

Evelyn's mouth opened, then closed. The bastard had a point.

"Planning to leave? Or shall I expect company?" Nathaniel's smirk made her blood boil.

"Ugh!" She slammed the door hard enough to rattle the frame.

The lingering scent of sandalwood soap clung to her senses, conjuring unwanted images of toned muscle and dripping water. She shook her head violently to dispel the vision.

Then another memory surfaced.

She'd fallen asleep on the train. Nathaniel hadn't woken her at the station. Instead, he'd carried her home like some damsel.

Her cheeks burned hotter.

"Damn him!"

Exhaustion had claimed her after graduation chaos - Abigail's scheming, police station visits, that forced ukulele performance at the class party. Still, Nathaniel's unexpected kindness unsettled her. The man who ignored everyone had actually bothered with her.

The bathroom door creaked open. Nathaniel emerged in a robe, his damp hair sending droplets down his neck.

Evelyn held her breath and slipped past him without meeting his eyes.

When she finished showering, Nathaniel lay asleep on the couch. With Margaret in residence, separate bedrooms weren't an option. At least the arrogant bastard was unconscious.

Morning light revealed an empty suite. Evelyn exhaled in relief.

Outside her door, a maid descended the stairs with a suitcase.

"Whose luggage is that?" Evelyn called after her.
###Chapter 108

The maid paused and replied, "Madam Margaret is departing, ma'am."

'Grandma is leaving?' Evelyn thought.

A wave of dread washed over her. She feared Abigail's actions yesterday had deeply hurt Margaret. Just then, she heard her name being called softly.

"Evelyn."

She glanced up to see Margaret approaching her with slow, deliberate steps.

"Grandma, I heard you're leaving," Evelyn said.

Margaret offered a gentle smile and sighed. "Yes, I must return to your grandfather. That stubborn old man refuses to listen, even after his surgery. He ignores the doctor's orders when I'm not there, so I need to keep an eye on him."

"I understand." Evelyn didn't press her to stay once she knew the reason. "Take care of yourself, Grandma. Have a safe trip."

Margaret nodded and took Evelyn's hand. "Evelyn, I know you've endured a lot since marrying Nathaniel. Abigail went too far. Don't worry—once she's released, I'll have someone escort her to her grandfather. He'll discipline her properly. I won't let her stay here and cause more trouble for you two."

It was rare for a grandmother who adored her granddaughter to acknowledge her cruelty.

Evelyn was moved by Margaret's fairness. "Thank you for understanding."

"Oh, and Evelyn?" Margaret added with a knowing smile. "After I leave, you and Nathaniel must keep working hard, too!"

'Working hard?' Evelyn blinked in confusion.

Then, catching the mischievous glint in Margaret's eyes, she realized what she meant. Her cheeks flushed instantly.

Still, she forced a laugh. "Oh—aha—don't worry, we will!"

Margaret beamed. "Wonderful! I'll be waiting for good news!"

Evelyn murmured, "Okay..."

She knew Margaret would be disappointed. There would be no good news between her and Nathaniel. By the time Margaret returned, their contract would likely be ending, and she'd have to leave.

Nathaniel had instructed Lucas to take Margaret to the airport.

Since Margaret had been nothing but kind to her, Evelyn decided to accompany them to see her off.

After bidding Margaret farewell at the airport, Lucas handed her a job application form in the car.

"Miss Whitmore," he said, "Sir arranged this for you. He knows you'll need work after graduating."

Evelyn arched a brow, eyeing the form. "What kind of job is this?"

Lucas started the engine. "Fill this out first. HR will assign a suitable position based on your preferences."

Working at Grayson Group was a golden opportunity—but Evelyn wasn't interested.

Then it struck her. For the next three months, she'd be free from Nathaniel's control.

'Why not take advantage of this?' she thought.

She tossed the form aside. "I won't fill it out. Just give me whatever pays the most."

Lucas couldn't help but admire her bluntness. He chuckled. "Alright. I'll arrange everything and take you to get started."

"No," Evelyn insisted. "Let's go now. I have nothing better to do anyway."

"...Alright."

With that, Lucas drove toward one of Grayson Group's subsidiaries.
###Chapter 109

Lucas pulled the car to a stop when his phone rang. His expression darkened instantly.

"I'll be there immediately!"

Ending the call, he turned to Evelyn with an apologetic frown. "Miss Whitmore, something urgent has come up. I won't be able to accompany you inside. Head straight to Mr. Kingsley's office—mention my name, and he'll handle your onboarding."

Evelyn gave a quick nod and flashed an 'okay' sign before stepping out of the car.

The tires screeched as Lucas sped away.

She watched the car vanish around the corner, a thoughtful crease forming between her brows. What kind of emergency could that be? Did something happen to Nathaniel?

The Holden Group subsidiary was a thriving entertainment agency. Evelyn strode into the sleek lobby and approached the reception desk.

The receptionist eyed her briefly before calling Mr. Kingsley to confirm.

"Miss Whitmore, right this way." She gestured for Evelyn to follow.

"Mr. Kingsley is currently in a meeting with one of our talents. You'll need to wait outside until they're finished," the receptionist explained before retreating.

Evelyn leaned against the wall, arms crossed.

Nearby, two employees chatted loudly in the pantry while waiting for their coffees.

"Did you hear? The agency just signed Cassandra Whitmore."

"Obviously! She's everywhere right now."

"All because of that scandal, though. After all those PR spins, she's somehow more famous than ever. I don’t get why management would take her on when her reputation’s in the gutter."

"Reputation doesn’t matter if she’s profitable. Controversy sells. These days, any celebrity who brings in cash is worth their weight in gold."

"Speaking of, she’s in with Mr. Kingsley right now. Wonder what they’re discussing."

"Who knows?"

The two grabbed their drinks and left.

Evelyn’s lips pressed into a thin line. So, Cassandra’s in there.

Just yesterday, Victoria and Cassandra had been gloating on social media about Cassandra’s new contract with Holden’s entertainment division. Their excitement had been nauseating.

But something didn’t add up.

The scandal video had clearly shown Cassandra with a wealthy older man—undeniable proof. Yet, miraculously, the narrative had flipped. The woman was suddenly some look-alike influencer who’d undergone surgery to mimic Cassandra.

The sheer scale of the PR campaign to bury the truth was staggering. There was no way Victoria and Cassandra could’ve pulled it off alone.

Victoria must have pulled some strings.

The office door swung open.

Cassandra emerged, perfectly coiffed and beaming—until her eyes landed on Evelyn. Her smile shattered.

"Evelyn Whitmore?" Her voice sharpened. "What the hell are you doing here?"
###Chapter 110

Evelyn Whitmore offered a faint smile. "I'm here to work."

Cassandra Blackwood raised an eyebrow. "Work here? I thought you were a nanny for some wealthy employer."

"My employer is rarely home, and there's not much to do there," Evelyn explained smoothly. "I figured I'd take on a part-time job to earn extra money."

Cassandra's gaze swept over Evelyn's deliberately plain appearance, her lips curling in disdain. "Pathetic. You actually need a side job? Guess your rich boss isn't paying you enough."

Evelyn nodded without hesitation. "Not nearly enough."

"Cassandra, what's the hold-up? Aren't you here to pick up your magazine proofs?" A warm, middle-aged voice called from inside the office.

Cassandra turned, instantly softening her expression. "Mister Kingsley, I was just leaving, but someone's blocking the way."

"Blocking the way?" Mister Kingsley stepped out, ready to reprimand whoever dared inconvenience his star model.

Then he saw Evelyn.

His sharp words died in his throat.

Decades in the entertainment industry had exposed him to countless beauties, but this woman—bare-faced, effortlessly striking—was something else entirely.

He cleared his throat. "And you are...?"

Evelyn met his gaze evenly. "Evelyn Whitmore. I was told to see you about a job."

Mister Kingsley's eyes widened in recognition. "Ah! Evelyn Whitmore—of course! Come in, come in!"

Lucas Sinclair had called him minutes ago, requesting a respectable position for a woman by that name. Though Lucas hadn't elaborated, Mister Kingsley wasn't stupid. If the CEO's right-hand man was personally involved, this girl mattered.

Evelyn followed him inside.

Cassandra stood frozen outside the door, nails digging into her palms. What the hell just happened?

Mister Kingsley should've scolded that nobody and sent her packing. Instead, he'd looked at Evelyn like she was some rare gem and practically ushered her in with red-carpet treatment.

Fury burned in Cassandra's chest. She wasn't about to leave. Stomping back inside, she planted herself near the desk, determined to witness whatever farce was about to unfold.

"Miss Whitmore," Mister Kingsley began, settling behind his desk, "what kind of work are you interested in?"

Evelyn didn't hesitate. "Anything. As long as it pays well."

Mister Kingsley studied her, tapping his chin. "Have you ever considered modeling? With your looks, you could—"

"No," Evelyn cut in. "Not interested. Got anything else?"

This was just a temporary gig—three months, then she'd vanish from Nathaniel Grayson's life for good.

Cassandra's grip tightened on her purse. Modeling? The suggestion alone was a threat.

She refused to admit Evelyn was beautiful, but she wasn't blind. If this nobody signed with the agency, she'd steal contracts, attention—everything Cassandra had worked for.

Over my dead body.
###Chapter 111

The thought barely formed in Cassandra's mind before she barged in, cutting their conversation short.

"Mister Kingsley, is she applying for a job? Let her work with me. My assistant position is open."

Mister Kingsley hesitated, rubbing his temple. "Well, uhh..."

Considering Lucas was the one who sent Evelyn to him, he doubted it was appropriate to have her serve as a celebrity's assistant—a job that required catering to someone else's needs.

"Cassandra, I appreciate the offer, but I don't think that's suitable. Miss Whitmore here is—"

"How much does an assistant make?" Evelyn interrupted.

Mister Kingsley blinked, taken aback. Why would someone with her potential settle for being an assistant?

Cassandra smirked, lifting her chin. "Around four-fifty to six hundred a month. Don't worry, I won't make your life miserable."

Evelyn leaned back in her chair, unimpressed. "Pass. That's pocket change."

She saw right through Cassandra's game.

Cassandra's brows furrowed. "Too little? What's your price then?"

Evelyn stretched lazily. "Fifteen hundred."

Cassandra scoffed, rolling her eyes. "Fifteen hundred? For fetching coffee and running errands? You're delusional."

Ignoring her, Evelyn turned to Mister Kingsley. "You wanted to sign me as a celebrity, right? The pay must be decent?"

Mister Kingsley perked up, hopeful. "Absolutely! Base salary plus commissions. The sky's the limit!"

Evelyn tapped her chin, feigning interest. "Hmm, sounds tempting. Maybe I should—"

"Fine! Fifteen hundred it is!" Cassandra snapped, panic flashing in her eyes. "You can start as my assistant!"

Evelyn arched a brow. "Great. Wire me a month's advance now."

Cassandra's face darkened. "Evelyn Whitmore, don't push it."

Evelyn turned back to Mister Kingsley. "Actually, I think being a celebrity sounds—"

"Done! You'll get your damn advance!" Cassandra hissed through gritted teeth.

Evelyn grinned. "Perfect. Transfer it now."

Fuming, Cassandra forced a smile and keyed in the payment, already plotting how to make Evelyn regret this.

Mister Kingsley watched, baffled. Miss Whitmore, are you sure? Being an assistant is grueling. Wouldn’t you rather be in front of the camera?

Evelyn checked her account, satisfied. "Thanks for the offer, but I’d rather not embarrass myself on screen. Assistant work suits me just fine."

Mister Kingsley sighed. What a waste. She could’ve been a star.

Cassandra yanked Evelyn out before she could reconsider.

In the car—

Evelyn, now officially on the clock, handed Cassandra a soda. "Why so tense? Drink up."

Cassandra glared. "I’m not tense! Don’t act like you know me!"

Evelyn smirked. "Then why drag me out so fast? Afraid Mister Kingsley would sign me instead?"

Cassandra’s nails dug into her seat. "You think you’re special just because he wanted you? With that backwater charm, you’d flop in a week!"

Evelyn tilted her head. "Really? We’ll see."
###Chapter 112

Cassandra shot Evelyn a glare. Just as she was about to launch into another tirade, her phone's ringtone cut through the tension.

It was a video call from their father, Gregory.

Cassandra rolled her eyes dramatically and waved the phone in Evelyn's face. "Look who's calling me! Bet you never get calls from Daddy. Proves how little he cares about you."

Evelyn smirked. "If you don't answer soon, your precious daddy might hang up."

With a huff, Cassandra answered and deliberately put it on speaker. She wanted Evelyn to hear every word.

Gregory and Victoria appeared on screen, their faces lighting up at the sight of their celebrity daughter. "Cassandra, how was work today?" Gregory asked with concern. "Have you eaten?"

Cassandra pouted dramatically. "No, Daddy. Too busy working to eat."

Gregory frowned. "That's unacceptable! You must take care of yourself!"

Victoria nodded vigorously. "Listen to your father. At least drink some milk! We can't bear seeing you sick from hunger!"

Cassandra sighed theatrically. "I'm not hungry... except maybe for your famous meatballs, Daddy."

Gregory beamed. "That's easily arranged! I'll make them when you get home."

"But I'll be back so late... You'll be asleep," Cassandra whined.

"I'll wake up no matter how late it is!" Gregory promised.

"Thanks, Daddy! I knew you loved me most!" Cassandra cooed.

"Alright, we won't keep you. Come home early! I'll have those meatballs ready!" Gregory said.

Just as he was about to hang up, Cassandra stopped him. "Wait! Look who's here!"

She abruptly turned the camera toward Evelyn.

Gregory's expression darkened when he saw his disappointing younger daughter. "Evelyn? Why are you in Cassandra's car?"

Evelyn opened her mouth to respond, but Cassandra quickly turned the camera back. "Daddy, Evelyn came to interview at my company today. I hired her as my assistant. Keeping talent in the family, right?"

Gregory nodded. "Turn the camera back to your sister. I need to speak with her."

Cassandra complied reluctantly.

Gregory fixed Evelyn with a stern look. "You should be grateful Cassandra gave you this opportunity. Better than being some stranger's nanny. At least this way your stepmother and I won't worry."

Evelyn's polite smile twisted into something sharper. "Oh, I'm absolutely grateful."

After the call ended, Cassandra preened. "See that? I'll always be Daddy's favorite. No matter what I do, he'll forgive me. You? Nothing you do will ever matter."

Evelyn closed her eyes, feigning indifference.

Cassandra wasn't satisfied. "Evelyn Whitmore! No one in this world loves you!"

Evelyn's grip tightened on her water bottle. "Should I die then, just because no one loves me?"

Cassandra sneered. "No one would care if you did! Ivy League degree and what? Still ending up as my assistant. Better behave, or I'll have Daddy throw you out!"

Evelyn didn't even open her eyes. "Do your worst. I'll be waiting."

Cassandra seethed at her sister's indifference.

'Plenty of time to break her,' she thought darkly.
###Chapter 113

The afternoon photoshoot for the magazine cover was when Cassandra began her little game.

She bombarded Evelyn with endless demands. Fetch this, buy that—over and over, just to make her life miserable.

But Evelyn had seen it coming. She wasn’t fazed. Instead, she moved swiftly, treating Cassandra’s petty torment like a workout.

The paycheck wasn’t why she’d agreed to be Cassandra’s assistant. She wanted to uncover how Cassandra and Victoria had twisted the truth.

From what she’d pieced together, their methods were dirty. Staying close to Cassandra would make digging easier.

By the time the shoot wrapped up, the sky had darkened. Evelyn had no intention of riding back with Cassandra—she planned to hail a cab to the Grayson estate.

But—

“Evelyn Whitmore, where do you think you’re going?” Cassandra’s mocking voice cut through the air. “Did I say you could leave?”

Clearly, she wasn’t done making Evelyn’s day hell.

Evelyn turned, unimpressed. “It’s past working hours.”

Cassandra smirked. “Who said assistants get fixed hours? You’re off when I say you’re off.”

Evelyn arched a brow. “So, you have more work?”

Cassandra flipped her hair. “No, but I’m attending an elite party tonight. Consider yourself lucky—I’m letting you tag along.”

An elite party? Hard pass.

Still, it was odd. Cassandra, a minor celebrity with a recent scandal, shouldn’t have been invited.

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. “Fine. Let’s go.”

Cassandra’s smile widened—like everything was going according to plan. “Get in the car. I picked out your outfit. Change now.”

Evelyn nodded and stepped inside.

Cassandra watched her, a sly grin curling her lips.

Tonight’s party was the event of the season. Rumor had it, the city’s elite would all be there.
###Chapter 114

Cassandra nearly choked on her laughter when Evelyn emerged in the outfit she'd picked out.

The hideous floral dress looked like it had been salvaged from a rural thrift store.

Cassandra seethed with jealousy at Evelyn's natural beauty—her flawless skin, those striking features, all untouched by makeup. If she didn't sabotage Evelyn's appearance, that wretched face would steal the spotlight—and worse, catch the eye of some wealthy elite.

Just like Nathaniel Grayson had in his office. His gaze had lingered on Evelyn far too long.

Cassandra had despised that face since childhood. Seeing Evelyn dressed like a peasant soothed her bitterness.

"Not bad, right?" she drawled, smirking. "I picked it just for you. You're wearing this to the party."

Evelyn studied her reflection. "Thanks. It's charming."

The makeup artist stifled a snicker, whispering to Cassandra, "She actually thinks it looks good!"

Cassandra's lips curled. "Country upbringing equals country taste. Jessy, do her makeup—something subtle but not too flattering. I can't be seen with an embarrassment."

"Leave it to me."

Jessy smirked, dabbing excessive blush across Evelyn's cheeks, dotting fake freckles, and twisting her hair into childish braids. The result was absurd—a caricature of rural simplicity.

Cassandra approved.

Now, no man would spare Evelyn a second glance.

The Silver Moon Estate was New Capital's most exclusive venue, reserved for society's elite. Money couldn't buy an invitation—only status could.

Uniformed attendants greeted guests at the entrance with polished smiles.

Cassandra strode forward in her designer gown, heels clicking, and presented her invitation.

"Welcome, Miss Whitmore. Enjoy your evening." The attendant gestured inside.

Then she blocked Evelyn. "I'm sorry, ma'am. No entry."

Evelyn blinked. "I'm with her."

The attendant eyed Evelyn's frumpy attire skeptically. "This isn't the kind of event where gatecrashers blend in. Leave, or I'll call security."

Cassandra savored the moment before sighing dramatically. "Oh, let her pass. She's my assistant."

The attendant hesitated, glancing between the elegant socialite and the dowdy girl.

Why would someone like Miss Whitmore employ such a disaster?

"Very well," the attendant relented, though her disdain for Evelyn remained.

Evelyn followed Cassandra inside, unbothered.

The ballroom was a vision of opulence—crystal chandeliers, gilded arches, a live pianist weaving melodies through the air. Luxury dripped from every corner.

Cassandra's breath caught. She'd only ever seen places like this in films, and even those sets paled in comparison.

Then she noticed Evelyn staring, too.

Pathetic.

She sneered. "Overwhelmed? Of course you are. Without me, you'd never step foot in a place like this."

Evelyn smiled faintly, lost in memory.

Nathaniel had dragged her here once before—for a wedding she hadn't wanted.

Three months of freedom, gone in an instant.
###Chapter 115

Evelyn's breath caught when she spotted a familiar face in the crowd. Her fingers tightened around her juice glass as Cassandra whispered sharply, "Stay put and don't move. I've got business to attend to. And for heaven's sake, don't break anything - you couldn't possibly afford the damages."

"Understood," Evelyn murmured, her gaze already tracking Cassandra's movements.

With practiced grace, Cassandra selected a crystal flute of champagne and glided toward a distinguished silver-haired gentleman. Their easy familiarity sent warning bells ringing in Evelyn's mind.

'Since when does Cassandra rub elbows with high society?' Evelyn sipped her drink thoughtfully. 'That man must be her ticket into this world. The sudden wealth, the social climbing - it all adds up. But how did she get connected to someone like him?'

Her analysis was interrupted by shrill laughter.

"Would you look at that fashion disaster!"
"Did someone let their maid crash the party?"
"Those braids belong in a preschool classroom!"

A gaggle of glittering socialites descended upon Evelyn like vultures spotting fresh prey.

"Darling, who exactly are you here with?"
"We're regulars at Silver Moon events, but you're certainly not."

Evelyn barely glanced up before turning away. The dismissal stung.

"How rude!" The ringleader grabbed Evelyn's arm. "We asked you a question."

Evelyn's voice remained ice-calm. "Did you?"

"Do you even have an invitation?"

"No."

Gasping dramatically, the girls exchanged looks. "She admitted it!"

"Then how did you get in?" one demanded.

"Through the front door," Evelyn deadpanned, helping herself to a petit four.

"Clearly just here for the free food," someone sneered.

"Security! We have an intruder!"

As the commotion grew, a rich baritone cut through the noise. "Ladies, what seems to be the problem?"

The crowd parted to reveal Nathaniel Grayson, his piercing gaze locking onto Evelyn with unsettling intensity.
###Chapter 116

The sudden voice made the socialites whirl around, their smug expressions instantly deflating.

"Oh, it's Benjamin!"

"Benjamin Rivers! You're here!"

"Hello, Mr. Rivers!"

Evelyn turned her head too.

The man they were fawning over was Benjamin Rivers - the same man who'd accompanied Abigail to the art gallery that day. Dressed in an immaculate white tuxedo, his aristocratic features and lean frame made him look every inch the young nobleman.

He strode forward with a disapproving frown. "What's with all this racket? You're making a scene."

One of the girls stepped forward, pointing at Evelyn. "Benjamin, we weren't trying to cause trouble. This... person snuck in wearing that hideous outfit just to freeload. We were simply asking her to leave."

"Exactly! The Silver Moon Estate is an exclusive venue. We can't have just anyone wandering in and lowering the tone."

"Benjamin, you should call security to remove her!"

Benjamin tilted his chin up, giving them a withering look. "Since when do you get to decide who belongs here based on their clothes? People can wear whatever they damn well please. Mind your own business."

The girls gaped at him. They'd expected praise for upholding the estate's standards, not this scolding.

"But she definitely crashed the party!"

"She didn't even have an invitation!"

Benjamin rolled his eyes. "If she got past security, she has every right to be here. Do you think the Rivers employ incompetent guards who'd let just anyone waltz in?"

"I... We didn't think of it that way."

"Right. It's not our place to question the estate's security..."

"Sorry, Benjamin. Please forgive us."

With that, the chastened socialites scattered.

Benjamin snorted before turning to the woman they'd been harassing. "There. You're fine now. Don't mind those shallow social climbers."

Evelyn nodded. "Thanks."

"Whatever." He started to walk away dismissively.

Then he froze.

That voice... why did it sound so familiar?

He spun back around - and finally recognized her. "Evelyn? Is that you?"

Evelyn grinned. "Hi there."

Benjamin's face immediately twisted in disgust. "What the hell are you wearing?"

"Whatever I want," she shot back. "Isn't that what you just said?"

He scowled. "If I'd known it was you, I'd have let them throw you out myself!"

Evelyn couldn't help but laugh at his abrupt about-face. The man was fascinating - he'd defended a stranger purely on principle, without any ulterior motives. Only to turn hostile the moment he realized who she was.

His dislike stemmed from Nathaniel's past relationship with his sister Amelia. In Benjamin's eyes, Evelyn was the woman who'd stolen his sister's happiness.

Still, beneath the bluster, he wasn't a bad person.

"Did you come here with Nathaniel?" Benjamin demanded suddenly.

Evelyn's smile vanished at the name. "Is he here too?"

Benjamin looked baffled. "If you didn't come with Nathaniel, how the hell did you get in?"
###Chapter 117

Evelyn responded to Benjamin with forced pride. "That's none of your business."

Benjamin glared at her angrily. "Whatever! I don't have time for this anyway. Just wait—I'll make you pay for this!"

He stormed off as if late for something urgent.

Evelyn scanned the room for Cassandra but couldn't spot her. Cassandra and that middle-aged man had vanished from view. Her search proved futile.

Instead, she noticed several boys around Benjamin's age chasing after him.

"There he is! Heading toward the east wing!"

"Get him!"

"Stop running like a coward, Benjamin Rivers! Face us like a man!"

Benjamin bolted outside but got cornered in the hallway by his pursuers.

"What's wrong, Rivers? Too scared to admit you lost?"

Trapped, Benjamin squared his shoulders defiantly. "I didn't lose!"

"Then honor our bet!" The ringleader smirked, waving a signed document. "Black and white right here. You promised to transfer Silver Moon Estate to my family if you lost the game!"

Benjamin paled. "That's my family's property! I can't just—"

Zachary Montgomery of the Hoyts sneered. "Then why gamble with it? Thought you controlled everything in your family? Pathetic liar."

Benjamin's face flushed crimson. "You cheated! I never would've—"

"Excuses won't cut it." Zachary's smile turned cruel. "Since you're clearly powerless, I'll be generous. Kneel and bark like a dog. Do that, and I'll tear up this contract."

Benjamin's fists clenched. "You—"

"Choose. Either that, or I take this to your father. Let's see if the Rivers men keep their word."

"No!" Panic flashed across Benjamin's face. He couldn't let his family suffer for his mistake. "Fine! I'll—"

He inhaled sharply, shoulders slumping—then suddenly bristled like a cornered animal.

"In your dreams!"

His fist connected with Zachary's jaw. The taller boy slammed him against the wall. "You little—! Get him!"

A brutal punch to Benjamin's stomach sent him crumpling to the floor, clutching his abdomen in agony.

Zachary loomed over him, laughing. "Beg, and maybe I'll stop."

Gritting his teeth, Benjamin glared up through the pain. "Never!"

"Have it your way." Zachary nodded to his friends. "Again."

Benjamin's scream echoed down the hall.

Then—

"Enough." A calm female voice cut through the chaos.

The boys froze, turning toward the speaker.

A plainly dressed woman stood watching them.
###Chapter 118

"Where did this freak come from? Jesus Christ! She's so hideous it's giving me a migraine!"

"Get lost, you disgusting creature! Mind your own business!"

"Beat it before we make you!"

Evelyn Whitmore kept recording with her phone as she approached the group. "I've got everything on video. You've all committed assault. When I hand this to the police and press charges, even as minors, you'll get a record."

"You're all from wealthy families. Need I explain how a criminal record will ruin your college applications, job prospects, and entire futures?"

Zachary Montgomery and his gang exchanged nervous glances. Evelyn had struck a nerve. They hesitated, shifting uncomfortably.

"You stupid bitch! This isn't your fight!" Zachary snarled. "Get that phone!"

He refused to be intimidated by some random woman, especially one who looked so fragile. His friends released Benjamin Rivers and lunged for Evelyn.

Evelyn didn't flinch. Still recording, she dodged their clumsy attempts with surprising agility. She ducked under arms, sidestepped tackles, and even dropped into a squat to avoid being grabbed from behind.

Minutes passed. The boys panted, exhausted, while Evelyn remained untouched, not a single hair out of place.

Benjamin, now sitting up, stared in disbelief. 'Where did she learn to move like that?'

Satisfied with her footage, Evelyn pocketed her phone. Then she smiled—a chilling expression—before launching into a spinning kick that sent all three boys crashing to the pavement.

Benjamin's jaw dropped. That petite frame packed unbelievable power.

"Done!" Evelyn dusted her hands and offered Benjamin help up. "Need an ambulance?"

Face burning, Benjamin looked away. "N-no. I'm fine."

Zachary clutched his stomach as he stood. "What kind of man are you, Benjamin Rivers? Hiding behind some girl?"

Benjamin moved to respond, but Evelyn cut in. "He didn't ask for help. I just couldn't stand watching you cowards gang up on one person."

Zachary's face twisted with humiliation. They couldn't even lay a finger on her. Defeated, he turned back to Benjamin.

"Listen up, Rivers. I'm done playing games. Either hand over Silver Moon Estate like you promised, or I'm taking this to your father and brother!"

Benjamin massaged his temples. "I—"

Evelyn tilted her head. "What was the bet?"

"They cheated at Valor's Edge!" Benjamin spat. "I should've won fair and square!"

Evelyn's eyes gleamed. She faced Zachary. "How about a rematch? If you win, he honors the original bet. If you lose, the debt's erased."
###Chapter 119

Zachary straightened his tie with a scoff. "As if! We won fair and square. Why should we play again? I've got better things to do."

Evelyn remained unfazed. With deliberate calmness, she pulled out her phone and tapped the screen. The video from moments ago began playing - clear footage of Zachary's group ganging up on Benjamin.

"Either agree to a rematch, or this goes straight to the police." Her voice carried quiet steel. "Let's see if your parents would rather have Silver Moon Estate... or keep their precious sons' records clean."

Zachary's jaw clenched. "You—"

He had no choice. Their first attempt had been humiliating enough - they couldn't even touch her. "Fine! One more game! Not that it'll change anything!"

Evelyn nodded. "Since there's no gaming setup here, we'll use mobiles. How about 'Guardian of the King'?"

A smirk spread across Zachary's face at her choice. "Deal. But I'm raising the stakes."

"Go on."

"If you win, I'll hand over the contract for you to destroy. But if we win?" His eyes gleamed. "You delete that video immediately, transfer Silver Moon Estate's deed to me, and Benjamin here does a live stream... barking like a dog."

"Done." Evelyn agreed without hesitation.

Benjamin's head snapped toward her. "Evelyn! Who said you could decide for me? Haven't I been humiliated enough?"

She gave him a withering look. "Couldn't possibly get worse than this."

His face burned crimson. "Silver Moon Estate is my family's legacy," he hissed. "We don't just give it away!"

"Then maybe don't gamble with it," she shot back.

Benjamin's mouth opened and closed like a fish. He was starting to wonder whose side Evelyn was really on.

With terms set, they returned to the banquet hall, finding a secluded corner with plush couches. Zachary had his full team of five. Evelyn and Benjamin would be paired with random players - likely amateurs.

Benjamin leaned close, panic creeping into his whisper. "How good are you at this game? What's your rank?"

"Not great," Evelyn admitted casually. "Beginner level."

His face drained of color. "Then why the hell did you challenge them? Are you trying to ruin me completely?"

She shrugged. "Relax. We might get paired with pros."

Benjamin nearly choked. The odds of that were worse than winning the lottery. While confident in his own skills, carrying a newbie like Evelyn? Impossible. And if their random teammates were noobs too?

His stomach churned at the thought. Not only would he lose the estate permanently, but he'd have to publicly humiliate himself. What would his father say? His brother?

'Damn it, Evelyn! What kind of suicidal plan is this?' he screamed internally.
###Chapter 120

Zachary Montgomery lounged on the sofa with his crew, smug confidence radiating from their relaxed postures. His lips curled into a mocking smirk as he took in Benjamin Rivers' sour expression.

"Benjamin Rivers," Zachary drawled, "I was going to be merciful and let you walk away if you'd just bark like a dog. But you chose this path. Now you'll lose Silver Moon Estate to me - and still end up barking on live stream. Remember, this was your choice!"

Though uncertainty gnawed at him, Benjamin clenched his jaw. "The game hasn't even started yet. Don't count your chickens before they hatch."

Zachary snorted. "Save your tears for when you're howling to the camera."

"Enough talk!" Benjamin snapped. "Let's play."

Phones appeared as the game launched. Zachary's five-man squad formed instantly while Evelyn Whitmore and Benjamin waited for matchmaking.

Three usernames popped up on their team: William Kingsley, Lily Fontaine, and Oliver Quinn.

The match began.

Benjamin's palms were slick with sweat, his initial pessimism weighing heavy. Then he saw their teammates' levels. His eyes nearly bulged from their sockets. These weren't just good players - they were elite.

"Holy shit!" he whispered to Evelyn. "We got matched with max-level players! Just stay back and don't screw this up for us."

Evelyn didn't respond. Her character moved with purpose, charging straight into enemy territory.

"Damn it, Evelyn! Fall back!" Benjamin shouted, scrambling to cover her advance.

Then the system announcements began flashing:

[First blood!]

[Double kill!]

[Triple kill!]

[Quadra kill!]

[Penta kill!]

Benjamin's mouth fell open. Evelyn's level-one character had just wiped out the entire enemy team in the opening minutes.

"That's... not a beginner," he muttered, reassessing the quiet woman beside him.

Zachary's team's initial arrogance evaporated as they struggled to mount any defense. Their panic was palpable, their movements growing increasingly desperate.

When the victory screen appeared, Zachary hurled his phone against the wall.

Benjamin practically vibrated with triumph. He extended his hand, grinning. "Pay up, Montgomery."
###Chapter 121

"You got lucky, Benjamin!" Zachary stood up, yanking the betting contract from his pocket. He crushed it violently between his palms before hurling the crumpled paper at him.

Benjamin caught the projectile, smoothed it out to verify its contents, then shredded it without hesitation.

"You would've lost even without cheating. Why can't you just admit defeat? Want a rematch? If you lose this time, you'll call me 'papa'! Got the guts for that?"

"I don't have time for your childish games!" Zachary's face darkened as he turned away, signaling his entourage to follow in humiliated retreat.

For the first time in weeks, Benjamin stood tall.

Meanwhile, Evelyn lounged lazily on the sofa. Exiting the game interface, she opened her [Speed Demons] chat group and transferred a hefty bonus. [Nice carry. Enjoy the spoils.]

Sebastian's avatar pinged immediately. [You drag us into your mess, then try to pay us off like hired help?]

Evelyn typed back, [What do you want then?]

[You.] Sebastian attached a winking kiss emoji.

Another notification popped up - Alexander's mountain landscape profile. [Boss, it's been weeks since you last visited headquarters.]

[Seconded!] Sebastian chimed in.

Evelyn sighed. [I'll drop by this week. Behave yourselves.]

Tucking her phone away, she rose to leave.

"Evelyn, wait!" Benjamin called out.

She paused mid-step. "Yes, Mr. Rivers?"

He approached awkwardly, avoiding eye contact. "Ahem! Why help me after everything?"

"Consider it repayment for earlier." She shrugged.

Benjamin scoffed. "Please. Someone like you didn't need my help. You'd have destroyed them either way."

"Flattering." Evelyn's lips quirked. Her gaze lingered on his bruised face. "Curious though - why not call your security when getting beaten on home turf?"

His jaw tightened. "They'd report to my father and brother. I don't need their interference."

Evelyn patted his shoulder. "Pride has no place in survival. Next time, swallow your ego and call for backup."

Benjamin flinched away. "I don't need life lessons from you!"

"Suit yourself." She turned to leave.

"Hold on!" He blocked her path, chin raised. "After today... I'm willing to be friends. You're decent at gaming."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Friends? After I 'stole' Nathaniel from your sister?"

"That sham marriage?" Benjamin snorted. "I know the truth. Nathaniel would never betray Amelia."

"Oh?" Evelyn crossed her arms. "And why isn't he married to her then?"

"Family politics." His expression darkened. "But make no mistake - you're just a temporary obstacle. Nathaniel married you to appease his grandfather. Don't develop feelings unless you enjoy heartbreak. The only woman he'll ever truly marry is my sister."
###Chapter 122

Evelyn couldn't shake Nathaniel's words from her mind. He'd been crystal clear during their three-month arrangement - she could have everything except his heart. That single condition spoke volumes about where his true affections lay.

Her lips twisted into a bitter smile. "Thanks for the offer, but I don't make friends with children." She turned on her heel, strolling away without a backward glance.

Benjamin's face flushed with indignation at the rejection. "Who are you calling a kid, Evelyn? I'm not a child!" He stomped after her, voice rising with each step. "I'm eighteen, for heaven's sake!"

Evelyn tuned out his protests, letting the boy trail her through the glittering ballroom. Her eyes scanned the crowd for any sign of Cassandra, but her stepsister remained frustratingly elusive. Giving up the search, she sank into a rattan swing chair near the floor-to-ceiling windows.

The view stole her breath. Moonlight bathed Silver Moon Estate's gardens in an ethereal glow, illuminating the rose bushes and dancing fountain. The entire property radiated understated elegance - not just expensive, but meticulously designed with artistic vision. No wonder the city's elite clamored to host events here.

Normally, Evelyn despised social gatherings. Yet something about this place stirred unfamiliar emotions in her chest.

"Evelyn! Are you even listening?" Benjamin's voice cut through her thoughts. He'd been rambling about friendship obligations and social etiquette for the past five minutes without taking a breath.

She ignored his tirade, gaze fixed on the full moon. "Benjamin," she interrupted suddenly. "You mentioned this estate holds special meaning for your family. What exactly?"

Despite her earlier rejection, Benjamin immediately brightened, thrilled she'd asked. "Father built this for my sister Celeste. She loved lively places, but the estate was too quiet most days. So he opened it for events to keep her memory alive." His voice softened. "Celeste... that was her name."

Evelyn's fingers tightened on the swing's ropes. "Celeste. Beautiful name." She hesitated before asking, "Was she Nathaniel's...?"

"No!" Benjamin shook his head vigorously. "I have two sisters. Nathaniel was with Amelia. Celeste was the eldest, but..." His expression clouded. "She disappeared when I was a baby. This estate is... well, it's more of a memorial now."

Evelyn's stomach dropped. "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have pried."

The boy's mood shifted like quicksilver, his sunny demeanor returning. "It's fine! We're friends, after all!"

Before Evelyn could correct him, hurried footsteps approached. Maxwell, the Rivers family butler, appeared looking harried. "Master Benjamin! There you are!"

Benjamin frowned. "What's the emergency?"

Maxwell's eyes widened at the bruise on the boy's face. "Good heavens! What happened to you?"
###Chapter 123

Benjamin casually wiped the blood from his split lip. "It's nothing. Just walked into a door by accident. Now, what was it you wanted to tell me?"

Maxwell fidgeted nervously. "Madam sent me to bring you home. Your university entrance exams are coming up. If you don't study harder, she's threatening to send you to military school."

A deep frown creased Benjamin's forehead.

Evelyn smirked. "Better run along now. Wouldn't want mommy to put you over her knee, would you?"

Benjamin's face flushed crimson at being humiliated in front of his new acquaintance. "Stop treating me like a child! I haven't been spanked since I was twelve!"

Maxwell gave Evelyn a curious look. He couldn't understand why Benjamin was hanging around this 'Mrs. Grayson' person he used to despise. And why was she dressed so impeccably today? But Benjamin's injury took priority. Even if the stubborn boy refused hospital treatment, the family doctor needed to examine him immediately. If anything happened to Benjamin, Maxwell would bear the full brunt of the family's wrath.

Without further delay, Maxwell grabbed Benjamin's arm. "Come on, sir! If we're late, your father will tan your hide even if your mother doesn't!"

Evelyn burst out laughing while Benjamin's composure shattered. He kicked Maxwell in frustration. "Shut your mouth! When have I ever been spanked?"

Maxwell backtracked quickly. "Of course, of course! My mistake! You've never been spanked!"

"Let go of me! I can walk by myself!" Benjamin snapped.

Evelyn thoroughly enjoyed watching Benjamin being dragged away against his will.

"Evelyn!" Cassandra's shrill voice cut through the air.

Turning, Evelyn saw her stepsister storming toward her like an angry bull. "So this is where you've been hiding! I've searched everywhere! Too lazy to do your job properly, so you came here to swing like a child?"

Evelyn remained unruffled. "I looked for you too but couldn't find you. Got tired, so I rested here."

Cassandra glared. "Get up this instant!"

Evelyn stood without protest.

Cassandra plopped onto the swing with an air of superiority. "Listen carefully. My godfather is introducing me to someone very important soon. You'll attend to my every need!"

'Godfather?' Evelyn raised an eyebrow. 'That middle-aged man she was cozying up to earlier?'

The godfather in question was Vincent Blackwood, a renowned film director attending the banquet to secure funding for his new project. He'd provided Cassandra's invitation and promised introductions to several high-profile investors. If any took a liking to her, her career would skyrocket.

The thought made Cassandra nervous. Having an assistant would boost her image. At least Evelyn's hideous outfit ensured she wouldn't steal the spotlight.

"Pay attention! You'll need to serve not just me, but pour drinks for the VIP too. He's a top-tier socialite!"

Evelyn nodded. "Understood. Who exactly are we meeting? Knowing might help me prepare better."

Cassandra preened. "Only the heir to one of the most powerful families - Nathaniel Grayson himself!"
###Chapter 124

Evelyn's brows knitted together at the mention of that name. "Do I really have to accompany you? Can't I just skip this?"

Cassandra took one look at Evelyn's reluctant expression and snapped sharply, "Know your place, Evelyn! As my assistant, you'll do whatever I tell you to! You can't just collect a fifteen-hundred-dollar salary and think you get to pick your assignments!"

Evelyn rubbed her temples. "Fine." The prospect of running into Nathaniel again made her head throb, but Cassandra showed no signs of letting her leave yet. 'I'll go. With this outfit, Nathaniel might not even recognize me.'

"Cassandra." The middle-aged man from earlier approached slowly. This was none other than Cassandra's so-called 'godfather'.

"Cassandra, Mr. Grayson and his associates are upstairs. Let me introduce you."

Cassandra sprang up from the swing chair eagerly. "Coming! Thank you, Vincent!"

Vincent smiled fondly at his 'goddaughter', but his expression soured when he noticed Evelyn trailing behind. "Who's this, Cassandra? And why is she dressed like that?"

Cassandra shot Evelyn a disdainful glance before explaining sweetly, "She's my assistant!"

The refined Vincent looked Evelyn up and down with undisguised contempt. "Why would you hire someone with such poor taste? It's embarrassing having someone like that follow you around. I'll find you a more presentable assistant next time!"

Cassandra shook her head. "She's from the countryside. I took pity on her when I saw her struggling to find work. It's really quite tragic."

Vincent was moved and immediately praised her. "You have such a kind heart."

Cassandra giggled coyly and linked arms with Vincent. "Don't worry about my assistant anymore, okay? Hurry up and introduce me to Mr. Grayson!"

"Of course, let's go now."

Evelyn watched Cassandra's performance with amusement before following them.

They left the bustling banquet hall and ascended to an elegant tea room where four distinguished men conversed casually around an antique tea table, while a professional tea master prepared their drinks.

Vincent led Cassandra forward and bowed respectfully. "Mr. Grayson, Mr. Prescott, Mr. Ford, and Mr. Blake! What an honor to find all four heirs of the great families gathered here!"

Dominic sipped tea leisurely from a porcelain cup and glanced up. "Ah, Vincent! What masterpieces are you working on this time?"

Vincent waved modestly. "Nothing yet! I'm planning a new film but haven't finalized the cast. I hope you'll forgive my boldness in asking if any of you might be interested in investing?"

Despite being an acclaimed director, Vincent knew his place among true blue-blooded capitalists. Investment required humility.

Dominic replied politely, "You're too modest! Your films consistently gross over ten million. I can't imagine you'd struggle for investors. You're clearly giving us an opportunity to profit!"

True, many wanted to invest, but most meddled with creative decisions. These young tycoons were different—generous and hands-off, unconcerned even if projects flopped.

Vincent shook his head humbly. "I could never compare to gentlemen like you! My earnings are mere pocket change to the four of you!"

Dominic noticed the woman beside Vincent and raised an eyebrow. "Is this your new leading lady, Vincent?"

Seizing the opportunity, Vincent presented Cassandra. "This is my goddaughter, Cassandra. A rising star and the lead in my next project."

Dominic smiled approvingly. "You have excellent taste, Vincent! Your leading ladies always possess unique charm and extraordinary beauty!"
###Chapter 125

Cassandra's heart swelled with pride at the unexpected compliment. Her gaze remained demurely lowered, as instructed by Vincent earlier - "Play up your youthful innocence, darling. These powerful men eat that up."

Vincent gave her shoulder an encouraging squeeze. "Cassandra, meet Mr. Dominic Prescott. Greet him properly."

"Hello, Mr. Prescott." She lifted her eyes just enough to flash a practiced, flirtatious smile. The sight that greeted her stole her breath away.

The man lounging before her possessed the kind of devastating good looks that made Hollywood's leading men seem ordinary. His rakish grin and careless elegance screamed old money and dangerous charm.

Vincent continued the introductions. "This is Mr. Harrison Ford, president of Lemington Group."

"How do you do, Mr. Ford?"

Harrison acknowledged her with a polite nod before returning to his tea.

"And our gracious host for tonight, Mr. Jonathan Blake."

"A pleasure, Mr. Blake."

Jonathan responded with a politician's polished smile.

With each introduction, Cassandra's pulse quickened. 'Holy hell! These aren't just billionaires - they're walking Greek gods!'

Finally, Vincent guided her toward the most imposing figure seated at the center. His tone became noticeably more respectful. "This is Mr. Nathaniel Grayson, CEO of Holden Group. Since you've just signed with his company, he's essentially your new boss."

"Mr. Grayson." Her voice caught as she finally faced the man she'd been dying to meet. When Cassandra dared to look up, her entire body went rigid with shock.

'This can't be the same Nathaniel I almost married! He's... otherworldly!'

Cold perfection carved from marble, with an aura of untouchable authority. The sharp angles of his aristocratic features looked too precise to be real. Only the slight flutter of his dark lashes convinced her he wasn't some celestial statue.

Nathaniel didn't even glance their way, engrossed in quiet conversation with Harrison. The blatant dismissal left both Cassandra and Vincent shifting uncomfortably.

Dominic broke the awkward silence with an easy smile. "Why don't you join us? Tell us about this exciting new project of yours."

"Oh! Th-thank you, Mr. Prescott."

Vincent motioned for Cassandra to sit while her assistant trailed behind like a shadow.

Evelyn kept her head bowed low, playing the perfect invisible servant. To any observer, she appeared properly submissive - afraid to even glance around the lavish room. In reality, she was desperately avoiding recognition. Every man here knew her face, especially Nathaniel. The last thing she needed was to be noticed.
###Chapter 126

Vincent Blackwood settled into his seat, launching into an animated pitch for his new film project, hoping to secure investments from the four powerful CEOs present.

Beside him, Cassandra sat quietly, her gaze drifting toward Nathaniel Grayson. The longer she stared at that impossibly handsome man, the more regret twisted inside her chest.

It could have been her.

Not long ago, she had nearly married him. The Grayson family’s bridal procession had already stepped into her home—yet somehow, fate had snatched that future away. The extravagant dowry still sat untouched in her family’s vault, a constant reminder of what she’d lost.

If only things had gone differently, she’d be Mrs. Grayson now, seated proudly beside Nathaniel, the envy of every woman in the room.

Lost in her bitter fantasies, she jerked when her elbow knocked over her teacup. Hot liquid splashed onto the designer gown she’d borrowed.

"Damn it!" Cassandra shot to her feet, frantically dabbing at the stain.

"Are you hurt?" Vincent asked, frowning.

"I'm fine," she muttered, flustered. Then she snapped at her assistant, "Evelyn! Get me tissues from my bag!"

"Of course."

Evelyn Whitmore had been standing silently in the corner, holding Cassandra’s purse. She kept her head down as she retrieved the tissues, her movements efficient but her mind seething.

She just had to say my full name. Please tell me Nathaniel didn’t hear that.

Evelyn prayed the common name wouldn’t draw attention.

But the moment Cassandra uttered "Evelyn," all four men at the table looked up sharply. Their eyes locked onto the assistant who had been trying so hard to stay invisible.

Dominic Prescott smirked. "Doesn’t that name ring a bell, Nathaniel?"

Evelyn wore a simple calico dress, her hair in two unassuming braids. Yet Nathaniel’s gaze burned into her with such intensity it could have scorched the fabric.

She felt it—the weight of his stare—but refused to meet his eyes. The last thing she needed was for the Blackwoods to connect her to Nathaniel.

Cassandra finally noticed the shift in the room. Her smile stiffened as she realized all four men were staring at Evelyn.

What the hell?

She’d deliberately dressed Evelyn like a peasant. How was she still stealing attention?

That little witch.

Forcing a laugh, Cassandra cut in. "Why is everyone staring at my assistant? Is her outfit that ridiculous?"

Nathaniel’s icy gaze slid to her. "She’s your assistant?"
###Chapter 127

"Yes, absolutely she is!" Cassandra responded with saccharine sweetness, her pulse racing wildly.

'Oh heavens! Nathaniel actually spoke to me! That deep, velvety voice could melt glaciers... But damn it all, he only acknowledged me to ask about Evelyn!'

At Cassandra's confirmation, Nathaniel's expression darkened instantly. His stormy gaze locked onto Evelyn with unmistakable displeasure.

Dominic swiveled in his chair, eyeing his longtime friend with amused curiosity. Though unaware of the couple's complicated history, he never missed a chance to tease Nathaniel's wife. A mischievous grin spread across his face. "Tell me, darling, do you possess the art of tea ceremony?"

Evelyn kept her eyes downcast as she shook her head.

Cassandra's perfectly plucked eyebrows knitted together, irritation bubbling beneath her polished exterior. "Mister Prescott," she interjected with forced cheer, "my assistant comes from rural origins. Just look at her dreadful attire - she clearly lacks refinement for such cultured pursuits as specialty tea preparation!"

Dominic waved a dismissive hand. "All the better! We're thoroughly bored with professionals. A novice's attempt would be delightfully entertaining."

Cassandra blinked in confusion. She'd deliberately dressed Evelyn in the most unflattering outfit possible, with garish makeup to match. What possible allure could these elite men see in her?

With Dominic's insistence, Cassandra had no recourse. She turned to Evelyn with a venomous smile that didn't reach her eyes. "Well? Don't just stand there gaping when Mister Prescott shows you such consideration. Get up there and make yourself useful!"

Though reluctant, Evelyn had little choice. With quiet resignation, she approached the tea station as the professional brewer stepped aside. She knew exactly what game Dominic was playing - this was deliberate humiliation disguised as opportunity.

Her movements were precise as she prepared the tea with surprising competence, pouring four perfect servings without once meeting anyone's gaze. The first cup she presented to Nathaniel, who occupied the central position.

Just as the porcelain neared the table, Nathaniel's large hand intercepted hers. What appeared as a polite gesture to accept the cup became a silent battle - his calloused fingers pressing insistently against hers on the delicate china.

"Look at me." His command was deceptively calm, carrying an edge of steel.

Evelyn refused to comply, attempting to withdraw her hand from the teacup's imprisonment.

The last thing she wanted was Cassandra discovering their connection. Already, she could see the dawning suspicion in her stepsister's eyes as Nathaniel's intense focus on Evelyn became impossible to ignore.

Cassandra's voice cut through the tension. "Mister Grayson, why are you staring at my assistant so intently? Do you two know each other?"

Nathaniel's gaze never wavered from Evelyn as he parted his lips to respond.
###Chapter 128

"Absolutely not!" Evelyn answered before Nathaniel could. "Why would someone like me know an important man like Mister Grayson? I'm completely beneath his notice!" She yanked her hand back with all her strength.

The sudden movement tipped the teacup, sending hot liquid splashing across Nathaniel's hand. His skin turned an angry red from the scalding.

"Evelyn! What's wrong with you? Can't you even serve tea properly?" Cassandra shrieked, shoving Evelyn aside to fuss over Nathaniel's injury.

"Does it hurt, Mister Grayson? I'm so sorry about my incompetent assistant. I'll make sure she's properly punished!"

Nathaniel withdrew his hand coldly, avoiding Cassandra's touch. He shook off the remaining tea droplets with deliberate calm, accepted a tissue from the waiter, and methodically dabbed at his skin. His piercing gaze never left Evelyn's face throughout the entire ordeal, not even flinching from the pain. After a weighted pause, he remarked icily, "She certainly deserves punishment."

Cassandra flushed at the rejection but quickly turned her embarrassment into fury. "Don't just stand there, Evelyn! Get on your knees and apologize to Mister Grayson this instant!"

Evelyn gave a stiff bow. "My apologies, Mister Grayson. It was an accident."

Nathaniel's expression remained unreadable, though the dangerous glint in his eyes sent shivers down Evelyn's spine.

The other men at the table observed the scene with detached amusement, sipping their tea like spectators at a private performance.

The tension grew suffocating. Vincent Blackwood shifted uncomfortably - offending Nathaniel Grayson was unthinkable. He shot Cassandra a meaningful look.

Taking the hint, Cassandra waved Evelyn away with disgust. "Enough! Mister Grayson wouldn't waste his time with some country bumpkin like you. Since you can't even handle simple tasks, stay away from the table. Get out before you ruin his mood further!"

Truthfully, Cassandra wouldn't have minded seeing Evelyn suffer Nathaniel's wrath. But as her assistant, any offense would reflect poorly on Cassandra herself. Better to remove the problem entirely.

Besides, Evelyn's mere presence irritated her. Dressed in those hideous clothes yet still managing to draw attention - it was intolerable.

Evelyn nearly sighed in relief at the dismissal. With a quick nod, she turned and walked away without hesitation.

Finally free from that oppressive atmosphere.

The VIP tea room was expansive. Aside from Nathaniel's party and a few discreet wait staff, the space stood empty.

Evelyn spotted an isolated mahogany sofa in a quiet corner. Perfect. She settled onto the plush cushions and pulled out her phone, losing herself in a mobile game.

Suddenly, a tall glass of orange juice appeared before her, held by a well-manicured hand.

Evelyn looked up in surprise to find Jonathan Blake smiling down at her, his handsome features alight with amusement.
###Chapter 129

"Long time no see, Evelyn," the man said smoothly.

Evelyn's first instinct was to glance at Nathaniel. He was sipping his tea with deliberate calm, his attention deliberately avoiding her. Across the room, Cassandra and Vincent were engrossed in conversation, their laughter light and effortless as if they shared some private joke. Their voices carried clearly, though they made no effort to include her.

She turned back to Christopher and gave a polite nod, declining the glass of orange juice he offered. "I appreciate it, but I'm not thirsty."

Christopher's smile didn't waver. He set the glass down on the coffee table with practiced grace before settling into the seat beside her.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Mind telling me why you're here?"

"Nothing in particular," he replied, leaning back. "Film investments don't interest me much. Thought I'd find a quieter corner."

"Suit yourself." She dropped her gaze back to her phone, fingers tapping absently at her game.

Christopher exhaled, amused yet slightly unnerved.

He was used to attention—had thrived on it since he was old enough to understand his own charm. But Evelyn? She treated him like background noise.

It was... intriguing.

His gaze lingered on her profile before he finally spoke again. "Correct me if I'm wrong, but you and Nathaniel don’t exactly act like a typical couple."

Evelyn paused mid-tap and lifted her eyes. "Define 'typical.'"

His smirk deepened. "At the very least, most couples don’t act like strangers sharing the same air."

A slow, knowing smile curved her lips. "Maybe that’s just how we operate. You wouldn’t understand—being single and all."

Christopher's amusement faltered for a fraction of a second before he recovered. Sharp. Very sharp.

Evelyn tilted her head toward Vincent. "Speaking of, you know him?"

Christopher followed her gaze. "Vincent Blackwood? One of the most sought-after directors in the industry. Arrogant, but talented. Only works on high-budget projects—and they always pay off."

"What about his personal life?"

"Not much. His wife and kids live overseas."

"Good to know." She resumed her game without another word.

That was all she needed.

Cassandra rubbing shoulders with a director like Vincent? No way that was coincidence.

Evelyn’s fingers moved faster across the screen.

Sebastian could dig deeper later.

But one thing was clear—Victoria and Cassandra had skeletons.

And she was going to find every last one.
###Chapter 130

Jonathan swirled the amber liquid in his glass, studying Evelyn with an unreadable expression. "Tell me, Evelyn," he began, his voice smooth as velvet, "why would the esteemed Mrs. Grayson choose to work as a celebrity's assistant? Doesn't Nathaniel provide for you adequately?"

Evelyn didn't look up from her phone, fingers flying across the screen in a mobile game. "It's personal enrichment," she replied dismissively. "Money has nothing to do with it."

The amusement faded from Jonathan's striking features. "I'm genuinely concerned about you. If you're facing difficulties, I could—"

"Help me?" Evelyn interrupted with a dry chuckle, finally locking her phone. She fixed him with a piercing gaze, her emerald eyes glittering with mischief. "How very gallant of you, Sir Jonathan. But let's see if you mean it."

Jonathan blinked at the unexpected title. "Within reason, of course."

"Oh, this is perfectly reasonable." Evelyn leaned forward, resting her chin on her palm. "Those three Vivian Sterling paintings I saw in your collection last week—I want them."

Jonathan's smile faltered. He'd meant to probe her situation, not find himself cornered.

"Fascinating," he murmured, recovering with a lazy grin. "But tell me, darling assistant, where would you get that kind of money? Running to Nathaniel for funds?" His eyes sharpened. "And why would he allow his wife to play assistant if he could easily support you?"

Evelyn's expression cooled. "My finances are none of your concern. Just answer the question—will you sell?"

"Not for any price."

Her face fell momentarily before she schooled her features. Those paintings were her mother's early works, irreplaceable pieces of family history she longed to reclaim.

Jonathan watched her carefully before adding, "Though I might gift them... under certain conditions."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. "Name them."

His laughter rang out, rich and warm. "One drink. That's all I ask in exchange for three masterpieces."

She recoiled slightly. "Not tonight."

"Ah." Jonathan's knowing smirk returned. "Because your husband's here?"

Evelyn didn't answer. Though their marriage was contractual, Nathaniel maintained strict appearances. Any hint of impropriety—especially with a notorious charmer like Jonathan—would breach their agreement.

The unspoken tension between them crackled like static before a storm.
###Chapter 131

If Evelyn shared a drink with another man, it would be like stepping directly into Nathaniel's warzone. The fallout would be catastrophic—there was no way she could risk it.

After a tense pause, Evelyn attempted to negotiate with Christopher. "How about another time? I'll drink with you as much as you want then."

Christopher didn't budge. "No deal. It's now or never. Time doesn't wait for anyone—especially not for women."

Damn him.

Evelyn flushed slightly and glanced at Nathaniel. He was still sipping his tea, his back turned, completely indifferent to her predicament.

She turned back to Christopher, her resolve hardening. "Just to be clear—if I drink with you, you'll give me Vivian Sterling's works for free, right?"

Christopher smirked, nodding without hesitation. "The moment you do, they're yours."

Evelyn stole another glance at Nathaniel. Still facing away, his posture was relaxed, as if he couldn't care less about what she did.

If she acted fast, maybe he wouldn't notice.

Determined, she reached for the glass of orange juice on the table. "Fine. Let's drink."

Christopher blinked, surprised by her sudden agreement. She must really want those paintings. Who is Vivian Sterling to her?

Seeing the fierce determination in Evelyn's delicate features, his lips curved into a half-smile. Intrigued, he lifted his teacup, slowly bringing it toward her glass.

Their cups clinked softly.

As they leaned in, their gazes locked—

"I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid—To take a stand, to take a stand—It's been a ride—Everybody—"

Her phone blared, shattering the moment.

Evelyn jerked back, nearly dropping her glass. The screen flashed—Nathaniel Grayson.

Did he see me?

Her blood turned to ice.

She spun around—and met Nathaniel's piercing glare. The entire room had gone silent, all eyes on her, including Cassandra's.

Cassandra shot her a disapproving look, clearly annoyed by the interruption.

Nathaniel's expression was unreadable as he pressed the phone to his ear, his gaze never leaving hers.

She had no choice.

Swallowing hard, Evelyn answered.

"Come here." His voice was dangerously calm.

If she responded—or worse, obeyed—Cassandra would realize they knew each other. The entire Whitmore family would find out, and her carefully constructed peace would shatter.

Steeling herself, Evelyn turned to Christopher. "Excuse me. I need to take this."

She set down her glass and strode out of the room. Once she was far enough, she hissed into the phone, "I'm not coming back in! If you have something to say, meet me outside!"
###Chapter 132

The tension in the tea room dissolved the moment Evelyn stepped out, though Vincent's displeasure was evident at having his pitch interrupted. Dismissing the earlier incident with the rude assistant, he refocused on presenting his screenplay to Nathaniel, Dominic, and Harrison.

Cassandra played the perfect hostess, leaning forward to refill the executives' teacups. She lingered noticeably longer when pouring Nathaniel's drink.

Without warning, he stood abruptly. "Excuse me."

Nathaniel's expression darkened when he exited and found no sign of Evelyn.

At the VIP restroom near the tea room entrance, the door swung open suddenly. Evelyn peeked out. "In here," she said before retreating inside, leaving the door ajar.

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed as he strode forward, entering before slamming the door shut behind him.

Tilting her head up to meet his gaze, Evelyn kept her voice even. "Whatever you need to say, say it here."

His piercing stare held mocking amusement. "Pretending not to know me earlier?"

Her lips twitched. "Given our different social circles, I didn't see the need for public recognition."

"No need?" His voice dropped dangerously.

Evelyn nodded. "You only married me to appease your family. I'll play my part when we're with them, but here? No performance required."

Nathaniel's cold laugh sent chills down her spine. "Embarrassed by me? Or afraid people will discover you're tied to someone beneath you?"

"Hardly." She met his gaze steadily. "Your status elevates anyone associated with you. I simply prefer keeping our temporary arrangement private. Consider it compensation for my cooperation with your family."

For two heartbeats, silence stretched between them. Then his deep voice rumbled, "If that's what you want."

Relief washed over her. "Thank you for understanding."

This agreement lifted a weight from her shoulders - no more worrying about unwanted attention.

Suddenly, his fingers gripped her chin, forcing her to meet his stormy gaze. "Now explain what happened in there."

Evelyn's breath hitched. "What do you mean?"

His eyes turned glacial. "Your little performance before leaving."

"I was drinking juice!" she protested.

Nathaniel's eyebrow arched skeptically. "Juice? Was sharing a glass with another man necessary?"
###Chapter 133

"He noticed me after all..."

Before Evelyn could fabricate an excuse, Nathaniel closed the distance between them with predatory grace. His voice carried a dangerous edge. "Didn't I explicitly warn you about accepting drinks from strangers? Or did my words mean nothing to you?"

The height difference forced Evelyn to crane her neck uncomfortably. "I remember perfectly well—"

Nathaniel captured her chin with surprising gentleness, his thumb and forefinger tilting her face upward. His gaze burned with quiet intensity. "Then explain this disobedience."

Evelyn squirmed under his scrutiny. "It's not what it looks like—"

His expression remained impassive, but storm clouds gathered in his eyes. "Enlighten me. How should a husband react when his wife shares drinks with another man?"

Trapped, Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Christopher has something I need!"

Nathaniel's grip shifted almost imperceptibly. "What could possibly justify this?"

Though reluctant to reveal her vulnerabilities, Evelyn saw no alternative. "There are three paintings in his private collection. He refused to sell them... unless I drank with him."

Nathaniel released her abruptly. "Name the pieces. There's no need for such theatrics."

Evelyn's lashes fluttered downward. "Our arrangement is temporary. I won't burden you with my personal affairs."

A muscle twitched in Nathaniel's jaw. "Consider it part of our contract. Anything you desire is yours—except my heart."

Evelyn met his gaze with startling clarity. "Every transaction creates obligation. Favors breed entanglement. I prefer clean exits when our time ends."

His frown deepened. "You're remarkably eager for our separation."

While other women schemed to claim him, she treated their union like a prison sentence.

Evelyn's lips curved into a dangerous smile. Rising on tiptoes, she draped her arms around his neck with deliberate provocation. "Would you prefer dependence? Or does self-sufficiency threaten you more?"

Nathaniel didn't retreat. His hooded gaze tracked her every movement with predatory focus.

The disguise should have repelled him—the garish yellowed complexion, artificial freckles, and ridiculous braids. Yet her eyes remained luminous, her lashes casting moonlit shadows. The very lips taunting him looked unbearably tempting.

A visible swallow traveled down his throat.

When her attempt to disgust him failed spectacularly, Evelyn faltered. "Nathaniel...?"

The smoldering hunger in his eyes sent panic skittering down her spine. She tried to retreat, but Nathaniel's hands locked around her waist, crushing her against his chest.

Their breaths tangled as he studied her flustered expression. Some invisible thread pulled them closer, the air between them crackling with tension.
###Chapter 134

The sudden ringtone of "Fight Song" shattered the tense moment between Evelyn and Nathaniel.

She blinked, snapping out of the haze. The charged atmosphere evaporated instantly.

Meeting Nathaniel's dark, intense gaze made her skin prickle. She took an awkward step back, fumbling for her phone.

Cassandra's name flashed on the screen. Before Evelyn could answer, her half-sister's shrill voice pierced through the bathroom door.

"I know you're hiding in there, Evelyn! That awful ringtone is unmistakable! Get out here now! Stop slacking off!"

Evelyn's lips twisted in annoyance. She glanced up at Nathaniel and shrugged. "You heard her. Duty calls."

Nathaniel remained motionless, his expression unreadable.

She tried to slip past him, pausing to add, "Stay here for a minute. If she sees us together, there'll be questions."

His arm shot out, pulling her flush against his chest. The sudden movement made her gasp.

His breath was hot against her ear as he growled, "No drinking with other men."

The command sent shivers down her spine. "Understood," she managed to reply.

Even without seeing his face, she felt the raw possessiveness radiating from him.

But she knew better. This wasn't about desire - just his damn control issues.

The realization left a bitter taste in her mouth. Like a stone sinking to the bottom of a lake, the weight of it settled heavily in her chest.

Evelyn pushed through the bathroom door.

Cassandra stood with arms crossed, tapping her designer heels impatiently. "Finally! Do you think I pay you to hide in bathrooms?"

Evelyn stretched lazily. "It's 10:30. My shift ended half an hour ago."

"Your shift?" Cassandra scoffed. "You think you can just walk out? You still need to apologize properly to Nathaniel for scalding him!"

"I already did. If he needs ointment, I'll buy some." Evelyn rolled her shoulders. "I told you I didn't want to come. You forced me to pour tea."

Cassandra's mouth opened and closed like a fish.

Yawning, Evelyn turned toward the stairs. "I'm done for tonight. See you tomorrow."

"Get back here!" Cassandra shrieked, stomping her foot. "Evelyn Whitmore, I'm not finished with you!"

Evelyn didn't even glance back as she descended the stairs. Not worth the effort.

Cassandra's nails dug into her palms. If she wasn't waiting for Vincent, she'd drag that country bumpkin back by her hair. Motherless brat!

Muttering curses, Cassandra spun around - and froze.

Nathaniel emerged from the bathroom, his tailored suit impeccable, his expression unreadable.
###Chapter 135

Cassandra froze at the sight of Nathaniel. "What the hell? Why did Nathaniel come out right after that witch Evelyn left? Were they both in there together?"

The realization hit her like a punch to the gut. Her expression twisted with disbelief before settling into sharp suspicion. Nathaniel had been watching Evelyn strangely during tea service earlier. And Evelyn? That little seductress knew exactly how to wrap men around her finger. That spilled tea incident was clearly staged to get his attention.

The thought sent white-hot pain through Cassandra's chest. She needed answers. Forcing a sweet smile, she approached Nathaniel with calculated steps. "Mr. Grayson, my assistant just left that restroom. Isn't it curious you exited right after her? Did you two... share the space?"

"Your assistant?" Nathaniel's glacial gaze swept over her. Three icy words dropped like stones. "Didn't see her."

'Didn't see her?' His dismissive tone sent chills down her spine but stoked her anger. He must have entered while she was confronting Evelyn. Men did take less time in restrooms, after all.

Of course someone of Nathaniel's status wouldn't share facilities with a country nobody like Evelyn. Cassandra mentally kicked herself for the ridiculous assumption.

Her smile returned, practiced and perfect. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear with feigned shyness. "I'm terribly sorry about my assistant burning you earlier. Please, let me make it up to you. Maybe I could take you to dinner? If you'd just give me your number—"

"Unnecessary." Nathaniel strode past without breaking step, his broad shoulders cutting through the space between them.

"Mr. Grayson, wait!" Cassandra hurried after him, heels clicking urgently. "I insist—"

He didn't pause. Didn't glance back. His rejection was absolute.

Recognizing the danger in pushing further, Cassandra stopped dead. She'd find another opportunity. There would be other chances to close this distance.

Rooted in place, she drank in the sight of his retreating form—tall, commanding, every inch the aristocrat. Hunger twisted her features.

Nathaniel Grayson embodied everything a first-tier heir should be. Wealth. Power. Breathtaking looks. Yet what truly captivated her was his restraint—how he'd brushed off the scalding without retaliation. That cold exterior only proved he wasn't some playboy. The woman who cracked that shell would be treasured beyond measure.

Agony lanced through her. Such perfection... already claimed by another. The injustice burned like acid in her veins.

She'd been so close. So damn close to being his wife.
###Chapter 136

Nathaniel returned to the tea room and lingered for a while longer.

Vincent kept rambling about his new movie script. The entire time, he'd been talking to himself since the other four were engrossed in their own conversation. Not once did any of them actually pay attention to him.

'Guess I'm not getting any investors today,' Vincent thought bitterly.

He checked his watch helplessly. Keeping them any longer might just annoy them further. With no other choice, he stood up, made some polite excuses, and left the room with Cassandra.

Once they were alone, Dominic smirked. "So Nathaniel, where's that lovely wife of yours?"

Christopher raised an eyebrow. "Yes, Nathaniel. Where's Evelyn?"

'Evelyn? Since when is Christopher on first-name basis with her?' Nathaniel thought.

He arched a brow at the man. "Do you need something from her?"

Dominic grinned. "Just curious why she's working as a celebrity assistant. Come on, man. She's your wife. Shouldn't you be spoiling her rotten?"

Nathaniel took a slow sip of tea. "She enjoys experiencing different lifestyles. I won't interfere with her choices."

Dominic feigned shock. "Damn, Nathaniel! Never knew you could be so... accommodating!"

Nathaniel shot him a icy glare. "Go to hell."

Christopher chuckled. "I was just joking with Evelyn earlier. Didn't expect her to take me seriously and drink with me. You're not upset, are you?"

Nathaniel studied Christopher for a long moment before giving a tight smile. "Not at all. She's young and impulsive. I understand completely."

Christopher's smile faltered. 'Is he calling me childish?'

The atmosphere turned tense. Dominic and Harrison exchanged glances, sensing the sudden friction between the two childhood friends.

Dominic quickly intervened. "Hey Christopher, since it's your first official day taking over the family business, why don't you treat us to drinks?"

Christopher forced a laugh. "Sure. Pick the place."

Dominic nudged Nathaniel. "So, where should we go?"

Nathaniel set down his teacup. "You guys go ahead. I have other plans."

Dominic frowned. "Come on, man! It's been ages since all four of us hung out together."

"Next time," Nathaniel said firmly, slipping on his jacket. He gave them a casual wave without turning around. "Later."

Dominic sighed dramatically. "Marriage changes a man!"

Christopher watched Nathaniel leave with a tight smile. "He must be busy."

Harrison stood up. "Let's go. I've got some premium whiskey at Twilight."

Christopher protested, "I said I'm paying tonight!"

Dominic laughed. "I don't care who pays as long as the drinks keep coming!"

In the car...

"I asked you to arrange a job for her. This is what you came up with?" Nathaniel's voice was deceptively calm, but the edge in his tone was unmistakable.
###Chapter 137

A shiver ran down Lucas's back. He glanced toward the rear seat and explained nervously, "Sir, there was an urgent company matter I had to handle, so I couldn't accompany Miss Evelyn to the branch office. I did inform Mister Whitmore before leaving, and he confirmed Miss Evelyn insisted on bringing her own assistant."

Nathaniel's brow creased as he remained silent. Lucas couldn't decipher his boss's emotions from that impassive expression.

Cautiously, Lucas added, "I'll assign Miss Evelyn lighter duties starting tomorrow."

Still, Nathaniel showed no reaction. His voice was flat when he finally spoke. "Leave her be. If this is what she chose, let her experience it."

"Yes, sir," Lucas replied.

"Check Jonathan's gallery for any Vivian Sterling paintings. Purchase all available pieces. She wants them," Nathaniel ordered.

Lucas committed the task to memory. "Understood. I'll handle it immediately."

"Oh, and sir—Miss Amelia's treatment is concluding soon. She'll likely return next month."

Nathaniel's eyes darkened. He pinched the bridge of his nose and exhaled. "Noted."

Relieved to escape reprimand, Lucas focused ahead until something caught his attention. "Sir, isn't that Miss Evelyn over there?"

Nathaniel's gaze followed Lucas's pointing finger.

There she was—Evelyn, alone at a street vendor, devouring a skewer of grilled meat.

'Is she just having dinner now?' Nathaniel thought, checking his watch.

Lucas signaled the driver to pull over. "Sir, the celebrity Evelyn's assisting is Cassandra Blackwood. Known for being exceptionally demanding and abusing her privileges. I suspect Miss Evelyn had no time to eat properly today."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "Bring her here."

"Yes, sir." Lucas stepped out but returned moments later, awkwardly bending to the window. "She says she's not finished eating and you should... 'go do whatever you want'. Her exact words."

Nathaniel's expression turned stormy. After a tense pause, he exited the vehicle himself.

Evelyn was sipping soda when Nathaniel's shadow fell over her. From his towering position, he might have resembled a loan shark if not for his striking features.

"Two more skewers, please!" Evelyn called to the vendor, completely ignoring him.

"I'm not hungry," Nathaniel stated coldly.

Evelyn looked up, amused. "Who said they're for you? I'm still starving!"

Nathaniel's lips pressed into a thin line.

His imposing presence created an awkward atmosphere around the humble food stall. Other customers gaped at the impeccably dressed executive standing beside plastic stools.

Evelyn's appetite visibly waned. "Either sit down and eat or stop looming over me like some grim reaper. You're ruining everyone's dinner."

Nathaniel's scowl deepened.

Meanwhile, Lucas watched in awe. In his decade of service, nobody had ever spoken to Nathaniel Grayson with such audacity.
###Chapter 138

Nathaniel's chair screeched across the pavement as he kicked it into position. His icy glare locked onto Evelyn.

She continued eating, unfazed by his mood. Mid-chew, an idea sparked in her mind.

Holding out her skewer toward Nathaniel's lips, she wiggled her eyebrows playfully. "Taste it."

The unexpected offer caught him off guard. Against his better judgment, he parted his lips slightly-

Evelyn yanked the skewer back and shoved the entire bite into her own mouth.

"Oops," she mumbled through full cheeks, eyes dancing with mischief. "Thought you weren't hungry?"

Nathaniel's expression darkened instantly. "You're playing games with me?"

With an exaggerated sigh, Evelyn plucked a fresh fry from the basket. "Fine, no more teasing. Sharing food is... intimate. And unsanitary. Here, try this one instead."

Nathaniel eyed her suspiciously before accepting the offering.

Just as he raised it to his mouth, Lucas came barreling over. "Sir! You can't eat that street vendor garbage!"

Evelyn shot him a withering look. "It won't kill him."

Lucas's eye twitched. While Evelyn could stomach questionable street food, Nathaniel had never consumed anything outside five-star establishments. The potential digestive consequences terrified him.

"Sir-"

Nathaniel silenced him with a sharp gesture.

Taking a careful bite, Nathaniel chewed with aristocratic precision.

Evelyn leaned in, nose almost touching his. "Well? Amazing, right?"

"Acceptable," Nathaniel conceded.

"Told you!" Evelyn beamed, delighted at corrupting his refined palate. "But you eat like a Victorian maiden at her first ball. Street food demands enthusiasm!" She demonstrated by taking an exaggerated bite.

Nathaniel's jaw tightened at the 'maiden' comment.

Yet watching Evelyn devour her food with such unbridled joy sparked something unexpected. Her authenticity stood in stark contrast to the calculated femininity he usually encountered.

"Evelyn! Your extra skewers!" The vendor woman approached, her eyes widening at Nathaniel. "My, my! This one's even more striking than the last. You collect handsome men like trading cards!"

Evelyn grinned. "He cleans up nicely."

The vendor retrieved a soda from her cooler. "For you, handsome. First-time customer special. Bring this pretty girl back often!"

Nathaniel opened his mouth to decline the unfamiliar beverage.

"We'll be back every week!" Evelyn answered for him, accepting the drink with both hands.

The vendor winked before returning to her cart.

Nathaniel stared at the condensation-beaded can. "I didn't-"

"Relax," Evelyn interrupted, popping the tab with a fizzy hiss. "Live a little." She pushed the drink toward him, foam bubbling over the rim. "Welcome to the real world, Nathaniel Grayson."
###Chapter 139

Nathaniel's gaze sharpened. "You know the owner well?"

Evelyn nodded. "Yeah. We used to come here for dinner all the time."

"We?"

"Mm-hmm. My friends and I."

A memory flickered in his mind—the owner mentioning he was better-looking than the last guy Evelyn had brought here. Did that mean she made a habit of bringing guys around? Who were they?

Nathaniel's brow furrowed. "Friends? Or exes?"

Evelyn answered honestly. "Nope. Never had a boyfriend before, so no exes. Just classmates and childhood friends."

His dark eyes darkened further. "Classmates? The one who gave you his button?"

"No, not him," Evelyn replied automatically, then froze. "Wait. How do you know about the button?"

Nathaniel's expression turned icy. "Unfortunately, I was there to witness it."

Evelyn thought back—graduation day, walking with Nathaniel when a junior had stopped her in the hallway, asking to talk.

Ah. So he saw that.

"He was just a junior. We barely talk. The button was just a friendship thing. Honestly, I didn’t even know gifting buttons was a trend until he did it."

A flicker of amusement crossed Nathaniel's face. "So you don’t know what it means?"

Evelyn blinked. "There’s a meaning?" She grabbed her phone. "Let me check—"

Nathaniel caught her wrist before she could search. "Don’t bother. It’s not important. Finish eating. We’re leaving."

"…Okay."

His odd behavior puzzled her, but she shrugged it off and focused on her meal.

By the time she finished, she was stuffed. The day’s stress—Cassandra’s torment, the hunger—had made her eat more than usual. Her stomach felt like a balloon.

She gripped the table to stand, but Nathaniel extended his hand.

Evelyn hesitated, then took it. His grip was firm, calloused but careful, holding her just tight enough that she couldn’t pull away.

"Thanks," she murmured, trying to slip free, but Nathaniel kept hold, leading her toward the car.

Flustered, she protested, "Wait! I haven’t paid!"

Nathaniel signaled Lucas, who handled the bill.

Evelyn’s pulse fluttered as Nathaniel’s hand stayed wrapped around hers. Warm. Secure. Unyielding.

"Look at that guy—so handsome! Picking up his girlfriend?"

"Ugh, lucky her. He’s gorgeous and attentive?"

Evelyn ignored the whispers, but her cheeks burned.
###Chapter 140

Evelyn's cheeks flushed at the murmurs surrounding them. The way Nathaniel gripped her hand made them appear like lovers to onlookers.

But their dynamic told a different story. Nathaniel strode ahead while she trailed reluctantly behind.

This wasn't romantic. If anything, it resembled a stern father dragging his rebellious daughter.

The misunderstanding unsettled Evelyn. Their relationship was purely transactional - a temporary charade. She attempted to free her hand to dispel any illusions.

Before she could pull away, they reached the car.

Nathaniel released her and opened the passenger door. "Get in," his deep voice rumbled.

Evelyn ducked inside without hesitation. Nathaniel's hand appeared above her head, shielding her from the car's frame. The unexpectedly chivalrous gesture surprised her.

'Cold yet courteous,' she mused.

As the car pulled away, Evelyn relaxed into the seat. "Thank you, Nathaniel."

He glanced up from his phone, brow arched. "For?"

"Dinner," she clarified sincerely. She'd intended to pay, but Nathaniel had maintained his grip, instructing Lucas to settle the bill instead.

Nathaniel returned to his screen without comment, dismissing the trivial matter.

Evelyn produced a tube of burn cream. "Give me your hand."

His gaze snapped back to her. "Why?"

"I noticed this at the pharmacy earlier," she explained, waving the tube. "That tea spill was my fault. I take responsibility."

"Unnecessary," Nathaniel dismissed coldly. The minor redness had already faded from memory.

Ignoring his refusal, Evelyn seized his hand. The lingering pink mark made her frown. She squeezed cream onto her fingertip, applying it with featherlight touches. "I truly didn't mean to scald you. I'm sorry."

Nathaniel stilled, observing her concentrated expression. An unfamiliar warmth spread through his chest at her unexpected concern.

His lips quirked. "Voluntary apologies? That's new."

"When I'm wrong, I admit it," Evelyn said matter-of-factly. "Burns hurt terribly. This cream helps."

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "How would you know? Have you been burned before?"
###Chapter 141

Burn wounds were the worst. Not the sharp, sudden pain of a cut, but a slow, relentless agony that refused to fade into the background.

Evelyn nodded. "Living in the countryside meant doing everything myself—chopping wood, starting fires, boiling water. The first time I tried, I burned my hand so badly I couldn't sleep all night."

Nathaniel's brows drew together. Without realizing it, concern darkened his gaze. "How old were you when this started?"

"I don't remember," Evelyn replied softly.

Childhood memories were a locked door she rarely opened. If the topic ever surfaced, she'd shut it down immediately.

Nathaniel rested his hand on her head, petting her like a stray kitten. "Was your childhood difficult?"

"Not particularly."

Pity made Evelyn bristle. She shoved his hand away with a scowl. "You probably don't know about my family situation, but you should understand this—they're vultures. If they find out about us, you'll be dragged into their mess too. I doubt you'd want that. So let's keep this arrangement between us."

The medicinal stench of burn cream soured his mood further. His eyes narrowed dangerously. "Is someone in your family giving you trouble? If you need—"

"I don't," Evelyn cut in sharply. "My family is my problem. In three months, this arrangement ends and we go back to being strangers. No need for unnecessary entanglements."

Nathaniel's expression turned glacial.

'How eager is she for that day to come?' he thought bitterly. 'Strangers again—does she truly regret ever meeting me?'

Withdrawing his hand, his voice dropped to a frigid murmur. "You overestimate my interest in your affairs, Miss Whitmore."

Evelyn rolled her eyes, snapping the cream's lid shut. "Apply this twice daily. The burn should heal within a week."

When Nathaniel made no move to take it, she jammed the tube into his pocket herself.

Silence thickened between them.

The car pulled into the Grayson estate. They exited wordlessly, retreating to separate rooms—no need for marital pretenses without Margaret around.

Nathaniel spent the night chain-smoking in his study while Evelyn slept soundly.

Morning came with the shrill ring of her phone. Still half-asleep, she fumbled for the device.

Gregory's roar blasted through the receiver. "Evelyn Whitmore! What the hell have you done?"

Blinking groggily, she mumbled, "Done what?"

"You ruined your sister's movie deal!" he thundered. "Get your ass home now! Have you lost your damn mind?"

No questions needed. Cassandra had clearly spun her tale. "Understood. I'll be there shortly."

The call disconnected.

Evelyn sat up, rubbing sleep from her eyes.

This was predictable. Cassandra must've raced home to poison Gregory's ear with embellished grievances. Again.
###Chapter 142

Evelyn returned to the Whitmore residence.

"Father, I'm home," Evelyn said softly.

Victoria immediately rushed to block her at the entrance. "Evelyn, you shouldn't go inside right now. Gregory is furious with you."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Aunt Victoria, what happened? Why is he angry?"

Victoria deliberately raised her voice. "He found out how you offended the investors for Cassandra's new film project. You should leave now - I'm trying to protect you. He might lose control and hurt you!"

Evelyn watched Victoria's performance with amusement.

'If this woman truly cared, she would have warned me before I arrived. This dramatic act at the door is so transparent.'

Yet Gregory always fell for it.

"Is that Evelyn?" Gregory's enraged voice boomed from inside. "Get her in here now!"

Victoria stopped blocking the doorway and hurried back to Gregory.

"Darling, calm down. What's done is done. Hurting her won't change what happened to Cassandra."

Her words only stoked Gregory's fury. Spotting a broom nearby, he grabbed it. "That ungrateful brat needs to learn her lesson! How else can I make up for what she's done to you and Cassandra?"

Evelyn stepped into the living room. The scene unfolded before her - Gregory brandishing the broom, Victoria pretending to restrain him while actually provoking him further, and Cassandra dramatically sobbing on the couch, shoulders shaking with exaggerated grief.

Gregory's face darkened when he saw Evelyn. "You worthless disgrace! Get over here!" he roared. "On your knees! Apologize and accept your punishment!"

Evelyn remained composed. "I don't understand why I'm being punished."

"Don't play dumb!" Gregory's voice shook with anger. "Answer me! Did Cassandra take you on as her assistant when you needed work? Did she pay you well?"

Evelyn frowned slightly. "Technically, yes..."

"And how did you repay her kindness?" Gregory demanded.

"I worked diligently to justify my position," Evelyn answered honestly.

"Diligently?" Gregory scoffed. "Is that what you call it? She finally landed a role in Vincent Blackwood's new film! All she asked was for you to pour tea at the meeting, and you burned the investor's hand! What were you thinking?"

"I admit that happened," Evelyn conceded. "But it was accidental."

Gregory jabbed the broom toward her. "Do you think 'accident' fixes anything? Because of your carelessness, the film lost its funding! This was Vincent Blackwood's project - a guaranteed international breakthrough for any actor!"

"You've destroyed your sister's career!" he continued. "She was our family's only hope for success, and you ruined it!"

Victoria began fake-sobbing. "Evelyn... how could you? I know you're jealous of Cassandra's talent, but to sabotage her like this..."
###Chapter 143

Evelyn's tear-streaked face lifted as she spoke in a broken voice. "Victoria, I've been nothing but kind to you. I made you my assistant and even paid you a month's salary in advance. Name one other assistant who gets that kind of treatment!"

Her sobs grew louder, raw with betrayal. "Why would you destroy my career like this?"

Gabrielle rushed to her side, wrapping an arm around her shoulders. "Don't cry, Evelyn. Your father and I know how devastated you are. Victoria ruined everything because she envied you, but we're family. Can't you find it in your heart to forgive her? Maybe it wasn't intentional."

The words only fueled Gregory's rage. His glare burned into Victoria. "Look at this! Look how generously Gabrielle treats you, still begging Evelyn to forgive you! And what have you done in return?"

Victoria's lips curled into a bitter smile.

Gregory's grip tightened on the broom, trembling with the urge to strike. But something stopped him. With a frustrated growl, he threw it aside. "I won't hit you today. Pack your things and go back to the countryside. Never show your face here again! I'm giving Evelyn your dowry and inheritance as compensation!"

As he spoke, Victoria caught the triumphant glance exchanged between Gabrielle and Evelyn—cold, calculating smirks hidden behind false tears.

The truth was simple: Nathaniel Grayson and his associates would never have funded Vincent Blackwood's project, tea spill or not. Evelyn knew that. But she'd seized the opportunity to exile Victoria, stripping her of any claim to the family fortune.

From the beginning, Evelyn and Gabrielle's goal had been clear—cut Victoria out completely.

Victoria had never wanted their wealth. It meant nothing to her. But she refused to let them win.

Years of cruelty, the lies about her mother—Gabrielle had painted her as the other woman, twisting the truth into something ugly.

Victoria would never forgive them.

She met Gregory's gaze, voice steady. "Father, what if I can undo Evelyn's losses? Would you let me stay?"

Gregory blinked. "What did you say?"

Gabrielle scoffed, amusement dripping from her tone.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Empty words, Victoria. How exactly do you plan to fix this? Do you have millions to invest in Vincent Blackwood's film?"

Victoria shook her head. "No, I don't have that kind of money."

Evelyn sneered. "Then what's your brilliant solution? Mom, Dad, why are we even entertaining this nonsense?"

Gregory's frown deepened, impatience flashing in his eyes.

Victoria tilted her chin up. "I don't have the money. But I know someone who does."
###Chapter 144

Evelyn's calm declaration made Cassandra scoff. She crossed her arms, her lips curling in disbelief. "Oh really? Then tell us who this mystery investor is."

The name rolled off Evelyn's tongue effortlessly. "Seraphina Montgomery, president of Newmoon Group."

"Newmoon Group?" Cassandra's eyes widened, and she exchanged a startled glance with her mother, Victoria.

Gregory leaned forward, intrigued. "You mean the Newmoon Group that's risen to rival the top four conglomerates in just three years?"

Evelyn nodded. "That's the one."

Gregory rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "I've heard their president is quite young."

"Not just young," Evelyn added. "Brilliant, too."

Cassandra let out a derisive laugh. "Evelyn, stop spinning tales. How could someone like you possibly know the president of Newmoon? You're just trying to weasel your way out of this!"

Gregory's expression darkened with suspicion. "Evelyn, explain. How do you know Seraphina Montgomery?"

Evelyn shrugged. "I found her phone on the street and returned it. Apparently, it contained critical documents. She offered me a reward, but I declined. Instead, she gave me her card and told me to call if I ever needed help."

She reached into her pocket, but Victoria snatched the card before she could present it.

The card was undeniably luxurious—thick, with silver-edged lettering that gleamed under the light. Seraphina Montgomery's name and number were printed in elegant font.

Victoria's eyes narrowed skeptically. "This proves nothing. Call her right now, or we'll assume you're lying."

Cassandra smirked. "Yeah, for all we know, that number could be fake."

Gregory nodded in agreement. "Evelyn, make the call. Let's hear it for ourselves."

With a resigned sigh, Evelyn dialed the number on speakerphone.

"Hello, Miss Montgomery? This is Evelyn Whitmore."

The line connected. Gregory and Victoria leaned in, their gazes sharp as Evelyn inquired about potential movie investments.

Cassandra rolled her eyes, arms crossed. She was certain this was all an act—no way her stepsister could actually be speaking to a corporate titan.

Then, Evelyn held out the phone. "Cassandra, Miss Montgomery wants to speak with you. She has questions about the project."

Cassandra froze. But with a scoff, she took the phone, ready to expose the charade.

"Hello?"
###Chapter 145

The phone call connected with a soft click.

"Hello, Miss Cassandra."

A refined, melodic voice floated through the line—smooth, poised, dripping with quiet confidence. Every syllable carried the weight of someone accustomed to power.

Cassandra's fingers tightened around the phone. A nervous flutter rose in her chest. She forced her voice into something sweet, answering the questions about the film with practiced politeness.

After a moment, she nodded, a bright smile breaking across her face. "Of course, Miss Seraphina. I look forward to hearing from you."

The call ended.

Gregory and Victoria leaned in simultaneously. "Well? What did she say?"

Cassandra blinked, barely containing her excitement. "Daddy, Mommy—Miss Montgomery said she needs time to consider the investment. But!" She paused for dramatic effect. "Her company is launching a new product line, and she asked if I'd be interested in being their ambassador!"

Gregory's face lit up. "That's excellent news!"

Victoria beamed. "Newmoon Group's reputation is impeccable. If you secure this deal, your career will skyrocket."

Cassandra preened, pride swelling in her chest. "Miss Montgomery requested our address. She's sending a car to pick me up so we can discuss the details at her office."

Victoria clapped her hands. "Perfect! Go get ready—you don’t want to keep her waiting."

Cassandra turned to leave, but Evelyn blocked her path, holding out her phone. "Cassandra. My phone."

With a dramatic sigh, Cassandra snatched it back. "Fine. Send her the address now."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Does this mean I’ve made up for my mistake?"

Cassandra scoffed. "Hardly. She hasn’t agreed to invest yet. This is just an ambassador offer. You’re not forgiven until the deal is sealed."

She pushed past Evelyn and hurried upstairs to change.

Evelyn exhaled, turning to Gregory. "Daddy, should I start packing for the countryside?"

Gregory, still riding the high of the good news, waved a dismissive hand. "Stay. Consider this your reward for not completely ruining things."

A sly smile curled Evelyn’s lips. "How generous of you."

Gregory’s expression turned stern. "Go with your sister to Newmoon Group. Your presence might help secure better terms. And this time—don’t mess it up."

Evelyn dipped her head obediently. "I won’t."

Victoria stood beside Gregory, her smile tight. Beneath the pleasant facade, her thoughts burned. Damn it. We almost got rid of her. But at least she’s useful for now.

Twenty minutes later, the doorbell rang.

Cassandra, now flawlessly made up and dressed in an elegant designer outfit, perched on the sofa. She flicked a hand toward Evelyn. "Answer it."

Evelyn obeyed, pulling open the door—

Sebastian Monroe stood on the threshold, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit.
###Chapter 146

Sebastian's lips quirked into a half-smile as he murmured, "Hello, boss. It's been too long. I've missed you."

Before Evelyn could respond, Cassandra's voice cut through the air behind her. "Who's this?"

The playful glint in Sebastian's eyes vanished instantly, replaced by professional politeness. "Good afternoon. I'm Sebastian Monroe, Vice President of Newmoon Group."

Cassandra froze when she saw the striking man at the door. Her pulse quickened when she processed his impressive title.

With exaggerated enthusiasm, she shoved Evelyn aside and stepped forward. "Oh my! They sent the VP to pick me up? How extravagant!"

Sebastian offered a polite smile. "Only the best for the person who assisted Miss Montgomery and her sister."

Cassandra's smile faltered. She hadn't planned on Evelyn getting any credit, but the connection was undeniable. Grabbing Evelyn's arm in a show of false sisterly affection, she chirped, "My sister just happened to find Miss Montgomery's phone. Our family believes in returning what doesn't belong to us. Our parents raised us right - honesty above all!"

Gregory and Victoria emerged just in time to hear this declaration.

Sebastian's gaze flickered between them. "Clearly, your parents are remarkable people to have raised such principled daughters."

Gregory puffed up with pride but waved a modest hand. "You flatter us!"

"Please, come inside for tea," Victoria insisted, her eyes raking over the handsome executive with undisguised calculation. This was exactly the caliber of man she wanted for her daughter - powerful, wealthy, and devastatingly attractive.

"I'm afraid Miss Montgomery is expecting us at headquarters," Sebastian declined smoothly. "Miss Cassandra, Miss Evelyn, shall we go?"

"Absolutely!" Cassandra beamed, practically bouncing on her designer heels in her eagerness to leave.

Evelyn stifled a yawn and trailed after them.

The vintage Bentley waiting outside made Cassandra's eyes gleam. She'd ridden in countless luxury cars, but this rare classic was something else entirely. Her fingers itched to document the moment for social media.

With Sebastian watching, she settled for a discreet video - just a quick pan of the luxurious interior and the iconic hood ornament. Her caption read: [Another day of changing the world! #BossBabe #LivingTheDream]

Within seconds, notifications flooded in:

[IS THAT A 1950s BENTLEY?!]

[Who actually drives those? The maintenance costs must be insane!]

[Take me with you next time!]

Cassandra basked in the envy, her ego thoroughly stroked. Then she noticed Evelyn sprawled across the leather seat like she owned the place - eyes closed, completely at ease.

What Cassandra didn't know was that the Bentley actually did belong to Evelyn.
###Chapter 147

Even the chauffeur and Sebastian were on Evelyn's payroll.

Cassandra shot Evelyn a disdainful glance, rolling her eyes dramatically. If she hadn't accidentally picked up Seraphina's phone, she would never have dragged her provincial sister to Newmoon Group's headquarters. Just being in the same space with Evelyn made Cassandra feel her social status plummeting.

The sleek black sedan soon pulled up before Newmoon Group's towering glass skyscraper.

Sebastian exited first. Without hesitation, he moved to Evelyn's side and opened her door with practiced ease. "After you, Miss Whitmore."

Evelyn stepped out with effortless grace, as if this VIP treatment was her birthright. Cassandra's lips twisted in irritation.

'He only opened her door because it was closer,' Cassandra reassured herself. 'It's not special treatment.'

But her pride couldn't stomach being upstaged. Instead of exiting from her own side, she scooted across the leather seats toward Evelyn's vacated spot. Just as she reached for the handle, Sebastian slammed the door shut without warning.

Cassandra had no choice but to exit from her original side like some commoner.

Sebastian led them through the gleaming lobby. The elevator ride to the executive floor was silent except for Cassandra's nervous foot-tapping. When they reached the president's office, Sebastian knocked twice before announcing, "Miss Montgomery, Miss Cassandra and Miss Evelyn have arrived."

The office was a study in modern power. Behind an expansive mahogany desk sat Seraphina Montgomery, reviewing documents. Her chestnut hair cascaded over one shoulder in a sleek low ponytail. Gold-rimmed glasses perched on her aristocratic nose, reflecting the morning light.

Sebastian's duty fulfilled, he retreated to a plush sofa to observe the unfolding drama.

Seraphina looked up, her gaze immediately locking onto Evelyn. The lenses of her glasses flashed like twin mirrors.

Cassandra noticed the attention and deliberately stepped in front of Evelyn, flashing her most dazzling smile. "Miss Montgomery, what an honor. I'm Cassandra Whitmore."

Seraphina gave a perfunctory nod. "Miss Cassandra. On our call, you expressed interest in being the face of our new product line?"

"Absolutely," Cassandra gushed. "Collaborating with Newmoon Group would be a dream come true."

A faint smile touched Seraphina's lips. "Excellent. My assistant will show you our latest collection. As ambassador, you'll need thorough product knowledge."

"Of course!"

Cassandra's smile faltered. This wasn't the warm reception she'd expected. They'd barely arrived and were already being shuffled off? And why was Seraphina so much colder in person?

When the secretary appeared to escort her, Cassandra turned to find Evelyn still seated. "Evelyn! Aren't you coming?" she snapped.

Seraphina answered instead. "Miss Evelyn will remain. We have matters to discuss."

Cassandra blinked. "But...she's my assistant. I need her with me."

Seraphina's expression remained neutral, but her tone turned glacial. "My staff will attend to your every need."

Swallowing her frustration, Cassandra had no choice but to follow the secretary. 'What could Seraphina possibly want with that country mouse?' she fumed silently. 'Probably just thanking her again for returning that stupid phone.'

The moment the door clicked shut, Seraphina sprang from her chair. She rushed to Evelyn's side and began massaging her shoulders with practiced hands. "Boss! You finally decided to grace us with your presence!"
###Chapter 148

Evelyn's eyelids fluttered lazily as Seraphina worked on her tense shoulders. "A wolf's been circling my castle," she murmured. "Trouble follows me everywhere. I can't even breathe freely anymore."

Seraphina adjusted her gold-rimmed glasses with a knowing smirk. "This wolf wouldn't happen to be Nathaniel Grayson, would he?"

The image of Nathaniel's smirking face flashed in Evelyn's mind. She scowled. That damn man kept invading her thoughts lately. Though she hadn't shared recent events with Seraphina, she wasn't surprised her sharp-eyed friend had figured it out. Sebastian and his big mouth probably spilled everything.

Speaking of the devil, Sebastian bounded in with snacks, adjusting his pants before squatting to massage Evelyn's legs. His eyes sparkled with mischief. "So how's married life treating you? Getting any action?"

Evelyn nearly choked on her chips, cheeks flaming. "Go to hell!"

Sebastian's laughter echoed through the room as he continued kneading her calves, wisely dropping the subject.

Seraphina handed Evelyn a folder. "The quarterly financial report, boss. Take a look."

Evelyn scanned the document rapidly, nodding in approval. "Impressive. We've outperformed last quarter's numbers." She rattled off several strategic adjustments based on the data.

Sebastian listened intently before suddenly standing. "Seriously, boss, why waste time being Cassandra's assistant when you could be running the company? You're playing with fire for no good reason."

"The company's in good hands with you two." Evelyn's expression turned serious. "Any updates on that director I asked you to investigate?"

Sebastian nodded eagerly. "Vincent Blackwood - acclaimed director, Ant City native, art school graduate from some backwater town. Worked behind the scenes before hitting it big. Met his current wife Natasha while working on set. Her family's money bankrolled his first award-winning film."

He leaned closer, voice dropping. "Here's the juicy part - he had a two-year affair with your stepmother Victoria before fame. They split when she started seeing someone else."

Sebastian produced another file. "Recently, Victoria paid fifteen grand to falsify a paternity test at a private hospital. Changed the results from 'excluded' to 'confirmed biological father' for Vincent and Cassandra."

Evelyn's lips curled into a predatory smile. 'No wonder Vincent dotes on Cassandra despite her terrible acting. The proud man thinks she's his daughter. Classic Victoria - cheating on Daddy and passing off her ex's child as his.'

The pieces clicked into place perfectly.

Seraphina returned with fresh coffee. "Boss, we received a special design request. Client specifically asked for you."

Evelyn took a sip. "What project?"

"Grayson Group's new headquarters building design."

Evelyn nearly spat out her coffee at Nathaniel's name.

Seraphina continued, unfazed. "With the city's northward expansion, their current central location will become obsolete. They're planning a new flagship office at the future downtown core."
###Chapter 149

"Holden Group reached out to us first. Their president, Mister Nathaniel—the one you know—was impressed with our office building design. He specifically requested the architect behind this structure to design Holden Group's new headquarters. And we all know who that architect is, right? Stardust?"

Evelyn's brows knitted together. Stardust—the alias she used for professional projects.

Without hesitation, she shut it down. "No. Not happening."

Sebastian leaned forward, eyes gleaming. "Boss, they're offering a lot of money." He held up his fingers—one and five.

A hundred and fifty million dollars?! Evelyn nearly spat out her coffee. Nathaniel doesn’t hold back, does he?

Newmoon Group was still in its growth phase, barely three years old. While their market value soared, liquid cash remained tight.

A hundred and fifty million... That number was impossible to ignore.

Sebastian and Seraphina exchanged knowing glances. Their boss was tempted.

Sebastian pressed his advantage. "It's your call, of course. We haven't even discussed contract specifics yet."

After a long pause, Evelyn exhaled. "Fine. I'll take it."

Only a fool would turn down that kind of money.

Sebastian grinned. "Perfect. Mister Nathaniel is coming over later. You two can hash out the details face-to-face."

Evelyn, mid-sip, nearly choked again. She whipped her head toward him. "What? Who's coming?"

Sebastian smirked. "Your husband, Boss."

Seraphina elbowed him aside and clarified, "He requested a tour of our building today. Said he wanted to meet the architect—Stardust."

Evelyn's expression darkened. "He can tour the damn building all he wants. But I'm not meeting him."

Seraphina nodded. "Understood."

Sebastian, ever the meddler, tilted his head. "Why not? If he finds out his wife designed this place, he might actually start respecting you. Hell, he might even fall for you."

Evelyn shot him a withering glare. "We're done in three months. That goes for all of you too. No personal interactions with him. And never let him connect me—or any of you—to Newmoon Group."

Sebastian pouted. "That's harsh. What if you two actually—"

"No." Evelyn cut him off sharply.

She turned to Seraphina. "When is he arriving?"

Seraphina checked her watch. "Now, actually. He should be here any minute."

Right on cue, the secretary knocked. "Miss Seraphina, Mister Sebastian. Mister Nathaniel Grayson from Holden Group is here."
###Chapter 150 

Evelyn's heart raced as she leaped off the chair. "Sebastian, go distract him. I'll slip out when I get the chance."

"Don't let him see me here!"

"On it!" Sebastian's playful grin vanished instantly as he strode out to handle the situation.

Evelyn crept to the doorway, peering through the narrow gap to assess the danger.

Nathaniel stepped out of the elevator with Lucas following closely behind.

Sebastian greeted them with practiced professionalism. "Welcome, Mr. Grayson."

Nathaniel gave a curt nod. "Thank you."

With a smooth gesture, Sebastian turned sideways. "Ms. Montgomery mentioned your interest in our building's architecture. Would you like a tour of our interior designs?"

Nathaniel raised a dismissive hand. "Unnecessary. I've already surveyed several floors. I'm here to meet Ms. Montgomery and your lead architect, Stardust."

"My apologies, but Ms. Montgomery is currently in a meeting," Sebastian said smoothly. "It may take some time. Perhaps you'd enjoy our rooftop? The view overlooks the entire city."

"No need." Nathaniel's expression remained impassive. "I'll wait in the reception area."

Sebastian's attempts to redirect him proved futile. Pushing further would only raise suspicion.

Defeated, he glanced toward the office before gesturing politely. "This way, please."

Evelyn bit her lip as Sebastian led Nathaniel toward the reception room. She was trapped.

The glass-walled reception area sat between Seraphina's office and the only exits. Any movement would risk exposure.

Seraphina whispered urgently, "Hide in the private lounge. He seems pressed for time—he won't stay long."

"Only choice I've got." Evelyn grabbed two snack packs from Sebastian's gift and ducked into the concealed lounge.

Once hidden, Seraphina instructed her secretary to escort Nathaniel into her office.

"Mr. Grayson, please have a seat." Seraphina's smile never wavered as coffee was served.

After brief pleasantries, Nathaniel's gaze swept the room. "Ms. Montgomery, where might I find your principal architect?"

"Stardust isn't in today," Seraphina replied smoothly. "But I'd be happy to relay your specifications. We'll deliver preliminary drafts promptly."

Nathaniel lifted his cup, eyebrow arching. "For my investment, I expected direct collaboration with the architect."

"Of course," Seraphina adjusted her glasses. "But she's genuinely unavailable today."

"Is that so?" Nathaniel's eyes narrowed. "Your reception staff claimed she arrived this morning. Said it was a rare occurrence."

Seraphina's smile faltered for a split second. Damn the gossiping staff.

Though Evelyn founded Newmoon Group, employees only knew her as contracted architect Stardust. The receptionists must have spotted her arrival with Cassandra.

"Since you're aware," Seraphina conceded, "I can't deny it. Stardust is here, but occupied with urgent matters. I apologize."

Nathaniel's voice turned glacial. "Explain."
###Chapter 151

"Stardust has her reasons, and I'm not at liberty to disclose them," Seraphina stated firmly.

Nathaniel let out a cold chuckle. "Seems Newmoon Group isn't serious about partnering with Grayson Enterprises on this project. No matter."

He set down his coffee cup with deliberate force and rose from his seat.

Inside the lounge, Evelyn heard every word. Nathaniel's displeasure was palpable, and she knew his patience had limits.

If he walked out now, they'd lose the $150 million deal.

Panicking, Evelyn spotted a pile of equipment in the corner - Sebastian's purchases. Among them, something resembling a gas mask caught her eye.

"Mister Grayson, please wait!"

Nathaniel paused at the office door, turning slowly. His striking eyes narrowed when they landed on the figure emerging from the lounge.

Seraphina turned and gasped. "Why is our CEO dressed like—"

Evelyn had changed into Seraphina's clothes and now wore the gas mask. She approached Nathaniel, pitching her voice higher. "You wanted to meet me, didn't you? I'm Stardust."

Nathaniel's brow furrowed as he studied her.

Lucas gaped. 'Is Stardust implying Mister Grayson is toxic?'

"My apologies," Evelyn explained quickly. "I'm suffering severe skin allergies - my face is covered in rashes. This mask prevents me from offending your eyes. That's why Miss Montgomery said I couldn't meet clients. I hope this doesn't interfere with our discussion."

Nathaniel gave a curt nod. "Your fashion choices don't concern me."

Evelyn bowed slightly. "Thank you for understanding, Mister Grayson."

Seraphina stepped forward smoothly. "Now that Stardust has joined us, perhaps you'd reconsider staying? Clearly there's been a misunderstanding. Let us demonstrate our sincerity."

Nathaniel resumed his seat, with Evelyn positioned between him and Seraphina.

He cut straight to business. "Miss Stardust, I'm curious about your inspiration for the Celestial Tower."

The tower appeared crescent-shaped due to its innovative glass facade, though structurally circular. Its unique design left lasting impressions on all who saw it.

"The moon inspires me," Evelyn explained. "The new moon represents beginnings, the future - much like your company's vision."

As she spoke passionately, Nathaniel studied her with growing interest. When she finished, he tilted his head. "Have we met before, Miss Stardust?"

Evelyn's pulse jumped. "Certainly not. I'd remember meeting someone as distinguished as yourself."

Nathaniel's intense gaze through the mask made her nervous. She quickly changed subjects. "What are your thoughts on the new headquarters' design?"

"I won't constrain your creativity," he said, "but keep it practical."

Evelyn nodded. "Thank you for your trust. I look forward to a successful partnership."

As Nathaniel checked his watch and stood to leave, Evelyn exhaled in relief.

Seraphina moved to escort him out, but upon opening the door, found Cassandra mid-knock.

Cassandra's face lit up. "Mister Grayson! What a surprise!"

Nathaniel's first instinct was to scan for Evelyn behind her. Finding no trace, his voice turned icy. "Why are you here?"

"Newmoon Group asked me to endorse their new product," Cassandra explained sweetly. "Miss Montgomery was briefing my assistant, so I came to collect her."

Nathaniel's eyes sharpened. 'Evelyn's here?'
###Chapter 152

Cassandra's bright smile faltered when Nathaniel showed no reaction to her animated explanation. His face remained cold and unreadable, radiating an intimidating aura.

Choosing not to push further, Cassandra turned to Seraphina to mask her discomfort. "Where's my assistant, Miss Montgomery? I need her to carry my things!"

Seraphina adjusted her gold-rimmed glasses, sensing trouble brewing. "Your assistant just left, Miss Cassandra."

Cassandra's frown deepened. "Left? Where would she go without my permission? The audacity!"

"I wouldn't know," Seraphina replied smoothly.

Already irritated that Evelyn had been summoned for a private meeting, Cassandra's temper flared at her assistant's unexplained absence. She immediately dialed Evelyn's number.

Seraphina moved to intervene, but it was too late.

The distinct ringtone of "Brave" by Sara Bareilles echoed from inside the office. Cassandra's eyes narrowed. "That's my assistant's phone. She's still in there, isn't she?"

Seraphina's professional mask slipped for just a second before she recovered. "Your assistant departed, but apparently forgot her phone."

Nathaniel's expression darkened as he recalled the architect Stardust - those familiar eyes behind the gas mask couldn't be coincidence. His jaw tightened with sudden realization.

He turned sharply toward the office door.

Seraphina blocked his path, tilting her head up to meet his gaze. "Is there something you need, Mr. Grayson?"

"I've reconsidered the Silver Peaks Estate design. I need to speak with Stardust immediately."

Seraphina adjusted her glasses again. "You may share your thoughts with me. I'll relay them precisely."

Nathaniel's eyes turned glacial. "Why play messenger when the architect is right there? What exactly are you hiding?"

A flicker of tension crossed Seraphina's face before she smiled. "You misunderstand. Stardust suffers severe allergies and requires rest. As her employer, I must ensure she's not overworked."

Nathaniel's stance remained unyielding. "This won't take long. Step aside."

Their standoff was interrupted by Evelyn's clear voice from down the hall. "Here I am, Cassandra!"

Both turned to see Evelyn strolling casually from the left corridor, stifling a yawn. Sebastian Monroe, Newmoon Group's vice president, walked beside her.
###Chapter 153

Sebastian was strikingly handsome, while Evelyn possessed an ethereal beauty. Together, they formed a mesmerizing pair.

A shadow of resentment flickered in Cassandra's eyes as she watched Evelyn walk beside Sebastian, the vice president of Newmoon Group. Forced to maintain civility in front of important figures, she still managed to lace her words with subtle venom. "Where did you disappear to, Evelyn?"

Evelyn approached with practiced innocence. "I was searching for the restroom but got lost. Mister Sebastian kindly offered to show me the way."

Cassandra's jaw tightened as she glared at Evelyn before forcing a polite smile toward Sebastian. "My apologies for my assistant's incompetence troubling you."

Sebastian's lips curved into an easy smile. "No trouble at all. I was heading that direction myself."

The forced smile on Cassandra's face couldn't mask her irritation at Evelyn's chance encounter with such an influential man.

Evelyn tilted her head curiously. "Have you finished reviewing the new product already, Cassandra?"

Cassandra ignored the question, inwardly seething at her assistant's audacity. Turning to Seraphina with a practiced smile, she asked, "Miss Montgomery, when can we proceed with signing the contract?"

Seraphina had regained her professional composure. "Your agency will need to handle the formalities. Individual celebrities can't sign endorsement contracts directly."

"Of course!" Cassandra beamed. "My manager will come this afternoon to discuss details."

Seraphina gave a curt nod. "Ask for Mister Daniel when you arrive."

"Thank you!" Cassandra couldn't hide her triumph. "About my upcoming film project..."

Seraphina's mouth twitched. "We'll consider investment based on your performance as brand ambassador."

"You won't be disappointed!" Cassandra vowed with theatrical confidence. "I'll take my leave now and return with my manager this afternoon."

Receiving only a dismissive hum from Seraphina, Cassandra turned to Evelyn with undisguised contempt. "Let's go!"

Evelyn hesitated. "Wait, I left my phone inside."

"Then hurry up!" Cassandra's sweet tone barely concealed her impatience. Had they been alone, she would have unleashed a torrent of abuse.

Evelyn walked past Nathaniel without sparing him a glance. She pushed open the president's office door and strode inside confidently.

Retrieving her phone from the lounge sofa, she noticed 'Stardust' sitting nearby wearing a gas mask, typing furiously on a laptop as if documenting something important.

Outside the door, Nathaniel's imposing frame stood motionless. His cold gaze swept across the office, lingering on the simultaneous presence of 'Stardust' and Evelyn. The tension in his brow gradually eased.

Seraphina turned to Nathaniel with a knowing smile. "It seems Stardust is still working. Feel free to speak with her if you wish, Mister Grayson."

Nathaniel's response was ice. "That won't be necessary." Without another word, he turned sharply and left with Lucas.

Seeing Nathaniel depart, Cassandra hastily bid farewell to Seraphina and Sebastian before dragging Evelyn toward the elevators, desperate to share a ride with the powerful businessman.

As the elevator doors closed behind them, Seraphina's composed expression fractured into concern. "What happened? How did Evelyn get away?"
###Chapter 154

Sebastian sighed, shaking his head. "She climbed out through the office window and came in from the restroom. Simple as that."

Seraphina's frown deepened. "But we're on the thirtieth floor."

He shrugged. "My rock-climbing gear was in the lounge. Handy coincidence. For someone with her skills, it's nothing."

Seraphina removed her gold-rimmed glasses, rubbing her temples. "And who's in the office right now?"

"Your secretary. The boss told her to wear the mask, change into her clothes, and pretend to be busy."

"...Brilliant."

Sebastian narrowed his eyes, thoughtful. "Why do you think she’s so determined to keep Nathaniel from finding out she’s Stardust?"

Seraphina shot him a warning look. "She has her reasons. It’s not our ce to speculate."

He stroked his chin. "I don’t buy that Nathaniel isn’t even slightly interested. I’m going to test him."

Disgust flashed across her face. "Test him? Don’t stir trouble and piss her off!"

"Relax. You’ll hear good news soon." With a smirk, he waved and dashed toward the elevator.

Inside the descending elevator, Nathaniel’s deep voice cut through the silence. "Have you eaten yet?" The rich timbre of his words filled the confined space, enough to make anyone’s pulse skip.

Beside him, Cassandra flushed, fingers twisting nervously. "Not yet. Have you?"

His expression remained unreadable, distant. The elevator held only his secretary and Evelyn, Cassandra’s assistant. She assumed the question was for her.

When he didn’t respond immediately, the silence grew awkward. Cassandra cleared her throat. "If you haven’t, let me treat you to lunch. Consider it an apology for my assistant burning you last night."

Again, no answer. His gaze slid to Evelyn, who stood in the corner, scrolling through her phone with utter indifference.

Nathaniel’s eyes darkened. After a beat, he said, "Fine."

Cassandra nearly vibrated with excitement. He agreed! This was a sign—he had to like her. Why else would he say yes?

Then Evelyn glanced up, tone flat. "Can I take the rest of the day off? I’m exhausted."

Cassandra barely hid her relief. Perfect. "Of course. Go rest."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Thanks."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. She’s avoiding me.

"Wasn’t Miss Evelyn the one who burned me?" His voice turned icy. "Shouldn’t the offender be present for the apology?"

Cassandra froze. "She’s not feeling well—"

His laugh was sharp. "Then there’s no sincerity here. Forget lunch."

Panicked, she grabbed Evelyn’s arm. "Evelyn. You’re coming. Apologize properly, then you can leave."

Evelyn exhaled through her nose. "...Fine."
###Chapter 155

Nathaniel's piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn, a faint smirk playing at the corners of his lips.

The elevator doors slid open. Nathaniel strode out, hands tucked casually into his pockets. Lucas followed a step behind.

Cassandra yanked Evelyn forward, hurrying after them. She couldn't risk Nathaniel forgetting their lunch plans.

"Miss Whitmore! Wait!" A voice called out suddenly. Cassandra halted and turned to see Sebastian Monroe—Newmoon Group's vice president—rushing from the opposite elevator, smiling at her.

Confidence oozing, Cassandra flashed a practiced smile. "Mister Sebastian! What brings you all the way down here? Is this about the ambassadorship? Need to clarify anything else?"

Sebastian barely glanced at her before his attention shifted past her to Evelyn. "I'm not here for you. I was looking for that Miss Whitmore."

Cassandra's smile stiffened. She forced a laugh. "Oh—Evelyn! Why are you just standing there? Mister Sebastian wants to speak with you!" Her voice dripped with false sweetness as she turned, eyes darkening.

Evelyn approached warily, brows knitted. "What is it, Mister Sebastian?"

Sebastian stepped closer, a suggestive grin spreading. "There were too many people upstairs earlier, so I didn’t get the chance to ask properly… Do you have a boyfriend?"

Evelyn’s frown deepened. What the hell is this guy’s deal?

Before she could answer, Sebastian pressed on eagerly. "If not, would you give me a chance? I’d love to get to know you better."

Evelyn stared at him like he’d lost his mind. Did he hit his head or something?

Sebastian wasn’t done. "Honestly, I fell for you the moment I saw you. Just one date—that’s all I’m asking."

Beside them, Cassandra stood frozen, teeth clenched so hard her jaw ached.

Unbelievable! Why does everything always revolve around Evelyn? How the hell does a nobody assistant catch a vice president’s eye?!

Evelyn forced a tight smile. "Let’s discuss this another time, Mister Sebastian." She brushed past him without another word.

Sebastian smirked, trailing after her just far enough to ensure Nathaniel’s icy glare burned into his back.

Once they were out of earshot, Evelyn spun around. "What’s going on, Sebastian?"

Instead of answering, he raised his voice deliberately. "Thanks for giving me a shot! Here’s my card—my personal number’s on it. I’ll be waiting for your call!" He shoved the card into her hand, then—before she could react—pulled her into a quick, exaggerated hug before darting back into the elevator.

Evelyn stood stunned. Is he having some kind of breakdown?

She turned, only to lock eyes with Nathaniel. His expression was unreadable, but the cold intensity in his gaze sent a shiver down her spine.

Cassandra, meanwhile, seethed silently. But she quickly plastered on a smile, sidling up to Nathaniel. "So, Mister Grayson… where should we go for lunch?"
###Chapter 156

"Whatever you prefer." Nathaniel's icy tone made it clear he had no interest in lunch, though he didn't outright decline.

Cassandra didn't mind his cold demeanor. She was too thrilled at the prospect of dining with someone of Nathaniel's stature.

"How about The Celestial Bloom? Their cuisine is exceptional!"

The Celestial Bloom was one of the most exclusive restaurants in the city, with prices to match. Cassandra would never consider dining there unless she was entertaining a VIP like Nathaniel.

Nathaniel gave a curt nod and turned toward the lobby entrance without another word.

As she followed him, Cassandra spun around and snapped at Evelyn, "Hurry up! Do you really expect Mister Grayson to wait for you?"

Evelyn suppressed a sigh and quickened her pace. Since Sebastian had driven them here and she hadn't brought her own car, it made sense for them to ride together.

Cassandra was practically giddy at the thought of sitting in Nathaniel's luxury car. When his assistant, Lucas, opened the rear door of the sleek Mercedes, Nathaniel didn't enter immediately. Instead, he stepped aside as if waiting for someone else to go first.

Cassandra's heart skipped a beat. She couldn't help but read into the gesture. Gliding forward with practiced grace, she murmured, "Aren't you getting in?"

Nathaniel glanced at her, his expression unreadable. "After you."

Her pulse raced, and a wave of exhilaration washed over her. She hadn't misread his intentions—he was waiting for her. A man like Nathaniel didn't extend such courtesies to just anyone. The fact that he did so for her could only mean one thing: he was interested.

"Thank you, Mister Grayson." She flashed him a demure smile and slid into the car, already imagining him sitting beside her.

But Nathaniel didn't join her. Instead, his gaze shifted to Evelyn, who stood off to the side. When she didn't move, his voice dropped to a warning tone. "Get in."

It sounded more like an order than an invitation.

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "Fine."

Once she was inside, Nathaniel finally entered the car. Cassandra's excitement deflated instantly. Her hopes of sitting next to him evaporated, replaced by simmering irritation. She shot Evelyn a glare, resentment coiling tight in her chest.
###Chapter 157

Evelyn found herself sandwiched between them. Biting back her fury, Cassandra resorted to discreetly pinching the tender skin just above Evelyn's hip, twisting it sharply to vent her frustration.

The sudden attack caught Evelyn completely off guard. A sharp hiss escaped her lips as she instinctively recoiled from the pain, only to collide with Nathaniel's solid chest.

His arm immediately encircled her shoulders. "What happened?" His deep voice rumbled close to her ear.

Realization dawned on Evelyn. She tried to pull away like he carried the plague, but his grip remained firm. 'What the hell is he doing? We agreed to act like strangers in front of Cassandra!'

Seeing Evelyn pressed against Nathaniel only fueled Cassandra's rage. "Evelyn!" she snapped through gritted teeth. "Stop hogging Mister Grayson's space! Move back here!"

Evelyn shot a glare at the hypocritical instigator before looking up at Nathaniel. "My apologies, Mister Grayson. Something startled me—I didn't mean to..." She emphasized her words with a meaningful blink, silently reminding him of their agreement.

After a tense two-second pause, Nathaniel finally released her. Evelyn scooted back immediately, rubbing the sore spot on her waist. His sharp eyes tracked every movement, narrowing slightly.

Once Evelyn settled back into position, Cassandra didn't dare try anything else—the last thing she wanted was giving Evelyn another excuse to throw herself at Nathaniel.

'You shameless little tramp,' Cassandra seethed internally. 'Always finding ways to cling to men!'

The Wild Bites restaurant, Cassandra's chosen venue, sat in the heart of downtown. Within ten minutes, they were seated at their table.

Cassandra rose gracefully. "Please order for us, Mister Grayson. I'll be right back after freshening up." Nathaniel barely acknowledged her with a curt nod.

Turning to Evelyn, Cassandra forced a smile. "Keep me company, Evelyn." This was purely to prevent Evelyn from making moves on Nathaniel in her absence.

Evelyn followed without protest.

In the restroom, Cassandra touched up her makeup while shooting Evelyn disdainful looks through the mirror. "Don't get any ideas," she sneered. "Just because Sebastian Monroe was blind enough to fall for a country bumpkin like you doesn't mean Mister Grayson would."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Trust me, that thought never crossed my mind."

Cassandra snapped her compact shut with a sharp click. "You'd better watch your behavior," she warned, applying lipstick with aggressive precision. "Haven't you noticed how irritated Mister Grayson looks whenever he sees you? Probably still furious about that scalding incident yesterday!"

"That's why I took today off," Evelyn countered. "But you insisted I come along."

Cassandra's eyes flashed with anger. "I brought you to apologize, not to keep throwing yourself at him! Stay here and pretend you have stomach issues. Only come out when I call you. The last thing I need is you ruining Mister Grayson's appetite!"

Evelyn made an exaggerated 'OK' gesture. "Absolutely! No problem at all!" She couldn't hide her relief—she'd much rather be anywhere but near Nathaniel right now. If not for Cassandra's insistence, she'd be comfortably napping at home.

After finishing her touch-ups, Cassandra snatched her designer bag from Evelyn and stuffed her makeup inside. "Remember—stay put," she threatened before flouncing out.

Evelyn nodded obediently. "Understood."

The moment Cassandra left, Evelyn exited the restroom too. While she had zero interest in interrupting Nathaniel and Cassandra's lunch date, she wasn't about to spend the next hour inhaling bathroom odors either.

She found a quiet stairwell to call Sebastian. "What's this about a 'confession'?" she demanded as soon as he answered.

"Miss me already?" His teasing voice made her lip twitch.

"Miss you? As if—" Her retort was cut short by a familiar deep voice.

"Who are you talking to?"

Nathaniel's sudden appearance made Evelyn jump.
###Chapter 158

Evelyn blinked back to awareness, spinning around to find Nathaniel looming behind her with stormy eyes.

A shiver raced down her spine. Her fingers moved on instinct, cutting Sebastian's call short. "Just a friend!" she snapped, shoving the phone into her pocket.

Nathaniel extended his palm like a stern teacher demanding contraband. "Hand it over."

Her brows knitted in irritation. This was ridiculous overreaction, but arguing here seemed pointless. After a beat, she reluctantly surrendered the device.

The screen lit up under his touch, then darkened with the lock symbol. "Password." His voice dropped ten degrees.

"That's private." Evelyn crossed her arms. "I don't have to tell you."

Nathaniel's gaze sharpened. "Why so defensive?"

"I'm not!"

He dangled the phone just out of reach, his tone turning dangerous. "Then prove it."

Evelyn nearly growled. The audacity! Who did he think he was—some tyrannical emperor demanding access to her personal life?

"Not happening," she ground out, meeting his glare head-on.

A muscle jumped in his jaw. Few dared defy him, least of all women. This infuriating girl treated his authority like a mild inconvenience. Her occasional compliance was merely strategic laziness—a way to sidestep drama.

Most times, those clear eyes held zero deference, fear, or even basic concern for his position.

Yet this sudden resistance? Suspicious. What secrets was she guarding so fiercely? Who warranted such covert calls?

"Last chance, Evelyn." He gripped her chin, forcing her gaze upward. "The password."

Her lips curled into a mocking smile. "Guess right, and I'll tell you."

Veins stood out on his forehead. God help him, the temptation to throttle her grew by the second.

The phone chose that moment to ring—Sebastian calling back.

Evelyn lunged, but Nathaniel raised it high above her grasping fingers.

"Give it back!" she demanded, jumping uselessly as he towered over her. The screen flashed Sebastian's name like an accusation between them.
###Chapter 159

Nathaniel's icy gaze locked onto Evelyn. Holding her phone high above her head, his long fingers swiped across the screen, accepting the call before switching it to speaker mode.

Sebastian's gentle voice came through the line. "Why did you hang up so suddenly when you called earlier?"

Evelyn's throat tightened.

Nathaniel studied her guilty expression. "Is this the 'friend' you mentioned?"

She pressed her lips together. 'We're partners and he reports to me, but explaining that would only complicate things!'

Thankfully, she'd memorized Sebastian's number instead of saving it - just like Seraphina's. As long as Sebastian didn't reveal their professional connection, Nathaniel would never know about their longstanding partnership. "Evelyn? Are you there? Where are you? Should I come find you?" Sebastian's earnest voice filled the tense silence.

Nathaniel's striking eyes narrowed. He slowly lowered the phone to eye level. "She's married." His clipped tone carried the weight of a thunderclap, laced with unmistakable possession.

"What? Who is this?" Sebastian's shocked voice crackled through the speaker.

Nathaniel's reply came in three frigid words. "Her husband."

A beat of silence. Then Sebastian's wounded voice returned. "No! That's impossible! I don't believe it! Let me hear Evelyn say it-"

Nathaniel ended the call with a sharp tap before the protest could continue.

He thrust the phone back at Evelyn, his smirk razor-sharp. "Impatient, aren't we? Couldn't wait to call him back?"

Evelyn's jaw twitched. "It's not what you think! What Mr. Monroe said at Newmoon Group was bizarre - I needed to clarify if there was some misunderstanding-"

Nathaniel's lips curled in a sneer. "He declared his love at first sight publicly. What's there to misunderstand? Did you really need confirmation? Or were you hoping to take things further with him? Maybe start dating properly?"

Evelyn's chest constricted. "That's not- I wouldn't-"

Nathaniel's large hand gripped her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. "How many times must I remind you? You're my wife now. No private interactions with other men."

The pressure on her jaw made her wince. She struggled against his iron grip. "You're paranoid! We're not even a real couple! Checking my phone, answering my calls - you've crossed every boundary! Even real marriages wouldn't survive this level of distrust!"

Silence.

"You're hurting me," she gasped.

Nathaniel's pupils dilated. He released her abruptly.

Rubbing her sore jaw, Evelyn knew pushing further would backfire. Two months remained in their arrangement - two months of unavoidable daily contact. Worse, Cassandra waited for their return to lunch. Any prolonged absence would raise questions.

"Fine. I was wrong. I'm sorry." She dropped her gaze, resentment simmering beneath the apology.

Nathaniel blinked. Her subdued posture extinguished half his anger. "Explain how exactly you were wrong."

Her lips twisted. "Wrong to call him now. Should've waited three months when I'm no longer Mrs. Grayson and you lose all say over my life."

The momentary softening in Nathaniel's expression vanished, replaced by stormy darkness.
###Chapter 160

Evelyn's voice trembled with frustration. "You've never trusted me, not even once! You had Lucas arrange that job just to keep me under your thumb. That way, you could monitor my every move and make sure I wasn't cheating on you, right?"

Nathaniel's dark gaze bore into her, his expression unreadable. For a long moment, he said nothing.

"I'm just a temporary guest in your grand life, Mister Grayson. A fleeting presence for three months. Stop trying to control me! If you don't believe me, I'll swear it right now!"

Without hesitation, Evelyn raised her hand, her voice firm. "I, Evelyn Whitmore, swear before God that I will never betray Nathaniel Grayson. If I break this vow, may lightning strike me dead where I stand!"

The moment the words left her lips, she dropped her hand and turned toward the door.

Her fingers barely grazed the doorknob before Nathaniel's palm slammed the door shut behind her.

"Did I say you could leave?"

Evelyn clenched her jaw. What more does he want? I already swore!

She spun around, glaring. "Aren't we done here? Stop acting like a possessive child!"

Nathaniel's eyes darkened at her words. He leaned in, his breath warm against her ear, his voice dangerously soft. "Me? Possessive? You think I'd waste jealousy on you? You're nothing but a naive little girl."

"And you're a grown man throwing a tantrum!" The retort burst out before she could stop it. Instantly, she regretted it.

Too late now.

She yanked at the door again, but his hand held it firmly in place.

His lips brushed her ear, sending a shiver down her spine. "What was that?"

"Nothing!" She twisted, desperate to escape, but his grip on her shoulders forced her to face him.

Her cheeks burned with embarrassment, her lashes fluttering as she refused to meet his gaze.

Nathaniel studied her—the way her breath hitched, the flush staining her cheeks, the defiance in her eyes.

She was infuriating.

And undeniably captivating.

She had counted the days—two months and seven days left. She remembered exactly.

Since when did she start affecting me like this?

The thought of other men looking at her, wanting her—it unsettled him.

She accused him of controlling her, but if he truly wanted to, he wouldn’t need to lock her up. He could track her every move with a single command.

He’d given her that job because he knew she hated idleness. Better she worked under him than suffer under someone else’s whims.

This damn woman twists everything I do.
###Chapter 161

Nathaniel's expression darkened as he calculated the remaining time—two months and seven days until he'd lose all rights to control her. The thought of Evelyn being with other men, touching them, kissing them—it made his blood boil.

"Absolutely not," he growled under his breath.

Evelyn struggled against the door, trapped between the solid wood and Nathaniel's imposing frame. His silence stretched unbearably long. "If you've got something to say," she snapped, "say it and let me go! Otherwise I'm—mmph!"

His mouth crashed down on hers without warning, tongue forcing past her lips in a possessive invasion.

Her mind short-circuited. Wide-eyed, she stared at his sculpted features mere inches away—those dark lashes, the faint scar above his eyebrow—all while his mouth worked hers with ruthless expertise.

Reality returned with a jolt. She shoved against his chest, but he only deepened the kiss, one hand gripping her waist while the other cradled her head. His skill was infuriating—slow, deliberate strokes that made her knees weaken despite herself. Her fingers twisted in his lapels as she gave a hesitant response.

When they finally broke apart, both were breathing heavily. Nathaniel smirked at her dazed expression, ruffling her hair like she was some misbehaving kitten. "No calling other men," he ordered, voice rough.

Evelyn wiped her mouth furiously, cheeks burning. "You didn't need to assault me to make your point!"

His thumb brushed her swollen lips. "That rule stands even after three months."

Her pulse stuttered. "Why?"

"Because—"

A sharp voice cut through the stairwell. "You can't go in there, Miss Cassandra!"

Cassandra's shrill retort followed. "Is Nathaniel in there? Lunch is getting cold! What could possibly be more important than—"

"Miss Cassandra, please—"

"I demand to see him!"

Evelyn's stomach dropped. She needed to escape—now. But Nathaniel's grip tightened around her wrist. "Running won't help," he murmured.

"You promised to keep this from my sister!" she hissed.

The door burst open before he could respond.
###Chapter 162

Evelyn couldn't pry Nathaniel's large hand off her, so she quickly raised her other hand and slammed the door shut.

Lucas was using his body to block the stairwell entrance, but Cassandra turned aggressive, trying to force it open through the small gap.

The more she was denied entry, the more suspicious she became. She needed to see what Nathaniel was doing inside - whether he was alone or with someone.

Lucas had enough of Cassandra's antics. "Miss Cassandra," he warned angrily, "if you keep forcing your way in, I won't be held responsible for what happens next!"

Cassandra scoffed at his threat. In her eyes, Nathaniel's assistant was beneath her, just like her own staff. "How dare a mere secretary threaten me? Once I become Mrs. Grayson, my first order will be firing you!"

"Go ahead and try! Lay one finger on me and I'll scream assault!"

"You—" Lucas was speechless against such shamelessness. Reasoning with this woman was pointless.

Seeing her tactic worked, Cassandra deliberately pressed her body against Lucas, pushing her chest forward to make him retreat.

Lucas recoiled uncomfortably, unable to avoid her advances. He couldn't bring himself to strike a woman, even one like her.

Seizing her chance, Cassandra shoved past him into the stairwell.

What she saw stunned her.

Nathaniel's tall frame leaned casually against the wall, his expression bored yet weary. A freshly lit cigarette dangled between his elegant fingers as he took a slow drag, exhaling a thin stream of smoke.

Cassandra was mesmerized by his handsome profile, the mature way he smoked. After a long moment, she managed to speak. "Why are you here alone? Won't you come back for lunch?"

Nathaniel arched an eyebrow. "Nicotine craving."

She smiled coyly. "I see... Well, come eat when you're done. The food will get cold."

He flicked ash indifferently. "Go ahead without me."

Even this simple motion was unbearably attractive. Cassandra suppressed her lustful thoughts, adopting a gentle tone. "I'll wait for you. I couldn't possibly eat first!"

"I don't care if you do," he said coldly.

Misinterpreting his concern, she blushed. "I'm not hungry yet! I can wait!"

A flash of irritation crossed Nathaniel's eyes. He stubbed out the half-smoked cigarette and straightened. "Let's go then."

Cassandra's heart raced. 'He's putting out his cigarette for me!'

So consumed by this fantasy, she failed to notice the fresh handprint on Nathaniel's left cheek.

As they exited, Lucas closed the stairwell door.

Below them, Evelyn sat on the steps, her stinging palm pressed between her knees.
###Chapter 163

Evelyn's heart pounded as she delivered a sharp slap to the man's face, desperate to break free. The moment she heard the others had left, relief flooded through her.

Then her phone buzzed again—another call from Sebastian.

She gritted her teeth and answered.

Sebastian's voice dripped with exaggerated drama, as if he were auditioning for a soap opera. "Miss Evelyn! Tell me it isn’t true! Some guy just said you're married, but I refuse to believe him! You wouldn’t—"

"Cut the act!" Evelyn snapped. "It's me."

A brief silence followed before Sebastian dropped the theatrics, chuckling. "So, boss. How’d it go?"

"How did what go?"

"Did Nathaniel get jealous? Did you two finally—"

Evelyn’s patience snapped. "Stop. This isn’t a game. I told you—this arrangement lasts three months, nothing more."

Even as she said it, her stomach twisted. She couldn’t shake the memory of Nathaniel’s lips on hers—unexpected, uninvited.

This wasn’t their first kiss.

The first time, she’d grabbed him in front of a sleazy suitor her stepmother had forced on her. A calculated move.

The second time, in Starlight Lounge, she’d lost a stupid bet and had to kiss someone she knew. Nathaniel had stepped in, refusing to let her kiss anyone else—for appearances, he’d claimed.

But this time? No excuse. No audience. Just him, acting on impulse.

He’d made it clear—anything but feelings. So what did that make her? A toy?

Disgusted, she wiped her mouth.

Sebastian, oblivious, kept talking. "Honestly, Nathaniel’s not bad. Older, sure, but loaded, influential, and scandal-free. Why not make this marriage real?"

"Because he’s in love with someone else," Evelyn hissed. "And I’m not interested in being his consolation prize."

Sebastian gasped dramatically. "Damn. So he’s a player?"

"I don’t care what he is," Evelyn said coldly. "Two months and seven days. Then we’re done." She exhaled sharply. "Actually, you called at the perfect time. I need a favor."

Sebastian switched to business mode instantly. "Name it."

Evelyn laid out her plan.

"Consider it done," he said before hanging up.

No sooner had the call ended than her phone rang again—Cassandra.

Evelyn braced herself before answering.

"What the hell, Evelyn?!" Cassandra shrieked. "Why is your phone off during work hours?!"

Evelyn massaged her temples. "I was on another call. What do you need?"

"Who said you could take personal calls on company time?!" Cassandra snarled. "Get your ass to my office. Now."
###Chapter 164

Evelyn had no clue what triggered Cassandra's outburst, but she responded briefly before hanging up and returning to their table.

The upscale restaurant was sparsely populated. Cassandra had booked a prime spot by the floor-to-ceiling windows with a stunning river view - the most expensive seating with the lowest spending requirement.

She'd gritted her teeth while making the reservation, determined to impress Nathaniel and maintain her wealthy facade. Normally, she'd never splurge like this. The thought of wasting all that money on an untouched meal made her blood boil.

Approaching from across the dining room, Evelyn saw Cassandra fuming by the window. Arms crossed, shoulders tense - pure fury radiated from her solitary figure. Nathaniel was conspicuously absent.

Evelyn had anticipated this. Cassandra would never use that tone with her in Nathaniel's presence.

"Why did you call me back, Cassandra?"

Cassandra whirled around, eyes blazing. "Was this your plan all along, Evelyn?"

Evelyn blinked. "Plan?"

"Ignoring me on purpose!" Cassandra's jaw clenched. "Nathaniel thought you weren't sincere about apologizing since you weren't at the table. He left without touching his food!"

Evelyn sighed. "Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't you tell me to fake stomach problems because you wanted me gone?"

Cassandra's face froze momentarily before her anger redoubled. She jabbed a finger at Evelyn. "When Nathaniel got upset, I called you immediately! He only left because you didn't answer! If you'd just come back to apologize, he'd still be here! This is entirely your fault, Evelyn! You're nothing but bad luck!"

Evelyn's lips twitched in disbelief. 'She's blaming me because she couldn't keep him interested?'

Already furious about wasting money at The Wild Bites, Cassandra's temper flared higher seeing Evelyn's indifferent expression. "I don't care how you do it - get Nathaniel back here today or you're paying for this meal!"

Evelyn spread her hands. "I don't have that kind of money."

Cassandra's disgusted glare intensified, yet Evelyn's poverty secretly pleased her. "No money? Then return the advance I gave you!"

Though she knew Evelyn was penniless, Cassandra needed to recoup her losses somehow.

Evelyn shook her head firmly. "You can't dock my pay when I did nothing wrong."

"Nothing wrong?" Cassandra shrieked. "You burned Nathaniel and made him leave! If you're so innocent, should we call Father and ask his opinion?"

Evelyn lowered her head, a cunning glint hidden beneath feigned fear. "Don't involve Father. I'll... think of something."

Cassandra rolled her eyes. "As if you could! No tricks - give me that advance now!"
###Chapter 165

Evelyn pulled out her phone. "Mister Nathaniel likely hasn't gone far. I'll call his assistant and ask him to return."

Cassandra stiffened, suspicion flashing in her eyes. "Wait—why do you have his assistant's number?"

Evelyn shrugged, her expression indifferent. "Oh, I ran into his assistant when I left the restroom earlier. We chatted briefly, and I asked for his contact."

Cassandra scoffed, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "And why would you need that? Planning to seduce him too?"

Evelyn shook her head, feigning innocence. "No, nothing like that. I'm your assistant now, and you're paying me well. It's only right I take my job seriously. I thought having his contact might help secure resources for your work. Dad also reminded me this morning to be more grateful and assist you however I can."

Cassandra studied her for a long moment before letting out a derisive laugh. "Good to see you're finally learning your place. Well? Call him. Let's see if you can actually get Mister Nathaniel to come back."

Evelyn lowered her gaze and dialed the number.

The call connected quickly. "Miss Evelyn?" Lucas's voice was polite but guarded.

Evelyn softened her tone. "Mister Lucas, could you please tell Mister Nathaniel that I regret my earlier actions? I'd like him to return so we can have lunch together."

Lucas hesitated, caught off guard by her uncharacteristic politeness. "I'm sorry, Miss Evelyn, but Mister Nathaniel is heading back to the company for a meeting. He won't be available for lunch."

Evelyn sighed. "I see."

Cassandra watched her closely, straining to hear the other side of the conversation.

Evelyn paused, then tried again. "What about dinner tonight? I'd like to personally cook for him as an apology. Could you ask if he'd be willing to give me another chance?"

Lucas hesitated. "Uh—hold on a moment. Let me check."

Evelyn nodded. "Of course."

Inside the sleek black Mercedes, Lucas glanced back at Nathaniel, who sat in the rear seat, his sharp features shadowed with irritation. A faint red mark still lingered on his cheek from earlier, his expression colder than usual. He leaned back, eyes closed, his mood unreadable.

One thing was certain—Nathaniel was in a foul temper.

Lucas cleared his throat cautiously. "Sir, Miss Evelyn called. She wishes to apologize for earlier and has invited you to dinner tonight. She offered to cook for you personally."

At the mention of her name, Nathaniel's frown deepened. He didn't open his eyes. "No."

Lucas turned back to the phone. "Miss Evelyn, he—"

Nathaniel's eyes snapped open. "Ask her for the time and place."

Lucas blinked, startled, then quickly relayed the question. After a brief exchange, he hung up and turned back. "She said dinner will be at eight tonight in room 808 at the Starlight Hotel."

Nathaniel's gaze darkened. "A hotel room?"
###Chapter 166

Elsewhere...

Evelyn Whitmore set down her phone with a satisfied sigh, pulling up a chair at the lavish dining table. Her stomach growled loudly - she hadn't eaten since breakfast.

The dinner arrangements she'd just discussed with Lucas Sinclair weren't actually her idea. Cassandra Blackwood had been listening in on the call, pressing her ear against the phone. The moment Nathaniel Grayson accepted the invitation, Cassandra had urgently whispered instructions to book the hotel venue. Evelyn saw no reason to object and relayed the details accordingly.

Just as Evelyn picked up her fork, Cassandra snatched it from her hand.

"On your feet! Who said you could sit and eat?" Cassandra sneered.

Evelyn's eyebrows knitted together. "I solved your problem. Don't I deserve a meal?"

Cassandra's lip curled in disdain. "What problem? Nathaniel didn't come back for lunch with me, did he? Sure, you arranged dinner, but that doesn't make up for this wasted meal!"

Evelyn gestured at the extravagant spread. "You ordered enough for ten people. You can't possibly finish all this alone."

"I'll take the leftovers home if I have to," Cassandra snapped. "This food isn't for peasants like you. Do you even know what fine dining is? The Wild Bites would be insulted if they knew their cuisine was being wasted on some backwater hick!"

A cold smirk crossed Evelyn's face as she stood. "Fine. I'm leaving."

Cassandra's eyes flashed with rage. "Leaving? Where do you think you're going?"

"I took the afternoon off, remember? I'm going home to rest."

"That permission is revoked! Evelyn Whitmore, don't you dare— Evelyn!" Cassandra shrieked as Evelyn walked away without looking back.

Just as Cassandra moved to physically stop her, her phone rang. The caller ID showed her mother, Victoria Blackwood. She couldn't ignore it.

"Mom?" Cassandra answered through gritted teeth.

"Cassandra, how did the Newmoon Group meeting go?" Victoria's anxious voice came through the line.

Glaring at Evelyn's retreating figure, Cassandra replied, "Practically settled. But I've got another issue now. Come to The Wild Bites immediately. I ordered too much food!"

"The Wild Bites? Why would you dine somewhere so expensive?"

"Ugh! It's all Evelyn's fault! Just get here and I'll explain. And don't tell Daddy!" Cassandra hissed.

"Alright, I'm on my way," Victoria agreed.

Twenty minutes later, Victoria swept into the restaurant.

"Cassandra, what happened? Tell me everything," she demanded as she sat down.

Over the next several minutes, Cassandra recounted every detail - from her first encounter with Nathaniel to the dinner she'd arranged at the hotel that very evening.

Victoria practically glowed with excitement. "Brilliant move booking the hotel! This is your golden opportunity to become Nathaniel Grayson's woman!"
###Chapter 167

Despite everything, Cassandra felt uneasy. "Mother, I do admire Mister Nathaniel, but he's already married. That's what makes me hesitate. What if—"

Victoria Blackwood waved off her daughter's concern with a dismissive flick of her wrist. "Married? So what? Need I remind you how I took your father from his first wife? Look where that got me. If his wife can't keep him, that's her failure. In this world, you have to fight for what you want, Cassandra. Trust me—being Mister Nathaniel's mistress is far better than settling for some mediocre man. You're young, beautiful. Who's to say you won't replace her one day?"

It sounded logical, but Cassandra still wavered. "But he's so distant, so unapproachable. I don't even know how to get close to him."

Victoria smirked. "He's the heir to the Grayson empire, raised with power and privilege. Of course he's cold. But don't worry. After lunch, I'm taking you shopping for something special."

Cassandra perked up. "What is it?"

"You'll see," Victoria said, her lips curling into a sly smile.

Though her mother was being cryptic, Cassandra trusted her. Victoria always had a plan, always knew how to manipulate situations to her advantage.

After their meal at The Wild Bites, Victoria led Cassandra to a bustling market.

Even with a wide-brimmed hat and oversized sunglasses, Cassandra wrinkled her nose in distaste. The place reeked of fish and sweat. "Mother, why are we here?"

Victoria's grin turned predatory. "You're cooking for Mister Nathaniel tonight, aren't you? You need ingredients."

Cassandra scoffed. "You know I can't cook. I'll just order takeout and pretend I made it."

Victoria pulled her aside, lowering her voice. "Foolish girl. Listen carefully. I'm buying cordyceps and fennel. When cooked together, they have... certain effects. Let's just say, after tonight, Mister Nathaniel won't be able to resist you."

Cassandra's cheeks flushed as she clutched the bag of ingredients, her heart racing. Her mother was a genius.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Whitmore hailed a taxi back to the Grayson estate. As she approached the gates, a white van pulled up beside her.

The driver rolled down the window, flashing a greasy smile. "Excuse me, miss. Do you know where the Grayson estate is?"

Evelyn eyed him warily. "Why do you need to know?"

The man chuckled, adjusting his sunglasses. "Got a delivery for them. Groceries, vegetables, fruits—all in the back."

Evelyn frowned, stepping closer to peer into the van—

The side door slid open.

A masked figure lunged forward, spraying a mist into her face.

Her vision blurred.

Her knees buckled.

Before she hit the ground, strong hands yanked her inside.

The door slammed shut.

The van sped away.
###Chapter 168

The clock struck eight when Nathaniel arrived at the Moonlight Hotel.

The receptionist handed him a keycard to Suite 808 with a polite smile. "The lady guest arranged this earlier," she informed him.

Nathaniel took the elevator up, his polished shoes clicking against the marble floors. The suite door clicked open to reveal lavish interiors bathed in warm lighting.

No one greeted him in the sitting area. Only the rhythmic sound of running water from the bathroom broke the silence.

His dark gaze flickered toward the frosted glass door where a feminine silhouette moved behind the steam. He clenched his jaw, forcing his eyes away.

The dining table caught his attention instead. Six steaming dishes and a fragrant soup were arranged with care. His brows lifted in surprise.

Had Evelyn actually cooked for him? Theodore had mentioned her occasional kitchen experiments, but Nathaniel never imagined the spoiled brat could produce something edible.

A handwritten note rested beside the cutlery:

*Dearest Mr. Grayson,
Please enjoy the meal while it's hot.
I'll join you shortly after freshening up.

E*
"Dearest?" Nathaniel's lips twitched. Since when did the little hellion use endearments?

He sat at the table, unfolding the napkin with deliberate movements. The first bite surprised him—not Michelin-star quality, but far from disastrous. There was something... comforting about the flavors.

Between bites, his mind wandered. Twenty days. That's all it took for Evelyn Whitmore to carve a space in his regimented life. Her defiant smirks, the way her nose scrunched when annoyed, even her infuriating comebacks—all inexplicably endearing.

The memory of their heated kiss surfaced unbidden. His fingers tightened around the fork. Perhaps it was time to reconsider their arrangement.

The bathroom door swung open.

Cassandra emerged wrapped in a towel, feigning shock when she spotted him. "Oh! Mr. Grayson! I didn't realize you'd arrived already—"

Nathaniel's chair scraped back violently. "You."

Cassandra blinked. "Who else would invite you to dinner?" She took a calculated step forward, letting the towel slip just as she pretended to stumble. "Oh! My ankle—"

Nathaniel didn't move to help. His voice turned glacial. "Where. Is. Evelyn?"
###Chapter 169

Nathaniel's footsteps echoed through the hallway, each step making Cassandra's heart race faster.

He's coming. The man I've dreamed of. The one who's supposed to sweep me into his arms.

But her hope shattered instantly.

Nathaniel strode past her without so much as a glance, his gaze fixed straight ahead as he headed for the door. He didn't even spare her a downward look.

Cassandra froze. Her hand shot out, desperation lacing her voice. "M-Mister Nathaniel? Mister Nathaniel! Why are you leaving? Where are you going? Don't go! My leg—it hurts... Help me!"

He didn't pause. Didn't hesitate. Just walked away.

She scrambled to her feet, ready to chase after him—but then reality crashed down. She was naked. Exposed. Even if she grabbed her clothes now, it wouldn't matter.

What went wrong? This wasn't supposed to happen!

Victoria had assured her the ingredients would work. That it would only take minutes for any man to succumb.

The silverware on the table had been moved—proof Nathaniel had eaten. So why? Why hadn't he reacted to her? To her body?

Nathaniel stormed out of the elevator, his expression dark, his jaw clenched so tight it could crack stone.

Minutes ago, he'd been considering giving Evelyn another chance. Maybe even talking things through.

And then?

She'd lured him here with sweet words—only to set him up with some scheming woman.

How generous of her. She doesn’t even care if I fall into another woman’s arms. That little—

His fist tightened, knuckles white with fury.

His phone buzzed. An unknown number.

He answered coldly.

"Nathaniel Grayson! Aren't you worried about your wife? She's not home yet. Didn't you even notice?"

His voice was ice. "Who is this?"

"You don’t need to know. I have Evelyn."

A humorless smirk twisted his lips. "Keep her, then. Do whatever you want with her."

The kidnapper choked. "What the hell? She's your wife!"

Nathaniel didn't flinch. "Wives can be replaced."

He hung up without another word.

In the abandoned warehouse, the kidnapper spat on the ground, glaring at Evelyn, bound to a chair.

"Damn it! I thought you meant something to him. Turns out you're worthless!"

The call had been on speaker. Every word. Every chilling note of indifference.

Evelyn closed her eyes.

She wasn’t surprised.

But the disappointment still cut deep.

Her lips curled into a bitter smile.

She’d actually believed him when he said he’d give her anything—except his heart.

How foolish.

She was just a tool. Disposable.

And he hadn’t even hesitated to prove it.
###Chapter 170

Evelyn's mouth was taped shut, but her wide eyes and muffled sounds caught the man's attention.

She needed to speak to him.

The kidnapper—a heavyset man—considered her request before yanking the tape off. He'd only silenced her to prevent screaming in the city.

Out here in the wilderness, no one would hear her anyway.

The moment the tape was gone, Evelyn inhaled sharply. "Since you know threatening Nathaniel won't work, why not just let me go?"

The man snorted. "Let you go? After all this effort?" His gaze raked over her. "You're a pretty thing. Maybe we should have some fun first."

Evelyn smirked. "Fun? Sure. But untie me first. I don't enjoy being restrained."

Her cooperation stunned them. The kidnappers exchanged glances, unsure how to react.

The leader narrowed his eyes. "Don't try anything, sweetheart."

She blinked innocently. "What could I possibly do? You're all so much stronger than me." Her lips curved. "Unless... you're scared of a helpless girl?"

He grinned, licking his lips. "Force isn't my style. I prefer willing participants."

Evelyn sighed, feigning disappointment. "But these ropes ruin the mood." She lowered her voice. "Let me be honest—I used to work a special job to pay for school. I know how to please men." She gave them a knowing look. "And I promise, you've never experienced anything like me."

The men erupted into laughter. "Oh yeah? Where'd you work?"

"Twilight."

Their eyes widened. "That high-end club in the city?" The leader licked his lips. "Untie her. Let's see what a classy escort can do."

One of the men eagerly loosened her bonds.

Evelyn stretched, rolling her shoulders before flashing a sultry smile. "So... where should we begin?"

The leader pointed to a nearby crate. "Right here."

She pretended to hesitate. "Here? With them watching?"

His grin turned predatory. "They won't just watch. They'll join."

Evelyn gasped—then giggled. "Even better. The more, the merrier."

The men stared, stunned.

"This innocent-looking girl is wild!"

"Perfect! I like 'em feisty!"

Evelyn sauntered forward, undoing a button with deliberate slowness. The leader's breath hitched, his hands twitching toward her.

Impatient, he reached for her shirt—

And she moved.

Her knee slammed into his gut, sending him crashing backward, retching.

The others froze, grins vanishing.

The leader wheezed, clutching his stomach. "You bitch! Kill her!"

They lunged.

Evelyn didn't flinch.

One by one, she dismantled them—twisting wrists, sweeping legs, snapping bones with brutal precision. Soon, they were groaning on the ground, broken.

She stepped on the leader's chest, rolling her wrist. "Let me clarify. Twilight is a high-end club—but we don't offer those services." Her smile turned icy. "I trained their security team. Taught them how to handle scum like you."

The men whimpered, staring at her like she was the devil.

And for the first time, they realized—

They'd kidnapped the wrong woman.
###Chapter 171

Evelyn was exhausted. With one final kick to the overweight kidnapper, she turned to leave.

The screech of rusted metal echoed through the warehouse as the iron door swung open from the outside.

Someone was coming in.

A man stood in the doorway, his silver-dyed hair catching the dim light. A blue diamond stud glinted in his left earlobe.

Evelyn tensed, taking cautious steps back as she assessed him.

The injured kidnappers groaned on the floor, some with broken bones. Yet, at the sight of the silver-haired man, their faces lit up with desperate relief.

"Boss!"

"Thank God you're here! Don't let her get away!"

As he stepped closer, Evelyn got a clear look at his face. His features were sharp, almost too perfect—except for the jagged scar running down his left cheek. It twisted his handsome face into something cruel.

Without hesitation, the silver-haired man stomped on the fat kidnapper's chest. "Pathetic. Can't even handle one woman?"

The man howled in agony, his eyes bulging before he blacked out.

Evelyn's stomach tightened. This wasn't just another thug—he was the one behind this.

"Who are you?" she demanded.

His cold gaze raked over her like she was already dead. "You don't deserve to know."

She didn't flinch. "So, you're here to finish what they started?"

A sneer curled his lips. "Every woman Nathaniel Grayson touches is tainted. Disgusting."

In one swift motion, he pulled a pistol from behind his back and leveled it at her head.

Evelyn's pulse spiked, but her voice stayed steady. "We don't even know each other. Killing me gains you nothing."

His smile was feral, a predator's grin. "Dead hostages don't cause problems later."

His finger tightened on the trigger—

Then his phone rang.

He hesitated, lowering the gun just enough to check the caller. Whatever was said made his expression darken.

"What? How bad is it? I'm on my way."

The moment he turned his back, Evelyn bolted.

One of the men shouted, "Boss! She jumped out the window!"

The silver-haired man whirled, teeth bared in fury. "Damn it!"

But he didn't chase her. He had bigger problems now.

Next time, though—she wouldn't escape.

Above, the roar of helicopter blades cut through the sky.

Lucas, gripping the controls, shouted over the noise. "Sir! Surveillance confirmed the van's location. They're in that abandoned warehouse below!"

Nathaniel's jaw clenched. "Land. Now."
###Chapter 172

Evelyn barely escaped the abandoned warehouse, stumbling through the wilderness without her phone. Her captors must have discarded it when they took her.

The night was ink-black, thick clouds smothering any trace of moonlight. Direction became impossible to discern. Evelyn searched desperately for shelter to wait out the night until dawn could guide her back.

This barren landscape offered worse refuge than any jungle. At least a jungle would have caves. Here, only thorny brambles clawed at her legs - not even a single tree for cover.

Cold raindrops began pelting her skin. With nowhere to hide, she could only endure the downpour.

Then - footsteps. Crunching through underbrush. A flashlight beam cutting erratic patterns through the darkness. Only her kidnappers would be searching these wilds.

Evelyn froze, holding her breath as she ducked behind a dense thicket.

The steps grew louder. Closer. Suddenly, a tall figure stood barely three feet away, his blinding flashlight beam sweeping directly over her hiding spot.

"Come out." The command sliced through the rain, sharp as a blade.

Realizing she'd been discovered, Evelyn grabbed a handful of wet earth. She lunged from the bushes, flinging mud at the man's face to blind him momentarily.

Against an armed opponent, this was her only chance to flee.

But he moved like lightning. Sidestepping the attack, his hand clamped around her wrist like a steel trap.

As Evelyn twisted to strike with her free hand-

"It's me." That voice. Deep. Steady. Unmistakable.

Close enough now to recognize, the familiar timbre sent shockwaves through her.

Then - warmth. Strong arms enveloped her as Nathaniel pulled her against his chest. One broad hand cradled the back of her head, fingers threading through rain-soaked hair. "Easy now. You're safe."

Evelyn's rigid muscles unlocked all at once. "Sir, how did you-"

"Are you hurt?"

Nathaniel's usual composure had fractured. Tension vibrated through his words as he pushed her to arm's length, scanning every inch under the flashlight's glow. His piercing gaze missed nothing.

She shook her head, rainwater dripping from her lashes. This made no sense. Hadn't he told her kidnappers to do their worst? Hadn't he slammed down the phone without negotiating?

The rain intensified.

Finding no visible injuries, Nathaniel exhaled sharply. He shrugged out of his coat, draping it over Evelyn's shoulders like a shield against the storm. "Forgive my delay," he murmured, voice rough.

Evelyn studied him silently. This tenderness felt foreign. Unfamiliar.

Yet delay? Impossible. Less than thirty minutes had passed since that threatening call. Even speeding from the city would take two hours.

How had he reached her so quickly?

"Sir!"

Lucas sprinted toward them, umbrella snapping open to shelter Nathaniel. Relief washed over his face at seeing Evelyn. "Thank God you found her! Miss Whitmore, are you injured?"

Evelyn gave a small shake of her head. "I'm unharmed."
###Chapter 173

"Thank goodness!" Lucas exhaled sharply in relief. If anything happened to Evelyn, Nathaniel would undoubtedly lose his temper.

After today's events, Lucas could clearly see Nathaniel's feelings for Evelyn had far exceeded what one should feel for a contractual wife.

Nathaniel cared deeply about Evelyn—perhaps too deeply.

"Sir, the storm's intensifying. The helicopter can't fly in this weather. I've arranged for the nearest car to pick you up—it's here now. You and Miss Evelyn should get in."

That explained everything to Evelyn. 'No wonder they arrived so quickly. They came by helicopter.'

Nathaniel gave his orders sharply. "Stay until the police arrive. Ensure every kidnapper is captured. Not a single one escapes."

"Yes, sir!" Lucas nodded firmly. "Understood!"

Without another word, Nathaniel scooped Evelyn into his arms and strode toward the waiting car, with Lucas shielding them from the rain with an umbrella.

Flustered, Evelyn squirmed in his hold. "Mr. Grayson, I'm perfectly fine. I can walk—"

Nathaniel tightened his grip, his voice dropping dangerously low. "Stop moving. One more wiggle and I'll toss you into that ditch."

Evelyn froze instantly, pressing her lips together in annoyance. 'This man can't stay decent for more than three seconds!'

He deposited her gently into the passenger seat, leaning close to fasten her seatbelt. Their faces nearly touched in the confined space.

Uncomfortable with the proximity, Evelyn reached for the belt herself. Her hand brushed against Nathaniel's chest as she pulled it across—accidentally yanking him downward.

Nathaniel lost his balance, his chin bumping against her collarbone. As he turned his head, his lips accidentally grazed the delicate skin of her neck.

His pupils dilated instantly. A dry heat crawled up his throat as he swallowed hard, quickly straightening himself.

The unexpected contact sent electric jolts through Evelyn's body. She turned away abruptly, blinking rapidly to hide her embarrassment.

Nathaniel stood by the door, gazing down at her with smoldering intensity. The little minx looked... dangerously alluring.

Slamming her door shut, he loosened his tie irritably before circling to the driver's seat.

The car moved through the wilderness as rain hammered against the windshield, wipers working overtime.

The silence between them grew thick with tension.

Finally, Evelyn cleared her throat. "Didn't you say you didn't care what happened to me? That the kidnappers could do whatever they wanted? What changed your mind?"

Nathaniel kept his eyes on the road. "You heard everything?"

She propped her chin on her hand, staring out the window. "Every word," she muttered. "And I still think you're a jerk."

"If I'd shown concern," Nathaniel explained calmly, "they would've kept their guard up. Might've even tortured you to provoke me."

"Besides, I needed to handle this discreetly. If word gets out that kidnapping you works, you'll never have peace—even after our arrangement ends."

'Hmm... He has a point.' Evelyn conceded silently. 'With Nathaniel's status, people will always look for weaknesses to exploit.'

She turned to him with a sarcastic smirk. "So you admit you're nothing but trouble for me."

Her playful expression—raised eyebrows, full lips parting to reveal white teeth—sent an unexpected heat through Nathaniel's veins.

His grip tightened on the steering wheel. A familiar, primal hunger stirred within him, spreading like wildfire through his body.

Without warning, he slammed the brakes. Evelyn lurched forward, saved only by her seatbelt.

She shot him an incredulous look. "What the hell, Nathaniel?"

"Get out," he commanded coldly.

Evelyn blinked in disbelief. "Are you insane? It's pouring! What did I do now?"
###Chapter 174

Nathaniel's grip on the steering wheel tightened, his knuckles turning white. "Get out. Move to the back seat," he ordered through clenched teeth.

Evelyn's temper flared. She hadn't said anything offensive, yet Nathaniel was suddenly furious. The man was utterly unreasonable!

If her mere presence irritated him, she'd gladly stay away.

"Fine! I'll move. The backseat is quieter anyway—no need to look at his scowling face," she fumed silently.

She unbuckled her seatbelt and reached for the door handle, throwing him one last glare. That's when she noticed the prominent veins bulging in Nathaniel's hands as he strangled the steering wheel like it was his lifeline.

Frowning, she hesitated. "Nathaniel... are you okay?"

He didn't answer. "Get. Out. Now," he ground out.

Something was clearly wrong. Evelyn shut the half-opened door and turned fully toward him. "If you're unwell, you shouldn't be driving. It's dangerous," she said firmly. "Let me take the wheel."

Nathaniel suddenly turned to face her. His eyes were glazed over, pupils dilated with an unnatural redness.

Evelyn recoiled. "What's wrong with you—mmph!"

Before she could finish, Nathaniel seized the back of her neck and crushed his lips against hers in a desperate, consuming kiss.

Shock immobilized her. Her eyes flew wide as she shoved against his chest.

Is he insane? We're stopped in the middle of the road!

The kiss deepened, but it wasn't enough for Nathaniel. He needed more—much more.

Furious, Evelyn bit down hard on his lower lip.

The sharp pain jolted Nathaniel back to awareness. With tremendous effort, he shoved her away, swiping blood from his mouth with his thumb. Breathing heavily, he warned, "If you don't want me to lose control completely and do worse, get in the back now."

His flushed skin, erratic breathing, and feverish temperature were all wrong.

Realization struck Evelyn. Her anger about the forced kiss evaporated. She grabbed his wrist, checking his pulse. "What did you eat tonight?" she demanded.

Nathaniel fought to suppress the fire raging through him. "What do you think?" he rasped.

A terrible suspicion formed. "Did you meet Cassandra at the Celestial Bloom Hotel?"

Even through his haze, the mention of the hotel enraged him. "Wasn't it you who invited me there? Promised to cook me an apology dinner?" he sneered.

Evelyn palmed her forehead. Of course. Cassandra had drugged him, and it was kicking in now.

Cassandra and her mother were obsessed with trapping wealthy, powerful men. They'd use any means necessary.

But why would Nathaniel, usually so cautious, fall for it? Unless...

Her stomach dropped. He must have thought she prepared the food.

Evelyn kept her grip light, avoiding further contact. "Tell me exactly what you ate."

Nathaniel's pulse raced beneath her fingers. "Some... mushroom dish. With vegetables."

Cordyceps. The realization hit her like a truck.

She'd read about this rare mushroom's aphrodisiac effects. Consumed alone, it enhanced intimacy. But paired with fennel? It became unstoppable.

And there was only one cure.

Evelyn released his wrist like it burned her. "Nathaniel... you've been poisoned. That mushroom is affecting you now."

The unspoken truth hung between them—he needed to sleep with someone, or the toxin would drive him mad.
###Chapter 175

Nathaniel fought against the unfamiliar heat coursing through his veins, his grip tightening on the steering wheel. He understood now.

Evelyn studied him with concern, tilting her head. "Can you still drive? Maybe I should take over."

"No." The engine roared to life as his fingers clenched around the wheel. "Move to the back."

"Fine." She understood his reasoning now, her earlier irritation fading. But with the storm raging outside, she didn't bother exiting. Instead, she climbed over the console into the backseat.

The moment she settled, Nathaniel activated the privacy partition, dividing the car into two separate spaces. Yet the thin barrier couldn't mute the sound of their synchronized breathing.

Evelyn bit her lip. She couldn't ignore Nathaniel's struggle, nor pretend she didn't understand what was happening.

The rain worsened, flooding the streets until driving became dangerous. Nathaniel pulled into a roadside motel's parking lot.

"Only one room left," the clerk announced.

Evelyn's stomach twisted. Normally, sharing a room with Nathaniel wouldn't faze her. They'd done it countless times at home - her on the bed, him on the sofa, maintaining careful distance.

But tonight was different. Whatever Cassandra had slipped into his system had ignited something primal. What if his control snapped?

Before she could protest, Nathaniel took the key card. "We'll take it."

Her head whipped toward him, eyes wide with alarm.

His expression remained unreadable as he dragged her toward the elevator. The confined space amplified every ragged breath, every tense movement between them.

When their gazes accidentally locked, the silent understanding between them was almost painful. She knew his torment. He recognized her fear.

Evelyn looked away first.

Inside the room, Nathaniel immediately disappeared into the bathroom, slamming the door behind him. The sound brought temporary relief.

She sank onto the bed, mind racing. She hadn't told Nathaniel everything in the car.

The medical text she'd read warned against combining cordyceps and fennel - the mixture created a toxin requiring sexual release to neutralize. Without it? Paralysis for mild cases. For severe doses? Death by internal hemorrhage.

Only Nathaniel knew how much he'd consumed.

Cassandra's cruelty knew no bounds. A simple aphrodisiac would've been manageable. But this? She'd engineered a situation where Nathaniel would have no choice but to surrender to her.

Except Cassandra hadn't anticipated their escape.

Time was critical. Evelyn needed information. She patted her pockets - her phone was gone, discarded by their captors. But Nathaniel's coat still held his device.

Her frantic searches yielded nothing. Then she spotted Benjamin's contact in the call log.

An idea sparked. Her fingers flew across the screen.
###Chapter 176

The call connected almost instantly.

"Hello?" Benjamin's voice was hushed, barely audible. "Nathaniel, I'm in the middle of homework. What's going on?"

"It's me," Evelyn answered.

"Evelyn?" Benjamin blurted, his tone sharp with surprise.

He cleared his throat quickly, forcing his voice into something more composed. "Evelyn, why are you calling from Nathaniel's phone?"

"Is your sister home?" she asked.

The question threw him off. "Why? What do you need her for?"

Evelyn hesitated. She couldn’t explain Nathaniel’s condition to Benjamin—he was too young to be dragged into this.

"Um... Nathaniel really needs her right now. Is she free to come over?"

Benjamin frowned. Something wasn’t right. "She’s not in the country. It’ll be a while before she’s back. Why does Nathaniel need my sister? Why didn’t he just call her himself?"

Evelyn bit her lip. Amelia wouldn’t be able to help in time.

"Never mind. Bye."

Benjamin wasn’t having it. "Hey! Wait—"

She didn’t have time to explain. Ending the call, she exhaled sharply. Her plan had been simple—bring the one woman Nathaniel still cared about, solve the problem, and give them a chance to reconnect. Two birds, one stone.

Except Amelia wasn’t here.

Evelyn sighed, rubbing her temples. Then, Nathaniel’s phone buzzed again. She expected Benjamin calling back, but the screen flashed with Dominic’s name.

Her first instinct was to call Nathaniel from the bathroom, but she caught herself just in time.

After a beat, she answered.

"Hey, Nathaniel, where are you?" Dominic’s voice was light, teasing. Nothing urgent.

"It’s me," Evelyn said.

Dominic chuckled. "Evelyn! Where’s Nathaniel?"

"He’s... in the shower. Can’t talk right now."

A pause. Then, Dominic’s laugh deepened. "Oh. Got it. Sorry for interrupting."

It took her a second to realize what he meant. Heat rushed to her cheeks. "Wait! Don’t hang up!"

Dominic hesitated. "Huh? What’s up?"

Evelyn glanced at the rain outside, thinking fast. "Does Nathaniel have any ex-girlfriends?"

Dominic nearly choked on his drink. "What? You want me to dig up his past for you?"

"No," she said quickly. "I mean, can you help me contact one of them? Someone who could come talk to him tonight?"

Dominic coughed. "You—you want me to call one of his exes to come over? Right now?"

Evelyn nodded, then realized he couldn’t see her. "Yes. He’s in a... unique situation. He needs—"

A hand reached past her, snatching the phone.

Evelyn spun around.

Nathaniel stood behind her, his expression unreadable.
###Chapter 177

Nathaniel emerged from the bathroom, his damp hair tousled, the white robe clinging to his frame. Though his posture appeared relaxed, his stormy expression betrayed the calm facade—dark intensity swirling in his gaze like a predator cornering its prey.

Evelyn startled, nearly dropping her phone. "When did you—Mr. Grayson?"

The cold shower had only temporarily dulled the fire in Nathaniel's veins. Spotting Evelyn by the window, her hushed conversation piqued his suspicion. His eyes dropped to the glowing screen still displaying an active call. With a sharp jab of his thumb, he ended it.

His voice dripped with barely restrained fury. "Searching for my ex-girlfriend now, Evelyn?"

She met his glare without flinching. "You need help. I was just—"

"Just arranging another woman for me?" The words cracked like a whip.

Evelyn nodded. "Yes. Though I couldn't locate Amelia. Perhaps you should contact her directly—"

Nathaniel's laugh held no humor. His fingers twitched at his sides. "How generous of you, Mrs. Grayson. Eager to share your husband, are we?"

She'd practically gift-wrapped him for another woman this morning. Had he stayed longer at that hotel... His jaw clenched at the thought.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "This is an emergency solution. I'm trying to help."

"Help?" Nathaniel stepped closer, the scent of her shampoo making his pulse spike. "Then help me yourself."

She recoiled, back hitting the wall. "I'm hardly your preferred—"

His hand shot out, tilting her chin up. "When a man's dying of thirst, Evelyn, he doesn't care if the water's served in crystal or plastic."

Alarm bells rang in Evelyn's mind. She edged sideways. "If standards aren't an issue, I could check the lobby for... professional services."

The audacity. The absolute gall.

Desire and rage twisted together in Nathaniel's gut, burning hotter than before. She truly didn't care. The realization stung more than the drugs coursing through him.

As Evelyn tried to dart past, his arm snaked around her waist. One practiced motion pinned both wrists behind her back, forcing her onto tiptoes. Their faces hovered inches apart.

"Release me!" She twisted futilely.

Nathaniel caged her against the wall, knee wedged between hers. His breath scorched her cheek. "Why settle for strangers when my wife's right here?"

Evelyn turned her face away, but his grip on her chin wrenched it back. "So desperate to pawn me off?" His thumb traced her lower lip. "Afraid of what might happen if you stay?"

Every ragged breath fanned the flames. Control unraveled by the second.

Evelyn gulped air. "Mr. Grayson, remember—I'm not your type!"

The protest died as his mouth crashed onto hers.
###Chapter 178

Nathaniel's gaze burned with raw hunger as he pinned Evelyn against the wall like a predator cornering its prey. "What if I say you're exactly my type now?"

A deafening crack of thunder split the sky. The gentle drizzle transformed into a violent storm within seconds, wind howling through the trees.

Evelyn blinked in disbelief before letting out a dry laugh. "Hear that? Even the heavens think you're full of it. One lightning strike coming right up for your pathetic attempt at seduction."

Seduction?

Nathaniel's jaw clenched, veins pulsing visibly at his temples.

She sighed dramatically. "The toxin's messing with your head. I get it—you'd jump anything in a skirt right now."

She 'got it'?

"Evelyn Whitmore!" His voice was a growl, hot breath laced with expensive tobacco brushing her lips. "What the hell do you take me for?"

Evelyn squared her shoulders, defiance flashing in her eyes. "A man who's one bad decision away from becoming a walking hormone bomb!"

"Damn straight I am!" Nathaniel snarled, chest heaving. Every ragged breath betrayed his crumbling self-control.

Without warning, he crushed his mouth against hers.

Evelyn's eyes flew wide. She twisted violently, teeth sinking into his lower lip. The metallic tang of blood shocked him into releasing her.

Panting, Nathaniel staggered back. He turned abruptly, fists white-knuckled at his sides. Heavy footsteps echoed as he headed for the door.

"Wait!" Evelyn called out, voice unsteady despite her relief. "Where are you going?"

"Car." The word was gritted out. "Be ready by seven tomorrow."

Every nerve in his body screamed—fire ants crawling beneath his skin. Staying meant disaster.

Truth was, he'd never consider forcing her. Not even when he found her calling contacts to arrange some random woman for him after his cold shower failed. Twenty minutes of icy water wasted because of this infuriating woman.

Evelyn bit her lip, watching his retreating form. Paralysis. Death. The grim outcomes flashed through her mind if he didn't get relief.

Twenty-three days together. The auction bid. Countless small kindnesses beneath his gruff exterior.

Outside, rain lashed the windows like bullets. No woman would make it through this storm in time.

A life-altering choice loomed: let a good man suffer permanent damage... or become his solution.

Her stomach twisted. Virginity aside, Nathaniel got poisoned because of Cassandra. Because of her.

And still, he'd raced through the storm to save her tonight.
###Chapter 179

If Evelyn chose to walk away now, leaving Nathaniel to suffer alone, the guilt would gnaw at her conscience forever.

She drew a sharp breath. "Wait! I'll help you."

Nathaniel froze mid-step, pulse thundering in his ears.

His control warred with primal need like a starving wolf resisting fresh prey. Only sheer willpower kept him from lunging at her.

His gaze turned predatory. "Why?"

Evelyn approached, fingers trembling as she untied his robe. "This is crisis intervention. Humanitarian aid. And..." She swallowed hard. "You're objectively attractive. I'm not exactly sacrificing here."

Each clinical word struck like a slap. No passion, just cold logic.

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "If any decent man stood here instead of me, you'd offer the same...charity?"

"Probably," she admitted.

The admission ignited his fury.

'So I'm nothing special. Just another charity case.'

He yanked her against him, voice dripping venom. "How noble. Then by all means, saintly Evelyn, save me."

Her protest died beneath his bruising kiss.

When he tossed her onto the bed, his heated gaze raked over her. "Last chance to back out."

Eyes squeezed shut, she muttered, "I don't regret doing the right thing."

A dark chuckle rumbled through him. "Too late for regrets now." His lips traced her collarbone. "Let's see how merciful you feel by dawn."

Evelyn's breath hitched. She told herself this was purely medicinal, ignoring the treacherous heat coiling in her stomach.

This way, she could pretend nothing changed between them. Partners. Business associates. Nothing more.

Dawn painted the room gold when Evelyn stirred, every muscle screaming in protest.

The empty bed still radiated Nathaniel's warmth. Wincing, she wrapped herself in a robe and limped toward muffled voices in the hallway.

Lucas was speaking urgently.

"...the kidnappers are locked up, but their boss walked free. Solid alibi, no digital trail. Police had to release him."

"Find him," Nathaniel commanded. "I'll handle the rest."

The door swung open, revealing Evelyn leaning heavily against the doorframe.

Nathaniel's eyes darkened at her disheveled state. "You're awake."
###Chapter 180

Evelyn blinked up at Nathaniel, her cheeks flushing as she mumbled a sleepy response.

Nathaniel had changed into fresh formal attire—Lucas must have delivered it earlier.

After a moment's hesitation, Evelyn cleared her throat. "My clothes are... ruined. Could you arrange for someone to bring me something to wear?"

Nathaniel's gaze dropped to the torn fabric scattered across the floor. His eyes darkened with the memory of how fiercely he'd claimed her. Last night would forever be seared into his memory.

He reached for a shopping bag nearby. "Lucas picked these up. They might not fit perfectly, but they'll do until we get home."

Evelyn accepted the bag with a quiet "Thanks" before disappearing into the bathroom.

The simple dress inside was exactly what she'd expect from a man's rushed shopping trip. Though slightly oversized, it was wearable enough.

When she emerged, she found Nathaniel smoking on the balcony, his broad shoulders silhouetted against the morning light. "I should get going," she announced to his back.

Nathaniel turned, exhaling smoke as his displeased gaze swept over her. "Come here," he commanded.

Evelyn hesitated but approached, stopping an arm's length away. "Yes?"

Crushing his cigarette, he leaned against the railing. "Still calling me 'Mister'?"

Evelyn frowned. "What else would I call you?"

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed. "What do wives call their husbands?"

Heat flooded Evelyn's face. "Stop teasing me. I helped you last night—this isn't funny!"

"Teasing?" Nathaniel's lips curled. "How generous of you to save me. I should be grateful."

Evelyn's jaw tightened. She'd acted of her own free will—no coercion, no ulterior motives. Just pure necessity.

Without warning, Nathaniel closed the distance. His calloused fingers tilted her chin up before his lips claimed hers.

Evelyn stiffened but didn't pull away. After last night's intimacy, his touch no longer frightened her—just confused her.

When he finally released her, she frowned. "Is there still poison in your system?"

Nathaniel's expression darkened. Was she truly this oblivious to romance?

At checkout, the receptionist mentioned stubborn red stains on the sheets requiring additional payment.

Evelyn's ears burned crimson. Only she and Nathaniel knew the true nature of those stains.

Amused by her flustered state, Nathaniel tossed a stack of bills on the counter. "Keep the change."

His hand settled possessively on Evelyn's shoulder as they walked to the car. Only when they were inside did she finally breathe, rolling down the window for air.
###Chapter 181

Nathaniel turned his head toward Evelyn. "Where to now?"

"My place, please." She buckled her seatbelt. "Thanks."

The engine roared to life as Nathaniel merged into traffic. His grip tightened on the steering wheel. "Quit that assistant job. I had Lucas arrange it so you'd have something to do, not to become someone's errand girl."

Evelyn studied his profile. The sharp jawline. The tension in his shoulders.

As 'Mrs. Grayson', playing assistant to some D-list celebrity did undermine Nathaniel's status. She exhaled. "I'll wrap up loose ends first, then resign."

Silence filled the car until they reached her apartment.

Evelyn hesitated before closing the car door. She leaned through the window. "Can I borrow some cash? Those kidnappers tossed my phone. I'm broke."

Nathaniel's piercing gaze locked onto hers. He flung his phone into her hands. "PIN's my birthday."

She fumbled the catch. "Wait...when's your birthday again?"

His glare could freeze lava. The window shot up as tires screeched against pavement.

Evelyn rolled her eyes, pulling up his Wikipedia page. September 17th. "Subtle," she muttered. "Real subtle."

At the Whitmore residence, Cassandra was mid-tantrum when Evelyn arrived.

"That recipe was supposed to make him lose control!" Cassandra shrieked at Victoria. "Nathaniel didn't even blink when I stripped! Do I repulse him?"

Victoria flipped through her dog-eared copy of 'How to Snare a Billionaire'. "Impossible! This worked on your father! Any man who ingests cordyceps must...oh." Her finger paused on the fine print. "'Only activates when near someone he desires.'"

Cassandra's face crumpled.

The front door clicked open.

"You!" Cassandra whirled on Evelyn. "Give back every cent I paid you, you thieving—"

Evelyn's palm connected with Cassandra's cheek before she finished. The slap echoed through the foyer.

Victoria lunged forward. "You little bitch! How dare you—"

Evelyn stepped back, Nathaniel's phone clutched like a weapon. "Try me."
###Chapter 182

Evelyn wiped her hands slowly after taking a tissue from the box on the table. "Why wouldn't I hit you when the two of you have been scheming behind my back?"

If it weren't for their deceitful tricks, she wouldn't have lost her innocence the night before!

Victoria noticed Evelyn's uncharacteristic behavior and clenched her teeth in fury. "I always knew you were just pretending to be the perfect daughter in front of your father! Now that he's not here, you're finally showing your true colors!"

Evelyn smirked. "Funny, I could say the same about you, Aunt Victoria. All that sweetness and obedience in front of Dad—was that just an act too? Should I spell out what you've been doing behind his back?"

Victoria choked on her words, her face turning red with rage. "How dare you compare yourself to me? You're nothing but a bastard child!"

Cassandra jumped to her mother's defense, sneering, "She's right, Evelyn! A motherless bastard like you has no right to speak! I'll teach you a lesson your shameless mother never did!" With that, she lunged forward, hand raised to strike.

Evelyn didn’t flinch. Instead, she caught Cassandra’s wrist in a firm grip. "I don’t need your lessons. Why don’t you tell me how you really landed that contract with Grayson Entertainment? Go on, say it out loud."

Cassandra froze, her wrist trapped. She lifted her chin defiantly. "Because I’m talented, and they recognized my potential! That’s why they signed me!"

Evelyn shoved her hand away with a cold laugh. "Or maybe it’s because your godfather pulled some strings? Speaking of which—does Dad know you’ve been cozying up to Vincent Blackwood?"

Cassandra scoffed. "What’s wrong with having a godfather? He’s a respected director! And our relationship is purely professional. I’m not afraid of Dad finding out!"

She wasn’t—because if she were, she wouldn’t have bragged about it in the first place.

Evelyn tilted her head. "Oh, I believe your relationship is innocent. But I doubt the same can be said for your mother and him."

Cassandra’s confidence wavered. She shot a nervous glance at Victoria, who remained eerily composed. "What nonsense are you spouting now, Evelyn? Cassandra’s mentors admire her work. There’s nothing unusual about her being someone’s goddaughter. What does this have to do with me?"

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Funny thing—before Vincent became famous, he had a first love. They lived together for years. And guess what? Her name was Victoria Blackwood. Quite the coincidence, don’t you think?"

Victoria’s mask slipped for a split second. "How do you know that?"

Evelyn leaned in. "You’re a beautiful woman, Aunt Victoria. But for an ex-lover to still help your daughter after all these years? Even calling her his goddaughter? Makes me wonder… is Cassandra his daughter too?"

Victoria’s composure shattered. She jabbed a finger at Evelyn. "You’re making outrageous accusations! Where’s your proof?"

Evelyn shrugged. "I don’t have any."

Victoria scoffed, regaining her confidence. "Then keep your mouth shut. If you slander me without evidence, I’ll sue you for defamation!"

Evelyn sighed, turning toward the door. "Fine. I’ll let Dad investigate instead."
###Chapter 183

Victoria let out a sharp laugh. "Don't you dare use Gregory against me! Do you really think I'm afraid to tell you the truth? So what if I cheated on him? What does it matter to you if he's not Cassandra's real father? Do you honestly believe he'll take your word for it without proof? You know how much he adores us! He trusts every word we say, and even when he's angry, all it takes is a little sweet-talking to calm him down. If you accuse us without evidence, he'll just think you're trying to break us apart! Save your breath!"

"Oh? Is that so?" Evelyn's lips curved into a knowing smile as she turned toward the doorway. "Did you catch that, Dad? Aunt Victoria just confessed to cheating on you!"

Both Victoria and Cassandra froze, their faces draining of color as they stared at the entrance.

The door burst open with a crash. Gregory stormed in, his expression thunderous. "You filthy, lying whore!"

Cassandra immediately rushed forward, confident in her father's affection. "Daddy! Please don't be angry! Mom didn't mean what she said—"

Gregory shoved her away violently, sending her sprawling across the floor. "Get the hell away from me! You're probably not even my blood! Always going on about your 'special bond' with your godfather, weren't you? Go live with Vincent then! Don't you dare call me 'Daddy' again!"

Cassandra's voice trembled. "But Dad, I—"

Ignoring her, Gregory marched straight to Victoria and delivered a stinging slap across her face. "After everything I've given you, you still betrayed me!"

Victoria collapsed onto the ground, dazed. When she regained her senses, tears streamed down her face as she shook her head frantically. "No... I didn't! Gregory, I swear I never cheated! I only said those things because Evelyn provoked me!"

Gregory sneered. "Provoked you? Then tell me—weren't you and Vincent involved before we met?"

Victoria's mind raced. Knowing denial would be useless, she switched tactics, adopting a pitiful expression. "Yes... yes we were, but that was years before I met you! There's nothing between us now!"

"Then why would he suddenly become Cassandra's godfather? I bet she's his bastard child!"

"She's not! I swear I only said that to hurt Evelyn! Cassandra is yours! If you don't believe me, we can do a DNA test right now! Evelyn's just jealous of our happy family and wants to destroy it! Gregory, if you doubt me, I'd rather die!"

With dramatic suddenness, Victoria sprang up and dashed toward the wall, slamming her head against it with a sickening thud before collapsing.

Gregory gasped and rushed to her side. "Victoria, you—"

Blood trickled from her forehead as she whispered weakly, "Gregory... you have to believe me... I never betrayed you... Cassandra is your daughter..."

Seeing her desperate act, Gregory's resolve wavered. "Would you... would you really let Cassandra take a paternity test?"
###Chapter 184

Victoria collapsed dramatically into Gregory's arms, letting out two weak coughs. "I've always been truthful with you, Gregory! I'm willing to take any test to prove my innocence! If we don't settle this today, I—" Her words trailed off as her eyelids fluttered shut, her body going limp in feigned agony.

"Mom! Mom, wake up!" Cassandra rushed forward, dropping to her knees beside Victoria. She shook her mother's shoulders desperately, tears streaming down her face. "Don't do this to me! Please, open your eyes!"

Gregory's face paled. "Victoria! Victoria, can you hear me?"

Victoria remained perfectly still, her breathing shallow—a masterful performance.

Cassandra knew her mother was faking, but she played along flawlessly. Her voice trembled with manufactured grief. "Look what you've done, Evelyn! Every time you come back, chaos follows! If Mom doesn't make it, I swear I'll—"

Gregory's gaze flickered between his sobbing eldest daughter and Evelyn, who stood motionless, her expression unreadable. His sympathy naturally swayed toward the one who seemed more distressed—Cassandra.

He rounded on Evelyn, fury in his voice. "Why are you just standing there? Call an ambulance! Do you want your stepmother to die?"

Evelyn's lips curled in cold amusement. The theatrics were almost impressive. Victoria had always been skilled at manipulating Gregory, and Cassandra had inherited the same talent.

No matter how many times they schemed, no matter how cruel their actions, Gregory always forgave them. A few tears, a well-timed faint, and he was wrapped around their fingers.

But Evelyn? Forgotten in the countryside, treated like an outsider. Every mistake was magnified, every kindness erased.

She didn't argue. She simply pulled out her phone and dialed for help.

At the hospital, the doctor confirmed Victoria's injury was minor—just a superficial scratch. A quick disinfection would suffice.

But Victoria groaned dramatically, clutching her head. "Everything's spinning... I feel so sick..."

Cassandra immediately demanded hospitalization. "She needs to be monitored! This could be serious!"

The doctor sighed. "Mild dizziness is normal after a head injury, but if you insist..."

Gregory, ever the doting husband, didn't hesitate. "Admit her. I want her properly examined."

In the private ward, Victoria was hooked to an IV drip—anti-inflammatory, pain relief—her performance rewarded with Gregory's undivided attention. He hovered over her, stroking her hair as if she were on death's door.

Cassandra smirked in satisfaction. Everything was falling back into place.

Then she turned to Evelyn, her voice dripping with venom. "Today was supposed to be perfect. Breakfast with Mom and Dad—happy, peaceful. But the moment you showed up, everything fell apart. What do you even want?"
###Chapter 185

Evelyn maintained her cool composure. "The doctor clearly stated it's just a minor scratch requiring no hospitalization. You're the ones insisting on staying."

Cassandra clenched her teeth, finger jabbing accusingly. "How dare you still argue—"

"Silence!" Gregory snapped, turning red-faced toward Evelyn. "Victoria needs rest. You serve no purpose here—leave before she wakes and gets upset seeing you!"

A smug smile curled Cassandra's lips as her father took her side. Think you can steal our father's affection, Evelyn? Keep dreaming! She mouthed triumphantly: "Serves you right!"

Unfazed by Cassandra's arrogance, Evelyn calmly addressed Gregory. "Weren't you planning a paternity test with Cassandra? Since we're already at the hospital, I'd like to see the results before leaving."

Gregory's expression darkened. "How dare you bring that up now? If not for your actions today, Victoria wouldn't be lying here!"

Seizing the moment, Cassandra spat, "See, Father? Evelyn wants to destroy our family!"

Just then, Victoria stirred awake with a weak whisper. "Evelyn... is right, Gregory..."

Gregory immediately rushed to his wife's side. "Victoria! You're awake! How do you feel?"

Victoria's eyes glistened with forced bravery. "I'm fine. Evelyn's timing is perfect. While we're here, you should take that paternity test with Cassandra."

Guilt washed over Gregory's face. "No need. I trust you completely—"

Victoria interrupted weakly but firmly. "This isn't just about trust. I want all doubts erased permanently. Consider it... clearing my name before Evelyn."

Touched by her apparent selflessness, Gregory's remorse deepened. How could he have doubted such a devoted wife?

Victoria turned to Cassandra. "Take your father for the test now. Get results as quickly as possible."

Understanding flashed in Cassandra's eyes, but she hesitated. "But Mother... who'll watch over you?"

A strained smile touched Victoria's lips. "Evelyn will stay, won't you?"

Cassandra scoffed. "Her? We're lucky she didn't harm you earlier! How can she—"

"Enough!" Victoria chided with practiced maternal sternness. "We're in a hospital—what could possibly happen?"

Reluctantly, Gregory agreed. Before leaving, he warned Evelyn, "If anything happens to your aunt, you'll answer to me."

Evelyn nodded obediently. "Understood, Father."

The moment the door closed, Victoria sprang upright with manic laughter, her sickly pretense vanishing. "Cat got your tongue, Evelyn? Did you really think I'd fear a paternity test?"
###Chapter 186

Evelyn studied Victoria's face with narrowed eyes. "You're absolutely certain about this?"

Victoria threw back her head with manic laughter. "Did you honestly believe I wouldn't know whose child I carried? You've miscalculated terribly if you thought to use this against me, Evelyn! Cassandra is Gregory's daughter! Hahahaha!"

A flicker of irritation crossed Evelyn's features. "But how? Why would Vincent claim another man's child as his own?"

At the mention of Vincent, Victoria's expression shifted. She sneered dismissively. "That's far beyond what a little schemer like you deserves to know! Not that it matters now. Your father will crucify you when those test results come back! Cassandra and I will only gain more sympathy and affection from him!"

The ward door burst open with violent force. Vincent stormed in, face dark with fury. "It was all lies then, Victoria. Cassandra isn't my daughter at all!"

Victoria froze at the sight of her former lover. The color drained from her face. "Vincent? What are you doing here?"

Vincent's lip curled in disgust. "You texted me saying you were injured and wanted me to visit. I rushed here sick with worry!"

Victoria shook her head frantically. "I—I never— When did I— My phone— Where's my phone?" She patted her pockets in growing panic, realizing her cell was missing.

As her distress mounted, Evelyn stepped forward, holding out the device with feigned innocence. "You dropped it during the ambulance ride. I kept it safe for you. No thanks necessary."

Victoria's eyes widened in realization. "You! You're the one who texted Vincent!"

Evelyn's smile was deceptively sweet. "Think nothing of it."

"You little—" Victoria seethed.

Vincent cut in bitterly, "To think I believed your lies about secretly bearing my child all these years!"

Victoria scrambled to explain. "Vincent, listen— Cassandra is—"

The door swung open again as Cassandra and Gregory returned from giving DNA samples. Both froze at the unexpected scene.

Cassandra gasped. "Godfather? What are you doing here?"

Gregory's expression darkened as he glared at his wife. "Why is he here?"

Victoria swallowed hard, guilt flashing across her face. "He— Well— You see—"

Vincent, though furious, maintained his public persona. The practiced smile of a celebrity slid into place. "Mr. Gregory, isn't it? I came to check on my goddaughter's mother after hearing about her accident."

Gregory's hostility was palpable. "Unnecessary. My wife and daughter are my responsibility."

Vincent's smile turned icy. "Then I'll take my leave." He turned sharply toward the door.

Something in Vincent's demeanor unsettled Cassandra. Without hesitation, she hurried after him.
###Chapter 187

"Godfather, there was a small disagreement in our family today. My father isn't in the best mood, so his temper is a bit short. Please don't take it personally!"

Vincent halted, casting a disdainful glance at Cassandra. The warmth he once held for her was gone. "You're overthinking, Cassandra. Why would I be upset with your father? Go back to your parents. And stop calling me 'godfather.'"

Cassandra's breath hitched. "Are you... disowning me?"

Vincent's voice turned icy. "Our relationship was built on lies. This isn't about wanting you or not. Move aside. I have somewhere to be."

Everything Cassandra had carefully constructed was collapsing before her eyes. Desperation crept into her voice. "What about my role...?"

Vincent smirked. "I've seen your past work. Your acting is atrocious. I'd never cast someone like you. Go fool someone else."

Panic surged through her. She clutched at his sleeve. "You can't leave! You promised me that role! You can't just take it back!"

He shoved her away without mercy. "If your mother hadn't lied, claiming you were my secret daughter, I would never have offered it. I only did it out of guilt. Now that I know you're Gregory's blood, there's no reason to entertain you further."

Cassandra couldn't let him slip away. This role was her biggest break—her name was already splashed across social media. Being dropped now would humiliate her in the industry.

Her mind raced. A quick glance confirmed the hallway was empty. In a heartbeat, she dropped to her knees, gripping his pants. "But I am your daughter! My mother only said those things to calm her husband! We did a DNA test—don't you remember?"

Vincent stiffened, scanning the area. The last thing he needed was witnesses. "Get up! This is beneath you!"

Tears streamed down her face. "Not until you acknowledge me as your daughter!"

Exasperated, he relented. "Fine, fine. Get up, Cassandra. We'll discuss this—"

"Vincent!" A sharp voice sliced through the corridor.

He froze. Slowly, he turned, paling at the sight of his wife. "Natasha... What are you doing here?"

Natasha Blackwood stormed forward, jabbing a finger at him. "Oh, wonderful! A secret daughter, all grown up! How long were you planning to hide this?"

"It's not what you think! She's lying—"

Vincent's fear of his wife was legendary. His early career had thrived on her family's backing, and she controlled their finances. He'd never dared cross her.

Cassandra sensed disaster. She scrambled to her feet, ready to bolt.

"Don't you dare move, you little snake!" Natasha snarled.
###Chapter 188

Natasha Blackwood stormed toward Cassandra, her eyes narrowing at the younger woman's heavy makeup. Without warning, she delivered a stinging slap across Cassandra's face. "You shameless little tramp! How dare you grope my husband in public?"

Cassandra's usual haughty demeanor shattered instantly. She clutched her reddening cheek, stammering, "I... I didn't..."

A crowd began gathering at the commotion.

Vincent Blackwood panicked at the sight of potential paparazzi. He grabbed his wife's arm. "Darling, this is a hospital! Let's discuss this privately!"

Natasha jerked away violently. "Why should I care about privacy when you clearly don't care about fidelity?"

"Please, sweetheart—"

"Remember our prenup?" Natasha hissed. "One proven affair means immediate divorce with you walking away penniless. And now I find out you have a grown daughter?"

Vincent waved his hands frantically. "She's not my daughter! Just my goddaughter!"

Natasha shoved a DNA report in his face. "Explain this then!"

Vincent paled. It was the same test Victoria Blackwood had forced him and Cassandra to take.

"How... how did you get this?"

"Did you really think you could keep this secret forever?" Natasha spat. "Not only do you have an illegitimate child, but you made her your film's lead actress! Planning to replace me with her homewrecker mother?"

"Darling, I swear—"

Inside the nearby ward, Evelyn Whitmore leaned casually against the doorframe, watching the drama unfold. When the confrontation reached its peak, she turned back with feigned concern. "Dad, Aunt Victoria... Cassandra's in trouble. Some woman just slapped her and now she's sobbing hysterically."

"What?" Victoria's sickly pallor vanished as she bolted upright.

Gregory Whitmore initially showed concern, but his expression darkened when he noticed Victoria's suspiciously quick recovery.

Realizing her mistake, Victoria immediately clutched her forehead. "Gregory, help me up. We need to see who's attacking our daughter!"

"Easy now," Gregory said distractedly, helping her up without further suspicion.

In the hallway, Natasha had Cassandra by the hair while bystanders filmed the spectacle. Vincent stood helplessly to the side, covering his face.

"Release my daughter this instant!" Victoria shrieked as they arrived.

Gregory's face darkened at seeing Cassandra manhandled. "Assaulting someone in a hospital? Let her go or I'm calling the police!"

Cassandra wept dramatically. "Mom! Dad! Help me!"

Natasha whirled toward Victoria. "So you're the whore who spawned this bastard?"

Victoria flinched. "How dare you—"

"I'm Natasha Blackwood! You homewrecking slut! You have your own husband yet you seduced mine?"

Victoria's confidence evaporated. She forced a smile. "Mrs. Blackwood! This is all a misunderstanding! Let's discuss this privately—"

"Misunderstanding?" Natasha threw the DNA report at her. "This proves your daughter is my husband's child! How dare you lie to my face?"

Gregory snatched the document. His face turned ashen. "Victoria... what the hell is this?"

Victoria ignored him, pleading with Natasha. "No, no! My daughter is Gregory's child! Please, you're mistaken!"

Natasha scoffed. "The test results don't lie. You're both disgusting!"
###Chapter 189

Victoria knew Natasha Blackwood wasn't someone to be trifled with. If she truly believed Cassandra was Vincent's daughter, Cassandra's life would be over.

Swallowing her pride, Victoria confessed. "I'm sorry. The test was forged. I wanted my daughter to gain Vincent's favor. They're not related by blood—I paid someone to fake the results. You can verify with the agency if you don't believe me."

Vincent's face twisted in disgust. "Victoria, you're utterly—"

Gregory's expression mirrored his. "Victoria, you're completely—"

The two men spoke simultaneously, their voices dripping with contempt.

Natasha studied Victoria, weighing her words. The explanation made sense—too much sense. Seeing her hesitation, Vincent seized the moment to guide her away.

Humiliated, Gregory released Victoria and turned to leave.

"Gregory! Where are you going?" Victoria clutched at his sleeve in panic.

He shook her off. "I can't stand being near either of you anymore. Expect divorce papers tomorrow."

The word divorce struck Victoria like a physical blow. He had never threatened that before.

Just then, a nurse approached. "The expedited paternity results are ready."

Victoria snatched the report, scanned it, and thrust it at Gregory. "Look! The results prove you're Cassandra's father! You can't leave us!"

Gregory didn't even glance at it. "How do I know this isn't another forgery?"

"Gregory! Please!" Her pleas fell on deaf ears as he walked away without looking back.

Cassandra, her hair tangled from Natasha's earlier assault, collapsed to the floor. "What now, Mother? My godfather hates me, and Father wants to divorce you. We're ruined!"

Victoria dropped to her knees beside her, tears streaming. "There has to be a way. I won't let him leave us!"

From a distance, Evelyn watched the scene unfold, a faint smirk playing on her lips.

"Watching them suffer is so satisfying," Sebastian murmured beside her.

Evelyn turned, stretching her stiff back. The soreness reminded her of last night's activities with a certain someone, and warmth crept up her cheeks. She rubbed her temples, recalling how she'd instructed Sebastian to send the forged test results to Natasha via express delivery. The woman had flown into a rage and stormed back immediately.

Following Evelyn's plan, Sebastian had led Natasha straight to the hospital—with spectacular results.

As they walked away, Sebastian hesitated. "Boss, I found something about you."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Oh?"

He handed her a report, his expression uneasy. "Gregory's behavior toward you never felt... fatherly. So I ran a DNA test with a sample of your hair." He exhaled. "You're not his biological daughter."

Evelyn froze, staring at the document. If Gregory isn't my father... then who is?
###Chapter 190

Evelyn and Victoria returned to the hospital room to collect their things, eager to get home and smooth things over with Gregory.

The moment they stepped inside, they found Evelyn lounging lazily in a chair, eyes shut, clearly enjoying a peaceful nap.

The sight alone was enough to ignite fury in the already desperate mother and daughter.

Cassandra lunged forward, hand raised to shove Evelyn awake—but Evelyn caught her wrist mid-motion, grip tightening as her eyes fluttered open.

"Why sneak in just to attack me?" Evelyn asked, voice thick with sleep.

Cassandra yanked her arm back with a scowl. "This is all your fault, Evelyn."

Victoria nodded bitterly. "She definitely orchestrated everything!"

Evelyn tilted her head, feigning confusion. "How? Everything that happened today was your own doing, wasn’t it?"

Cassandra clenched her teeth, ready to strike—when two sharp knocks interrupted.

Both women turned to see Sebastian Monroe, Newmoon Group’s vice president, standing in the doorway, one hand still raised from knocking.

Cassandra’s expression shifted instantly into a polite smile. "Mister Sebastian! What brings you here?"

A cold smirk played on Sebastian’s lips. "Your assistant told me you were here."

Cassandra’s mind raced. My assistant? Evelyn? Then she remembered—Sebastian had once confessed his feelings for Evelyn at first sight.

Her jealousy flared as she asked carefully, "So, you’re here for...?"

Sebastian finished for her. "You, Miss Cassandra. I’m here for you."

Relief washed over Cassandra, and she shot Evelyn a smug look. "This must be about the endorsement deal. Don’t worry, Mister Sebastian, I’ll cooperate fully!"

Sebastian stepped forward, handing her a document. "Good. This is the termination agreement for your contract. Sign here."

Cassandra’s smile froze. "Termination? But we just signed yesterday!"

"Have you checked the trending news? Your scandals are everywhere. Our contract clearly states we can terminate if the endorser’s reputation is compromised."

Scandals? Cassandra scrambled for her phone, face paling as she saw the hashtags:

#CassandraTheHomewrecker
#CassandraBlackwoodExposed

The videos showed blurred faces, but it was unmistakable—Vincent Blackwood had protected himself and his wife, leaving Cassandra to drown in the backlash.
###Chapter 191

The reality was starkly different from what the trending searches suggested.

Cassandra seethed with rage. She was accustomed to manipulating public opinion against others, not being the target herself. The injustice of it burned through her.

"Mister Sebastian, those headlines are lies! You have to believe me—" she pleaded desperately.

Sebastian remained impassive. "The issue isn't whether I believe you, Miss Cassandra. It's whether the public does. If you refuse to terminate the contract amicably, we can proceed legally. But I should warn you—the compensation for losing would be far more substantial."

Cassandra clenched her fists. She knew she stood no chance against Newmoon Group in court. Defeated, she relented. "Fine. I'll sign."

Just like that, the contract was dissolved.

Victoria watched from the sidelines, her heart aching for her daughter. Cassandra's downfall was brutal—losing both the lead role in Vincent's film and the Newmoon ambassadorship would make a comeback nearly impossible.

Sebastian accepted the signed agreement with a satisfied nod, then glanced subtly at Evelyn, who returned the slightest tilt of her head. Understanding the silent cue, he turned and left.

Humiliated and powerless against those she couldn't challenge, Cassandra redirected her fury toward Evelyn.

"Evelyn, you're fired. Return my advance—now."

Evelyn couldn't hide her relief. "Gladly."

She pulled out her phone to transfer the funds, but Cassandra scowled at the amount. "Why only seven hundred fifty? I paid you fifteen hundred!"

Evelyn shrugged. "Given the unreasonable workload, consider yourself lucky I'm returning half."

Cassandra scoffed. "You worked barely a week and think you deserve that much? Delusional."

A faint smirk played on Evelyn's lips. "I may not be famous, but my services don't come cheap. Think of it as a sisterly discount."

Cassandra's laugh was sharp. "An assistant isn't some elite position. For what I paid you, I could hire three people!"

"Really?" Evelyn tilted her head. "With your current reputation, good luck finding anyone willing to work for you."

Cassandra's face twisted. "How dare you—"

Victoria intervened, pulling her daughter back. "Enough. Let's go home. We'll deal with her another time."

Evelyn yawned, stretching lazily before strolling out of the ward without another glance.

While waiting for the elevator, she donated the $750 to charity.

She needed money, but not Cassandra's. This was purely about making her pay for those miserable days of servitude.

A lesson. One Cassandra wouldn't forget.

The elevator doors slid open, revealing Lucas. He bowed slightly. "Ma'am, I'm here to escort you."
###Chapter 192

Evelyn's brows knitted together at the sight of Lucas. "How does he know I'm at the hospital?"

Nathaniel had clearly arranged for her to stay with the Whitmores that morning. Had he put someone on her tail?

Lucas offered a quick explanation. "You're using his phone. The GPS tracker gives away your location."

"I see." Evelyn glanced down at the device in her hand, a prickle of unease creeping up her spine at the thought of being monitored.

He continued, "He knew you called an ambulance but couldn't leave an urgent board meeting. Sent me to check on you instead."

"Just my stepmother got hurt. I'm fine."

"Glad to hear that, Mrs. Grayson."

The formal address made Evelyn stiffen. He'd always called her 'Miss Evelyn' before. When had that changed?

She pushed the thought aside. "Did Nathaniel say where to take me?"

"Just home safely." Lucas's tone suggested last night's kidnapping had left Nathaniel on high alert.

"Let's go then." Evelyn seized the chance to skip the taxi fare. Exhaustion weighed on her, and all she wanted was her bed.

As the car moved, Evelyn propped her chin on her hand, staring blankly at the blur of buildings outside. Her thoughts churned. Sebastian discovering Gregory wasn't her father had upended everything.

If I'm not a Whitmore, then what's my real name? Who's my biological father? Why abandon us? Why would Gregory take in someone else's child? He never wanted me—shipped me off to the countryside like unwanted luggage.

The questions formed an unsolvable riddle in her mind.

By the time they reached the Grayson estate, Evelyn had dozed off.

"Mrs. Grayson?" Lucas's gentle nudge roused her. "We're here."

She blinked sleepily, verified the familiar gates, then unbuckled her seatbelt.

"Wait!" Lucas hurried out and popped the trunk. "Mr. Grayson left something for you."

Evelyn's curiosity piqued. She approached to find three ornate picture frames—her mother's lost paintings from Christopher's collection.

"Nathaniel purchased these for you. Are they the ones you wanted?"

Evelyn's breath caught. "Yes! But how? Christopher said they weren't for sale."

"The Ashfords rely heavily on Grayson business partnerships." Lucas shrugged. "Some favors get prioritized."

Evelyn traced the gilded edges, emotions swelling. The brushstrokes felt like her mother's touch across time.

So this is what he meant by not treating me poorly.
###Chapter 193

A little give-and-take never hurt anyone, and Evelyn was more than pleased to receive the paintings she had been eyeing.

"Tell your boss I said thanks!"

She pressed the doorbell and waited for the butler to send someone out to help carry the three canvases inside.

Lucas's phone buzzed with a message. He glanced down, then back at Evelyn. "Ma'am, Mr. Grayson would like to know if you have any dinner preferences for tonight."

Evelyn blinked. "He's coming home for dinner?"

Lucas nodded. "It appears so."

Her frown deepened. Why now, when Margaret wasn’t hovering over them anymore?

"Anything’s fine. I’m not picky."

"Understood." Lucas waited until Evelyn was safely inside before driving off, following Nathaniel’s instructions.

Meanwhile, at Grayson Group, Nathaniel leaned back in his chair, massaging his temples after a grueling meeting.

His secretary knocked lightly. "Sir, Mr. Benjamin Rivers has been waiting in the reception area for nearly an hour."

Nathaniel barely looked up. "Send him in."

Moments later, Benjamin strode into the office, his expression tense as he studied Nathaniel. "Are you okay? What happened last night?"

Nathaniel flipped through a file, raising a brow. "Did you expect something to happen to me?"

Benjamin scowled. "How should I know? Evelyn called me from your phone, saying you needed my sister’s help. I told her Amelia’s abroad, and she hung up before I could ask anything else. What did you need Amelia for?"

The memory of Evelyn’s relentless attempts to find him a woman last night soured Nathaniel’s expression. "How does she even know about Amelia?"

Benjamin rolled his eyes. "I told her. I made it clear she shouldn’t get any ideas about you—you’re meant for my sister."

Nathaniel’s gaze turned icy. "Don’t spout nonsense in front of her again."

Benjamin crossed his arms. "It’s not nonsense! Amelia’s been waiting for you all this time. You and her—"

"Hey, Ben! Didn’t expect to see you here! On summer break already? Perfect timing—we’re heading out for some fun!" Dominic strolled in, cutting Benjamin off mid-sentence.

The mention of fun instantly brightened Benjamin’s mood, his earlier frustration forgotten. "Where are we going?"

Dominic grinned. "Silver Peaks Ranch. It’s been ages since I visited. My little Stardust must be missing me. The weather’s perfect for a two-day trip."

Benjamin’s eyes lit up. "Horseback riding? I’m in!"

Dominic turned to Nathaniel. "You coming?"

Nathaniel didn’t look up from his documents. "No time."

Dominic scoffed. "It’s the weekend. The office can survive without you for two days. Bring Evelyn too. Since you skipped the honeymoon, this is your chance to actually spend time with her."
###Chapter 194

"I won't last long anyway, so there's no need for a honeymoon! He'll be going on a honeymoon with my sister in the future, regardless."

"You don't get it at all!" Dominic smirked, raising an eyebrow at his brooding friend seated in the office chair. "So. Are you going, Nathaniel?"

Nathaniel flipped another page of the document, eyes scanning the text as he replied, "She's exhausted today. We won't be heading over. I'll bring her with me to meet you all early tomorrow morning."

Dominic snapped his fingers. "Then it's settled!"

With that, he slid his hands into his pockets and turned to leave.

When he noticed Benjamin still standing there, Dominic paused and clapped the younger man on the shoulder. "What are you still doing here, Ben? Come with me to the ranch!"

Benjamin was eager but hesitated, frustration flickering across his face. "Could you call my brother and talk to him? I'm worried he won't let me go."

Dominic chuckled. "How old are you? Still scared of your brother?"

Benjamin sighed. "You know Samuel! He's ruthless—way stricter than our father ever was."

"Fine, I'll call him and put in a good word for you."

"Thanks, Dom! If you convince him to let me go riding, I'll treat you to a whole roasted lamb at the ranch!"

Later that evening at the Grayson estate, Evelyn woke up starving after sleeping through the afternoon. She headed to the kitchen to whip up some instant mac and cheese.

Though the household had plenty of servants, only Theodore showed her any respect. The rest, siding with Abigail, treated her with open hostility.

Most ignored the young woman Nathaniel had hastily married—especially since he rarely came home after their wedding.

So when Margaret left, none of the servants bothered to prepare dinner for Evelyn unless Nathaniel returned.

Not that she cared. She never considered herself part of the Grayson family anyway. Growing up fending for herself, she had no problem cooking when hunger struck.

When Nathaniel walked in, he found her alone in the kitchen—no servants, no butler in sight. His expression darkened slightly as he approached. "What are you doing?"

Evelyn, grating cheese, startled at his voice. She turned, flashing him a quick smile. "Mister Grayson! You're back. I'm making mac and cheese. Want some?"

She wore a snug apron, the bow tied tightly at her back, accentuating her slender waist.

Nathaniel's gaze lingered, throat tightening. He glanced at the ingredients on the counter and nodded. "I don't mind trying it."

She'd expected a disgusted refusal. Surprised, she suppressed a smirk. "Then wait in the dining room. It'll be ready in ten minutes."

Instead of leaving, he set down his belongings, shrugged off his suit jacket, and tossed it onto the sofa before returning.

Rolling up his sleeves with deliberate slowness, he asked flatly, "Need any help?"

Evelyn blinked. A pampered CEO offering to cook? After a beat, she gestured. "How about dicing two strips of bacon into thin pieces?"

He grunted. "Where's the bacon?"

Her lips twitched. "Isn't this your house? You don't know where the bacon is?"

Nathaniel arched a brow. "Do I look like someone who inventories the kitchen in my free time?"

Evelyn snorted. "Second drawer from the bottom in the fridge."
###Chapter 195

Nathaniel's expression remained impassive as he turned toward the refrigerator to retrieve the bacon.

Inside the kitchen, the two worked in silence, each occupied with their tasks. Nathaniel's gaze lingered on Evelyn as he chopped the bacon, his movements precise.

The mac and cheese, topped with crispy bacon, was ready in minutes. Evelyn wiped her hands and glanced at Nathaniel. "You can take the bowls to the table. I’ll be right back."

Without protest, Nathaniel picked up both bowls and walked out.

Just then, Theodore, the butler, stepped inside, his eyes widening in alarm at the sight of Nathaniel carrying the dishes. He scanned the room, realizing the servants had vanished—likely slacking off in their master’s absence.

"Sir! When did you return? Please, let me handle this! You shouldn’t be doing such tasks!"

Nathaniel ignored Theodore’s outstretched hands, setting the bowls on the table before pulling out a chair. His voice was low, dangerous. "So I shouldn’t, but my wife can?"

Theodore stiffened, guilt flashing across his face. "My deepest apologies, sir. I was tending to your grandfather’s orchids and didn’t realize Madam Evelyn had woken. The staff… they’ve been resentful since the incident with Miss Abigail."

Nathaniel adjusted his cuffs, his tone icy. "If they’re unhappy, I’ll replace them with those who aren’t."

Theodore swallowed hard, recognizing the steel beneath Nathaniel’s calm. There would be no leniency.

Evelyn returned from the bathroom, spotting Theodore. "Would you like some mac and cheese? There’s plenty left."

Theodore shook his head hastily. "Thank you, but I’m not hungry. I—I have duties to attend to. Please, enjoy your meal."

With that, he hurried off, intent on reprimanding the negligent staff.

Evelyn sat down, her eyes landing on a takeout box of barbecue—her favorite from that little roadside stall. She blinked in surprise.

"Did you get this?"

Nathaniel didn’t look up. "Lucas picked it up on his way."

She didn’t question it, reaching for a skewer.

Nathaniel arched a brow. "Did I say you could eat that?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "You’re eating my mac and cheese. I’m eating your barbecue. Fair trade."

A faint smirk tugged at Nathaniel’s lips as he took a bite of the mac and cheese. It was surprisingly good.

"Did you go to the hospital today?" he asked abruptly.

Evelyn nodded, chewing. "Yeah, my stepmother got hurt. Lucas must’ve told you."

Nathaniel’s gaze sharpened. "Did you get checked?"

She frowned. "Why? I’m fine."

He swirled his fork in the bowl. "Last night was your first time. You should’ve made sure I didn’t hurt you."

Evelyn choked, her face burning. "Ack—cough—what?!"
###Chapter 196

Nathaniel pulled out a tissue and handed it to Evelyn. He sighed, shaking his head like a disapproving parent. "Slow down. The food isn't going anywhere."

Evelyn struggled to chew and swallow the meat in her mouth. She took the tissue, wiped her lips, and turned her face away, too embarrassed to meet his gaze. "Mister, can we please stop talking about last night?"

"Why?" Nathaniel arched a brow, amusement dancing in his eyes. "Is Miss Evelyn feeling shy?"

Her lips pressed into a thin line. "I'm not shy! I just don't want to remember it!"

Unbearable to remember?

His expression darkened for a brief moment before he smirked. "Oh, come on. You sacrificed yourself to save a life—that's noble. Shouldn't it be a memorable experience?"

The words were so blunt Evelyn's cheeks burned crimson. Her eyes darted away, fingers tightening around her chopsticks.

He's mocking me! The nerve! I wouldn’t have done it if he wasn’t dying!

The heat spread to her ears, and she suddenly lost her appetite.

Nathaniel chuckled, relenting. "Fine, I’ll stop. But tell me—do you have plans tomorrow?"

Evelyn finally dared to look at him again. "No. Why?"

"Good. You're coming with me to Silver Peaks Ranch."

She frowned. "Do I have to?"

His gaze sharpened. "Do you have something better to do?"

"Not really, but I’d rather stay home."

His tone left no room for argument. "You’re coming. Staying in bed all day isn’t healthy."

Ugh. He’s not asking—he’s ordering. She exhaled sharply. "Is this another performance for the contract?"

Nathaniel’s eyes narrowed. "Is that all you think about?"

Evelyn stabbed at her noodles. "Then why else would you drag me along? Or is this supposed to be a date?"

Date?

He sipped his water, unfazed. "Considering what we’ve already done, wouldn’t that make sense?"

She choked. "Again with that?!"

Her face flamed anew, hotter than before.

Nathaniel reached over, patting her back as she coughed. "Relax. I’ll stop. Just be ready early tomorrow. We’re going out."

Going out? For fun? She stared at him like he’d grown a second head. Since when does he care about fun?

"Fine," she muttered, shoveling noodles into her mouth to avoid further conversation.

Once finished, she bolted to her room.

Nathaniel worked in his study until late. When he finally returned to rest, the bedroom door was locked.

His jaw clenched. That little—

He could easily get the key from Theodore. But after a moment’s thought, he smirked and walked away.
###Chapter 197

Nathaniel assumed Evelyn was still asleep. Disturbing her rest seemed unnecessary.

He rubbed his temples and retreated to the study with a dark expression.

Morning came too soon.

Evelyn woke early, washed up quickly, and dressed in a haze. She descended the stairs moments before Nathaniel, both stepping into the crisp morning air.

The car ride passed in silence. Evelyn leaned against the window, dozing off almost immediately. Conversation between them felt pointless anyway.

Two hours later, they arrived at Silver Peaks Ranch.

The car door barely opened before a whirlwind of energy came barreling toward her.

"Eve-lyn!"

Sophia Bennett's enthusiastic tackle shook off any remaining drowsiness. "I missed you so much! It's been forever!"

Evelyn chuckled at the dramatic greeting. "Not that long, but I missed you too."

Sophia clung to her like a koala until Nathaniel's sharp voice cut through. "Get off her. You're crushing her."

The girl immediately released her grip, pouting at her uncle's sternness.

Nathaniel ignored her sulking expression. "Why are you here? Who brought you?"

Sophia brightened instantly. "I saw Dominic's vacation posts! Remembering my pony lives here, I decided to crash your party!"

His brows furrowed. "Does your mother know you're here?"

Sophia suddenly found the ground fascinating. Changing tactics, she turned back to Evelyn. "You look exhausted! Didn't sleep well?"

Evelyn nodded. "Woke up too early."

Sophia shot Nathaniel an accusatory glare. "You should've let her sleep in if you knew we had plans today!"

Both adults froze. Had the teenager just imagined something scandalous?

"Come ride with me! It'll wake you up!" Sophia grabbed Evelyn's hand, dragging her toward the stables before either could respond.

Nathaniel sighed, following at a more dignified pace.

At the outdoor lounge area, Gabrielle Winslow sat with Dominic Prescott, Harrison Ford, Benjamin Rivers, and Jonathan Blake. Gabrielle wore impeccable riding attire, her wavy hair secured in a sleek ponytail.

Sophia's excited shouts announced their arrival. "They're here! Uncle Nathaniel and Evelyn!"

The group turned as one. Evelyn approached with Sophia while Nathaniel maintained his usual measured stride.

Jonathan smiled warmly at Evelyn.

Gabrielle's critical gaze swept over Evelyn's simple t-shirt and jeans. The contrast to her own designer equestrian wear made her lips curl slightly. Clearly Nathaniel didn't care enough to dress his companion properly.

Benjamin's eyes lit up at Evelyn's approach, though something troubled flickered across his expression.

Dominic stood with a grin. "You missed Benjamin's legendary BBQ last night."

Nathaniel positioned himself beside Evelyn naturally. "Not too late for a repeat performance today."
###Chapter 198

Nathaniel's gaze flickered to Benjamin with amusement. "Ben, did you catch that? Evelyn's offering to treat us all tonight."

Benjamin had been staring so intently at Evelyn that he jumped at Nathaniel's voice.

Flushing, he stammered, "Uh...my brother froze my accounts after last night's dinner. I'm completely broke."

Nathaniel shrugged casually. "No matter. She's paying tonight anyway."

She?

Evelyn's eyes widened when she realized he meant her. Her cheeks puffed out in indignation.

What nonsense! Why should she pay for strangers? Nathaniel had dragged her here against her will!

All eyes turned expectantly toward Evelyn.

She crossed her arms stubbornly. "Absolutely not—"

Nathaniel pulled her close before she could finish, his warm breath tickling her ear. "Miss Whitmore, you're holding my wallet. You know the PIN. My money, your generosity. Understood?"

Instantly, her frown transformed into a radiant smile. "Of course! Dinner's on me tonight!"

Dominic chuckled. "In that case, we won't hold back!"

Evelyn waved a careless hand. "Order whatever you like! Let's see if we can bankrupt me completely!"

Dominic rubbed his hands together gleefully. "You heard the lady! Lobster and champagne for everyone!"

Nathaniel studied Evelyn's triumphant expression with amusement. This little minx had done a complete one-eighty the moment she realized his wallet was involved.

"Miss Whitmore," he murmured, "don't you think you're being rather shameless, spending my money so freely?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "If you're going to treat people, do it properly. Don't be such a cheapskate."

Cheapskate?

Nathaniel arched an eyebrow. "If you're so generous, why not use your own funds?"

Evelyn smirked. "My money doesn't grow on trees. I'd rather spend it on things that matter—not feeding random strangers. Besides," she added without thinking, "I've already slept with you. Should I be paying you?"

Her face instantly burned crimson. Damn her runaway mouth!

Nathaniel froze for a heartbeat before bursting into laughter. He ruffled her hair affectionately. "Point taken, Miss Whitmore. Keep your money. Mine is yours to spend as you please."

Evelyn exhaled in relief—both at avoiding further embarrassment and successfully conning Nathaniel. Grinning, she declared, "Don't worry, I won't hesitate to drain your accounts dry!"

Nathaniel's lips quirked as he watched her triumphant expression.

Across the room, Gabrielle's nails dug into her palms as she observed the intimate exchange. She'd never seen Nathaniel lower himself to whisper in any woman's ear before. This wasn't the cold, detached man she knew.

An idea sparked in her mind.

Forcing a bright smile, she approached them. "Evelyn! First time riding?"

Evelyn regarded Gabrielle coolly, remembering their unpleasant watch encounter. "No, I've ridden before."

Gabrielle's smile didn't reach her eyes. "How wonderful! Then we must race later!"

Internally, she scoffed. There was no way this country bumpkin had ever touched a horse.
###Chapter 199

Sophia Bennett bounced on her toes impatiently before grabbing Evelyn Whitmore's arm. "Come on, Evelyn! Let's get you changed into proper riding gear!"

"Riding gear?" Evelyn arched one perfect eyebrow. "I didn't pack any."

Sophia's eyes widened. "Seriously? I brought an extra set you can borrow! Though..." She bit her lip. "I don't have spare boots."

Gabrielle Winslow stepped forward with a gentle smile. "I've got an extra pair. Not sure if they'll fit though."

"Size five and a half," Evelyn offered.

Gabrielle winced. "Mine are sevens. Might be roomy, but worth a try?"

Evelyn nodded. "Appreciate it."

"Don't mention it!" Gabrielle's smile brightened. "What are friends for?"

The trio headed toward the changing rooms.

Inside the dressing area—

The borrowed riding suit clung to Evelyn's curves like it was made for her. The deep crimson fabric accentuated every dip and swell of her figure. With her dark hair swept up in a careless bun, the outfit transformed her usual casual elegance into something downright regal.

Sophia gasped. "Holy hell, Evelyn! You look like you stepped out of a Ralph Lauren ad!"

Evelyn tugged at the sleeves. "It's just the clothes."

"Are you kidding?" Sophia fanned herself dramatically. "If I swung that way, I'd kidnap you from Uncle Nathaniel in a heartbeat!"

Evelyn's lips parted in silent shock.

Gabrielle chose that moment to return with the boots. "Here, try these—" Her words died as she took in Evelyn's transformation. The usually poised woman actually stumbled mid-step.

Every woman knew that particular sting—when another female's beauty didn't just impress but actually hurt to look at. Gabrielle's grip tightened on the boots.

Evelyn reached for them. "Thanks, but..." She slid one foot in and immediately sank. "Way too big."

Gabrielle forced a laugh. "Guess sneakers it is!"

As Evelyn and Sophia left, Gabrielle claimed she needed the restroom. "Don't wait up," she called after them.

Outside, Nathaniel Grayson lounged under a striped umbrella with Dominic Prescott and their group. Dominic spotted Evelyn first, his drink freezing halfway to his lips. He elbowed Nathaniel sharply.

Nathaniel glanced up—and felt the air punch from his lungs.

Sunlight gilded Evelyn's silhouette as she moved. The riding habit transformed her—where casual clothes softened her edges, this outfit carved her into something lethally elegant. She'd always been beautiful, but this? This was weaponized beauty.

Then a bloodcurdling scream shattered the moment.
###Chapter 200

A piercing scream shattered the peaceful atmosphere.

Gasps echoed through the crowd.

"What was that?" someone cried out.

"Something's wrong in the dressing area!"

"That sounded like Gabrielle!"

Evelyn and Sophia Bennett exchanged startled glances. Their confused expressions mirrored each other perfectly. Just moments ago when they'd left, Gabrielle had seemed completely fine.

The entire group rushed toward the source of the disturbance.

Inside the dressing room, Gabrielle sat hunched on the bench, face contorted in pain. Beads of sweat dotted her forehead as her complexion turned ghostly pale. The agony radiating from her was palpable.

Benjamin was the first to reach her. "Gabrielle, what happened?"

Dominic Prescott stepped forward, voice laced with concern. "Are you hurt?"

Gabrielle lifted tear-filled eyes. "My... my foot..."

All eyes dropped to her outstretched leg.

Only one boot remained on her feet. Her bare foot trembled visibly as she fought against the pain.

"I was changing boots because my feet were sweating," she gasped. "Something inside... stabbed me. It hurts so much..."

Benjamin immediately knelt to examine the injury. "There's something embedded in her foot. Looks like... a nail?" He glanced up urgently. "We need help!"

Dominic's demeanor shifted instantly into command mode. "Silver Peaks Ranch has medical staff on standby. I'll have them summoned immediately."

"Hold on just a little longer," Benjamin reassured Gabrielle, watching as tears spilled down her cheeks.

Meanwhile, Sophia tugged Evelyn aside. "That's the same pair of boots you tried on earlier," she whispered. "How did a nail get in there?"

Evelyn's gaze remained fixed on Gabrielle, her eyes narrowing thoughtfully.

The doctor arrived with impressive speed. After quick assessment, he produced forceps from his medical kit and expertly removed the offending object. Antiseptic was applied before careful bandaging.

Throughout the procedure, Gabrielle clung to Benjamin's arm, her grip tightening with each wave of pain. Tears streaked her makeup as she whimpered softly.

"The object has been removed," the doctor announced. "Avoid getting the wound wet to prevent infection."

Gabrielle looked utterly drained. "Benjamin," she whispered weakly, "please ask for pain medication. The throbbing won't stop."

Benjamin's expression darkened with anger. "What kind of establishment allows dangerous objects in customer footwear?" he demanded.

The doctor held up the extracted item. "Actually, this isn't a nail. It's an earring stud. And since we employ no female staff at Silver Peaks, this clearly doesn't belong to us."

The diamond stud glittered in his palm - undeniable evidence of someone's carelessness... or perhaps something more intentional.
###Chapter 201

Benjamin stared at the ear stud, his anger dissolving instantly. He sighed, turning back to Gabrielle.

"Gabrielle, I think you dropped your ear stud into the boot. You should be more careful next time."

Gabrielle glanced at the stud in the doctor's palm and shook her head. "No, that's not mine. I don’t wear this kind."

Benjamin's expression sharpened. "So this isn’t yours? Someone put it in your boot? Is someone here trying to hurt you?"

The room tensed. These people had grown up together—their families intertwined for years. None would resort to something so petty.

Gabrielle froze, then realization flickered across her face. Her gaze snapped to Evelyn, who stood between Nathaniel and Sophia.

"Evelyn, I never did anything to you. Why would you do this?" Her voice trembled.

Shock rippled through the group. All eyes turned to Evelyn—the outsider, the stranger among them.

Evelyn, stifling a yawn, blinked lazily at Gabrielle. "Huh? Me?"

Gabrielle's eyes burned. Evelyn's indifference stung. "You were the only one who touched my boots when I let you try them. Who else could it be?"

Her voice cracked. "I was kind enough to lend them to you, even though they didn’t fit. Was that worth hurting me over? Do you know what this could do to my career? I’m a dancer!"

Evelyn arched a brow. "I had nothing to do with that ear stud. You’re not made of glass. A tiny stud won’t shatter you."

Gabrielle bit her lip, tears welling. "You wouldn’t understand the pain because it didn’t happen to you!"

She swallowed hard. "I know we had that issue with the watch, but that’s over, isn’t it? Was revenge really necessary?"

Evelyn frowned like she’d heard a bad joke. "Revenge? Gabrielle, are you delusional?"

She shrugged. "When I tossed your watch into the soup, I considered us even. I don’t waste time dwelling on petty grudges."

Gabrielle stiffened. She hadn’t expected such bluntness. But it worked in her favor—the ruder Evelyn acted, the more the others would side with her.

Forcing a smile, Gabrielle exhaled. "Evelyn, you don’t have to lie. I’m not asking for compensation. Just admit it, and we can move on. For Nathaniel’s sake, we could even be friends."

Evelyn’s expression turned icy. "We were never friends, and we never will be. And I don’t admit to things I didn’t do."

Perfect. Gabrielle had never wanted friendship—only to paint herself as the victim.

Tears shimmering, she turned to Nathaniel, who had remained silent. "Nathaniel, you’ve known me for years. Do you really think I’d accuse her without reason?"
###Chapter 202

Gabrielle's hopeful gaze locked onto Nathaniel, silently begging him to stand with her against Evelyn.

Dominic and the others watched Nathaniel intently, curious how he'd navigate this conflict between his wife and longtime friend.

His face remained an unreadable mask. "I know you wouldn't accuse someone without cause," he finally said in that deep, commanding voice.

The statement clearly placed Nathaniel in Gabrielle's corner.

Evelyn's heart sank. She lowered her head, lips twisting into a bitter smile. Of course no one would take her side. Why would they?

After everything she and Nathaniel had been through together - the dangerous missions, the intimate nights - he'd chosen Gabrielle without hesitation.

That stung more than she cared to admit.

Trust truly was the rarest commodity in this world.

The room's occupants studied Evelyn with varying expressions - some doubtful, others already convinced of her guilt.

Gabrielle allowed herself a fleeting moment of triumph before resuming her wounded expression. "Thank you for believing me, Nathaniel. I don't know how I'd bear this injustice otherwise."

Sophia Bennett suddenly pushed forward. "You're wrong, Uncle Nathaniel! I believe Evelyn!"

The young girl turned fiercely toward Gabrielle. "You can't make accusations without proof! I watched the whole time Evelyn tried on those boots - she never put anything in them!"

Gabrielle sighed dramatically. "Sweetheart, criminals don't commit crimes in plain sight. Evelyn was the only one who touched my boots before the ear stud appeared. The facts speak for themselves."

"That's ridiculous!" Sophia countered. "Evelyn wasn't even wearing ear studs today! Maybe you planted it yourself!"

A wounded expression crossed Gabrielle's face. "Why would I hurt myself? That makes no sense."

Sophia rolled her eyes. "Like when you and Benjamin blamed Evelyn for your missing watch without evidence?"

Benjamin opened his mouth to protest but thought better of it.

Recognizing she couldn't win against Nathaniel's niece, Gabrielle turned back to him with a conciliatory smile. "Let's not fight. All I want is an apology from Evelyn, and we can move past this."

Sophia bristled. "Evelyn shouldn't-"

Nathaniel's large hand settled on his niece's shoulder, silencing her.

He stepped forward, his icy gaze pinning Gabrielle. "You want justice? Then who will deliver justice for my wife?"

Gabrielle paled. "Nathaniel... you can't possibly suspect me?"

"I suspect no one," Nathaniel said coolly, his authority radiating through the room. "But I know my wife. She doesn't harm others without cause."
###Chapter 203

Evelyn's eyes widened in shock as she stared at Nathaniel. 'He actually believes me?'

Gabrielle's face twisted in confusion. "But Nathaniel, didn't you say you trusted I wouldn't frame Evelyn without cause? Why are you saying this now?"

Nathaniel's expression remained impassive. "Exactly. I believe you wouldn't do it without reason. So tell us - what's your reason for targeting my wife?"

The realization hit Evelyn like a thunderbolt. Nathaniel wasn't taking Gabrielle's side at all. His question implied he knew Gabrielle had staged the whole incident.

Panic flashed across Gabrielle's face as she played the victim card. "Nathaniel! We've been friends for years! How could you doubt me like this?"

Nathaniel remained unmoved. "Time doesn't determine truth. I may have only known Evelyn for a short while, but we trust each other completely. No outside interference can shake that."

Gabrielle looked like she'd been slapped. Her eyes welled up with bitter tears. "Interference? Is that what you think I'm doing? After all our years of friendship?"

Nathaniel's patience visibly wore thin. "Gabrielle, either explain yourself or stop accusing my wife. Otherwise, I'll see you in court."

He turned to Evelyn with unexpected gentleness. "Hungry?"

Evelyn blinked, pulled from her daze. "A little."

"Let's get breakfast then." Without hesitation, Nathaniel took her hand and led her out of the changing room, ignoring the stunned onlookers.

Sophia Bennett hurried after them, grinning. "Uncle Nathaniel! You had me worried there for a second! I thought you didn't believe Evelyn!"

Nathaniel arched an eyebrow. "So I'm not the villain anymore?"

Sophia laughed. "Never! I should've known better. Your bond with Evelyn is unshakable!"

Evelyn nearly choked. 'Unshakable bond? Since when?'

As Nathaniel and Evelyn departed, Dominic Prescott and the others prepared to leave too, having remained neutral observers throughout the confrontation.

But Gabrielle stood frozen, watching the retreating couple with burning rage. Nathaniel had threatened legal action over that country girl Evelyn!

If he'd already made up his mind, she wouldn't let Evelyn walk away unscathed.

Clenching her fists, Gabrielle suddenly called out, "Nathaniel, wait!"

He paused, glancing back coolly. "What now?"

Face dark with anger, Gabrielle declared, "If you leave now, everyone will think I framed her! I won't have my reputation tarnished like this!"

"Then what do you propose?" Nathaniel asked icily.

"If you truly believe her innocence, let Evelyn prove this earring isn't hers!"
###Chapter 204

Nathaniel responded immediately, "She doesn't owe you any proof."

Gabrielle's eyes widened in disbelief. "Nathaniel, have you lost your mind? This isn't like you! It's barely been months since your wedding, and you're already letting her cloud your judgment?"

Ignoring her, Nathaniel turned to leave with Evelyn.

But Evelyn slipped her hand from his grasp and faced Gabrielle. "If I can prove that earring isn't mine, will you apologize?"

Gabrielle hesitated before nodding. "I'll apologize if you prove it's not yours."

Evelyn smirked. "Not good enough. If I prove it, you're paying for everyone's expenses today. An apology won't cut it after you falsely accused me."

Gabrielle nearly laughed. Paying for drinks? That was Evelyn's big demand? Pathetic. Money meant nothing to someone like her.

More importantly, she knew Evelyn couldn't prove anything. No cameras in the changing room. No witnesses. This would be entertaining.

"Fine," Gabrielle agreed smugly. "Deal."

Nathaniel watched Evelyn with a carefully blank expression, though curiosity flickered in his eyes. Even Dominic and the others paused, eager to see how this would play out.

Evelyn extended her hand. "Give me the earring that stabbed your foot."

Gabrielle signaled the doctor to hand it over.

Taking it, Evelyn deliberately pressed the stud against her earlobe for all to see.

Gabrielle scoffed. "Looks lovely on you. A perfect match." Her tone dripped with sarcasm.

Evelyn ignored the jab. "Miss Winslow, take a closer look. Notice anything unusual?"

Gabrielle leaned in—then recoiled. Evelyn's ear was swelling rapidly, turning an angry red. The skin around the stud darkened to purple as if burned. Within seconds, angry welts appeared.

Evelyn yanked the earring off with a wince. Her fingertips touching the metal showed identical reactions—swelling, rashes, discoloration.

"I've had a severe silver allergy since childhood," she explained, rubbing her inflamed skin. "One touch causes this reaction. Since most studs are silver-plated, this clearly isn't mine."

She returned the earring to the stunned doctor.

Gabrielle's face paled. This wasn't possible. She'd been so certain...

"Miss Winslow?" Evelyn prompted. "Your apology?"

The crowd's murmurs grew louder. Gabrielle stood frozen, humiliation burning her cheeks. Refusing now would only make her look worse.

She swallowed hard, the taste of defeat bitter on her tongue.
###Chapter 205

Evelyn arched an eyebrow as Gabrielle offered her saccharine smile. "My deepest apologies, Evelyn. This was all just a terrible misunderstanding. Had you mentioned your silver allergy earlier, none of this unpleasantness would've occurred."

"Miss Winslow," Evelyn countered coolly, "are you suggesting it's my fault you nearly framed me for theft? Should I apologize for not anticipating your accusations?"

Gabrielle's smile faltered. "That's not what I—"

"Save it," Evelyn interrupted with a dry chuckle. "Just remember—you're covering all expenses today."

Though her jaw tightened, Gabrielle forced a nod. "Of course. Consider it my... peace offering."

Before Evelyn could respond, strong hands gripped her shoulders.

Nathaniel's stormy expression filled her vision as he examined her inflamed ear and swollen palm. "Where's the epinephrine?" he barked at the trembling physician.

"S-sir, I need to retrieve it from—"

"Now." The single word sent the doctor scrambling.

Without waiting for permission, Nathaniel swept Evelyn into his arms and strode out.

"Uncle Nate!" Sophia Bennett called after them, scrambling to follow.

Dominic Prescott elbowed Harrison Ford with a smirk. "Harrison, tell me our ice-cold Nathaniel isn't actually smitten."

Harrison's expression remained impassive. "Why ask me?"

"Because you're the expert," Dominic teased. "Weren't you obsessed with that Hopper heiress last season?"

Harrison's glare could've frozen lava. "Fuck off." He stalked away.

Dominic turned to Jonathan Blake. "Did you see that? Total meltdown."

Jonathan chuckled. "You lit the fuse, Dom."

Only Gabrielle and Benjamin Rivers remained in the dressing room.

"Let's get you settled," Benjamin offered.

Gabrielle's manicured nails dug into her palms. "We underestimated her, Ben. She's far more dangerous than she appears."

Benjamin frowned. "You still doubt her? Did you see her allergic reaction?"

"Please," Gabrielle scoffed. "Country girls know all sorts of tricks. That reaction could've been faked."

"You're wrong," Benjamin said firmly. "Evelyn would never hurt you intentionally."

Gabrielle gaped. "Since when do you defend her?"

The change was startling—Benjamin had despised Evelyn more fiercely than Gabrielle herself.

His gaze held steady. "Because she's my friend. And I trust her."

"Friend?" Gabrielle's voice rose. "Since when? Why wasn't I told?"
###Chapter 206

Benjamin spent the next few minutes explaining to Gabrielle how Evelyn had saved him at Silver Moon Estate.

Yet, Gabrielle still couldn't grasp his sudden change of heart toward Evelyn.

"So you're turning against me because Evelyn won a game for you?"

Benjamin shook his head. "I'd never betray you. I just think Evelyn isn't as bad as we thought."

"Benjamin, you've let me down." Gabrielle stood, wincing as she limped out of the room.

He stayed rooted in place, brows furrowed, torn between conflicting emotions.

Under the shade of the parasol.

Nathaniel forced Evelyn to sit on his lap as he applied anti-allergy cream to her irritated skin. Nearby, the doctor stood anxiously, slightly hunched, clutching a bottle of medicine.

Nathaniel’s fingers—slender but calloused—held a cotton swab. He dipped it into the cream and gently dabbed it onto Evelyn’s inflamed earlobe. Then he took her hand, smoothing the cream over the rash on her palm.

The sensation made her twitch. She instinctively tried to pull away.

"Don’t move," Nathaniel ordered sternly.

Evelyn huffed but relented. He was only trying to help, and refusing would make her seem ungrateful.

Not that she had much choice—his grip was unyielding. She couldn’t even struggle.

Grudgingly, she endured the ticklish feeling as he finished applying the cream.

Next, he took the anti-allergy pills from the doctor and held them out to her, a glass of water in his other hand.

Evelyn frowned. "I don’t need medicine. The rash will fade on its own."

Nathaniel’s expression darkened. "Take it."

No one had ever dared to command her like this. Annoyed, she snatched the pills, tossed them into her mouth, and washed them down with a gulp of water.

Only then did he release her.

The ranch had prepared a simple breakfast.

Starving, Evelyn immediately sat down and reached for a bowl of soup—only for Nathaniel to snatch it away before her fingers could even brush the rim.

She glared at him, ready to argue, but he simply scooped a spoonful, blew on it to cool it, and held it to her lips.

Evelyn blinked. "My hands work just fine, you know."

"Open your mouth," he said, ignoring her protest.

The gesture made her skin crawl. "I can feed myself!"

"You’ll smear the cream if you touch anything."

She had no comeback.

Negotiation failed.

Fine. If she weren’t so hungry, she’d never have given in.

Reluctantly, she parted her lips and accepted the spoonful.

Nathaniel continued feeding her with infuriating patience.

Sophia, watching the scene, gasped. "Is that really Uncle Nathaniel? He’s feeding Evelyn just because of a little rash?"

Evelyn’s discomfort grew. Sophia’s commentary made the soup harder to swallow.

Sophia leaned in, eyes sparkling. "Evelyn, you turned this cold-hearted man into a doting husband! Teach me your ways!"

A doting husband? Evelyn shot a skeptical glance at Nathaniel’s stern face.

Hmph. Hardly.

Too embarrassed to keep eating like this, Evelyn hesitated—until Nathaniel shot Sophia a chilling look.

"Have you eaten yet?"

His tone made it clear: Leave.
###Chapter 207

Sophia Bennett giggled and nodded. "Yes, I've eaten. You don't have to worry about me!"

Nathaniel Grayson narrowed his eyes in displeasure. "Then why are you still here?"

Sophia blinked before bursting into laughter. "Oh, I see! I'll get out of your way and stop third-wheeling. Bye! I'm off to check if my pony has grown!"

Once Sophia dashed away, Nathaniel lifted a spoonful of soup to Evelyn Whitmore's lips. She glanced at it, then back at him with a frown. "Nathaniel, do we really need to put on this act in front of Sophia?"

Did she think this was an act?

Nathaniel's gaze turned icy, the rare softness in his eyes freezing over. "Just drink."

Evelyn was baffled but obediently parted her lips, swallowing the soup while internally grumbling, This man's mood swings are ridiculous.

As she took another sip, Nathaniel suddenly called her name sharply. "Evelyn."

"Yes?" She met his eyes, waiting.

He held her gaze with unsettling intensity. After a long pause, he spoke. "Remember this—you never have to prove anything to anyone. Especially not by hurting yourself."

Evelyn frowned. "What if someone frames me? Shouldn't I defend myself?"

Nathaniel's voice was firm. "No matter what happens, I'll believe you. You don't need to prove your innocence to anyone else. To me, you are innocent. Understand?"

Her heart hammered violently. Why does this sound like a vow? Where is this coming from?

Another spoonful hovered near her mouth, but she shook her head. "I'm full."

Nathaniel didn't push. Instead, he brought the spoon to his own lips and drank.

Evelyn's eyes widened, her cheeks flushing.

Sharing utensils? That was something only couples did. And Nathaniel was notoriously particular about hygiene. Why would he do this?

She exhaled sharply. "Nathaniel, you're confusing me. This isn't like you."

Unfazed, he finished the soup. "Get used to it. It won't be a problem later."

Evelyn forced an awkward smile. "Later? Our contract ends in two months. I'll have to break this habit once we—"

"Then let's not end it," Nathaniel said calmly, as if discussing the weather.

Evelyn froze. Did he just suggest... staying together?

Before she could process it, Benjamin Rivers appeared, his expression grim. "Evelyn, I need to talk to you."

Nathaniel cut in coldly. "Say it here."

Benjamin hesitated under his glare. "Nathaniel, this is private."

Evelyn stood. "It's fine, I'll just—"

"Sit down," Nathaniel commanded.

Recognizing his possessiveness, Evelyn leaned close to his ear and whispered, "Relax. I'll tell you everything after."

Instantly, the tension in his eyes eased, and he let her go.

Evelyn followed Benjamin into the woods near Silver Peaks Ranch. "Alright, what's so urgent?"

Without warning, Benjamin braced a hand against a tree, caging her between him and the trunk.
###Chapter 208

Evelyn was taken aback by Benjamin's sudden move, but she crossed her arms and gave him a dismissive look. "What's this about, Benjamin? Explain yourself."

His cheeks flushed as he struggled to voice his thoughts. With youthful determination burning in his eyes, he finally blurted out, "Evelyn Whitmore, I'm going to make you mine!"

The declaration barely fazed her. She studied him with bored amusement, one eyebrow arched. "Aren't you still in high school?"

Benjamin squared his shoulders proudly. "I'll be eighteen in six months!"

Evelyn stifled a yawn. "Come talk to me when you can legally vote." She turned to leave, clearly uninterested in continuing this absurd conversation.

But Benjamin blocked her path, his expression turning serious. "Listen, Evelyn. Stay away from Nathaniel. He belongs with my sister Amelia. If it's money you're after, I can provide that too. The Rivers family fortune is just as impressive."

Trapped against a tree, Evelyn smirked at the naive boy. "You? A kid whose allowance gets cut off when he misbehaves? What exactly could you offer me? A future of babysitting?"

Benjamin's face reddened further, but he had no comeback. "I'm not a child! The age gap is negligible. Once I control my trust fund—"

Evelyn cut him off with a laugh, pushing past him. "Thanks for the laugh, but I don't have time to wait for you to mature. We're incompatible."

She walked away, but Benjamin wasn't done. "Evelyn Whitmore! Nathaniel is meant for Amelia! You can't have him!"

Ah, so that was his real motive—playing knight for his sister. How quaint. If only he knew the truth about her arrangement with Nathaniel.

'Let's not break up.' Nathaniel's unexpected words echoed in her mind. After repeatedly emphasizing their relationship was purely transactional, what had he meant by that? Men truly were incomprehensible creatures.

Evelyn paused, then said calmly, "You're overcomplicating things. Nathaniel isn't mine to give away. Focus on your studies instead of meddling in adult affairs."

"I've already finished my homework!" Benjamin protested indignantly.

"Then go play video games or something." Evelyn waved him off, continuing her walk.

Undeterred, Benjamin trailed after her. "Mark my words, Evelyn! I'll make you fall for me!"

She glanced back with an amused smile. "Really? Then get into Harvard first. I don't date intellectually challenged boys—bad for future offspring." She tapped her temple pointedly.

Benjamin spluttered in outrage. "How dare you question my intelligence!"

Humming to herself, Evelyn left him fuming, his fists clenched in frustration.

'Just wait, Evelyn Whitmore! Getting into an Ivy League is nothing! You'll see!'

Returning to the patio, Evelyn spotted Nathaniel chatting with Dominic and others. She hesitated approaching—Dominic's sharp tongue guaranteed uncomfortable questions about her relationship with Nathaniel.
###Chapter 209

Nathaniel noticed Evelyn from a distance. She'd have some explaining to do if she didn't approach him.

With a resigned sigh, Evelyn walked toward him anyway. "Nathaniel, I'm back."

He took a slow sip of his coffee, watching her over the rim. "What did you two discuss?"

Evelyn waved a dismissive hand. "Nothing important. Just small talk."

His brows furrowed. She'd promised to tell him everything when she returned. Now she was brushing him off.

Dominic grinned and patted the empty chair beside him. "Evelyn! Come join us!"

She shot him a wary glance. Sitting with Dominic meant enduring his teasing. No thanks.

Just then, Sophia bounded over excitedly. "Evelyn! Let's go pick horses! We can race later when it's cooler. The afternoon sun's brutal!"

Evelyn glanced at Nathaniel for approval. "May I?"

Though rebellious by nature, she remembered their public facade. The dutiful wife act required his permission.

Nathaniel's irritation softened slightly at her deference. His gaze warmed as he nodded. "Go ahead."

"Thanks!" She flashed him a quick smile before following Sophia toward the stables.

Nathaniel watched her go, coffee forgotten in his hand. Long after she disappeared, his eyes remained fixed in that direction.

"You've gone soft, Nathaniel," Dominic teased. "What spell has your wife cast on you?"

A cold glare was his only response. "Got a problem with that?"

Dominic shrugged. "Just curious what makes her so special."

Nathaniel's expression turned dangerous. "Curiosity about another man's wife is... unwise."

Harrison snorted. "What he needs is a woman who can put him in his place!"

"Don't project your own failures onto me," Dominic shot back. "Just because you got knocked down once—"

Harrison's face darkened. "You asking for a beating?"

Jonathan stood, attempting to diffuse the tension. "Enough sitting around. Let's ride! Maybe add some stakes to make it interesting?"

Dominic stretched lazily. "You go ahead. Too hot for me."

Jonathan shook his head. "You organized this and won't even participate? Since when are you afraid of a little sun?"

Harrison smirked. "Since always. The man's delicate."

Dominic scowled. "Watch your mouth!"

The stables housed over a hundred magnificent horses.

Evelyn's eyes immediately locked onto a stunning white mare with a distinctive black mark on its forehead. As she reached for the bridle—

"That one's too much for you. Pick another."

Gabrielle's voice cut through the air like a whip.
###Chapter 210

The voice made Evelyn turn. Gabrielle stood a distance away, holding the reins of a chestnut mare.

Evelyn's brow arched. "Your foot healed fast."

Sophia had gone to another stable to fetch her horse, leaving them alone. Without an audience, Gabrielle dropped all pretense.

"Not completely," she sneered. "But this little injury won't stop me from riding."

Evelyn remembered the dramatic screams in the changing room. Yet here Gabrielle stood, perfectly balanced. The act had been obvious.

A smirk played on Evelyn's lips. "Glad to hear it."

She turned toward the stallion she'd chosen, wanting nothing more to do with this conversation.

Gabrielle's mocking voice followed her. "You should stay away from that one. Even if you manage to lead it out, you'll never ride it."

Evelyn paused. There was more to this warning than mere spite. She studied the horse, then Gabrielle. "Why do you say that?"

Contempt dripped from Gabrielle's voice. "That stallion has one master. It tolerates no other rider."

"Who owns it?" Evelyn asked.

"You're not worthy of that knowledge." Gabrielle tossed her hair. "Pick another horse before you embarrass yourself."

The venom was refreshing in its honesty. Evelyn actually smiled. "Thanks for the advice. But answer me this first."

"What now?" Gabrielle snapped.

"Is this hatred because you want Nathaniel for yourself?"

Gabrielle's laugh was sharp. "Nathaniel, Dominic, and I grew up together. Our families are intertwined. You wouldn't understand such bonds, peasant."

Evelyn ignored the jab. "If not for Nathaniel, why the schemes? The watch at the restaurant, today's little drama - all to turn him against me?"

"Since you're so curious," Gabrielle smirked, "I'll tell you. Nathaniel belongs to my dearest friend. I won't stand by while some backwater hussy steals him and breaks her heart."

Understanding dawned. "Benjamin's sister."

"Exactly!" Gabrielle's eyes lit with fervor. "Amelia is perfection itself - noble, gentle, accomplished. You could never compare!"

Evelyn's lips quirked. "Is that so?"

Gabrielle bristled at her indifference. "Since we're speaking of Amelia, know this - Nathaniel adored her. Family politics forced them apart, but that doesn't make you his rightful wife!"
###Chapter 211

Evelyn narrowed her eyes, exhaling sharply in frustration. "You probably won't believe me, but I have zero interest in Nathaniel! Being Mrs. Grayson means nothing to me. All your little schemes are just a waste of your time."

Gabrielle blinked, skepticism flashing across her face. "No interest? Then swear it—swear nothing ever happened between you two, or that you don’t feel anything for him."

Evelyn’s lips pressed into a thin line. She couldn’t. Because something had happened—something she refused to dwell on.

But that night had been beyond her control. No one would understand, and no explanation would make them believe she’d only been trying to help him. The truth was better buried.

Once their three-month arrangement ended, she’d vanish from Nathaniel’s life. That would be proof enough.

Gabrielle scoffed at her silence. "Can’t even swear to it? Funny how you claim not to care, yet you can’t deny it. People like you never walk away from luxury once they’ve tasted it."

Evelyn ignored her. Arguing was pointless.

Just then, Sophia led her horse over, frowning when she spotted Gabrielle. "I thought you were injured. Suddenly well enough to ride?"

Gabrielle’s expression softened instantly. "I rested, Sophia. Didn’t want to miss riding with everyone."

Sophia rolled her eyes. "No one’s dying to ride with you." She turned to Evelyn. "Pick a horse yet? We’re heading out soon."

Evelyn pointed to the same white stallion with the black forehead marking. "That one."

Gabrielle’s eyes widened. Is she insane?

Sophia shook her head. "That horse is trouble, Evelyn. It’s thrown riders before—broken bones, even. Pick another."

But Evelyn liked its defiance. There was fire in its eyes, a spirit that matched hers.

Gabrielle smirked. "Let her try. Maybe she’ll tame it."

Or maybe she’d fall. Either way, Gabrielle wouldn’t mind.
###Chapter 212

Sophia Bennett's brow furrowed. "But—"

Evelyn Whitmore was already leading the stallion out. "Come on. I'm ready to try."

Sophia's concern didn't waver. "Are you sure about this, Evelyn? Stardust is extremely temperamental!"

Evelyn flashed a confident smile. "No need to worry. I feel an instant connection with this one."

"Fine. But promise you'll be extra careful!"

"Absolutely," Evelyn assured.

Gabrielle Winslow trailed behind them, leading the horse while shooting daggers at Evelyn's back with her eyes.

'Connection? More like a death wish! That arrogant country bumpkin is going to eat dirt!'

Truthfully, Gabrielle's limp was completely fake—just part of her earlier act.

Benjamin Rivers came trotting over on his bay gelding. The moment he spotted the white stallion in Evelyn's grip, his face paled.

"You chose Stardust?"

'Stardust? What an unusual name for such a majestic creature,' Evelyn mused. She stroked the horse's silken mane. "Problem?"

Benjamin dismounted with exaggerated concern. "It's not about permission—it's about survival! Stardust only tolerates my sister. Anyone else gets thrown within seconds!"

Evelyn stiffened. 'His sister's horse?'

"Which sister?"

"The eldest. Father gifted her this foal for her third birthday. That crescent marking on its forehead inspired the name." Benjamin's voice grew somber. "After she disappeared... Stardust refused all other riders."

"Seriously, swap horses. One bad fall could paralyze someone your size!"

Evelyn studied the white stallion. Nothing about its demeanor matched their warnings. And that name... why did it tug at her memory?

"Stardust," she tested the name aloud.

The horse turned its head, studying her with intelligent eyes before nudging her shoulder affectionately.

Benjamin yanked Evelyn back in alarm. "See? It's getting agitated! That's how the attacks start!"

Unfazed, Evelyn reached out to stroke Stardust's muzzle, calming the animal instantly.

Gabrielle sidled up to Benjamin. "I warned her too. Some people just won't listen."

"This isn't stubbornness—it's suicide!" Benjamin hissed. "You've seen what Stardust can do!"

Gabrielle shrugged. "What more can we—"

A thunderous whinny cut her off. They whirled to see Evelyn already mounted, reins in hand. "Hyah!"

Stardust reared violently, front hooves slicing air. Only Evelyn's iron grip kept her seated as the stallion bucked wildly.
###Chapter 213

The scene unfolding was nothing short of perilous!

Nathaniel, who had been preparing for a race with Dominic and the others atop his stallion, whipped his head around at the sudden sound of hooves. His piercing gaze locked onto the breathtaking spectacle.

His pupils contracted instantly. Without hesitation, he spurred his prized thoroughbred toward the commotion.

Stardust reared up with an excited whinny before planting its hooves firmly on the ground. To everyone's astonishment, the majestic creature began galloping across the track with Evelyn riding effortlessly on its back. The temperamental horse showed no resistance, accepting its new rider completely.

Benjamin, who had been rushing to intervene, pulled his horse to an abrupt stop. His eyes widened in disbelief. "How is Evelyn riding Stardust so smoothly? That horse won't even let Amelia near it!"

Gabrielle's face twisted in frustration. She'd been anticipating Evelyn's humiliating fall, but instead found herself witnessing an impossible feat. "This can't be happening," she muttered through clenched teeth.

Sophia Bennett watched with stars in her eyes. "Evelyn's incredible! If she can tame Stardust this easily, Uncle Nathaniel doesn't stand a chance against her!"

Seeing Evelyn in complete control, Nathaniel's tense shoulders relaxed slightly. He eased his grip on the reins, allowing his horse to slow its pace. A rare glimmer of admiration shone in his narrowed eyes as he watched the fearless girl command the powerful stallion. "Is there anything she can't do?" he wondered silently.

"Stardust, steady now!" After several exhilarating laps, Evelyn gently pulled back on the reins. The obedient horse immediately transitioned to a comfortable trot.

Evelyn stroked the horse's glossy mane. "You must miss your owner terribly, don't you?"

Though horses couldn't speak, Stardust responded with soft nickers that seemed to confirm Evelyn's words.

"Evelyn! Evelyn!" Sophia called out as she maneuvered her horse alongside. "You're absolutely amazing! I never thought anyone could ride Stardust! My admiration for you grows by the minute!"

Evelyn chuckled and shook her head. "He's actually quite gentle - just fiercely loyal."

"That's because you're special! No one else has ever managed to ride him!" Sophia insisted.

Benjamin and Gabrielle finally caught up, their expressions a mix of awe and irritation.

Benjamin studied Evelyn with newfound respect. "I must admit, I'm impressed. How did you get my sister's horse to accept you so easily?"

Evelyn shrugged. "No special tricks. Just felt like we connected somehow."

Gabrielle couldn't hide her sneer. "Connected? What nonsense! A country girl like you has no business with such an elite thoroughbred. If Nathaniel hadn't brought you here, you'd never have gotten within ten feet of a horse like Stardust in your entire life!"

She forced a tight smile. "Since you're such an expert, why don't we race?"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow, her gaze dropping pointedly to Gabrielle's injured foot. "Are you sure you're up for it? Wouldn't want you blaming me if you aggravate your injury."

Gabrielle's smile turned brittle. "That was all just a misunderstanding, and I've already apologized. Must you keep bringing it up?"

The stark contrast between Gabrielle's private malice and public politeness almost made Evelyn feel sorry for the effort the woman put into her act.

Evelyn gave a small shrug. "Just teasing. I'm happy to race if you're feeling up to it."
###Chapter 214

The crisp morning air carried excited chatter as Benjamin proposed the challenge. "Let's make it interesting! All four of us racing to the forest edge - winner takes bragging rights!"

Sophia Bennett's hand shot up immediately. "You're on!"

With unanimous agreement, they lined up behind the makeshift starting point, each adjusting their positions to ensure fair spacing between their horses.

"Nathaniel's voice cut through the preparations like a blade through silk. "Evelyn."

She turned Stardust sharply, spotting the imposing figure of Nathaniel Grayson astride Celestial Pursuit. The morning sun glinted off his polished riding boots, casting him in an almost regal light. Every inch the powerful CEO, yet here he sat like some medieval monarch surveying his domain.

Evelyn tilted her head. "Yes, Mr. Grayson?"

"Come here." Two simple words delivered with that quiet authority that made refusal unthinkable.

Frowning, she nudged Stardust forward, aware of three pairs of curious eyes watching this unexpected interruption.

When they stood mere feet apart, Nathaniel's gaze swept over her - first the nearly healed swelling on her ears, then down to her gloved hands gripping the reins. "Your hand."

Without understanding why, Evelyn found herself extending her bare palm toward him. His fingers turned it over carefully, inspecting the skin where the allergic rash had been. She saw his shoulders relax minutely at the healed condition.

"Mr. Grayson?" Impatience colored her tone.

Wordlessly, he produced a chilled water bottle from his saddlebag, cracked the seal, and offered it. "Hydrate before you exhaust yourself."

Evelyn blinked. That was it? She'd expected... something more dramatic. Still, her throat was parched, so she accepted, drinking deeply before handing it back. "Satisfied? May I race now?"

Nathaniel merely nodded, watching as she wheeled Stardust around without a backward glance. The thought crossed her mind - Since when did the formidable Nathaniel Grayson turn into a mother hen?

Behind her, Nathaniel took a measured sip from the same bottle before recapping it, his gaze lingering on Evelyn's retreating form.

Dominic Prescott chose that moment to arrive, mischief dancing in his eyes. "How gallant, Nathaniel! Delivering refreshments to your blushing bride like some knight errant!"

Nathaniel's glare could have frozen lava. It didn't deter Dominic, who snatched up his own water bottle and mimicked Nathaniel's stern tone to Harrison Ford beside him. "Drink, my darling, before you perish of thirst! Your cracked lips wound me deeply!"
###Chapter 215

Nathaniel's lips curled in disgust at Dominic's theatrics.

Harrison remained stoic, his expression unreadable as he raised his riding crop.

With a sharp flick of his wrist, he struck the hindquarters of Dominic's horse.

The animal reared in panic before bolting forward, dragging a startled Dominic with it.

"Damn it, Nathaniel!" Dominic's furious shout echoed across the field as he struggled to regain control. "That wasn't funny!"

Nathaniel tucked his crop away, feigning innocence.

Jonathan chuckled under his breath. "Harrison, Nathaniel—shall we finish our race over there?"

Harrison nodded. "Let's."

Nathaniel gave a noncommittal grunt, but his gaze instinctively sought out Evelyn. She was already ahead, Stardust carrying her swiftly toward the forest, leaving the others far behind.

The three men continued their race, passing time until Dominic finally returned, still grumbling about his abrupt departure.

But as the minutes stretched into an hour, unease settled in Nathaniel's chest. Evelyn, Sophia, Benjamin, and Gabrielle should have returned by now. The ranch was vast, but the riding trails were limited. Even with multiple races, they should have been back.

Horses tired faster than riders.

Nathaniel cleared a jump on the course, but his focus wavered. Something felt wrong.

Then, movement in the distance caught his attention.

Three figures on horseback approached—but only three.

No Evelyn.

Nathaniel's grip tightened on the reins as they drew closer. His voice was dangerously calm. "Where is Evelyn?"

Sophia's face was ghostly pale, her hands trembling. "Uncle, she—"

Nathaniel's pulse spiked. "What happened?"

Sophia burst into tears. "She won the race, so we stopped to rest in the woods. When we got back on our horses, Stardust suddenly went wild! It took off with her before we could stop it!"

She choked on a sob. "We chased them, but Stardust was too fast. By the time we caught up, the horse was standing near the cliff—but Evelyn was gone! We think... she fell!"

Benjamin's jaw clenched, his eyes bloodshot with guilt. "Nathaniel, I'm sorry—"

Gabrielle, the most composed of the three, stepped forward. "Nathaniel, Benjamin and I warned Evelyn not to ride that horse today. She didn’t listen. This wouldn’t have happened if—"

Nathaniel didn’t wait for excuses.

With a sharp tug of the reins, he urged his horse over the fence and toward the cliff at full speed.

A life was at stake.

Dominic, Harrison, and Jonathan exchanged glances before mounting their own horses and racing after him.
###Chapter 216

Stardust, the white mare, paced nervously at the cliff's edge, her distressed whinnies cutting through the air. A torn scrap of crimson fabric fluttered from a jagged rock—the same shade as Evelyn's riding suit.

Nathaniel reined in Celestial Pursuit with a sharp tug. He dismounted in one fluid motion and strode to the precipice. His piercing gaze scanned the abyss below, but the chasm swallowed all light.

The thunder of approaching hooves announced Dominic, Harrison, and Jonathan's arrival.

Three sets of boots hit the ground simultaneously. Their expressions darkened as they took in the ominous scene.

Dominic shed his usual smirk, stepping forward to grip Nathaniel's shoulder. "I'm sorry, man."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened.

"Sorry?" His voice was ice. "Save your condolences." He turned toward his saddlebag, yanking out a coiled climbing rope. "I'm going down. You three—get a rescue team here now."

Harrison caught his arm. "Think this through, Nathaniel."

Dominic blocked his path. "That's suicide! We don't know what's down there!"

Jonathan retrieved the scarlet fabric fragment, examining it with a grimace. "Such a waste. She was so young—"

Nathaniel wrenched free. "Move. Or I'll throw you all off this cliff myself."

Sophia, Benjamin, and Gabrielle arrived just in time to see Nathaniel secure the rope around an ancient oak and step into the void.

"Uncle Nathaniel!" Sophia screamed.

Gabrielle's hands flew to her mouth. "No!"

Benjamin spurred his mount forward. "Idiot! He's roped in!"

Sophia hiccuped, wiping snot on her sleeve. "B-but what if Evelyn's—"

"Shut up and blow your nose." Benjamin tossed her a tissue pack. "You're disgusting."

Gabrielle stood frozen. The realization hit like a physical blow—Nathaniel would literally descend into hell for Evelyn.

What does that make Amelia?

The cliff's belly was a festering wound—dank, tangled, and lightless. Nathaniel's rope strained taut.

The bottom remained miles away.
###Chapter 217

Nathaniel's boot connected with the jagged cliff face, propelling him backward as he untied the rope. His landing sent vibrations through the uneven ground.

The impact startled a cluster of bats into chaotic flight.

Brushing thorny weeds from his clothes, his piercing gaze swept the harsh terrain. The cliff base offered no comforts - only an unforgiving landscape that made his gut tighten.

No sign of Evelyn. Dead or alive, he'd tear this place apart to find her.

Pushing through dense foliage, his search became frantic. Then - movement. A dark shape lunged from behind.

Nathaniel pivoted, delivering a crushing kick that sent the brown bear sprawling. The beast recovered quickly, saliva dripping from yellowed fangs. Starvation gleamed in its wild eyes as it sized up this new prey.

Three precise strikes later, the bear lay whimpering on the ground.

Nathaniel's fingers closed around the compact shotgun at his waist. If this creature had harmed Evelyn...

"Don't shoot!" The voice echoed through the gorge like a ghostly whisper.

His head snapped toward the sound. There - filthy, disheveled, but unmistakably alive - stood Evelyn. Her clothes hung in tatters, yet energy sparked in her eyes as she picked her way through the undergrowth.

Before she could speak, Nathaniel crushed her against his chest. The force knocked the air from her lungs.

She squirmed free, gasping. "That's a protected species! You can't just-"

"Self-defense exceptions exist," he growled, scanning her for injuries. The tension in his shoulders eased slightly seeing her intact. "Why the hell did you jump down?"

Evelyn scowled. "I didn't fall! I was waiting on a ledge when I saw you rappelling down. Called out but you didn't hear. Had to jump after you!" She gestured angrily at her torn sleeve. "Hence the wardrobe malfunction."

Nathaniel's grip tightened on her shoulders. "You risked your neck because...?"

Evelyn's mouth opened, then snapped shut. She turned away, cheeks flushing. "Same reason you came down here, obviously."

A beat of silence. Then Nathaniel's laughter rang out, startling nearby birds. He ruffled her tangled hair roughly. "At least my wife has the sense to worry about me."

Evelyn rolled her eyes so hard it hurt.
###Chapter 218

Evelyn's lips curved into a dry smile, deciding she'd had enough of Nathaniel's company.

She stepped past him, crouching beside the injured brown bear sprawled on the ground. Her eyes scanned its condition carefully.

The bear was battered, too weak to flee. When it noticed her approach, it bared its teeth in a feeble attempt to intimidate.

Evelyn tilted her head, studying its pitiful state. "Tsk. Big, but still just a cub. Trying so hard to be scary, but it's kind of adorable."

Nathaniel moved beside her, his gaze cold as he assessed the creature. He couldn't fathom what she found cute about it.

"Mister, this species doesn’t belong in this kind of terrain. Probably got lost, just like us." She shrugged. "No point in killing it when we're all stuck here. Let it go."

"Fine." Nathaniel didn’t argue. His expression remained indifferent as he spun the compact silver shotgun in his hand before tucking it into the back of his waistband.

Evelyn studied him, suspicion flickering in her eyes. His ease with firearms suggested there was more to him than just being the Grayson heir.

"Do you always carry a gun?"

"Not usually." His tone was flat. "But the ranch borders the wilderness. Better safe than sorry."

"Oh." She subtly shifted a step away.

Nathaniel noticed, his eyes narrowing. "Problem? Am I making you nervous?"

Evelyn shook her head. "Not you. Just the gun."

He reached out, flicking her forehead lightly. "Save the attitude for when we're not stranded."

She scowled, rubbing the spot he'd hit. What’s that supposed to mean? Calling me petty now?

"What about the rope you used to climb down? Can’t the guys up top pull us up one by one?"

Nathaniel tilted his chin upward, directing her attention to the frayed rope dangling far above them—completely out of reach.

Evelyn sighed. "Guess we're finding shelter instead. No telling how long it’ll take for them to locate us, and nights here are freezing."

"Agreed."

She started walking, only to feel the sudden weight of Nathaniel’s coat draping over her shoulders. The gesture caught her off guard.

"Thanks," she muttered, unsure how to react.

Nathaniel said nothing, falling into step beside her.

A soft whimper echoed behind them.

Evelyn paused, glancing back at the wounded bear. Its cries sounded almost like a child’s.

She arched a brow. "What if we take it with us?"
###Chapter 219

Nathaniel studied Evelyn's face. "If that's what you wish."

She gave a single nod.

Without another word, he turned and secured the brown bear with thick vines, hoisting the massive creature onto his shoulders as he followed behind her.

Their journey through the valley seemed endless, the damp air clinging to their clothes. Finally, a small cave appeared at the base of the ravine - their temporary refuge.

The entrance was nearly invisible beneath overgrown vegetation. Nathaniel set the bear down with care, rolling up his sleeves with practiced ease before tearing through the waist-high plants blocking their way.

Evelyn moved to assist, but his hand shot out to stop her. The warning in his steel-gray eyes made her retreat. She watched, fascinated, as the usually immaculate businessman worked with surprising efficiency, his muscles straining against the stubborn roots.

She was so distracted by the sight that she failed to notice the danger until sharp pain lanced through her arm. "Ah!"

Looking down, she saw the culprit - a yellow-green snake with distinctive marble patterning, its fangs still embedded in her flesh. With quick reflexes, she seized the reptile and flung it into the underbrush, leaving behind two puncture wounds that welled with blood.

Nathaniel was at her side instantly. "What happened?"

"Just a snakebite," she said, wiping away the blood. "Probably harmless."

His expression darkened as he examined the wounds. Without hesitation, he pressed his lips to the punctures, drawing out the venom before spitting it onto the ground.

Evelyn watched in stunned silence as he searched the surrounding foliage, plucking a broadleaf plant. He chewed the leaves into a poultice and applied it to her wound, then tore a strip from his shirt to secure the dressing.

"Disgusted?" he asked when he noticed her frown.

She shook her head. "Impressed, actually. Didn't expect a corporate tycoon to know wilderness medicine."

His gaze remained steady. "A girl taught me after I got bitten once."

Evelyn's lips twisted wryly. "Of course. Should've known you'd have women teaching you survival skills."

Nathaniel's mouth quirked. "Does that bother you?"

She turned away abruptly, focusing on the bear carcass. "Why would it? We're not actually together. Your romantic history means nothing to me."

His eyes narrowed. "Are you sure about that?"
###Chapter 220

Evelyn shrugged casually. "Not at all. I could even tell you about my past relationships."

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed. "What kind of past? You claimed you've never dated anyone."

She nodded calmly. "That's true, but it doesn't mean I haven't had crushes. Lots of them."

His expression darkened instantly. A bitter smile twisted his lips. "Is that so? Do enlighten me."

Too busy recalling names to notice his reaction, Evelyn began listing famous actors and musicians she'd admired over the years.

To Nathaniel, who barely followed pop culture, these names sounded like real people from Evelyn's personal history.

Her voice turned dreamy. "When I was eighteen, there was this singer I adored so much I imagined marrying him! His name was-"

"Enough!" Nathaniel's sharp command startled both Evelyn and the nearby bear.

She blinked at him. "Why are you shouting? You asked me to talk about them."

His jaw clenched. Without another word, he grabbed the startled bear and stalked into the cave, tossing the animal into a corner.

Evelyn followed, confused by his sudden mood swing.

The cave's interior was pitch black. Their phones had no signal but provided enough light to see by.

Nathaniel sat near the entrance, one leg stretched out, the other bent with his arm resting on his knee. He lit a cigarette with practiced ease, the flame briefly illuminating his stormy expression.

He smoked in sullen silence.

Evelyn couldn't understand his anger after their earlier conversation. She'd never met someone so temperamental.

Deciding to match his silence, she leaned against the cave wall and waited for rescue. Eventually, exhaustion pulled her into sleep.

She woke at dusk, chilled despite wearing Nathaniel's coat. He sat beside her, eyes closed as if asleep.

Thirst drove Evelyn to slip out quietly. The gorge was damp but lacked visible water sources.

Then she spotted it - a water tree. Her steps quickened with recognition.

Using a sharp stone, she made a small cut in the bark. Clear sap flowed immediately. She drank deeply, the liquid cool and refreshing.

As she turned to leave, hesitation struck. Should she bring some back for Nathaniel?

Moody as he was, he'd risked his life coming down the cliff for her. And they'd shared good times before today.

Her decision made, she prepared to collect some sap for him.
###Chapter 221

Evelyn searched frantically for something to hold water. Spotting some large reeds nearby, she deftly folded their broad leaves into a makeshift cup. Though it leaked slightly, she knew it would work if she moved quickly.

With the leaf cup filled to the brim, Evelyn hurried back to the cave.

Nathaniel remained exactly where she'd left him - eyes closed, unmoving.

Kneeling beside him, she gently shook his shoulder. "Sir? You need to drink something!"

No response.

She tried again, more forcefully this time. "Nathaniel! Wake up!"

Still nothing. A cold dread settled in Evelyn's stomach.

This wasn't right. The man she knew had razor-sharp instincts. He wouldn't sleep this deeply in dangerous wilderness. Only one explanation made sense - he'd lost consciousness.

The realization hit her like a physical blow. That snake bite earlier... Nathaniel had sucked out the venom without rinsing his mouth. Had the poison affected him?

Her hands trembled as she set the leaf cup aside and gripped his shoulders. "Nathaniel! Can you hear me?"

Nothing.

Panic clawed at her throat. Without water, his condition would deteriorate rapidly. Especially if toxins coursed through his veins.

She tried pouring water into his mouth, but it just spilled down his chin. Useless.

Taking a steadying breath, Evelyn made her decision. She took a mouthful of water, cradled Nathaniel's face, and leaned in...

Just as their lips were about to meet, his eyes flew open.

Evelyn froze, their faces inches apart. She swallowed hard and jerked back. "You're awake! Here, drink this." She thrust the remaining water toward him.

Nathaniel's piercing gaze flicked to the leaf cup, then back to her swollen cheeks. Understanding dawned in his sharp eyes.

Then, without warning, his eyelids fluttered shut again.

Evelyn's breath caught. "Nathaniel?"

No response. Her pulse pounded in her ears. What was happening to him? Was he slipping away?
###Chapter 222

Evelyn clutched Nathaniel's arm tightly, shaking him with urgency. "Sir! Hey! Wake up! Don't you dare scare me like this—"

The man exhaled slowly, keeping his eyes shut for nearly a full minute before speaking. "Why did you stop what you were doing?"

'What I was doing—?' Realization dawned on Evelyn, her lips curling in disgust. "Typical man! Don't even think about taking liberties with me!"

Furious at his attempted manipulation, she thrust the remaining leaf-cup of water at him. "Drink it yourself! I nearly broke my back fetching this for you, and it's leaking everywhere!"

Though not thirsty, Nathaniel accepted the offering—her rare act of kindness couldn't be refused. His striking eyes flickered open as he took the makeshift vessel, tilting his head back to drain the last drops.

Then he froze.

The empty reed-leaf cup trembled in his grip. His dark irises contracted sharply. "Have we... met before?"

Evelyn sat hugging her knees nearby, rolling her eyes at what she assumed was another ploy. "Spare me the amnesia act. This isn't the time or place for games."

Nathaniel's expression remained grave. "I mean years ago. A long time ago."

The intensity in his voice gave her pause. Evelyn studied him warily. "Doubtful. I lived in the middle of nowhere until eighteen. No chance I'd cross paths with some city tycoon."

Nathaniel's gaze turned distant, memories surfacing. A decade prior, he'd traveled to rural areas inspecting his company's poverty relief initiatives when rivals ambushed him. Bleeding and desperate, he'd hidden in a village's mountain woods awaiting rescue.

The blood attracted a viper.

As venom coursed through him, a child appeared—no older than ten, yet astonishingly composed. She'd torn her hair ribbon to tourniquet his arm, sucked the poison from his wound with her own mouth, then applied chewed herbs she identified as snakebite antidotes.

For three days she returned with food and water carried in folded leaf-cups just like this one.

Blinded by residual toxins, he never saw her face. When his men finally arrived, the girl was absent. He'd left his mother's prayer beads with a subordinate to gift her, along with an open invitation to seek help at the Grayson estate.

Later, a girl arrived with the beads—Amelia Rivers, who'd been vacationing nearby. The mystery seemed solved.

Until now.

The identical leaf-cup trembled in Nathaniel's hand, its creases mirroring those from a decade past. His voice dropped to a whisper. "It was you."
###Chapter 223

The leaf cup Evelyn had made withered too soon. The maids had thrown it away during their routine cleaning of Nathaniel's room.

Nathaniel was genuinely surprised Evelyn could craft something so delicate.

"Someone's coming, Nathaniel!" Evelyn's voice snapped him back to reality. At the cave entrance, a beam of light flickered as helicopter blades chopped through the air.

Nathaniel grabbed Evelyn's hand and rushed toward the opening. A chopper hovered low over the gorge, its searchlight sweeping the terrain. Rescue had arrived!

Evelyn waved her phone's flashlight frantically toward the aircraft. The pilot spotted the signal immediately and maneuvered for landing.

The cabin door burst open. Dominic Prescott and Harrison Ford leaped out before the skids touched ground.

"Nathaniel! Evelyn! Are you hurt?" Dominic shone his flashlight over them in quick assessment.

Evelyn shook her head. "We're fine."

Nathaniel's glare could freeze lava. "Finished your five-course meal before coming, Prescott?"

Harrison stepped forward. "Traffic jammed the mountain road. Our choppers were too large for the gorge. Dominic had to source this smaller one."

Dominic spread his hands. "Took me hours to find someone willing to lend this piece of junk. Not exactly standard equipment for billionaires."

Nathaniel pinched the bridge of his nose. "Save the excuses for later."

He guided Evelyn toward the helicopter when a pitiful whimper echoed from the cave. Evelyn froze, turning pleading eyes toward Nathaniel.

"Understood." Nathaniel didn't need her to finish. "There's one more inside. Bring it."

Dominic blinked. "One more? Who—"

Minutes later, rescuers emerged carrying an injured bear cub.

Dominic's eyebrows shot up. "Since when does the Ice King of Wall Street rescue wildlife?"

Nathaniel remained impassive. "She wants it. We'll keep it a few days before release."

Dominic whistled. "Damn, Grayson. Who knew you had this side? Husband material right here."

"Go to hell." Nathaniel boarded without another glance.

At the cliffside, Sophia Bennett nearly tackled Evelyn the moment they landed. "Evelyn! Thank God you're alive!" she sobbed into Evelyn's shoulder. "I thought I'd lost you!"
###Chapter 224

Evelyn stood torn between laughter and tears, helplessly patting Sophia's trembling back.

"Shh... It's alright now. I'm safe."

Benjamin approached with a scowl, his voice laced with concern. "Are you hurt, Evelyn?"

Sophia clung to Evelyn like a lifeline, refusing to let go. With no other choice, Evelyn let her stay wrapped around her as she glanced up at Benjamin with a knowing smirk.

"Disappointed I survived?"

His frown deepened. "Why would I be?"

Evelyn tilted her head. "If I were gone, you wouldn’t have to deal with your sister’s rival anymore, right?"

Benjamin scoffed. "I don’t want you dead! I just—"

A sudden, frantic neigh cut him off. Stardust, the white stallion, bolted toward Evelyn from the cliff's edge.

Tension spiked instantly. That same horse had thrown Evelyn off earlier—what if it attacked again?

Nathaniel's eyes sharpened. He moved swiftly, positioning himself protectively in front of Evelyn and Sophia.

Dominic, Harrison, and Jonathan stepped forward as well, forming a human barricade against the agitated horse.

Stardust skidded to a halt, pacing restlessly when blocked. Its distressed whinnies filled the air.

Evelyn gently pried Sophia away and nudged past the protective line.

Nathaniel seized her wrist. "Don’t."

She met his gaze steadily. "It’s fine. Let me check on him."

Reluctantly, he released her but stayed close, his body tense.

Evelyn approached Stardust, raising a hand to stroke his muzzle. "Easy, boy. I’m okay. You didn’t mean to."

The horse’s frantic energy eased. He nudged her shoulder gently, almost apologetically, letting out a soft, mournful sound.

A laugh bubbled up in Evelyn’s throat at the ticklish sensation.

Nathaniel exhaled, some of the tension leaving his frame.

Sophia wiped her tears, sniffling. "He wouldn’t leave after you fell. We tried to shoo him away, but he kept coming back. He knew he messed up."

Evelyn’s expression darkened. She turned to Sophia. "It wasn’t his fault. Someone tampered with him."

Sophia gasped. "You mean—someone used him to hurt you?"

Night had fallen, and Evelyn didn’t elaborate. Instead, her gaze swept over the group before landing on Dominic.

"Hey, you. Hand over your flashlight."

Dominic blinked, then smirked, twirling the device between his fingers. "My name isn’t 'you.' Say 'Dominic,' and maybe I’ll consider it."

Evelyn grinned. "Sure thing, you."

She snatched the flashlight right out of his hand.

Dominic clicked his tongue. "Rude."
###Chapter 225

Evelyn walked past Dominic without a glance, heading straight to Stardust's side.

Nathaniel's lips curved slightly when he noticed how the usually chatty Dominic was visibly taken aback by her dismissal.

She removed the saddle from Stardust's back, handed it to Nathaniel, and shone the flashlight along the horse's flank. Her fingers combed through the animal's coat with deliberate care.

A glint caught the light.

Evelyn adjusted the beam and gasped. Embedded in Stardust's flesh was a diamond-studded earring - identical to the one that had pierced Gabrielle's foot earlier that day.

Nathaniel's sharp eyes narrowed dangerously at the discovery.

Due to her silver allergy, Evelyn avoided touching the jewelry and turned to address the group. "Come see what made Stardust lose control today."

Curious murmurs rose as everyone crowded closer. Their expressions shifted from shock to suspicion as they turned toward Gabrielle, who had been pretending concern for Evelyn moments before.

Benjamin's face darkened with anger. "How could you do this, Gabrielle?"

Gabrielle feigned innocence. "Me? I don't know what you're implying, Benjamin!"

He pointed accusingly at the earring. "Explain this! Why is your earring buried in Stardust's hide? You must have slipped it under the saddle when no one was looking - knowing it would drive the horse wild when Evelyn mounted it!"

Gabrielle paled, trembling. "That's absurd! Just because it resembles my earring doesn't prove anything!"

Benjamin's disgust grew at her refusal to confess. "Who else could it be? I don't wear earrings, and Evelyn's allergic to silver!"

Panicked, Gabrielle blurted out, "Sophia was here too! Why aren't you accusing her?"

Sophia's eyes flashed with outrage. "What are you insinuating, Gabrielle? That I'd try to kill someone I barely tolerate? That makes no sense!"

Evelyn nearly choked at Sophia's backhanded declaration of 'tolerance.'

Gabrielle backtracked hastily. "I didn't mean- I just meant you shouldn't assume it's me-"

Sophia crossed her arms. "Then who? Evelyn can't touch silver, and she's not suicidal. That leaves... me?" Her voice dripped with sarcasm.

Gabrielle floundered. "No, Sophia, I-"

Her weak defense only dug her grave deeper.

Sophia turned to Nathaniel in disgust. "Uncle, you should stay far away from women like her. She's clearly dangerous!"

Nathaniel's icy glare could have frozen lava. The silent fury radiating from him made Gabrielle quake.

"It wasn't me, Nathaniel!" she pleaded desperately. "I swear!"
###Chapter 226

The tiny ear stud wouldn't hold fingerprints—not after being on the horse's body for so long.

There were no surveillance cameras in the woods. No hard evidence to prove Gabrielle was behind it.

Yet the truth hung in the air, undeniable.

Nathaniel didn’t respond to Gabrielle. Instead, he reached out and adjusted Evelyn’s jacket.

"It's cold. Let’s go back to the hotel."

At Silver Peaks Ranch Resort.

The doctor examined the snake bite on Evelyn’s arm and commended their quick first aid. Though the snake wasn’t venomous, the broadleaf plant they’d used had worked as a natural antiseptic.

Nathaniel exhaled in relief.

"Keep the wound dry," the doctor advised before excusing himself.

Once he left, Evelyn asked Sophia to fetch plastic wrap from the kitchen. She secured it over the bite, ensuring it wouldn’t get wet.

Now, she could finally shower.

Dirt clung to her skin, her hair gritty with dust. The thought of sleeping like this was unbearable.

Nathaniel watched her movements, arms crossed as he leaned against the bathroom doorframe.

"Need help?"

Evelyn shot him a look. "How generous of you. But no, thanks."

He stepped closer, his voice low. "I insist. I’m very… thorough."

Her cheeks burned. "That sounds inappropriate."

Nathaniel feigned innocence. "I meant washing your back. What were you thinking?"

She sputtered. "You—!"

If she couldn’t outwit him, she’d outrun him. She bolted into the bathroom and slammed the door.

Since when had Nathaniel become so shameless?

His laughter followed her. Teasing her had become a habit—one he enjoyed far too much.

Sophia stood frozen, wide-eyed.

"Uncle Nathaniel, I never pegged you for the flirty type. I was starting to think you were allergic to romance!"

His amusement vanished. A sharp glare silenced her.

"Stay with her. I have business to attend to."

Sophia snapped to attention. "Yes, sir! She won’t leave my sight!"
###Chapter 227

Nathaniel seemed pleased with the outcome as he strode out of the room.

When Evelyn emerged from the bathroom, towel-drying her damp hair, she noticed only Sophia remained. Her eyes instinctively searched the space for Nathaniel.

"Hey Evelyn!" Sophia bounded over. "Uncle Nate went out. Probably to deal with that horrible Gabrielle for you."

Evelyn froze, brows knitting together.

Gabrielle was indeed despicable - manipulative, deceitful, and now attempted murder. Still, Nathaniel had known Gabrielle, Dominic, and the others for years. Would he really sever ties over her, his temporary contract wife?

Moreover, Gabrielle was Amelia's closest friend. Even if Nathaniel was furious, he wouldn't go too far for Amelia's sake.

As Evelyn pondered this, Sophia giggled and grabbed her hand. "Let me dry your hair!"

"I can manage." Evelyn waved her off gently, continuing to towel her hair.

Sophia shook her head sternly. "Absolutely not! Mountain nights get freezing. You'll catch a cold sleeping with wet hair! Besides, Uncle Nate specifically told me to take care of you. He'll have my head if you get sick!"

Sophia had clearly constructed an elaborate fantasy about Evelyn and Nathaniel's relationship.

Resigned, Evelyn pressed her lips together. She tried insisting she could do it herself, but Sophia forcefully seated her and began blow-drying with her personal travel dryer.

The quiet device allowed conversation to continue. "So Evelyn, I saw you brought back a bear. Planning to barbecue it?"

Barbecue? Evelyn nearly choked.

The warm airflow made her eyelids grow heavy. "It's endangered," she murmured sleepily. "Couldn't let Nathaniel kill it. Few remain - better to hand it over to authorities."

Sophia gasped. "That's so like you!"

Evelyn frowned. "Meaning?"

"Uncle Nate's an internationally renowned hunter. Goes on annual expeditions. Never spares any animal - until you spoke up for that bear. No one else could've changed his mind."

Evelyn arched a skeptical brow. "Really?"

"Absolutely!" Sophia nodded vigorously. "You've only been married a month - you'll learn how ruthless he can be."

"Is this how you repay his kindness?" Evelyn asked dryly.

"Well, he's sweet to me - I'm family! But outsiders? Completely merciless. Terrifying, really."

Evelyn had heard rumors of Nathaniel's brutality. It's why she'd panicked upon realizing the stranger she'd kissed was Nathaniel Grayson.

Yet she'd never witnessed this infamous cruelty firsthand. Was he truly that frightening?

A sudden knock interrupted them.

Sophia switched off the dryer and hurried to answer.
###Chapter 228

The door swung open to reveal Benjamin standing there, his usual arrogant expression plastered across his face.

Evelyn's nose wrinkled in distaste at the sight of him. "What do you want?"

"I need to speak with Evelyn," Benjamin declared.

Sophia crossed her arms. "And why should we trust you? You're clearly on Gabrielle's side. We don't want anything to do with you!"

Benjamin's face flushed with anger. "Out of my way! I'm not here for you!"

He shoved past Sophia into the room. His proud demeanor faltered when he saw Evelyn's bandaged arm. "I... heard about the snake incident."

Evelyn lounged in her chair, one leg crossed over the other. "Your sources are correct."

Benjamin shifted uncomfortably. "Are you... okay?"

A faint smile played on Evelyn's lips. "Perfectly fine. It wasn't venomous. I imagine that ruins your day."

Benjamin's brows furrowed. "Evelyn, I'm not the monster you think I am! Yes, I want you away from Nathaniel, but I don't wish you dead!"

Sophia marched over, hands on hips. "You're hilarious, Benjamin! Who died and made you the relationship police? Evelyn and Uncle Nathaniel are married - what they do is none of your business!"

Benjamin's ears turned red with fury. "Hmph! Shut up, you little brat!"

Sophia stomped her foot. "Who are you calling a brat?"

The argument escalated quickly.

"You're the brat here!"

These two never failed to bicker whenever they crossed paths.

Evelyn massaged her temples in exasperation.

After several minutes of heated exchange, Benjamin threw up his hands. "I'm a gentleman! Gentlemen don't argue with children!"

Turning back to Evelyn, his expression grew serious. "Listen, I need a favor."

Evelyn's eyebrow arched. "Now this is unexpected. The great Benjamin Rivers asking me for help?"

Benjamin struggled to find the right words. Finally, he forced out, "After today's incident... Nathaniel is pulling his investment from the Winslow family business. They've been struggling for years, and without that capital..."

He swallowed hard. "They'll go bankrupt. I'm asking you to talk to Nathaniel. Convince him to give Gabrielle another chance."

Evelyn blinked in surprise. Her mind raced.

'So Nathaniel is actually taking action against Gabrielle?'

When she didn't respond immediately, Benjamin pressed on. "Gabrielle is Amelia's best friend. What she did was wrong, but she did it for my sister. I can't just stand by and do nothing."

Evelyn met his gaze calmly. "You're asking the wrong person. The victim shouldn't be pleading for the perpetrator. Why not ask your sister to intervene?"

Benjamin's face paled. "No! Amelia can't know about this. She's too fragile right now - both physically and emotionally. If she finds out what Gabrielle did for her sake..."

Evelyn observed the change in him with interest. The usually arrogant young man now looked genuinely concerned, his voice softening when speaking of his sister.

Such sibling devotion was rare.

Amelia Rivers - Nathaniel's beloved ex.

Her brother worried that the truth might disturb her sleep, while her best friend had nearly committed murder on her behalf.
###Chapter 229

Evelyn was certain Amelia must have been an extraordinary person to inspire such fierce loyalty in so many people.

She pondered for a moment before turning to Benjamin. "Here's an idea. Your family's wealthy too, aren't they? Even if Nathaniel withdraws his investment from Gabrielle's family business, your relatives could step in and save your sister's best friend."

Benjamin's expression turned sheepish. "I don't have any authority over my family's finances yet... My brother maintains strict boundaries between business and personal matters, and he's never liked Gabrielle. So that's... not possible."

Evelyn offered an apologetic shrug. "Then I'm afraid there's nothing I can do."

She knew her influence over Nathaniel was limited, and financial decisions weren't her domain. Even if he would listen, pleading Gabrielle's case wasn't something she'd ever consider.

Helping someone who'd repeatedly harmed her—nearly costing her life—went against her principles. She believed firmly in karma: good deeds rewarded, misdeeds punished. Those who made bad choices had to face the consequences.

Benjamin's face twisted in frustration as he leaned forward urgently. "Evelyn, I'm begging you. Please talk to Nathaniel—"

Evelyn remained unmoved. She crossed her arms on the chair's armrest, tilting her head against her hand. "I'm tired."

Sophia immediately swooped in, shoving Benjamin back. "You heard her! Evelyn needs rest, so get out! Stop bothering her!"

Benjamin's already foul mood darkened further at Sophia's interference. "Sophia Bennett, this is between Evelyn and me. Stay out of it!"

Sophia planted herself firmly between them. "Everything concerning Evelyn concerns me! This isn't the first time Gabrielle's targeted her. Nathaniel's retaliation is justified—if anything, she's getting off lightly!"

Outmatched in verbal sparring, Benjamin's temples pulsed with visible veins. "Back off! This doesn't involve you!"

When he tried to maneuver around her, Sophia spread her arms wide. "You're the one who needs to leave! This is my uncle and Evelyn's room—I have every right to be here!"

"Sophia Bennett! You—you're impossible!"

Sophia burst into laughter. "That's the best you've got? 'Impossible'? Here's one for you—Benjamin Rivers, you're utterly clueless!"

"Sophia Bennett!"

Their escalating argument made Evelyn's head throb.

With a quiet sigh, she seized the moment to slip away unnoticed, seeking refuge elsewhere.

Meanwhile, in another room...

"Alright, Nathaniel! I admit it—I planted the earring in the boot! But I only meant to scare Evelyn! I never imagined Stardust would throw her off the cliff—"

Terrified into full confession, Gabrielle offered no resistance once Nathaniel threatened to withdraw funding from her family's struggling business.

The Winslow enterprise had been floundering for years, sustained only by Grayson Group's investments. Without Nathaniel's backing, they'd collapse completely.

Once, Nathaniel had invested out of consideration for Amelia. Now, he considered withdrawing because of Evelyn.
###Chapter 230

Silence stretched between them for what felt like an eternity. Nathaniel remained unmoved.

Gabrielle's voice trembled. "Nathaniel, you know the state of my family's company. If you pull out now, we're finished!"

The imposing figure stood silhouetted against the balcony lights. With practiced ease, he lit a cigarette, his gaze dropping to Gabrielle's desperate face.

"Grayson Enterprises isn't a charity," he stated flatly. "Your family business has been failing for years. Our investments have decreased annually. I tolerated it because of our friendship. But after tonight, that friendship no longer exists."

Gabrielle shook violently. "That's not true! How could you say that? We've known each other since childhood! You mean everything to me!"

Nathaniel's icy stare cut through the smoke. "Really? Then why do you keep targeting my wife?"

Guilt flashed across Gabrielle's face, quickly replaced by defiance. "Fine, we're friends. But Evelyn means nothing to me. She's arrogant and needed to be put in her place—"

"Do you honestly believe you have the right to discipline my wife?" Nathaniel's voice dropped dangerously. "Attacking her is attacking me."

Gabrielle recoiled as if struck.

Her hands clenched into fists. "I'm sorry, Nathaniel. I was wrong. I won't do it again. Please don't withdraw the funding."

"You endangered Evelyn's life." His voice was glacial. "Did you really think we'd remain friends after that?"

"Are you seriously choosing her over decades of friendship?" Gabrielle's voice cracked.

Nathaniel flicked ash from his cigarette with deliberate calm. "Count yourself lucky Evelyn is unharmed. If she so much as sneezes tomorrow, the consequences will make tonight's discussion seem merciful."

Gabrielle's blood ran cold. She'd never seen this ruthless side of Nathaniel before.

"Miss Winslow." The formal address struck like a slap. There would be no reconciliation.

"But Nathaniel—"

He crushed his cigarette and turned toward the door without another word.

Benjamin had tactfully excused himself earlier, leaving them alone. Now Gabrielle realized how final that gesture had been.

Panic set in. She couldn't lose everything. Not like this.

"Wait!" she screamed, lunging to block his path. "Answer me this—have you forgotten your promise to Amelia? Or are you just another man who discards the old for something new?"
###Chapter 231

Nathaniel's indifferent expression finally cracked at the mention of Amelia's name.

After a long silence, his eyes narrowed. "I haven't forgotten. I'll keep my promise to her."

Gabrielle scoffed. "Nathaniel, it doesn't matter if you no longer consider me a friend. But remember everything Amelia did for you. You can't betray her trust just because of Evelyn. She was a good woman!"

With that, Gabrielle turned and reached for the door.

That was when she saw Evelyn standing there.

Evelyn froze.

She had heard voices inside—Nathaniel and Gabrielle arguing. She had tried to slip past unnoticed, not wanting to seem like she was eavesdropping.

But fate had terrible timing.

Just as she passed the door, Gabrielle swung it open.

Now, it looked like she had been caught listening. No explanation would make this seem innocent.

Evelyn forced an awkward smile and waved. "Hey. Would you believe me if I said I was just walking by?"

Nathaniel and Gabrielle stared at her in silence.

Nathaniel's brow furrowed, his dark gaze piercing.

Gabrielle recovered first, smirking. She glanced back at Nathaniel. "I trust you'll keep your word. Amelia would believe in you too."

Then she stepped past Evelyn—but paused beside her.

In a whisper meant only for Evelyn's ears, she murmured, "Enjoy this while it lasts. Amelia is coming back soon. Then you'll finally see who truly matters to Nathaniel."

Evelyn's expression didn't waver.

Why would she care who mattered most to Nathaniel? It wasn't her business. And why should she dread Amelia's return? By then, her arrangement with Nathaniel would be over. They'd go their separate ways.

Gabrielle left.

Nathaniel stepped closer, his gaze dropping to Evelyn's damp hair. His frown deepened. "Where do you think you're going with your hair still wet?"

Evelyn sighed. Sophia had been blow-drying it for her earlier—until Benjamin showed up. So it was still slightly damp.

"Your niece and brother-in-law are arguing in our room. I needed fresh air. Thought I'd check on the poor bear while I was at it."

Brother-in-law?

If she was calling Benjamin that, she must have figured something out. Yet she brushed past it like it was nothing.

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed. "Evelyn. Is there something you want to ask me?"
###Chapter 232

Evelyn answered indifferently, "Nothing."

A complicated gleam flickered in Nathaniel's eyes.

Their gazes locked, tension thickening the air between them.

Abruptly, Nathaniel coughed into his fist, his face contorting in discomfort. Evelyn's brows knitted together.

"Sir, are you ill?"

Nathaniel waved her off with a scowl. "It's nothing."

She pressed two fingers to his wrist, feeling the erratic pulse beneath his skin. Her frown deepened.

The cave had been damp and freezing. Of course he'd caught a chill after giving her his jacket last night.

"You're running a fever. Sweat it out under extra blankets tonight—you'll feel better by morning."

"All that from taking my pulse?" Nathaniel studied her with renewed interest. He remembered how she'd diagnosed poison that time after Cassandra's cooking disaster.

Evelyn shrugged. "Basic diagnostics."

"Where'd you learn that?"

"Not formally." She tucked a stray lock behind her ear. "The convent where I grew up had a sister who practiced folk medicine. I picked up things watching her treat villagers."

"A convent?" Nathaniel's forehead creased. "Why were you there as a child?"

"My father—" Evelyn's voice hitched. She bit her lip.

The words tasted like ash. Sebastian's revelation about Gregory not being her real father still burned.

"My stepmother didn't want me around. They shipped me off to relatives, then foster families." Her laugh held no mirth. "I was the unwanted parcel everyone kept passing along. Eventually, they pooled money to dump me at that convent."

Nathaniel's chest constricted at her flippant delivery. His fingers twitched before threading through her hair in an uncharacteristic gesture.

"No one's sending you away again."

Evelyn shrugged him off with a brittle smile. "I don't need anyone's charity now. I go where I choose."

His jaw tightened.

Sometimes this infuriating woman had the emotional awareness of a brick.

"Sir, if you'll excuse me—" She turned toward the door, planning to visit the bear enclosure.

"You're excused—to bed." Nathaniel's command brooked no argument. He snagged her collar, steering her back toward their room.

The suite stood empty—Sophia and Benjamin must have taken their argument elsewhere.

Nathaniel locked the door and headed for the shower without another word.

Evelyn claimed the bed immediately. If they were maintaining this marital charade, she'd be damned if she slept on the couch. Within minutes, exhaustion pulled her into restless dreams.
###Chapter 233

The dream began where her childhood memories faded.

Feverish and weak in that hazy recollection, little Evelyn was taken to the hospital by her mother. As the IV dripped, her mother—after asking if she was hungry—promised to return with a steaming bowl of chicken noodle soup.

Before leaving, her mother paused at the door, tears glistening in her eyes as she gazed back at Evelyn.

But the face remained blurred. No matter how Evelyn strained her memory, her mother's features stayed just out of focus.

Then Gregory arrived. "I'm your father," he declared. "From now on, you're a Whitmore. Understand? Come. You're coming home with me."

Too young to recall her original surname—had it been her mother's?—all she remembered was the tender nickname: "Stardust." The day Gregory claimed her, "Evelyn Whitmore" became her identity.

At the convent, Mother Vivian remarked how cold the name sounded. "Luna means the moon—silver in alchemy. A lonely metal for a child already abandoned."

So Mother Vivian renamed her Evelyn, explaining it meant "life" and "light." She wanted the girl to be both radiant and resilient—a warrior cloaked in grace.

Most importantly, Mother Vivian warned: "Guard your heart. Never show your vulnerabilities. The world preys on the unprotected."

From then on, she was Evelyn Whitmore.

To her, Mother Vivian was the only warmth in a childhood starved of affection.

The dream twisted into a labyrinth. No matter how desperately she ran, exits vanished before her.

Sometimes Mother Vivian appeared, sorrow etched on her face. "Evelyn, New Capital City is dangerous alone. Trust no one—least of all men..."

Other times, her mother's voice floated through the maze. "Stardust, I'm just getting soup. I'll be back soon..."

She could see them—but never touch them.

Mother Vivian dissolved into shadows. Her mother walked away, strides quickening.

Evelyn sprinted after her, terror clawing her throat. Just as her fingers brushed her mother's sleeve—she plummeted into a well.

Darkness swallowed her. Above, someone slid a stone over the opening. Her screams died against the walls.

Then the water came.

It rose relentlessly, filling her lungs as she clawed at slick stones. Drowning. Suffocating. Dying—

Evelyn jolted awake. The bedroom was silent, bathed in moonlight. Just a nightmare.

Yet her mouth held the bitter aftertaste of tobacco.

Strange. She never smoked.

A rough grip tilted her chin. Lips captured hers, teeth grazing with possessive hunger.

Moonlight revealed the man looming over her.

Nathaniel.

He's... kissing me?! Her pulse exploded.
###Chapter 234

"Mmmph... Nathaniel...!"

Evelyn's eyes flew open as awareness crashed over her. Her body reacted before her mind could catch up - she shoved Nathaniel away with both hands.

She scrambled upright, chest heaving. "What the hell do you think you're doing?"

No response. Nathaniel simply rolled onto his side, his breathing deep and even.

Evelyn's brows knitted together.

'Was he asleep? Did he dream about some woman and accidentally kiss me instead?'

Her lips twisted in disgust as she wiped her mouth roughly with the back of her hand.

'Who said he could sleep in my bed anyway?'

Their unspoken arrangement was clear - one took the bed, the other the couch. If Nathaniel weren't sick tonight, she'd have kicked him out without hesitation.

Muttering curses under her breath, Evelyn finally calmed enough to study Nathaniel's face.

'He's sleeping so soundly... Could his cold have gotten worse?'

The dim moonlight made it hard to see clearly. After a moment's hesitation, she reached out to press her palm against his forehead.

'No fever. Good.'

Nathaniel lay still in his pajamas, no blanket covering him. Moonlight sculpted his sharp features into something almost ethereal.

That accidental kiss made looking at him feel... strange. Evelyn huffed and grabbed the discarded blanket, draping it over him.

One blanket didn't seem enough though. She fetched another from the wardrobe and carefully tucked both around him, hoping the extra layers would help him sweat out the cold.

Since she'd surrendered the bed due to his illness, the couch would be her resting place tonight.

She'd barely turned away when she heard fabric rustling. Both blankets lay in a heap on the floor again.

Nathaniel had shifted positions but remained fast asleep.

Evelyn's eye twitched. 'Grown men shouldn't kick blankets off like children!'

With a sigh, she retrieved the blankets and covered him once more before heading to the couch.

Not thirty seconds later - thump. The blankets were on the floor again.

This ridiculous cycle repeated until Evelyn's patience wore thin. She couldn't leave him uncovered - not with his cold. He'd wake up with a fever for sure.

Taking a deep breath, Evelyn made a decision. After replacing the blankets one final time, she climbed onto the bed and laid across Nathaniel, using her body weight to pin the blankets in place.

'Fine. I'll sleep like this then.'

It wasn't like either of them were drunk or drugged. Nothing would happen.

She told herself this was repayment for Nathaniel risking his life to save her from that cliff. A way to show gratitude for not abandoning her.

What she didn't see was the faint smirk curling Nathaniel's lips in the darkness.

Morning came.

Evelyn stretched as she woke, working out the kinks from her awkward sleeping position.

Nathaniel emerged from the bathroom, freshly showered. "Sleep well, Evelyn?"
###Chapter 235

Evelyn suddenly felt self-conscious and halted her stretch midway. The memory of Nathaniel's surprise kiss last night made her kick off the blankets in frustration.

"Not great," she muttered.

'He probably doesn't remember anything from last night since he was sleeping so deeply,' she thought with a scoff.

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed. "Really? When I woke up, you were smiling in your sleep. Must've been quite the dream."

Heat rushed to Evelyn's cheeks. It felt like he'd read her mind.

Truth be told, she had enjoyed pleasant dreams later that night.

Oddly enough, she'd fallen asleep quickly after pinning Nathaniel down to stop his blanket-kicking habit.

The dreams had been filled with gourmet desserts, playful puppies, and hilarious comedy sketches - a stark contrast to her earlier nightmare. Pure bliss.

"Has anyone ever told you it's creepy to watch people sleep?"

"No."

Evelyn stretched her lips into a thin line. "Consider this your first lesson. Personal space during sleep hours. No peeking."

Nathaniel calmly fastened his shirt buttons. "Didn't need to peek. Saw everything in sixty seconds flat. Including the drool reaching your ear."

Evelyn's mouth fell open. 'Damn him!'

She swallowed hard, instinctively wiping her cheek.

Nathaniel decided to ease up. "Time to rise. We've got the morning to enjoy before our afternoon departure."

"Right."

Evelyn scrambled off the bed, heading to the bathroom to fix her disheveled hair and scowl.

A faint smile touched Nathaniel's lips as he watched her stomp away. Waking up to her morning grumpiness every day didn't sound half bad.

After freshening up, they headed to the resort's dining area where Dominic's group was already eating.

Sophia spotted Evelyn immediately. "Over here!"

Evelyn hesitated, remembering their newlywed act. But Nathaniel simply ruffled her hair. "Go ahead."

She practically skipped to Sophia's table.

Nathaniel watched her settle in before taking his own seat with practiced elegance.

Sophia leaned in excitedly. "Eat fast! We're flying kites after breakfast."

Evelyn took a bite of her sandwich. "No more horseback riding?"

Sophia shot Gabrielle a pointed look. "After yesterday's incident, Dominic banned us girls from the stables. But they've got kites we can use until lunch."

Evelyn sipped her milk. "Haven't flown a kite in ages."

"Same!" Sophia grinned. "Last time was senior year. Unlike some people still stuck in high school."

Benjamin's face darkened. "Watch it, Sophia Bennett. I was leaving you alone today."
###Chapter 236

Sophia Bennett burst into laughter, clutching her stomach as her head tilted back in amusement. "Was I talking about you? I didn't name anyone specifically. Why assume it's about you?"

Benjamin's eyes flashed with irritation. "You—"

Before tensions could escalate, Evelyn Whitmore intervened. "Enough. Focus on your breakfast. No talking while eating—you might choke."

Sophia nodded obediently, falling silent immediately. Benjamin, however, shot Evelyn a defiant glare before stabbing his fork into the omelet with unnecessary force.

Across the table, Gabrielle Winslow observed everything with venomous intensity. How had this seemingly innocent girl bewitched Nathaniel Grayson and tamed the notoriously spoiled Sophia? Even rebellious Benjamin followed her lead now.

This was unacceptable.

Evelyn appeared harmless, but Gabrielle realized too late—she was dealing with a far more dangerous opponent than anticipated.

The afternoon sun painted the sky in brilliant blue, ideal for their planned kite-flying. Evelyn held up a swallow-shaped kite while Sophia sprinted across the field, the line unraveling behind her. Within moments, the kite soared upward, dancing among the clouds.

Their laughter carried on the breeze as they worked together to extend the string further. The joy between them was palpable.

Gabrielle approached then, clutching a butterfly kite with feigned helplessness. "Sophia, darling, could you assist me? I can't seem to get mine airborne."

Sophia's smile vanished instantly. She turned with a scowl. "Can't you see I'm busy? Figure it out yourself!"

Gabrielle's pleasant mask faltered. "I—"

Evelyn glanced up from untangling the string. "Miss Winslow, I can hold your kite if you'd like to run with it."

Gabrielle's eyes narrowed in suspicion. "You'd help me? Really?"

Evelyn shrugged. "Believe what you want." There was no point pretending after yesterday's confrontation.

With a contemptuous sniff, Gabrielle stalked away without another word.

Sophia huffed. "Why bother with her after what she did?"

Evelyn's gaze followed Gabrielle's retreating figure. "She's planning something. Playing along makes it easier to anticipate her moves."

"Planning what? Hasn't she done enough damage already?" Sophia protested.

Gabrielle positioned herself far from the others, determined to succeed alone. She ran, the kite lifting briefly before crashing down. Undeterred, she tried again—only to trip spectacularly moments later.

A sharp cry pierced the air as she crumpled to the grass, clutching her ankle dramatically. "Help! Someone, please!"

Nathaniel's friend Dominic Prescott was the first to notice. "Nathaniel, Benjamin—we've got a situation over there."
###Chapter 237

Nathaniel and the group swiftly galloped toward Gabrielle's location.

Gabrielle sat crumpled on the grass. Her bare legs, exposed by the shorts she wore, were crisscrossed with angry red scratches and smears of blood.

The men arrived within moments.

Benjamin dismounted first, rushing to her side. "Gabrielle! What happened?" His voice cracked with concern.

Tears welled in Gabrielle's eyes as she whimpered, "Benjamin... I fell while trying to launch the kite. My ankle—I think it's sprained. The pain is unbearable..."

Kneeling beside her, Benjamin inspected her injuries with growing alarm. "How could you be so reckless?"

Nearby, Sophia observed the scene with undisguised contempt. "You were right, Evelyn," she muttered. "She's scheming again. Honestly, how difficult is it to stand up after a fall? And screaming for help? Only a fool like Benjamin would buy this act!"

Evelyn calmly held the kite string. "Let's go see what's happening."

As the trip organizer, Dominic dismounted and approached. "Gabrielle, can you stand?"

Gabrielle shook her head, tears now streaming down her face. "Dominic, I'm so foolish. I couldn't even fly a simple kite by myself..."

Dominic frowned. "Why were you attempting it alone?"

Benjamin echoed the question, his brow furrowed. "Yes, why didn't you ask for assistance?"

Gabrielle lowered her gaze with a resigned sigh. "I approached Evelyn and Sophia, but they ignored me. Perhaps Evelyn still resents me after yesterday's misunderstanding and told Sophia not to help." She sniffled dramatically. "I envy how easily they flew their kite together. If Celeste were here, I wouldn't be so alone..."

With calculated precision, she painted Evelyn and Sophia as cruel bullies.

At the mention of his missing sister, Benjamin's expression softened with guilt. His earlier suspicions about Gabrielle's motives faded beneath a wave of sympathy.

Sophia stormed forward, hands on hips. "That's a lie, Uncle Nathaniel! Evelyn offered to help, but Gabrielle refused and glared at her!"

Gabrielle's eyes reddened as she addressed Sophia with fragile dignity. "Sophia, I know you're protecting Evelyn, but twisting the truth to defend her isn't right. Why else would I be here alone, injured, if not ignored by you both?"

Sophia recoiled in disgust. "Unbelievable! Of all the mysteries in this world, you're the most baffling—a woman who lies without blinking!"

"I made mistakes yesterday," Gabrielle sobbed, leaning heavily against Benjamin's shoulder. "But today I speak the truth!"

Nathaniel, still mounted, observed the scene silently before shifting his gaze between the furious Sophia and the composed Evelyn standing nearby.

His voice cut sharply through the tension. "Benjamin, help her onto her horse."
###Chapter 238

Benjamin nodded and helped Gabrielle, who was leaning against him in tears, to stand up.

Gabrielle wiped her eyes and tried to steady herself with Benjamin's support, but her right leg gave out. A sharp pain shot through her, turning her face from pale to sickly green. Beads of sweat formed on her forehead. This wasn’t an act—she was genuinely hurt.

Benjamin’s heart ached seeing her in such pain.

"Gabrielle, you could’ve just asked me to fly the kite with you if no one else wanted to. Why push yourself like this?"

Gritting her teeth, Gabrielle managed a weak smile. "Nathaniel, you’re a man. Flying a kite is too childish for you. Besides… I thought I could handle it. Turns out, I overestimated myself. Stupid, right?"

Benjamin sighed deeply and adjusted Gabrielle’s arm over his shoulder. "Enough. Let’s get you back to the resort. The doctor needs to check your leg. If it’s a bone injury, it could affect your performance."

He signaled Dominic to help. Together, they lifted Gabrielle onto the horse. Benjamin then took the reins and led the way back, walking briskly toward the resort.

Dominic and the others followed, their expressions tense. Gabrielle’s condition looked serious, and they hoped it wouldn’t cause lasting damage.

Nathaniel remained where he was, still mounted on his horse. He glanced down at Evelyn and Sophia. "Put the kite away. Be careful."

Sophia huffed. "It’s not like we’re going to fall. Ugh. Why does something always go wrong when Gabrielle’s around? I just wanted to enjoy flying the kite!"

Evelyn handed the reel to Sophia and gave her shoulder a reassuring squeeze. "It’s okay. We can try again another time."

Sophia sighed dramatically. "Guess we don’t have a choice."

Nathaniel nudged his horse forward, stopping beside Evelyn. "Evelyn," he called.

She looked up. "Yes?"

He leaned down, extending his hand. "Give me your hand."

Evelyn hesitated. "Why?"

His brow furrowed. "You’re riding back with me. Unless you’d rather walk?"

She shook her head. "I’ll wait for Sophia."

Nathaniel’s expression darkened.

Sophia, still wrestling with the kite, smirked. "Don’t wait for me, Evelyn! I’m keeping this up a little longer!"

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "Then I’ll stay with you."

Sophia waved her off. "No need!"

As she spoke, the reel spun wildly, the kite soaring higher. All her effort was wasted.

Finally regaining control, Sophia chuckled. "This might take a while. Go ahead with Uncle Nathaniel."

Evelyn knew Sophia was trying to create an opportunity, but she couldn’t explain that she didn’t need it. Reluctantly, she sighed. "Fine. Be careful with the string."

Sophia grinned. "Got it!"

With that, Evelyn reached for Nathaniel’s hand, his grip firm and warm.

He pulled her up effortlessly, settling her in front of him on the saddle. The closeness was… strange. She could feel the solid warmth of his chest against her back.

"Sir, aren’t you in a hurry to check on your dear friend Gabrielle?"

"I’m not a doctor," Nathaniel replied flatly. "Being there won’t help."

Evelyn forced a smile. "Fair point."

Silence stretched between them.

Then, abruptly, she asked, "What’s your horse’s name?"

"Celestial Pursuit."

Celestial Pursuit? Like… chasing the stars?
###Chapter 239

The name of Nathaniel's horse had a celestial theme. Was that star a reference to his beloved, Celeste Rivers?

Chasing the stars, chasing the one who held his heart...

Nathaniel leaned close to Evelyn's ear when he noticed her distracted expression. "What's on your mind?"

Evelyn snapped back to reality, running her fingers through the horse's mane. "Nothing. It's a magnificent horse."

"You enjoy riding?"

She shrugged. "It's decent."

Without warning, Nathaniel's hand settled on her waist, his breath warm against her ear. "This trip wasn't fun for you. Next time, we'll come alone."

Evelyn stiffened. Is he delusional? The contract expires in two months. There won't be a 'next time' for us.

His fingers traced her waistline, as if inspecting fine silk. "You eat so much, yet you're still this slender," he teased.

Evelyn scowled. "Not my problem."

Nathaniel chuckled. "Eat more. A little softness would feel better in my hands."

Heat rushed to her cheeks as she swatted his hand away. "Control yourself. Hands off!"

"Keep squirming, and I'll show you just how little control I have."

Evelyn gritted her teeth. Riding double with him had been a terrible idea.

Back at Silver Peaks Ranch, Gabrielle and the others had gathered in her room.

Nathaniel and Evelyn arrived to find a crowd hovering around Gabrielle's bed while a doctor examined her injury.

After a thorough check, the doctor's expression turned grave. "She needs immediate surgery. Without proper equipment here, I can't confirm the extent, but based on symptoms—her ligament is likely torn."

Torn ligament?

Gabrielle's face was ghostly pale, but she forced herself upright. "Doctor... will I still be able to dance?"

The doctor hesitated. "With recovery, yes. But your flexibility may never be the same."

Her eyes widened in horror. "I'm a principal ballerina! If I can't perform perfectly, what's the point of living?"

"Gabrielle, don't panic," Benjamin soothed. "Let's get you to the hospital first. The damage might not be permanent."

Dominic nodded, already calling for an ambulance.

Gabrielle trembled, tears streaming as she fumbled for her phone. The call connected.

"Celeste... I can't do this anymore," she whispered hoarsely. "If there's another life... let's be sisters again. Goodbye—"

The phone slipped from her fingers as she collapsed, unconscious.

Benjamin grabbed her shoulders, shaking her frantically. "Gabrielle! Wake up! Doctor—!"

The doctor checked her pulse. "She's fine. The pain and emotional distress caused her to faint. But she needs a hospital immediately."

A sudden ringtone cut through the tension. Benjamin paled at the caller ID but answered swiftly. "Amelia, I'm with Gabrielle! She's hurt, but it's not life-threatening!"

His voice softened. "Don't worry. I've got her. Oh—Nathaniel's here too. Yes."

Turning, he extended the phone toward Nathaniel. "My sister wants to speak with you."
###Chapter 240

Nathaniel didn't hesitate. He took the phone from Benjamin and strode out of the room to take the call.

Evelyn watched him leave, her brow arching in contemplation.

Dominic returned from arranging hospital transport. "The ambulance is on its way. Gabrielle will get proper treatment soon."

Benjamin squeezed Gabrielle's limp hand. "Did you hear that? Help's coming. You'll be fine!"

No response.

The doctor checked Gabrielle's pulse and massaged her temples. She stirred with a pained groan.

Though conscious now, her eyes held a hollow emptiness. "My dancing career is over. Why bother saving me? Just let me—"

"Don't say that," Benjamin interrupted. "You're Celeste's closest friend. She'd be devastated seeing you like this."

At the mention of Celeste, Gabrielle's eyes flickered with life before dimming again. "Celeste... the only one who ever truly cared."

Benjamin insisted, "We all care about you. Right, Dominic?"

Dominic offered a faint smile. "Absolutely. Focus on recovery first. With the right physical therapy, you could regain mobility. The ballet world still needs its star."

Gabrielle shook her head weakly. "Stop lying to me. The doctor said I'll never dance again."

Dominic fell silent, unequipped to handle such despair.

The door creaked open. Lucas entered.

"Miss Winslow," he announced formally, "after reconsideration, Mr. Grayson has postponed withdrawing his investment. The final decision will wait until next quarter's financial report. For now, focus on healing."

Color returned to Gabrielle's cheeks. "Truly?"

Lucas nodded. "Direct orders from Mr. Grayson himself."

Tears welled in Gabrielle's eyes. "I knew... I knew Nathaniel still valued our friendship. Please thank him for me. Tell him my family won't disappoint him when those reports come."

"Of course," Lucas acknowledged.

His gaze swept the room before landing on Evelyn, who'd positioned herself inconspicuously in the corner. Approaching her, he said respectfully, "Ms. Whitmore, Mr. Grayson instructed me to escort you and Miss Bennett home."

Evelyn met his eyes calmly. "What about him?"

"He's still occupied with the call. Someone requested he stay with Miss Winslow until treatment arrives. He said not to wait."

Still on the phone?
###Chapter 241

"Is he still on the phone with his precious darling?"

Evelyn knew exactly who Nathaniel was taking orders from—it couldn't be anyone other than Amelia. Delaying the divestment from the Winslows was clearly a courtesy extended toward her.

It made perfect sense and shouldn't surprise anyone.

After a brief pause, Evelyn turned to Lucas. "I'll go with you, but could you wait a moment?"

"Wait? For what?" Lucas frowned in confusion. "May I ask how long and why, ma'am?"

Evelyn's expression remained composed as she answered, "Until I settle things with Gabrielle."

Lucas grew even more perplexed. A sense of unease crept over him, but before he could inquire further, Evelyn was already walking toward Gabrielle, who lay injured on the bed.

The moment Evelyn approached, Benjamin immediately stood up, positioning himself protectively in front of Gabrielle. "What do you think you're doing?" he demanded.

Evelyn's expression softened, her tone laced with apology. "Her injury isn't entirely my fault, but I do bear some responsibility. My stubborn refusal to help her fly a kite led to her fall. I should take accountability for that."

Benjamin's defensive stance relaxed slightly at Evelyn's admission. His guard lowered, though his brows remained furrowed in conflict. "You don't need to blame yourself. It wasn't solely your doing."

Truthfully, Evelyn bore little responsibility for Gabrielle's accident. Benjamin had seen Evelyn and Sophia flying their kite in the distance when it happened. Besides, given what Gabrielle had done to Evelyn, her reluctance to assist was understandable.

Gabrielle, however, silently cursed Benjamin for his stupidity. Anyone with half a brain could see Evelyn was up to something—the proper response should've been keeping his guard up against her hidden agenda!

Feigning exaggerated pain, Gabrielle sneered, "Don't bother, Evelyn. You're not responsible for my injury. You had every right to refuse helping me. I don't blame you—only my own bad luck..."

Evelyn stepped past Benjamin toward the bed. Meeting Gabrielle's pained expression, she insisted firmly, "But I must."

Gabrielle's frown deepened as she eyed Evelyn warily. A pitiful look of helplessness crossed her face. "Didn't I already say—"
###Chapter 242

Evelyn examined Gabrielle's swollen foot with clinical precision. "That's not a ligament tear," she stated matter-of-factly. "Just a bone displacement from the sprain. I can reset it without surgery if you'll let me."

Gabrielle's tear-streaked face twisted in disbelief. "Not torn? Don't be absurd, Evelyn! Are you saying the ER doctors got it wrong?" Her voice cracked with pain and indignation. "Since when did you get a medical degree?"

Without waiting for permission, Evelyn moved toward the foot of the hospital bed. Her fingers barely grazed Gabrielle's ankle when the injured woman jerked away violently, crying out from the sudden movement.

"Don't touch me!" Gabrielle gasped, clutching the sheets. "Benjamin, stop her!"

Benjamin snapped out of his daze and stepped between them. "She's scared enough without you making it worse," he said, though his voice lacked conviction. The memory of Evelyn saving his life still weighed on him.

Evelyn locked eyes with Benjamin, her gaze unwavering. "I'm serious. One adjustment and she'll be walking normally." She tilted her head. "Don't you want to see your precious Gabrielle healed?"

Something in her certainty made Benjamin hesitate. He turned to Gabrielle. "Maybe we should—"

"Are you insane?" Gabrielle shrieked, her face flushing with anger. "Look at what she's done to me already!"

Evelyn had no patience for theatrics. She shoved Benjamin forward. "Hold her down," she ordered.

Before anyone could react, Benjamin found himself pinning Gabrielle's thrashing limbs to the bed. Evelyn seized the injured ankle and with two sharp twists and an audible pop, it was over.

Gabrielle's scream could have shattered glass.

The room erupted into chaos as everyone rushed forward. Evelyn stepped back calmly, producing a tissue to meticulously clean each finger.

Benjamin helped a sobbing Gabrielle sit up. "Can you move it?" he asked urgently.

"I can't feel anything!" Gabrielle wailed, fresh tears streaming down her face. "She's crippled me! Are you happy now?"

Benjamin whirled on Evelyn, fury darkening his features. "You said you could help her!"

Evelyn ignored him, tossing the used tissue aside. Then, with deliberate nonchalance, she pulled something small and fuzzy from her pocket and flung it at Gabrielle.

The object landed in Gabrielle's lap mid-sob. She looked down—and screamed bloody murder, leaping off the bed with surprising agility to hide behind Benjamin. "A rat! Get it away!"

Benjamin stood frozen, not at the sight of the rodent, but at the realization that Gabrielle had just jumped three feet on her "crippled" foot.
###Chapter 243

Benjamin strode forward and picked up the fuzzy object on the bed, grimacing when he realized it was a revolting fake rat. "Relax, Gabrielle! It's not real."

What kind of twisted hobby does Evelyn have? Who carries something like this around, let alone plays pranks at a time like this? And to scare Gabrielle when her foot was numb—Wait. Did Gabrielle just leap off the bed?!

His eyes widened in disbelief. "Gabrielle! Your foot—is it okay now?"

Gabrielle froze, her mind blanking. Only then did she register that she was standing perfectly fine—no pain, no limp. Damn it! I reacted too fast! Now the act is ruined.

The guilt and embarrassment on her face vanished, replaced by exaggerated delight. "Oh my—my foot! It's healed! That's incredible!"

Though the initial pain from Evelyn's adjustments had been excruciating, the discomfort had faded completely afterward. Still, she'd pretended to faint—anything to keep Evelyn from getting credit.

But she hadn't counted on Evelyn pulling such a dirty trick.

Now, everyone was staring at Evelyn in awe, even the ranch doctor looking impressed.

Desperate to salvage her image, Gabrielle rushed to Evelyn, throwing her arms around her dramatically. "You really can fix dislocated bones! You're amazing! Thank you so much! Now I won't have to worry about my dancing career!"

Then, under her breath, she hissed, "You won this round, Evelyn."

Evelyn smirked, leaning in to whisper, "Flattery won't save you. I deal with schemers like you every day."

Gabrielle's smile tightened. "Don't get cocky. Do you really think you've won just because Nathaniel pulled funding from my family? One call from Amelia, and he'll change his mind instantly. It's obvious who matters more to him."

Evelyn shrugged. "Oh, I know. Your precious Amelia is his entire world."

"Exactly," Gabrielle sneered. "So stop wasting your time trying to seduce him. You'll never compare to her."

Evelyn arched a brow. "You're the one staging these ridiculous stunts. I couldn't care less about competing with Amelia for Nathaniel's heart. But you? You're willing to risk your career just to make him hate me. Lucky for you, it was just a sprain. What if you'd snapped a ligament? Would that have been worth it?"

Gabrielle smirked. "I'd sacrifice anything for Amelia's happiness. What's it to you?"

Evelyn sighed. As twisted as Gabrielle was, her loyalty was undeniable. Whoever Amelia was, she was lucky to have a friend willing to go this far for her.
###Chapter 244

Dominic strolled over with an easy grin, eyeing the two women curiously. "What's this secret conversation happening during a hug?"

Gabrielle finally released Evelyn, turning to flash Dominic a practiced smile.

"Nathaniel, I was just thanking Evelyn for fixing my ankle. Got a little carried away with gratitude, I suppose!"

Her gaze flicked back to Evelyn, feigning concern. "I didn't startle you, did I?"

"Not at all."

Evelyn's expression remained unreadable. She brushed invisible lint off her shoulder where Gabrielle had touched her, as if wiping away something distasteful.

Dominic's eyes sparkled with amusement as he studied Evelyn. "Didn't expect my new sister-in-law to have such impressive skills. Who taught you?"

Gabrielle's jaw tightened at the affectionate term. She cut in before Evelyn could respond.

"Evelyn must've learned early, growing up in the countryside. Kids there mature fast—unlike us city girls who were pampered."

Her words dripped with false humility, thinly veiling the jab at Evelyn's background.

Evelyn caught the insult but merely smirked.

Dominic's playful demeanor hardened. "Since you're healed, Gabrielle, no need for the ambulance." He pulled out his phone and tossed it to her. "First number in the log is the doctor I contacted. Explain your miraculous recovery yourself."

Gabrielle fumbled with the phone, forcing a laugh. "Right, of course. Wouldn't want to waste medical resources."

Dominic didn't spare her another glance. His attention shifted back to Evelyn, admiration gleaming in his eyes.

He nudged her shoulder playfully. "Confession—I've got an old wrist injury that never fully healed. Since we're practically family now, how about fixing me up too?"

The gesture was brotherly, devoid of any inappropriate undertones.

Evelyn arched a brow, eyeing his arm on her shoulder. "You really want my help?"

Dominic caught the warning in her sharp gaze and immediately withdrew, chuckling. "Okay, okay! I surrender. Just don't make me regret asking."

"Smart move," Evelyn deadpanned.

Dominic clicked his tongue. "Careful, or I'll tell Nathaniel to drag you home and—" He paused dramatically. "—spank some manners into you."

Evelyn's cheeks flushed at the implication.

Dominic grinned, thoroughly enjoying her reaction.
###Chapter 245

Did Dominic just threaten to spank me?

Evelyn wrinkled her nose in disgust. "How childish!"

Gabrielle had just finished her call with the doctor when she turned to see Dominic and Evelyn chatting together, laughing like old friends. Their easy camaraderie made her blood boil.

Dominic wasn't usually this open with strangers. In fact, he had a reputation for being sharp-tongued with people he considered beneath him. The fact that he was joking so freely with Evelyn meant he genuinely saw her as family - like a little sister.

This couldn't be happening. If Dominic saw Evelyn as a sister, what did that make Amelia?

Gabrielle's mind raced with schemes to turn everyone against Evelyn when a soft knock interrupted her thoughts.

All eyes turned to the suite's entrance where a staff member from Silver Peaks Ranch stood waiting. The woman wore crisp overalls bearing the resort's logo.

With a polite bow, the staff member approached Gabrielle directly. "Miss Winslow," she said respectfully, presenting a bill. "Here's your total expenses for this visit. We'd appreciate payment at your earliest convenience."

Gabrielle's face darkened. "Who told you to come to me for payment?"

The staff member blinked in confusion. "Our front desk received instructions that you'd be settling the bill today, Miss Winslow. If now isn't convenient, we can arrange payment upon checkout."

Someone had specifically requested she pay? Gabrielle snatched the invoice, her frown deepening. "$1,800? That's ridiculous! We've never spent this much before!"

The staff member explained patiently, "This includes an advance payment for your upcoming reservation, Miss Winslow."

"Reservation? What reservation?"

"Yesterday, someone booked three days at Silver Peaks next month under your name. They ordered three whole roasted lambs and several premium dishes, requesting everything be charged to your account today."

Gabrielle's jaw dropped. "Three days? I never authorized this! Go find whoever made that reservation - I'm not paying for it!"

The staff member paled. "But we've already secured the lambs from local farmers and purchased expensive ingredients based on that order. Canceling now would cause significant losses..."

Gabrielle's voice turned icy. "Who dared spend my money without permission?"

Evelyn stepped forward. "I made the reservation."
###Chapter 246

Gabrielle's jaw dropped as she glared at Evelyn with undisguised disdain. "So it's you, Evelyn! Is this because you'll be hosting everyone next month for three days? Trying to make up for yesterday?"

Evelyn gave a slight nod. "Exactly. My treat."

Gabrielle let out a mocking laugh. "That makes zero sense. Why would I pay for your so-called 'treat'? That's ridiculous."

Evelyn remained unshaken, her expression calm.

"Miss Gabrielle, did you forget your promise? Yesterday you swore that if I proved I didn't plant that earring in your shoe, you'd cover everyone's expenses for the day. Having second thoughts now? Not keeping your word?"

Gabrielle froze.

She'd completely forgotten about that!

When she'd made the promise, she'd estimated their group's spending wouldn't exceed a thousand dollars at most.

Suddenly the bill had skyrocketed to eighteen hundred!

That wasn't pocket change for anyone - she could buy a designer handbag with that money!

"Evelyn, I promised to cover yesterday's expenses. But you booked next month's event separately. Those three days shouldn't be lumped into yesterday's bill!"

Evelyn didn't respond directly. Instead, she turned to the staff. "Excuse me, does yesterday's order count toward yesterday's expenses? Any issues with that?"

The staff member bowed respectfully. "Correct. Your booking from yesterday, along with the receipt and charges, were all recorded under yesterday's account. Settling them together now is perfectly reasonable."

Gabrielle's face darkened at the explanation but she stayed silent.

Evelyn smiled faintly. "I wanted to treat everyone properly yesterday, but thanks to Miss Gabrielle's little stunt, we couldn't enjoy ourselves at all."

"Since I didn't get to host properly, I booked three days next month to make it up to everyone. If Gabrielle won't pay, I'll cover it myself."

She pulled out her phone - actually Nathaniel's - ready to pay from his account.

No way was she spending her own money on these people. Using her husband's funds for his friends was only fair.

Gabrielle stiffened, then forced a smile. "Oh, you misunderstood! Of course I'll pay this trifling amount. You're right - I ruined everyone's fun yesterday. It's only fair I make it up next month!"

"Amelia should be back by then too! We haven't seen each other in ages - perfect timing for a reunion! Let me handle the bill now!"

She deliberately mentioned Amelia's return, hoping to unsettle Evelyn.

But Evelyn just smiled carefreely. "Great. We'll let Miss Gabrielle take care of it then."

Gabrielle retrieved her wallet and handed a card to the staff. "No PIN needed."

The staff bowed and left to process payment.

Gabrielle turned back with a saccharine smile. "Honestly, it's not that expensive, Evelyn. Just a few thousand - pocket change for people like us. You're probably not used to this level of spending, are you? That's why it seems wasteful to you."

Her polite words carried a clear message: Evelyn was the odd one out, the poor outsider.
###Chapter 247

Evelyn didn't blush with embarrassment. Instead, she nodded matter-of-factly. "You're right. This lifestyle isn't familiar to me. I don't usually waste money on frivolous entertainment. I prefer being practical with my spending."

Gabrielle let out a light laugh, her aristocratic gaze sweeping over Evelyn with thinly veiled condescension. "Different values, darling. You'll adapt eventually. People like us—wealthy, privileged—have nothing better to do than indulge ourselves. Spending money is our entertainment."

Evelyn's expression remained neutral. "How... fascinating."

"You should stay with us more often," Gabrielle continued, her tone dripping with false generosity. "Otherwise, how will you ever fit into Nathaniel's world? He was raised with silver spoons, not... whatever background you come from."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Maybe he should learn some humility instead. The man could use less arrogance and extravagance."

The room went silent.

Dominic choked back a laugh, elbowing Harrison beside him. Now this was a woman with spine.

The others exchanged glances, their expressions shifting with newfound respect. No one dared speak about Nathaniel Grayson that way—except her.

What none of them noticed was Nathaniel standing frozen at the doorway, his sharp features darkening as her words registered.

Arrogant? Extravagant?

His little wife had some nerve.

Gabrielle recovered first, her smile turning patronizing. "Oh Evelyn, you're hilarious. Change Nathaniel? Impossible. The Graysons don't adapt to others—others adapt to them. That's how elite society works."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "I wasn't joking. If anyone needs adjusting, it's your warped values. Spoiled rich kids like you turn vanity into virtue. My values are just fine, thanks."

The air turned icy.

Gabrielle's smile stiffened. "How... provincial. With that attitude, your marriage won't last. Shared values matter among our kind."

Evelyn almost laughed. Their "marriage" had an expiration date anyway.

Then a deep voice cut through the tension like a blade. "My wife's values are none of your concern."

Nathaniel stepped forward, his presence commanding immediate silence. No anger colored his tone—just quiet, dangerous finality.
###Chapter 248

Nathaniel strode in deliberately, tossing the phone back to Benjamin.

His piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn. Approaching her, he reached out with unexpected tenderness, tucking a stray lock behind her ear. "Even when we disagree, we can find common ground while respecting our differences."

Evelyn froze.

'Common ground while respecting differences'?

Hearing such diplomatic words from this notoriously ruthless man sent chills down her spine.

Recovering, her lips twitched involuntarily. Had he overheard her earlier remarks? Was this his version of anger?

Gabrielle's face mirrored shock at Nathaniel's description of his relationship with Evelyn. Swallowing her disbelief, she forced a nervous chuckle. "Nathaniel, I was merely teasing Evelyn!"

Nathaniel shifted his imposing frame to stand protectively beside Evelyn, his expression darkening. "Tasteless jokes aren't amusing."

Gabrielle's smile faltered. "I...I only thought someone with Evelyn's rural upbringing would appreciate casual humor. Evelyn, you're not upset, are you?"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. Gabrielle's faux concern thinly veiled another insult. Reacting would only paint her as the unreasonable one.

As she prepared a retort, Nathaniel's strong hands settled on her shoulders, applying subtle pressure - a silent command to remain silent.

"My wife's country upbringing," Nathaniel stated coolly, "gave her honesty and kindness. These virtues aren't licenses for others to take advantage."

Evelyn blinked up at him in surprise.

Gabrielle backpedaled frantically. "That's not what I meant! After she treated my injury, I only wanted to help her adapt to our social circle—"

"Unnecessary." Nathaniel's icy dismissal cut through her excuses.

Turning to Evelyn, his lips curved slightly. "My wife requires no alterations. It's I who must adjust to her influence. Isn't that right, Mrs. Grayson?"

Evelyn studied him warily. Why this sudden performative affection? It set her teeth on edge.

Gabrielle's smile turned brittle, her eyes shooting daggers at Evelyn beneath lowered lashes.

Nathaniel traced Evelyn's cheekbone with unexpected gentleness. "Didn't I instruct Lucas to escort you home? Why linger here involving yourself in others' affairs?"

Evelyn lowered her gaze. "Right. I'll leave now." She stepped free of his embrace. "Mr. Sinclair, we should go."

Lucas glanced uncertainly at his employer before nodding. "Yes, ma'am."

Nathaniel's expression soured as Evelyn walked away without backward glance.

Then—she paused.

His eyes brightened imperceptibly.
###Chapter 249

Did this little troublemaker really just forget to say goodbye to him?

Evelyn turned with a smirk playing on her lips. "My apologies for costing you a grand, Miss Gabrielle. I nearly forgot to bid you farewell as well."

Nathaniel's expression darkened instantly.

Gabrielle blinked, sensing the underlying threat in Evelyn's words but forced a polite smile under everyone's watchful gaze. "Oh, don't mention it, Evelyn!"

With deliberate grace, Evelyn closed the distance between them. Their embrace appeared warm to onlookers, but her whisper carried ice. "Let me clarify something - I never asked Nathaniel to withdraw his investments. I didn't even know about them until today. You brought this upon yourself."

Her grip tightened imperceptibly. "If I seek revenge, I'll do it personally. No need to involve Nathaniel. And trust me, my methods will be far more... creative than anything he'd do."

The final words dripped with menace. "Cross me again, and you won't live to regret it."

Gabrielle's blood ran cold.

When the shock faded, rage took its place. Her smile turned brittle, teeth grinding behind closed lips. She couldn't retaliate - not with an audience watching.

Now she understood. Evelyn's three-day venue reservation wasn't about compensation. It was pure retaliation.

Eighteen hundred dollars might be pocket change to her image, but the waste stung. That money could've bought a limited-edition designer piece. Instead, it vanished into thin air because of this insolent girl!

How dare Evelyn threaten her?

As if some country nobody could touch a Winslow heiress!

Gabrielle scoffed internally. Evelyn overestimated herself. Yes, the girl had skills, but against old money and connections? Impossible.

The Winslow name carried weight even in their current slump. Every strand of Gabrielle's hair held more value than Evelyn's entire existence!

Just wait until Amelia returned. Nathaniel would drop Evelyn like yesterday's news. Without his protection, that arrogant facade would crumble.

Reality would teach Evelyn her proper place - beneath Gabrielle's designer heels.

After delivering her warning, Evelyn strolled past Nathaniel without so much as a glance.

The storm brewing on Nathaniel's face was priceless.

Dominic couldn't resist. With a teasing grin, he slung an arm around Nathaniel's shoulders. "Looks like your wife's giving you the cold shoulder, Nate!"

Nathaniel shrugged him off with a glare and turned to leave, only to find Benjamin blocking his path.

"Tell me," Benjamin demanded, voice tight with concern. "What did my sister say on the phone? Did she mention when she's coming back?"
###Chapter 250

Nathaniel glanced at Benjamin. His gaze lingered on Evelyn, who stood with her back turned near the suite door. "Nothing," he replied curtly.

Benjamin sighed heavily. "Amelia keeps promising she'll return soon, but it's been months! Ever since she left, no one treats me right—especially my brother. He criticizes me constantly!"

"If you're that concerned, call her yourself."

"No. She needs time to recover abroad. I won't pressure her."

Nathaniel closed his eyes, his expression unreadable. "Since Gabrielle's injury has healed, escort her home safely. Consider it doing your sister a favor."

Benjamin nodded obediently. "Understood. Where are you heading now?"

"Home." Nathaniel turned to leave without another word.

"Wait!" Gabrielle rushed after him, desperation in her voice. "Nathaniel, please wait!"

He didn't pause or look back, his strides steady and purposeful.

Gabrielle clenched her fists, frustration flashing across her face.

Benjamin frowned. "You should call Amelia yourself. Let her know you're fine so she stops worrying."

Gabrielle forced a smile. "Don't worry, I'll contact her."

When Evelyn emerged from the hotel lobby with her luggage, Lucas already had the car waiting.

Sophia followed closely behind, her own suitcase in tow.

They handed their bags to Lucas for loading. Sophia moved to open the backseat door—and froze.

Nathaniel sat inside, laptop balanced on his knees, absorbed in work emails.

Sophia blinked in confusion. "Uncle Nathaniel? Lucas said you had urgent business and wouldn't be joining us."

His gaze flicked upward briefly. "Plans changed."

Those dark eyes swept past her, lingering momentarily on Evelyn before returning to his screen.

"Oh!" Sophia stepped back hastily. "Evelyn, you should sit here—right next to Uncle Nathaniel!"

Evelyn shook her head. "After you."

"Nonsense! Take the middle seat."

"I prefer the window. Helps with motion sickness."

Sophia finally understood and climbed in, leaving the window seat vacant.

Nathaniel's fingers stilled on the keyboard.

Motion sickness? She'd been perfectly fine during the trip here. This was clearly an excuse to avoid sitting beside him.

The car wound through mountain roads.

Sophia regretted her seating choice immediately. The atmosphere grew unbearably tense.

Neither Nathaniel nor Evelyn spoke a word. An invisible storm brewed around Nathaniel, though no one had provoked him.

Sophia sighed internally. She should've entered from Nathaniel's side instead. Now she was trapped between two silent storms.

Too late for regrets.

Evelyn plugged in earphones and closed her eyes, shutting out the world.

For two hours, not a single word passed between her and Nathaniel.
###Chapter 251

Only Sophia Bennett would occasionally exchange a few words with Lucas Sinclair to break the icy silence in the car.

When they reached the Bennett family mansion, Evelyn Whitmore—who had been sitting in the middle—politely stepped out first to give Sophia space to exit.

Sophia hesitated before asking Evelyn and Nathaniel Grayson if they wanted to come inside for a while. Both refused, though Nathaniel’s rejection was blunt while Evelyn’s was more hesitant.

With a reluctant sigh, Sophia bid Evelyn goodbye before heading inside.

Evelyn slid back into the car, settling by the window again. She slipped her earbuds in and closed her eyes, retreating into her music.

Nathaniel finally spoke, his voice cool. "What are you listening to?"

Evelyn didn’t open her eyes. "A song."

"Which one?"

"Just a pop song."

Nathaniel’s jaw tensed. His dark eyes flickered with irritation before he fell silent again.

Evelyn didn’t bother to glance at him.

Back at the Grayson estate, Evelyn went straight to her room. She showered, changed into comfortable clothes, and prepared for bed. The last two days had been exhausting.

When she stepped out of the bathroom, she spotted Nathaniel on the balcony, cigarette smoke curling around him as he stared into the night. The moonlight softened his sharp features, lending an almost ethereal quality to his cold demeanor.

Hearing the bathroom door open, he turned. His gaze landed on Evelyn, who was clearly ready to sleep. His brows furrowed.

"Dry your hair first," he ordered.

Evelyn sighed but obeyed, retreating back into the bathroom. The hum of the hairdryer soon filled the air.

Nathaniel exhaled sharply. She was following his instructions, yet it only made him more frustrated.

Half an hour later, Evelyn emerged again, her hair now dry. She barely took two steps toward the bed before Nathaniel’s voice cut through the silence.

"Come here. Pour me a glass of water."

Evelyn clenched her jaw but complied, setting the glass on the table in front of him before turning away.

Before she could leave, Nathaniel’s hand shot out, gripping her wrist. The sudden force yanked her backward, and she landed on his lap, his arm locking around her waist.

She glared at him. "What do you want now?"

Nathaniel exhaled a slow stream of smoke toward her face, his piercing gaze locked onto hers. "Evelyn, what’s with your attitude?"

Her frown deepened. "I did exactly what you asked. What more do you want? Should I kneel while handing you the glass next time?"
###Chapter 252

The sharp edge in Evelyn's voice was unmistakable. She was clearly irritated.

What had gotten into Nathaniel?

His brows knitted slightly. "Fine, but what's this attitude about?"

Evelyn crossed her arms. "I'm not being difficult. I just think when we're alone, we don't need to keep up this charade of being married. Men and women should maintain proper boundaries."

Amelia Rivers, Nathaniel's first love, had returned. It was obvious he still carried a torch for her.

Evelyn had no interest in playing the other woman. Even if people misunderstood her as jealous, she'd never actually become that person.

That's exactly why Benjamin and Gabrielle kept targeting her.

After what happened that night, she'd helped him out of obligation. But she intended to bury that memory forever.

When they weren't putting on an act, she needed to keep her distance. For her own peace of mind.

This was all just pretend. They were never truly husband and wife. Boundaries were necessary.

Her words darkened Nathaniel's stormy gaze. Was this stubborn woman still convinced he was just playing a role?

If only she'd pay attention, she'd know exactly how he felt about her.

"Boundaries, you say?" His lips curled into a cold smirk. "Very well. In that case, Miss Whitmore, you can sleep elsewhere tonight. Wouldn't want to violate your precious boundaries."

"Fine by me."

Evelyn nodded, pushed his arms away from her waist, and swiftly exited to the guest room.

She actually left.

A vein throbbed at Nathaniel's temple. He crushed his cigarette, grabbed the glass of water, and downed it in one angry gulp. Lighting another cigarette, he exhaled a frustrated cloud of smoke.

What the hell was wrong with that woman?

The vibration of a phone caught his attention.

Nathaniel took a drag, his narrowed eyes landing on the buzzing device—the phone he'd given Evelyn days ago.

Stubbing out his cigarette, he answered. "Yes?"

"Uncle, are you and Aunt Evelyn home?" Sophia's voice chirped through the line.

"We are."

"Is she... with you right now?"

Thinking of Evelyn's ridiculous behavior, his expression darkened. "She's asleep. What do you want with her?"

Assured Evelyn couldn't overhear, Sophia spoke freely. "Oh, nothing! I just wanted to ask... is everything okay between you two? The tension in the car was unbearable. What happened?"

"Don't pry into adult matters," Nathaniel snapped.

Sophia huffed. "Uncle, I'm actually six months older than Aunt Evelyn. Plus, I've been married before—that makes me more experienced! Tell me what's wrong. Maybe I can help!"

Nathaniel pinched the bridge of his nose. "She's being unreasonable."

"That's impossible! Women never get angry without reason," Sophia protested. "Especially someone as level-headed as Aunt Evelyn. There must be a cause."

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed. "Enlighten me then."

"Let me think..." Sophia paused dramatically. "Uncle, have you ever actually told Aunt Evelyn you love her?"

Silence.

"I knew it!" Sophia groaned. "Of course you haven't! How is she supposed to know your feelings if you never say them?"

Love her?
###Chapter 253

Nathaniel exhaled sharply after his niece's scolding. "If it's obvious, why spell it out?"

Sophia crossed her arms. "Because it's crucial! Women despise mixed signals! If you act intimate without clarifying your intentions, we feel disrespected and toyed with. No wonder she's furious!"

A rare hesitation flickered across Nathaniel's face. "She's already angry. How do I fix this?"

Sophia's jaw dropped. Was Nathaniel Grayson actually seeking her advice?

This unprecedented moment made her chest swell with importance.

"Obviously, you compensate properly! Choose the perfect moment, declare your feelings formally, make her feel chosen and secure! And listen—it must be ceremonial! I repeat—ceremonial! No woman rejects a grand romantic gesture from someone like you!"

"You're absolutely right to consult me, Uncle. Also, I think—"

Nathaniel ended the call mid-sentence.

Tossing his shirt aside, he strode into the shower, letting icy water cool his frustration.

Later, buttoning fresh sleeves, he intercepted a maid. "Where is she?"

"Madam retired to the south guest suite, sir. She requested dinner in her room earlier—likely asleep by now."

Nathaniel ascended to the third floor, locating the mentioned door.

The knob refused to turn.

Locked.

Against whom? The answer burned his pride.

"Fetch the key," he commanded.

Inside, Evelyn lay curled beneath satin sheets, brows knitted even in slumber.

Nathaniel perched on the mattress edge, tracing the crease between her eyebrows until it smoothed.

Her lashes fluttered open. Shock widened her eyes at his presence.

Before she could protest, he scooped her—quilt and all—into his arms.

"I leave for Tokyo at dawn. Back next weekend."

Evelyn blinked.

A phone call would've sufficed. Why the theatrics?

He deposited her in his bed, tucking the covers snugly. "We'll define this relationship properly when I return."

Sleep fled her instantly.

"Rest now." He silenced further questions with a fingertip to her lips and exited.

Evelyn stared at the ceiling, pulse racing, long after his footsteps faded.

True to his word, Nathaniel vanished for days, granting Evelyn freedom. She dismissed his overbearing security, visited Seraphina and Sebastian at Newmoon Group, and tackled backlogged projects.

The week evaporated.

Saturday afternoon, Sophia's call shattered her peace.

"Aunt Evelyn! Where are you?"

"Home. Why?"

"It's Uncle Nathaniel's birthday! What did you get him?"

The TV remote slipped from Evelyn's grip. "I... forgot."

"What?! Unacceptable! We're shopping—now!"
###Chapter 254

Evelyn tossed her phone aside and sank deeper into the sofa, crunching on potato chips while half-heartedly watching TV.

Twenty minutes later, Sophia burst into the Grayson mansion like a whirlwind, yanking Evelyn up with surprising strength. "We're going shopping! Nathaniel's birthday present won't pick itself!"

Evelyn groaned internally. Since when did she need to buy Nathaniel a gift?

She was just a fake wife playing her role without pay. Now she had to spend money on him too? The injustice burned.

VK Mall's luxury district buzzed with midday shoppers.

Sophia perched at a jewelry counter, examining glittering accessories with the intensity of a gemologist. "Aunt Evelyn, what do you think Uncle Nathaniel would prefer?"

Evelyn idly tried on sunglasses nearby, barely glancing at the display. "No clue."

Sophia's head snapped up, disbelief etching her features. "You've never noticed his preferences? At all?"

With a dramatic flick, Evelyn lowered the sunglasses. "Why would I? Is your uncle some endangered species? Will observing his habits win me a Nobel Prize?"

Sophia gaped. No woman had ever dismissed Nathaniel with such breathtaking nonchalance.

"That's exactly why he's obsessed with you!" Sophia squealed. "This aloofness is irresistible!"

Evelyn's eyebrow twitched. "Obsessed"? When had Nathaniel ever shown interest? The girl's imagination needed reining in.

"If you can't decide, just buy him clothes," Sophia declared. "He'll love anything you choose! There's a fantastic menswear boutique upstairs."

Before Evelyn could protest, Sophia dragged her into an opulent store where suits cost more than her monthly rent.

"What about this one?" Sophia held up a navy blazer.

Evelyn surveyed the racks of identical-looking formalwear. "His closet's full of these. Boring."

Then her gaze snagged on a clearance sign across the walkway. Thirty-dollar shirts. Perfect.

She marched over and plucked a white tee with a cartoon kitten print. "This."

Sophia's jaw dropped. "That's...adorable. For a six-year-old."

"Nathaniel needs to lighten up," Evelyn countered. "All those suits make him look like a tax auditor."

"But—"

"Miss?" Evelyn waved the shirt at a sales associate. "We'll take this."

At the register, she deliberately paid cash from her own wallet. Using Nathaniel's money would've been tacky.

"Done." Evelyn pocketed her change. "Coffee's on me."

UU Café's aroma wrapped around them as they settled at a corner table.

"You're fascinating," Sophia blurted between sips. "Other women bankrupt themselves impressing Uncle Nathaniel. You give him a kitten shirt."

Evelyn chewed a boba pearl slowly. "It's the gesture that counts."

"But shouldn't you worry he'll lose interest?"

Evelyn's carefree expression hardened. Her gaze turned razor-sharp as she studied Sophia.
###Chapter 255

"In this world, two things can never be controlled. One is time, and the other is a person's heart. If someone's heart no longer belongs to you, no matter how hard you try to win them over, it will never be yours again. So why waste your energy on something so pointless? It's better to focus on your own life, improve yourself, and be the one who holds the power."

Sophia Bennett was taken aback, her confusion quickly replaced by admiration. "Aunt Evelyn, that's so profound! I want to learn from you! Forget about men—just focus on your career!"

Evelyn Whitmore pinched her brow, worried Sophia might misunderstand. She clarified patiently, "That's not exactly what I meant. Love is beautiful—it enriches your life. But never lose yourself in it. Never sacrifice your future just to please a man. Understand?"

Sophia nodded eagerly, her eyes shining. "Yes, I do! Thank you for the advice, Aunt Evelyn!"

Evelyn wasn't sure if Sophia truly grasped her words, so she stopped there, lowering her gaze to sip her coffee.

What do I even know? I've never been in a serious relationship. I was just rambling based on instinct.

Sophia, though—she's impressionable. I hope my words make her think twice before falling for sweet talk.

Suddenly, her phone rang.

Evelyn pulled it out and saw Nathaniel Grayson's new number.

Of course—he was the one who gave her this phone and SIM card, then went and got himself a new number.

She answered. His deep voice filled the line. "Where are you?"

Evelyn took a slow sip of coffee. "At the downtown mall, Mister."

"With who?"

"Sophia."

"Give me the exact location. I'll send someone to pick you up."

Evelyn blinked. "Mister, are you back from your trip?"

"Just landed."

"No need to send anyone. Sophia drove—she'll take me home."

Nathaniel paused for two seconds. "Then both of you come to Silver Moon Estate after shopping. I have something to discuss."

Silver Moon Estate? Was he throwing himself a birthday party?

The thought of facing his relatives again made Evelyn frown. "Do I have to—"

"Yes." He cut her off sharply, as if he'd anticipated her resistance. "You're coming. I want to see you."

Evelyn fell silent.

Her pulse skipped.

Did Nathaniel just say he wanted to see her?

Since when did this composed, controlled man sound so urgent?

She remembered his words before his trip—that they'd have a serious talk about their relationship when he returned.

What did he want to discuss? What about their relationship needed clarification?

His behavior was strange. Was he planning to—

Sophia suddenly leaned into the phone. "Don't worry, Uncle! I'll bring Evelyn to you!"

As soon as Evelyn hung up, Sophia was already buzzing with excitement.

"Now that we've got the gift, you need a new outfit too, Aunt Evelyn! When he gets back, you two will be more lovey-dovey than newlyweds—you have to look stunning!"

Evelyn stared at her. More lovey-dovey than newlyweds?

Then she noticed the camera in Sophia's hands. "Why are you carrying that?"

Sophia grinned, adjusting the professional lens. "For my vlog! I'm documenting my daily life for VeeTube!"

Evelyn's lips twitched. "You need that for a vlog?"

"Better quality!"

Sophia had planned this. She wanted to capture the moment Nathaniel confessed—both as a keepsake and potential blackmail material.

Hah!

Unable to refuse Sophia's enthusiasm, Evelyn tried on a cream-white dress. The sales assistant styled her hair with a delicate diamond pin.

Sophia aimed the camera, eyes wide. "Evelyn, you look gorgeous!"

Evelyn felt overdressed and reached to remove it, but Sophia stopped her.

After paying, Sophia practically dragged Evelyn out of the mall and into the car, speeding toward Silver Moon Estate.
###Chapter 256

Silver Moon Estate

Sophia Bennett practically threw her car keys at the valet, eager to capture Evelyn Whitmore on camera.

“Aren’t you supposed to be filming your own vlog?” Evelyn sighed, exasperated.

“Why are you so obsessed with recording me instead?”

Sophia grinned. “Because you’re stunning, and I can’t help it!”

She wanted to film the exact moment Evelyn stepped out of the car and saw Nathaniel Grayson. The confession scene would be legendary—perfect for her social media. She could already imagine the envy.

Evelyn rolled her eyes and rubbed her temples, ignoring Sophia as she strode into the estate alone.

The entrance was framed by an arch adorned with moonstones. A fragrant breeze greeted her as she passed through.

Then, she froze.

The sight before her stole her breath.

Silver Moon Estate transformed with every visit.

This time, it was a sea of pink tulips—thousands of them, swaying under the golden sunset.

“Evelyn, why’d you stop?” Sophia caught up, gasping. “Oh my god! This is breathtaking!”

Nathaniel knew how to make an impression.

Any woman would be enchanted.

Evelyn blinked, snapping out of her daze.

Tulips weren’t in season. These had to be greenhouse-grown, transplanted carefully to avoid damage.

A narrow path cut through the flowers.

Evelyn stepped onto it, letting the blooms swallow her.

Sophia filmed frantically, barely containing her excitement for the grand finale.

Evelyn wasn’t stupid.

The empty estate, the flowers, the setup—this was for her.

At the end of the path stood Nathaniel.

His back was turned, his tailored suit accentuating his broad shoulders.

Hearing footsteps, he turned slowly.

Their eyes locked.

Evelyn’s pulse stuttered.

Too much coffee, she told herself.

Nathaniel’s lips curved. “You’re here.”

She nodded dumbly. “Yeah.”

Then she noticed it—a massive pink gift box between them, tied with an extravagant ribbon.

A present? For her?

Her stomach dropped.

She’d bought him a seven-dollar T-shirt.

Nathaniel stepped closer, his gaze softening.

Evelyn’s heart hammered.

He’s going to confess.

Her mind spun. What was she supposed to say?

Suddenly, the box burst open.
###Chapter 257

Colorful paper confetti exploded into the air as a slender, elegantly dressed young woman emerged from the decorative box, surrounded by a flurry of artificial butterflies. The scene looked like something out of a fairy tale.

"Natheniel!" Amelia Rivers squealed, rushing forward to throw her arms around him. "I can't believe you did all this for me! It's absolutely perfect!"

Evelyn Whitmore stood frozen, her earlier excitement draining away. Those butterflies she'd felt in her stomach now seemed like cruel irony.

Amelia was back.

Every Celestial Bloom at Silver Moon Estate had been cultivated for this moment. The reason Nathaniel had summoned Evelyn here became painfully clear - to announce the return of his true love. Her role as his temporary wife needed to end gracefully, without causing any distress to his precious Amelia. Of course.

How foolish she'd been.

For one breathtaking moment, she'd actually believed this elaborate setup was for her. That Nathaniel Grayson might declare his feelings.

Pathetic. Hadn't he made it perfectly clear? He could offer her everything except his heart. That belonged solely to Amelia.

Just like the meaning behind those Celestial Blooms - flawless, eternal love.

A stray butterfly fluttered near Evelyn's face, as if mocking her presence. She didn't belong here.

Nearby, Sophia Bennett stood slack-jawed, her phone still recording what was supposed to be Nathaniel's grand romantic gesture to Evelyn.

"What the actual hell?" she muttered under her breath.

Why today of all days? Why did Amelia have to return now?

Wait. Where did Evelyn go?

Sophia panicked when she realized Evelyn had vanished. She scanned the area frantically with her phone camera but found no trace of her.

Her fingers flew across her phone screen as she dialed Evelyn's number. Only an automated voice responded.

"The number you have dialed is currently unavailable..."

Evelyn was gone.

Night had fallen over the city.

At the bustling riverwalk of downtown New Capital...

The skyline glittered with towering skyscrapers, their lights reflecting off the water in a dazzling display. But tonight, something extraordinary was happening.

The Century Bank Tower's massive LED display kept flashing the same message in bold letters:

[I LOVE YOU, AMELIA]

The adjacent building's display echoed similar sentiments:

[WELCOME HOME, MY PRINCESS]

The night sky erupted in bursts of sapphire fireworks, their brilliant trails lingering longer than usual. A fleet of drones formed a perfect heart shape, complete with an arrow piercing through it.

Couples strolling along the riverwalk, tourists, and locals alike stopped to gawk at the extravagant display. Murmurs of awe and envy filled the air.

"Whoever's behind this must be loaded!"

"That's true love right there!"

"More like true wealth if you ask me."

Rumors spread quickly through the crowd.

"Someone bought out the entire greenhouse stock of Celestial Blooms for Silver Moon Estate. Must be preparing some grand romantic gesture."

"Silver Moon Estate? For Princess Amelia? Is Amelia Rivers back in town?"

"Who's Amelia Rivers?"

"Are you serious? The Rivera heiress? Her grandfather's a Nobel laureate, grandmother's actual royalty. Her father's an Olympic gold medalist, mother's an Oscar-winning actress. Her brothers are literally ranked among the world's wealthiest bachelors. That girl was born with a diamond spoon in her mouth!"

"And stunningly beautiful too."

"No wonder someone's going all out. How do you impress a woman who's had everything since birth?"

Evelyn sat alone on a riverside bench, sipping from a soda can as she watched the spectacle unfold across the city skyline. The dazzling lights reflected in her cold, distant eyes while a bitter smile played on her lips.

What an ostentatious declaration of love.

Nathaniel Grayson certainly knew how to make his feelings known.
###Chapter 258

The night sky stretched endlessly, its dark canvas interrupted only by the luminous full moon hanging indifferently above. The celestial body seemed completely detached from the lively human dramas unfolding beneath it.

Evelyn pulled out her phone and snapped a picture of the glowing orb. Without thinking, she uploaded it to social media with the caption: [Tonight's moon is breathtaking.]

Within moments, a notification popped up. A user named Amelia had liked the post and commented: [Absolutely stunning.]

Evelyn frowned. She didn't recognize that name in her contacts. Curiosity piqued, she tapped on the profile.

A cheerful young woman smiled back at her from the profile picture. Scrolling through the feed confirmed her suspicion - this was Amelia Rivers' personal account.

Her stomach dropped. She'd been using Nathaniel's phone this whole time. The post had gone to his account, not hers.

"Damn it," she muttered under her breath. Then she shrugged. "Whatever. It's just a moon photo. Not like I posted anything compromising."

Closing the app, she dialed a familiar number. Sebastian answered on the first ring.

"Yonder River. Now," she ordered curtly.

"On my way, boss."

Tossing her empty soda can into a nearby bin, Evelyn crossed the street to wait for her ride. That's when she noticed the elderly blind man struggling near the curb.

The man tapped his white cane nervously, finding obstacles in every direction. His wrinkled face twisted in frustration as he reached out, trying to identify what blocked his path.

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. Some idiot had parked their SUV right across the tactile paving.

"Unbelievable," she muttered, approaching the stranded man. "Sir, there's a car parked illegally on the walkway. The driver's not here, but I can help you get around it."

What happened next shocked her.

The elderly man's face darkened with rage. Without warning, he swung his cane with surprising force, shattering the SUV's passenger window.

Glass rained onto the pavement.

Evelyn's eyebrows shot up. "Well... that's one way to handle it."

The man huffed, knocking his cane against the ground. "Disrespectful brats! Maybe this will teach them not to park where people walk!"

While vandalism wasn't exactly legal, Evelyn couldn't entirely disagree with the sentiment. She sighed. "Sir, let's not get arrested tonight. Maybe they just made a mistake."

She gently guided the still-fuming man around the damaged vehicle, making a mental note to be more careful where she parked in the future.
###Chapter 259

Evelyn's words did little to calm the blind elderly man.

"Even if they're in a hurry, parking on tactile paving is unacceptable!" His voice trembled with anger. "People these days only care about themselves. They never stop to think how their actions affect others!"

He wasn’t wrong.

Evelyn sighed and reached out to guide the man past the SUV when a sharp voice cut through the air. "Hey! What the hell did you just do?!"

She turned to see a girl with vibrant purple hair storming toward them, gripping a selfie stick. The girl’s eyes locked onto the shattered window, and her face twisted in outrage. "What the actual f*ck? Did you two just wreck my car?!"

Evelyn recognized her—the same influencer she’d seen earlier by Yonder River, broadcasting confessions for views while cooing for gifts in a sickly-sweet voice.

The blind man stiffened at the girl’s vulgar language. Though he couldn’t see, his hearing was sharp. He turned toward the sound of her voice. "So you’re the one who parked here?"

The girl crossed her arms. "Damn right I did. This SUV cost me seventy-five thousand dors, and you just smashed it! Pay up!"

The old man didn’t flinch. "Good. You deserve it. Tactile paving isn’t for parking. Doesn’t matter how expensive your car is—if it’s blocking the way, it should be smashed!"

The girl scoffed. "It’s my car. I’ll park wherever I want. Who cares about some stupid paving? Is this your road? Who made you the boss?"

The man’s breath hitched, his face flushing with frustration. "Is this how your parents raised you? To disrespect others like this?"

Evelyn quickly steadied him, rubbing his back. Then she fixed the girl with a firm look. "You’re in the wrong here. Move your car. Now."

The influencer rolled her eyes. "Or what? You’ll call the cops? Oh wait—there aren’t any. Mind your own business!"

The old man had had enough. He pulled Evelyn behind him and raised his cane. "Move the car, or I’ll make you regret it."

The girl smirked. "Try me, old man. I’ve got three hundred thousand followers. You think I’m scared of you?"

Before Evelyn could react, the man swung.

The girl dodged easily and shoved him to the ground. "Pathetic."

Evelyn rushed to help him up, her blood boiling. The old man was unhurt but shaken, his breathing ragged.

That was it.

She stood, locking eyes with the girl. "Enough. Move. Your. Car."
###Chapter 260

"I'm not moving my car! What are you gonna do about it?" The purple-haired girl sneered at Evelyn, sizing her up with contempt.

That's when she noticed Evelyn was... stunningly beautiful. The realization only fueled her rage.

Still, she assumed Evelyn would be an easy target—too fragile and meek to stand up to her.

A wicked idea struck her.

She unlocked her phone mounted on the selfie stick and went live instantly. Her demeanor flipped like a switch as she played the victim for her audience.

"Help me, everyone! I'm being attacked! This old man and this girl smashed my car for no reason! Now he's faking an injury to extort me! Look how they're bullying me! sob sob—"

She deliberately angled the camera downward, ensuring her viewers couldn't see her illegally parked car blocking the tactile pathway.

Evelyn stayed silent while the influencer spun her lies. First, she helped the blind elderly man to a safer spot away from potential harm.

Then she turned back to confront the influencer.

The streamer's twisted narrative grated on Evelyn's nerves. Without warning, she snatched the selfie stick, snapped it in half, and hurled both pieces—phone included—far into the distance.

"MY PHONE! MY EQUIPMENT!" The influencer's shriek of rage shattered her victim act. She rolled up her sleeves, spitting venom. "You're dead, bitch! I'll destroy you!"

Her manicured hand swung toward Evelyn's face—only for Evelyn to catch her wrist mid-air and twist it backward.

"ARGH!" The purple-haired girl squealed in pain. "Let me go!"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Beat me? You'd need decades of training to land a single hit."

Despite the pain, the influencer hissed threats. "I have millions of followers! They'll hunt you down for this!"

"I don't care if you're the queen of influencers," Evelyn countered coldly. "Parking on tactile paving? Shoving a blind elder? Let's see how many followers stick around when they learn what trash you really are."

The streamer faltered, realizing Evelyn wasn't bluffing. "I—"

"Last chance," Evelyn's voice turned glacial. "Move. The. Car."

"I'll move it! Just let go!" The moment Evelyn released her, the influencer scurried toward her vehicle—but her eyes burned with vengeance.

Spotting the broken selfie stick, she seized it and lunged at the blind man with its jagged end. "This is for damaging my car, old fool!"

Evelyn reacted instantly. A swift kick sent the influencer sprawling.

The deranged woman scrambled up, face twisted in fury, and charged again with the makeshift weapon aimed at both Evelyn and the elderly man.
###Chapter 261

Evelyn reacted instantly as the purple-haired girl lunged at them again. Her body moved before her mind could process it, arms spreading wide to shield the blind elderly man behind her. She braced herself, ready to strike if necessary.

Without warning, a group of men in black suits materialized, encircling Evelyn and the old man. Two of them swiftly restrained the enraged girl.

The influencer with the purple hair thrashed violently, shrieking, "Who the hell are you?! Let me go!"

The leader of the men shot her a chilling glare before turning away. He approached the elderly man and bowed deeply, concern lacing his voice. "Sir, we've been searching everywhere for you. Are you hurt? The young master is frantic with worry."

The old man huffed. "That boy keeps me locked up like some prisoner. I just wanted fresh air."

The guard sighed. "He only wants to keep you safe, especially with your condition."

Straightening his posture, the elderly man crossed his arms stubbornly. "Since when does a grandson dictate his grandfather's life? It should be the other way around!"

The leader hesitated, then pulled out his phone. "Sir, we've located him. Yes, by Yonder River. Understood."

Minutes later, a sleek black limousine glided to a stop nearby.

The guard captain rushed to open the door, revealing a tall, impeccably dressed man stepping out with effortless grace.

He moved like royalty, his tailored gray suit accentuating his commanding presence. The crowd that had gathered gasped—this was the kind of man who belonged on magazine covers, not in their mundane lives.

Every step he took sent pulses of excitement through the onlookers, his aura radiating power and sophistication.

"Grandfather," he said, his voice deceptively soft, "if you keep sneaking out, I'll have no choice but to relocate you to a secured retirement facility."

The elderly man turned his milky eyes toward his grandson, unimpressed. He tapped his white cane sharply against the pavement. "Try me."

The man in gray merely smiled, though his gaze remained cool. "You know I keep my word."

A tense silence stretched between them. The old man knew better than to push his luck—his grandson was every bit as stubborn as he was. And the thought of being confined to a retirement home was unbearable.

Clearing his throat, he gestured toward Evelyn. "This young woman saved me from some lunatic who parked on the tactile paving and shoved me. You should thank her properly."
###Chapter 262

The man lifted his gaze to Evelyn, who stood beside his grandfather.

Her expression remained calm and detached, a stark contrast to the shocked faces of the onlookers. It was as if she existed in her own world, unaffected by the chaos around her.

In truth, she hadn’t even blinked when she first saw the man’s striking features.

Evelyn had considered slipping away the moment she realized the elderly man’s family had arrived, but the men in black still encircled them, leaving no clear exit.

The man offered her a polite nod. "Hello."

Evelyn returned the gesture. "Hello."

Like any woman, she could appreciate a handsome face. The man before her was undeniably attractive—but there was something dangerous lurking beneath that charming smile.

Despite his pleasant demeanor, she sensed no genuine warmth in him. His eyes held a calculated coldness, warning her to keep her distance.

He was nothing like Nathaniel.

Nathaniel wore his hostility openly, his entire presence a silent command for others to stay away.

This man, however, masked his indifference behind a veneer of charm. Yet, the distance in his gaze was unmistakable.

"Thank you," he said.

"You’re welcome," Evelyn replied.

Their exchange was brief, neither of them inclined to continue the conversation.

The elderly man huffed in frustration.

"Girl, what’s your name?" he blurted out. "Do you have a boyfriend? What do you think of my grandson here? He’s over thirty and still—"

"Grandfather." The man pinched the bridge of his nose, shooting Evelyn an apologetic glance. "Forgive him. He speaks without thinking."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "It’s fine."

She had no intention of sharing her name.

"Since your grandson is here, I’ll take my leave," she said smoothly. "I have other matters to attend to."

With a polite nod, she requested the men in black to step aside and walked away, her posture neither arrogant nor submissive.

The elderly man sighed dramatically as she disappeared. "Well? What did you think? She’s beautiful, isn’t she?"

The man watched Evelyn’s retreating figure. "Very."

"Then why didn’t you ask for her number?" the old man grumbled. "I even tried to help you!"

"Grandfather, my love life is none of your concern."

"None of my concern? Bring home a wife, then! At your age, I already had children!"

The man exhaled, unamused. "You’re tired. I’ll have them take you home."

"I’m not tired!"

"Escort my grandfather home," he ordered.

"Yes, sir," his subordinates replied.

Evelyn hadn’t gone far when the leader of the men in black approached her again.

"Miss," he said, holding out a check. "My employer wishes to express his gratitude for saving his grandfather. You may write any amount you desire."

Evelyn glanced at the check and smirked. "A blank check with a cap of seven hundred fifty thousand dollars? And he expects me to name my price?"

The leader stiffened. Was she implying the offer was insulting?

Before he could respond, Evelyn had already descended the stairs and slid into Sebastian’s pink sports car.
###Chapter 263

Sebastian's car had barely disappeared around the corner when another sleek black vehicle pulled into the same spot.

Benjamin practically leaped out before the car fully stopped, rushing toward the imposing figure in a charcoal-gray suit. "Samuel! Is everything okay?" he asked breathlessly. "Did you find Grandfather?"

The man was none other than Samuel Rivers, Benjamin's older brother.

Having just convinced their grandfather to return home, Samuel turned at the sound of his brother's panting. He ignored the question. "Where were you?"

Normally brash and arrogant like any spoiled heir, Benjamin transformed into a meek mouse around Samuel. His shoulders hunched defensively.

"Samuel, I... I was at Silver Moon Estate..."

Samuel's expression darkened. "School starts next week. Shouldn't you be studying? This is your third senior year. Determined to keep your 'Campus Prince' title forever?"

Benjamin flushed. The nickname stung.

Sure, being voted most handsome by the student body was flattering—the first time. But failing university entrance exams twice had turned the title into a humiliating joke.

"This time is different! There was a special occasion today—"

Samuel cut him off with a derisive snort. "Every day is a special occasion in your world."

Benjamin's eyes widened earnestly. "I'm serious! Amelia's back! Nathaniel decorated the entire estate with pink tulips—it was like something out of a fairy tale! I had to see her happy moment!"

"Amelia's back?" Samuel stiffened.

His sharp eyes narrowed. Something wasn't right. "Nathaniel is married now. Why would she return?"

Instantly defensive of his sister, Benjamin lifted his chin. "That marriage is just for his grandfather's sake. You know he doesn't love that woman. Amelia nearly died last time we kept them apart!"

Samuel's jaw tightened. He rubbed his temple. Family drama was exhausting.

Just then, a black-suited subordinate approached. "Sir, what should we do about the influencer?"

"Influencer?" Samuel glanced at his buzzing phone, scanning the latest headlines. His expression remained impassive. "Blacklist her. Ensure she never 'influences' anyone again. Make her—and that illegally parked car—disappear from this city."

The man nodded sharply. "Understood."

Moments later, another subordinate returned—the one who'd chased after Evelyn. He held out the rejected check. "Sir, the young lady refused the compensation and left."

Samuel paused mid-text. His lips quirked in genuine surprise. "Integrity. Impressive."

Oliver Kingsley, the team leader, cleared his throat awkwardly. "Actually... I believe she implied the amount was... insufficient."

Samuel studied the check in Oliver's hand, recalling Evelyn's proud posture. If money was her goal, she wouldn't have walked away so easily. Some people still valued dignity over wealth.

Benjamin peered at the check and whistled. "Who turns down 750K? If she doesn't want it, I'll take it!" His hand darted out greedily.

Faster than a striking viper, Samuel snatched the check and shredded it. "You forfeited access to family funds when you failed your exams. Now, home. Study."

"...Yes, Samuel."

Benjamin's head drooped so low his chin nearly touched his chest. All his tears had dried up long ago.
###Chapter 264

Sky Mirror Residence overlooked the shimmering Yonder River. Each floor housed only one lavish unit, making it one of the most coveted addresses in the city center.

On the 28th floor—

Evelyn collapsed onto the couch like melted wax, exhaustion weighing her down. She didn’t want to move a muscle.

A plush, cream-colored cat—more butter than fur—leaped into her lap, nudging her insistently with its head.

That was enough to make Evelyn sit up and indulge the demanding creature.

The cat, Mia, had been rescued by Sebastian from the countryside eight years ago.

At first glance, Mia looked like a pampered aristocrat. In reality, she’d survived on scraps in a damp basement with Evelyn, Seraphina, and Sebastian before their fortunes changed.

Now, she lounged in luxury, feasting on gourmet meals.

Seraphina warmed milk in the open kitchen, glancing toward the living room. "Boss, what miracle brought you back today?"

Evelyn curled up on the oversized couch, drowsily stroking Mia. "Took a day off. Figured I’d check on you two."

Seraphina adjusted her gold-framed glasses and set the warm milk on the coffee table. "Nathaniel actually let you go?"

Evelyn sighed, eyes still closed. "He’s busy. Won’t notice I’m gone."

Truthfully, she just didn’t feel like returning to the Grayson estate today. The thought alone made her chest tighten.

Sebastian emerged from his shower, dropping onto the single-seater. "Boss, I need your chestnut cake."

Seraphina shot him a withering glare. "She just got back, and you’re already demanding desserts?"

Evelyn waved a lazy hand. "Too tired today. I’ll bake it tomorrow."

Sebastian smirked triumphantly. "See? That’s how she spoils me."

Seraphina rolled her eyes, resisting the urge to smack him.

This dynamic was nothing new. Evelyn mothered Sebastian when she had the energy and bossed him around when she didn’t.

They’d met as teenagers—three lost souls who clawed their way out of misery together. Newmoon Group was their hard-won sanctuary.

No more living under someone else’s roof.

Seraphina ignored Sebastian, focusing on Evelyn. "About Grayson Group’s new office design—they’ve been pushing for updates. I stalled them, but when do you plan to deliver the draft?"

Evelyn sipped her milk. "Three days. I’ll email Nathaniel directly. Once he approves, I’ll handle the exterior details. You’re off the hook."

Sebastian propped his chin on his hand, grinning. "Boss, isn’t Nathaniel your husband? Why email when you could just… discuss it in bed?"

Evelyn’s expression iced over. She leveled him with a glare. "It’s a temporary marriage. We’ll go our separate ways when it’s over. Drop the nonsense."

Sebastian blinked, startled. Even Seraphina stiffened at the sudden chill in Evelyn’s voice.
###Chapter 265

Evelyn wasn't quite herself today.

Sebastian immediately recognized his blunder. He'd clearly struck a nerve with his careless remark. Rushing to her side, he offered a hasty apology.

"Boss, my bad. Won't happen again."

Truthfully, Evelyn wasn't truly angry with him. Just frustrated. She exhaled sharply, rolling her eyes. "Enough with the puppy eyes. Any updates on Vivian's paintings in the market?"

Sebastian straightened up, all business now. "Negative. The current market's flooded with international artists. Haven't spotted any local works recently."

Evelyn's gaze turned sharp, her expression darkening. "Keep monitoring it closely."

"On it, boss!"

Ever since discovering Gregory wasn't her biological father, Evelyn had become obsessed with uncovering her mother's past.

She needed answers.

Who was her real father? Why had he abandoned them?

Why had her mother left her at that hospital? Why entrust her to a complete stranger?

What secrets lay buried in the past?

The questions burned inside her, demanding resolution.

Seraphina noticed Evelyn's stormy expression. She jerked her chin toward Sebastian. "Hey, go grab some late-night snacks. Boss needs food."

Sebastian scowled. "Seriously? I just showered! Why don't you go?"

Seraphina ignored his protest. "Get those chocolate donuts she likes too."

"Slave driver," Sebastian muttered, though he was already heading to change. Within minutes, he grabbed his keys and left.

Once alone, Seraphina turned to Evelyn. "Heard about today's spectacle."

Evelyn blinked, snapping out of her thoughts. "What spectacle?"

"The whole Silver Moon Estate covered in pink tulips? The light show on Century Bank Tower? The drone display?" Seraphina gestured toward their balcony. "Saw it while doing laundry."

Evelyn glanced out their floor-to-ceiling windows. The massive LED display was still visible across the river.

Their penthouse offered the most breathtaking view of the Yonder River skyline.

Seraphina pressed further. "Nathaniel's doing, I presume? For Amelia?"

Evelyn gave a tight nod. "Every last bit of it."

"What's their history?" Seraphina probed.

"Childhood sweethearts. Forced apart. Details are fuzzy," Evelyn replied tersely.

Seraphina's eyes gleamed knowingly. "You're in a foul mood tonight." She tilted her head. "Could it be... jealousy?"

Evelyn choked violently on her milk, coughing until tears sprang to her eyes.
###Chapter 266

Seraphina rushed to take the glass of milk from Evelyn's trembling hands, placing it firmly back on the coffee table.

She grabbed a tissue and handed it to Evelyn before gently rubbing her back.

After several tense moments, Evelyn's coughing subsided. "Seraphina, you're right. I'm not myself today."

Seraphina nodded knowingly. "What happened?"

At the question, Evelyn's eyes flashed with barely contained fury.

"Because Nathaniel was being completely unreasonable! I was having a perfectly fine day until he deliberately made me witness their reunion. Regardless of the circumstances, I'm still his lawful wife. That was beyond disrespectful."

Seraphina pressed her lips into a thin line. "That's... truly unacceptable."

Evelyn's frown deepened. "I know he wanted to announce his precious Amelia's return. Or perhaps remind me to stay in my place and not upset his darling. But words would have sufficed! There was no need for that humiliating spectacle."

Seraphina nodded in agreement. "Absolutely. That was cruel and unnecessary."

Evelyn slumped back against the couch in frustration. "Which is why I'm so furious. How am I supposed to play the dutiful wife for the remainder of this contract when I'm constantly caught between them?"

"Oh!" Seraphina's lips curled into a mischievous smile. "Simple - don't go back. Let them have their happily ever after while you wash your hands of this mess!"

Evelyn sighed. "I can't. The contract is for three months, and only two weeks have passed. I gave my word. Besides, old man Richard isn't someone to cross. If I disappear mid-contract, he'd turn the world upside down to find me. That would only create more problems."

"So you're returning tomorrow?"

"Yes. Just six more weeks. I'll endure it, even if every fiber of my being protests."

Seraphina moved behind Evelyn, massaging her shoulders sympathetically. "My poor darling."

Evelyn pursed her lips. Honestly, being Nathaniel's temporary wife was more exhausting than any physical labor.

Since moving into the Grayson estate, her life had become a never-ending drama.

After a thoughtful pause, Seraphina asked cautiously, "But... speaking from experience, I have to ask - did you two... sleep together during this time?"

The lingering flush from Evelyn's coughing fit deepened. Though reluctant, she answered truthfully. "Yes... Just once."

"Protection?" Seraphina's brows knitted together. She hadn't expected this answer - the question was merely precautionary.

Protection?

Evelyn froze momentarily before admitting guiltily, "No... It happened too suddenly, under unusual circumstances. I wasn't thinking clearly. Surely I can't be that unlucky to get pregnant from one time?"

"These things happen. If you truly want no ties to Nathaniel after the contract, be more careful next time," Seraphina advised gently.

Evelyn's gaze turned icy. "That was an accident. It won't happen again."

Still concerned, Seraphina pressed further. "Then... do you have feelings for him?"

Evelyn scoffed. "Why would I? Because he's ancient? Because of his terrible temper? Because he enjoys tormenting me?"

Seraphina found Evelyn's indignant expression rather endearing.

She smirked. "What I meant was - do you find him attractive?"

Evelyn didn't hesitate. "Objectively? Of course he's attractive. He won the genetic lottery with that face and body. That's fact, not feelings. Don't tell me you disagree?"

Seraphina cleared her throat. "Well... he's not entirely unpleasant to look at!"

Evelyn suddenly looked up sharply. "Wait - since when do you like older men? I thought you preferred younger guys."

Seraphina wiggled her eyebrows suggestively. "I don't discriminate. Variety is the spice of life!"

Studying her friend's expression, Evelyn suddenly felt sorry for Seraphina's string of ex-boyfriends, all discarded once she grew bored.

Evelyn shook her head in pity. "Seraphina, you're not getting any younger. Do some good deeds. Stop toying with those boys and take relationships more seriously."
###Chapter 267

Seraphina shrugged casually. Her obsession wasn't important, and she didn't want Evelyn to worry about her.

She steered the conversation back. "Oh! Sebastian is quite handsome too. Nearly six feet tall, broad shoulders, narrow waist with those sculpted abs. Wouldn't you say he's sexy?"

Evelyn blinked in shock.

Absolutely not!

Sebastian might charm countless women, but to her, he'd always be that same goofy kid from childhood.

Seraphina kept massaging Evelyn's shoulders. "See the difference? You don't find every attractive man appealing unless there's real chemistry."

'Is she implying I have feelings for Nathaniel?' Evelyn wondered.

She wrinkled her nose in distaste. "That's because Sebastian's too pretty-boy for my taste!"

Seraphina nodded. "Fair point. He's not my type either!"

The door swung open suddenly.

Sebastian strolled in lazily. "So you two sent me out for midnight snacks just to trash-talk me?"

Seraphina adjusted her glasses. "We were complimenting your physique. Is that considered slander?"

Sebastian dropped the takeout bags on the coffee table and stripped off his jacket to flex. "Damn right I've got an incredible body. Two hours daily at the gym, premium protein supplements - feel free to verify!"

"Ugh!" Seraphina groaned. "Don't make us lose our appetites!"

Undeterred, Sebastian kept flexing.

Evelyn tapped her chin thoughtfully. "You know, Seraphina might be right. With only one experience, maybe I've got skewed standards. Should sample more to know what I truly like."

She reached out to poke Sebastian's covered abs.

"Well?" He flashed a cocky grin. "Am I irresistible?"

Evelyn recoiled instantly. "You're absolutely right, Seraphina. Touching someone I feel nothing for is... unsettling."

Sebastian's smile froze. "Boss! Was that an insult?"

Seraphina patted his shoulder. "No doubt about it. She definitely insulted you."

"Hmph!" Sebastian crossed his arms. "You wicked women enjoy tormenting me!"

They bantered through their late-night meal before retiring to their rooms.

Sleep eluded Evelyn - perhaps from the heavy supper.

She rose unusually early and baked the promised chestnut cakes, leaving portions for Seraphina and Sebastian before taking the rest with her.

The taxi dropped her at the Grayson estate.

Today, neither Theodore nor any maids greeted her.

Instead, a barefoot girl in silk pajamas answered, rubbing sleep from her eyes. "Who are you?"

Evelyn recognized her instantly from the photo.

Amelia Rivers.
###Chapter 268

Evelyn Whitmore stood frozen at the doorstep, her grip tightening on the lunchbox in her hand.

The woman before her was slightly shorter, her porcelain skin almost translucent, giving her a delicate, fragile appearance. Her perfectly shaped eyebrows framed gentle eyes that drooped slightly at the corners, lending her an air of innocent vulnerability. A single beauty mark rested between her brows.

She was undeniably pretty—not in a striking, bold way, but in a manner that made people instinctively want to shield her.

Yet, the sight of her standing there in a nightgown, barefoot, made Evelyn’s lips curl in bitter amusement.

So she spent the night here.

Evelyn wasn’t surprised. She had been smart enough to stay away last night, sparing herself the humiliation. But Nathaniel? Did he really have to be this shameless?

Married or not—even if their union was nothing more than a transaction—bringing his ex back into their home was a new low.

The woman blinked her large, doe-like eyes when Evelyn didn’t respond. “Hello? Who are you looking for?”

Evelyn hesitated. She wasn’t ignoring her—she just didn’t know how to answer. Telling her name would mean nothing. Claiming to be Nathaniel’s wife felt like an unnecessary provocation.

She had no interest in starting a fight.

“I’m not looking for anyone,” she finally said. “I’m staying here temporarily.”

The woman’s eyes widened. “You live here?”

Before Evelyn could respond, hurried footsteps echoed from the staircase. Theodore Whitmore, the butler, rushed down, his face lighting up when he spotted her.

“Madam! You’re back!”

Evelyn gave him a curt nod.

Theodore scanned her from head to toe, relief washing over his features. “Where were you last night? We were worried.”

“I stayed at a friend’s place,” Evelyn replied dismissively, stepping inside.

Theodore exhaled. “Well, I’m glad you’re safe.”

She handed him the lunchbox. “Theodore, put this chestnut cake in the freezer. I’ll have it later.”

“Of course, Madam.” He motioned for a maid, whispering instructions before she hurried off—no doubt to inform Nathaniel of her return.

Evelyn barely spared the woman another glance as she headed for the stairs. She had work to do. The Holden Group’s building design wasn’t going to draft itself, and she was already behind schedule.

But then—

“Evelyn.”

The voice was soft, almost hesitant.

She stopped mid-step, surprised. She knows my name?

Turning, she arched a brow. “Yes? Can I help you?”
###Chapter 269

Amelia's wide doe eyes locked onto Evelyn as she stepped closer. "So you're Evelyn!"

Evelyn gave a slight nod. "Yes, that's me."

What’s this about? Is she trying to pick a fight?

Without warning, Amelia suddenly seized Evelyn’s hands, her expression soft with apology. "I'm so sorry. I didn’t realize it was you. I thought you were just another guest."

Evelyn wasn’t one for physical contact with strangers. She calmly pulled her hands free and offered a polite smile. "No harm done. We’ve never met before, so it’s understandable."

Amelia, undeterred, beamed at her with startling sincerity. "Nathaniel talks about you all the time when we’re on the phone."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Does he? And what exactly does he say?"

She doubted Nathaniel had anything flattering to share.

Amelia’s admiration was almost blinding. "He never stops praising you. Says you’re brilliant, not the type to chase wealth or status. That you know your place and keep your distance. Honestly, he couldn’t stop listing all your virtues."

That was… a lot. Clearly, they spoke often.

To Evelyn, it didn’t sound like praise. More like Nathaniel was reassuring Amelia that nothing was happening between them.

Hah. Didn’t take him for the self-aware type. Guess he’s got survival instincts after all.

Evelyn forced a smile. "Well, I suppose I should thank him for the compliments."

"Evelyn, I really appreciate you helping Nathaniel with his family lately," Amelia said earnestly.

"It’s nothing," Evelyn replied dryly. In truth, she’d had no choice.

"You’re so kind. I have a feeling we’re going to be great friends." Amelia grabbed her hands again, blinking up at her with playful warmth.

Evelyn barely suppressed a grimace. Amelia was too friendly.

She didn’t dislike her, but she had no intention of getting close to anyone in Nathaniel’s world. Once their contract ended, she’d cut ties with all of them.

"Nathaniel! You’re back!" Amelia suddenly released Evelyn and rushed toward the door.

Evelyn turned to see Nathaniel stepping inside, his expression tense.

Oddly, he was still in yesterday’s suit, his hair disheveled by the wind. The usually immaculate man looked almost… approachable.

His gaze zeroed in on Evelyn the second he entered. His sharp eyes were bloodshot, stubble shadowing his jaw.

He looked rough. Exhausted. Dangerous.

And haggard—something his composed demeanor had never betrayed before.

Had he lost weight overnight?

Evelyn narrowed her eyes. They must’ve had quite the reunion. Probably couldn’t keep their hands off each other.

Especially after that dramatic love confession.
###Chapter 270

Evelyn tugged at the hem of Nathaniel's shirt and whispered, "Nathaniel, I've introduced myself to Amelia."

She smiled brightly. "You were right about her! She's lovely, and I really like her!"

Nathaniel finally tore his gaze away from Evelyn and looked down at Amelia. "Go change your clothes. I'll have Lucas take you home. Your family's been worried."

Amelia pouted but nodded obediently. "Alright. I'll head back now."

Nathaniel gave a curt nod before glancing up again—only to find Evelyn gone.

While Nathaniel had been speaking to Amelia, Evelyn had slipped upstairs. She wasn't about to stand around awkwardly as the third wheel.

The moment she stepped into the bedroom, she froze.

Something was off.

This was Nathaniel's room, and she'd been staying here ever since moving in, playing the dutiful wife for appearances.

Nathaniel rarely slept here. Even when he did, he'd shower and crash on the couch, never disturbing anything. The maids knew better than to rearrange anything without permission.

Yet now, the items on the shelves and nightstand had shifted. Even the lamp, which she always kept on the left side for convenience, had been moved to the right.

The bed was meticulously made, the sheets crisp and wrinkle-free—as if freshly changed this morning.

A cold realization settled in her stomach.

Had Nathaniel and Amelia slept here last night?

Of course they had. Where else would he take the woman he loved?

Disgust twisted inside her. The room suddenly felt tainted. She'd rather sleep in the guest room.

She turned to leave—only to collide with a solid wall of muscle.

Nathaniel stood in the doorway, his towering frame casting a shadow over her. His presence was suffocating.

She instinctively stepped back, meeting his gaze.

Up close, the exhaustion in his eyes was undeniable. Dark veins spiderwebbed across the whites, evidence of a sleepless night.

Just how passionate had they been? Nathaniel was always so controlled, so disciplined. For him to lose himself like this—he must truly love Amelia.

Evelyn's expression darkened. "You look exhausted. Take the room. I'll sleep elsewhere."

She tried to sidestep him, but he blocked her path. His voice was low, dangerous. "Where were you last night?"

"At a friend's place," she answered flatly.

His jaw tightened. "Who gave you permission to stay out all night?"

Evelyn's brows shot up. Permission?

She was an adult, not a child. What did it matter where she slept? Besides, coming back would've been worse.

What if she'd walked in on something she wasn't meant to see?

Now that would've been awkward.
###Chapter 271

"I stayed up late chatting with friends, so I crashed at their place."

Nathaniel leaned down, invading Evelyn's personal space. "What kind of friends? Male or female? Names? Addresses?"

His interrogation sparked her temper. "Am I not permitted to have friends? Or must I surrender all privacy when I'm with you? Should I file hourly reports? This feels more like house arrest than a relationship!"

Nathaniel didn't react to her outburst as expected. Instead, his lips curved slightly as he studied her furious expression. The exhaustion weighing him down lifted somewhat seeing her so spirited.

He let the silence stretch before asking pointedly, "Where's your phone? A simple call would've sufficed if you planned to stay out."

Evelyn's confidence wavered. She spread her hands helplessly. "About that...I lost it last night. No idea where. I'll replace it with the same model."

The phone had likely fallen out during her altercation with that celebrity. She'd only realized it was missing when hailing a cab this morning. Thank goodness she'd carried cash.

Nathaniel snorted, producing the missing device from his jacket pocket. He tapped it against her forehead. "At this rate, you'll lose your head next."

Evelyn blinked in surprise, inspecting the phone. "How did you get this?"

"Police recovered it by the riverside and returned it to the registered owner."

Relief washed over her. "Thank heavens! I was terrified someone might drain your linked accounts. I couldn't possibly repay that."

"Nathaniel called her name abruptly.

"Yes?" She met his gaze, her pulse stuttering at the intensity in his dark eyes.

His voice dropped to a velvet murmur. "I never meant to cage you. There's no need for such defenses with me."

Evelyn froze.

His stern expression softened as he continued, "Keep your secrets. Maintain your social circles. But never disappear without word. What if something happened to you?"

As he spoke, his calloused fingers traced her cheekbone with reverent care, as though handling a priceless artifact.

His response threw her. The man balanced reprimand with reason, his usual ambiguity replaced by startling clarity. Was exhaustion making him sentimental?

Nathaniel's gaze traveled over her features - the defiant arch of her brows, the stubborn set of her mouth. A week apart had been manageable through distraction, but now...

Physical contact shattered his restraint. The smoldering desire he'd suppressed ignited uncontrollably. Crushing her against him, he claimed her lips with desperate hunger.
###Chapter 272

Nathaniel's arm snaked around Evelyn's waist, pulling her flush against him. The thin fabric of their clothes did little to mask the heat between them.

Their breaths mingled, lips hovering dangerously close. The sudden intimacy sent Evelyn's pulse racing with equal parts irritation and unwanted attraction.

'What game is he playing? Amelia just walked out!' Had she not seen Amelia in that revealing nightgown, knowing they'd spent the night together, she might have mistaken this for genuine affection.

But the truth burned in her mind - he'd been with Amelia all night. Yet here he was, still having the audacity to tease her.

'Typical man!' Evelyn jerked her head away, nearly straining her neck in the process. She planted both hands on Nathaniel's chest and shoved hard.

Taking two deliberate steps back, she crossed her arms. "Message received, Mr. Grayson. Next time I'll send you my itinerary in triplicate. No need for this... performance."

Nathaniel straightened, his heated gaze cooling instantly at her words.

'This infuriating woman can't take a hint!'

"And what exactly is my message?" His voice carried equal parts frustration and lingering desire.

"Everything." Evelyn met his stare without flinching. She refused to spell it out.

He'd made his position clear - she could have anything except his heart. No point reading into his actions. After careful consideration, she'd realized his concern stemmed from pure self-interest.

When their three-month arrangement ended, Nathaniel would simply be divorced if she survived. But if his temporary wife died? That made him a widower - complicating his precious reunion with Amelia.

Wealthy families like the Rivers would never accept their golden girl becoming a replacement bride. The Grayson-Rivera feud had enough drama without adding that taboo.

Nathaniel was simply avoiding future headaches. No need to voice what they both understood.

After a beat, Evelyn adopted a businesslike tone. "I'd appreciate it if you didn't bring Miss Rivers here overnight again."

Nathaniel's eyebrows shot up. "And why is that?"

'Could she actually be jealous?'

Evelyn shrugged. "You own half the city's real estate. If not, hotels exist. Sleep with her anywhere but here. Having your mistress under our roof makes maintaining this charade unnecessarily difficult."

She gestured sharply. "The staff aren't blind. Should I play the offended wife or pretend not to care? Either way, when the elders hear rumors, they'll discover our marriage is fake. And you'll be the one dealing with that fallout."
###Chapter 273

Nathaniel's voice was icy as he repeated, "You wouldn't care if I slept with her anywhere outside this house?"

Evelyn shrugged. "Exactly."

In that moment, Nathaniel's expression darkened like storm clouds gathering. A chilling laugh escaped his throat, sending shivers down her spine.

Having said her piece, Evelyn moved toward the guest room. She patted Nathaniel's shoulder like an old friend, adopting a mock-concerned tone. "You must be exhausted from last night's... activities. Get some rest—don't push yourself too hard just because you've got a pretty new plaything."

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed dangerously. "What exactly do you think happened last night?"

Evelyn smirked. "What I'm saying, darling, is that even someone as... vigorous as you should practice moderation. Too much indulgence ages you prematurely." With that, she sauntered past him toward the guest room.

Before she could take three steps, Nathaniel grabbed the back of her collar. In one swift motion, he lifted her like a sack of potatoes and carried her into the bathroom, slamming and locking the door behind them.

Evelyn found herself unceremoniously dumped into the bathtub. Before she could react, freezing water cascaded over her from the showerhead. She sputtered, coughing as the unexpected deluge soaked her completely. "Have you lost your mind?" she gasped, gripping the tub's edge.

Nathaniel loomed over her, his gaze glacial. "Your mind seems clouded with nonsense. Thought you could use some cold water to clear it."

"My mind is perfectly clear—unlike yours!" Evelyn shot back, struggling to stand in the slippery tub.

Her cheap slippers provided no traction. As she attempted to climb out, her feet slid out from under her. She braced for impact with the hard tiles—only to be caught mid-fall by Nathaniel.

The position was absurdly intimate. Before she could disentangle herself, Nathaniel's large hands gripped her waist. He spun them around and deposited her onto the bathroom counter.

Still dripping wet, Evelyn instinctively wrapped her arms around Nathaniel's neck for balance, then immediately released him when seated. She tried to slide off, but he caged her in, arms braced on either side of the sink, his body pressing between her parted legs.

Her soaked clothes clung to every curve, leaving nothing to imagination. "Let me go!" she demanded, face burning.

Nathaniel leaned in until his lips brushed her ear. "Since you're so convinced of my... appetites, perhaps I should demonstrate what real indulgence looks like."

Evelyn's breath hitched. "I—I was joking! Can't you take a joke?"

He pinned her wrists above her head, tilting her chin up with his other hand. His voice dropped to a dangerous purr. "You're right. I don't do jokes. I'm deadly serious."

His intense gaze and the raw heat radiating from him sent Evelyn's pulse racing. She squeezed her eyes shut, unable to meet that smoldering stare.

"Ow—that hurts!" she protested as his grip tightened.
###Chapter 274

"Ah! It burns! Nathaniel—stop!" Evelyn's voice quivered as she clenched her teeth against the pain. Her face drained of color, her body swaying dangerously.

Nathaniel froze mid-motion, his brows furrowing. He hadn't even touched her yet. This was supposed to be just playful retaliation for her sharp tongue earlier.

"Where does it hurt?" His voice dropped an octave.

Evelyn's lashes fluttered, eyes watering. "My hands—"

Nathaniel's gaze snapped to where he'd pinned her wrists against the mirror. His breath hitched. Both hands had swollen to twice their size, the skin an angry crimson.

"What happened?" His fingers traced the inflamed skin gently. "What did you do to yourself?"

Evelyn shook her head weakly. "Nothing... I didn't..."

The burning intensified, like molten lava beneath her skin. Beads of sweat dotted her forehead as her throat constricted. The last thing she heard was Nathaniel's urgent voice calling her name before darkness swallowed her.

When consciousness returned, sterile white walls greeted her. An IV drip hung beside the hospital bed, its rhythmic clicking the only sound. Her mouth tasted like cotton, her bandaged hands useless lumps of gauze.

The empty room triggered memories—being seven years old, abandoned in another hospital ward while her mother vanished forever. She watched the IV fluid drip, counting seconds until—

"Evelyn! You're awake!" Sophia burst in, relief painting her features. "I just stepped out for five minutes. Why are you crying?"

Evelyn forced a smile. "Just... slept wrong." Her voice scraped like sandpaper.

Sophia adjusted the pillows. "Should I call the doctor?"

"No." Evelyn eyed the water glass longingly. "Help me sit up? I'm parched."

With careful movements, Sophia propped her up and held the straw to her lips. Evelyn hated being helpless, but her mummified hands left no choice. The cool water soothed her raw throat, but the humiliation burned hotter than her injuries.
###Chapter 275

Evelyn's throat felt much better after drinking several glasses of water. She leaned back against the hospital bed and studied Sophia.

"Why are you here?" she asked.

Sophia set down her phone before answering. "Uncle Nathaniel called and asked me to hurry over after buying you some fresh, comfortable undergarments. I came as soon as I got everything."

Undergarments? Evelyn glanced down at herself, heat creeping up her neck.

She remembered being locked in the bathroom by Nathaniel, drenched and shivering before passing out.

Though she now wore a hospital gown, the clothes beneath were dry—and clearly changed.

"Who... changed me?" she asked warily.

Sophia grinned. "Me! I took off your wet clothes too."

Relief washed over Evelyn. "Oh. Good."

Sophia tilted her head. "Though Nathaniel did help a little. I couldn't hold you up and dress you at the same time."

Evelyn's face burned. "Did he... see everything?"

Sophia waved a hand. "No, no! He wanted to, but I made him turn away. You two might be married, but mystery keeps things exciting!"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Sophia and her ridiculous ideas...

Sophia's expression turned serious as she took Evelyn's hands—still swollen and red. "Your allergy's worse than usual. What triggered it?"

Evelyn frowned. "No idea. Must've brushed against something by accident."

Silver was her only severe allergen. A tiny earring had once made her palms swell. This reaction meant heavy exposure, yet she couldn't recall touching anything silver—not in the taxi, not at home.

"Be more careful!" Sophia scolded. "Do you know how terrified we were finding you unconscious?"

"I will." Evelyn scanned the room, frowning.

Sophia smirked. "Looking for Uncle Nathaniel?"

Evelyn didn't deny it. "Where is he?"

Truthfully, she wasn't eager to see him. She just wondered if he'd dumped her here to avoid responsibility.

Sophia hesitated. "Well... Amelia had a car accident and was brought to this hospital. Benjamin called Nathaniel to see her."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. "I see."

Sophia bit her lip. "Are you hungry? I can get you something."

Evelyn shook her head. "Not yet."

Sophia fidgeted. "Don't be upset. He'll be back soon."

Evelyn forced a smile. "I'm not angry."

Illness made emotions raw, but anger wasn't what she felt. She just wanted to go home—her home, with Seraphina and Sebastian—to curl up with little Mia and lose herself in music.

The door swung open.

Nathaniel strode in, tall and composed. Behind him stood Amelia, still in her hospital gown.
###Chapter 276

"Uncle Nathaniel! You're back!" Sophia immediately sprang up from the hospital bed to make space for Nathaniel the moment she spotted him entering.

Her cheerful expression faltered when she noticed Amelia trailing behind him. Instinctively, she glanced at Evelyn to gauge her reaction.

Evelyn's face remained impassive, showing no visible change in emotion.

"Did you just wake up?"

Nathaniel approached the bedside with measured steps. His posture was impeccable, hands tucked casually into his trouser pockets. His gaze, cool and unreadable, settled on her.

"Yes." Evelyn nodded briefly, meeting Nathaniel's striking eyes before shifting her attention to Amelia standing beside him.

Nathaniel seemed to anticipate her unspoken question. He turned slightly toward Amelia before addressing Evelyn in a softened tone. "She wanted to see you."

Sophia, standing off to the side, let out an almost imperceptible scoff.

Amelia, like Evelyn, was clad in a loose hospital gown. A bandage wrapped around her forehead accentuated her delicate frame, making her appear even more fragile—the very image of someone in need of tender care.

Yet, there was no trace of arrogance in her demeanor. She stepped forward with an easy smile, concern lacing her voice. "Nathaniel mentioned you were hospitalized due to allergies. I was worried, so I came along to check on you. How are you feeling now?"

Evelyn responded politely, "Thank you for your concern. I'm much better. What about you, Miss Amelia? You seem injured as well. Are you alright?"

Amelia touched the bandage on her forehead with a resigned sigh. "It's nothing serious—just a minor car accident. A scrape on the head, really. But my family insisted I stay for observation. They can be so overprotective!" Her tone carried playful exasperation, as if she were helpless against their doting.

That very helplessness, however, subtly underscored how cherished she was—someone who had never lacked love or comfort in her life.

Evelyn offered a faint smile but said nothing.

Amelia glanced around the room, her expression shifting to mild confusion. "Where’s your family, Evelyn? Shouldn’t they be here with you?"

Evelyn’s expression darkened slightly at the question.

Family? I don’t have one. Only recently had she discovered Gregory wasn’t her biological father, which meant even Cassandra, whom she’d always considered her half-sister, shared no blood with her. And the Whitmores in the countryside? They were strangers now.

In truth, she had no relatives left.

Evelyn remained silent, but Sophia stepped in, her tone defensive. "That’s a strange question, Miss Amelia. Uncle Nathaniel and I are her family. We’re right here with her!"

Amelia blinked innocently. "Oh, you misunderstood me, Sophia. Of course, you and Nathaniel are her family. I just meant—shouldn’t her own relatives be here too?"

Sophia, unaware of Evelyn’s complicated past, frowned. "We’re enough. No need to trouble anyone else."

Amelia shook her head gently. "But keeping it from them isn’t right. Allergies this severe must be uncomfortable. Having loved ones nearby would help her recover faster."

Sophia hesitated, then turned to Evelyn. "Would you like your family to come? Should Uncle Nathaniel arrange for someone to bring them?"

Evelyn shook her head. "It’s just a minor issue. I’ll be fine in a few days. No need to bother them."

Sophia nodded obediently and dropped the subject.

Amelia, however, wasn’t satisfied. She turned to Nathaniel with a worried expression. "Even if Evelyn says it’s nothing, I still think her family should be informed."
###Chapter 277

Nathaniel paused, watching Evelyn's reaction to Amelia's words. He knew the young woman had grown up in rural isolation with minimal connection to the Whitmores, but if she desired to see them, he would arrange it.

"Appreciate the thought, but I don't consider myself to have any family," Evelyn stated flatly.

Amelia blinked in surprise. "Oh... I'm so sorry, Evelyn. I didn't realize—"

"Don't worry about it." Evelyn's lips curved slightly. Truthfully, having no family was preferable to being tied to people like the Whitmores.

Touched by Evelyn's gracious response, Amelia stepped closer and gently grasped one of Evelyn's bandaged hands. "You're so kind-hearted. Isn't it strange how we both wound up hospitalized on the day we met? Please think of me as your sister now. If you need anything at all—"

She cradled the swollen hand carefully, emotions warring between amusement and concern. "They may hurt, but your hands look absolutely adorable like this! Like little marshmallows!"

Evelyn studied Amelia's affectionate gestures silently before glancing down at her own hands. A realization struck her sharply. She'd confirmed no exposure to obvious allergens before her reaction—the only person besides Nathaniel who'd touched her hands was Amelia. Twice.

First at Silver Moon Estate's gates, then again just now. That initial contact had made her uncomfortable, but she'd been too polite to refuse the second time. Could this sweet-faced woman have done something to her?

"At least we can keep each other company during our hospital stay!" Amelia beamed.

Evelyn's gaze remained thoughtful as she examined Amelia's guileless expression.

Sophia Bennett interjected sharply, "Hospitals aren't social clubs. The doctor ordered two days' complete rest for Evelyn. She won't be entertaining visitors."

Amelia flushed. "Of course... How thoughtless of me."

"Because you're practically a permanent resident with your delicate constitution," Sophia retorted bluntly.

Amelia's doe eyes shimmered as she lowered her head like a chastened child.

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "Mind your manners, Sophia."

Sophia pressed her lips together. "I'm not wrong."

Checking her watch, Amelia lifted her head with a soft smile. "I should return before my family worries. I've taken enough of Evelyn's time."

Nathaniel gave a curt nod.

After bidding Evelyn farewell, Amelia turned toward the door. At the threshold, she paused helplessly. "Oh dear... I've forgotten the way back. Nathaniel, would you mind—"

Before he could move, a swollen hand clumsily seized his.

Nathaniel stilled, turning to find Evelyn gripping him with unexpected determination burning in her eyes.
###Chapter 278

Evelyn didn't speak. She simply gripped Nathaniel's hand, her steady gaze locked onto his face. The silent challenge hung between them - it was his move now.

Two heartbeats passed before Nathaniel turned to Sophia. "Would you mind escorting Miss Amelia back to her room?"

Sophia's lips pursed in displeasure, but she understood the unspoken dynamics. If she refused, Evelyn would be upset because Nathaniel would have to go. As Evelyn's staunchest ally, she couldn't let that happen!

"Fine, Uncle Nathaniel. I'll make sure Miss Amelia gets back safely - with all the politeness I can muster!" With visible reluctance, Sophia approached Amelia.

"Come on. You're stuck with me since Uncle Nathaniel is... occupied."

Amelia's wide, innocent eyes lingered on Evelyn's hand entwined with Nathaniel's. A flicker of something dark passed through them before she blinked and smiled at Sophia. "Do you even know where my room is?"

Sophia shrugged. "I've got a working mouth and there are nurses everywhere. It's not rocket science."

For a split second, Amelia's expression twisted before smoothing into practiced sweetness. "You're absolutely right. Let's go."

Before leaving, Amelia fixed Evelyn with that saccharine smile. "Get well soon, Evelyn. I'll visit again tomorrow."

Evelyn gave a curt nod. "You should rest too."

Amelia's gaze then shifted to Nathaniel, brimming with affection. "I'll see you later, darling."

Nathaniel merely nodded. "Mm."

The door clicked shut behind them, leaving Evelyn alone with Nathaniel. He studied their still-connected hands, warmth creeping into his eyes as he tilted his head at her. "Well?"

Evelyn released him immediately.

This had been a test. Simple-minded heiresses like Sophia or Abigail wore their emotions openly. But Amelia? She'd maintained that perfect smile even when seeing Evelyn holding Nathaniel's hand. The mask never slipped.

That told Evelyn everything she needed to know.

She didn't care about Amelia's true nature - only whether the woman had orchestrated her allergic reaction. Today's little experiment confirmed Amelia was dangerous, but proving she'd tampered with the flowers? That would take more.

The real surprise? Nathaniel staying. One tug from her, and he'd chosen to remain rather than escort his precious Amelia.

"You stopped me from seeing her out, and now this cold shoulder?" Nathaniel's voice dripped with displeasure as he loomed over her bed. "Explain yourself, Evelyn."

Evelyn met his piercing gaze. Time for damage control. "I just remembered something I need from you."

Nathaniel's lips quirked. Finally, he settled onto the edge of her bed with effortless grace, crossing his long legs like a king holding court. "Go on."
###Chapter 279

Evelyn licked her lips thoughtfully. "There's a slice of cake I baked for myself in the fridge back home."

She turned to Nathaniel with hopeful eyes. "Could you ask Lucas to bring it for me? I'm having a sudden craving."

Nathaniel's expression darkened instantly. "That's all you want?"

Evelyn nodded casually. "Yeah. Just the cake."

His jaw tensed visibly as he studied her face. After a heavy pause, he leaned closer. "If there's anything you want to know, ask me now. I'll tell you everything."

"Nope." Evelyn deliberately avoided his gaze, staring out the window while feigning a yawn.

She had no right to interrogate him. Their marriage was temporary anyway - prying would only make her seem intrusive.

Nathaniel's fingers twitched at his sides. If not for her bandaged, swollen hands, he would've grabbed her shoulders and shaken some sense into her.

This infuriating woman!

Gritting his teeth, he rubbed his temples in frustration before gently taking her injured hand in his. "Has the swelling gone down? Does it still hurt?"

Evelyn flinched at the sudden contact, pulling her hand slightly. "It's manageable."

The temperature in the car seemed to drop several degrees. Nathaniel's lips pressed into a thin line.

No one could kill the mood quite like Evelyn Whitmore.

With a resigned sigh, he tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear. "Relax. I won't let anything happen to you."

Evelyn turned her face away, closing her eyes. "Yeah, you won't let me die..." Her voice trailed off. 'At least not during these three months.'
###Chapter 280

When Evelyn finally stirred awake, darkness had already blanketed the sky outside her hospital window.

The antihistamines had knocked her out cold, sending her into a deep, dreamless sleep. Though her swollen hands still ached, she managed to prop herself up against the pillows.

Her bleary eyes scanned the dimly lit room, landing on a broad-shouldered figure lounging on the visitor's sofa.

She startled.

Nathaniel.

He sat with a laptop balanced on his knees, fingers flying across the keyboard. The blue glow of the screen highlighted his sharp jawline as he rested his forehead against one hand, completely absorbed in his work.

"You're awake." He didn't even glance up, yet somehow knew she'd opened her eyes.

Evelyn rubbed her face. "Why are you still here?"

Nathaniel finally looked up, reaching for his coffee cup. "Didn't someone demand I stay until they woke up?"

Her nose scrunched. "I said you could leave when Sophia got back. Where is she?"

"Lucas took her home." His voice was rough with fatigue.

Evelyn's stomach dropped. That left just the two of them in this sterile hospital room.

One dark eyebrow arched. "Problem? Not thrilled about your sleeping companion?"

The way he said "sleeping companion" made her cheeks burn.

She was disappointed, yes, but what could she do? Sophia had already left.

A sigh escaped her lips as she caught Nathaniel using a fork to eat something while typing. Her stomach growled loudly after sleeping through meals. "What are you eating?"

"Cake." He didn't miss a keystroke.

'Cake? Since when does Nathaniel Grayson eat sweets?'

Then it hit her. She bolted upright. "Is that my chestnut cake?"

"Mmhmm."

"That's mine! I was saving that! Who said you could—"

"You were unconscious," he interrupted smoothly. "It would've gone bad sitting out."

Evelyn scrambled out of bed. "Well I'm awake now! Hand it over!"

"Come get it." A challenge glinted in his tired eyes.

With a huff, she marched over—only to find a single pathetic slice remaining. He'd eaten nearly the whole thing!

Her hands shot out to grab the plate, but Nathaniel pinned it to the table with two long fingers. "Sit. Share."

"It's mine!" She glared, protective of her last precious bite.

His gaze turned predatory. "So I'm not allowed any?"

"You've had plenty!" She tugged at the plate, but he held firm.

Nathaniel's grip tightened, pulling her closer until their faces were inches apart. "This is how you thank the man who rushed you to the hospital? Who sat by your bedside all day?"

She refused to back down. "There's only one piece left! I'll make you another one later!"

"Deal." He released the plate so suddenly she stumbled forward, chin colliding with his collarbone.

The cake didn't fall—Nathaniel caught it effortlessly with his free hand.

Her face burned where it had brushed against his stubble. She jerked back, rubbing her cheek. "Ugh! When was the last time you shaved?"

A dangerous smirk curved his lips. One arm snaked around her waist, dragging her against him as he deliberately rubbed his rough jaw against her soft skin.

"Stop! Enough!" She squirmed, face flaming.

He released her with a tired exhale. "Haven't had time. Been awake for forty-eight hours straight."

Evelyn froze. 'Two days without sleep?'
###Chapter 281

"Oh, he didn't sleep at all because he and Amelia had spent the night discovering life's greatest miracle!"

Evelyn remembered.

Nathaniel's expression darkened when he saw the disgust flashing across her face. "Do I repulse you? All men grow facial hair, you know."

She snapped out of her thoughts, pushing away from him and putting some distance between them. "No. The beard suits you."

Whether he kept it or shaved it off was none of her business, so her opinion hardly mattered.

"You think I'm attractive then?" Heat flashed in Nathaniel's eyes—compliments from her were rare treasures.

Evelyn remained impassive. "Your looks are objectively good. My personal view changes nothing."

"Is that why you're always so cold toward me?"

"Should I throw myself at every handsome man I meet? The world's full of them—shall I cozy up to each one?"

Nathaniel's face clouded over. He yanked her back, depositing her unceremoniously on the sofa before shoving the cake box toward her. "Stop that nonsense. Eat."

Evelyn huffed as she landed awkwardly. 'Fine, I'll eat your damn cake!'

Her bandaged hands made gripping the fork difficult, but not impossible.

Abandoning further protest, she focused on eating while occasionally stealing glances at Nathaniel's laptop screen. He'd returned to reviewing documents, his long fingers dancing across the keyboard to annotate files with practiced ease.

Boredom gnawed at her. Sucking frosting from her fork, she asked, "When can I leave this place, Nathaniel?"

"Three more days minimum."

'Three days? That's eternity!' Hospital stays grated on her nerves. "I'll recover fine at home if I avoid allergens. Please?"

He turned—just as she was about to take another bite. His brows lifted expectantly as he opened his mouth slightly.

Evelyn froze. 'Is he... demanding I feed him? And that glint in his eyes—is this some twisted negotiation tactic?'

Irritation flared, but three more days here was worse. She set down her untouched bite and reached for a clean fork.

Before she could grab one, his hand closed around her wrist. He pulled her closer and—without hesitation—ate directly from her fork.

Her pulse stuttered. Flustered, she tossed the contaminated utensil aside and snatched a new one.

Nathaniel scowled. "Am I that revolting?"

She wiped her mouth. "It's unsanitary. Sharing utensils is basically swapping germs! You might not care, but I do!"

A dark chuckle escaped him. "Too late for that. Our germ exchange happened long ago."

'Germ... exchange...' The unspoken reference to that drugged, feverish night made her cheeks burn. She'd tried so hard to forget it.

"Nathaniel!" she snapped.

Amusement danced in his eyes as he took in her flushed face. Reaching out, he ruffled her hair. "Enough. Don't overdo the sweets—proper food's coming soon."

Evelyn gaped. 'Is he bipolar? Stormy one minute, playful the next!' She turned away with a disgruntled huff.

Nathaniel seemed to enjoy riling her up whenever bored.

Her phone buzzed suddenly. Setting down her fork, she reached for Nathaniel's device—her temporary phone—where only Lucas and Dominic's numbers appeared regularly. This caller was unsaved.

With bandaged fingers making swiping difficult, she answered clumsily with her chin.

Amelia's terrified shrieks erupted from the speaker. "Help! Don't—stay back! Nathaniel! I'm scared! Come quick—"

Evelyn's frown deepened as she thrust the phone at Nathaniel. "Your Amelia's in trouble."
###Chapter 282

Nathaniel's sharp gaze lifted. "Who's calling?"

Evelyn realized he'd missed the urgency. She thrust the phone into his hand.

"Answer it now! She might be in danger!"

Nathaniel narrowed his eyes, studying her face for a long moment before pressing the phone to his ear.

The desperate plea on the other end made his composed expression fracture instantly. He shot to his feet. "Where are you? Don't move! I'm coming!"

He ended the call and turned to leave, then hesitated, locking eyes with Evelyn.

She waved him off. "Go. I'll manage."

His jaw tightened. "Stay put. I'll return shortly." Then he was gone.

Evelyn froze. Those words—"Stay put. I'll return shortly"—echoed in her mind like a ghost from the past. The last words her mother ever spoke to her in that hospital room.

Her mother never came back.

The clock ticked past an hour. Evelyn finished her dessert and mindlessly scrolled through social media. Still no sign of Nathaniel.

'What's taking so long? I don't even know Amelia's room number...'

Too restless to sleep, Evelyn slipped out of bed. The VIP floor was silent, most patients already asleep.

She moved quietly toward the nurses' station. Before she reached it, she spotted police officers reviewing surveillance footage with a senior doctor.

"No need to escort us," an officer said. "We appreciate your cooperation."

The doctor nodded. "Our pleasure. Thank you for responding so quickly."

"Duty calls," the officer replied before leaving.

Evelyn caught snippets of hushed conversation from the nurses:

"—a stalker! In our hospital!"

"Can you believe he targeted Miss Amelia from 3C2? The audacity!"

"They should castrate creeps like that!"

"I just checked on her—still shaking like a leaf. Poor thing won't stop crying in her boyfriend's arms."

"That billionaire who bought the LED ads along Yonder River? Is he as gorgeous as they say?"

"More so. Makes my knees weak just looking at him!"

"Knees weak? Or something else?"
###Chapter 283

"Don't be absurd! That man clearly holds a distinguished position and likely comes from a family background that perfectly matches Miss Amelia. They're practically made for each other!"

Evelyn overheard the nurses' conversation as she walked past their station. She could easily piece together what must have occurred. Some creep had been stalking Amelia, prompting her to call Nathaniel for help. By the time Nathaniel arrived, the stalker had fled.

Police officers were now reviewing hospital surveillance footage to identify potential suspects. The nurses had mentioned Amelia was in Ward 302, just around the next corner. Evelyn turned the corner and immediately spotted the ward number.

The door stood slightly ajar, revealing a crowded room filled with officers. From her vantage point, Evelyn had a clear view inside without needing to approach closer.

Amelia trembled against Nathaniel's chest, her shoulders shaking visibly. "Nathaniel, I'm terrified..."

Nathaniel wrapped a protective arm around her, his other hand gently stroking her back. "You're safe now. Just tell the officers what happened. Can you describe the man who followed you?"

Since Amelia couldn't visit the police station due to her hospitalization, the officers had come to take her statement at the hospital.

Nathaniel's calming presence seemed to steady Amelia. She took a deep breath before describing to the officers: "He wore... a striped shirt and glasses. Overweight. About one-point-seven meters tall..."

The lead officer nodded while writing. "Got it, Miss Rivers. We'll catch this guy, I promise."

"Thank you," Amelia murmured, instinctively pressing closer to Nathaniel as if he alone could shield her from the world's dangers.

"Please stay with me, Nathaniel. Don't leave me alone..."

"I'm not going anywhere."

Nathaniel whispered more reassurances as the officers finished their work. "We'll take our leave now, Mr. Grayson. You'll be the first to know about any developments."

Nathaniel gave a brief nod. "Gabrielle, please see the officers out."

Gabrielle stepped forward graciously. "Thank you for your help, officers. This way please. Safe travels."

Having confirmed nothing serious had happened, Evelyn quietly turned to leave. She'd seen enough.

"Evelyn! Is that you?" Gabrielle's sharp voice cut through the hallway as she spotted a familiar figure walking away. She hurried after Evelyn, confirming her suspicion.

Evelyn faced Gabrielle calmly. "Good evening, Miss Winslow."

Gabrielle's gaze flickered between Evelyn and the partially open door where Amelia still clung to Nathaniel. A smug smile spread across her face. "You saw everything, didn't you? I warned you Amelia's return would put you in your place!"

Evelyn's lips curled slightly. She'd never held any real position in Nathaniel's life to begin with. What difference did it make?

Gabrielle crossed her arms triumphantly. "They've known each other since childhood. That kind of bond can't be broken by some temporary distraction like you."

Recognizing Gabrielle's attempt to provoke her, Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Don't you have better things to do than meddle in other people's affairs?"

Gabrielle's expression soured when she failed to elicit the expected reaction. "Hmph! Just wait until Nathaniel discards you. I hope you won't make too pathetic a scene when it happens!"

"And who exactly are you speaking to?" A smooth, masculine voice interrupted from behind Evelyn.
###Chapter 284

Evelyn's eyes sparkled with recognition as the familiar voice reached her ears. Her entire demeanor softened instantly.

"Samuel, you came!"

The sudden shift in Gabrielle's expression made Evelyn turn around to see who had arrived.

The man standing behind her was impeccably dressed in a tailored slate-gray suit, his tall frame exuding effortless elegance. His features were striking—sharp yet warm, with an artist's precision in every line. His gaze held a quiet intensity, the kind that spoke of privilege and detachment from ordinary concerns. He carried himself like someone who had never known what it meant to want for anything.

Their eyes met, and recognition flickered in his expression. "You?"

Evelyn recognized him immediately—the grandson of the blind elderly man she had helped the day before.

Gabrielle's smile tightened as she watched them exchange glances. "Do you two know each other?"

Samuel barely spared Gabrielle a glance before turning his attention back to Evelyn. "Your name is Evelyn?"

She nodded. "That's right."

Without another word, Samuel gestured to his assistant, Oliver, who handed him a sleek leather wallet. He pulled out a checkbook, signed it with practiced ease, and tore off the slip before offering it to Evelyn.

"I heard you weren't satisfied with the amount yesterday," he said smoothly. "See if this meets your expectations."

Evelyn glanced down at the check. This time, the figure was clear—750,000 dollars. A significant jump from before.

Gabrielle stared in stunned silence, confusion knitting her brows. She wanted to demand an explanation but held her tongue, not daring to interrupt.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Do you really think seven hundred fifty thousand can buy a person's self-respect?"

Samuel's expression remained unreadable, his smile polished and cold. "Generally speaking, most people's dignity doesn't come at such a high price."

Her gaze sharpened. "So what you're saying is, as long as the price is right, anyone can be bought?"

His smile didn't waver. "Essentially, yes."

Evelyn took the check between her bandaged fingers, brought it to her nose, and inhaled deeply. A slow, deliberate smile curved her lips. "Money does have a lovely scent. Is this really for me?"

"Consider it yours." A flicker of disdain crossed Samuel's eyes as he watched her reaction. He had thought she might be different, but it seemed even she wasn't immune to the lure of wealth.

The amount was more than generous.

Without warning, Evelyn snatched the check back from Samuel's hand, her lips curling into a smirk. "This sum could support an average person for decades. But you—" Her gaze swept over him deliberately. "With that face and pedigree? I'll consider this payment for keeping you away from me for a full year."

Samuel stiffened. Did she just—?

Never in his thirty-two years had anyone dared speak to him like this.

Beside him, his secretary Oliver tensed, ready to intervene. Gabrielle's face flushed with outrage. "Have you lost your mind, Evelyn? How dare you—"

A raised hand silenced them both.

Samuel studied the check now back in his possession, his expression darkening. "Miss Whitmore," he said slowly, "you saved my grandfather's life yesterday. This is merely a token of gratitude. Are you certain you wish to refuse it?"

Evelyn tilted her head. "Oh, I'm taking it. Consider it compensation for enduring your presence today."

Samuel's smile turned glacial. "And how exactly do you plan to spend seven hundred fifty thousand dollars to avoid me?"

"Simple." Her voice dropped to a blade's edge. "Stay out of my sight for twelve months."

The air between them crackled.

Samuel's aristocratic composure fractured. Behind him, Oliver and Gabrielle gaped.

None of them noticed the broad-shouldered figure leaning against the doorframe of Room 302.

Nathaniel had recognized Evelyn's voice the moment it carried down the hallway. What he hadn't expected was witnessing her dismantle Samuel Rivers—the so-called "Silver Fox" of Wall Street who'd outmaneuvered Nathaniel in three major deals last quarter—with nothing but words and a dismissive flick of her wrist.

The corner of his mouth twitched. He'd pay double to see this scene again.
###Chapter 285

Evelyn left Nathaniel utterly speechless with just a few sharp words.

Nathaniel leaned casually against the doorframe, fingers hooked loosely on his belt. A proud smirk played on his lips as he watched his wife outmaneuver Samuel. 'That's my woman,' he thought with satisfaction.

He pushed off the wall and approached. "Why aren't you resting in your room?"

Evelyn noticed Nathaniel had emerged from Room 302 and was walking toward her. She frowned in displeasure. "I've slept enough. Came to check if you were still breathing."

Nathaniel's expression darkened briefly, but he'd grown accustomed to her biting remarks. His large hand came down to ruffle her hair playfully. "Sorry to disappoint, but I'm still alive. Were you hoping otherwise?"

Evelyn sidestepped his touch smoothly. She couldn't stand his hands on her after seeing them wrapped around another woman. Fatigue tugged at her, so she waved her bandaged hands dismissively. "Carry on without me. I'm done with this conversation."

She turned on her heel and walked away.

Nathaniel followed without hesitation, but Amelia suddenly rushed out to clutch his sleeve. Tears welled in her eyes. "Don't go, Nathaniel! Stay with me. I'm scared..."

Nathaniel paused, his gaze shifting from Amelia to her brother Samuel. "My family has strict rules. It's inappropriate for me to care for your sister."

Samuel's eyes dimmed slightly before nodding gracefully. "Understood."

Nathaniel gently detached Amelia's grip. "Your brother's here. Rest well." With that, he strode after Evelyn, who'd already put considerable distance between them.

Amelia tried to follow, but Samuel caught her arm. "Enough, Amelia. He's married now."

"But it's just a marriage of convenience!" Amelia protested tearfully. "He never wanted—"

Samuel's voice turned firm. "The reason doesn't matter. He's taken. You're a good girl—don't chase after married men."

Amelia burst into sobs. "Samuel, I need him! I'm terrified..."

Samuel pulled his distraught sister into a comforting embrace. "I'm here. You're safe."

As Amelia's cries gradually subsided to sniffles, Samuel's phone rang. He checked the caller ID, his expression darkening. Turning to Gabrielle, who'd been watching him adoringly, he said, "Could you take Amelia back to her room? Stay with her while I handle this."

Gabrielle blushed and nodded eagerly. "Of course, Samuel. I'll take good care of her."

Once they'd disappeared into the ward, Samuel answered the call. His subordinate's voice came through: "Sir, the DNA results are back on the two female remains found in Westridge Valley. No match to your samples. They're not the missing madam and young lady."

"Keep searching. I need definitive proof of their fate."

"Understood."

Samuel massaged his temples after hanging up. Fifteen years had passed since his mother fled with his five-year-old sister during family conflicts, vanishing without a trace. Most believed them dead, but Samuel wouldn't stop until he found their remains—or them alive.

He turned to his secretary. "Oliver, investigate Evelyn's background. She's clearly formidable, and I won't have her bullying Amelia."

"Yes, sir." Oliver hesitated before adding, "It explains why she rejected your check. She's playing for higher stakes—securing her position as Mrs. Grayson and the family fortune. I fear Miss Amelia stands no chance now..."

Samuel's eyes narrowed. Even without Evelyn, uniting the Rivers and Grayson families would be nearly impossible given their generations-old feud. The younger generation might coexist civilly, but the elders would never sanction such a union.

His sister had fallen for the one man she could never have.
###Chapter 286

The sterile hospital hallway echoed with Evelyn's hurried footsteps as she rushed past the nursing station. Nathaniel followed close behind, his long strides easily keeping pace.

The nurses' excited whispers trailed after them.

"That's him! The man from Room 302!"
"Goodness, he's even more handsome up close!"
"But why is he chasing after another woman instead of staying with Miss Amelia?"
"Don't tell me this is some messy love triangle situation..."

Evelyn's jaw tightened at their gossip. Annoyance flared through her as she quickened her pace.

She reached her private ward and moved to slam the door shut, but Nathaniel's hand shot out to block it. "What's gotten into you?" His voice came through the narrow gap.

"You shouldn't be here," Evelyn snapped, pushing against the door with all her strength.

"Give me one good reason why not," Nathaniel demanded, his expression darkening.

Evelyn paused. "Fine. Move your hand and I'll tell you."

Trusting fool that he was, Nathaniel withdrew his hand—only for the door to slam shut in his face. The distinct click of the lock followed.

For a moment, Nathaniel stood frozen in disbelief.

"Open this door right now!" His knuckles rapped sharply against the wood, patience wearing thin.

Silence.

"Evelyn Whitmore, I'm not asking again!" Nathaniel growled.

Still nothing.

Nathaniel exhaled sharply, running a hand through his hair. He swallowed his pride.

"Sweetheart, please open the door?" His voice took on an uncharacteristically sweet tone. "At least tell me what's wrong? I know I messed up by being late. Punish me however you want, darling—"

The sudden clearing of a throat made Nathaniel whirl around. Lucas stood there holding a takeout bag, looking awkward.

"Sir, there was traffic... The food got cold so I went back for a fresh order. It's still hot—"

Nathaniel glared. The timing couldn't have been worse.

Lucas wisely set the food on a hallway chair. "I'll just leave this here. Call if you need anything else, sir." He practically fled.

Nathaniel sank onto the chair with a sigh, pulling out his phone.

[Amelia saved my life ten years ago. She's been sickly ever since. I owe her everything.]

Evelyn read the message in her room. After a beat, she replied: [Then go be with her. Leave me alone.]

[Let me in. I'll explain properly.]

[I'm sleeping. Go to your precious savior.]

[Open the door.]

Silence.

Nathaniel waited a full minute before sending one last message: [Lucas brought barbecue.]

Three seconds later, the lock clicked open.

Nathaniel's expression darkened as he picked up the takeout. "Unbelievable," he muttered. "Only food can lure her out."

Evelyn ripped open the container—then scowled. "Where's my barbecue?"

Nathaniel leaned against the windowsill, unrepentant. "Doctor's orders. Light food only after an allergic reaction."

"You liar!" But hunger won out, and Evelyn began eating the chicken soup.

Nathaniel watched silently until she set down her spoon. "Finished? We need to talk—"

"I don't want to hear it."

His jaw tightened. "Then why did you lock me out?"
###Chapter 287

"I didn't want to give the nurses gossip material or get tangled in some messy love triangle with you and Miss Amelia. No woman wants to be labeled as the other woman."

Nathaniel understood her reasoning, which only made him more frustrated. "Evelyn, aren't you even going to ask what really happened? Your assumptions are wrong."

Evelyn remained composed. "I don't need explanations. This isn't like you. People might start thinking you actually have feelings for me—"

Nathaniel's eyes darkened. He suddenly cupped her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. "There's no one else here. Who exactly are you referring to?"

Evelyn fell silent.

Nathaniel grabbed tissues and gently wiped soup from her lips. "Go on then. Who are these people you're worried about?"

Evelyn pushed his hand away. "Fine! Maybe I'm the one thinking you like me! Anyone would assume that from how you've been acting!"

Nathaniel tightened his grip, bringing his face dangerously close. "What if that's exactly what I want you to think?"

Evelyn froze. "Mr. Grayson, this isn't funny. At all."

Internally, she recoiled. 'How can he say this after publicly declaring his love for Amelia yesterday? Does he think I'm stupid?'

Nathaniel studied her skeptical expression. "You're right—this isn't me. My past self would never believe some girl could make me act this way."

'Make him act what way?' Evelyn nearly scoffed when Nathaniel pressed a finger to her lips. "Don't speak. Just listen."

She waited, wary.

Nathaniel's expression turned serious. "I once said I could give you everything except my heart. That changed when I met you. I'm telling you this because I'm not afraid of your reaction. You're the only woman I've ever been with. That night wasn't just about the drugs—I already had feelings for you."

Evelyn's breath hitched. "Are you... joking?"

His frustration showed. "I haven't slept in two days. Don't test me further."

Exhausted, he released her and rested his head on the sofa arm, eyes closing instantly.

Despite herself, Evelyn's chest tightened seeing his fatigue. She fetched her blanket and draped it over him.

Studying his handsome features, she thought, 'At least sleeping with him was a win.' As she leaned closer, his eyes snapped open.

"Mr. Grayson! You're awake?"

"Trying to steal a kiss?" he teased.

"As if!" she retorted.

Nathaniel traced her cheek. "Evelyn, don't shut me out again."

"But I let you in," she countered.

"Your heart," he murmured before falling asleep.

Evelyn stared, emotions in turmoil.

Morning came with Evelyn nuzzling what she thought was her pillow—until she realized it was Nathaniel's arm. His amused gaze told her he'd been watching.

"How... did we end up like this?" she stammered.

A knock saved her. Nathaniel answered to find Amelia holding a thermos.

"Mother made too much soup," Amelia said sweetly. "I thought Evelyn might like some."

Nathaniel glanced back. "Want some?"

Evelyn shook her head sharply—she didn't trust Amelia's sudden kindness.

"Doctor's orders," Nathaniel explained. "Allergy restrictions."

Amelia nodded apologetically. "How thoughtless of me."

Suddenly, police officers entered.

"Miss Whitmore, you need to come with us for questioning regarding illegal activities."

Evelyn paled. "What?"
###Chapter 288

Evelyn frowned. "What illegal activities?" The confusion was evident on her face.

Nathaniel stepped forward, his voice low and controlled. "Which case are you referring to?"

The officers startled at his sudden presence. "Mr. Grayson, you know Miss Whitmore?"

His gaze hardened. "I do. What's your business with her?"

Amelia trembled beside him, memories of last night's horror flooding back. She clutched Nathaniel's arm desperately. "Officers, there must be some mistake. Evelyn would never—"

The policemen exchanged glances. "Miss Rivers, you're here too? Then you both know Miss Whitmore."

Deciding transparency was best, the lead officer continued. "Mr. Grayson, we've apprehended the man who assaulted Miss Rivers last night. During interrogation, he confessed Evelyn Whitmore paid him fifteen thousand dollars to commit the crime."

The thermos Amelia held crashed to the floor, hot soup splashing dangerously close to her feet. Nathaniel yanked her back just in time.

"No... that's impossible!" Amelia's voice broke. "Evelyn's my friend. She wouldn't—"

The officers gave her pitying looks. "Miss Rivers, people aren't always who they appear to be."

Amelia swayed, her fragile form shaking. She turned pleading eyes to Nathaniel. "Tell me this isn't true. Evelyn wouldn't hurt me... would she?"

Nathaniel's gaze flicked to Evelyn, who leaned casually against the hospital bed. Her expression clearly said 'I warned you.' This marriage would never let her live peacefully.

After a charged silence, Nathaniel addressed the officers. "Unless you have concrete evidence, you're not taking her anywhere."

The policemen stiffened in surprise. Weren't he and Miss Rivers together? Why was he protecting the suspect?

"We have both physical evidence and witness statements, Mr. Grayson. This is official police business—step aside."

Amelia inhaled sharply, tears welling in her wide eyes as she stared at Evelyn. The betrayal seemed to crush her delicate spirit.
###Chapter 289

"Evelyn, I genuinely wanted to be your friend." Amelia's voice trembled as she clutched the thermos tighter. "I even made this soup specially for you. So why... why would you want to harm me like this? What could I have possibly done to deserve such cruelty?"

"You've done nothing to me." Evelyn's lips curled into a knowing smirk, her gaze sharp as daggers. "You only returned two days ago. There's no way you could have crossed me in such a short time." She watched Amelia closely, wondering if the woman would catch her hidden meaning.

Amelia had arrived home just forty-eight hours prior. Meanwhile, Evelyn had been hospitalized since yesterday morning after suffering a severe allergic reaction. Nathaniel and Sophia Bennett had remained by her bedside the entire time, leaving no opportunity for Evelyn to orchestrate any scheme—even if she'd wanted to hurt Amelia.

Furthermore, no one had known about Amelia's return until yesterday. The entire accusation would only make sense if Evelyn possessed psychic abilities to foresee the future. More importantly, Evelyn hadn't even known Amelia existed until their paths crossed yesterday. They'd never interacted before—how could Evelyn possibly have motive?

To any rational observer, the timeline alone proved Evelyn's innocence. Only someone deliberately framing her would ignore these glaring inconsistencies.

The real question was: who actually wanted Amelia harmed? Evelyn already knew the answer.

'This soup delivery is just a pretense,' Evelyn thought coldly. 'Her true purpose is to provoke Nathaniel.'

Nathaniel stood rigidly nearby, his jaw clenched. He recognized Amelia's manipulative tactics but remained silent, knowing Evelyn would disapprove if he interfered.

Amelia lingered beside Nathaniel, studying his unfamiliar expression—a turbulent mix of longing and frustration. She waited with him as the police continued their questioning.

"Nathaniel..." Amelia hesitated before posing her carefully crafted question. "If—just hypothetically—if Evelyn really did arrange my attack... would you ever consider... divorcing her?"

Nathaniel's eyes turned glacial. His response came without hesitation. "Never."

Tears welled in Amelia's eyes instantly. "Why? She deserves punishment for something so vile—"
###Chapter 290

Nathaniel's jaw tightened as he watched the officers cuff Evelyn's delicate wrists. Every fiber of his being screamed to intervene, but he bit back his protests. She had agreed to this, and he would respect her decision—no matter how much it tore him apart.

The metallic click of the handcuffs echoed in the sterile hospital room.

Outside the door, an officer stood guard, effectively cutting off any chance of escape. Not that Evelyn looked like she wanted to run. She sat calmly, her posture relaxed despite the restraints.

They hadn't started questioning her yet. The doctor insisted she finish her IV treatment first. The officers, showing unexpected humanity, agreed to let her rest afterward.

Evelyn ate the breakfast Nathaniel had sent for her, then leaned back against the pillows, waiting. Her eyes drifted shut, her breathing steady. She was preparing herself.

By noon, the interrogation began.

Nathaniel bristled when they told him to leave. "I'm not going anywhere."

The officers exchanged uneasy glances.

Then Evelyn spoke, her voice soft but firm. "Nathaniel. Wait outside."

His fingers curled into fists, but he grabbed his jacket and stalked out, his gaze never leaving her through the small window in the door.

Amelia approached him from behind, her fingers brushing his arm. "Nathaniel..."

He barely glanced at her. "Why are you still here?"

Her lips trembled. "I just... I need to know why she would do this to me."

Nathaniel didn't answer. His attention was locked on Evelyn inside the room—her quiet nods, the way she answered without hesitation. This wasn't the defiant woman who challenged him at every turn.

Amelia shivered, rubbing her arms. "It's cold."

Nathaniel finally looked at her. "Go back to your room. You shouldn't be out here."

Her eyes flickered to the jacket in his hands, but he didn't offer it.

Instead, he turned back to the window, his expression unreadable.

Amelia hesitated, then whispered, "If... if she really did this, would you ever leave her?"

Nathaniel's voice was ice. "No."

Tears welled in Amelia's eyes. "But she—"

"I said no."

The finality in his tone silenced her.

Inside the room, Evelyn remained composed, answering every question with quiet certainty.

And Nathaniel watched, torn between fury and something far more dangerous—helpless devotion.
###Chapter 291

"She's innocent," Nathaniel cut in before Amelia could finish her ridiculous accusation.

Amelia's face fell. "Nathaniel, how can you be so sure? You've only known her for what—a month?"

"She's my wife. That's all the reason I need to trust her," Nathaniel replied absently, completely missing Amelia's implication as his gaze remained fixed on Evelyn's hospital room door.

'My wife.' Those two words made Amelia's smile falter for a split second before she forced a sweet expression. "You're right. There must be some misunderstanding. Evelyn would never do something like this."

Gabrielle and Benjamin stormed out of the elevator.

"Nathaniel! We came as soon as we heard!" Gabrielle spat angrily. "This time Evelyn's gone too far. How dare she hire someone to attack Amelia when she's done nothing wrong? Amelia just got back!"

"Watch your tone. The investigation isn't over," Nathaniel said coldly.

Gabrielle shivered under his glare and immediately shut her mouth. She'd assumed Nathaniel would discard Evelyn the moment Amelia returned. Clearly, she'd underestimated Evelyn's hold on him.

Benjamin, however, only had eyes for his sister. Though younger, he towered over Amelia. "Are you okay?" he asked urgently. "They didn't tell me until this morning—afraid I'd do something reckless."

Amelia patted his cheek affectionately. "I'm fine, Ben. Nathaniel arrived just in time."

Only when assured of her safety did Benjamin relax—then his fists clenched. "That bastard. If I ever get my hands on him—"

"Benjamin Rivers!" Amelia scolded playfully. "Let the police handle this. No fighting, or you'll make me worry."

Instantly chastened, Benjamin ducked his head like a scolded puppy. "Yes, Amelia. I'll behave."

The hospital door swung open then, officers emerging with frustrated expressions and a case file.

Gabrielle pounced immediately. "Well? Did Evelyn confess to hiring that thug?"

The lead investigator sighed. "No confession. She maintains her innocence."

"What?" Gabrielle's voice rose. "You have witness testimony and evidence! Show her the proof!"

"The 'witness' is the perpetrator himself. He provided chat logs showing a $15,000 transfer from Miss Whitmore's account," the officer explained wearily. "But she claims the logs are fabricated, her account hacked. She won't admit guilt unless we prove she met the assailant beforehand."

The interrogation had been a masterclass in evasion. Evelyn answered every question—then dismantled their case with razor-sharp logic, exposing every inconsistency until even the officers doubted their own evidence.

After three exhausting hours, they had no choice but to recommend dropping charges.
###Chapter 292

Gabrielle's blood boiled when she heard the officer's defeated tone. Having witnessed Evelyn's schemes firsthand, she exploded in rage. "That witch isn't just vile—she's a master manipulator!"

Her fury grew with each passing second.

"Gabrielle, don't be hasty. What if she's innocent?" Benjamin's calm voice cut through her anger.

Gabrielle gaped at him. "Are you hearing yourself, Benjamin?"

She might tremble before Nathaniel, but she'd never back down from Benjamin.

"That's Amelia we're talking about! How could you defend an outsider over your own sister?"

Benjamin's brow furrowed. "I'm not taking sides. I just don't believe Evelyn would do this. And let's not forget how many times you've wronged her."

Gabrielle's mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water. Her past actions had been ruthless, but she'd justified them as necessary for Amelia's happiness. Every scheme had failed spectacularly.

Giving up on reasoning with Benjamin, she turned to Amelia. "See how he betrays you? After all your love, he cares more about that woman!"

Amelia snapped from her thoughts with a gentle smile. "Nonsense. Benjamin has a pure heart—he sees good in everyone. I'm the same way."

Benjamin nodded gratefully.

Gabrielle nearly tore her hair out. Why weren't they panicking? Their naivety would be their downfall. She'd sooner die than let Evelyn escape justice. "Officer, do you have enough evidence or not?"

The officer shook his head. "Not yet. We'd need surveillance footage or photos of Evelyn meeting the perpetrator. But criminals rarely meet in public spaces with cameras. Such evidence is nearly impossible to obtain."

Gabrielle's frustration mounted. She wanted Evelyn behind bars immediately.

Nathaniel's icy voice cut through the tension. "Remove her handcuffs. Now."

The officer paled, beads of sweat forming on his brow. "Mister Nathaniel, I..."
###Chapter 293

Nathaniel wasn't someone the police could afford to cross. Meanwhile, Samuel made it clear they couldn't let Evelyn off easily. Caught between two powerful men, the officers hesitated, unsure how to proceed.

"Is there really not enough evidence?" Samuel's sharp voice cut through the tension as he stepped out of the elevator.

"Samuel!" Gabrielle's face brightened instantly at the sight of him.

He walked toward them with the effortless confidence only men like Nathaniel and him possessed.

Amelia's expression shifted slightly, relief flickering in her eyes, but she stayed rooted beside Nathaniel. She wasn't about to leave his side.

Benjamin, meanwhile, was torn between awe and panic. He considered bolting but knew that would only make things worse.

"Samuel, perfect timing! The officers said they need circumstantial evidence linking Evelyn to the perpetrator. But where would we even find that?"

Samuel smirked. "You're looking at it."

Gabrielle blinked. "You... have proof? You saw something?"

"I am the proof," Samuel stated coolly. "I happened to witness Evelyn meeting the suspect two nights ago."

He stepped forward, nodding politely at the officers before locking eyes with Nathaniel. "Nathaniel, apologies. I wouldn't interfere if this didn't involve my sister's safety."

His tone was diplomatic, but the challenge in his gaze was unmistakable.

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "So the great Samuel Rivers has time to play false witness now?"

Samuel's smile didn't waver. "Underestimating me, Nathaniel? I don't lie under oath. And I don't forgive those who harm my family—even if they're your wife."

The air between them crackled with hostility. Their families' long-standing feud simmered beneath the surface.

Amelia, sensing the impending explosion, quickly intervened. She wrapped her arms around Samuel. "Samuel, let's just drop this. Evelyn is Nathaniel's wife, and I—"

Samuel stroked her hair affectionately. "Amelia, weakness invites cruelty. If we don't end this now, there will be a next time. As your brother, I won't let anyone hurt you and walk away unscathed."

Though they were only half-siblings, Samuel adored Amelia. Having lost his younger sister years ago, he poured all his protectiveness into her.

Nathaniel watched him coldly. "So you're determined to lock up anyone under suspicion—including my innocent wife?"

"Only because it's your wife did I bother gathering proof," Samuel countered smoothly. "Interrogate her yourself. You'll see whether she's been framed... or if you never really knew her at all."

His confidence was unshakable. Turning to the officers, he asked, "As a witness, I have the right to confront the suspect, correct?"

The officer, momentarily dazed, snapped to attention. "Y-Yes. Of course."
###Chapter 294

Nathaniel Grayson inclined his head with practiced elegance. "In that case, officers, would you be so kind as to arrange my confrontation with the suspect Evelyn Whitmore?"

The officers exchanged glances before escorting Nathaniel into Evelyn's hospital room. Samuel Rivers moved to follow, but the officer stationed at the door raised a stern hand to block his path.

"Apologies, Mr. Grayson. This remains an active investigation. Unrelated parties must remain outside."

Samuel's eyebrow arched. "Then why is he permitted entry?"

The officer gestured toward Nathaniel. "Mr. Rivers here is providing witness testimony. He has legal standing to confront the accused."

"And what makes you believe I'm unrelated?" Samuel's voice dropped dangerously low.

The officer blinked. "Sir... how are you involved?"

"I filed the initial police report." Samuel's calm tone carried undeniable authority. "That grants me the right to observe proceedings."

Truth be told, it had been Lucas Sinclair who'd contacted authorities upon discovering the crime scene. But Samuel had instructed the call be made in his name - a strategic move now paying dividends.

The officer hesitated, then lowered his arm in silent acquiescence.

Amelia Rivers saw her chance and stepped forward. "Officer, as the victim, I deserve to be present! Besides..." Her voice trembled as she touched her bandaged forehead. "I need my brother with me. I don't feel safe alone."

The officer wavered. Amelia's delicate beauty and visible injuries made resistance difficult. With a sigh, he permitted her entry.

Gabrielle Winslow and Benjamin Rivers immediately attempted to follow.

"Not you two," the officer snapped.

Benjamin scowled. "That's my sister and brother in there!"

The officer eyed Benjamin's designer clothes with open suspicion. "Identify yourself properly. Who exactly are these siblings of yours?"

Gabrielle smoothly interceded, pulling Benjamin aside before he could escalate the situation. She offered the officer a disarming smile. "Forgive my friend's manners. We're Amelia's family. After her car accident and now this attack... she's quite fragile. She forgot her medication, and we fear her injuries may cause complications. We'll be quick - just long enough to ensure she takes her pills."

The officer recalled Amelia's pallid complexion and reluctantly stepped aside.
###Chapter 295

"Ugh, this crowd is giving me a headache!" The officer guarding the door rubbed his temples. "Everyone's got some excuse to get inside. Should've never let the first group through."

He knew he'd have trouble explaining why some were allowed in while others weren't. With an exasperated sigh, he finally relented. "Alright, you two can enter. But keep quiet - no disturbing my team."

Gabrielle flashed a grateful smile and tugged Benjamin inside.

The officer wiped his brow. 'Thank God formal interrogations are done. This is just informal follow-up, so no harm letting them through.'

Since Samuel was Amelia's brother, his reliability as a witness remained questionable. The supervising officer hoped this confrontation with Evelyn might yield useful information. If Samuel proved helpful, they'd bring him to the station for official testimony.

Evelyn was struggling with the water glass when the group entered. The earlier questioning had left her parched, but her bandaged, swollen hands couldn't grip the slippery surface properly.

The gauze wrapping provided no traction, causing the glass to slip each time she lifted it. Her frustration grew until a familiar masculine hand suddenly took the glass and held it to her lips.

She looked up into Nathaniel's intense gaze. A straw protruded from the glass, requiring only that she part her lips. But pride made her refuse his assistance.

With stubborn determination, she reclaimed the glass, positioning one hand beneath and another alongside it. Only then did she drink, the cool water soothing her dry throat.

"Thank you," she murmured politely.

Nathaniel's brow furrowed at her formality but said nothing. Instead, he gently patted her head twice - the comforting gesture parents use with children.

Evelyn glanced up in surprise mid-sip, then offered him a small, knowing smile.

Nathaniel returned it silently. Their unspoken understanding needed no words, their subtle interaction speaking volumes.

Nearby, Amelia stood beside Samuel. Her eyes dimmed watching their exchange before she turned abruptly into her brother's embrace.

Samuel's arms encircled Amelia protectively, his hand patting her back. Then his gaze turned murderous toward Nathaniel and Evelyn.

To Samuel, Amelia was perfection incarnate - save for her unfortunate obsession with Nathaniel. Every tear she shed traced back to that man.

'That worthless bastard! Flirting with another woman right in front of her? He might as well stab her through the heart!'

Determined to spare Amelia further pain, Samuel's voice cut through the room like ice. "Miss Whitmore, what an unexpected pleasure."
###Chapter 296

Evelyn's gaze locked onto Samuel. "Seems like that 7.5 million dollar check didn't buy much silence. Didn't you swear you'd stay away for a year after getting paid? Not even twenty-four hours have passed."

Samuel had grown accustomed to Evelyn's unpredictable nature. A smirk played on his lips as he replied smoothly, "Miss Whitmore, this isn't the time for jokes. I wouldn't be here if the victim wasn't my own sister."

Evelyn took a slow sip through her straw. "I've already told the police everything about that case. Feel free to ask them for details."

His eyes turned icy. "I'm here with police authorization for a direct confrontation."

"Confrontation?" Evelyn arched an eyebrow.

Nathaniel stood sentinel beside Evelyn's hospital bed when one officer addressed him. "Mr. Grayson, please step aside. We need to document this witness-suspect confrontation."

Nathaniel remained motionless, hands tucked in his pockets like an unshakable mountain.

The officer swallowed hard under that silent pressure. "Mr. Grayson—"

Evelyn heard the strain in his voice. She turned to Nathaniel. "I'm done with this water. Would you mind putting it away? And maybe take a seat? You must be tired standing so long."

Her cuffed hands fumbled with the cup as she extended it toward him, making Nathaniel narrow his eyes.

He took the cup effortlessly but made no move to discard it. Instead, he carried it to a chair positioned slightly away from the bed. Crossing his long legs, he rested an elbow on the armrest, chin propped on his hand. Then, to everyone's shock, he brought the straw to his lips and took a sip while watching Evelyn intently.

Every non-police witness stared in disbelief. Everyone knew Nathaniel's germaphobia—his notorious aversion to sharing anything that touched another's mouth. Yet here he was, drinking from the same straw with apparent ease.

Amelia's face darkened as she witnessed this. Her hands clenched into fists unconsciously.

Noticing her distress, Samuel took Amelia's hand and guided her to the sofa. He pulled her close, protectively patting her shoulder. 'I'll keep her safe,' his actions promised.

The officers finished setting up recording equipment—both video and written documentation.

Samuel cut straight to the chase. "Miss Whitmore, you demanded circumstantial evidence linking you to the perpetrator. Well, you're looking at it now."

Evelyn covered a yawn. "I believe I asked for real evidence, not fabricated nonsense."

His expression didn't flicker. "Rest assured, I wouldn't be here without irrefutable proof."

Leaning back against her pillows, Evelyn smiled lazily. "Do enlighten me, Mr. Rivers. How exactly do you plan to prove I've met this so-called perpetrator?"
###Chapter 297

Nathaniel sat upright, fingers interlaced and resting on his crossed knee. The gesture signaled his shift into serious mode. "Before answering that, may I ask you a few questions, Miss Evelyn?" His tone was deliberately measured.

"Go ahead."

"Two nights ago, were you by the Yonde River embankment?"

"I was." Evelyn nodded.

"And your reason for being there? Perhaps needing fresh air to clear your mind?"

"What does my mood have to do with this case?" Her brows knitted together.

A shadow flickered across Samuel's eyes. "Trust me, it's relevant. Please answer truthfully without evasion."

Evelyn struggled to articulate the tangled emotions from that night. The memory felt like grasping at smoke.

"I needed distraction. The river seemed peaceful."

Samuel's lips curved knowingly. "Amelia returned from abroad that evening. Your husband Nathaniel arranged an entire garden of flowers at Silver Moon Estate to welcome her. While that gesture between old friends might seem innocent, you happened to witness it, didn't you?"

Nathaniel's grip tightened around his glass, his gaze laser-focused on Evelyn's reaction.

The image flashed before her - pink tulips carpeting the estate grounds, Amelia emerging from an oversized gift box to throw herself into Nathaniel's arms. Unbidden, her expression darkened.

"Speechless, Miss Evelyn? Or unwilling to admit you saw your husband's romantic display for another woman?" Samuel's velvet voice carried steel beneath.

Evelyn felt twin pairs of eyes dissecting her - Samuel's clinical observation and Nathaniel's burning intensity. She drew a steadying breath.

"Correct. I saw everything you described. What of it?"

Samuel's congenial mask slipped as he stood abruptly. "From that moment, Amelia became your enemy. Consumed by jealousy, you hired someone to attack her. The riverbank meeting? You paid fifteen thousand dors to your accomplice. Later, you provided Amelia's hospital details so he could finish the job. Am I painting an accurate picture?"

Evelyn's lips parted in shock. "That's absurd! I've neither the means nor motive for such cruelty. I've never even met Daniel Carter! Without concrete evidence, this isn't an interrogation - it's coercion!"

"Patience, Miss Evelyn. We're just beginning." Samuel signaled his assistant, who handed him a smartphone.

"Recall the influencer who illegally parked on the embankment's tactile paving? Her livestream accidentally captured your meeting with the perpetrator. The proof lies here - shall we watch your lies unravel together?"
###Chapter 298

Evelyn remained completely unfazed by Lucas's accusations. Why should she panic when she knew she'd done nothing wrong? A camera couldn't possibly capture events that never occurred.

"Fine," she said coolly. "Show us this video then."

Lucas gave a sharp nod to his secretary Edmund, who promptly connected a phone to the conference room's large screen. The footage began playing for all to see.

The video showed a popular female influencer perched precariously on the riverbank railing, her selfie stick extended high as she livestreamed. The camera angle accidentally captured the street behind her, where Evelyn sat alone on a bench in the corner of the frame.

There she was - drinking a soda, gazing at the clouds, her expression unreadable from the distance but undeniably solitary. Evelyn cringed internally at how melancholy she appeared.

"As you can clearly see," she pointed out, "I was by myself."

Lucas's gaze remained steady. "So you confirm that's you in the video?"

"Obviously. Now where's this mysterious accomplice you keep insisting was with me?" Evelyn countered smoothly.

"Patience, Miss Whitmore," Lucas murmured. He fast-forwarded the footage before pausing at a specific timestamp. When playback resumed, a young man carrying flyers approached and sat beside Evelyn.

The bespectacled youth stood about five-seven, slightly heavyset, wearing a checkered shirt. After a moment, he handed Evelyn a promotional leaflet, enthusiastically describing a new barbecue joint's opening specials and membership benefits.

Evelyn had only half-listened at the time, absently accepting the flyer. When the young man offered a free premium steak for signing up - and mentioned his commission - her softer side had emerged. She'd scanned his QR code, thinking she might treat Lily and William to dinner there later.

Never had she imagined this mundane interaction would be caught on some random livestream. Worse still, the influencer's loud sponsorship pitches drowned out their conversation, making the QR code scan look suspicious without context.

Evelyn's stomach dropped as she realized how damning this looked. The video provided just enough visual evidence to fuel speculation, while the missing audio created perfect conditions for misinterpretation.

Lucas's expression turned triumphant. "Now do you understand why we have questions?"

The screen froze on the moment Evelyn's phone connected to the young man's device - an image that, taken out of context, appeared far more incriminating than the harmless reality.
###Chapter 299

"That's him!" The officer's voice cut through the tense silence. "The man sitting with Miss Evelyn is Daniel Carter—the same man we arrested for attempted assault."

The officer turned sharply toward Evelyn, his gaze unyielding. "Miss Whitmore, care to explain?"

Evelyn's face remained impassive, though the faintest twitch at the corner of her lips betrayed her irritation. Clever. They’ve really gone all out to frame me. First, Nathaniel’s calculated questioning—masked as casual conversation—had laid the groundwork for motive. Now, this damning video.

Amelia, trembling violently, collapsed into Nathaniel’s arms the moment she recognized her attacker on screen. "Nathaniel, that’s him! He—he tore my clothes—he tried to—"

A dangerous glint flashed in Nathaniel’s eyes at the thought of Amelia—his most precious person—being violated. He pulled her closer, his voice low and soothing. "Shh. I’m here. No one will ever touch you again."

But Amelia wasn’t just afraid of her assailant. She couldn’t fathom why Evelyn would orchestrate such cruelty. "Nathaniel… why would Evelyn do this? I only ever wanted to be her friend…"

Nathaniel stroked her hair gently. "Sweetheart, haven’t you heard the fable about the wolf in sheep’s clothing? Not everyone deserves your kindness."

To the world, Nathaniel was the epitome of grace—polished, composed, effortlessly charming. But beneath that veneer lay a man of ice, his smiles never reaching his eyes. Amelia was the sole exception. The warmth in his gaze now was real, his worry palpable as he murmured, "Don’t cry. As long as I’m here, no one will harm you."

"Nathaniel…" Amelia’s sobs gradually subsided under his quiet reassurances.

Benjamin, who had been silent until now, finally snapped. He knew better than to interrupt when Nathaniel was handling things, but the evidence against Evelyn was too blatant to ignore.

Disgust and fury burned in his eyes as he stormed toward Evelyn. "How could you? I defended you! I thought you were different! Why would you hurt Amelia? You’re a woman—how could you do this to another woman?"

Evelyn met his rage with cool detachment. Arguing now would be pointless.

Gabrielle tugged Benjamin back with a sigh. "I warned you, Benjamin. Evelyn’s always been a master at deception. At least now you see the truth."

Then, her gaze slid to Nathaniel, who still sat motionless, his expression unreadable. Internally, she was smug—vindicated. Outwardly, she shook her head in feigned disappointment. "You too, Nathaniel. You fell for her innocent act. Thank goodness this case exposed her. Who knows how long she would’ve fooled everyone?"

Amelia wiped her tears and approached Nathaniel, her voice trembling. "Nathaniel… please don’t be angry. Maybe Evelyn didn’t mean for things to go this far…"
###Chapter 300

Nathaniel continued sipping his drink calmly, his expression unreadable.

Amelia tugged at his sleeve, leaning closer. "Nathaniel? Are you listening?"

Silence. He didn't even glance her way. No one could decipher what was going through his mind.

Seeing her being ignored, Samuel stepped forward protectively and wrapped an arm around Amelia's shoulders. He shot Nathaniel a disapproving look before turning to Evelyn.

"Miss Whitmore, I don't believe you're entirely heartless. After all, you helped my grandfather when he collapsed last week. Not many would stop for a stranger like that." His voice hardened. "But when it comes to protecting your position, you'll resort to hurting innocent people, won't you?"

Evelyn frowned. "Protecting my position? What exactly are you implying?"

Samuel's eyes narrowed. "You had Amelia attacked because you're threatened by her relationship with Nathaniel."

For a moment, Evelyn looked stunned. Then she laughed. "If she wants to be Mrs. Grayson so badly, she can have the title."

Nathaniel's grip tightened around his glass.

Samuel scoffed. "That doesn't change the fact that you're still the prime suspect."

Evelyn lounged back against her pillows, the handcuffs glinting on her wrists. "I'm not trying to clear my name. Honestly, being his wife is more trouble than it's worth. Your sister can have him."

Nathaniel's jaw clenched at her words. The room tensed - who in their right mind would reject being Nathaniel Grayson's wife? Especially someone like Evelyn, who came from nothing.

Samuel shook his head. "You have one last chance to confess. Admit you hired that man to attack Amelia, and I'll personally request leniency from the judge."

Evelyn yawned dramatically. "How generous. But no thanks."

"Fine." Samuel's smile turned cold. "Enjoy your prison sentence then."

An officer closed his notebook and stood. "Mr. Rivers, we'll need you to come to the station to verify how you obtained the phone evidence."

"Of course," Samuel nodded.

The officer secured Evelyn's ankle to the bed rail with another set of cuffs. "Miss Whitmore, with witness testimony, physical evidence, and motive established, you'll be formally arrested once medically cleared."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Whatever."

The officer opened his mouth to reprimand her when a chair scraped loudly behind him.

Nathaniel stood, his towering frame casting a shadow across the room. The air grew heavy with his barely contained fury as he strode toward Evelyn. Everyone instinctively stepped back.
###Chapter 301

The officer swallowed hard under the weight of Nathaniel's icy stare. His fingers twitched nervously as he scrambled for an explanation—why Evelyn Whitmore was cuffed to the hospital bed. He had heard enough earlier to know she was Nathaniel Grayson's wife.

Nathaniel didn't speak. He simply walked past the officer, picked up the discarded cup from the bedside table, and set it back down. The straw was crushed, teeth marks pressed deep into the plastic.

Then he turned to Evelyn. His gaze was unreadable, dark and heavy with something she couldn't decipher.

Evelyn's usual indifference faltered under his silence. She clenched her jaw, meeting his eyes briefly before looking away. "I didn't do it," she muttered.

"Okay." His voice was calm, devoid of doubt.

Her head snapped up. Okay? That was it? No questions, no accusations—just okay?

But Nathaniel didn't elaborate. He never did.

Frustrated, Evelyn turned to the officer. "I want to see my lawyer. Now."

The officer nodded stiffly. "You're entitled to that."

"Then hand me the phone."

Nathaniel reached for the device before she could, placing it in her lap. Without another word, he turned and walked out.

Amelia Rivers, still held back by her brother Samuel, strained against his grip. "Nathaniel—!"

Samuel shot Evelyn one last sharp look before dragging his sister away.

The officers, satisfied their suspect was secured, followed.

The room emptied quickly. Only Benjamin Rivers remained, his handsome face twisted with fury.

Evelyn arched a brow. "What? Going to hit me now?"

"I can't believe you," Benjamin spat. "After everything—this?"

She smirked. "Guess you'll just have to live with the disappointment."

His fists clenched. "You—"

"Don't waste your breath, Benjamin." Gabrielle Winslow stepped forward, her lips curled in triumph as she glared at Evelyn. "The police will handle her."

With that, she pulled Benjamin away, leaving Evelyn alone.

The moment the door clicked shut, Evelyn snatched up the phone and dialed Sebastian Monroe's encrypted line. "Get Julian Montgomery from legal to the hospital. Now."

Sebastian's voice sharpened. "Boss? What happened?"

"Nothing major. Just send him. Alone."

"Understood."

The call ended. Evelyn exhaled, staring at the ceiling.

This wasn't over. Not even close.
###Chapter 302

The hospital corridor stretched empty before Amelia as she stepped out of the ward. Her eyes darted from side to side, searching for any sign of Nathaniel.

Only minutes had passed since he'd left, yet he'd vanished completely. "Where did he go?" she murmured to herself.

The stairwell door at the end of the hall swung open abruptly. Samuel entered with a grim expression that made Amelia's pulse quicken.

She rushed forward to intercept him. "Samuel!"

He gave her a curt nod. "Amelia."

"Is Nathaniel in there?" She gestured toward the stairwell.

Samuel didn't bother lying. "Yes."

Without waiting for further permission, Amelia pushed past him and through the heavy door. Samuel didn't stop her, though his gaze lingered on her retreating form with uncharacteristic hesitation. Shaking his head, he turned to complete the tasks Nathaniel had assigned.

The acrid scent of tobacco hit Amelia immediately. Through the haze, she spotted Nathaniel by the window, cigarette in hand.

"Cough! Nathaniel—" The smoke burned her throat.

Nathaniel exhaled slowly, the smoke curling around his sharp features. His piercing gaze locked onto hers as she approached.

Amelia's pale cheeks flushed pink. She reached out, fingers brushing the sleeve of his jacket. "Will you walk me out? I'd like you to see me off."

Silence stretched between them before Nathaniel crushed his cigarette against the windowsill. "Let's go."

A shy smile played on Amelia's lips as she followed him out. Spotting Samuel waiting by the door, she chirped, "We're going home now, Samuel!"

Samuel's eyes narrowed. "I told you to leave hours ago, but it takes him saying it for you to listen?" His tone held barely concealed irritation.

Amelia's blush deepened. She cast a furtive glance at Nathaniel before stamping her foot. "Samuel!"

"Fine." Samuel ruffled her hair with forced cheer before leveling a cold stare at Nathaniel. "Thanks for convincing her to leave. I know that couldn't have been easy for you."

Nathaniel's expression remained impassive. "No trouble."
###Chapter 303

The trio descended to the hospital lobby, with Evelyn drawing envious glances as she walked flanked by two strikingly handsome men.

To reach the elevators, they had to pass by the guarded entrance of Evelyn's ward. Police officers still stood sentry outside.

A sharply dressed man with a briefcase was explaining his purpose to the officer on duty.

Samuel recognized him instantly, his eyes narrowing. "Isn't that Julian Montgomery?"

Julian was a legal titan—founder of the city's top law firm and head of Newmoon Group's legal department. He only handled high-profile corporate cases, making his presence at a simple assault investigation baffling.

Evelyn's breath hitched when she recognized the attorney. She turned to Nathaniel, her expression wounded. "You still trust her? Enough to hire Julian Montgomery as her defense?"

Nathaniel's gaze darkened. "I didn't hire him."

"You didn't?" Amelia blinked in shock. "Then how did Evelyn manage to secure him?"

Few could afford Julian's services, let alone for something as trivial as this.

Samuel shot Nathaniel a skeptical look. He refused to believe a small-town girl like Evelyn had the connections to summon Julian.

After finishing his discussion with the officers, Julian spotted Nathaniel and Samuel approaching. He paused, offering a polite nod. "Mr. Grayson, Mr. Rivers. A pleasure."

Nathaniel acknowledged him with a curt nod, while Samuel mirrored the gesture.

"Forgive the interruption," Julian said smoothly, "but I have business here. Excuse me." With that, he entered Evelyn's ward.

The brief exchange confirmed Samuel's suspicions—Nathaniel wasn't behind this. If he were, Julian would've at least exchanged pleasantlies with his client. Instead, he'd maintained professional distance.

Which left one unsettling question: how did Evelyn pull this off?

The trio lingered, united by unspoken curiosity.

Ten minutes later, Julian emerged. He addressed the officers with practiced ease. "My client has granted me full authority over her case. I'd like to visit the station to interview the assailant. Could someone escort me?"

Before the officer could respond, Samuel stepped forward. "I'm heading there to give my statement. I can take you."

Julian's smile remained polite but firm. "I appreciate the offer, Mr. Rivers, but as Ms. Whitmore's counsel, it would be improper to fraternize with the victim's family. Professional boundaries, you understand."

"Of course," Samuel conceded, though his curiosity burned. The Riveras had once tried—and failed—to retain Julian for a major case.

Amelia watched the exchange, her gaze darting between her brother and Evelyn's door. Her fingers tightened around Nathaniel's arm. A girl like Evelyn shouldn't have these connections. Unless...

She studied Nathaniel's profile, but his expression gave nothing away. The only tell was the slight tension in his jaw—a sign something had unsettled him.

And that unsettled her.
###Chapter 304

Evelyn Whitmore rested against the headboard, eyes shut, when a sharp knock interrupted the silence.

The door creaked open, revealing an unfamiliar woman in her forties.

"Who are you looking for?" Evelyn's eyes snapped open, instantly alert. Why would the police allow a stranger in?

The woman bowed slightly. "Miss Evelyn, I'm Eleanor. Mister Lucas Sinclair sent me to assist you. Please let me know if you need anything."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Lucas? Lucas Sinclair?"

Eleanor nodded. "Yes, ma'am."

A frown tugged at Evelyn's lips. Why would he send a nurse now? Did Nathaniel leave? The thought stung more than she cared to admit. Not that I should be surprised. We were never anything real, no matter what sweet words he whispered.

A commotion erupted outside before she could dwell on it.

"Let me through! That's my aunt in there!" Sophia Bennett's voice rang out, sharp with frustration.

Evelyn sighed. "Eleanor, tell them to let her in. She's family."

Eleanor obliged, returning moments later with Sophia in tow. The girl clutched a thermos, her expression stormy.

"This is ridiculous! One day away, and everything falls apart!" Sophia huffed, setting the thermos down with a thud.

Evelyn eyed it. "What’s in there?"

"Chicken soup. Mom made it special." Sophia lifted the lid, steam curling into the air. "They say it heals everything."

A faint smile touched Evelyn's lips. "Perfect timing. I could use some."

Eleanor stepped forward, taking the thermos to pour a bowl.

Sophia's gaze flicked to the handcuffs securing Evelyn's wrists and ankles. Her jaw tightened. "You're just letting them do this?"

Evelyn shrugged. "Standard procedure for suspects."

"Suspect? Please!" Sophia scoffed. "You'd never hurt anyone. This is so unfair!"

The raw conviction in Sophia's voice caught Evelyn off guard. She barely knows me, yet she believes me without question. Meanwhile, Nathaniel...

She shoved the thought aside. No use dwelling on him now.

But Sophia wasn't done. "And Uncle Nathaniel—" She cut herself off, biting her lip.

Evelyn's curiosity flared. "What about him?"

Sophia hesitated, then shook her head. "Never mind."

The evasion only sharpened Evelyn's interest. "Tell me."

Sophia exhaled sharply. "Fine. He’s being impossible. Even now, he’s—"

The door swung open again, cutting her off.

Evelyn leaned forward. "He’s what?"

But Sophia just pressed her lips together, worry flashing in her eyes.

The silence stretched, heavy with unspoken words.
###Chapter 305

Sophia Bennett pulled up a chair and sat down, blinking nervously. "Nothing! I honestly don't know much! It's just... you can't eat properly, so maybe I should feed you?"

Evelyn Whitmore frowned slightly. "So you're not going to tell me?"

Sophia idolized Evelyn and couldn't bear the thought of disappointing her. After a brief hesitation, she caved.

"Fine. When I got here, I saw him walking Amelia out of the hospital. Then... she got into his car."

Evelyn's expression darkened. She stayed silent, her lips twisting into something bitter.

Sophia panicked. "Don't be mad! Please don't divorce him over this! Give him another chance—"

Evelyn snapped out of her thoughts and met Sophia's worried gaze. "I'm not angry. But if there's no love between us, why stay married?"

Sophia's lips pressed into a stubborn line. "If you leave him, I won't get to see you anymore! I don’t want her as my aunt! You're the only one I accept!"

Evelyn studied the girl’s defiant expression. "Your uncle is wealthy, powerful, and handsome. He could easily find someone better than me. You’ll learn to like her eventually."

"No!" Sophia shook her head fiercely. "No one is better than you!"

Evelyn sighed. "But Amelia—"

"Don’t say her name!" Sophia cut in, disgust twisting her features. "The last thing I want is her with Uncle Nathaniel!"

Evelyn tilted her head. "You really hate her. Why?"

Sophia scowled. "She acts so fragile, like she’s always the victim. She saved him once as a kid and has been holding it over him ever since. He hates it!"

Evelyn raised a brow. "They don’t get along?"

Sophia hesitated. "I... I don’t know for sure. But he treats her differently. That’s why people think they’re close."

Evelyn nodded slowly. "You’re right. He does treat her differently. It’s obvious."

She remembered how Nathaniel had rushed to Amelia’s side, his voice softening like she might shatter. That kind of patience—he never showed it to anyone else.

Sophia’s eyes widened with worry. "But he treats you even more differently! You’re the only one he actually tolerates!"

Tolerates? Evelyn almost laughed. Because he needs me to deal with his family. If I read too much into it, that’s my own fault.

After finishing her soup, Evelyn gently urged Sophia to go home—there wasn’t enough space for her to stay with Eleanor. Nathaniel never returned after escorting Amelia out.

By afternoon, the nurse removed Evelyn’s IV. The swelling had gone down, but faint redness remained. The doctor assured her she’d be fine with antihistamines.

Then the police walked in.

"According to your doctor, you’re cleared for discharge," one officer said, holding up a warrant. "You’re officially under arrest."
###Chapter 306

The interrogation room at the police station was dimly lit and claustrophobic. Two stone-faced officers sat across from Evelyn Whitmore, their expressions unyielding.

"Are you going to confess or not?" one of them demanded sharply.

Evelyn sat composed behind the small table, her voice steady. "Confess to what? I haven't done anything wrong."

The officer scowled at her defiance. "You'd get a lighter sentence if you cooperated. I've dealt with stubborn criminals like you before—they all regret it when the verdict comes down. A young woman like you should know better than to break the law and hurt others. Your family would be ashamed!"

Evelyn arched a brow. "Ever heard the phrase 'give a dog a bad name and hang him'? In all my years, I've never met officers as reckless as you. Did you even graduate from the academy? If your superiors saw how carelessly you handle cases, they'd dock your pay."

The officer's face flushed red. "Y-You—!"

His partner cleared his throat. "This is an interrogation room, Miss Whitmore. Show some respect."

Evelyn shrugged. "Fine. Then I'll exercise my right to remain silent. Talk to my lawyer when he arrives."

The second officer sighed in frustration. "Unbelievable."

Just then, a sharp knock interrupted them. Another officer stepped in, whispering something urgent to the interrogators. Their expressions darkened.

"New witnesses? Now?" one muttered.

"Since when did a straightforward case get so complicated?"

"Nathaniel Grayson and his sister are waiting for results. We were supposed to wrap this up today!"

"Just take her to the visiting room for now."

One officer turned to Evelyn. "Your lawyer's here. Let's go."

He unlocked the cuffs binding her to the table.

Evelyn rose calmly, following them to a larger room where visitors could meet detainees. Inside, her lawyer, Julian Montgomery, stood waiting—along with Nathaniel, Benjamin, Amelia, and Gabrielle. All of them watched her intently.

Her gaze swept the room, lingering for half a second before she caught herself.

Who am I kidding? He doesn’t care anymore. Not that I need him to.

Nathaniel lounged in a chair, his posture relaxed but his eyes icy as they tracked Evelyn’s cuffed hands. Then he turned to Julian with a mocking smile.

"Mr. Montgomery, you’re one of the most respected lawyers in the city. Yet here you are, defending a criminal who hired someone to commit assault. Aren’t you worried about tarnishing your reputation?"
###Chapter 307

Julian Montgomery responded with professional gravity. "I'm an attorney, Mr. Sinclair. My sole purpose here is to secure justice for my client and clear her name. No innocent person should suffer for crimes they didn't commit."

Samuel Rivers smirked. "Interesting theory. But with such overwhelming evidence, I'd love to hear how you plan to prove her innocence."

Evelyn Whitmore sat quietly as instructed by the officers. Moments later, a uniformed policeman escorted in the assailant who'd attacked Amelia. The moment Amelia spotted Daniel Carter, she shrank against her brother's chest. Samuel could only hold her tighter as murderous rage flashed across his features.

Julian began his questioning. "We met yesterday, so let's skip introductions. Would you please recount your confession for the record?"

Daniel had already pleaded guilty. He nodded obediently. "Three nights ago, Evelyn contacted me near Silver Peaks River. She transferred fifteen thousand as deposit, ordering me to assault a woman named Amelia Rivers. The remaining fifteen would come after completion."

"The idea of money and... other benefits clouded my judgment. I agreed. Later, she messaged me Amelia's hospital room details. That's where the police caught me."

Julian pounced immediately. "You're claiming my client Evelyn Whitmore commissioned this crime?"

"Absolutely!" Daniel confirmed.

"How did you two initially meet?"

"It was... random. She found my contact online."

Julian's voice turned razor-sharp. "Records show you were laid off two months ago. Too ashamed to tell your family, you've been doing odd jobs - including distributing flyers for a new barbecue joint three days ago. That's when you first met my client by Silver Peaks River, correct?"

Daniel's eyes darted sideways. "That was just... cover. She told me to pose as a flyer distributor to avoid suspicion."

"Fascinating." Julian's tone dripped sarcasm. "You maintained this charade for two months? Are you suggesting my client plotted against Miss Rivers two months in advance? That's remarkably thorough for someone who hadn't even met Nathaniel Grayson then."

Daniel scrambled. "Evelyn kept saying we needed patience! She was jealous of Amelia's history with Nathaniel. Wanted everything planned perfectly for when Amelia returned."

Julian's voice boomed. "Lies! My client didn't know Nathaniel Grayson two months ago! Why would she target a complete stranger? Your story makes zero sense!"

Daniel started sweating. "I... I don't remember details! But Evelyn transferred the money! Check my phone records!"

Julian countered smoothly. "My client's phone went missing that day. It was later recovered by police, then collected by Nathaniel's secretary. Anyone could've accessed it during that window to make that transfer."

Samuel interrupted impatiently. "Enough with the speculation, Mr. Montgomery. Unless you produce this mystery witness you promised, we're done here."

Julian checked his watch discreetly, concern flickering across his face as he glanced at Evelyn. The witness should have arrived by now.

"Please excuse me while I make a call."
###Chapter 308

Nathaniel stepped out to contact the witnesses.

Gabrielle rose from her seat, arms crossed defiantly as she approached Evelyn. "Don't think hiring some hotshot lawyer will clear your name!" she hissed with faux sweetness. "How dare you arrange that attack on Amelia? Samuel will make sure you pay for this! My advice? Stop fighting and take your punishment like a good girl. Maybe they'll go easier on you if you cooperate."

Evelyn barely glanced up, utterly bored by Gabrielle's pathetic attempts at provocation.

The dismissal infuriated Gabrielle. No matter what she said or did, Evelyn remained unshakable - that infuriating calm making Gabrielle itch to slap her just to see if she'd finally react.

Nearby, Benjamin watched Evelyn with smoldering eyes full of conflicting emotions - disappointment, anger, and something more complicated.

Amelia turned her head weakly from Samuel's embrace. "Gabrielle's right, Evelyn," she said with practiced concern. "If you confess, I'll convince Samuel to request leniency. Making a scene will only make things worse for you."

Evelyn's lips curled. "Why are you and your little friend so desperate to stop me from 'making a scene'?"

Amelia's eyes flickered. "I'm just trying to help you, Evelyn. I don't want you to-"

"Save it," Evelyn interrupted, closing her eyes dismissively.

Samuel's protective instincts flared at his sister's distress. "After what you did for our grandfather, I was willing to show mercy," he said coldly. "But keep pushing, and you'll regret it."

Evelyn yawned dramatically. "How generous. Unfortunately, I don't do regrets. Bring it on."

Samuel studied her fearless expression with frustration. 'What kind of upbringing creates a woman this brazen instead of proper and refined?'

"Don't waste your breath on her, Samuel!" Gabrielle snapped. "She's just some backwater hick who doesn't understand consequences. Let her cry when the judge slams her with maximum sentencing!"

The door burst open before Gabrielle could continue. A young boy rushed toward the handcuffed Daniel Carter.

"Dad!" The child tried to hug his father but froze when he saw the restraints. "Why are you in handcuffs? Only bad guys get handcuffed on TV! Did you do something bad?"

Daniel's tough facade shattered at the sight of his son. He hung his head in shame. "I... I didn't mean to, son..."
###Chapter 309

The child's faith in his father shattered instantly. He stumbled backward, eyes brimming with betrayal. "Why did you do bad things, Dad? You always told me to be good! How could you? You're not my dad anymore! I hate you!"

"Oliver! Don't speak to your father like that!" A woman in a simple dress rushed in, scolding her son before turning tear-filled eyes to her husband. "Daniel, tell them the truth. Do you want our boy to grow up believing his father is a criminal?"

Daniel Carter exhaled sharply at the sight of his unharmed family. Shame burned through him as he dropped his gaze. "I'm just glad you're both safe. That's... that's all that matters."

Eleanor pressed against him, voice breaking. "We're okay now, Daniel. We were rescued! Why didn't you tell me you'd lost your job? All those odd jobs you took... and then they manipulated you into this! Confess everything to the police. They might show leniency!"

A sob tore from Daniel's throat when she didn't recoil from his touch. He scrubbed his face roughly before meeting the officers' stares. "I'll talk. I lied before because they had my family. Someone kidnapped them—forced me to take the blame!"

The station erupted in murmurs. One officer stepped forward, skeptical. "You're retracting your confession? Lying now will only make things worse."

Daniel's jaw set. "I'm done lying. Evelyn Whitmore didn't hire me. Someone else threatened me into attacking Miss Amelia."

Nathaniel Grayson's gaze sharpened. Across the room, Benjamin Rivers leaned forward, hungry for answers.

Amelia kept her face buried against her brother Samuel's shoulder but peeked at Daniel through her fingers. The sudden shift in his story left her stunned.

Gabrielle Winslow's nails dug into her palms. She'd been savoring Evelyn's impending ruin, only for that cunning woman to wriggle free yet again.

Julian Montgomery entered calmly. "Mr. Grayson, as I mentioned earlier, these are my new witnesses—Daniel's wife and son. They were held captive in an abandoned suburban building for days. His confession was coerced."

Nathaniel's icy stare locked onto Daniel. "Names. Now."

Julian placed a hand on Daniel's shoulder. "Your family's safe. It's time to expose who really orchestrated this."
###Chapter 310

Daniel Carter hesitated before revealing his manipulator. With a deep bow, he faced Evelyn Whitmore with guilt-ridden eyes.

"I'm truly sorry, Miss Evelyn. I was forced into this situation. They made me frame you against my will." His voice cracked. "You almost went to prison because of me, and you didn't deserve any of it."

Evelyn's expression remained impassive. She gave a slight shake of her head. "Just tell the truth. That's all I need."

"You have my word, Miss Evelyn!"

Daniel then turned to the police officers and began his confession.

"It started when I was handing out flyers by Yonder River. Exhausted, I sat on a bench to rest. That's when I noticed this girl sitting beside me, lost in thought."

His hands trembled as he continued. "That day, I was promoting a barbecue restaurant to Miss Evelyn. Unlike most people who ignore flyer distributors, she actually listened. She even complimented the location and scanned the QR code to become a member."

A bitter smile crossed his face. "That single act helped me complete my quota. I'd never met Miss Evelyn before that day. She was just a kind stranger."

Gabrielle Winslow's face twisted in rage. She jabbed a finger at Evelyn. "This is your doing! You paid this criminal to frame me and clear your name! You're despicable!"

Evelyn arched one perfect eyebrow, her gaze dripping with disdain. "All I did was have my lawyer locate the mother and son. The truth came out on its own." Her lips curled. "Though I must say, Miss Gabrielle, you do seem to make a habit of these situations."

"You lying witch!" Gabrielle shrieked, her composure shattering. She whirled toward Samuel Rivers. "Don't believe her, Samuel! She orchestrated this entire thing!"

Samuel's gaze flickered between the two women, his expression unreadable.

The officers stepped forward, handcuffs glinting. "Miss Winslow, you'll need to come with us."

Gabrielle stumbled backward in panic. "Amelia! Help me!"

Amelia Rivers moved toward Evelyn, reaching out tentatively. Evelyn sidestepped the contact smoothly.

Amelia's hand dropped to her side, her voice pleading. "Evelyn, please... I didn't know the truth. Gabrielle made a terrible mistake, but she did it for me. Can't you find it in your heart to forgive her?"
###Chapter 311

Gabrielle shot up from her seat, her entire body trembling with denial. "That's a lie! I would never do such a thing!"

Her voice cracked as she pointed an accusing finger at Daniel. "If you keep spreading these false accusations, I'll have my lawyers sue you for slander!"

Nathaniel remained unfazed. Turning to the officers with calm authority, he stated, "It was her. She orchestrated everything. She followed Miss Whitmore from Silver Moon Estate to Yonder River's shoreline."

His gaze never wavered. "She specifically chose me because she'd seen Evelyn speaking with me earlier when I was handing out flyers."

"Gabrielle found Evelyn's dropped phone. Used it to transfer the payment upfront. Then erased all transaction records before having an accomplice 'discover' the phone and turn it in."

"Every detail was meticulously planned to frame Evelyn as the mastermind."

Amelia gasped, pulling away from Samuel's protective embrace. Her wide eyes locked onto her lifelong friend. "Gabrielle... how could you? I explicitly told you not to interfere with Evelyn! My past with Nathaniel has nothing to do with her!"

Tears streamed down Gabrielle's face as she shook her head violently. "Amelia, please! I swear it wasn't me!"

The heartbreak in Amelia's expression cut deeper than any accusation. Without another word, she turned back into her brother's arms, shoulders shaking with silent sobs.

Cornered and desperate, Gabrielle whirled on Evelyn, her manicured finger jabbing the air. "This is your doing! You paid this criminal to accuse me! You're despicable, Evelyn Whitmore!"

Evelyn arched one perfectly shaped eyebrow, her voice dripping with icy disdain. "All I did was instruct my attorney to locate the missing victims. The truth came out on its own. Like everyone else here, I only learned your involvement when Daniel named you."

She tilted her head slightly. "Though I must admit, Miss Winslow, I'm not entirely surprised."

"You vicious little—" Gabrielle's outburst was cut short as the officers stepped forward, handcuffs gleaming.

"Miss Winslow, you'll need to come with us for questioning."

Panic set in as Gabrielle stumbled backward. "Amelia! Help me, please!"

Amelia hesitated, then moved toward Evelyn with outstretched hands. Evelyn sidestepped the contact smoothly, maintaining her distance.

The rejection stung. Amelia's hands fell limply to her sides. "Evelyn... I'm so sorry. I had no idea... what you've endured these past days..." She swallowed hard. "But Gabrielle only acted out of misguided loyalty. Can't you find it in your heart to forgive her? Just this once?"
###Chapter 312

Evelyn's lips curled into a sardonic smile. "How interesting. When I was the suspect, you demanded a full investigation. Now that your dear friend Gabrielle is involved, you're asking me to drop it? The hypocrisy is astounding."

Amelia flushed with discomfort. "I-I never wanted to pursue this. It was my brother who couldn't accept someone trying to harm me, so he—"

The handcuffs still clinked around Evelyn's wrists as she leaned back lazily in her chair. "Save your breath, Miss Rivers. I'd rather let the police handle this properly."

Amelia lowered her gaze but persisted. "I'm sorry, Evelyn. We were wrong to suspect you. But Gabrielle is my closest friend. Please find it in your heart to be merciful—"

Evelyn deliberately turned her attention to Samuel, who stood composed nearby. "You'd move heaven and earth for your sister, wouldn't you, Mr. Rivers? I doubt you'd show such leniency to whoever truly orchestrated this attack."

Amelia's brow furrowed. She whirled toward her brother. "Samuel, you know Gabrielle never meant to hurt me! Her methods were wrong, but her intentions—"

Samuel showed no sympathy for Gabrielle, though familial ties gave him pause. His silence spoke volumes.

Evelyn observed his hesitation with a derisive snort. "I expected better from a man of your standing, Mr. Rivers. Surely you wouldn't compromise your principles just to coddle your precious sister?"

Samuel's expression hardened at the challenge. He met Evelyn's gaze squarely. "Rest assured, Miss Whitmore. If the investigation confirms Daniel's allegations, Gabrielle will face the same consequences you did."

"Promises, promises," Evelyn murmured with false sweetness.

Gabrielle's composure shattered. "It's a setup! Evelyn framed me! Samuel, please—you have to believe me!"

Officers moved swiftly, pinning the struggling woman against the table. The metallic click of handcuffs echoed through the room as they hauled her away for questioning. Simultaneously, Daniel and his family were escorted to separate interrogation rooms for thorough debriefing.

Thirty minutes later, two chastened officers returned to release Evelyn. "Our investigation corroborates Mr. Carter's testimony," one admitted sheepishly. "You were completely uninvolved. We deeply regret our mishandling of this case, especially given your medical condition—"

Evelyn massaged her freed wrists with deliberate calm. "No harm done. We're all victims here—myself, and even your department, manipulated by her schemes."

The officers exchanged stunned glances. They'd braced for accusations of incompetence, not this unexpected absolution. The young woman's maturity in the face of injustice left them humbled.

"Can we at least arrange transportation?" one offered. "After everything you've endured—"

Evelyn waved them off. "I've had enough police vehicles to last a lifetime." Despite her refusal, their grateful smiles followed her out.

Samuel intercepted her exit with an outstretched hand. "Miss Whitmore—"

Evelyn strode past without breaking step, leaving his gesture hanging in empty air. The dismissal stung more than any verbal rebuke. For the first time in his privileged life, Samuel Rivers found himself utterly beneath someone's notice.
###Chapter 313

As Evelyn disappeared through the police station doors, Amelia rushed forward with panic in her eyes. "What's going to happen to Gabrielle now?"

Samuel snapped out of his thoughts and turned to his sister with a stern expression. "She's a grown woman. She made her choices and must face the consequences."

"But she's my closest friend! We can't abandon her now—"

"That's enough. I won't discuss this further. Go home with Benjamin."

Inside the restroom, Evelyn finished washing her hands when Julian appeared in the corridor, holding out a tissue with quiet efficiency. Then he extended his phone toward her. "Mister Nathaniel called. He wishes to speak with you."

Evelyn dried her hands before accepting the call.

Nathaniel's voice carried through the line. "Everything settled, boss? You alright there?"

"All handled. You did well securing those witnesses so quickly. Expect a bonus when I return."

There was an awkward pause. "Actually... it wasn't me, boss."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around the phone. "Explain."

"I arrived too late. Someone else had already gotten to them first."

"Who?"

"If I had to guess? Nathaniel's people. His assistant Lucas had teams investigating Daniel's family for days. They were always one step ahead of us."

The revelation hit Evelyn like a physical blow, leaving her momentarily speechless.

Sebastian continued hesitantly, "If I may say, boss, Mister Nathaniel is actually—"

Evelyn ended the call abruptly, irritation flashing across her features.

Julian observed her darkened expression cautiously. "Would you like me to arrange transportation?"

She tossed the phone back. "No need. Return to your firm—my business here is concluded."

"Understood."

They exited the station separately. Julian offered a formal bow before departing in his sleek sedan. Evelyn watched the car disappear around the corner, her gaze lingering just a moment too long.

When she turned back, her breath caught.

Nathaniel stood at the police station entrance, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit, leaning casually against a white Lamborghini. A cigarette dangled from his fingers, smoke curling lazily into the air as if he had all the time in the world.

Spotting her frozen figure, he crooked a finger. "Come here."

Evelyn forced her feet to move. "Sir."

Nathaniel exhaled a slow stream of smoke, his sharp eyes tracking the direction Julian's car had gone. "Impressive connections you've cultivated, Evelyn."
###Chapter 314

Evelyn turned. The direction of Nathaniel's gaze told her everything—he was watching Julian's car disappear down the street.

"Oh, he was my senior in the law department at university. Incredibly kind. Honestly, I wouldn't have gotten out of this mess without him."

"Kind?" Nathaniel crushed his half-smoked cigarette underfoot. His dark eyes bore into hers. "That man is the most notoriously unapproachable attorney in the city. Yet he drops everything to help a former junior? You must be exceptionally close."

The accusation hung in the air.

Evelyn clenched her jaw. Explaining meant risking her secrets. No plausible lie came to mind. Better to say nothing.

Then—

Sophia appeared out of nowhere, swinging a bucket. She dunked a bundle of sage leaves and flung water straight at Evelyn. "Bad luck, be gone!"

The icy splash hit Evelyn square in the face. She sputtered, coughing.

Nathaniel's expression darkened. In one swift motion, he yanked Evelyn against him, shielding her with his coat. His glare at Sophia could have frozen lava. "What the hell was that?"

Sophia just grinned.

Evelyn burst out laughing.

Nathaniel exhaled sharply but didn't stop her.

Sophia gaped. "Why are you laughing?"

"At you! You're ridiculous!" Still giggling, Evelyn wriggled free and grabbed Sophia's shoulders. "But thanks. I do need to shake off the bad juju. Especially after someone"—she shot Nathaniel a look—"dragged me into his drama."

Sophia smirked. "Hear that, Uncle? You're the bad luck."

Nathaniel pinched the bridge of his nose.

The girls huddled together, whispering and laughing.

Left standing alone, Nathaniel watched Evelyn—carefree, radiant, ignoring him. He straightened the coat she'd wrinkled, lit another cigarette, and exhaled sharply.

"Here for Evelyn?"

The sugary voice made Sophia's smile vanish. Amelia stood there, batting her lashes at Nathaniel.

She'd delayed leaving the station, clinging to her brother for updates about Gabrielle. Spotting Nathaniel, she'd rushed over instantly.

Sophia muttered, "Speak of the devil."

Evelyn's laughter died. She glanced at Nathaniel's softened expression, then away—just in time to see Samuel leaning against his car, waiting for his sister with weary patience.

Lucky Amelia. Always someone to clean up her messes.
###Chapter 315

Evelyn had spent her entire life with no one to lean on. Every hardship, every obstacle—she faced them alone.

Strength had been forged through those trials, but if given the choice, she would never willingly endure them again.

No one would.

Amelia's gentle voice reached Evelyn's ears. "I've already apologized to Evelyn for the misunderstanding, Nathaniel! Gabrielle was just confused—she didn't mean any harm. You've known her for years—you know she isn't a bad person!"

"Could you please convince Evelyn to drop this? Just this once? The police said they'll let Gabrielle go if neither of us presses charges."

Evelyn smirked, turning to Nathaniel. She wanted to see if he'd cave to Amelia's pleading.

Nathaniel's expression was unreadable behind the curl of cigarette smoke. He exhaled slowly. "This isn't the first time Gabrielle has tried to hurt my wife. Even if Evelyn forgives her, I won't."

Evelyn stiffened, staring at him in disbelief.

"Nathaniel—" Amelia's face fell. "I... I understand."

Nathaniel crushed the cigarette underfoot, brushing past Amelia without another glance. He strode toward Evelyn. "Let's go home," he said firmly.

Still dazed, Evelyn barely registered his hand closing around hers as he guided her to the car. He buckled her in, shut the door, then circled to the driver's side.

As he passed Amelia again, he paused. "Go home, Amelia. Samuel is waiting."

Amelia blinked, then nodded. "O-okay."

Sophia Bennett trotted over, grinning. "What about me?"

Nathaniel barely spared her a glance. "Take whatever got you here."

Sophia gaped. "Seriously?! Uncle! You can't just—"

She lunged for the car, but Nathaniel was already pulling away, leaving her coughing in the exhaust.

"Uncle Nathaniel!" she wailed, stomping her foot.

Amelia offered a sympathetic smile. "Would you like a ride? I can ask Samuel—"

Sophia recoiled. "Ugh, no thanks!" She spun on her heel and stormed off, hailing a taxi like Amelia carried the plague.

Amelia watched the car disappear, her sweet expression hardening. Her fingers curled into fists.

"Are you done staring?" Samuel's voice came from behind, weary. "They're gone. Let's go home."

The darkness in Amelia's eyes vanished instantly. She turned, all soft smiles again. "Of course, Samuel. Let's go."
###Chapter 316

Amelia and Benjamin had arrived at the police station in the family chauffeur's car.

But fate had other plans.

Nathaniel insisted Benjamin return home immediately to focus on his studies, leaving no room for argument.

This left Amelia to ride back with Samuel alone.

The moment she slid into Samuel's luxury sedan, her eyes locked onto the delicate amulet dangling from the rearview mirror.

It was no ordinary trinket.

Blessed by the high priest of Celestial Peak Temple, the sacred pendant held a tiny photograph no larger than a thumbnail.

A mother and daughter smiled back at her.

The little girl bore an identical cherry-red birthmark between her brows - just like Amelia's.

Samuel had never been one for spiritual beliefs. Yet he'd gone to great lengths to secure divine protection for these two souls.

Their importance to him was undeniable.

But the faces in the photo weren't hers or her mother's.

They belonged to the first Mrs. Rivers and her daughter Celeste - missing for over a decade. Samuel's birth mother and half-sister.

"Why do you still keep Celeste's picture here?" Amelia's voice turned sharp with jealousy.

Samuel's hands tightened on the steering wheel as he glanced at the amulet. His usual icy gaze softened momentarily.

"So I never forget them."

Amelia's doe eyes flashed with hurt. "That's not fair. Where's the photo of me and Benjamin then?"

"Don't compare yourself to her." His tone remained even.

"Why not?" She crossed her arms. "Because we'll never mean as much to you as Celeste did?"

Samuel heard the pain in her voice. Slowing the car, he reached over to ruffle her hair affectionately.

"Don't be ridiculous. You're right here with me every day. Why would I need your photo when I can see you anytime?"

His expression darkened. "Celeste disappeared when she was five. I don't even know if she's alive out there. The least I can do is pray for her safety."

Amelia bit her lip. "Samuel, you need to let go. After all these years... they're probably..."

She didn't finish the sentence.

A dangerous chill filled the car. Samuel withdrew his hand abruptly.

He refused to entertain such thoughts. In his heart, Celeste and her mother were alive somewhere, living under new identities.

Only Amelia's presence stopped him from ordering her out of the vehicle.

Unaware of his anger, Amelia pouted at the amulet. "I want you to hang my photo too! That way you'll think of me whenever you drive."

Samuel scoffed. "Forget including Benjamin. Three points on his math final? Disgraceful."

Amelia flushed with secondhand embarrassment for her brother. "He's brilliant when he applies himself!"

"With all the tutors we've hired? He's a Rivers - he should be ashamed."

"Fine, just my photo then!"

Samuel exhaled in defeat. He'd never been able to refuse Amelia anything.

"Fine. Tomorrow I'll hang your picture here. Happy now?"

Amelia's radiant smile returned. "Very. Now we're all equal in your heart."
###Chapter 317

Samuel rubbed his temples, exhaustion creeping in. He had always indulged Amelia, but lately, he wondered if he was crossing the line.

Amelia turned her gaze to the window, her lips curling into a smirk. She didn’t care about the photo in Samuel’s car or whether he thought of her while driving. This was about one thing—winning against Celeste.

From childhood, everyone told Amelia how fortunate she was to be a Rivers. Adored, pampered, treated like royalty.

Yet no one knew the truth—no matter how much love she received, she could never surpass that foolish stepsister who vanished over a decade ago.

To honor Celeste, their father built Silver Moon Estate in the heart of the city, where every square inch cost more than a fortune.

Then there was Nathaniel, who always put the missing Celeste above Amelia. As a child, desperate for his affection, she’d even gotten an identical cherry-red mole tattooed between her brows to mimic Celeste.

She hated every second of it. But what choice did she have? Nathaniel hadn’t liked her at first—not when they shared the same mother. So she became Celeste’s shadow, and it worked. Look how he doted on her now.

If anyone lived under Celeste’s ghost, it wasn’t Nathaniel—it was Amelia. That’s why she despised Celeste more than anyone in the world. She wanted her erased from memory.

And then there was Nathaniel again, refusing to make her the most important person in his life. Unacceptable. She wouldn’t be satisfied until she was the center of everyone’s universe.

"Samuel… I’m scared," Amelia whispered, her voice trembling.

Samuel pulled the car over, concern flickering in his eyes. "What’s wrong? You’re safe with me."

She clutched his hand, feigning distress. "It’s Evelyn. I feel like she hates me. After what Gabrielle did… I’m afraid she’ll come after me next."

"Don’t worry," Samuel said firmly. "I’ll assign extra security. No one will lay a finger on you."

The thought of Evelyn dismissing him so coldly still burned. He wouldn’t underestimate her again. He’d already lost one sister—he wouldn’t lose another.

Just then, a sleek sports car roared past in the opposite direction.

Inside, Evelyn glanced at Nathaniel, his focus entirely on the road. She hesitated before speaking. "Thank you."

Nathaniel arched a brow. "For what?"

"For finding that witness today. Without you, the truth might’ve stayed buried."

His grip on the wheel tightened. "How did you know it was me?"

Evelyn froze.

He’d never told her he was involved. As far as he knew, she was just a small-town girl with no connections to dig up classified details.

I can’t tell him Sebastian tipped me off.

She swallowed hard. The lie would have to be convincing.
###Chapter 318

"I was only making an educated guess." Evelyn's voice carried a playful lilt as she adjusted her seatbelt. "Given how attentive you've been lately—and considering our marital status, even if just on paper—it wasn't hard to deduce you'd assist me. Honestly, who else would go through the trouble of locating a new witness for me?"

Nathaniel's grip tightened on the steering wheel, his profile sharp in the afternoon light. "You were that certain I'd intervene?"

"Absolutely." Her smile remained fixed, though her eyes stayed guarded. "I never doubted you for a second."

A dry chuckle escaped him. "Is that why you spent last night mentally cursing me when I didn't return to the hospital?"

Evelyn's fingers stilled on her purse strap. The accusation hit its mark—she had indeed vented her frustration, though not for the reasons he assumed. After Sophia mentioned Nathaniel hadn't returned following Amelia's departure, she'd imagined them lost in nostalgic conversation. The thought of him siding with Amelia's version of events had stung more than she cared to admit.

Her silence spoke volumes. Nathaniel took a sharp turn, the cityscape blurring outside the windows. "For the record, I was following a lead last night. By the time I returned, you were asleep. This morning required my immediate attention elsewhere."

Evelyn blinked. "You came back?"

His eyebrow arched. "You doubt me?"

"No," she said quickly, smoothing her skirt. "I believe you. Thank you for making time despite your schedule. Though I suppose I should thank Lucas for actually tracking down the witness?"

Nathaniel's jaw tensed. "Some matters require personal handling."

"Must've been critical to pull you away." She studied the passing storefronts. "Let me guess—something involving Amelia? Not that I need details. Her affairs don't concern me."

The tires shrieked as Nathaniel slammed the brakes. Evelyn's body jerked forward, the seatbelt cutting into her shoulder. Heart pounding, she whirled toward him. "What the hell was that?"

Thunder darkened Nathaniel's expression as he unbuckled his seatbelt with deliberate slowness. "Nothing concerns you? Is that truly what you believe?"

Evelyn's pulse raced. "Are you saying it does?"

"Evelyn Whitmore." His voice dropped to a dangerous register. "Do my words mean nothing to you?"

"I listen!" She threw up her hands. "But half the time, your actions make no sense. Like right now—what exactly am I supposed to understand?"

"Ask!" The word cracked like a whip. "Instead of assuming!"

Heat flooded her cheeks. "And what right do I have to question you? I'm just your—"

Nathaniel's hand shot out, gripping the headrest beside her. The sudden proximity stole her breath. "Finish that sentence."

Evelyn swallowed hard. The scent of his cologne—spice and something darker—wrapped around her. "Amelia—" she began, but the rest died in her throat.
###Chapter 319

Nathaniel's hand shot out, one palm slamming against the dashboard while the other gripped Evelyn's headrest.

Before she could react, his lips crashed onto hers.

The first touch was deceptively gentle—so featherlight it startled Evelyn. Then the dam broke. His tongue invaded her mouth with desperate urgency.

Evelyn gasped against his lips, shoving at his chest. She barely managed one ragged breath before he claimed her mouth again, harder this time.

"Mr. Grayson, you—mmph!"

Her protest was swallowed by another bruising kiss.

"Stop—get off—"

His fingers tangled in her hair, holding her immobile. He drank from her lips like a man starved, determined to brand this moment into memory.

To Evelyn, this wasn't passion—it was punishment. Spots danced behind her eyelids as oxygen deprivation set in. One more second and she'd pass out.

Mercifully, Nathaniel released her just before that threshold.

"You bastard!" Evelyn wiped her mouth with the back of her hand, chest heaving.

Nathaniel caught her chin, tilting her face to admire his handiwork—her swollen, cherry-red lips. "Between us, darling, you're the bigger bastard here."

Evelyn knocked his hand away. "Explain how."

"Do I need to?" His thumb traced her jawline. Uncharacteristic bitterness darkened his usually composed gaze. "What kind of wife hands her husband to another woman? Even saints aren't that selfless. Tell me, Evelyn—doesn't abandoning me after playing with my feelings make you the villain here?"

'Playing with his feelings? Ridiculous!' The audacity made her blood boil. Though part of her understood—Nathaniel was a man, after all. Maybe one night had sparked unexpected attachment.

But that was just speculation. His true motives remained opaque.

"Listen carefully, Mr. Grayson. One night doesn't give you rights over me. That was an accident—nothing more. If you ever pull this again—"

"Or what?" He arched an eyebrow at her furious expression.

"I'll have you arrested for sexual assault."

Nathaniel threw back his head and laughed—a rich, mocking sound that abruptly cut off as he pinned her with a predatory stare. "Let me make something clear, Evelyn Whitmore. One time was never going to be enough."

Her nails bit into the leather seats. If not for fearing the drug's aftereffects would destroy him, she'd never have—

"The feeling's mutual. Frankly, you should be grateful I slept with you at all."

He leaned in until his breath ghosted over her earlobe. "What I meant was...I intend to have you many more times."

Evelyn recoiled. 'Disgusting pig!'

"All night long," he murmured, lips brushing her ear. "Until neither of us can move. How does that sound?"

Her stomach clenched. 'How many times does this man think—'

"Stop being vile." She turned her face away. Evelyn would never trust the sweet nothings of a man who'd recently proclaimed undying love to his ex.
###Chapter 320

"Scumbag? Explain to me exactly how I qualify as one?" Nathaniel's brow furrowed in irritation.

Evelyn opened her mouth to respond when her phone buzzed in her pocket, cutting her off mid-thought. She pulled it out and glanced at the screen—no name, just a string of digits.

Numbers had always stuck in her mind like glue. One look was all it took to recognize Amelia's number.

"Here, Mister." She shoved the phone toward him, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "Your precious Amelia is calling." She turned her gaze out the window, granting him the illusion of privacy.

Nathaniel took the phone without checking the screen and swiped to decline the call. "Evelyn Whitmore," he commanded, voice sharp. "Look at me."

She turned slowly, her striking eyes filled with icy disdain. "And then what?"

His gaze locked onto hers, intense and unyielding. "The reason I asked you to go to Silver Moon Estate that day—"

The phone rang again. The shrill tone grated on his nerves, relentless.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Maybe you should answer. Could be an emergency."

Nathaniel exhaled sharply and accepted the call, putting it on speaker.

"Nathaniel, are you home yet?" Amelia's voice, soft and honeyed, floated through the line.

"Not yet. What do you need?"

"Samuel's car broke down on Yonder Bridge. We're stranded. Can you come get us?" Her helpless sigh was perfectly timed.

"Where are his subordinates? Can't he call them?" Nathaniel's tone was flat.

"His phone died, and he doesn't remember any of their numbers. You're the only one I have saved." A delicate pause. "And... I'm not feeling well." Her voice trembled.

"I'll send someone."

Amelia's breath hitched. "Nathaniel, you just left the hospital. You're close by. Can't you come yourself? Or..." A wounded pause. "Is Evelyn stopping you?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes so hard it hurt. Always making me the villain. Pathetic.

"Nathaniel, my condition... it's flaring up again. I don't think your men will get here in time." Her voice weakened dramatically. "I—I really don't feel good..."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. Two seconds of silence. "Send me your location."

"Thank you!" Relief colored her voice. "I'll text it now."

The call ended. Evelyn had already unbuckled her seatbelt, hand on the door handle.

Nathaniel's grip closed around her wrist like a vice. "Where do you think you're going?"

"Taking a cab. Wouldn't want anyone accusing me of keeping you from your damsel in distress." She smirked, but her eyes were cold.

His expression darkened. "Sit. You're coming with me."

She scoffed but buckled up as he spun the car around, tires screeching toward Yonder Bridge.

Evelyn crossed her arms. "This is a bad idea. I shouldn't be there when you pick her up."

Nathaniel's grip on the steering wheel tightened. "You're the one I want."

Her breath caught—just for a second—before she deadpanned, "Don't joke about things like that. I'd never—"
###Chapter 321

"Quiet! I'm driving, so don't say anything that might piss me off right now. Just sit still, and I'll explain everything later. Behave, okay?" Nathaniel's voice was firm yet laced with a coaxing undertone, his gaze never leaving the road ahead.

Evelyn scowled but sank back into her seat without protest. A storm of emotions churned inside her as she stared blankly at the blur of scenery outside the window.

Midway across the Cross River Bridge, a sleek sedan with hazard lights flashing was parked on the shoulder.

Nathaniel drove past it before pulling over. Evelyn had no intention of moving, but he reached across anyway, unbuckling her seatbelt with deliberate precision.

"What are you waiting for? Get out."

Reluctantly, she stepped out into the crisp evening air.

Amelia greeted them the moment they exited the car. She coughed delicately before speaking. "Nathaniel, you made it!"

Nathaniel gave her a curt nod before turning to Samuel, who stood beside the stalled vehicle. "What's wrong with your car?"

Samuel tapped the hood. "Engine might've taken in water. Died after hitting a puddle."

Nathaniel tossed him the keys to his own car. "Take your sister home in mine."

Samuel caught them effortlessly, his expression briefly stiff before smoothing into a practiced smile. "Appreciate the rescue."

His gaze flickered to Evelyn, who stood silently to the side. He couldn't help but marvel at how effortlessly she seemed to command Nathaniel's attention. The man who once prioritized Amelia above all else now barely spared her a second glance.

"Nathaniel, how will you get back? Why not just drive us home yourself?" Amelia pressed, anxiety threading her voice.

"Not happening. We're taking a walk," Nathaniel replied, ruffling Evelyn's hair pointedly.

Evelyn barely suppressed an eye roll. Since when did I agree to this?

A shadow flickered in Amelia's eyes as she watched Nathaniel's hand linger on Evelyn. But she forced a smile. "It's windy up here. Evelyn might catch a cold. We should all leave together."

Nathaniel shrugged off his coat and draped it over Evelyn's shoulders. "She'll be fine. Someone's picking us up later. You said you weren't feeling well—stop standing around and get in the car. Samuel will take you home."

"But Nathaniel—"

He ignored her completely this time, turning to Evelyn. "Let's go. We need to talk."

His hands settled on her shoulders, steering her toward the riverwalk.

Amelia stood frozen, teeth clenched as she watched them walk away. She had sabotaged Samuel's car herself, certain Nathaniel would prioritize her—the frail, sickly one—over Evelyn. Yet here he was, choosing her instead.

"Amelia, let's go." Samuel's voice snapped her out of her thoughts.

She nodded mechanically, following him to Nathaniel's sports car.

Once inside, she pulled out her phone, fingers flying over the screen.

[Nathaniel, I'm sorry for dragging you out here. Did I upset Evelyn again? I didn't mean to. I just felt so unwell earlier. Could you explain that to her? I'm worried she might be angry with me.]

A soft chime sounded from Nathaniel's pocket.

Evelyn glanced at the screen before tossing the phone back to him.

"Your precious Amelia texted you."
###Chapter 322

Nathaniel didn't bother checking the message. He simply powered off his phone and slipped it into his pocket.

Evelyn leaned against the steel railing of the bridge, gazing at the horizon. The river breeze played with her hair, giving her the appearance of a timeless beauty from an oil painting.

The bridge overlooked the Silver Peaks embankment, offering a panoramic view of New Capital City's most impressive skyscrapers.

"Careful. Wouldn't want you tumbling into the river."

Nathaniel grabbed her collar from behind like scooping up a stray kitten. In three seconds flat, he ruined Evelyn's picturesque moment. Her feet dangled helplessly, making her choke with discomfort.

'God, he's insufferable! Why does he keep treating me like some clueless child?' Evelyn fumed internally.

"Put me down! I'm not some idiot who'd fall off a bridge!" she protested.

Nathaniel carried her several steps back from the railing before releasing her. Her shoes finally met solid ground again.

He looked down with that infuriating smirk. "You sure about that?"

"Absolutely!" Evelyn snapped.

"Then why can't you see it?"

"See what?"

"Use that brain of yours," he growled.

Evelyn rolled her eyes, changing the subject. "When's your driver coming to get us?"

Nathaniel shoved his hands in his pockets, staring at the river. "No one's coming."

'What? He told Amelia someone would be here soon!'

Her brows knitted together. "We're walking home? Seriously?"

Nathaniel arched an eyebrow. "Problem? I thought young couples enjoyed aimless strolls."

"You're joking, right? That's so last decade! Who does that anymore? Have you smelled the exhaust fumes?" She wrinkled her nose in disgust.

Nathaniel's expression darkened.

Evelyn nearly laughed at his outdated notion when realization struck. 'Wait—did he just say "couples"? Is he implying this is a date?'

Nathaniel leaned down to her eye level, his gaze intense. "Then enlighten this old man. What do young people do on dates these days?"

Evelyn blinked, thrown off balance. 'He's definitely acting strange.'

Her mouth twitched. "Uh... dinner, drinks, movies, escape rooms... that sort of thing."

Nathaniel frowned. Aside from dining, everything sounded like frivolous time-wasters to a man of his stature.

"You enjoy those activities?"

"I guess. Went to some escape rooms with classmates—pretty fun," she admitted.

"Male or female classmates?" Nathaniel's voice turned sharp.

Evelyn suddenly felt like a teenager caught breaking curfew. Then she remembered—she was an adult. Nothing to feel guilty about.

"Both! Stop being so archaic!"

'Archaic?' Nathaniel's jaw tightened. He pinched the bridge of his nose, struggling to maintain composure.

"Evelyn Whitmore, you..."
###Chapter 323

Evelyn's stomach growled loudly, betraying her hunger.

Nathaniel's anger dissipated the moment he heard it. His intense gaze softened as he reached out to ruffle her hair. "Alright, let's start with dinner. What do you feel like eating?"

Start with dinner? Evelyn's pulse quickened. What exactly does he mean by that? Should I ask? No—I don’t want him thinking I’m reading too much into this.

She rubbed her empty stomach and averted her eyes. "Anything's fine. But I'm too exhausted to walk anymore."

Before she could finish, Nathaniel swept her off her feet, cradling her effortlessly against his chest.

Evelyn stiffened, her face burning. "Nathaniel—what are you doing?"

He strode forward without hesitation, glancing down at her. "You said you didn’t want to walk."

She sputtered. "I meant call a car! Not—not this!"

"Same result," he said smoothly. "You’re not walking either way."

Evelyn groaned. His logic was annoyingly sound.

"This is embarrassing," she hissed. "We’re on the Yonder Bridge. Every passing car is going to stare!"

"We’re married," he countered. "Nothing to be ashamed of."

"That’s not the point! People will think we’re insane!"

"Relax. No photos of me circulate without my permission."

Evelyn gritted her teeth. That’s not the issue!

Trapped, she buried her face against his chest like a coward. If she couldn’t see the stares, they didn’t exist.

Eventually, the wind died down. She peeked—they were off the bridge.

"Thank you," she said quickly. "You must be tired. Put me down—I can walk now."

Nathaniel set her on her feet, eyes gleaming. "For the record, I wasn’t tired. You weigh nothing."

Evelyn scoffed. "Right. If ‘nothing’ means thirty-six kilos."

He chuckled, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear. "What am I going to do with you?"

Her breath hitched. Damn him and his charm.

She cleared her throat and scanned the area. "Taxis will be scarce here. There’s a subway station ahead—let’s take that."

Nathaniel nodded, following her lead.

At the station, Evelyn moved to buy tickets—but Nathaniel’s fingers flew over the machine, producing two Line 7 passes in seconds.

She blinked. The last time they’d taken the subway, he’d needed Lucas’s help.

"Impressive," she teased. "You’ve mastered the subway now?"
###Chapter 324

"I figured I should learn the subway routes after our first ride together."

Nathaniel bent down to collect the transit cards from the ticket machine. His fingers closed around Evelyn's wrist as he guided her toward the turnstiles, swiping their cards with practiced ease before leading them to the platform.

Evelyn was too distracted questioning his sudden interest in public transportation to notice he hadn't released her hand. "Why bother learning this when you've got chauffeurs? Seems pointless to me."

Nathaniel's lips curved in that infuriating half-smile she knew too well. "Weren't you the one lecturing me about experiencing normal life?"

Evelyn's mouth snapped shut. She remembered that conversation at the Silver Peaks Ranch all too clearly - her desperate attempt to prove to Gabrielle that she wasn't some gold-digger.

"That was just talk. You actually started riding the subway because of me?"

"Are you suggesting I'm not normal?" Nathaniel's eyebrow arched.

Evelyn snorted. "Normal? You're the definition of a corporate shark."

"Have I ever taken advantage of you?" Amusement laced his voice.

"Three months of my life, for starters!" Evelyn jabbed a finger at his chest. "Not to mention all the chaos since the day we met."

Nathaniel suddenly stilled, his expression turning serious.

"I'm sorry."

The unexpected apology threw her off balance.

"Whatever. We're both to blame - I kissed you first. Just promise this arrangement ends in three months."

"Agreed."

"And no extensions," Evelyn added sharply. "When time's up, we're done."

Nathaniel's gaze turned intense. "You sound terrified I won't let you go."

"Damn right!" Evelyn nodded vigorously. "I want my freedom back. No more being at your mercy."

The air between them shifted as Nathaniel's eyes darkened. "Evelyn Whitmore, consider yourself free. Effective immediately."

Her heart leapt. "Seriously?"

"Dead serious."

"Thank God!" Evelyn yanked her hand free. "See you never, Nathaniel."

She'd barely taken two steps when an iron grip hauled her back.

"Did I say you could leave?" His voice had turned glacial.

Evelyn gaped. "You literally just-"

"I'm releasing you from our arrangement," Nathaniel clarified. "But I'd like you to consider becoming my actual wife."

The platform seemed to tilt beneath her feet. Had she heard correctly? Was this... a proposal?

"Evelyn?" Nathaniel tapped her nose, snapping her from her daze.

"You asked why I learned the subway?" His fingers slid down to intertwine with hers, his grip almost desperate. "I couldn't risk you ditching me somewhere I couldn't follow."

Evelyn felt her resolve crumbling as Nathaniel's thumb traced circles on her wrist. This wasn't part of their act - no audience, no cameras. Her gaze darted around the station, searching for Grayson family spies.

Nathaniel sighed, recognizing her suspicion. "No one's watching, Evelyn. This is just me."

The approaching train's rumble mirrored the chaos in her chest. Three months suddenly felt terrifyingly short.
###Chapter 325

Nathaniel adjusted Evelyn's face gently, guiding her toward the platform to catch the approaching train.

As they walked, his voice turned serious. "Evelyn Whitmore, let's begin again."

She tilted her head, skepticism flashing in her eyes. "How exactly?"

"Proper dates this time. Will you give this old man another chance?"

Evelyn's brow furrowed. "Sir, I don't believe we're—"

He didn't let her finish. "Hear me out first. Let me properly court you this time. No more forcing my lifestyle on you. I'll adapt to yours."

The train's arrival drowned out her response. The screeching brakes silenced any further conversation as Nathaniel pulled her aboard.

Rush hour packed the subway car. Towering over the crowd, Nathaniel stood out effortlessly. Women's gazes kept drifting toward him while Evelyn found herself pressed against his chest.

She squirmed, trying to create space. But the surrounding male passengers made Nathaniel tighten his grip. "Stay put," he murmured, resting his chin atop her head.

His deep voice vibrated through her. "There's nothing between Amelia and me. She saved my life once—that's all. I owe her, but that's the extent of it."

So he had heard her earlier remark. "Yet you practically promised yourself to her," Evelyn countered.

Nathaniel's grip tightened slightly. "She was ten years old then. What kind of promise could that be?"

"Nothing stops you now that she's grown," Evelyn shot back, though the bitterness in her voice betrayed her true feelings.

Amusement colored his tone. "Would you prefer I pledge myself to you instead? My heart, my body—they're yours if you'll have them."

The train lurched, pressing them closer. Evelyn could feel his heartbeat against her back, steady and strong.

"Your generosity is overwhelming," she muttered, but didn't pull away.

Nathaniel chuckled, the sound rumbling through her. "Only for you, Evelyn. Only ever for you."

Around them, the subway car continued its journey, oblivious to the quiet revolution happening between two souls pressed together in the crowd.
###Chapter 326

The subway car rattled along the tracks as Evelyn pressed her face into Nathaniel's chest. His whispered confession had left her dizzy, her cheeks burning crimson.

She prayed no one had overheard, though the noisy carriage made that impossible. His words had been meant for her ears alone.

"Don't be ridiculous," she muttered against his shirt. "I never saved you."

Nathaniel's arms tightened around her. "That rainy night - it was you. I always knew."

Evelyn stiffened. Even now, the memory made her squirm with embarrassment.

"And you rescued me from those kidnappers," she countered. "We're even. No obligations."

Nathaniel exhaled sharply. Even after his heartfelt declaration, she still pushed him away. Normally so perceptive, yet now willfully blind.

"Stop being stubborn," he chided, fingers combing through her hair. "I know how much that night cost you. The struggle you went through before helping me."

A sniffle escaped Evelyn. No one had ever acknowledged her inner turmoil like this. Not mocked or dismissed, but seen and understood.

Growing up bullied, she'd learned to armor herself. Now everyone saw only the unbreakable facade. She'd almost convinced herself it was real.

Until Nathaniel smashed through her defenses.

His sigh ruffled her hair. "So much for romance. You walked right past that tulip garden I prepared. And now my confession happens in this noisy tin can."

Evelyn jerked back. "Wait - those tulips at Silver Moon Estate were for me?"

Nathaniel's smug look demanded praise.

She narrowed her eyes. "Liar! What about your public confession for Amelia at Yonder River?"

Patiently, he explained, "I've spent days tracking down who spread those rumors. Someone wanted you to doubt me."

Evelyn blinked rapidly, struggling to process this.

Leaning close, Nathaniel's breath tickled her ear. "Think, Evelyn. With my position, public declarations are dangerous. They'd make you a target."

The kidnapping flashed through her mind - proof of his words.

"The confession was for a woman named Charlotte Bennett. Pure coincidence about the nickname. I can show you the booking receipts."

Understanding dawned.

Nathaniel's lips brushed her earlobe. "Tell me, did you curse my name that day by the river?"

Mortified, Evelyn nodded. She'd thought he'd summoned her to witness his love for Amelia. The guilt of that misunderstanding weighed heavy.

"Next time," he said, stroking her hair, "just ask me instead of assuming the worst."

"Fine," she mumbled, pride yielding to remorse.

With the air cleared, Evelyn relaxed slightly in his embrace. Nathaniel exhaled in relief. That night she'd disappeared after the tulip incident, he'd scoured the city in panic. The fear of her vanishing again haunted him.

He pressed her closer, wishing he could merge their bodies so she'd never leave.

The subway screeched to their stop. Nathaniel guided Evelyn out, intent on taking her somewhere quiet - until...
###Chapter 327

Evelyn opted for a nearby burger joint. She was ravenous and needed food immediately.

Nathaniel despised fast food, considering it unhealthy. But seeing her hunger, he didn't protest. Filling her stomach took priority.

She ordered a combo meal with extra sides while Nathaniel simply paid without ordering. They sat facing each other - her devouring fries, him watching with affectionate amusement.

As Evelyn sipped her milkshake, a thought struck her. "Nathaniel, did you pick me because I can handle kidnappers? So you wouldn't be blackmailed if I could fight back?"

He blinked, surprised she'd guessed. "Partly. I needed someone who wouldn't be collateral damage. The woman I'd arranged got weather-delayed. Then you appeared - brave, clever, capable. Perfect." His voice softened. "But I'll protect you now."

Evelyn just chuckled. She'd asked out of curiosity, not concern.

"You must be parched after that speech." She offered her milkshake straw.

Nathaniel's heart skipped. This rare gesture from Evelyn made him lean forward to sip.

She reclaimed the drink, continuing as if sharing straws was routine between them.

His eyes darkened playfully. "So we're sharing fluids now?"

Evelyn smirked. "We've shared more than that."

"Then give us another chance?" Nathaniel's voice held hopeful amusement.

"Trial basis," she countered, raising an eyebrow.

"Trial?" His smile faltered.

"To test compatibility. If it works, we continue. If not..." She shrugged. "We're from different worlds, Nathaniel. This makes ending things cleaner."

Nathaniel groaned internally. This woman would be the death of him.

He tilted her chin up. "Are kisses allowed during this...trial?"

Evelyn's cheeks pinked. "Depends on my mood."

"And now?"

"Meh."

"Why?"

She scoffed. "Would you be cheerful after being handcuffed to a police station?"

Guilt flashed across Nathaniel's face. He checked her wrists, relieved to find no marks from the cuffs.

His phone rang - Lucas calling. Nathaniel's expression darkened as he listened. "When?" he demanded sharply.

Evelyn watched curiously as he stood. "I need to take this. Stay here, finish eating."

She nodded, wondering if Amelia was ill again.

Outside, Nathaniel paced while Evelyn gazed through the window, boredom setting in.

Nearby, two customers whispered loudly while passing.

"That scammer girl trending online is shameless! Healthy young thing conning people with some old man."

"Karma will get her. Look - isn't that her?"

Gasps spread. "It is her! The internet scammer!"

Before Evelyn could react, a crowd surrounded her, phones raised to capture her image.
###Chapter 328

Evelyn's brow furrowed as she scanned the crowd encircling her. Despite the confusion, her pulse remained steady. "Delete those photos immediately. You have no right to photograph me without consent."

Snickers and jeers erupted from the mob.

"Rights? You're lecturing us about rights?"

"Look at her sipping soda like she didn't just ruin someone's life!"

"Pure evil. Doesn't know the meaning of remorse."

"Not even human, if you ask me."

Evelyn's fingers twitched toward her empty pocket. No phone. Nathaniel still had it.

She squared her shoulders. "You've mistaken me for someone. I'm no celebrity or influencer. Explain yourselves."

A woman shoved forward. "Oh, we know exactly who you are! That pretty face scamming innocent people!"

"Scamming?" Evelyn's voice sharpened. "When?"

"Oscar-worthy performance right there!"

"Should audition for Hollywood with those acting skills!"

Evelyn's patience thinned. "I don't know any of you. Someone explain. Now."

A man thrust his phone in her face. The screen showed grainy footage of Evelyn assisting a blind elder near Silver Peaks Bridge weeks prior.

The edited clip twisted the scene - making it appear the old man deliberately damaged a car while Evelyn demanded compensation. Only her face remained uncensored, every detail crystal clear.

Recognition struck. That night. The purple-haired streamer. Nathaniel's confiscated phone.

'Did Samuel Rivers release this?' Her nails bit into her palms. 'After everything I did for his grandfather? The Rivers family truly are vipers.'

A soda cup exploded against her blouse. Iced liquid seeped through fabric.

"That's for Scarlett!" the thrower yelled. "She's quitting streaming because of you!"

"Scarlett inspired millions!" another screamed. "You destroyed her career!"
###Chapter 329

"Poor Scarlett. It's all your fault!"

"You'll get what's coming to you, you wicked woman!"

Evelyn shook off her initial shock and inhaled deeply. Methodically, she pulled tissues from her purse and dabbed at the soda dripping down her face. Her gaze lifted to confront the misguided crowd, their ignorance almost palpable. She mentally repeated calming mantras, resisting the urge to retaliate. Fresh from police custody, the last thing she needed was another altercation landing her back in a cell.

'Scarlett must be that purple-haired influencer,' Evelyn deduced.

The soda-throwing instigator remained furious. "Everyone! Let's show this shameless woman what happens when you mess with Scarlett! Dump your drinks on her!"

"Disgusting creature doesn't deserve to drink anything!"

"My soda's going straight to her face!"

"Let's do it together!"

As hands raised with carbonated weapons, Evelyn instinctively recoiled.

"Have you no decency?" A razor-sharp voice sliced through the din, instantly chilling the fast-food joint's atmosphere.

All heads swiveled toward the entrance where a towering figure stood - dark expression, aristocratic bearing, and an aura that commanded silence.

'Good heavens, he's divine,' several women simultaneously thought, clutching their chests.

"Bullying a defenseless woman? Pathetic. Disperse now or I'll have you arrested. You'll leave here in handcuffs if you don't move."

Nathaniel's authoritative presence paralyzed the crowd. Even in stillness, he exuded regal intimidation - like some wrathful deity pronouncing judgment from Olympus.

The harassers automatically parted, creating a path. Nathaniel strode toward Evelyn, his jaw tightening at the sticky mess coating her hair and clothes.

He'd been gone mere minutes. This shouldn't have happened. Again, he'd failed to shield her. The guilt gnawed at him.

Without hesitation, Nathaniel seized Evelyn's half-finished soda and hurled its contents in a wide arc. Brown liquid splattered across every attacker's face without exception.

The empty cup clattered to the floor. Cradling Evelyn's face, Nathaniel tenderly wiped away residual stickiness with his handkerchief.

"You're safe now. Let's go home," he murmured, tucking a damp strand behind her ear.

Evelyn nodded mutely, following him through the chaotic restaurant. Arguing with these manipulated fools was pointless - they were merely puppets dancing to some unseen schemer's tune.

The crowd watched their retreat with conflicted expressions - resentment warring with self-preservation. Though none recognized Nathaniel, something primal warned them against interference.

"Ahem! That's obviously her accomplice! Why are we scared?"

"He's probably involved too! We should expose them both!"

Emboldened, someone rallied the group to pursue the departing pair, phones raised for incriminating photos.
###Chapter 330

Evelyn barely stepped out of the diner when she heard thunderous footsteps behind her.

She spun around. The same furious crowd was charging toward her. Worse, paparazzi had gotten wind of her location—cameras raised, they sprinted in her direction.

Nathaniel and Evelyn exchanged a glance. A taxi was out of the question. Drivers these days were wary of scammers staging accidents for insurance fraud. The last thing they needed was their driver turning on them.

"Run!" Evelyn seized Nathaniel's wrist, dragging him into motion. She wasn't scared, just annoyed. These people were relentless, and she couldn't exactly fight them off.

Then there was Nathaniel's reputation to consider. One scandal could tank Grayson Enterprises' stocks. She refused to let something this petty ruin him.

They ducked into a narrow alley, the mob and reporters hot on their heels. At the last second, Nathaniel yanked Evelyn behind a stack of discarded crates. They held their breath until the chaos faded.

Evelyn exhaled, chest heaving from the sprint.

Nathaniel studied her, brow furrowed. "You shouldn't run right after eating. You'll get cramps."

She blinked up at him. "What, should we have stood there and brawled instead?"

He pinched her flushed cheeks. "I would've handled it. You just had to watch."

Evelyn scowled. "Nathaniel, I don't want you to—"

"Found them!" a voice shrieked.

"They're over here!"

"Don't let them escape!"

Evelyn's stomach dropped. "They spotted us! Go—I'll hold them off!"

Nathaniel's grip tightened. "I'm not leaving you."

Her abdomen twinged—proof he'd been right about running post-meal. "Just go! I'll distract them!"

His expression darkened. Did she really think he'd abandon her?

She shoved at his chest. He didn't budge.

Tires screeched. Lucas's car skidded into the alley, window rolling down. "Sir! Get in!"

Nathaniel hauled Evelyn into the backseat. Lucas floored it before the doors fully shut.

The mob reached the alley mouth just in time to see a sleek Mercedes AMG GT vanishing.

"Isn't that a limited-edition Benz?" someone spat.

"That scammer probably bought it with stolen money! And that pretty boy's just after her cash. Disgusting!"

"Post their photos online! Expose them!"

"Let's dox him too! Justice for the victims!"

The engine roared as Lucas sped away, leaving the outcry behind.
###Chapter 331

"Absolutely! I'm with you on this! Let's make it happen!"

"I captured crystal-clear footage earlier—I'm uploading it right now!"

"Count me in! If we all join forces, that fraudster won't stand a chance!"

The sleek Mercedes-Benz gradually steadied its pace.

Evelyn settled into the plush leather seat, taking a moment to breathe. The nausea had subsided, leaving her more composed. She extended her hand. "Hand me the phone, Nathaniel."

Nathaniel's expression darkened as he retrieved his phone, but just as Evelyn reached for it, he abruptly lifted it out of her grasp. His voice was icy. "Before I give it to you, explain why you told me to leave without you."

Evelyn's brow furrowed. "Because... I didn’t want you caught on camera!"

Nathaniel's gaze turned stormy. She still kept him at arm's length, as if he were some kind of liability.

Recognizing his displeasure, Evelyn quickly backtracked. "Remember what you said about your position making you a target? If those people got footage of us together, they might see you as vulnerable. I’m just thinking ahead—for both of us."

Nathaniel’s stern expression softened slightly. Her roundabout reassurance worked—she’d admitted he mattered to her. With a scoff, he ruffled her hair. "At least you’ve got some sense of self-preservation."

Evelyn pursed her lips and held out her hand again. "Phone. Now."

Relenting, he handed it over.

She immediately scrolled through the day’s headlines. The trending section showed no trace of the scandal—Nathaniel’s team had clearly scrubbed it clean. But the damage was done. The video had already spread like wildfire through private chats, and she knew most of the internet had likely seen it by now.

She traced the source of the chaos back to an influencer named Scarlett, who’d spun a sob story about being swindled out of $150,000, claiming it had ruined her life and left her mother ill. The edited clips made Evelyn look like the villain, and the online mob had swallowed it whole.

The comments were a cesspool of vitriol, with strangers wishing her harm.

A sharp pang shot through her stomach—whether from stress or some twisted karma, she didn’t know—and she doubled over with a wince.

Nathaniel’s sharp eyes caught the movement. "What’s wrong?" he demanded, voice low.

"Nothing," she muttered. "Just... stomach cramps."

"Shouldn’t have been running around like that," he chided, though his tone was softer now. In one swift motion, he pulled her onto his lap and pressed a warm palm to her abdomen, massaging in slow circles.

The heat helped, but embarrassment flared. "Stop—Lucas is right there!"

Nathaniel arched a brow. "And? There’s nowhere on you I haven’t touched before."

Evelyn’s cheeks burned. She shot a mortified glance at Lucas, who was dutifully pretending not to hear. "Nathaniel! Have you no shame?"
###Chapter 332

Lucas deliberately raised the partition window, sealing off the front seats from the back.

Out of sight, out of mind—wasn’t that how the saying went?

He didn’t need Nathaniel’s sharp gaze burning holes into him.

Nathaniel rubbed Evelyn’s stomach gently until her complexion regained some color. Then, he pulled out a damp cloth, wiping the sticky soda from her face. His heart ached, but frustration simmered beneath the surface.

“You’re always so fierce with me,” he muttered, voice low. “Why didn’t you fight back when they threw that drink on you?”

Evelyn rolled her eyes. “I’m not a rabid dog, Nathaniel. If a dog bites you, do you bite it back? No. You handle it like a human.”

She crossed her arms. “Besides, those people are just mindless sheep, blinded by whatever nonsense is trending online. My real issue is with whoever orchestrated this mess behind the scenes.”

Nathaniel sighed, ruffling her hair. “Let me handle this. Stay home for a few days until things calm down.”

Evelyn scowled. “Why should I hide? I didn’t do anything wrong.”

He softened his tone. “Then don’t hide. But you’re coming to the office with me tomorrow.”

Her breath hitched. With him? To the office? That meant going public.

She hesitated, then shook her head. “No. You’ll be working, and I’ll just be bored.”

Nathaniel’s expression darkened. “Cyberbullying isn’t a joke, Evelyn. Just this once, let me worry about you.”

Her pulse skipped. This is what it feels like to be cared for.

She cleared her throat. “I can take care of myself. I won’t let anyone walk all over me.”

Nathaniel didn’t push further. Forcing her would only make her pull away.

He’d learned that much.

She wasn’t like other women—she was a wild songbird. The tighter he held, the faster she’d slip through his fingers.

Resigned, he pinched her cheek. “Fine. You’re terrifying with me, but a saint with everyone else.”

Evelyn frowned. Is he saying I’m mean to him?

Before, their relationship had been purely transactional. She avoided him unless necessary.

Now, they were trying to make this work—but she wasn’t ready for him to treat her like some helpless child.

That same evening, in a crumbling apartment complex on the outskirts of the city, Daniel Carter’s wife returned from the police station with their son, Oliver.

Tears streaked both their faces.

Oliver had just learned his father was a criminal. His small world shattered.

After finally calming him down and tucking him into bed, the doorbell rang.

Daniel’s wife hesitated before answering.

A woman stood outside—cap pulled low, oversized sunglasses, and a mask covering half her face. A black suitcase weighed heavily in her grip.

“H-Hello?” Daniel’s wife stammered. “Can I help you?”

The woman didn’t answer.

She pushed past her, stepping inside, then removed her sunglasses and mask.
###Chapter 333

Amelia Rivers stood in the cramped living room, her designer heels sinking slightly into the worn carpet.

Eleanor Carter's eyes widened in recognition. "Miss Amelia! It's you!"

She had met Amelia at the police station that day. The memory was vivid, especially after her husband Daniel's detailed accounts.

Eleanor gestured nervously toward the faded couch. "Please, have a seat! Let me get you some water."

Amelia's gaze swept over the shabby furniture, her lips curling in distaste. "No need. I won't be staying long."

The dismissive tone left Eleanor frozen, hands twisting in her apron.

Without ceremony, Amelia snapped open her leather briefcase and dropped it onto the chipped coffee table. "Tell your husband to keep quiet. If he does, he'll be out soon. After that, your family disappears from this city." She tapped the stacks of cash inside. "This should cover your pathetic little lives."

Eleanor's breath hitched at the sight. "Of course, Miss Amelia! Daniel told me everything during my visit today. We know how this works."

"Good." Amelia's smirk was ice-cold. She turned on her heel and strode out, leaving the briefcase behind.

The moment she reached her Mercedes, she sprayed her hands with sanitizer. The rundown neighborhood made her skin crawl. Filth clung to the air. She wouldn't have set foot here if not for necessity.

Bank transfers left trails. Cash didn't.

This entire scheme had been meticulously planned. Evelyn Whitmore had slipped through her fingers once, but Gabrielle Winslow made the perfect scapegoat.

It started when Amelia flew back to surprise Nathaniel at Silver Moon Estate. Instead, he'd rushed off after Evelyn. She'd followed—only to find Evelyn alone by the riverbank.

The news of Evelyn's marriage to the Graysons had been a knife to her ribs. So she'd orchestrated this. Hired Daniel Carter to stage an attack and frame Evelyn.

But Evelyn had outmaneuvered her.

No matter. Amelia always had contingencies. She'd prepped Daniel with alternate scenarios and Gabrielle's photo. If Plan A failed, he'd swear Gabrielle was the mastermind.

A small price to pay. Gabrielle's loyalty meant nothing compared to Nathaniel.

Her phone buzzed. Samuel Rivers.

Amelia's voice softened instantly. "Sam?"

"Where are you?" Her brother's tone was sharp. "Grandparents are here. We're waiting for dinner."

"I just got back, and some old friends insisted on catching up. All girls, don't worry!" She forced a laugh. "I'll be home soon."

The moment she hung up, her face hardened. She tossed the phone aside and lit a cigarette, exhaling smoke with practiced ease. The docile mask was gone.

Glancing at her watch, she smiled. By now, Evelyn's reputation should be in ruins online.

It didn't matter that the first plan failed. There were other ways.

Nathaniel might want Evelyn, but the Grayson elders would never accept a scandal-ridden bride. Evelyn's days were numbered.

Amelia took a long drag.

How dare some nobody steal what's mine?
###Chapter 334

Amelia Rivers had obtained Scarlett Monroe's data from her brother and discreetly copied it to her phone.

She edited the video, blurred her grandfather's face, and hacked into Scarlett's account using specialized software. Then, she posted the manipulated footage online, framing Evelyn Whitmore for the so-called "evil deeds." The internet erupted in chaos.

The real Scarlett fled back to her hometown, too terrified to even glance at social media after her brother's warning.

Her brother had always turned a blind eye to her misdeeds. Anyone who crossed their family faced consequences—no exceptions, regardless of status. He remained indifferent to outsiders, and even if he saw the false scandal about Evelyn, he wouldn’t lift a finger. It wasn’t his problem.

As for their grandfather, he was a renowned scientist, buried in research within his lab. The internet held no interest for him. A recent experiment had exposed him to toxic fumes, leaving him bedridden. He wouldn’t discover Amelia’s scheme—not while he was still recovering.

But Amelia wasn’t satisfied. The trending topic had been removed, the outrage fading too quickly. She knew Nathaniel Grayson had stepped in to protect Evelyn. The realization made her blood boil. Why did Evelyn deserve his help?

Determined to escalate things, Amelia hatched another plan. She grabbed her phone, logged into a fake account, and fabricated a damning post about Evelyn.

[I know her! We went to school together. She was a nightmare—bullied classmates, extorted money, slept around, and even had multiple abortions. Instead of going home, she spent nights in hotels with random men. Now she’s scamming people for cash. Disgusting!]

The post spread like wildfire.

[She was a predator in school! Looks innocent but pure evil.]

[Extortionists deserve to rot.]

[Abortions? Sleeping around? She’s trash.]

[Different men every night? Vile.]

No one cared about the truth. They just wanted to rage. The reposts multiplied by the minute.

Amelia scrolled through the hateful comments, a smirk curling her lips. Then, she pulled up Abigail Grayson’s contact and dialed.

The call connected after several rings. Abigail’s groggy voice crackled through. "Hello? Who is this?"

Abigail was overseas, where it was four in the morning.

Amelia knew. She didn’t care.

"Abigail, did I wake you?"

Recognition sparked. Abigail adored Amelia, so her tone instantly brightened. "Amelia! You’re back! I wanted to see you, but Grandma dragged me abroad to keep Grandpa company while he recovers."

Amelia softened her voice. "Don’t worry. We’ll catch up when you return."
###Chapter 335

"Of course!" Abigail answered. Then curiosity crept into her voice. "But Amelia, why are you calling so late? Is everything alright?"

Amelia pretended to hesitate. "Oh... it's nothing! I just bought you a souvenir during my trip, but when I got back, I realized you weren't in town. I wanted your address to mail it to you."

Warmth flooded Abigail's heart. "That's so sweet of you, Amelia! You actually remembered me while traveling!" Her voice turned bitter. "If only you were my sister—then I wouldn't have spent ten miserable days in detention! Grandma wouldn't have exiled me overseas either. I'm practically under house arrest here!"

Amelia feigned shock. "Detention? What happened, Abigail?"

The memory made Abigail's blood boil. "It's all Evelyn's fault! Ugh, why did Nathaniel have to marry some backwater peasant? She's manipulative, two-faced, the absolute worst!"

Amelia sighed dramatically. "Speaking of which... Gabrielle got arrested today. I couldn't even bail her out. I needed to talk to someone about it..."

"What? Gabrielle's in jail too?" Abigail gasped. "What's going on?"

Amelia artfully dodged direct answers at first, letting Abigail pry the story from her in pieces. She carefully curated the narrative, emphasizing only the details that painted her as the victim.

Abigail's outrage grew with each revelation. "Evelyn again? I knew she framed Gabrielle! How could my brother marry such a witch?"

Seeing her plan working, Amelia cautiously asked, "Abigail... you haven't checked any news from home recently, have you?"

"No, I've been avoiding local sites. Why? Did something happen?"

"Promise me you won't let Grandpa and Grandma see any news from back home. I'm worried it might upset them..."

"Why? Is it about our family?"

"Just... don't look it up, okay? Trust me on this."

Amelia's evasiveness had the exact effect she intended. Abigail immediately grabbed her tablet. The headlines made her blood run cold. "That shameless gold-digger! Faking identity theft for money? If people find out she's Nathaniel's wife, our family's reputation will be ruined! This is unacceptable! I'm telling Grandma right now—she'll make Nathaniel divorce that wretch!"

Amelia pretended to protest. "No, Abigail, don't! It's not good for their health—"

But Abigail was already changing clothes. "Don't worry about that! Our family won't tolerate this disgrace!" She hung up before Amelia could "stop" her.

Hearing the dial tone, Amelia smirked. Everything was falling into place perfectly.

Meanwhile at the Grayson estate, Evelyn rushed upstairs, desperate to wash off the dried, sticky soda coating her skin.

Nathaniel followed, but Evelyn slammed the door in his face.

He blocked it with one strong hand, arching an eyebrow. "I thought you wanted to learn how to get along with me. So why am I locked out?"
###Chapter 336
Evelyn blinked slowly, her fingers tightening around the doorframe. "You dragged me into the Grayson mansion and demanded my cooperation. I complied. I followed your rules, avoided stepping on your toes, and asked for nothing in return."

Her voice dropped lower. "But the game has changed now. Since we're attempting this... truce, you'll need to respect my boundaries too. The past few days have been exhausting. I need space. Either I stay in this room alone, or I'll find another—the guest room, my own apartment, anywhere but here."

Nathaniel's eyes darkened at her ultimatum. Clever little fox.

"This isn't about ownership," he countered smoothly. "Have I ever denied you anything? If you want the room, take it. I'll work in the study."

"Much obliged, Mister Grayson." A sly grin curled her lips as she tilted her chin up, gaze flicking pointedly to his hand still braced against the door.

Though every instinct urged him to stay, Nathaniel knew better than to push. With a slow exhale, he withdrew his hand—only for the door to slam shut inches from his face.

A muscle jumped in his jaw. No one had ever dared dismiss him like this.

Yet here he was, letting her.

Lucas hovered nearby, visibly torn between speaking and fleeing. Nathaniel lit a cigarette, the sharp inhale grounding him. "Report."

"Sir," Lucas ventured, "we traced the video's origin, but the IP was spoofed. Our team's decrypting the real address now. Preliminary analysis suggests the influencer orchestrated this, using the chaos to retaliate against... Madam Evelyn."

Nathaniel flicked ash off his cigarette, the ember glowing dangerously. "Find her. Now. And inform the team I'm handling this personally."

Lucas stiffened. For Nathaniel to intervene directly... Evelyn's standing eclipsed even Amelia's.

"Understood." He vanished down the hall.

Alone, Nathaniel exhaled smoke, gaze lingering on the closed door before striding toward the study.

Steam curled around Evelyn as she stepped out of the shower, the tension leaching from her shoulders. Fresh clothes, cool air—finally, clarity.

Her laptop hummed to life. Notifications from Sebastian and Seraphina blinked urgently.

[Sebastian: Boss, status?]

[At Silver Moon.]

[Seraphina: Damage control in progress, but Nathaniel's team outpaced us on suppressing the hashtags.]

[Noted.]

[Sebastian: This was coordinated. The backlash is still escalating despite the blackout. Next move?]

Evelyn's fingers flew across the keys. [Stand down on the PR front. I'll handle the digital cleanup. Sebastian—dig deeper into that public confession at Century Bank Tower. Verify if "Charlotte Bennett" exists. Cross-reference recent arrivals under that name.]

[Sebastian: On it.]

[Seraphina: Wait. You think Nathaniel wasn't behind the confession?]
###Chapter 337

Evelyn's fingers tightened around the phone.

[No, it's not him.]

Seraphina's reply came swiftly. [Fascinating! That means someone orchestrated this entire charade to mislead anyone who witnessed it. I'd bet my fortune Amelia's behind this.]

Evelyn had the same gut feeling. It wasn’t that she distrusted Nathaniel’s explanation or his investigative skills. But the odds of such a coincidence were astronomical.

Amelia just happened to return the same day Nathaniel arranged an ocean of tulips? And on that very day, some stranger staged a grand public confession at the Century Bank Tower—for a woman whose name also started with "Am"?

Worse, the confession didn’t even include the full name. Just "Am."

Who in their right mind would assume it was meant for them? It could be Amelia, Amanda, Amber, Amara—anyone. And no sane person would see a vague two-letter display and think, That’s definitely for me.

If someone went to such extravagant lengths to profess love, they’d want the world to know exactly who they were declaring it for. Omitting the name? That reeked of manipulation.

Nathaniel had stopped digging once he confirmed the confession was for a Charlotte Bennett. Understandable—Amelia had saved his life. Of course he wouldn’t suspect her.

But Evelyn wasn’t blinded by sentiment.

She’d formed her own opinion of Amelia in the short time they’d interacted. Beneath that sweet, demure facade lurked something far more calculating.

And every incident since Amelia’s return? Too convenient. Too targeted. If Evelyn was right, the real Amelia was a viper in saint’s clothing—one she’d need to watch closely.

Her thoughts shattered when the phone vibrated. The screen flashed: Grandpa.

For a split second, she froze. She didn’t have a grandfather. Then it hit her—this was Nathaniel’s phone. His grandfather was calling.

Her stomach knotted. She couldn’t answer. The man didn’t know her.

She bolted toward Nathaniel’s study, but her thumb slipped—brushing the answer icon.

The call connected.

A gravelly voice roared through the speaker.

"Nathaniel, you worthless brat! What kind of trash have you dragged into this house? Aren’t you a grown man? Consorting with a scheming, two-faced harlot? Trying to send me to an early grave, is that it?"

Evelyn’s mouth went dry.

That "trash"?

Undoubtedly her.
###Chapter 338

The old man frowned when silence greeted him. "Hello? Why is it so quiet? Can you hear me? Say something, Nathaniel!"

Evelyn Whitmore froze. What was she supposed to say? Should she admit she was the 'swine' he'd just insulted instead of his precious grandson?

Before she could decide, another voice crackled through the line—sharp and exasperated.

"Richard, you absolute fool! Who told you to call Nathaniel? Can't you just rest after taking your medicine? Give me that phone!"

A brief scuffle later, Margaret Grayson's voice came through clearly. "There's been so much news from home. What's happening?"

Evelyn hesitated, but before she could explain, Margaret cut in sternly. "Did you forget what I told you before I left? I said to treat Evelyn well! Instead, you let people slander her online? What kind of husband are you?"

Evelyn's breath caught. The words she'd been about to say died in her throat.

Margaret didn’t doubt her at all. She hadn’t even questioned the accusations—just immediately defended her.

That kind of trust was... startling.

Swallowing hard, Evelyn finally spoke. "It's me, Grandma."

Margaret gasped. "Evelyn? Oh! Wait—were you the one who answered earlier?"

"Yes."

"So you heard that old fool rambling?"

"I did."

Margaret huffed. "Don’t mind him. He’s clueless about what’s really going on."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "I’m not upset."

And she wasn’t. She’d never met Richard Grayson. His opinion meant nothing.

Margaret sighed in relief. "Good. I knew you were reasonable."

Curious, Evelyn asked, "Why didn’t you doubt me when you saw the news?"

Margaret scoffed. "Why would I? Does it make sense that the granddaughter of the Whitmores would fake an accident for money? I’m not as gullible as that old man. The news is obviously fake!"

Evelyn laughed. "You’re brilliant, Grandma."

Margaret preened. "Of course I am! Though honestly, I wish you were the type who loved money."

Evelyn blinked. "Huh?"

Margaret sighed dramatically. "Because we’re rich, and Nathaniel is even richer. If you loved money, he’d be perfect for you! I’m worried you’ll realize he’s just a cold, clueless man and leave him—and then leave us too!"

Evelyn couldn’t help but marvel.

Margaret knew her better than she’d thought.
###Chapter 339

Evelyn Whitmore adored wealth—just not the kind acquired through marriage or manipulation.

On the phone, Richard Grayson scoffed. "Please! Every woman loves money. How can someone as sharp as you believe otherwise? That girl must've bewitched you!"

Margaret exhaled sharply, her voice strained. "Stay indoors these next few days. If you must go out, be cautious. Nathaniel will handle the online chaos. I have matters to attend to—we'll speak later."

"Understood, Grandma," Evelyn replied softly.

Before the call disconnected, Margaret's furious shout pierced through. "Richard Grayson! Did you just call me naïve?"

A pained yelp followed. "Margaret—I'm an ill man! Let go!"

"Oh, so now you remember you're sick? You seemed perfectly lively a second ago!"

The line went dead.

Evelyn smirked. The elderly couple bickered like children, yet their bond was unshakable—a rarity in any world.

Just then, a video call notification flashed on her screen.

Cassandra.

Evelyn's fingers hovered. Since discovering she wasn't biologically tied to the Whitmores, she'd severed contact. No affection existed between them—only mutual indifference.

Cassandra wouldn't reach out without motive.

After a beat, Evelyn answered—but kept her camera off. The Grayson estate's opulence wasn't something she wanted flaunted.

Cassandra's face filled the screen. She turned, calling out, "Father! She picked up!"

Gregory Whitmore shoved into view, face flushed. "Where the hell have you been, Evelyn? No calls, no visits—do you even remember you have a family?"

Once, Evelyn might've feigned respect. But blood ties were a lie. All pretense vanished.

"Did you need something?" she asked coolly.

Gregory's nostrils flared. "That's your tone? You vanish after dragging our name through the mud, and now wreaths and funeral bouquets are piling at our door! Trying to kill me with shame?"

Evelyn blinked. The internet had unearthed the Whitmore address fast.

Too fast.

Someone had fueled this fire deliberately.

And if they'd exposed her ties to the Whitmores...

Her marriage to Nathaniel would be next.
###Chapter 340

Gregory's furious voice crackled through the phone. "Get back here immediately and remove all those wreaths from our doorstep! Then you'll make a public apology to the media—beg for everyone's forgiveness! I won't have our family name dragged through the mud because of you!"

Evelyn remained calm, a bitter laugh bubbling in her throat.

An elderly woman who'd known her barely two months had shown more faith in her innocence—warning her to stay indoors for safety. Yet her own father was throwing her to the wolves to save his reputation.

The contrast couldn't be more stark.

This had always been Gregory's way. Whenever trouble arose, his first instinct was to blame her—never asking for her side, never considering she might be the victim.

As a child, she'd wondered why her father wasn't like others'. She'd never experienced the paternal love her classmates wrote about in essays.

Not that Gregory was incapable of fatherly affection. The way he doted on Cassandra proved that. His golden child could do no wrong—mistakes forgiven, tantrums overlooked, always welcomed back with open arms.

But never Evelyn.

Now she understood. The coldness, the indifference—he'd always known she wasn't his blood. At best, she warranted pity.

'Then why take me from the hospital at all?' The question gnawed at her. 'Why bring me home only to exile me to the countryside?'

She'd investigate once this scandal blew over.

"Evelyn! Are you ignoring me?" Gregory's shout snapped her back. "Get here now and clean up your mess!"

"I heard you," she said coolly. "But no, I'm not coming. I'll arrange for the wreaths to be removed—your precious family won't be inconvenienced further. Now if that's all—"

"Since when do you speak to me like this?" Gregory spluttered.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Like what? I'm solving your problem. Isn't that enough?"

"You've gone completely disrespectful! Not even calling me 'Father' anymore! This is outright rebellion!"

"Let me talk to her!" Cassandra snatched the phone, her contoured face twisting in disdain.

"You're a curse, Evelyn! Everything went wrong since you left that backwater village! First my career, now this! Because of you, people are associating me with that identity scam—I'm being ridiculed online! Fix this immediately and crawl back to where you belong! Our family wants nothing to do with you!"

Evelyn's laugh was ice. "Your career? That was your own doing. And since when do you decide where I live?"
###Chapter 341

Evelyn's blood boiled. "How dare you act so high and mighty at a time like this, Cassandra? No wonder the entire internet is calling you disgraceful. You absolutely deserve it!"

"I deserve it? Then what does that make you, since you got dragged into this mess too?"

"You—"

Victoria couldn't take it anymore. She snatched the phone from her daughter and glared into the camera. "When did you become so vile? You ruined Cassandra's career! Vincent was going to mentor her—she was destined to be the next leading actress under his guidance! But you had to interfere and destroy that once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!"

"And then you spread those disgusting rumors, claiming she wasn't Gregory's daughter! You nearly tore this family apart! Thank God Gregory gave us another chance and did a second DNA test to prove Cassandra is his child! All you’ve done is stir up chaos!"

"Now you're scamming people and dragging our family name through the mud! What kind of monster are you, Evelyn?"

Evelyn smirked. "Scams? Weren’t you the ones who built your entire lives on lies? Didn’t you manipulate Vincent into backing Cassandra with deceit? The only reason you failed is because the truth came out. How is that my fault? And honestly, I could never lie as effortlessly as you two. That’s your special talent."

Victoria’s face twisted with fury. "W-What did you just say?!"

Since when did Evelyn become so sharp-tongued? She’s always been so careful around Gregory!

Cassandra snatched the phone back, her voice shrill with rage. "How dare you insult my mother, Evelyn! Who do you think you are?! Apologize right now, or I swear—"

Evelyn’s temples throbbed from Cassandra’s screeching. She rubbed her ear and tapped the red button, ending the call.

The phone buzzed again—another call. She ignored it.

She didn’t have time for the Blackwoods’ tantrums. There was work to do.

Evelyn opened her group chat with Sebastian and Seraphina.

[Sebastian, handle those wreaths sent to the Blackwoods. And find a way to stop the internet trolls from harassing them with creepy deliveries.]

No response from Sebastian. Instead, Seraphina replied.

[He’s already investigating that Charlotte Bennett situation you asked about earlier.]

Evelyn pinched the bridge of her nose. She’d forgotten about that in the heat of the argument.

[Send someone else to deal with it, Seraphina.]

[Already on it. I’ll have every florist and funeral service in the city blacklisted from accepting orders for the Blackwoods.]

[Good.]

Seraphina went offline to handle it.

Evelyn turned her attention to the internet scandal. She launched a specialized program hidden in an encrypted folder, typing in a lengthy passcode to access the deepest layers of the web—places ordinary users could never reach.
###Chapter 342

Evelyn was just about to wipe out all the online posts exposing her personal information when a message popped up from a user named 'Ethan Blackwell'.

[You're online, Luna! I need your help with something!]

Ethan Blackwell was Benjamin's online alias.

After everything that had happened recently, Evelyn had developed a strong dislike for the Rivers family. Still, she replied curtly, [What is it?]

[Ethan Blackwell: A friend of mine is being cyberbullied. Can you help me take down all the posts attacking her and leaking her private details? Everything in those posts is fabricated! I even got my friends from the AJ Alliance to hack and delete them, but some have advanced security barriers we can't crack yet.]

Evelyn raised an eyebrow in surprise. Why would Benjamin—the guy who always defended his sister—want to help me behind her back? The thought was almost laughable. Since when do pigs fly?

She remembered the look of betrayal on his face at the hospital, the way he'd pointed at her and shouted accusations. Curiosity got the better of her, and she typed, [Isn’t she your sister’s rival? I recall you cursing her out before. Since when did she become your friend?]

[Ethan Blackwell: She is my sister’s rival, but she’s not a bad person. She actually helped me once. My family misunderstood her recently and almost got her arrested. I feel terrible about it. I can’t just sit back and watch her get torn apart online. Please, Luna, can you help?]

Despite his spoiled rich-kid attitude, Benjamin had one redeeming quality—he could tell right from wrong and actually reflected on his mistakes.

Since Evelyn was going to handle the situation herself anyway, she might as well let him think he’d contributed. She typed a single word. [Fine.]

Ethan Blackwell responded instantly, overjoyed. [You’re the best! Thank you!]

Then, barely three seconds later—[Wait. How did you know the person I’m talking about is my sister’s rival? I never told you her name!]

Evelyn ignored him and got straight to work.

Another message popped up, this time with a starry-eyed emoji. [You really are one of the world’s top hackers! Luna Sterling knows everything!]

Evelyn rolled her eyes. What kind of ridiculous logic is that? He’s like some kind of fanboy.

Her fingers flew across the keyboard as she input a series of complex codes, bypassing security measures with ease. Benjamin and his friends couldn’t hack into major platforms like VeeTube due to their high-level defenses, but she slipped in effortlessly.

She pulled up the search function, ready to locate and delete every malicious post in one go. But the results came up empty. Every single post—every leak about her school, phone number, home address—had already been wiped clean.

The online storm had vanished without a trace.

Frowning, she messaged Ethan Blackwell. [Looks like the AJ Alliance already took care of it.]

[Ethan Blackwell: No way! Those posts had insane firewalls. We couldn’t touch them! Wait—what the—? They’re all gone! Who did this?!]

Evelyn’s frown deepened. If Benjamin and his crew didn’t do it… then who did?
###Chapter 343

Only a handful could breach a system with such high-level encryption.

Controlling it remotely? Nearly impossible.

Evelyn frowned. Who would take this risk for me?

[Master! Look! That ID did it!] Ethan Blackwell spotted the hacker infiltrating the edited videos circulating online—the ones framing Evelyn for identity fraud. Within seconds, every corrupted file became unplayable.

Evelyn's gaze sharpened as she recognized the hacker's ID.

Ethan, ever impulsive, fired off a message. [Who are you, mysterious savior? Why help Evelyn? Do you know her?]

No response.

Ignoring Ethan, Evelyn typed: [Long time no see, Victor.]

A beat. Then: [Likewise.]

Ethan nearly short-circuited. Victor Blackwood?! The legendary Ghostlord?!

The world’s top hacker—untouchable, enigmatic—had just acknowledged Evelyn.

Victor paid Ethan no mind. Evelyn didn’t indulge him either.

Ghostlord was a myth. Ten consecutive Global Hacking Championships. By the time Evelyn entered the scene, Victor had already retired, leaving behind an unbeaten legacy.

Yet, her skills matched his. Comparisons were inevitable.

They’d met once—at an underground hacker forum. Masks, voice changers, anonymity enforced. No faces, no names. Just mutual respect.

A fleeting connection. No personal details exchanged.

So why was Victor here now?

Evelyn hesitated. He doesn’t know I’m Evelyn. Why intervene?

Meanwhile, Ethan spiraled in the chat. [I CAN’T BELIEVE THIS! Both my idols—Luna Sterling and Ghostlord—in one place! History in the making!]

Evelyn ignored his fanboy meltdown.

[Do you know Evelyn Whitmore?] she asked Victor.

His reply was measured. [Do you?]

That single word—you—hinted at familiarity. But Evelyn couldn’t be sure.

She played it safe. [No. A client hired me to scrub those posts. How do you know her?]

Victor’s response was cryptic. [You’re very interested in her.]
###Chapter 344

Evelyn was stunned into silence. Even through the digital barrier, she could feel the raw intensity radiating from Victor Blackwood—like a predator protecting its territory. The energy was almost tangible, reminiscent of a tyrant marking what was his.

She'd clearly struck a nerve with her question. Hackers like Victor guarded their privacy fiercely, and prying into their personal lives was always a risky move.

Realizing her misstep, Evelyn quickly backtracked. [Just making conversation. Are you attending this year's Global Hacking Summit?]

[Victor Blackwood: That depends.]

She typed, [On what? Something keeping you grounded?]

[Victor Blackwood: My wife. She doesn’t like me traveling too far.]

Evelyn couldn’t help but smirk. Who knew the infamous Ghostlord was a devoted husband? [Congratulations! Funny enough, I just got married too.]

Before she could continue, Ethan Blackwell barged into the chat with his usual lack of tact. [Wait, are you two secretly married IRL? This is straight out of a rom-com! Wait—Master, you’re a woman, right? And Ghostlord’s definitely not. Unless… are you both guys?]

Evelyn rolled her eyes. Victor’s silence suggested he shared her exasperation.

Without hesitation, she booted Ethan from the server. Then, refocusing, she messaged Victor sincerely. [Regardless, I hope to see you at the summit. I’d love to pick your brain about the NuevaNova system’s vulnerabilities and EKX Enterprises’ security flaws.]

[Victor Blackwood: Maybe. If the timing works.]

With that settled, Evelyn logged off. As she closed the dark web browser, another task nagged at her—the architectural design for the Graysons’ new headquarters. She’d promised Nathaniel a draft within three days, but between everything else, she hadn’t even started.

No time like the present.

Opening her design software, she began sketching, her fingers flying across the keyboard as her vision took shape.

Meanwhile, Nathaniel exited the dark web in his study, rubbing his temples. He checked the time, then reached for his phone.

[Mind if I drop by for a bit?]

Evelyn’s phone buzzed mid-sketch. She glanced at the screen, frowned, and typed back. [Why? Something wrong?]

[Nathaniel Grayson: No. Just want to see you.]

She snorted, flipping her camera on. With a quick smirk, she snapped a selfie and sent it. [There. Stare all you want. Goodnight—don’t reply. I’m going to sleep.]

Nathaniel stared at the photo, torn between irritation and amusement. That infuriating, adorable woman.
###Chapter 345

Samuel Rivers lounged in his study at Silver Moon Estate, one hand flipping through a foreign novel while the other cradled a steaming cup of espresso.

The afternoon light streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting long shadows across the polished mahogany desk.

Oliver Kingsley, his ever-dutiful secretary, stood nearby, clearing his throat before speaking. "Sir, regarding those viral videos and posts about Evelyn Whitmore—it's obvious she's been framed. Should we issue a public statement to clear her name?"

Though Oliver couldn't fathom why Evelyn had been so dismissive toward Samuel, he couldn't deny she'd saved the elderly man by Yonder River. Without her intervention, that reckless influencer would have caused serious harm.

Samuel's sharp eyes darkened as he recalled Evelyn's defiant gaze. He took a slow sip of espresso before replying, "She's Nathaniel Grayson's woman. If anything happens, it's his problem to handle."

Oliver exhaled, realizing the truth in Samuel's words. The Grayson heir was more than capable of protecting his own. I must be overthinking this.

Setting his cup down with deliberate grace, Samuel added, "Our priority is tracing the source of that video. I want answers."

Oliver hesitated. "We've already investigated, sir, but hit a dead end. We confiscated the influencer's phone immediately—she couldn’t have backed it up. The device has been in your possession ever since, except when handed to the police for evidence."

A flicker of suspicion crossed Samuel's face. "So someone accessed it without my knowledge?"

Oliver shifted uncomfortably. "It... seems to be the only explanation."

Samuel snapped the book shut. "That phone was locked in my study drawer. Whoever took it would’ve had to break in."

Oliver frowned. "The only person who dares enter your study uninvited is Miss Amelia, but surely she wouldn’t—"

Before he could finish, the door swung open.

Amelia Rivers breezed in, balancing a delicate box of pastries. "Samuel! I brought you Fortuna’s famous custard tarts!"

A rare smile touched Samuel’s lips. Despite his aversion to sweets, he indulged her, taking a small bite.

Amelia beamed. "Well? Do you like them?"

He humored her with a nod. "Delicious. You have excellent taste."

Her smile widened, but as the sugary flavor lingered, Samuel studied her with sudden intensity.

"Amelia," he began slowly, "have you been in my study recently? Did you take anything from my drawer?"

Her eyes widened in innocent confusion. "No? Why would I?"

Samuel’s gaze sharpened. "Are you aware of the online smear campaign against Evelyn Whitmore?"

A shadow of guilt flickered across Amelia’s face before she schooled her expression. "I—I heard some gossip at lunch, but I haven’t looked into it. Why?"

Samuel’s voice turned icy. "Are you certain you don’t know anything?"

Tears welled in Amelia’s eyes. "You’re accusing me?" Her voice cracked. "Samuel, how could you doubt me?"
###Chapter 346

Nathaniel's expression softened as he noticed Evelyn's eyes welling up. His fingers brushed against her cheeks, catching the tears before they could fall. "Shh, don't cry, Evelyn. I was only asking—"

Evelyn sniffled, her voice trembling. "But the way you said it... You sounded so harsh."

With a resigned sigh, Nathaniel tried again, his tone patient. "Evelyn, that phone never left my study drawer. Yet now, there's a manipulated video circulating online, framing you and causing chaos."

"I was just following protocol—ruling out anyone in our household before letting Oliver question the staff."

"Do you understand now? As your brother, I trust you completely. Always."

Evelyn wiped her tears and nodded, her demeanor softening like a chastened child. "Okay. I get it. It makes sense you'd suspect me—I'm the only one who has full access to your study."

Nathaniel ruffled her hair, guilt gnawing at him. He should've known better. Evelyn had always been dependable.

"But it wasn't me," she insisted. "You know I'd never do something like that. Besides, I wasn't the only one in your study. Didn’t you make Benjamin finish his homework there before letting him go out?"

"Maxwell—his caretaker—and the other servants who brought him snacks... they've all been inside too. You should question them. Someone must have done this to sabotage you!"

"Benjamin?" Nathaniel's expression darkened.

Evelyn feigned surprise, then hesitated. "Nathaniel... do you think he could’ve done it? Out of anger, maybe? Because of what happened to Gabrielle?"

Nathaniel pinched the bridge of his nose, irritation flaring. "If he did, I’ll disown him. Gabrielle broke the law—she endangered you. She deserved what she got. Benjamin has no right to blame Evelyn."

Seeing his fury, Evelyn backtracked quickly. "Maybe it wasn’t him. I just... I worry."

Nathaniel exhaled, forcing calm. "You must be exhausted after today. You weren’t feeling well earlier—get some rest. I still have work to finish."

Evelyn nodded, forcing a smile. "Alright. Don’t overwork yourself. The truth will come out soon. Goodnight, Nathaniel."

The moment the study door closed behind her, her smile vanished.

Damn it. This is backfiring.

She hadn’t expected Nathaniel—usually indifferent to outsiders—to care this much about Evelyn. Worse, if he discovered she was behind the video, she’d be ruined. Benjamin was her only diversion now.

Inside the study, Nathaniel’s jaw tightened.

"Oliver," he ordered coldly. "Bring my idiot brother here. Now."

"Yes, Mr. Nathaniel."
###Chapter 347

Benjamin's fingers hovered over the keyboard, frustration bubbling inside him.

His master, Luna Sterling, had just banned him from the deep web for forty-eight hours. No matter how many times he tried to log back in, his ID remained locked.

Why? He slammed his fist against the desk.

With no other options, he switched to VeeTube and other platforms, searching for updates on the "Evelyn Whitmore Scandal."

At least the cyberbullying posts and videos had been taken down. That was something.

This should stop the situation from getting worse, he thought. But I still need to clear Evelyn's name. If I don't, she won’t be able to step outside without being recognized and harassed.

His mind drifted to Nathaniel Grayson—cold, ruthless, and entirely uninterested in anyone outside the Grayson family.

No way he’d lift a finger to help Evelyn.

Benjamin exhaled sharply, leaning back in his chair.

Then it hit him.

Nathaniel has that influencer’s phone. If I can get the unedited video, I can post it online and prove Evelyn’s innocence.

But how?

A knock at the door startled him so badly that he toppled backward, chair and all.

"Mister Benjamin?" Oliver Kingsley’s voice came from the hallway. "Mister Nathaniel requests your presence in his study."

Benjamin groaned as he picked himself up off the floor. "I already finished my homework. What does he want now?"

"I'm afraid I don't know. You'll have to ask him yourself."

Grumbling, Benjamin straightened his clothes and headed toward Nathaniel’s study.

Nothing good ever came from being summoned by Nathaniel. Either a lecture or extra assignments awaited him.

Five minutes later, he stood outside the study door, frowning.

"Lucas?" He knocked. No answer.

Pushing the door open, he found the room empty.

A slow grin spread across his face.

Perfect.

He remembered seeing Nathaniel stash the influencer’s phone in the right-hand drawer of his desk.

After a quick glance around to confirm he was alone, Benjamin darted forward and yanked the drawer open.

There it was.

His fingers closed around the phone.

Now I just need to copy the video.
###Chapter 348

Benjamin's fingers trembled as he yanked the phone from the drawer. In one fluid motion, he connected the cable to Evelyn's device and plugged the other end into Samuel's computer, his thumb drive already inserted. His movements were quick, desperate—until the file transfer was just about to begin.

A cold voice sliced through the tension.

"What do you think you're doing?"

Benjamin froze. Slowly, he lifted his gaze to meet Samuel's piercing stare.

"I—I was just looking something up," he stammered.

Samuel's eyes narrowed. "On my computer?"

Benjamin swallowed hard. "I—I forgot something earlier, and I didn’t want to lose my train of thought, so I thought—"

As he spoke, his fingers twitched, subtly disconnecting the cable and slipping the phone into his pocket.

Samuel didn’t miss it. He stepped forward, palm outstretched.

"Hand it over."

Benjamin feigned ignorance, eyes darting. "Hand what over?"

"Don’t play dumb," Samuel snapped. "Is this what you’ve been focusing on instead of your studies? Perfecting your lies?"

The mention of his neglected responsibilities made Benjamin flinch. Defeated, he pulled the phone from his pocket and surrendered it.

"Samuel, I’m sorry. I took it, but I just wanted to—"

Samuel held the phone up between them. "I don’t care what you wanted. Posting that video to slander someone who once helped our grandfather—that’s unforgivable."

Benjamin’s face paled. "What? I didn’t post anything!"

Samuel scoffed. "You really thought blurring Grandfather’s face was enough? I only testified against Evelyn because I believed she hurt Amelia. But the police cleared her. And you still went after her? Do you want the world calling the Rivers family traitors?"

"Samuel, I swear it wasn’t me!" Benjamin insisted, voice cracking.

Samuel hesitated. Benjamin’s conviction made him second-guess.

Then, a soft voice interrupted.

"Samuel? Benjamin? What’s going on?"

Amelia stood in the doorway, her pajamas rumpled, concern etched across her face.

Relief flooded Benjamin. She’d believe him.

"Amelia!" He rushed to her side. "Samuel’s accusing me of something I didn’t do! He thinks I posted that video of Evelyn!"

Amelia frowned, placing a calming hand on his shoulder before turning to Samuel. "You shouldn’t accuse him without proof."

At that moment, Oliver stepped in, his expression grim.

"Sir, we found the editing software, the original video file, and the login history for the VeeTube account on Benjamin’s computer."

Benjamin’s blood ran cold.

His computer?

That was impossible.

Samuel had set a trap—and he’d walked right into it.

But how?

His mind reeled.

This wasn’t just a mistake.

This was a setup.
###Chapter 349

Samuel's expression turned stormy. He slammed the influencer's phone onto the table with a loud crack and glared at Benjamin.

"Instead of focusing on your studies like I told you, you wasted your time on that hacker group of yours. Did you really think you could get away with this just because you think you're clever?" Samuel sneered. "If you're going to pull shady stunts, at least cover your tracks properly."

Benjamin's eyes welled up, but he stubbornly blinked back the tears. "Samuel, I did join a hacker league, but I swear—I had nothing to do with that video. Why would I hurt her?"

"You're still lying even with the evidence right in front of you?"

"I'm not lying! I didn't do it!"

Samuel had lost his patience. "Oliver, lock him in his room. No food until he confesses."

Oliver hesitated but didn't dare disobey. "Yes, Mr. Samuel."

Benjamin wiped his face roughly. "Fine! Starve me then! You're a fool, Samuel. First Evelyn, now me. One day, karma will catch up to you!"

Oliver quickly dragged him out before Samuel's temper flared further.

Amelia exhaled in quiet relief, a faint smirk curling her lips. Perfect. Samuel will never suspect me now.

Earlier, while Benjamin was being summoned and before Oliver could inspect his computer, she had slipped into his room and planted the evidence herself. Every trace Edmund had found? Her doing.

She had no choice. There was no way she'd let Samuel discover she was the one who edited and leaked that video. Benjamin was an acceptable sacrifice.

Too bad I couldn’t ruin Evelyn completely this time.

Putting on a concerned expression, she murmured, "Samuel, I’m sure Benjamin—"

Samuel cut her off with a sharp gesture. "He’s old enough to face consequences. I’ll deal with this. Go rest."

Amelia sighed. "Don’t stay up too late." She left, the picture of reluctant obedience.

Oliver returned, tense. "Mr. Samuel, Nathaniel has experts who could trace the real IP address soon. What if he thinks you leaked the video?"

Samuel arched a brow. "So what if he does?"

"We should avoid conflict with the Graysons. The feud between our families already ruined Amelia’s engagement. Escalating things will only make her suffer more. This was Benjamin’s fault."

Samuel knew Amelia still loved Nathaniel. He’d accepted that long ago. For her sake, he had to defuse this.

Rubbing his temples, he finally ordered, "Take Benjamin to Nathaniel’s office tomorrow. Explain what happened and hand over the original video. If he demands more, tell him I’ll meet him anytime."

Oliver nodded. "Understood."
###Chapter 350

The clock struck midnight when Amelia tiptoed into Benjamin's room with a plate of sandwiches.

The guards stationed outside exchanged uneasy glances but ultimately stepped aside. They knew Samuel always indulged Amelia's whims.

Even if Samuel were present, he wouldn't have stopped her.

Besides, angering Amelia meant risking Samuel's wrath. Who knew what tales she might spin?

Better safe than sorry.

Inside, Benjamin lay facedown on the bed, his muffled sobs filling the dimly lit room.

"Ben? Ben, get up before you choke yourself."

Benjamin jerked upright at Amelia's voice, hastily wiping his swollen eyes. "Amelia? What are you doing here? You should be asleep!"

"Couldn't sleep worrying about you." Amelia grabbed tissues and dabbed his tear-streaked face. "Big boys don't cry like this, you know."

The words only made Benjamin's tears flow harder. "I was framed! That phone wasn't mine! I only took it to clear Evelyn's name!"

Amelia's hand stilled mid-motion. A shadow crossed her face.

'Even Benjamin risks himself for Evelyn? What spell has that witch cast? First Nathaniel investigates for her, now this coward steals evidence!'

"Amelia?" Benjamin frowned at her strange expression. "You don't believe me either?"

She blinked, instantly softening her gaze. "Don't be silly! Of course I believe you. But you know Samuel - he trusts only hard evidence. Without proof, he won't go easy just because you're his brother." She sighed. "Tomorrow, apologize to Nathaniel. Say you weren't thinking straight. It'll calm them both down."

Benjamin recoiled. "Apologize for something I didn't do? Never! I won't take blame for this!"

Amelia's eyes welled up. "I'd never force you... It's just..." Her voice cracked. "My greatest dream is marrying Nathaniel. But after tonight... the Holdens will never accept me now. This might ruin everything!" She clutched his arm. "Please, Ben? For me?"

Tears spilled down her porcelain cheeks. The sight would melt even the coldest heart.
###Chapter 351

Benjamin's determination wavered.

In the dead of night, Amelia crept into his room with a tray of food.

The guards stationed outside hesitated, but ultimately let her pass. They knew Samuel always indulged Amelia's whims.

Even if Samuel himself were present, he wouldn't have stopped her.

Besides, they feared Samuel's temper. What if Amelia complained about them?

Letting her in seemed the safest choice.

When Amelia entered, Benjamin lay face down on the bed, sobbing uncontrollably.

"Benjamin? Benjamin, sit up. You'll choke like that."

Startled by Amelia's voice, Benjamin bolted upright, hastily wiping his tears. He turned to face her with red-rimmed eyes. "Amelia? Why are you here? Shouldn't you be asleep?"

"I couldn't sleep worrying about you." Amelia grabbed tissues and dabbed his cheeks. "Look at you. Grown men don't cry like this."

The tears kept coming despite his efforts. Amelia's words only fueled his frustration. "Amelia, I was framed! I didn't do what Samuel accused me of. I took that influencer's phone to clear Evelyn's name!"

Amelia froze, her hand halting mid-motion. A dark shadow crossed her face.

'Benjamin risked himself for Evelyn too? What's so special about her? First Nathaniel investigates the leak, now even timid Benjamin dares steal from Samuel's desk? They've all fallen for her innocent act...'

"Amelia?" Benjamin frowned at her strange expression. "You don't believe me either?"

She snapped back with a gentle smile. "Don't be silly! Of course I believe you. But you know Samuel - he trusts only evidence. Being his brother won't sway him. Without proof of your innocence, he won't go easy on you. Tomorrow, apologize to Nathaniel. Say you don't know what came over you. It'll calm them both down."

Benjamin recoiled, pushing her hand away. "Are you serious? Apologize for something I didn't do? Never! Why should I when I'm innocent?"

Amelia sighed, disappointment etching her features. "I won't force you... But you know my dream is to marry Nathaniel. Our families' past already complicates things. This video scandal will destroy any remaining goodwill with the Graysons. I might lose him forever! Benjamin, please do this for me?"

Her eyes welled up, the picture of heartbreak. Anyone would soften at her tearful plea.

Benjamin's resolve trembled. He'd do anything for Amelia, but...

"But Amelia, I think Nathaniel and Evelyn are—"

She cut him off gently, "I know Nathaniel treats Evelyn well, but she's his wife. He's just maintaining appearances for his family. He's responsible - even without feelings, he'd care for her."

"That's not what I meant," Benjamin insisted. "Nathaniel treats her differently. Better than—"

Amelia interrupted again. "It's all an act for his grandfather's sake. The kindness, the protectiveness - just maintaining the Grayson reputation. Not real feelings."

"He told me himself - he married Evelyn to please his family. Once his grandfather recovers, he'll end it and come back to me."

"And you know a man like Nathaniel wouldn't fall for someone else in a month. I know him best - it's impossible."

Benjamin found her logic sound. The Nathaniel he knew wouldn't abandon Amelia so easily.

Unable to bear her distress, he relented. "Alright. For you, I'll tell Nathaniel I posted the video and apologize tomorrow."

"Oh, Benjamin! Thank you!" Amelia hugged him tearfully. "I knew you'd understand. You're the best brother. I'll find who planted that evidence to clear your name!"

Benjamin nodded, trusting her completely.

Wiping her tears, Amelia produced the smuggled food. "Here, your favorites. I couldn't stand you going hungry. Eat."

Though appetite-less, Benjamin nibbled toast to please her.

Amelia watched her naive brother with relief, a sly smile forming. 'Perfect. With his apology, no one will suspect me. What's his punishment compared to losing Nathaniel's trust? Sorry Benjamin, but my happiness comes first.'

The next morning, Evelyn still slept when Nathaniel left his study. He knocked on their bedroom door.

Silence.

The knob turned - locked.

"One moment, Mr. Grayson," Theodore said, already fetching the spare key.
###Chapter 352

Nathaniel raised his hand to silence him. "Don't. From now on, whenever she locks that door, no one is to open it with a spare key. The only exception is if her safety is at risk."

"Yes... Mister Nathaniel," Theodore replied, slightly stunned.

This was a complete reversal from Nathaniel's usual stance. Before, he'd demand the staff unlock Evelyn's door immediately whenever she dared to lock him out. No one was permitted to lock him out of his own bedroom—let alone his wife's. Theodore had never seen Nathaniel so... compliant.

Nathaniel stopped knocking and pulled out his phone to call Evelyn. The line rang several times before she finally answered.

"What?!" Her voice was thick with sleep and irritation.

"Wake up. Breakfast is ready," Nathaniel said.

Evelyn had been up all night finishing her sketches and had only fallen asleep at dawn. Right now, sleep was her only priority.

"Not hungry. Eat without me," she muttered before hanging up.

The dial tone buzzed in Nathaniel's ear, and his expression darkened. He was used to being the one in control, but it seemed fate had sent Evelyn to humble him.

He rubbed his temples wearily before redialing. "At least open the door so I can see you."

"Didn’t I send you a selfie yesterday? Stare at that all you want," she snapped.

Nathaniel smirked. "No. That just makes me crave the real thing even more. Don’t you know that?"

The word crave jolted Evelyn awake. "Mister—is that all you think about? It’s too early for this."

Amused by her misunderstanding, Nathaniel chuckled. "Fine, fine. Go back to sleep. I won’t disturb you."

"Hmph! Next time you're asleep, I’m calling to wake you up. Let’s see how you like it," she grumbled before hanging up.

Instead of annoyance, Nathaniel felt nothing but fondness. He pocketed his phone and turned to Theodore. "No one disturbs her. When she wakes up, ask what she wants for breakfast and have it prepared."

"Yes, Mister Nathaniel. She’ll be well taken care of," Theodore assured him, still in disbelief. Is this really Nathaniel? He looks... happy. Younger, even.

Theodore had served Nathaniel long enough to know his employer rarely smiled, let alone showed emotion. Yet here he was, grinning like a fool over a two-minute phone call. Unbelievable.

Looks like the staff and I will need to treat Madam Evelyn with even more respect now. Mister Nathaniel is clearly smitten.

With Evelyn refusing to get up, Nathaniel headed downstairs to eat alone.

Lucas entered the dining room and bowed slightly. "Mister Nathaniel, we’ve located the influencer you asked about."
###Chapter 353

Nathaniel's men had taught her a harsh lesson after discovering what she did to his grandfather by the banks of Silver Peaks River.

Her streaming account had been permanently banned by the platform, cutting off her only source of income. With no other options, she fled back to her hometown.

Nathaniel remained silent, methodically finishing his breakfast.

Lucas continued his report. "The influencer admitted she was terrified her family would face repercussions since she crossed someone powerful. That’s why she’s been hiding in the countryside."

"She also claims she wasn’t the one who posted the video slandering Evelyn. Someone must have hacked her VeeTube account. She was warned never to speak about meeting Grandfather Rivers or the consequences she faced from the Grayson family."

"Samuel’s men confiscated her phone immediately. Even if she had the original footage, she wouldn’t dare use it—not after what happened."

"Sir, I don’t think she’s the one behind the video. It has to be someone else."

Nathaniel’s expression didn’t shift. He already knew the truth. Last night, he traced the video’s origin to the Rivers' estate, not the influencer. He picked up his glass of milk and took a slow sip.

Lucas hesitated before speaking again. "I had her record a statement denying involvement and explaining the truth of that day. We can release it to the media to clear Evelyn’s name."

"But it’d be more convincing if we had the original footage. People will doubt her confession, wondering if she was forced. They’ll demand proof."

"And the Rivers family…" Lucas scowled. "They’re ungrateful. Evelyn got dragged into this mess trying to help their grandfather, and now they won’t lift a finger to help her."

Nathaniel’s eyes darkened at the mention of the Rivers.

Lucas quickly added, "But Amelia once saved your life. That complicates things."

"Amelia is Amelia. The Rivers are the Rivers." Nathaniel’s voice was ice.

Lucas stiffened. The message was clear—Nathaniel wouldn’t hold back.

"What’s our next move, sir?"

Before Nathaniel could answer, Theodore hurried in. "Sir, the Rivers are here."

Lucas blinked. "The Rivers? Here?"

The two families had been enemies for decades. Even if the younger generation didn’t openly feud, unannounced visits were unheard of.

Nathaniel arched a brow. "Why?"

Theodore cleared his throat. "They say Benjamin Rivers came to apologize—to you and Evelyn. Amelia is waiting in the car."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "Let them in."

Theodore nodded and left. Moments later, Samuel’s right-hand man, Oliver, entered with Benjamin in tow.

Amelia was nowhere in sight.
###Chapter 354

Theodore announced the visitors with urgency. "Mister Nathaniel, the Rivers family has arrived."

Lucas Sinclair blinked in surprise. The Rivers never visited the Grayson estate uninvited. Their families' bitter history made such encounters rare, especially without prior notice.

Nathaniel set down his silverware. "Why are they here?"

Theodore adjusted his tie. "Their representative said they brought Benjamin to apologize properly. Miss Amelia is waiting in the car as well."

A shadow crossed Nathaniel's face. "Let them in."

Moments later, Oliver Kingsley entered with Benjamin trailing behind him. Amelia remained conspicuously absent.

Oliver bowed slightly. "Mister Grayson. Samuel asked me to return your vehicle and express his gratitude for yesterday's assistance. Without your car, he and Miss Amelia would've been stranded on Yonder Bridge for hours."

Nathaniel sliced his steak with deliberate precision. "If he's truly grateful, why send an underling instead of coming himself?"

Oliver maintained his composure despite the tension. Years serving Samuel had trained him for difficult interactions, yet Nathaniel's presence still unnerved him.

"My apologies, Mister Grayson. Samuel is currently abroad on business. Otherwise, he would've delivered his thanks personally."

The dining room fell silent except for the clink of cutlery. Nathaniel's lack of response made Oliver shift uncomfortably before nudging Benjamin forward.

"Benjamin. Now."

The usually vibrant young man hung his head. His fingers twisted together as he stepped forward, shoulders hunched like a man approaching the gallows.

"Nathaniel... I—" His voice cracked. Swallowing hard, he forced the words out. "It was me. I leaked that edited video of Evelyn. I stole that influencer's phone from Samuel's office and doctored the footage to make Evelyn look terrible. I wanted revenge for what happened to Gabrielle."

Lucas Sinclair's jaw dropped. Of all possible culprits, Benjamin was the last person he'd suspect. The boy had mischief in him, sure, but this level of calculated malice? Unthinkable.

Yet memories surfaced—Benjamin's previous clashes with Evelyn, his fierce loyalty to Gabrielle. The pieces clicked into place with unsettling clarity.

Oliver studied Nathaniel's impassive face, perplexed by his lack of reaction. "Mister Grayson, Benjamin is young and impulsive. Samuel disciplined him severely upon discovering his actions. We brought him today for you to administer whatever punishment you deem appropriate."

Nathaniel finally looked up, his gaze sharp enough to flay skin. "Tell me, Benjamin. What exactly happened at the embankment that day?"

Benjamin swallowed audibly. "Evelyn... she helped my grandfather. The influencer was harassing him because of his blindness. Evelyn intervened." His voice dropped to a whisper. "She protected him when no one else would."

The air thickened. Nathaniel's next words fell like a guillotine blade. "And you repaid that kindness with slander?"

Benjamin flinched as if struck. Across the room, Theodore gripped the doorframe, bracing for the storm about to break.
###Chapter 355

"You call this gratitude? Typical of the Rivers family—repaying kindness with betrayal!"

Benjamin clenched his fists, swallowing the bitter taste of false confession. For Amelia and Samuel, he had no choice but to bear this injustice.

"That's not true! Samuel and Amelia always taught me gratitude. I was just too stubborn to listen. I admit I wronged Evelyn."

"Nathaniel, I acted alone. My family had no part in this. Punish me however you see fit, but leave them out of it."

Nathaniel's expression darkened like a gathering storm. "You dare dictate terms to me? My wife saved your grandfather out of pure kindness, and this is how you repay her? Your entire family will—"

"Nathaniel!" Amelia's tearful voice cut through the tension as she rushed into the dining room, shielding Benjamin. Her doe eyes shimmered with unshed tears. "He's just a boy! He didn't understand what he was doing."

She turned her pleading gaze to Nathaniel. "As his sister, I can't bear this. For my sake, won't you show mercy this once?"

Nathaniel studied her tear-streaked face, his frown deepening.

Seizing his hesitation, Amelia tugged Benjamin's arm urgently. "Kneel! Show Nathaniel your remorse. He'll forgive you if he sees how sorry you are."

Benjamin stared at her in disbelief. Though every fiber of his being resisted, he began lowering himself reluctantly—

"Stand up!" A sharp female voice rang from the staircase before his knee touched the ground.

Evelyn.

All eyes turned to see her descending the stairs, stretching lazily like a cat awakening from a nap.

Nathaniel's stern expression softened instantly. 'My little hellion's finally awake.'

She reached the bottom step and shot Benjamin a sideways glance. "Men don't kneel because someone tells them to."

Benjamin straightened immediately, his usual bravado vanishing under Evelyn's piercing gaze. He hung his head. "But I... I hurt you—"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Did you really?"

His head snapped up in shock. 'Does she... know it wasn't me?'

Amelia sensed danger. Fresh tears welled as she stepped between them. "Evelyn, punish me instead! He's young and foolish. If you spare him this time, Samuel and I will make sure he learns—"

Evelyn cut her off with a humorless laugh. "Interesting. Didn't I just hear this man say Nathaniel could punish Benjamin however he wished? Now you're begging for leniency. Who exactly calls the shots in the Rivers family? Or is this how you weasel out of consequences?"

Amelia's face froze mid-sob. "He's my only brother! I'm begging you—"

Evelyn crossed her arms in an X. "Save the waterworks, Amelia. They don't work on me. Try them on someone who cares."

With deliberate casualness, she tilted her chin toward Nathaniel at the dining table. The usually composed billionaire found himself utterly speechless.
###Chapter 356

Amelia's eyes were swollen from crying. She bit her lip, forcing back another wave of tears.

"I'm sorry," she whispered. "I know I shouldn't cry, but I can't help worrying about Benjamin..."

Nathaniel's chest tightened at the sight of her distress. He gripped her trembling shoulders gently.

"Amelia, don't worry about me. I'll be fine. I'm ready to face the consequences alone. Why don't you go back with Oliver first?"

"But Benjamin—" Her voice broke, choked by another sob.

Evelyn let out a soft laugh. "Miss Amelia, I must say, I'm impressed."

Benjamin frowned, confused. What is she laughing about?

Amelia blinked, her doe eyes wide with innocence. "Evelyn... what do you mean? You're impressed by me?"

Evelyn nodded. "Absolutely. You've got a best friend who was willing to ruin me for your sake—though, unfortunately, she ended up in prison. Then your devoted little brother posted that video to frame me. And now, he's here, ready to take the fall for you."

"Everyone seems eager to walk through fire for you, just so you can stay pure and clueless. You'll have to teach me your secrets someday, Miss Amelia."

On the surface, it sounded like praise. But beneath it, the mockery was sharp.

Amelia's expression flickered. She had underestimated Evelyn. At first glance, Evelyn was just another pretty face—beautiful but shallow. Now, she realized how wrong she'd been.

She's not as simple as she looks.

Amelia widened her eyes, feigning confusion. "Evelyn, I think you've misunderstood me. I had no idea what Gabrielle and Benjamin were—"

Evelyn didn't let her finish. She turned away, striding toward the dining table where Nathaniel sat. She eyed the lavish breakfast spread and raised an eyebrow.

"Where's mine?"

Nathaniel glanced up, unimpressed. "You said you weren't hungry when I tried waking you."

Evelyn shrugged. "I wanted to sleep, but you all were making so much noise. Figured I might as well eat before going back."

As she spoke, Lucas stepped forward, pulling out the chair beside Nathaniel for her. She sat without hesitation.

Nathaniel shot her a stern look. "You refused breakfast earlier. The kitchen didn't prepare anything for you. You'll have to wait."

Evelyn pouted. "Fine."

She hadn't been hungry in bed, but now that she was up, her stomach growled in protest. Her gaze landed on the glass of milk near Nathaniel's hand. She reached for it—

Nathaniel snatched it away before she could take a sip.

Evelyn scowled. "What? I can't even have milk now?"

He said he liked me yesterday. Today, he won't even share his food. Does he even know what 'like' means?

Nathaniel read her expression easily. "You shouldn't drink milk on an empty stomach. Unless you want an upset stomach."

Evelyn groaned. "Since when did you become so fussy?"

Nathaniel's lips twitched. "Since I started caring about you."
###Chapter 357

Evelyn let out a derisive laugh.

Amelia observed the exchange between Evelyn and Nathaniel. Their behavior wasn't unusual, yet it was the most affectionate she had ever seen Nathaniel act with another woman. Her gaze darkened, fingers curling into tight fists, nails biting into her palms.

At that moment, Oliver also felt like they were intruding on something private. He quickly retrieved an item he knew would capture Nathaniel's attention.

"Mister Grayson, Mister Samuel instructed me to deliver this to you. This phone belonged to the female influencer. The original video remains unaltered. We hope this will help dispel the baseless rumors surrounding Missus Whitmore."

Nathaniel glanced at Lucas, signaling him to take the phone.

Lucas immediately accepted it from Oliver and verified the video. Confirming its authenticity, he gave Nathaniel a subtle nod.

"Mister Grayson, how do you plan to deal with Mister Benjamin?" Oliver asked cautiously.

Nathaniel didn't answer. Instead, he arched a brow at Evelyn, as if seeking her opinion—something uncharacteristic for a man who never consulted others before making decisions.

Evelyn blinked in confusion. Why is he looking at me like that? Does he want me to decide the punishment?

After a brief pause, she turned her attention to Oliver, then to the visibly distressed Benjamin.

"Leave Benjamin here. The rest of you can go," she stated firmly.

Oliver tensed at her words.

"Missus Whitmore, Mister Benjamin is still young. I hope—"

Evelyn didn’t let him finish. She scoffed, cutting him off. "Your employer’s influence is showing. If you weren’t prepared to face consequences, you shouldn’t have brought him here in the first place. Now that he’s here, he stays."

"Or were your words just empty promises? The Rivers family is at fault here. I was only trying to help one of your own. Did you really think there’d be no repercussions for your family’s actions?"

Oliver’s expression darkened, but he didn’t dare argue. He had assumed Nathaniel would go easy on Benjamin for Amelia’s sake—or that any punishment would be light. He hadn’t anticipated Evelyn being this unyielding.

Benjamin, however, refused to let Evelyn see him as weak. He squared his shoulders, lifting his chin defiantly as he stepped forward.

"Oliver, take Amelia home. I’ll stay and face whatever’s coming," he declared, resolved to accept his punishment.

Oliver hesitated. Forcibly removing Benjamin now would only escalate tensions with the Grayson family.

This is beyond my authority. I need to consult Samuel.

With that, he decided to retreat for now. He turned to Amelia. "Let’s go, Miss Amelia."

Amelia remained silent, her gaze shifting to Nathaniel, who sat at the head of the table. To her dismay, his attention was entirely fixed on Evelyn—not sparing her a single glance.

Her heart sank. After a moment of contemplation, she spoke to Oliver.

"Oliver, you must be in a hurry to return to Samuel’s office, right?"

Oliver nodded. "Yes, Miss Amelia. I’ll escort you home first, then head straight there."

"Then don’t bother with me," she said before turning to Nathaniel. "Nathaniel, could I ride with you later? My home is on the way to your office. It would be convenient."
###Chapter 358

Nathaniel's piercing gaze lingered on Amelia before shifting back to Evelyn with silent inquiry.

His unspoken question hung heavy in the air.

Evelyn's brows knitted together. 'Why does he keep looking at me like that? Is he seriously expecting me to be the villain because he can't reject his precious "savior"? This man's cunning knows no bounds. Fine, I'll play along just this once - he has been decent to me lately.'

Propping her chin on one hand, Evelyn turned lazily toward Amelia. "Miss Rivers, you seem aware your brother's assistant can't be late for work, yet conveniently forget this applies to your Nathaniel too."

The possessive phrasing made the man beside her scowl.

Amelia's eyes welled with manufactured hurt, her delicate features twisting into perfect wounded innocence. "That's not what I meant, Evelyn! Nathaniel owns the company - he sets his own hours. But Edmund is just an employee who must clock in punctually. Samuel runs a tight ship with strict penalties for tardiness."

A sardonic smile played on Evelyn's lips. "How remarkably considerate of you. No wonder people fall over themselves to help you. But you're overlooking one crucial detail - your brother sent Edmund here, which means he's technically working. Surely Samuel wouldn't punish his right-hand man after years of loyal service?"

Evelyn punctuated her point with an exaggerated yawn. "Though if Nathaniel wants to give you a ride, by all means. Your place is on his way to the office after all."

She turned impish eyes toward Nathaniel, eyebrows dancing. "Isn't that right, Mr. Grayson?"

Nathaniel ignored her question. His voice turned glacial. "Lucas, escort Miss Rivers home."

"Right away, sir."

Amelia's composure cracked. "Nathaniel, aren't you going to work today? Must you inconvenience Lucas?" Her transparent attempt at false consideration fooled no one.

Nathaniel remained unmoved, gesturing toward Evelyn. "The brat's getting jealous. Best not provoke her."

Evelyn nearly choked. 'Excuse me? Jealous? This is emotional blackmail at its finest!'

Amelia froze, genuine hurt flashing across her features. Before she could protest, Lucas smoothly intervened. "This way, Miss Rivers. Your carriage awaits."

Forced into retreat, Amelia conjured a brittle smile. "Of course. My apologies for troubling you, Nathaniel." The unspoken resentment in her eyes betrayed her gracious words.

Nathaniel offered only a curt nod, already dismissing her presence.

Amelia's jaw clenched before pasting on another smile for Evelyn. "Until next time, Evelyn."

"Don't let the door hit you on the way out," Evelyn chirped.

Amelia stormed off, her furious footsteps echoing through the hall, with Oliver trailing helplessly behind.
###Chapter 359

Benjamin remained in the dining room, bracing himself for Evelyn and Nathaniel's verdict.

A maid placed a steaming breakfast plate before Evelyn, whose hunger made her dive in immediately. As she devoured the bacon and eggs, she felt an intense gaze burning into her. It wasn't just a look—it felt like invisible silk threads wrapping around her, tightening with each passing second.

Her brows furrowed as she glanced up at Nathaniel. "Sir, shouldn't you be heading to the office by now?"

Nathaniel feigned irritation. "That eager to get rid of me?"

Evelyn shook her head. "Not at all. It's just—you've finished eating, and your team must be waiting. No point lingering here."

His lips thinned. "I'm in no hurry."

She suppressed an eye roll. "Fine, but could you stop staring? It's distracting."

Nathaniel arched a brow. "After you abandoned me in the study last night, don't I deserve to look my fill?"

Evelyn scoffed playfully. "History blames the concubine when emperors neglect their duties. I refuse to be your scapegoat when your staff gossips about your tardiness."

"Ridiculous!" Nathaniel actually chuckled, amused by her creativity. "No one would dare."

"They'll whisper behind your back," she countered. "And trust me, I won't be the heroine of those stories."

He pinched her cheek, torn between affection and exasperation. "Alright, to spare your reputation, I'll go. But tonight," his voice dropped, "you'll answer for this rebellion."

Evelyn merely smirked.

Rising, Nathaniel braced a hand on her chair and leaned down, his eyes demanding a farewell kiss. Evelyn hesitated—Benjamin's presence made her self-conscious. Quick-thinking, she speared a slice of ham and popped it into Nathaniel's mouth instead.

Surprise flickered across his face. Though displeased, he accepted the offering, mollified by her initiative. "Behave while I'm gone," he murmured, tousling her hair before accepting his coat from the maid and striding out.

Left alone, Evelyn sipped her milk, cheeks flaming. Across the room, Benjamin gaped.

The Nathaniel he knew was ice incarnate—calculated, detached. This version? Warm, playful, utterly besotted. The transformation was staggering.

A chill ran down Benjamin's spine. If this continued, Amelia would lose Nathaniel forever. The thought of his sister's reaction terrified him.

Finishing her meal, Evelyn approached. Benjamin stood his ground. "Do your worst. I'm ready."
###Chapter 360

Evelyn didn't even glance at Benjamin. She simply stretched, walked right past him, and headed upstairs. Only one thought occupied her mind—getting back to sleep.

Benjamin stood frozen in shock. He hurried after her with a scowl. "Hey! Evelyn! Aren't you going to punish me? Hello?"

She kept climbing the stairs without acknowledging him.

Frustration bubbled up inside Benjamin. Being ignored wasn't something he tolerated. He moved to follow her upstairs when Theodore intercepted him firmly. "Mr. Rivers, Madam wishes to rest now. Perhaps you could wait until she wakes before requesting punishment?"

Benjamin frowned. "Why's she so exhausted? It's practically noon already!"

Theodore's polite demeanor hardened. He didn't appreciate anyone from the Rivers family speaking disrespectfully about his employer. "Regardless, you will not disturb Madam. You'll wait quietly until she chooses to come down."

He signaled the staff to monitor Benjamin, ensuring no disturbances would reach Evelyn.

Left with no options, Benjamin complied. He wasn't in his own home, and he'd been raised to respect household rules elsewhere.

Watching Evelyn disappear upstairs, he slumped onto the sofa and pulled out his phone. Scrolling through news feeds, he found no trace of the scandalous video—a relief.

Lucas worked efficiently. Though tasked with escorting Amelia home by Nathaniel, he'd simultaneously directed his team to release both the original and debunking videos online. Media outlets were promptly notified, creating instant buzz.

Public opinion shifted dramatically.

Netizens who'd participated in Evelyn's cyberbullying now felt profound shame. Some issued public apologies. Others deleted hateful comments. A surprising number became instant fans.

The incident turned into an unexpected boon. Evelyn's striking beauty and compassionate nature attracted loyal followers. When details emerged about her humble origins—how she'd fought her way from rural poverty to attend the city's most prestigious school—admiration skyrocketed. Her previous discretion about these struggles only intensified public fascination.

Had Evelyn possessed a VeeTube account, she'd have gained a million followers overnight. For Benjamin, the positive outcome brought immense relief.

Evelyn finally awoke late that afternoon.

She freshened up, changed clothes, and booted up her computer. Inspiration struck—she wanted to refine the design sketches she'd poured her soul into the previous night.

Finalizing the drawings after thorough review, she emailed them to Nathaniel from her work account, seeking his feedback. Now came the waiting game.

Originally a three-day project, she'd completed it in one marathon session. Mentally drained, she decided some fresh air might help. Shutting down her computer, she headed downstairs.

Benjamin was engrossed in a mobile game when Evelyn descended.

Theodore immediately approached. "Good afternoon, Madam. I allowed you to sleep through lunch. What would you like to eat? The kitchen can prepare anything immediately."

Evelyn noted Theodore's newfound respect with surprise.

She'd always considered him more decent than other staff members—unlike those who pretended respect while gossiping behind her back. Yet previously, Theodore had treated her merely as a guest, not the lady of the house.
###Chapter 361

It all started with Nathaniel's sudden shift in behavior toward her.

Evelyn dismissed the concern with a wave. "Don't worry about it. I'll grab lunch myself."

Theodore hesitated. "Where are you headed, ma'am? Should I arrange for the driver?"

She slipped on her shoes by the entrance. "No need. I could use the fresh air."

He still looked uneasy. "Did you bring your phone? Is it charged? Mister Nathaniel will want to reach you if—"

The memory of Nathaniel's frantic search after her disappearance still haunted him. The man had nearly torn the city apart.

Evelyn cut him off. "Relax, I won't lose it. Go back to your work, Theodore."

With a reluctant bow, he conceded. "Be careful, ma'am."

She stepped outside, humming softly.

Benjamin had overheard the exchange. The moment Evelyn left, he abandoned his game and jogged after her.

Once past the estate gates, he caught up. "Hey, Evelyn. Where are you going?"

She ignored him, strolling toward the bus stop.

Annoyed, he blocked her path. "I asked you a question. Are you ignoring me on purpose?"

Evelyn arched a brow. "Since when do I report to you?"

His confidence wavered under her sharp gaze. "I just—you said you'd deal with me. How long are you going to keep this up?"

She sighed. "What's there to deal with? You didn't do it."

Benjamin blinked. "You... believe me? Then why make me stay?"

She rolled her eyes. "Would you rather be stuck at home under surveillance?"

Realization hit him. If he'd gone back, his brother's men would've hounded him day and night.

Evelyn walked past him, and this time, he followed quietly. "Why trust me? After everything?"

She smirked. "Oh, I don't trust you. But you're not smart enough to pull off those articles."

His face darkened. "Are you calling me stupid?"

She glanced back, amused. "I am curious, though. Why take the blame for something you didn't do?"
###Chapter 362

Benjamin scratched his head. "Well, my sister said the feud between the Rivers and the Graysons will escalate if no one steps up to take the blame. If that happens, her relationship with Nathaniel might suffer..." His voice trailed off as he realized how awkward it was to mention Amelia and Nathaniel in front of Evelyn.

Evelyn merely smirked, unfazed. "Would you jump off a cliff if your dear sister asked you to?"

Benjamin didn't hesitate. "Absolutely!"

Evelyn gave him a slow clap. "What a devoted little brother."

Though her tone dripped with sarcastic admiration, Benjamin sensed something off. He hurried after her, frowning. "What's that supposed to mean? Amelia's always looked out for me. If she's in trouble, I can't just abandon her! Her life matters more than mine!"

Evelyn only smiled, silent.

Amelia was a master manipulator, twisting her brother's loyalty like putty. If she were half as virtuous as Benjamin believed, she wouldn't have sent her underage brother to confess to crimes he didn't commit—just to shield herself.

The truth was obvious. The Rivers had no reason to take the fall unless Amelia was hiding something. She was the real culprit, pulling strings from the shadows while painting herself as the victim.

Her talent for deception was chilling. She made people want to sacrifice themselves for her, all while maintaining her facade of innocence.

Evelyn had seen through it.

Sebastian's investigation confirmed it.

Out of 1,203 Charlotte Bennetts in the city, none had returned the day of the grand LED confession at Silver Peaks Shore. The payment for the Century Bank Tower ad was another red flag—paid in cash by a masked woman.

That same night, surveillance caught Amelia in a café across the street, watching the display with a smirk that shattered her saintly image.

The confession was her doing. A calculated move to manipulate public perception, making it seem Nathaniel was obsessed with her.

She'd barely been back a week, yet chaos followed.

Evelyn tightened her grip on her phone.

Amelia wasn't just dangerous.

She was prepared.
###Chapter 363

A bus pulled up just as Evelyn reached the stop. She blinked, shook off her thoughts, and quickened her pace to board.

The window seat was empty. She claimed it without hesitation.

Benjamin sprinted after her, nearly missing the doors. His first time on public transport showed when he froze at the entrance.

"Scan your pass or pay, kid," the driver barked.

Flushing, Benjamin fumbled with his phone. The QR code took three attempts before the payment went through.

He slumped into the seat beside Evelyn, scowling.

She ignored him, humming as buildings blurred past the glass.

Benjamin studied her profile. "You're Nathaniel's wife now," he blurted. "Why ride this junk?"

Evelyn stretched lazily. "What's wrong with it? Seats are comfy. AC works."

He glanced around. The bus was half-empty, floors surprisingly clean.

"Private cars exist for a reason," he huffed. "Door-to-door service. No waiting. No weird smells."

Evelyn turned slowly. "I prefer not having chauffeurs track my every move. This suits me fine." Her eyes narrowed. "Our worlds don't overlap, Benjamin. Next stop's your cue to exit."

"Try and stop me," he challenged, crossing his arms.

"Suit yourself." She resumed window-gazing.

Silence lasted precisely two minutes.

"Listen," Benjamin leaned in. "If you admit we're from different planets, you must see it with Nathaniel too."

Evelyn nodded. "Crystal clear."

"Then quit while you're ahead!" His voice rose. "Amelia and him? Perfect match. Status. Education. Background. Even their damn childhood vacations aligned!"

A smirk tugged Evelyn's lips. "Ah. This is about your sister."

"Damn right! They're endgame. You? Some country girl who thinks bus rides are fun." His nose wrinkled. "He'll get bored eventually."

Evelyn pictured Nathaniel's sharp jawline, the way his eyes softened just for her. "Funny. He never complained about how I commute." She tilted her head. "Unlike certain trust-fund babies, he doesn't equate wealth with worth."

Benjamin stiffened. "That's not—"

"Save it." She waved him off. "Your elitism's showing."

He glowered. "Answer me this—do you even like him?"

Evelyn's breath hitched. Heat flooded her cheeks. "Who said anything about feelings?"

The bus lurched around a corner. Neither noticed their shoulders brushing.
###Chapter 364

Benjamin crossed his arms, smirking with arrogance. "Even if you do like him, it's pointless. You two won't last long anyway. Take my advice—walk away now before you get your heart broken later."

The bus screeched to a halt at the station just as he finished speaking.

Evelyn stood up, brushed past him without so much as a glance, and stepped off the bus.

Benjamin blinked, then scrambled after her, irritation sharpening his voice. "Hey! Evelyn! Did you even hear what I said? Evelyn!"

She ignored his nagging completely, pushing open the door of a nearby café. Undeterred, Benjamin followed, still ranting. Moments later, Evelyn emerged with an iced latte in hand and strode purposefully into the shopping mall ahead.

Benjamin trailed behind, relentless. He was determined to convince her to back off—to leave Nathaniel free for his sister. Evelyn, however, acted as if he didn’t exist, sipping her drink while browsing store after store. She moved from the ground floor all the way up, picking up small items here and there.

By the time they reached the top floor, Benjamin was hunched over, panting. "Wait up! How are you not tired? Girls always complain in gym class, but shopping for hours? No problem?"

Evelyn wasn’t even winded. She arched a brow at him. "Already worn out? Then stop following me and go do something useful."

Benjamin straightened, indignant. "What’s wrong with me tagging along? A girl like you shouldn’t be wandering around alone. You should be thanking me for the free protection!"

Evelyn gave him a slow, skeptical once-over. "You? Protect me?"

His pride stung, Benjamin flexed his arms, rolling up his sleeves to show off what little muscle he had. "Got a problem with that? I’m plenty strong!"

Evelyn pressed her lips together, amusement flickering in her eyes before she turned away.

Benjamin bristled, ready to prove himself—until a chorus of high-pitched voices cut through the air.

"Benjamin!"

He froze, turning toward the sound. Three girls stood by the entrance of an escape room, eyes wide with excitement.

The one in the middle—long hair, flowing skirt—bounced forward, cheeks flushed. "It is you! We thought we were seeing things!"

Benjamin barely spared them a glance. "Oh. Hey."

They were classmates, but he couldn’t recall their names.

The girl’s gaze darted to Evelyn, who stood a few feet away, sipping her latte. Suspicion darkened her expression. "Benjamin… is she your girlfriend?"

Evelyn nearly choked on her drink.

Benjamin’s face twisted in horror. "What? No!"

The girl relaxed, then studied Evelyn again, tilting her head. "Oh! Is she your sister? You kind of look alike."

Benjamin recoiled. "Are you blind? We look nothing alike!"

The girl flinched, eyes watering.

Benjamin didn’t even notice. He was too busy scowling at the absurdity of the comparison.
###Chapter 365

Evelyn thought Benjamin's good looks couldn't compensate for his lack of tact. Even if he wasn't interested in the girl, his rude behavior was unacceptable.

Seeing the long-haired girl's eyes welling up, Evelyn's protective instincts kicked in. "Don't mind him. Manners aren't exactly his strong suit. His issue's with me, not you."

Emily Sinclair blinked back tears, studying Evelyn with newfound admiration. "Hi! Are you Benjamin's sister?"

Evelyn recognized the telltale signs of a schoolgirl crush instantly. A simple 'no' would only fuel misunderstandings about her relationship with Benjamin.

"Sort of," she hedged.

Emily's posture relaxed visibly. "I'm Emily Sinclair, Benjamin's classmate. Sorry I didn't realize earlier - you look about our age. Are you his older or younger sister?"

Evelyn waved it off. "No worries. Out shopping with friends?"

Emily nodded eagerly. "We wanted to try the escape room after, but got spooked and ran out halfway."

Evelyn elbowed Benjamin sharply. "Perfect chance to be chivalrous. Escort your classmates through it."

Benjamin's nose wrinkled in distaste. He avoided girls at school - too many giggles and hair-flipping for his liking.

"No way. Waste of time," he scoffed.

"Scared?" The taunt came from across the hallway, not from Evelyn or the girls.

All heads turned. Benjamin's expression darkened when he spotted Zachary Montgomery approaching with his usual entourage.

The girls gasped in unison. "It's Zachary's group!"

Evelyn recognized them instantly - the same boys who'd ambushed Benjamin at Silver Moon Estate.

Zachary swaggered forward, lip curled. "Didn't peg you for a coward, Rivers. First failing classes, now too chicken for an escape room?"

Benjamin's jaw clenched. "Not scared. Just hate lame offline games."

Zachary snorted. "Prove it then." His friends erupted in mocking laughter.

Pride stung, Benjamin bit out, "Fine! Let's play!"

Emily brightened immediately. Turning to Evelyn, she asked, "Will you join our team?"

Before Evelyn could decline, Zachary's gaze sharpened on her. "Who's she?" He remembered this woman defending Benjamin before - never a good sign.

Emily answered for her. "Benjamin's sister!"

Zachary barked a laugh. "I've met Amelia. This one's definitely not family. Did you knock her up or something?"

Benjamin saw red. "Amelia's my second sister! This is Celeste! Got a problem with that?"

Evelyn nearly choked.

Zachary's smirk faltered. "Thought your sister Celeste went missing years ago. When'd you find her? Nobody mentioned this."
###Chapter 366

Benjamin tilted his chin up, arching a brow. "Did you really think the Rivers family would spill our secrets to outsiders? Know your place."

Zachary Montgomery glared, irritation flashing in his eyes. "Fine. I'll play along—she's your sister, then. Last time you beat me in that mobile game, it was pure luck. Let's see if you can handle an escape room without wetting yourself."

A smirk curled Benjamin's lips. "We'll see who's laughing by the end."

"Bring it," Zachary shot back before strutting away with his entourage, disappearing into the dimly lit corridor of the escape room venue.

Benjamin turned to Evelyn, adrenaline pumping through him. "Come on. Let's wipe that smug look off his face."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "I never agreed to this."

His expression darkened as he grabbed her wrist. "You're bailing now? Not happening."

Evelyn scoffed. Bailing? I was never in this ridiculous competition to begin with.

By the time Emily Sinclair and her friends caught up, the group had already gathered inside. Reluctantly, Evelyn followed, though her patience was thinning.

Zachary's group had already picked the most notorious theme—Asylum of Shadows. He smirked at Benjamin. "Unless you're too scared?"

Benjamin scoffed. "Please. I eat nightmares for breakfast."

Emily and her friends paled, huddling closer to Benjamin. "C-Can we stay with you?"

"Sure," he said, shrugging. Five against five—fair enough.

Zachary barked out a laugh. "You sure about that, ladies? Benjamin might just leave you behind when the first ghost pops out."

"Shut it, Zachary," Benjamin snapped. "Unlike you, I don't scream for my mommy."

Zachary's smirk faltered before he turned to the receptionist, whispering something that made her nod with a sly grin.

Just as they were about to enter, Emily frowned. "Wait—where's Evelyn?"

Benjamin whirled around. Damn it. She slipped away.

Zachary's grin widened. "Oh? Did your big sister abandon you? Can't handle it alone?"

Jaw tight, Benjamin shot back, "Worry about yourself. I don't need a babysitter."

He scanned the room one last time, but Evelyn was gone. A flicker of unease passed through him, but there was no backing out now.

Turning to Emily and the others, he forced confidence into his voice. "Relax. It's all fake. Stick close, and don't let them get in your head."

Emily's nerves settled slightly at his reassurance. She nodded, determination sparking in her eyes. "Let's do this."

The heavy doors creaked open, swallowing them into the darkness.
###Chapter 367

The moment they crossed the threshold into the 'Asylum of Shadows,' an unnatural chill crawled up their spines.

Benjamin led the three trembling girls inside, their footsteps echoing through the sterile corridors. Zachary's group had already disappeared ahead, their laughter fading into the distance.

Suddenly, two figures materialized from the flickering shadows.

Male patients with hollow eyes and torn hospital gowns lurched toward them, their movements unnaturally jerky. Instead of targeting Zachary's group, the specters zeroed in on Benjamin's party.

The girls' screams pierced the air as they clung to Benjamin like lifelines. Their grip was so tight he couldn't move even if he tried.

From down the hall, Zachary's triumphant voice rang out. "Looks like we're winning, Rivers! Try not to scream like a baby!"

Benjamin gritted his teeth. Before he could react, the ghosts began circling them, whispering nonsensical medical terms. With a sudden burst of adrenaline, Benjamin shoved both actors aside.

Just as they thought they'd escaped, a new horror emerged.

Dozens of zombies shambled into view, their rotting flesh barely contained by stained hospital scrubs. Even Benjamin felt his pulse skyrocket - the special effects were terrifyingly realistic.

"Listen carefully," Benjamin whispered urgently. "Close your eyes, hold hands, and follow my voice."

Emily, his longtime crush, squeezed his arm. "We trust you," she said, rallying her friends. "Let's move!"

Their desperate sprint brought them face-to-face with Zachary's smug expression. The race for clues had become deadly serious.

Benjamin spotted the solution first. "There! Open that panel!" he instructed the girls.

The door creaked open to reveal absolute darkness.

Then came the giggling.

Seven nurses in blood-spattered uniforms emerged, hypodermic needles glinting in the dim light. "Patients mustn't wander," they chorused. "Time for your medicine!"

Zachary's group watched from a safe distance, laughing at Benjamin's predicament. Their amusement died when a nurse materialized behind Zachary, pressing a scalpel to his throat.

"What the hell?" Zachary spat. "I paid you to target them! You want your bonus or not?"

The nurse's eyes widened in recognition. She released Zachary and lunged at Benjamin with terrifying speed.

The blade flashed.

Crimson bloomed across Benjamin's shirt as he collapsed. The nurse raised her weapon again for the killing blow.

Emily's scream shattered the tension. "She's really stabbing him!"

Benjamin's body convulsed once before going frighteningly still. The pool of blood spreading beneath him looked far too real to be special effects.
###Chapter 368

The blood-streaked nurse kept plunging the knife into Benjamin's motionless body. Zachary finally snapped out of his daze, realizing the gravity of the situation.

"Hey! Stop that right now!"

At his shout, the nurse froze. She lifted her crimson-stained face, her lips twisting into a grotesque half-smile.

"You told me to stop?" Her voice dripped with mock innocence. "Wasn't this exactly what you asked for? You specifically requested we avoid your group and target him. 'Scare him to death,' weren't those your exact words?"

Emily and the others gasped, their fear momentarily eclipsed by fury. Their glares burned into Zachary.

"You're despicable, Zachary!"

"How could you do this?!"

"Benjamin died because of you!"

Cornered and humiliated, Zachary clenched his jaw. "I said scare him, not murder him!"

The nurse tilted her head like a broken doll. "Oops. My mistake. Too late now!"

Blind with rage, Zachary lunged forward and grabbed Benjamin's lifeless form. He shook him violently. "Wake up! Benjamin! Open your eyes!"

No response. Zachary's hands came away soaked in red. His face drained of color.

"You monster!" He ripped the bloodied mask off the nurse's face—only to recoil in horror.

Beneath the mask was a featureless expanse of pale skin, save for a pair of smirking lips.

"Ghost! It's a ghost!" Zachary scrambled backward, his legs giving out.

The nurse advanced, her smile widening unnaturally. "Who are you calling a ghost?"

"Stay back! I never wronged you!"

She raised the knife, her voice icy. "You accused me of killing him. Why not join him, then? Fair's fair."

"Zachary!" His friends tried to rush to his aid but found themselves blocked by a wall of identical nurses. Whether human or spectral, they didn't know—but the circle tightened relentlessly.

Terror paralyzed them.

"Help! There are real ghosts here!"

"Someone call the police! They killed him!"

"Let us out! We quit!"

Only their panicked cries echoed in the sealed room.

As the blade descended, Zachary squeezed his eyes shut. "Mom! Help me—"

A burst of laughter cut through the tension.

The knife never landed. The nurse twirled it expertly before tucking it away. Zachary blinked, stunned, then whipped his head toward the sound.

Across the room, Benjamin sat up, grinning. "Save the dramatics, Zachary. Mommy's not coming."

"You—you're alive?!"

Emily gasped, tears streaming as she sprinted to Benjamin. "Thank God! I thought you were—"

Benjamin pushed her off with a cold shrug. He stood, arms crossed, smirking at Zachary. "You'd die before me."

The group gaped. How? The nurse had stabbed him repeatedly!

Their confusion deepened as the nurse peeled off another mask—revealing Evelyn beneath.

Evelyn pressed the knife's tip. The blade retracted, spraying fake blood. She tossed the prop aside, boredom etched on her face.

"A fake?!" Zachary's face burned with humiliation. "You played me!"
###Chapter 369

The three girls exhaled in relief. "Benjamin's sister was pranking us the whole time! It was all staged!"

Benjamin moved to shield Evelyn, concerned Zachary might lash out. "Tch! You said I'd wet myself from fear, yet you're the one screaming for mommy!"

Zachary clenched his jaw and stood. "How dare you team up to trick me!"

Benjamin smirked confidently. "Weren't you the one who tried rigging the game first? You paid double to bribe the actors against us while your group got an easy ride! Don't whine when your schemes backfire!"

"That doesn't count! None of them followed through!" Zachary pointed accusingly at Evelyn and the actors, his ears turning red.

Benjamin's face twisted in disgust. "I never realized you were this shameless."

"You—" Zachary gritted his teeth, speechless.

Earlier, Evelyn had overheard Zachary bribing staff during her bathroom break. Disgusted, she'd tripled his offer to join as an actress instead.

Money-hungry people were fickle—they'd betray anyone for higher pay.

While Benjamin searched for clues, he'd received a text from Evelyn using Nathaniel's number: [Play dead.]

At first confused, he understood when the nurse's "attacks" caused no pain. He immediately played along.

Exiting the escape room, Zachary blocked Benjamin's path. "Not bad in there! Got the guts for a rematch?"

Benjamin scoffed. "Why would I entertain a cheater? Move!"

Undeterred, Zachary pointed nearby. "There's a pool. Crystal clear water, no way to cheat. Or are you scared?"

"Not interested."

"Can't swim, can you?"

Fresh from humiliating Zachary earlier, Benjamin wasn't rising to the bait. "My swimming skills are none of your damn business!" He grabbed Evelyn's wrist and walked off.

"Hey! Benjamin Rivers!" Zachary chased after them.

Evelyn's gaze flickered between the pursuer and Benjamin. "Why's he so obsessed with challenging you? Could he be... into you?"

Benjamin nearly tripped. "Hell no! He likes Emily, but she prefers my company. Hence the petty tantrums."

Evelyn glanced back. Zachary was calling after Benjamin while stealing glances at Emily, who only had eyes for Benjamin.

'Ah, the classic love triangle.' Zachary's bruised ego demanded redemption in front of his crush.

"Stop right there, Luna Whitmore!" Zachary shouted when Benjamin ignored him.

Nearby on the mall's escalator, the manager fawned over Samuel Rivers, president of Rivera Group. "Your event will be flawless, Mr. Samuel!"

Samuel gave a curt nod. "See that it is."

"Luna Rivers! I said STOP!" The name made Samuel's icy gaze snap toward the commotion.

His secretary Oliver gasped. "Sir, it's Benjamin with his classmates."

Samuel's expression darkened as he strode over.

Spotting him, Benjamin froze. "Samuel? What are you—"

Samuel cut him off, scanning the group with glacial intensity. "Which one of you is Luna Rivers?"
###Chapter 370

The tension in the air was palpable.

Benjamin wasn't the only one shaken by Samuel's unexpected arrival. The entire group of students behind him froze, their nervous energy radiating like static electricity.

For the girls, this was their first encounter with Benjamin's older brother. None had anticipated he'd be so strikingly handsome - his mature aura making Benjamin seem like a boy in comparison. They stood mesmerized, barely breathing under his commanding presence.

Zachary and his crew fell silent immediately. While they had no problem provoking Benjamin, facing Samuel Rivers was an entirely different matter. The Rivers family dominated the city's power structure, their influence stretching nationwide. None of their families could even dream of matching that status.

Samuel's piercing gaze darkened when no one answered his question. His frown deepened as he repeated, "Which one of you is Celeste Rivers?"

The silence stretched uncomfortably long.

Benjamin was drowning in guilt, sweat beading on his forehead. He knew better than anyone how sacred his missing sister's memory was to Samuel. The consequences of someone else using that name would be catastrophic.

Zachary noticed Benjamin's guilty expression and smirked. Seeing an opportunity, he nudged Evelyn beside him. "Hey, Celeste! Your brother's talking to you. Why so quiet?"

Emily, who had a crush on Benjamin, sensed something amiss. She stepped forward politely. "Excuse me, sir. Isn't Celeste your younger sister? Why do you sound like you don't know her? She's right there next to Benjamin."

"Next to him?" Samuel's eyebrow arched as his attention snapped to Evelyn standing beside Benjamin.

His pupils constricted sharply. The woman he'd initially dismissed now held his full attention. The warmth in his eyes vanished instantly, replaced by icy fury. "You called yourself Celeste?"

Evelyn remained expressionless, opening her mouth to explain. "I-"

Samuel cut her off with a sharp gesture. "I don't care how you wormed your way into the Graysons' circle," he said coldly, "but using my family name to elevate yourself? That I won't tolerate. If I ever hear you pretending to be my sister again, you'll regret it."

His threat hung heavy in the air.

Benjamin knew Samuel never made idle threats. Despite his fear, he couldn't let Evelyn take the fall for his lie. Gritting his teeth, he stepped between them. "It's not her fault, Samuel. She never pretended to be Celeste. I told everyone her name was Celeste because-"

The slap came without warning, cracking through the tense silence.

Benjamin staggered, hand flying to his stinging cheek. His ears rang, eyes burning with unshed tears. "I swear, she didn't do anything wrong. It was me..."

"Then you're even more of a fool," Samuel snarled, his usual composure shattered. "Letting some social climber use our sister's name? What were you thinking?"

He turned his furious gaze back to Evelyn, pointing accusingly. "Do you really think you're worthy of that name?"
###Chapter 371

Evelyn was utterly speechless. What did I do? I didn't provoke anyone! Why am I suddenly being targeted like this?

"Don't point at her."

A deep, commanding voice cut through the tension. Though spoken at a normal volume, the words carried an undeniable weight that sent a shiver down everyone's spines. All eyes turned toward the source.

Standing a short distance away was a strikingly tall man. His sharp features were accentuated by perfectly styled hair, every angle of his face sculpted to perfection. He moved with the effortless grace of a man who commanded respect, his expression unreadable yet undeniably intimidating.

Nathaniel Grayson strode forward, his presence alone enough to make the air feel heavier.

Samuel Rivers narrowed his eyes, hostility flashing in his gaze.

Benjamin Rivers froze, baffled by Nathaniel's sudden appearance.

The onlookers held their breath, the tension between the two men thickening to an unbearable degree. No one dared speak.

Evelyn blinked in surprise. She hadn't expected him to show up. In the absence of her usual allies, his arrival was oddly comforting. She tilted her head up to meet his gaze. "What are you doing here?"

Nathaniel's cold eyes softened slightly as they settled on her. "It's raining. I came to bring you an umbrella."

Lucas Sinclair, trailing behind him, held up a sleek black umbrella.

Is it raining? Evelyn glanced around, but the mall's enclosed structure offered no view of the outside.

Nathaniel's large hand cupped her chin, tilting her face up at just the right angle. His fingers brushed lightly over her cheek. "Had enough fun for one afternoon?"

Fun? I just got yelled at for no reason!

Evelyn stifled a yawn. "I'm exhausted. Let's go home."

Nathaniel feigned disapproval, his brow furrowing. "You never get tired when you're avoiding me. Would you rather be scolded by strangers than spend time with me?" His tone was stern, yet laced with something dangerously close to affection. "Next time someone gives you trouble, call me."

She barely resisted rolling her eyes. He was treating her like a child.

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "You showed up without me calling, didn't you?"

"You wouldn't have called at all if I didn't." Nathaniel ruffled her hair, his voice dropping to a low, chastising murmur.

Evelyn suppressed a groan. I can't deal with this level of possessiveness.

Nathaniel didn’t push further. Instead, he pulled her close, tucking her securely against his side. Then, his gaze hardened as it locked onto Samuel.

"I expect better from the Rivers family," Nathaniel said, his voice icy. "After everything Evelyn has done for your father, this is how you repay her? By pointing fingers?"

Samuel's irritation faded into a cool, practiced smile. "Funny you should mention gratitude, Nathaniel. My sister Amelia saved your life. Yet here you are, cozying up to another woman right in front of me. Tell me—does Amelia still mean anything to you? Or have you forgotten what she sacrificed for you?"
###Chapter 372

Nathaniel's icy demeanor darkened further. "I've never forgotten Amelia's kindness, and I will repay it for you."

"Is that so?" Samuel smirked, casting a mocking glance at Evelyn.

Nathaniel had nothing more to say on the matter. His politeness toward the Rivers family stemmed solely from Amelia having saved him in the past. Without another word, he took Evelyn's hand and turned to leave. "Let's go home."

Instead of following, Evelyn tightened her grip, signaling for him to wait.

Nathaniel paused, frowning slightly as he looked at her. What now?

Evelyn met Samuel's gaze calmly. "May I ask you something, Mr. Samuel? Is it a Rivera family tradition to demand a life debt from those you've saved?"

Samuel narrowed his eyes. "What are you implying?"

Evelyn smiled. "Does Nathaniel owe your sister his life just because she saved him? Would refusing to pledge himself make him ungrateful?"

Samuel remained silent, waiting for her to continue.

Evelyn tilted her head, a faint smirk playing on her lips. "Remember when I saved your grandfather? By your logic, does that mean he owes me his life too? Should you start calling me 'grandma' now?"

For the first time in his life, Samuel was rendered speechless. His expression darkened instantly. "Excuse me?"

Even Benjamin was stunned. What kind of nonsense is Evelyn spouting?

Zachary and the others were momentarily shocked before barely suppressing their laughter. None of them had ever seen someone dare to speak to the Rivers heir like that. Their entire worldview shifted in that moment.

Nathaniel frowned, glancing at Evelyn with a complicated expression. He wasn’t entirely pleased with her analogy.

Evelyn continued, "What I mean is, saving someone should come from genuine kindness—not as a bargaining chip for emotional manipulation or personal gain. Helping others is human nature, and those with a heart do it willingly. I’m sure someone as kind and selfless as your sister didn’t rescue my man here just because he’s handsome, right?"

Nathaniel arched a brow. While he liked hearing her call him my man, he wasn’t thrilled about being reduced to a pretty boy. He wasn’t sure if she was trying to provoke him too.

Benjamin’s usually composed face darkened, but he stayed silent.

Evelyn pressed on, "Nathaniel has never been ungrateful, and I won’t tolerate anyone calling him that. Yes, your sister saved him, but he’s never abandoned her. When she called for help, he rushed to her side—even escorted her home. Can you imagine someone of his status doing that? Hasn’t he helped her every time she needed it?"

"If your sister ever needed blood or an organ, I have no doubt Nathaniel would volunteer without hesitation. But emotional blackmail? That just makes the Rivers family look cheap and desperate."

Samuel was silent. Never in his life had he been cornered like this. He had no rebuttal.

Meanwhile, Oliver seethed in frustration. It was the first time he’d witnessed his employer being lectured by a young woman. Though he wanted to defend Samuel, he didn’t dare speak out of turn while his boss stayed quiet.
###Chapter 373

Evelyn had plenty more to say. A soft smile played on her lips as she continued, "And one more thing. Celeste isn't a copyrighted name, is it? If it isn't, then why can't I use it? Names that aren't copyrighted are free for anyone to use. You don’t get to dictate what I can or can’t call myself. The alphabet existed long before you or your family."

She tilted her chin up, her gaze unwavering. "Besides, I have no interest in pretending to be associated with the Rivers family. If I wanted a name to flaunt, I’d change mine to Nathaniel. You Rivers should stay far away from me from now on!"

With that sharp retort delivered, Evelyn stretched her arms and looped one through Nathaniel’s, her tone suddenly sweet. "Let’s go! I’ll treat you to dinner. There’s a restaurant upstairs that looks amazing."

Nathaniel blinked, momentarily caught off guard. "You’re treating me?"

Evelyn nodded, entirely unbothered. "Yes. With your money. Got a problem with that?"

A slow, amused smile curved his lips. "Not at all."

They turned, chatting easily as they walked hand in hand toward the escalator. Lucas Sinclair followed at a respectful distance, deliberately hanging back to give them space.

Meanwhile, Samuel Rivers stood frozen, his expression darkening with every word Evelyn had thrown at him. A man known for his composure, he had never been so thoroughly dismantled—least of all by a girl half his age. His jaw clenched, veins standing out on his forehead.

Oliver Kingsley, his secretary, shifted uncomfortably before speaking up. "Sir, don’t you think Mrs. Grayson was unnecessarily harsh? Just because she has Nathaniel’s backing doesn’t give her the right to speak to you like that."

Samuel took a slow, measured breath, forcing his temper under control before turning his sharp gaze toward the real source of this disaster—his reckless younger brother, Benjamin. "Go home," he ordered, his voice icy.

Benjamin flinched, his face burning from the earlier slap. Samuel had always been strict, but he had never struck him before. Swallowing his resentment, Benjamin lowered his head and obeyed without a word.

As the Rivers family dispersed, Zachary Montgomery finally snapped out of his daze and sauntered over to the three girls still lingering nearby. "See what a coward Benjamin is? All bark and no bite. The second his big brother shows up, he folds like a house of cards."

Emily Sinclair, who had been staring longingly after Nathaniel, rolled her eyes at Zachary. "And you think you’re any better? Always scheming and playing dirty. I can’t stand sore losers like you. Ugh!"

Zachary’s face fell. "Hey, that’s not fair—"

But Emily was already turning away, dragging her friends with her.

Fury twisted Zachary’s expression as he watched her go. One of his friends clapped him on the shoulder. "At least Benjamin’s gonna get chewed out when he gets home. Today wasn’t a total loss."

Zachary spat on the ground. "Just wait till school starts. I’ll make him pay."

Meanwhile, Amelia Rivers had arrived at the Whitmore residence and rung the doorbell.

Cassandra Whitmore answered, her eyes narrowing at the sight of the elegant woman standing on her doorstep. "Who are you looking for?"

Amelia offered a polite smile. "Is this Evelyn’s family?"

At the mention of Evelyn’s name, Cassandra’s expression soured further. "Who are you? And why are you asking about her?"

Amelia’s smile didn’t waver. "Actually, I’m not here for Evelyn. I’m here for you. You don’t know about her marriage, do you? I’m here to tell you the truth."

Cassandra’s eyes widened. "Marriage? What marriage? That little witch is married?"
###Chapter 374

Amelia nodded. "She is, and she's now married to the Graysons, one of the most powerful families in the city."

Cassandra's face twisted in disbelief. "What did you just say? That's impossible!"

Amelia maintained her gentle smile. "It's pouring outside, Miss Blackwood. Would you mind if I came in to explain everything properly?"

After a brief hesitation, Cassandra stepped aside. "Fine. Get in here and tell me exactly how Evelyn managed to marry Nathaniel! I need to know every detail about this sham of a marriage!"

Though she didn't recognize this stranger, the woman's words struck a chord with recent events.

Evelyn had vanished on what should have been Cassandra's wedding day to Nathaniel, only to reappear the next morning wearing an expensive men's designer jacket. She'd immediately demanded to move out of the family home. Cassandra had secretly followed her sister to an exclusive downtown penthouse, where Evelyn claimed to be working as a maid for her thesis research.

Looking back, everything seemed suspicious.

Then there was that strange incident when director Vincent Blackwood arranged for Cassandra to visit Nathaniel at Silver Moon Estate. Nathaniel had kept staring at Evelyn - who was posing as Cassandra's assistant - with the most peculiar expression.

The pieces were falling into place in the worst possible way. 'That conniving little bitch stole my wedding day! She took Nathaniel right from under my nose! How dare she!'

Fifteen minutes later, Amelia had finished her carefully embellished account of Evelyn's marriage to Nathaniel for Gregory, Victoria, and Cassandra.

Cassandra shot up from the couch, trembling with rage. "Father! Mother! You heard that! Evelyn stole my husband! I knew something was wrong with that wedding! Why would the Graysons deliver the dowry but never ask for its return? It was all a mistake!"

She paced furiously. "This is all Evelyn's doing! She tricked Nathaniel into not collecting his real bride - me! That scheming whore seduced my fiancé and took my place in the Grayson family! That should have been my life! She's despicable!"

Victoria's face darkened with matching fury. The wedding day humiliation when Gregory had struck her before their relatives still burned in her memory. 'So Evelyn was behind everything!'

Gregory sat frozen, the truth hitting him like a physical blow. His least favorite daughter had somehow married into one of the most powerful families in the city - a position meant for his precious Cassandra.

The atmosphere in the Blackwood living room crackled with barely contained rage and bitter realization.
###Chapter 375

Victoria clutched Gregory's arm, her face a mix of fury and despair. "Gregory! Evelyn learned nothing but wicked tricks from that countryside upbringing. Even after getting into a city university, she's still strayed from the right path! All she cares about is scheming her way into high society!"

Her voice trembled with indignation. "When she saw Cassandra had caught Nathaniel's eye and was about to marry into the Graysons, that jealous little snake snatched the opportunity right from under her! After Cassandra left the entertainment industry for marriage, her career never recovered—and now, even her chance at a good match is gone!"

A sob escaped her as she wiped away bitter tears, heartbroken for her beloved daughter.

Gregory's expression darkened as he took in his wife and daughter's distress. From the moment Amelia started explaining the situation, his frown had deepened, a slow-burning rage simmering beneath the surface.

But unlike Victoria and Cassandra, he was more cautious. His sharp eyes studied Amelia—this well-dressed, poised woman who had appeared out of nowhere with such damning information.

"Who are you?" he demanded. "Why do you know so much about the Graysons? Why come to us with this? What's your motive?"

Amelia had anticipated this. She smiled smoothly. "Does my identity matter? I simply can't stand watching Evelyn take what isn't hers. I came out of goodwill, hoping Miss Cassandra can reclaim what rightfully belongs to her."

She placed a pre-printed note on the table—the address of the Grayson estate. No handwriting to trace.

Cassandra snatched it up, her face twisting in outrage. "Dad! This is the place! Remember when I followed her? She lied—she wasn’t working as a maid there! She stole my future, my husband!"

Gregory's last shred of doubt vanished. He slammed his fist on the table. "That ungrateful wretch! How dare she betray her own sister like this?"

Cassandra's chest heaved with resentment. She had lost everything—her career, her status, her chance at wealth. The injustice burned like acid.

"You have to make this right, Dad! Evelyn ruined my life! She turned this family upside down, stole my future, and now she’s living the high life while I’m left with nothing!"

Victoria wailed in agreement. "I’ve tolerated your favoritism before, but this? This is too much! She can’t just trample over Cassandra like this!"

Gregory's jaw clenched. After a tense silence, he spoke, voice low and dangerous.

"Don’t worry. Tomorrow, we go to the Graysons. That treacherous girl will return every single thing she stole."
###Chapter 376

It didn't matter which of Gregory's daughters married into the Grayson family.

The outcome would still make him Nathaniel's father-in-law.

Yet in his heart, he secretly wished his favorite daughter—Cassandra—would become Nathaniel's wife.

Gregory cared little for Evelyn. They'd never lived together as a proper family.

She'd been raised in some rural backwater, far from his influence. Even if she married into wealth, he'd gain nothing.

'That ungrateful brat has been hiding at the Grayson estate since the wedding. Not one visit!' Gregory fumed.

He believed Cassandra would've been the better choice. As her father, he could've basked in reflected glory.

The Whitmore family trio schemed revenge against Evelyn's insolence when Amelia quietly excused herself.

A smug smile played on her lips as she left. Her objective had been achieved.

Though living abroad, Amelia kept tabs on all developments back home.

To escape his grandfather's marriage pressure, Nathaniel had devised a plan—find a woman willing to fake an engagement.

Initially, he'd chosen Isabella from Cativa's martial arts lineage.

But fate intervened. Bad weather delayed Isabella's flight, making her miss the engagement party.

Desperate, Nathaniel recruited Evelyn instead. The exact circumstances remained unclear to Amelia.

Amelia knew Cassandra had publicly announced her retirement from entertainment after Nathaniel sent Lucas with engagement gifts.

Something must have changed, because Evelyn—not Cassandra—became the bride.

Amelia suspected foul play. Evelyn must have sabotaged her sister's chances to secure the wealthy match.

Investigations revealed the Whitmores had thrown an extravagant wedding banquet for Cassandra.

They'd proclaimed their eldest daughter would marry the city's most eligible bachelor.

Yet Nathaniel never showed. The Whitmores became laughingstocks among their peers.

This information became Amelia's weapon to drive a wedge between Evelyn and her family.

She wanted Cassandra to reclaim her rightful place.

Amelia instantly recognized Cassandra as a dime-a-dozen celebrity wannabe.

Nathaniel would never genuinely desire such a woman.

But Evelyn was different. She possessed an authentic charm—playful yet grounded, innocent yet bold.

Her free-spirited nature fascinated Nathaniel in ways Amelia couldn't replicate.

Even if she couldn't remove Evelyn immediately, Amelia would make her suffer.

She'd ensure Nathaniel saw Evelyn's true colors—a gold-digger from a mediocre family.

Once Nathaniel understood Evelyn's background, his affection would surely fade.

Amelia eagerly anticipated the coming drama at Silver Moon Estate.

Rain poured as Evelyn and Nathaniel left the Italian restaurant.

Lucas handed Nathaniel an open umbrella, which he immediately tilted toward Evelyn.

"How are we getting home today? Subway or bus?" Nathaniel asked.

Evelyn studied the downpour, then cocked her head at him.

"Your car's right here. Making you take public transit in this weather would be cruel."

A smirk played on her lips. "I may not be conventional, but I'm not completely heartless."
###Chapter 377

Nathaniel glanced at Lucas and signaled with a subtle nod to bring the car around. His gaze then returned to the mischievous Evelyn, fingers brushing through her hair as he murmured, "Of course, I know you're the most considerate woman alive."

Evelyn's lips pursed. He's humoring me, but why does it sound so patronizing?

After ensuring she was safely inside, Nathaniel folded the umbrella and slid in beside her. The car pulled away from the mall, tires whispering against wet pavement.

Evelyn checked her phone, replying to messages before turning to Nathaniel with narrowed eyes. "How exactly did you know I'd be at that mall today?"

Nathaniel ignored her, picking up a document from the seat instead.

Evelyn inched closer, her voice dripping with suspicion. "Tell me, Nathaniel—did you plant another tracker on me?"

He finally looked up, meeting her challenging stare. With a resigned sigh, he admitted, "Yes. But only because of the storm."

Evelyn scowled. "Rain doesn't give you the right to stalk me."

Nathaniel flipped a page, his tone measured. "I'll try to refrain."

"Try?" she echoed, unimpressed.

"Some situations require it," he said, voice hardening. "Your safety isn't negotiable."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Spare me the noble act. This is about control."

Nathaniel set the document aside and yanked her onto his lap, fingers tightening under her chin. "You're right. I do want control over you—among other things. Care to discover what else I crave?"

Heat flooded her cheeks. "Don't you dare—"

His breath ghosted over her lips. "I've waited too long, little troublemaker."

Lucas discreetly raised the privacy partition.

Trapped, Evelyn blurted, "What did Amelia sacrifice to save you?"

Nathaniel froze, his expression darkening.

Evelyn grinned. "Let me guess—her virtue?"

"Enough," he growled.

"Then answer properly," she pressed, undeterred by his discomfort.

"The past stays buried," Nathaniel said tightly.

Evelyn shrugged, wriggling free. "Fine. We all have secrets we'd rather keep."

Nathaniel's jaw clenched. What is she hiding? The thought gnawed at him as she settled back into her seat, victorious.

He exhaled sharply. She'd outmaneuvered him—again.
###Chapter 378

The drive back to Silver Moon Estate was quiet. Evelyn Whitmore leaned against the window, exhausted from Benjamin Rivers' relentless attention all afternoon.

Her stomach pleasantly full, all she craved now was a hot shower and her soft bed.

Nathaniel Grayson followed her up the grand staircase silently. Just as her fingers brushed the doorknob, his larger hand covered hers, trapping it beneath his warm palm.

Evelyn froze. "Mr. Grayson?" She tilted her head up, meeting his intense gaze.

He leaned in until his lips nearly touched her ear. "I need to—"

She shivered, pulling away instinctively. "N-need to what?" Her voice came out embarrassingly high.

Nathaniel's breath was warm against her skin as he murmured, "Need to come in."

Those three simple words sent heat rushing to Evelyn's cheeks. The way he said it—low and rough—made her pulse quicken.

Her body responded instantly, but she steeled herself. "If you're serious about me, you'll learn patience."

His grip tightened briefly before releasing. Straightening, he ruffled her hair. "Fine. I'll wait until you invite me in yourself. Rest well."

As Nathaniel turned toward his study, Evelyn called out, "Wait!"

He paused, glancing back. "Yes?"

She crooked a finger, beckoning him closer. When he bent down, she rose on tiptoes and pressed a quick kiss to his cheek.

"Thank you for the umbrella today. No one's ever done that for me before. Goodnight."

The door clicked shut before Nathaniel could respond. He touched the spot where her lips had been, still warm.

A slow smile spread across his face as he walked away.

Fresh from her shower, Evelyn booted up her laptop. She logged into her work email, curious if Nathaniel had reviewed her designs.

There it was—an unread message from him. She clicked immediately.

His reply was characteristically brief: [The design shows promise, but misses the essence I envisioned.]

Evelyn groaned. Typical client behavior—vague feedback with no concrete direction.

She typed back: [Mr. Grayson, I appreciate your feedback. Could you please describe the aesthetic you're seeking? Specific details would help tremendously.]

After sending, she reached for her hair dryer. By the time her hair was dry, Nathaniel's reply already waited in her inbox.

This time, his response was more detailed.
###Chapter 379

Nathaniel's message burned into Evelyn's screen.

[Soul. What I demand is your complete emotional investment in this design. It must embody Holden Group's dedication to public value. I didn't hire you just for technical skill—I hired you because of the passion you poured into Celestial Pursuit. Don't insult me with this rushed, hollow draft. Evelyn, your talent is undeniable, but your effort here is lacking.]

Evelyn's fingers hovered over the keyboard. He wasn’t wrong. She had relied on polished technique rather than genuine inspiration.

He’s right. She exhaled sharply. Fifteen million dollars deserves more than a soulless blueprint. I need to approach this like I did with Celestial Pursuit.

Her reply was swift. [Understood. Give me time. The next draft will meet your expectations.]

Nathaniel didn’t respond.

Evelyn slumped at her desk, chin propped on her palm. The previous design was useless now—she had to start fresh. A new concept for Holden Group’s flagship building…

Morning light spilled through the curtains when Nathaniel left, instructing Theodore not to disturb her.

Unbeknownst to Evelyn, trouble was already at the gates.

Cassandra stepped out of the car, lips curling as she gestured to the mansion. "Mom, Dad—this is it. I saw her walk in like she owned the place."

Gregory and Victoria gaped at the sprawling estate. Downtown property of this scale wasn’t just about wealth—it screamed influence. Only families like the Graysons could command such real estate.

Victoria’s voice dripped bitterness. "Our daughter should be living here as Nathaniel’s wife. Instead, we’re stuck outside like beggars."

Gregory’s jaw tightened. Fifteen million dollars—gone, thanks to Evelyn. He’d get answers today.

"Ring the bell," he ordered.

Cassandra jabbed the button repeatedly. The gate remained shut, but the intercom crackled to life.

"May I help you?" Theodore’s polite voice filtered through.

"We’re here for Evelyn. Is she home?" Cassandra snapped.

Theodore’s tone cooled instantly. "And you are?"

Victoria smoothly cut in, nudging her fuming daughter aside. "We’re Evelyn’s family. We’d love to visit her, if she’s available."

Cassandra’s nails dug into her palms. "Ma’am," he’d called her. Just like Amelia had said.

"Did you hear that?" she hissed. "It’s true! That little nobody is acting like she’s—"

Victoria silenced her with a sharp look. Smiling at the intercom, she added, "We’d appreciate it if you’d let us in."
###Chapter 380

Theodore was taken aback by Victoria's words, but quickly composed himself with a polite smile. 'So these are Madam's relatives! What a privilege to host them. I must ensure they receive the highest level of hospitality.'

Yet caution prevailed. He couldn't risk admitting strangers without verification. "Please wait here," he said smoothly. "I'll need to notify Madam first."

He excused himself and ascended the grand staircase. Though Nathaniel had explicitly ordered not to disturb Evelyn's rest, these unexpected visitors left no alternative.

The sharp rapping startled Evelyn awake. "Yes?" she murmured drowsily.

"Madam," Theodore announced through the door, "there's a middle-aged couple with a daughter claiming to be your relatives. Should I admit them?"

Evelyn's sleep-fogged mind processed this. 'Middle-aged couple? A daughter my age? My family?'

Recognition struck like lightning. Her eyes flew open, all traces of sleep vanishing.

'The Whitmores found me? How?' She ran fingers through her disheveled hair, considering. 'If they tracked me to Nathaniel's estate, they already know about our marriage. No use hiding now.'

"Show them to the parlor," she instructed calmly. "I'll be down shortly."

Cassandra's impatience had reached boiling point. She seethed, convinced this delay was intentional disrespect. 'Once I reclaim my rightful place as Mrs. Grayson, that insolent butler will be my first dismissal,' she vowed silently.

When the gates finally swung open, two maids emerged with deferential bows. Cassandra's nostrils flared. "How dare you keep us waiting!" she snapped before they could speak. "Do you enjoy risking your positions?"

The maids exchanged bewildered glances. Theodore had emphasized treating these guests with utmost courtesy as Madam's family. Yet this woman behaved like she owned the estate.

'Who does she think she is?' one maid thought indignantly. 'Barking orders like she's already mistress of Silver Moon?'

The other barely suppressed an eye roll. 'As if Mr. Nathaniel would entertain her delusions.'
###Chapter 381

The two maids exchanged glances.

"Does she think she can waltz in here making demands just because she's Evelyn's sister?" one whispered.

They'd been trained never to show displeasure to guests, so they maintained polite expressions while leading the Whitmores inside.

Cassandra had visited the estate grounds before with Evelyn, but never stepped foot in the main house. Her eyes darted around greedily, taking in every detail.

When they reached the inner courtyard, her face twisted in distaste.

Crossing her arms like she owned the place, she sneered at the landscaping. "This place isn't terrible, but this outdated Victorian decor has to go. We'll need a complete renovation after I move in."

She pointed dramatically at the ancient pine tree. "That eyesore blocks all the sunlight. Chop it down immediately. And these marble tiles? Replace them with championship-grade turf - and plant my signature roses, of course. Only royal European gardens suit my celebrity status."

Victoria nodded eagerly. "Absolutely, darling. Such a waste of space otherwise."

The maids barely concealed their shock. Every plant in this courtyard was priceless - especially the century-old pine that predated Nathaniel's birth. And those "rustic" potted orchids? Mr. Grayson's prized collection worth more than diamonds.

Bowen - no, Theodore - waited in the grand hall with practiced patience. His smile remained perfectly polite as the Whitmores entered.

"Mr. Whitmore, Mrs. Blackwood, Miss Whitmore, welcome. Madam will join you shortly."

Cassandra smirked. "Oh, you're that fossil who spoke through the intercom."

Theodore's smile faltered for half a second before professionalism won out. "Theodore Whitmore, head butler. At your service."

She looked him up and down with disdain. "We'll need to replace you too. Far too ancient."

His eyebrows twitched. Never in his decades of service had anyone been so brazenly rude.

Before he could finish offering refreshments, the Whitmores barged past him into the living room, sprawling on the antique sofas like they owned them.

Theodore exhaled slowly. In all his years serving the Graysons, he'd never witnessed such appalling manners - not even from visiting royalty.

'Well,' he thought dryly, 'there's a first time for everything.'
###Chapter 382

The two servants escorting the Blackwoods approached Theodore and whispered, "Mr. Whitmore, are they really Madam's family? Their behavior is so...unlike hers."

"Indeed. They're acting like they own the estate rather than being guests. Earlier, they even demanded to remodel the entire garden! Wanted to chop down the century-old oak and toss out Mr. Richard's prized roses!"

Theodore's brow furrowed at the Blackwoods' audacity. "Enough chatter. Remember your place - they're Madam's relatives. Go prepare coffee and arrange some refreshments immediately. We must show them every courtesy for their first visit."

"Yes, Mr. Whitmore," the maids replied in unison before hurrying to the kitchen.

Cassandra lounged lazily on the plush designer sofa, marveling at its superior comfort compared to their worn furniture at home. Though luxurious, she wrinkled her nose at the traditional decor. "Everything here is so outdated," she complained, surveying the grand hall with disdain. "This place desperately needs modernizing."

Victoria patted her daughter's hand knowingly. "Patience, darling. Once you're mistress of Silver Moon Estate, you can redecorate however you please. Nathaniel will surely indulge your every whim."

Cassandra's cheeks flushed as Nathaniel's striking features flashed through her mind. 'The most breathtaking man I've ever seen. Even without the Grayson fortune, I'd marry him in a heartbeat.' Her expression darkened. 'That Evelyn stole him from me. If she's touched him, I'll make her pay dearly.'

A maid entered with refreshments. Gregory accepted the coffee with an air of sophistication, then grimaced after one sip. "What is this weak brew?"

"This is our finest Blue Mountain blend, sir. I can prepare something stronger if you prefer."

Blue Mountain coffee - the rarest and most expensive variety. Gregory, having never tasted it before, coughed awkwardly. "No need. It's...acceptable. Where is Evelyn? Why is she keeping us waiting?"

The maid remained silent.

Theodore stepped forward smoothly. "Madam is preparing herself, Mr. Blackwood. Please enjoy these refreshments while you wait."

Gregory's face reddened with indignation. "Does she think herself royalty now that she's married into this family? How dare she make us wait!"
###Chapter 383

Cassandra shot up from the sofa, her face twisted in fury. "Unbelievable! Is Evelyn deliberately making us wait? How dare she keep her own family waiting downstairs? She must be drowning in guilt right now. Fine! I'll drag that little brat down myself!"

She stormed toward the staircase, heels clicking sharply against the marble floor. Theodore's eyes narrowed, and with a subtle nod, he signaled a nearby servant to intercept her.

The uniformed staff member stepped firmly into Cassandra's path, making her stumble back. "How dare you block me?" she shrieked, eyes blazing with indignation.

The servant stood his ground, unmoving.

Theodore approached with measured steps. "My apologies, Miss Whitmore, but the upper floors are private residence areas. As guests, we must respect the household rules."

Cassandra's laugh was sharp as broken glass. "Guests? Don't you know who I am? I'm supposed to be—"

"Cassandra, must you always make such a scene before breakfast?" Evelyn's voice floated down from the second-floor landing, dripping with amusement.

Cassandra's head snapped up. Her nails dug into her palms as she took in Evelyn's effortless beauty—no makeup, hair slightly tousled, wearing nothing but simple silk pajamas. The sight made her blood boil.

"You!" Cassandra pointed an accusing finger. "That old liar said you were getting dressed! You just rolled out of bed, didn't you? Making us wait like fools!"

Evelyn leaned against the railing, a lazy smile playing on her lips. "I never specified how long 'getting ready' would take."

Cassandra lunged for the stairs again, but Theodore and the servant formed an immovable wall. "Move!" she demanded through clenched teeth. "Do you have any idea who you're dealing with? I'll have you all fired!"

Theodore's polite mask slipped slightly. "Miss Whitmore, while you're indeed family, these are Mr. Grayson's explicit rules. No one ascends without his permission."

"Then explain why she's allowed up there!" Cassandra shrieked, jabbing her finger toward Evelyn.

Theodore sighed. "Because Mrs. Grayson resides here."

Cassandra's entire arm trembled with rage. "She's NOT Mrs. Grayson! I am! That marriage was supposed to be mine, and today I'm taking back what's rightfully—"

Theodore's eyes widened. "Excuse me?"
###Chapter 384

Cassandra smirked with satisfaction at Nathaniel's stunned expression. "You heard me right.

I'm the true Mrs. Grayson now - the woman every servant in this house should obey!"

Theodore had faced countless challenging situations in his decades of service, mastering the art of maintaining composure.

Yet even he couldn't suppress a sudden burst of laughter at Cassandra's outrageous claim. His amusement proved contagious, sparking chuckles among the assembled staff.

Cassandra flushed crimson under their mocking gazes. "How dare you laugh at me! I'm speaking the truth!"

Theodore quickly schooled his features back into professional neutrality. "My apologies, Miss Whitmore. Perhaps you're still suffering from jet lag? We have excellent guest rooms on the second floor if you'd like to rest."

"You—" Cassandra's hands clenched into fists, humiliation burning through her. "Ugh! I won't waste my breath explaining to ignorant servants. Just wait - you'll all regret treating me this way!"

The staff exchanged pitying glances, their expressions suggesting they doubted Cassandra's mental stability.

Furious, Cassandra whirled to face Evelyn watching calmly from the third-floor landing. If she couldn't intimidate the servants, she'd redirect her rage toward an easier target.

"Stop gawking, Evelyn! Get down here now! We've waited long enough!"

Evelyn stretched lazily before descending with deliberate slowness. "Theodore, please escort the staff out. I'll handle my... family... alone."

The butler hesitated. "Miss Whitmore, are you certain—"

He didn't trust the Whitmores' hostile demeanor or their apparent estrangement from Evelyn. The situation felt volatile.

Evelyn offered a reassuring smile. "They won't bite. At least, not hard enough to draw blood."

"Very well." Theodore bowed before ushering the staff out, though he discreetly stationed several maids nearby.

With the audience gone, Cassandra lunged forward, hand raised to strike—only for Evelyn to intercept her wrist mid-swing.

"Tsk tsk." Evelyn tutted, arching one eyebrow. "Is this how you greet family after so long? What would Nathaniel think if he saw his future bride behaving like a fishwife?"

Cassandra struggled against Evelyn's iron grip, her frustration mounting. Though she cared nothing for Evelyn's opinion, the mention of Nathaniel's potential disapproval gave her pause.

This was the Grayson estate after all. If word of her temper reached Nathaniel, it could damage their budding relationship. Better to play the demure lady—for now.

She wrenched her arm free, wiping her wrist as if contaminated. "Father's waiting in the parlor. He has questions for you, so move your lazy ass!"
###Chapter 385

Evelyn gave a slight nod before strolling casually into the living room.

"Mr. Whitmore, Mrs. Blackwood, it's been some time," she greeted with a polite but distant smile.

Gregory's brow furrowed. 'Did she just call me Mr. Whitmore?' Aloud, he demanded, "What did you just call me, you ungrateful girl?"

Evelyn chose an armchair far from where the Whitmores sat. She deliberately sipped the Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee the maid served before meeting his gaze. "Is there a problem with calling you Mr. Whitmore? That is your surname, isn't it?"

After discovering she shared no blood with Gregory, Evelyn couldn't—wouldn't—call him 'Father' anymore. He wasn't her biological parent, nor had he raised her. A man who'd abandoned her to the countryside didn't deserve that title.

Gregory glared at Evelyn, his irritation growing by the minute. "Evelyn Whitmore, don't think marrying into wealth means you can disown your family. And we all know exactly how you became Mrs. Grayson!"

Evelyn's eyebrow arched, though her fingers tightened around the cup. "You seem very certain about how I became Mrs. Grayson, Mr. Whitmore."

Before Gregory could respond, Cassandra interrupted sharply, "We all know! Mother and I too! Evelyn, secrets never stay buried forever. Confess your crime now, and I might show you mercy... stepsister."

A dry chuckle escaped Evelyn. "Mercy? Cassandra, what imaginary wrong have I done this time to require your... generosity?"

The phrase 'my house' struck Cassandra like a dagger. She bristled. "Your house? How dare you! This is clearly my home!"

Victoria leaned against Gregory, speaking softly. "Evelyn, confess while Cassandra's still willing to forgive. We know you stole her place in the Grayson marriage. There's no point denying it. Now be good—kneel and apologize to your father and sister."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. "How exactly did you discover this?"

Her question sounded like admission to the Whitmores. Gregory's face purpled with rage. "Evelyn Whitmore! I didn't raise you to be this shameless! Have you no decency? Stealing your sister's fiancé? You've made us the laughingstock of our circle! I never should've brought you back from that village!"

The irony almost made Evelyn laugh. She'd earned her university scholarship through top exam scores—Gregory had done nothing. And his constant claims of raising her? Pure fiction.

Their motives became clear after Cassandra's harassment of Theodore. But how had they uncovered her marriage?

Cassandra sneered at Evelyn's silence. "Cat got your tongue? Feeling guilty now that we've exposed you?"

Evelyn lowered her head as if ashamed. "Since you know everything... I suppose the only question is... what punishment do you have in mind?"
###Chapter 386

Evelyn's lowered gaze only fueled Cassandra's arrogance. "How should we punish you? That depends entirely on my mood and how sincerely you apologize."

Victoria sighed dramatically, placing a gentle hand on her daughter's arm. "Let it go, Cassandra. Evelyn is still your sister after all. We shouldn't be too harsh."

Turning to Evelyn with false warmth, Victoria continued, "Darling, you've stolen Cassandra's rightful place as Mrs. Grayson for far too long. But we're willing to overlook your childish mistakes if you simply vacate the position gracefully. Pack your things and leave Nathaniel's life forever. Promise never to interfere between them again, and we'll consider the matter closed."

"But Mother!" Cassandra protested petulantly.

Victoria shot her a warning look. "For your father's sake, Cassandra. Think of Gregory."

Understanding flashed in Cassandra's eyes. Removing Evelyn from the Grayson estate was the priority - there would be time for revenge later.

Gregory watched his wife's performance with misty eyes. "Victoria, I can't thank you enough for your generosity toward my ungrateful daughter after everything she's done to you and Cassandra."

"Oh darling, we're family!" Victoria simpered, though everyone except Gregory and Cassandra saw through her act.

Gregory's guilt transformed into rage. "Well? Aren't you going to thank your aunt for her kindness, you wretched girl? Don't test our patience - take this chance or face the consequences!"

Evelyn rose gracefully and bowed. "Thank you, Aunt Victoria, for your mercy. I'm truly grateful for this opportunity to make amends. I'll gather my belongings immediately."

The trio stared in shock. Victoria had expected dramatic resistance, not this docile surrender. She'd envisioned dragging Evelyn out kicking and screaming to highlight her own saintly patience.

Evelyn tilted her head innocently when met with silence. "Is something wrong? Would you prefer I stay to care for Cassandra as penance?"

Cassandra recovered first. "Absolutely not! You'll leave today after explaining everything to Nathaniel. And don't you dare lie about what happened!"

"Of course," Evelyn agreed. "Though he's working now. Shall I interrupt his important meeting? He does get quite cross when disturbed. Might take it out on all of us later..."

Cassandra and Victoria exchanged uncertain glances.

"Fine!" Cassandra snapped. "Wait until he returns. But start packing now - the moment he hears your confession, you're out!"
###Chapter 387

"Alright, absolutely!" Evelyn responded without hesitation.

She immediately turned to the bewildered maid standing beside her. "Gather Theodore and the rest of the staff immediately." The maid blinked rapidly, nodded, and hurried off to comply. Within minutes, Theodore and the household staff assembled in the grand living room.

"Everyone, meet my sister Cassandra." Evelyn's voice carried solemn authority. "She's the woman Nathaniel originally intended to marry, which makes her the rightful Mrs. Grayson. The couple beside her are her parents—the true in-laws of the Grayson family."

The staff exchanged shocked glances, some wondering if this was some elaborate joke. But Evelyn's grave expression left no room for doubt.

"My duties here are concluded. From now on, you'll serve the new mistress of the house." Evelyn adjusted her sleeves. "I'll be upstairs packing my belongings so the real Mrs. Grayson can take residence."

Cassandra smirked, savoring the moment. Those insolent servants who'd dared question her earlier would regret their impertinence. She imagined Theodore trembling with fear now that he knew her true identity.

The head butler looked utterly perplexed. He followed Evelyn up the staircase. "Madam, what's really happening here?"

Evelyn waved him off without breaking stride. "Your only concern is ensuring their comfort, Theodore. Everything else can wait until Nathaniel returns."

"Yes, Madam," Theodore replied, though worry creased his brow.

Downstairs, Cassandra tapped her foot impatiently. When Evelyn didn't reappear, she moved toward the staircase—only to find Theodore blocking her path. "I must insist you remain downstairs."

Cassandra's face flushed crimson. "You senile fool! Didn't you hear what Evelyn said about who I am?"

Theodore remained unmoved. "Until Mr. Grayson verifies your identity, these are my standing orders."

Cassandra's nails dug into her palms. These servants were treating her with more respect, but this stubborn old man still resisted. She forced a condescending smile. "Very well. But remember this moment when I have full authority here. Now, my parents are hungry—prepare a meal using only the finest ingredients. If I discover any shortcuts..." Her smile turned predatory. "Nathaniel will hear about it."

Theodore's jaw tightened, but he maintained his composure. Every fiber of his being wanted to eject these rude intruders, but Evelyn's instructions were clear. "The kitchen will prepare something suitable," he said through clenched teeth.

By the time Nathaniel returned that evening, the Blackwoods had made themselves thoroughly at home. Gregory lay snoring on the sofa, shoes discarded carelessly. Victoria lounged while watching television and painting her nails. Cassandra sampled expensive desserts only to complain, "Where did you find this so-called pastry chef? This chocolate mousse lacks any sweetness whatsoever. Nathaniel must replace him immediately!"
###Chapter 388

Nathaniel paused at the doorway. The blaring television immediately alerted him that something was off. His sharp gaze landed on three unfamiliar figures lounging in his living room, causing his storm-gray eyes to darken instantly.

The household staff greeted him as always. One maid reached for his tailored suit jacket while another knelt with his velvet slippers. Nathaniel shrugged off the jacket but ignored the offered footwear.

"Who are they?" His baritone voice cut through the air like winter frost.

The maids exchanged nervous glances. "Sir, they're Madam Evelyn's relatives, but—" The words died in her throat, uncertain how to explain the 'new Mrs. Grayson' situation without causing an explosion.

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "But what?"

Before the trembling maid could respond, Theodore materialized like a guardian angel. "Sir, these are Madam's parents and sister. They arrived this morning for a visit."

'Evelyn's family?' Nathaniel's posture relaxed slightly as he strode toward the living room. The ice in his expression thawed—if this marriage was becoming permanent, he'd need to make nice with her relatives.

"Where is she?" The usual steel in his voice softened noticeably at the mention of his wife.

Theodore's face twisted with discomfort. "Madam is... packing her belongings upstairs. She mentioned needing to vacate the space for her sister."

'Packing?' Nathaniel's brows knitted together. 'What fresh hell is this? Things were perfect between us yesterday.' He opened his mouth to demand answers when movement caught his eye.

Cassandra sprang from the sofa, dessert forgotten. Her eyes sparkled as they landed on Nathaniel's imposing frame. "Nathaniel! You're home!" she trilled, rushing forward with outstretched hands.

Theodore had only begun unraveling today's drama, leaving Nathaniel unaware of the landmine he was stepping on. For now, he offered Cassandra a curt nod. "Welcome." The single word carried all the warmth of a December morning.
###Chapter 389

A casual greeting slipped from Nathaniel Grayson's lips—something rare for the aristocratic heir.

Cassandra's pulse quickened with excitement.

This had to mean something. Why else would the notoriously distant Nathaniel show her such courtesy?

His acknowledgment proved she was always meant to be his bride. Hadn't Amelia confirmed yesterday that Nathaniel fell for her after watching her film performance? Those engagement gifts were clearly meant for her.

Then Evelyn had inserted herself between them. Nathaniel's people must have confused the sisters—understandable given their vague resemblance. Though Cassandra refused to see it, others obviously did.

'And that plain-faced Evelyn never wears makeup,' Cassandra fumed internally. 'He probably assumed that's how I look naturally. A man like Nathaniel wouldn't remember every actress's face after one viewing. That scheming witch stole my identity for months! How dare she take what's mine!'

She forced herself to focus. Cursing Evelyn could wait. Right now, she needed to captivate Nathaniel.

Tossing her professionally styled hair, she flashed what she considered her most alluring smile. "Nathaniel, we met at Silver Moon Estate," she cooed. "Do you recall?"

His gaze flickered across her features. "Vaguely."

Her heart soared. 'Of course he remembers! I made an unforgettable impression. Now that we're reunited, he'll fall for me all over again.'

Across the living room, Victoria nudged the dozing Gregory. "He's home," she whispered urgently.

Gregory jerked awake, straightening his posture instantly. Following Victoria's gesture, his eyes landed on Cassandra conversing with a statuesque man who seemed sculpted by Renaissance masters. Even a jaded businessman like Gregory couldn't deny Nathaniel's extraordinary presence.

'The rumors don't do him justice,' Gregory marveled. 'The Grayson heir combines brilliance with breathtaking looks. And soon he'll call me father-in-law!'

Adjusting his collar, Gregory puffed out his chest and led Victoria toward the couple. "Nathaniel, son! We've been awaiting your return all day," he announced grandly.

Nathaniel's eyebrow arched slightly. His impassive gaze swept over Gregory before offering a polite nod. "An honor, sir. I look forward to benefiting from your wisdom."

Gregory nearly burst with pride. 'The Grayson heir seeks my counsel! Those fools who mocked me at the wedding will grovel now. Not even Nathaniel dares disrespect me—I'm practically family already!'

Visions of high society doors swinging open danced through Gregory's mind. With Nathaniel's influence, his social ascent was guaranteed.
###Chapter 390

Gregory tilted his head up to meet Nathaniel's towering frame. The older man decided to mirror the younger's composed demeanor, playing the part of the sagely elder. He gave an approving nod. "What a fine son-in-law you make! I have no doubt we'll get along splendidly."

Victoria beamed, stepping forward. "Nathaniel, you must be exhausted from work. As your mother, I'd be delighted to prepare my famous lamb stew for you."

Beside them, Theodore's brow furrowed in displeasure. Had he heard correctly? 'Did Mrs. Blackwood just refer to herself as Master Nathaniel's mother? Even if she were, such familiarity is highly improper. These people lack all sense of boundaries and decorum.'

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed to slits, his expression unreadable. He turned to Theodore with a curt command. "Ensure Mr. and Mrs. Blackwood are comfortable while I check on Evelyn upstairs."

"At once, sir," Theodore replied.

"Nathaniel, wait!" Cassandra rushed forward, deliberately brushing against his muscular frame. She wanted to prove to the butler that she could go wherever Nathaniel went. 'Let's see if that pompous old fool dares stop me now!' More urgently, she feared what might happen if Evelyn had Nathaniel alone in her bedroom.

Nathaniel halted abruptly, his gaze turning glacial. "That won't be possible." His voice carried winter's bite. "Wait in the parlor. I'll bring Evelyn down shortly."

Cassandra gaped. 'What? Why—' The rejection stung. 'Didn't he just smile at me earlier?'

Theodore barely concealed his satisfaction. 'The woman's delusions know no bounds. Does she truly believe the master holds any affection for her? He tolerates her presence solely because she's Madam's sister. Delusional doesn't begin to cover it.'

Undeterred, Cassandra leaned in, her voice dripping honey. "Oh come now, Nathaniel. I only want to check on my dear sister. Surely that's not too much to ask?" Her hand reached for his arm.

Nathaniel sidestepped her touch with military precision. "What do you think you're doing?" The dangerous edge in his voice made her recoil.

Cassandra floundered. "I—I just—"

'This makes no sense! Men always fall for my charms. Why is he so immune?'

Just then, Evelyn's melodic voice floated down the staircase. "Nathaniel! You're home!"

All eyes turned upward as Nathaniel's frosty demeanor thawed instantly. His entire focus shifted toward the sound of her voice, leaving Cassandra forgotten on the stairs.
###Chapter 391

"An explanation is necessary."

Nathaniel's piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn, completely ignoring Cassandra's simpering expression. His large hand reached out, effortlessly taking the suitcase from Evelyn and passing it to Theodore standing nearby.

"What's all this drama about?" His deep voice held an edge as he wrapped his arms possessively around Evelyn's waist, pulling her flush against him as if afraid she might actually leave.

Evelyn squirmed slightly at the public display of affection, pressing against his chest in a futile attempt to create distance. When that failed, she sighed dramatically before launching into her explanation.

"It began when you went to fetch your bride from the Blackwoods. Protocol dictated you use the front entrance, but no—you snuck in through the back and whisked me away instead! Now that the truth's out and they've realized you picked the wrong woman that day, Cassandra's demanding I surrender my position as Mrs. Grayson. Naturally, my only option was to pack up and leave!"

Cassandra scowled at Evelyn's blunt retelling, shooting her a venomous glare before sweetly interjecting, "My sister summarizes it rather crudely. The fact remains—I was your intended bride. This entire situation stems from my sister's childish mischief and her tendency to take what isn't hers!"

She adjusted her posture, adopting what she believed was a dignified expression. "I came today out of concern for our family's reputation. Someone raised in the countryside with no understanding of high society would only embarrass the Grayson name. Surely you agree it's best we correct this mistake and assume our proper places?"

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed dangerously as he finally comprehended why the Blackwoods had appeared unannounced that day. All pretense of politeness evaporated from his expression.

Instead of addressing Cassandra, he looked down at the woman in his arms, his voice laced with exasperation. "Why are you causing trouble when they're clearly the ones stirring the pot?"

Evelyn pouted. "I'm not causing trouble! You married the wrong woman! She's the one who waited for you in a wedding dress that day!"

"Enough," Nathaniel growled, though his anger seemed tempered when directed at Evelyn. His tone shifted to something resembling a patient teacher instructing a wayward student—firm yet careful not to frighten.

Evelyn's frown deepened, clearly displeased with his reaction.

Ignoring the brewing family drama, Nathaniel surprised everyone by asking softly, "What did you eat today?" The sudden appearance of uninvited guests had made him concerned about whether she'd had proper meals.

"A ham sandwich for breakfast," Evelyn answered truthfully. "Pasta at noon. Haven't had dinner yet." After her morning encounter with the Blackwoods, she'd remained upstairs where Theodore had discreetly delivered her meals.

Nathaniel's shoulders relaxed slightly at this confirmation. "Good. What would you like for dinner then?"

Cassandra's nails dug into her palms as she watched Nathaniel shower Evelyn with attention that should have been hers. Unable to contain herself any longer, she interjected sharply, "Mr. Grayson, perhaps it's best Evelyn leaves now while it's still daylight. If she stays for dinner, it'll be too late for her to travel safely with all her luggage."

Nathaniel's glacial stare finally turned to Cassandra. "If she leaves, you'll be escorted out as well."

Cassandra recoiled as if struck. "W-why? You were attracted to me once before, Mr. Grayson! Don't let Evelyn deceive you! She might play the innocent, but she's the most cunning schemer of all!"

Victoria chimed in anxiously, "My dear son-in-law, you must listen to your mother-in-law! There's been a terrible mistake—you were meant to marry Cassandra, not Evelyn!"

Gregory adopted his most authoritative tone. "Listen to me, son-in-law! My eldest daughter Cassandra was your intended bride. You mistakenly chose Evelyn on the wedding day! This is a misunderstanding we must rectify immediately!"
###Chapter 392

Nathaniel had heard countless times about Evelyn's difficult past, but he never imagined the extent of the cruelty she endured.

A stepmother and stepsister who treated her horribly was bad enough—but even her own father seemed indifferent to her suffering.

He glanced down at the composed young woman in his arms, his chest tightening. What kind of childhood must she have had to remain so unshaken in the face of such betrayal?

The Whitmores' absurd claims only drew a cold smirk from him.

"Why would I ever switch places with her? The woman I intended to marry has always been Evelyn—no one else."

Cassandra refused to believe it. She was convinced Evelyn had manipulated Nathaniel with lies.

"Mister Nathaniel, how could Evelyn possibly be the one you wanted to marry? She’s just saying whatever she can to trick you! It was me you chose! I even have the engagement ring you sent!"

She thrust out her hand, displaying the diamond ring on her finger.

Nathaniel barely spared it a glance, his expression unreadable.

Then, his fingers curled around Evelyn’s delicate hand, tracing the platinum band on her ring finger before lifting it for the Whitmores to see.

"Sorry, but this is the Grayson family’s heirloom engagement ring. I’ve never seen yours before."

Cassandra faltered. Years ago, a messenger from the Graysons had told her mother that "Miss Whitmore" had accepted Nathaniel’s proposal—and soon after, a diamond ring had arrived anonymously.

Who else could have sent it if not Nathaniel?

Her mind raced before she jabbed a finger at Evelyn. "She must have stolen it! She switched the rings somehow!"

Nathaniel’s gaze darkened with disdain. "Evelyn’s ring is forged from platinum and rare alloys—it can’t be removed without a special solvent. How exactly would she have stolen it from you?"

Cassandra’s mouth opened and closed wordlessly.

Nathaniel cradled Evelyn’s hand like it was priceless. "Besides, I placed this ring on her myself when we became engaged. Do you really think I’d mistake someone else for the woman I love?"

Engaged?! Cassandra’s face paled.

"No! That’s impossible!" she shrieked. "Mister Nathaniel, why would someone of your status ever fall for a nobody like Evelyn? A famous actress like me is far more suited to be your wife!"

Nathaniel arched a brow. "I have no idea where you got the delusion that I’d ever be interested in you."

Cassandra flinched but pressed on. "If you’d settle for a country girl like her, why not me? What does she have that I don’t?"

Someone in the crowd burst out laughing.
###Chapter 393

The sudden burst of laughter didn't come from Evelyn or Nathaniel. It was Theodore who couldn't contain himself any longer. Despite his years of service, he'd never encountered such an ordinary-looking woman with such outrageous confidence.

What a spectacle!

Clearing his throat awkwardly, Theodore composed himself. "My apologies, sir. I'll check if dinner is ready for you and Mrs. Grayson."

With that, he made a dignified exit.

Nathaniel's icy gaze settled on Cassandra. "Tell me, in what possible way could you compare to my wife? Your personality? Intelligence? Appearance? Can you even measure up to a single strand of her hair?"

His words struck Cassandra's pride like a slap. While she begrudgingly acknowledged Evelyn's beauty, she considered herself attractive enough to be a rising star in the entertainment industry.

'How dare Nathaniel dismiss me like this! Evelyn dresses like a peasant - what's so special about her?'

Victoria couldn't bear seeing her daughter humiliated. She stepped forward accusingly. "Why deny it now? You sent people to our home with the dowry, announcing your intention to marry our daughter! We prepared a grand banquet because of you!"

Her voice trembled with indignation. "Then you never showed, making our family the laughingstock of all our relatives! You owe us an explanation!"

Nathaniel's dark eyes lifted to meet the woman who dared call herself his 'mother-in-law'. "The Whitmores have more than one daughter. Did it never occur to you that dowry was meant for the youngest from the beginning?"

Victoria froze. When people mentioned 'the Whitmore daughter', she'd automatically assumed they meant Cassandra - her biological child. The thought it could be that country bumpkin Evelyn never crossed her mind.

Nathaniel's arm tightened around Evelyn's shoulders. With deliberate tenderness, he tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear. "You should understand - the only reason you're standing in this house is because you're related to my wife. Continue treating her poorly, and you'll lose even that privilege. She's better off without such a family."

His voice turned sharp as he called out, "Theodore! Escort them out."

The butler reappeared immediately, signaling several staff members to assist.

Panic flashed across Victoria's face. "Mr. Grayson, there's been a misunderstanding! Let's discuss this calmly-"

But the Grayson staff had endured the Whitmores' behavior all day. With their employer's clear instruction, they wasted no time in removing the unwanted guests.

As the servants dragged them away, Cassandra finally found her voice. "She tricked you, Nathaniel! I'm your real bride! Me! Not her!"

Gregory seized the moment to break free, scrambling back toward Nathaniel. All pretenses of dignity gone, he forced an ingratiating smile. "Mr. Grayson, whichever daughter you married, I'm still your father-in-law! That fact won't change!"
###Chapter 394

A glacial glint flashed in Nathaniel's eyes as Gregory's hypocritical words reached his ears.

'What kind of father is this man? What kind of upbringing did Evelyn endure?'

Nathaniel's voice dropped to a dangerous timbre. "First, prove yourself worthy of being Evelyn's father. Then, I might consider acknowledging you as my father-in-law. But given how utterly you've failed her, you don't even deserve basic human decency."

Gregory swallowed hard, guilt and pressure crushing him. He wanted to argue, but one look into Nathaniel's icy gaze paralyzed him with fear. The man before him was nothing like the respectful son-in-law he'd met before.

That first meeting had been cordial—Nathaniel had shown him courtesy. Now? Only ruthless disdain.

It hit Gregory then—his status meant nothing. The only reason he'd ever been tolerated was because of Evelyn. Without her, he wouldn't even be allowed past the gates of the Grayson estate.

As for Cassandra? Swapping her with Evelyn was impossible. Gregory was getting older, and though he despised groveling, he couldn't pass up the chance to be linked to the Graysons.

Forcing a paternal smile, he turned to Evelyn, voice dripping with false warmth. "Don't misunderstand, sweetheart. I had too much to drink before coming. Those words? Just drunken nonsense. Truth is, I was hurt you never came home."

His tone turned pleading. "I worried sick when you disappeared! The moment I heard you were here, I rushed over. Please, talk to your husband—don't let him throw his own father-in-law out!"

Evelyn, still wrapped in Nathaniel's arms, slowly turned to face him. The man was familiar, yet a stranger.

"You're Cassandra's father, not mine. You didn't come for me. You came to replace me with her."

Gregory's smile stiffened. Rage simmered beneath his skin at her defiance, but he forced a wider grin under Nathaniel's watchful gaze. "It's all a misunderstanding! No need for this hostility—we can work this out!"

Evelyn's lips curled into a mocking smile.

In that moment, she felt relief. A spineless coward like Gregory wasn't her real father. She refused to share his blood.

Ignoring him, she tilted her head toward Theodore, who stood waiting nearby. "You recognize them, don't you? Next time they show up, don't hold back."

Theodore bowed. "Understood, ma'am." With a sharp gesture, he summoned the staff to drag Gregory out—straight to where his wife and daughter waited.

Realizing his act had failed, Gregory snapped. He thrashed, cursing. "Evelyn! You ungrateful wretch! How dare you treat your own father this way? Mark my words—karma will destroy you!"

Nathaniel's expression darkened. No one insulted Evelyn.

A single glance at Theodore was all it took.

Gregory wouldn't leave unscathed.
###Chapter 395

Theodore understood Nathaniel's intentions immediately and turned to relay orders to the staff. As the last of the unwelcome visitors disappeared, Evelyn took a deep breath of clean air and pushed against the man's solid chest.

"Can you release me now?"

Nathaniel's grip only tightened as he looked down at her. "Let go of my fierce little kitten so she can grab her empty suitcase and storm out dramatically?"

Evelyn's brows knitted together. "Didn't you notice how light my luggage was? It's completely empty! The whole packing thing was just an act!"

While Nathaniel had noticed the suspicious weightlessness earlier, his expression remained stern. "Why didn't you call me when they showed up?"

She shrugged nonchalantly. "You were working. I didn't want to interrupt, and honestly, those nobodies weren't worth your time. I could've chased them off myself, but they'd just keep coming back until they heard it from you directly."

Her lips curved knowingly. "I know exactly how their minds work. So I played along, pretended to pack, and kept them here until you returned to deliver the final blow."

Nathaniel studied her with an unreadable expression. "Should I thank you for being so considerate of my schedule?"

Evelyn flashed him a cheeky grin. "No need for gratitude! I completely understand where your priorities lie."

His hand came down on her head with mock severity. "What priorities? From this moment forward, anything concerning you is my top priority. Next time, call me immediately."

The unexpected declaration sent Evelyn's thoughts scattering. She nodded obediently. "Fine. Next time, I'll call."

Theodore returned from dispatching staff to deal with the Whitmore family, his face lighting up at the sight of Nathaniel holding Evelyn. The young mistress had won over the entire household with her unpretentious nature and genuine kindness - qualities sorely lacking in the arrogant Cassandra he'd once feared might become the lady of the house.

"Sir, dinner will be ready shortly. Any special requests for you or Miss Evelyn?"

Nathaniel's gaze swept across the living and dining areas, his nose wrinkling in distaste. "Cancel dinner here. We're going out. Have the entire house disinfected."

"At once, sir." Theodore had already planned extensive cleaning - the Whitmores' presence had polluted the very air.

Nathaniel turned back to Evelyn. "Wait here while I change. We're going out."

Her eyes sparkled with curiosity. "Where to?"

His large hand ruffled her hair affectionately. "That's a surprise."

Evelyn pouted playfully, wondering what scheme her mysterious husband had concocted this time.
###Chapter 396

Evelyn settled onto the couch, idly scrolling through her phone while waiting for Nathaniel to finish changing. The minutes dragged by, and she tapped absently at a puzzle game to distract herself.

A half-hour later, his voice cut through the silence. "Ready. Let's go."

She glanced up—and froze.

Nathaniel stood before her in casual attire, a rare sight. Gone were the sharp lines of his tailored suits and polished dress shoes. His hair, usually styled with precision, now fell in loose waves, softening the intensity of his features. The effect was startling—youthful, almost disarming.

"Done staring?" He stepped closer, tapping her forehead lightly.

Evelyn blinked, rubbing the spot with a frown before shoving her phone into her pocket.

"Can't I look?" she countered.

He arched a brow. "If you like looking so much, why banish me to the study every night?" A smirk played at his lips. "Let me stay in your room tonight, and you can look all you want. Deal?"

Heat rushed to her cheeks. She stood abruptly, feigning indifference. "I was just thinking you look younger like this. Don't flatter yourself."

Nathaniel's expression darkened. "Are you saying I usually look old?"

Evelyn didn't hesitate. "Why do you think I call you mister?"

His gaze dropped. He leaned in, tilting her chin up with a finger. "If I'm not so old now, shouldn't you call me something else?"

She pretended to consider it. Then, brightly: "I'm starving, bro. Let's go."

Bro?

Nathaniel exhaled sharply, pinching the bridge of his nose. Any other woman would have melted at that moment—but not her. With a resigned shake of his head, he followed her out.

Instead of summoning a driver, Nathaniel took the wheel of a sleek sports car, navigating toward a secluded villa nestled in the hills.

Evelyn stepped out, inhaling the crisp mountain air. The scent of grilled meat drifted from the villa, making her stomach growl. Before she could ask whose home this was, Nathaniel clasped her hand, leading her inside.

The yard was immaculate—manicured hedges, stone pathways, an understated elegance that spoke of wealth and taste. Then she spotted Dominic by the grill, sleeves rolled up, basting skewers with practiced ease.

He grinned at their approach. "Look who finally showed up—Nathaniel and the missus!"

Evelyn's gaze flicked past him to the floor-to-ceiling windows, where a lively crowd mingled inside. This wasn't just a casual get-together.

She crossed her arms. "What's the occasion?"

Dominic winked. "Your boy Dom's thirtieth. Figured we'd celebrate low-key."

"Happy birthday, then," she said dryly.

"Thanks." He extended a hand, palm up. "Where's my gift?"

Evelyn stared.

How was I supposed to know this was a birthday party?
###Chapter 397

Evelyn's cheeks burned with embarrassment. She scowled and turned to Nathaniel, whispering sharply, "This is your fault! Showing up empty-handed to a birthday party is beyond awkward, and it's all because you didn't warn me!"

Nathaniel didn't seem fazed by her irritation. He plucked a skewer of grilled meat from the barbecue, took a deliberate bite, then handed it to her.

"You never gave me a birthday present," he countered smoothly. "Why should I let you give one to someone else?"

Evelyn gaped at him, momentarily speechless. She snatched the skewer from his hand. For all his maturity, Nathaniel had a petty streak when it came to the smallest things.

True, she had intended to give him a gift—until she saw him embracing Amelia at Silver Moon Estate. Sophia had even dragged her shopping for it. But that moment had soured everything, and the present had ended up in the trash.

Nathaniel tossed his car keys to Dominic. "Here. Your gift."

Dominic caught them midair, staring in disbelief as if he'd been handed a royal decree. "You're serious? You're actually giving me this beauty?"

"Don't want it?"

Dominic shoved the keys into his pocket instantly. "Hell yes, I want it! You're a saint, and I'm not giving it back!"

Evelyn tugged Nathaniel aside, hissing, "A used car? That's your idea of a birthday gift? What kind of friend does that?"

Nathaniel smirked, ruffling her hair. "There's nothing money can't buy him—except this. It's a limited-edition model, one of a kind. He's been begging me for it for years. I only parted with it today because of you."

Evelyn nearly choked. The man could spin anything into being her fault.

Still, the car was a collector's item, practically untouched since Nathaniel preferred his MPV. And Dominic had been drooling over it forever. Maybe it wasn't such a terrible gift.

She crossed her arms. "And how exactly are we getting home now that you've given away our ride?"

Nathaniel shrugged. "You can take me on the subway."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Use your brain! We're in the middle of nowhere. The nearest station is two hours away, with who knows how many transfers. And if we miss the last bus—"

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. Did she just call me stupid?

Dominic, eavesdropping while flipping chicken wings, couldn't resist chiming in. "Relax, you two. If you get stranded, my guest room has a very spacious bed. Plenty of room for... activities."

Evelyn's face flamed. "You can keep your activities to yourself!"

Nathaniel shot him a glacial glare. "Focus on not burning the food."

Dominic wisely shut his mouth. Note to self: don't poke the bear.

"Nathaniel! Get up here for a drink!"

A voice called from the second-floor balcony. Nathaniel glanced up to see Jonathan waving at him. Beside him sat Harrison, Samuel, and—Evelyn's stomach twisted—Amelia. All of them watching.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Your fan club's waiting."
###Chapter 398

Nathaniel glanced up at the balcony crowd before draping his arm around Evelyn's shoulders to guide her upstairs.

Evelyn planted her feet firmly. "I'm staying right here for those wings. No interest in mingling with your fancy friends."

He didn't push, just ruffled her hair affectionately. "Fine. Enjoy your snack. I'll make quick rounds upstairs then come straight back."

She gave a thumbs-up and took a satisfying bite of the perfectly grilled skewer he'd handed her.

As Nathaniel disappeared inside, Dominic passed Evelyn a plate piled high with barbecue wings, his smirk knowing. "Impressive how you've tamed the legendary Nathaniel Grayson into such an obedient puppy."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "You're the weird one here. Throwing your own birthday party just to play chef for everyone. Don't you ever get tired of being a martyr?"

Dominic froze mid-motion, his striking eyes locking onto hers with sudden intensity.

"Everyone else just cares about the food. You're the first to ask if I'm okay." His voice dropped dramatically. "I'm genuinely touched."

He abruptly dropped his tongs and moved to embrace her. Evelyn sidestepped just in time, nose wrinkling in disgust.

Undeterred by the failed hug, Dominic's grin widened. "You're absolutely right! Those ungrateful leeches are stuffing their faces while I slave away. Be a darling and watch the grill? Just need a quick bathroom break."

Evelyn saw right through his escape plan but agreed anyway—small price to avoid awkward socializing inside. She took over grill duties, meticulously basting the sizzling wings.

'If those social butterflies stay occupied,' she mused, 'maybe I'll get to keep all these perfectly crisped wings to myself.'

"Evelyn!"

The sudden voice made her jump. Benjamin stood across the grill, his usual haughty expression firmly in place—that perpetual look like she'd personally offended his ancestors.

She raised an eyebrow. "Finished your homework before coming to play, kiddo?"

His frown deepened at the patronizing tone. "It's all done!"

"Good for you. Run along then." She turned her attention back to the grill.

Benjamin lingered awkwardly, opening and closing his mouth several times before blurting out, "About last time... My brother's usually reasonable. He just... loses it when someone mentions Luna."

Evelyn took a deliberate bite of chicken. "Fascinating."

"Are you... still mad at me?" His voice held uncharacteristic vulnerability.

She shrugged. "Why would I be?"
###Chapter 399

Evelyn noticed Benjamin's relieved expression and mentally rolled her eyes. At least he wasn't making this more awkward than it needed to be.

She turned her attention back to the sizzling chicken wings, deliberately ignoring his nervous fidgeting.

Benjamin ran a hand through his hair, cheeks flushing. "Listen, Evelyn... I think I've started developing feelings for you."

The barbecue tongs froze mid-flip. Evelyn lifted an incredulous gaze, meeting his earnest expression with raised eyebrows. "That's... flattering, I suppose?"

His face fell. "That's all you have to say?"

"What exactly were you expecting?" She resumed fanning the coals, watching the flames lick at the marinated wings.

Benjamin's hands clenched at his sides. "I'm pouring my heart out here! This isn't some joke!"

Evelyn smirked without looking up. "Let me guess - this sudden confession has nothing to do with helping your sister eliminate competition for Nathaniel's attention?"

He crossed his arms defensively. "Okay, maybe that was part of it initially. But something's changed! When I see you now, I don't get that annoyed feeling anymore. It's... different."

A dry chuckle escaped Evelyn's lips.

'Teenagers and their dramatic proclamations,' she thought. 'Not hating someone suddenly equals romance? Please.'

"Benjamin," came Amelia's melodic voice from behind them.

He spun around, concern immediately replacing his frustration. "Amelia! You'll catch a chill dressed like that!"

Without hesitation, Benjamin shrugged off his jacket and draped it over his sister's shoulders despite her protests.

"Stop being stubborn," he insisted. "I won't have you getting sick."

Amelia surrendered with an affectionate sigh before turning her attention to Evelyn. "Why didn't you join Nathaniel inside after arriving?"

Evelyn kept her eyes on the grill. "Crowded places aren't really my thing."

Noticing Evelyn's focus on the food, Amelia nudged her brother. "Aren't you going to help? Gentlemen don't let ladies handle all the grilling work alone."

Benjamin obediently rolled up his sleeves. "Step aside, Evelyn. I'll take over from here."

She hesitated, protective of her culinary efforts. "Do you even know what you're doing?"

"Hey, I'm practically a grill master!" he boasted. "My friends always request my barbecue at gatherings."

Evelyn finally relinquished the tongs. "Fine. Let's see if you live up to the hype."

Just as Benjamin prepared to impress her, Amelia looped her arm through Evelyn's. "Leave him to it. Come, let's chat in the gazebo. You deserve a break."
###Chapter 400

Evelyn had no affection for Amelia nor any desire to converse with her, yet the woman's persistent gaze suggested unspoken words.

Still, facing Amelia directly seemed preferable to enduring her covert schemes. Evelyn withdrew her arm, smoothing invisible wrinkles from her sleeves. A faint smirk played on her lips as she nodded. "Let's talk then."

Amelia's expression faltered. That deliberate withdrawal spoke volumes - Evelyn rejected even casual contact. Amelia's doe eyes blinked rapidly, projecting wounded innocence as if bewildered by the perceived slight.

They moved to the garden gazebo. Amelia spoke first. "I've noticed Nathaniel's been particularly attentive to you lately."

Evelyn anticipated tedious small talk. She grabbed two meat skewers before joining Amelia, chewing as she replied, "Has he?"

A bitter smile twisted Amelia's lips. "Quite obviously. You must be thrilled with his sudden devotion."

Evelyn swallowed before responding bluntly, "I don't feel anything remarkable about it."

Amelia's smile turned wistful. "I was like that once with Nathaniel. Every day felt magical. Such a pity how fickle men are - new women make them forget past affections."

Evelyn froze mid-bite. She turned sharply, brows furrowing. "When exactly were you two involved?"

Amelia covered her mouth in feigned realization. "Oh! Nathaniel never told you? My apologies, Evelyn. Pretend you didn't hear that."

Evelyn smiled coolly. "Consider it forgotten." She resumed eating without further inquiry.

Amelia gaped. Most women would demand details about their lover's ex. "Aren't you curious about our history?"

"Intensely," Evelyn said between bites, tone casual. "But I'll ask Nathaniel directly. No need to trouble yourself."

Amelia's eyes widened before adopting a pitying look. "How naive. If he hasn't volunteered the truth by now, why would he when asked?"

"Because he will," Evelyn stated with absolute certainty, her expression unshaken.

Amelia momentarily faltered before recovering. "You understand men poorly. They always prioritize current relationships over past ones. Admitting old flames would only upset their new partners."

Evelyn arched a brow. "So Nathaniel's just another faithless scoundrel to you? Why pine after him then?"

The barb landed. Amelia stiffened before countering, "Since we're being honest - I don't just like Nathaniel, I love him! All men are fundamentally the same. Do you truly believe in male fidelity?"

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. "That indictment includes your father and brothers. Are they equally untrustworthy?"

Amelia sighed dramatically. "I'm not condemning, just stating facts. My father had multiple wives. Even my 'virtuous' brother keeps company with various women. Men inevitably lose interest, no matter how remarkable their partner."

"Ah," Evelyn nodded in realization. "This is a warning. Prepare for when Nathaniel tires of me? Or better yet, leave now to avoid heartbreak?"

Amelia smiled beatifically. "I'm relieved you understand, Evelyn."
###Chapter 401

Evelyn let out a soft laugh. "Not at all. If I leave and you return to Nathaniel, aren't you worried he'll lose interest in you too once he grows tired of playing games?"

Amelia's expression shifted to one of arrogant superiority mixed with pity. "That's precisely where we differ, Evelyn."

Evelyn raised an eyebrow. "Oh? Do enlighten me."

"My family stands equal to the Graysons in status. My parents adore me—they'd move heaven and earth to protect me. My brothers would tear apart anyone who dares cross me." Amelia tilted her chin higher. "You don't have that kind of safety net, do you?"

The amusement vanished from Evelyn's face as realization struck. "It was you. You're the one who told the Whitmores about my marriage to Nathaniel."

Amelia didn't deny it. "Guilty as charged."

Evelyn's voice remained steady. "Did you honestly think sending my estranged family after me would make me abandon Nathaniel?"

The sweet facade Amelia usually wore shattered completely, revealing the cold aristocrat beneath.

"Of course not. I simply wanted you to understand your place. You're a nobody who married above your station. Eventually, everyone will see you for the gold-digger you are."

She smoothed her designer blouse. "I, however, have nothing to fear. The Graysons wouldn't dare mistreat someone of my standing. Even if things with Nathaniel end badly, my family will ensure I land on my feet."

Evelyn's lips curved into a humorless smile. "So your entire confidence stems from hiding behind your family's skirts?"

"Isn't that obvious?" Amelia scoffed.

Evelyn crossed her arms. "I'll admit I lack such...privileges. But I don't need them. I've never relied on anyone's protection. The only true security is being able to stand on your own."

She took a step closer. "I'm with Nathaniel because I choose to be—not for his name or wealth. If either of us loses interest, we'll walk away as equals."

Her gaze turned icy. "Save your schemes, Amelia. Keep playing these games and that perfect princess act of yours will crumble. Then who'll pamper you?"

Turning on her heel, Evelyn headed toward the barbecue pit.

"Wait!" Amelia grabbed her arm. "There's something you need to see."

With dramatic flair, she lifted her blouse to reveal a pale scar across her abdomen.

Evelyn frowned. "Appendectomy?"

Amelia's eyes flashed with fury. "It's a cesarean scar."

Evelyn froze, staring at the woman who couldn't be older than herself. "You have a child?"

Amelia's smile turned triumphant. "Nathaniel's child."

"What?"
###Chapter 402

Evelyn released her grip on Amelia's sleeve and smoothed out her own clothes before lifting her chin defiantly. Her piercing gaze held both pity and challenge. "Nathaniel never mentioned we have a child together, did he? Still so confident about trusting him blindly?"

The corners of Evelyn's eyes tightened slightly. "How old were you when you got pregnant? Where is this child now?"

Seeing Evelyn's sudden interest in details, Amelia knew she'd struck a nerve. A triumphant smirk played on her lips. "I thought you claimed to trust Nathaniel completely? Why not ask him yourself? Though I doubt he'd admit the truth even if you did."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow, feigning curiosity. "Fine, let's say I believe you. If you two share a child and are so in love, why not marry? The Graysons are desperate for an heir. What possible reason could there be to hide this?"

A shadow crossed Amelia's face as painful memories surfaced. "Surely you're aware of the century-old feud between the Rivers and Graysons. Our families would never approve. If they'd discovered my pregnancy..." Her voice dropped to a whisper. "They would have forced me to terminate. Neither family would allow a child bearing both bloodlines to exist."

She lifted her chin with forced dignity. "Nathaniel protected me by sending me abroad. He arranged everything - ensured no one, especially our families, learned about the pregnancy or birth. Why do you think I disappeared overseas for over a year?"

Evelyn's brow furrowed. "You still haven't told me where this child is."

Amelia's expression turned mournful, the picture of a grieving mother. "My baby was weaned and left with caretakers overseas. Nathaniel promised to resolve the family feud so he could officially bring us home." Her voice cracked. "But then his grandfather demanded he marry immediately. You were just... convenient."

A bitter laugh escaped her. "I'm not surprised he's distracted by you. Men always chase novelty. But I'm the mother of his child - that fact won't change. When he tires of playing house, he'll return to me. I saved his life and gave him an heir. You're just temporary entertainment."

Evelyn listened impassively before nodding. "Fascinating story. Anything else? If not, I have chicken wings waiting." She turned to leave.

Amelia gaped in disbelief. 'What kind of woman prioritizes food after learning her husband fathered a child?' Spotting movement from the villa, she suddenly lunged forward, grabbing Evelyn's arm.

Evelyn spun around, annoyed. "What now, Amelia?"

Without warning, Amelia dropped to her knees. "I'm sorry! Please don't be angry!" Then she flung herself backward as if violently kicked, landing hard on the pavement with a pained whimper. "I apologized... why would you hurt me, Evelyn?" Her voice trembled with theatrical anguish.
###Chapter 403

Evelyn stared at Amelia in utter bewilderment as the other woman dramatically collapsed onto the cobblestones, clutching her knees with theatrical flair.

Nathaniel's tall frame emerged from the villa's entrance just as Samuel rushed forward, shoving Evelyn aside with unnecessary force. "Back off! What the hell are you doing to my sister?" he snarled.

Before Evelyn could utter a word of explanation, Samuel had already knelt to help Amelia up with exaggerated concern. "Are you hurt?" His voice dripped with false worry.

The impact sent Evelyn stumbling backward. She fought to regain balance but her heel caught on the uneven pathway. With a startled gasp, she plunged into the ornamental koi pond.

Though shallow, the mountain-chilled water stole her breath. She surfaced spluttering, hair plastered to her face like a drowned alley cat.

A shadow loomed over the pond's edge. Nathaniel didn't hesitate - he leapt in, boots sinking into the silt as he waded toward her. Strong arms lifted her dripping form from the water. "I've got you," he murmured, stripping off his suit jacket to wrap around her shaking shoulders.

"F-f-freezing," Evelyn chattered through clenched teeth.

Nathaniel cradled her against his chest, water dripping from both their clothes. "Let's get you inside before you catch pneumonia."

Samuel watched the scene unfold with a sneer. "Before you play white knight, you should know your little girlfriend was about to stomp on Amelia's face when I intervened."

Evelyn's jaw tightened. The accusation hung in the air like poison.

Nathaniel's gaze flicked to Amelia, who leaned heavily against her brother. "Is this true? Are you injured?"

Amelia fluttered her lashes, pressing a delicate hand to her chest. "It's nothing, Nathaniel. Please don't blame Evelyn. I... I probably deserved it."

The muscles in Nathaniel's jaw twitched as he studied Evelyn's pale face. "Explain."

Evelyn wrenched herself free, landing unsteadily on her feet. "No cameras. No witnesses. Just their word against mine." Her laugh held no humor. "Call the police if you want. Have me arrested again. Wouldn't be the first time false accusations landed me in cuffs."

She turned toward the villa, shoulders squared against the biting wind. Hypothermia wasn't worth this charade. Let Nathaniel believe whatever he wanted - she was done defending herself to people determined to see her as the villain.
###Chapter 404

The villa's living room buzzed with lively chatter until Evelyn Whitmore stepped inside. Every head turned toward her, curious gazes dissecting her appearance.

"Who is she? Why's she barging in like this?"

"Is that wet t-shirt look supposed to be seductive?"

"Please, she's wearing denim shorts. How's that seductive?"

"Damn though, she's gorgeous."

"Who brought her? Haven't seen her all night."

Their whispers followed Evelyn as she scanned the room, completely unfazed. She had one mission - find Dominic Prescott, the villa's owner, and beg for dry clothes.

But Dominic had vanished after his supposed bathroom break. No sign of him anywhere downstairs. "Aren't you supposed to be the birthday boy?" Evelyn muttered under her breath.

Across the room, Christopher Ashford set down his wine glass mid-conversation. His calculating gaze tracked Evelyn's movements as he approached. "What happened, Evelyn? You're soaked."

Evelyn turned at the familiar voice. Christopher looked every bit the aristocrat - perfectly sculpted brows, lips like crushed roses, teeth gleaming white. His movements carried rehearsed grace, each gesture measured for maximum effect.

"Kind Sir! Perfect timing for you to prove that nickname." Despite her drenched state, Evelyn's composure never wavered. "Tell me you brought female company tonight."

Christopher blinked at the unexpected moniker but answered honestly. "Just my assistant waiting in the car. Need me to ask about spare clothes?"

"Yes, please. Desperately." Evelyn tugged at her clinging shirt.

"Consider it done." Christopher pulled out his phone. "Angela? Bring your emergency outfit to the villa immediately." He smirked after hanging up. "Lucky you. She always packs extras."

Evelyn flashed a grateful smile. "My hero, Kind Sir."

The nickname drew amused chuckles from nearby guests.

"Look! Christopher's talking to that drowned rat!"

"Since when does he associate with common girls?"

"Upper-class daughters only, that's his rule."

"Doesn't matter how pretty she is - no pedigree, no chance."

"Her clothes look straight off a clearance rack."

"Seriously, what's so special about her?"

Dominic had kept his birthday intimate - close friends and select acquaintances. The extra women were just decorative additions brought by his male guests to liven things up.
###Chapter 405

The gossipers were mostly female companions brought by the male guests.

Among them were struggling actresses, D-list socialites, and daughters of minor business families.

Jonathan's expression darkened at their cruel whispers. He shot them a warning glare before turning to Evelyn. "It's crowded here. Let's go upstairs. I'll get you a towel for your hair."

"Thanks."

Evelyn accepted immediately, eager to escape the judgmental stares. Soon, they were ascending the grand staircase together.

As they walked, Jonathan studied Evelyn's profile thoughtfully. "Where's Nathaniel? Why did you arrive alone?"

Her face remained impassive. "Outside. Probably still fussing over his precious Amelia."

The subtle edge in her voice made Jonathan smirk. "Trouble in paradise because of her?"

Evelyn's tone turned icy. "Not at all. I completely understand his concern for his savior. No awkwardness here."

Jonathan raised an eyebrow, unconvinced. "Nathaniel's always been... attentive to Amelia. Before you came along, most of us assumed they'd marry eventually."

Evelyn's fingers twitched. 'Marry? So even his friends thought they were together?'

"Knowing Nathaniel," Jonathan continued, "he'd feel obligated to repay a life debt. The way he's pampered Amelia these years? Even I found it excessive. Though..." He gave Evelyn a knowing look. "I'd understand if his wife found it hard to swallow."

Evelyn stayed silent. Jealous? No. Furious? Absolutely.

Nathaniel's accusatory tone still burned. After everything, he'd actually believed Lucas's ridiculous claims. She'd thought he knew her better than that.

Amelia's two-faced act disgusted her, but Evelyn would never resort to such petty schemes. The woman wasn't worth her time or energy - yet Amelia kept forcing herself into Evelyn's life like an annoying gnat.

Jonathan led her to an empty guest suite and produced a fresh towel. "Dry off here. This is Dominic's largest guest room. The place stays vacant but gets cleaned weekly. Everything's sterilized - no hygiene concerns."

He explained each detail meticulously, watching her reaction closely.
###Chapter 406

"Thank you."

Evelyn had always been the pragmatic type, so sharing a towel didn't faze her. She accepted the proffered towel without hesitation, first wiping her face before roughly drying her damp hair.

Jonathan watched her with amusement. Despite his usual teasing nature, he knew better than to overstep boundaries now. The man who'd once tormented her with barbed jokes had transformed into the picture of chivalry.

"Evelyn, rest here while I have my assistant bring you fresh clothes."

"Fine. Thanks again, Sir Gallant!"

Evelyn had no intention of letting him linger. As a married woman, being alone with another man—even in a guest room—was crossing lines she wouldn't tolerate. Distance was necessary.

Jonathan's lips twitched at the ridiculous nickname. "If you're truly grateful, use my name instead of mocking titles."

Evelyn arched one brow. "Mocking? I think 'Sir Gallant' perfectly captures your heroic nature today."

"It sounds sarcastic."

"Not at all," Evelyn countered seriously. "I genuinely appreciate your help. Though we both know you're only doing this because of Nathaniel. Otherwise, I'd be stuck in wet clothes."

Jonathan's smile faltered. His forehead creased. "That's not true. I helped because it's you. Nathaniel has nothing to do with this. Aren't we friends regardless?"

Evelyn studied his striking features for a beat before nodding. "Fine. Consider us friends from today. Now—Jonathan—get out. I need to dry off, and friendship doesn't entitle you to see me naked."

She physically propelled him toward the door—a comical sight given their size difference. The towering man nearly tripped over his own feet as the petite woman shoved him out unceremoniously.

The door slammed shut. Jonathan stared at it, torn between irritation and amusement. 'Still the same stubborn woman.'

Her hesitation before calling them friends hadn't escaped him. That reluctant nod spoke volumes. 'She tolerates me at best. Evelyn Whitmore, you're as fascinating as ever. Names change, but your spirit doesn't.'

Turning, he spotted his assistant approaching with a garment bag. "Mr. Blake, the clothes you requested." Her curious gaze flicked to the closed door. "May I ask why you needed women's attire?"

"A friend had an unfortunate encounter with the pond," Jonathan said lightly. "Deliver these to her and bill accounting."

The assistant waved him off. "Consider it a gift. They weren't expensive."

Before she could move, a large hand intercepted the bag. "I'll take those."
###Chapter 407

That hand didn't belong to Christopher.

Sophia Bennett gasped. Her eyes lifted to meet Nathaniel Grayson's icy stare. His sudden, dominating presence made her instinctively step back.

"M-Mister Nathaniel!"

Nathaniel wordlessly opened the shopping bag, inspecting the clothes. The tags still attached confirmed they were new.

'These will have to do.'

Christopher flashed a smile. "Nathaniel, you made it."

Nathaniel gave a curt nod. "Where's my wife?"

"She's inside—completely soaked. I took her to the guest room to dry off before she catches a cold."

"Appreciate it." Nathaniel's eyes narrowed. "Though next time, think twice before taking another man's wife into a private room. Your help creates more problems than it solves."

Christopher's smile faltered, then returned with a dry chuckle. "Had no choice. She looked like a drowned kitten wandering around. Besides, if you'd prioritized your wife over your so-called savior, I wouldn't have needed to intervene. Don't you agree?"

Nathaniel's gaze darkened. After a tense pause, he replied, "Our marriage isn't open for your commentary. You know nothing about what's really happening."

Christopher shrugged. "Fair enough. My bad for prying."

Without another word, Nathaniel slid off his luxury watch and handed it to Sophia.

"I'm short on cash. Consider this payment for the clothes. It's worth more, but if it's insufficient, visit Grayson Enterprises tomorrow. My assistant will compensate you further."

He turned sharply and headed for the guest room where Evelyn waited.

Sophia stared dumbfounded at the Rolex in her palm—a rare 100th Anniversary edition. Its value dwarfed the clothes she'd given Evelyn. This single timepiece exceeded what she'd earn in multiple lifetimes.

She clutched it nervously, turning to Christopher. "Mister Christopher, this watch... Mister Nathaniel—"

"Keep it," Christopher said distractedly. "Its value will appreciate. Sell it later if you prefer."

Sophia examined the watch, curiosity piqued. "That woman who fell in the pond... She's really Nathaniel Grayson's wife?"

"Indeed."

"But I heard he married some nobody. How does an ordinary woman command that level of devotion? He just traded a fortune for her dry clothes."

Christopher's lips curved knowingly. "Oh, she's anything but ordinary."

Sophia blinked in confusion. Something was off about Christopher today. His usual detached demeanor had given way to something far more unsettling—an almost predatory glint in his eyes.
###Chapter 408

Nathaniel stepped into the guest room and found Evelyn standing by the bed, her back to the door as she towel-dried her damp hair.

Her unbuttoned blouse slipped halfway down her shoulders, revealing the delicate curve of her collarbone, the elegant slope of her neck, and the smooth expanse of her back—parts of her he’d never seen before, not even in the privacy of their home.

She didn’t even lock the door. What if it hadn’t been me? Does she not care who sees her like this?

The thought twisted his expression into a scowl, his jaw tightening as irritation flared.

Evelyn, hearing the door open, didn’t turn. "Thanks, Christopher. Just leave the clothes on the shelf."

She didn’t even bother to look. Unbelievable.

His frown deepened. She needs to learn some caution.

With a sharp click, he locked the door.

"Who exactly are you thanking?" His voice was low, edged with displeasure.

Evelyn froze mid-motion before turning. Shock flickered across her face for only a second before she schooled her features.

"Mister Grayson. What are you doing here?"

"You sound disappointed."

He strode toward her, and she hastily buttoned her damp blouse.

"No, I just thought you were Christopher."

Her quick attempt to cover herself only fueled his irritation.

She’s fine being half-dressed with the door unlocked, but the moment I walk in, she acts like I’m the one she needs to hide from?

He tossed the shopping bag onto the bed, his tone clipped. "Stop drying off. Take a hot shower first. Then dry your hair properly and change."

Evelyn bristled at his tone. She hadn’t done anything wrong, but arguing while soaked wasn’t worth it. Without a word, she turned and retreated into the bathroom.

Why is he lecturing me like I’m the problem?

Ten minutes later, she peeked out, wrapped in a towel. "Mister Grayson, where are my clothes?"

Nathaniel exhaled a slow stream of smoke from the sofa, his gaze dark as he gestured toward the bed. "There. Are you coming out to get them, or do I need to bring them to you?"

She rolled her eyes, then shuffled out, clutching the towel tightly. Snatching the bag, she hurried back inside, locking the bathroom door behind her.

The dress inside was a deep wine-red silk, a V-neck spaghetti strap design meant to hug every curve—except it was slightly too big for her slender frame.

Emerging with the towel draped over her damp hair, she frowned. "Where did you get this?"

Nathaniel looked up—and his breath caught.

The dress clung to her in all the right places, the rich color making her skin glow. She was breathtaking, and the rare sight of her in something so undeniably sensual sent heat rushing through his veins.
###Chapter 409

Nathaniel snapped out of his thoughts and tapped his cigarette against the ashtray. "Jonathan's secretary gave it to me."

Evelyn tilted her head. "Why didn't she just bring it in herself?"

"I ran into her outside," Nathaniel answered with a shrug, keeping his explanation brief.

Evelyn nodded absently, towel-drying her hair as she moved toward the bed to check her phone.

"Come here."

Nathaniel stubbed out his cigarette and crooked a finger at her.

Evelyn's nose wrinkled in distaste. She was still mad at him and had no intention of getting close. But giving him the silent treatment wasn't her style either. After a brief internal debate, she set her phone down and approached.

"What do you want?"

He patted his thigh. "Sit."

Evelyn's eyes widened. 'Is he seriously expecting me to sit on his lap? No way—that's way too intimate.'

She took two steps forward but veered left, aiming to circle around the sofa instead.

Nathaniel anticipated her move. His arm shot out, pulling her down onto his lap before she could escape.

"Let go!" She squirmed, pushing against his chest like an offended cat refusing to be petted.

His arm tightened around her slender waist, trapping her effortlessly. "Stop struggling. I'm not going to bite."

Evelyn scoffed, shooting him a glare. "Like I'd believe that."

The way her cheeks puffed up amused him. He loosened his grip slightly, one hand gently stroking her damp hair. "Behave. Now tell me—why didn't you wait for me to come in with you?"

"Because I was freezing!" she huffed. "I'd have turned into an icicle waiting for you."

Nathaniel's expression softened. He pulled her closer. "Sorry. Are you mad at me?"

Evelyn didn't sugarcoat it. "Furious."

That directness was something he appreciated about her. No guessing games, no hidden meanings—just pure, unfiltered honesty.

"Because I didn't come in with you?"

"No."

"Then what did I do wrong?"

She turned in his arms to face him properly, eyes blazing. "Asking 'what happened' like that! Really, Nathaniel? You actually thought I'd harass your precious savior? Do you really see me as some villain?"

'Ah. So that's it.'

He pinched her cheek playfully. "Don't be ridiculous. You're my wife—why would I think that? I wasn't there. I needed to hear your side before dealing with the idiots accusing you."

Evelyn's frown lessened slightly—for about three seconds before returning full force. Nope, still mad.

"Who else should I have asked?" he murmured, brushing a wet strand from her face. "Why would I believe strangers over you?"

She crossed her arms with a pout. "You're being ridiculous right now, you know that?"
###Chapter 410

Nathaniel ran his fingers through Evelyn's hair, treating her like a pampered kitten.

"I'm just stating facts. You know Amelia saved my life, so I'm obligated to give her a proper explanation. I wouldn't bother for anyone else. Earlier, I wanted to stay with you but Amelia suddenly got sick and kept calling for me, so I-"

Evelyn cut him off with an eye roll. "Save it. I know where this is going."

One dark eyebrow arched. "Do you? Enlighten me then."

She straightened in his lap, chin lifted. "I get your dilemma. Amelia's your savior who sacrificed something priceless for you. You feel indebted. So whenever she's in trouble, you can't just walk away. Am I wrong?"

Nathaniel didn't deny it. "Exactly. Just give me time to repay this debt. After that, I promise you'll never have to deal with this again."

Some weight lifted from Evelyn's chest after speaking her mind. "It's fine. As long as you trust me, I won't stay angry. Repaying a life debt is understandable. I get it and I trust you."

His brows knitted together as he glared. "Little minx, you know I wouldn't mind if you took your anger out on me."

She smirked. "I won't. I'm not that petty."

Darkness clouded his eyes. "But I am. So what should we do about that?"

"Petty about what? I didn't do anything to you," Evelyn countered, confused.

His expression darkened. "Wasn't Jonathan in here with you earlier?"

Evelyn nodded calmly. "Since he's your friend, I asked him to bring me clothes. He just dropped me off to rest and left after handing me a towel."

Nathaniel searched her eyes intently.

"No need to explain. I know nothing happened. But let me be clear - I don't like you getting cozy with other men. Next time, I can't promise I'll keep my temper."

"That's rich," Evelyn shot back. "You don't seem to mind me watching you with other women. Evelyn Whitmore, sometimes I wonder if you'd be just as content without me."

She blinked innocently. "Nathaniel... Are you saying you feel insecure in this relationship? That I'd leave you in a heartbeat?"

He glared. "Yes! Exactly that. Every damn day I worry you'll run off with someone else." His grip tightened painfully around her waist.

Evelyn winced. "Nathaniel... You're not off the hook yet. Have some self-respect and stop manhandling me."

Unfazed, he tickled her ribs. "You're my wife. I'll handle you however I please."

She squirmed, trying to ignore the tingling sensation. "Fake wife! We don't even have a marriage certificate."

His eyes lit up at the reminder. "Shall we fix that tomorrow?"

Evelyn's cheeks burned. "Don't twist my words! I wasn't suggesting that."

He leaned in until his breath warmed her skin. "I want to. Do you? It would mean everything to me."

Her pulse raced as their faces nearly touched. She shoved him away. "Stop joking about serious things."

"I'm dead serious."

"Not tomorrow. Maybe someday. First I need to evaluate if you're even husband material."

Nathaniel knew convincing her wouldn't be easy. He chuckled ruefully. "Take your time. Sooner or later, you'll be mine."

The predatory glint in his eyes made her shiver. Without realizing, her dress strap had slipped down her arm.
###Chapter 411

The dress hung loosely on Evelyn's petite frame. Designed to accentuate curves, the plunging neckline now gaped dangerously as one strap slid down her shoulder, revealing porcelain skin that glowed under the dim lighting.

Her citrusy shampoo mingled with the subtle vanilla of her perfume, creating an intoxicating aroma that made Nathaniel's grip tighten on the armrest. His gaze darkened as it traced the exposed collarbone, throat working visibly.

Evelyn followed his line of sight and gasped. The fallen strap had dragged the neckline lower, exposing more than intended. Heat flooded her cheeks as she slapped a hand over her chest.

"Eyes up here, Mr. Grayson!"

She yanked the strap back into place, but the oversized dress betrayed her again. Both straps slipped this time, the fabric pooling at her elbows. Mortification burned through her as she struggled with the rebellious garment.

Nathaniel's chuckle rumbled through the room. With deliberate slowness, he hooked the straps over his fingers and repositioned them. His touch lingered, tracing the curve of her shoulder.

"Like moonlight on silk," he murmured, thumb brushing the sensitive skin beneath her ear.

Evelyn caught the predatory glint in his eyes and leapt backward. "I should go. The others are waiting."

Nathaniel blocked her path effortlessly. "Not dressed like that."

"But I'm starving! The barbecue—" She shook her head, frowning. "What's wrong with this dress?"

His jaw tightened. "It's practically transparent. Might as well parade around in your underwear."

Evelyn scoffed. "Please. I've seen you at galas where women wore less fabric than my napkin. Spare me the prudish act."

Nathaniel's expression turned dangerous. "Those women aren't you. No one sees what's mine." He reached for his phone. "I'll have dinner brought up."

"No deal." Evelyn edged toward the door. Every instinct screamed that staying meant surrendering to the hunger in his gaze.

"Evelyn." His warning tone sent shivers down her spine.

She bolted.

Nathaniel moved like lightning. His hand closed around her wrist, spinning her into his chest. Before she could protest, his mouth crashed down on hers. The kiss burned through her defenses, his teeth scraping her lower lip before trailing down her throat.

"Stop!" Evelyn shoved against his shoulders. "Nathaniel, don't—"
###Chapter 412

Benjamin had just finished grilling a batch of his famous honey-glazed chicken wings. He sprinkled his secret spice blend with a flourish, certain Evelyn would be impressed by his culinary skills.

But when he turned toward the gazebo, it stood empty.

"Where did everyone go?"

He distinctly remembered Amelia pulling Evelyn aside for a private conversation earlier. Now both women had vanished.

Frowning, Benjamin balanced the tray of wings carefully as he headed indoors to search for them.

After combing through the mansion without success, he spotted Samuel and Amelia sitting together in the lounge. Amelia looked unusually pale, leaning heavily against her brother.

"Amelia, have you seen Evelyn?" Benjamin asked, approaching with his prized chicken wings.

Amelia opened her mouth to respond but broke into a coughing fit instead. Samuel's protective arm tightened around her shoulders.

"Why are you looking for her?" Samuel snapped, his voice sharp with accusation.

Benjamin froze under his brother's glare. "I just... made these wings for Evelyn to try..."

Samuel's expression darkened. "Your sister is clearly unwell, and all you care about is feeding that woman?"

The words struck Benjamin like a physical blow. He finally noticed Amelia's ashen complexion. "Amelia! Are you sick? Did you catch a chill outside?"

Amelia waved weakly. "It's... nothing..."

Samuel's grip on her tightened. "Didn't you see how Evelyn was tormenting Amelia outside? How can you think about feeding her when your own sister needs you?"

Benjamin's eyes widened. "Evelyn was harassing Amelia?"

Samuel's jaw clenched. "She forced Amelia to kneel, then kicked her to the ground. That's why she's like this now!"

"That can't be true," Benjamin protested. "Amelia, what really happened? I saw you two talking peacefully."

Amelia lowered her gaze, silent tears tracking down her cheeks. She shook her head slightly, as if unwilling to cause trouble.

But Samuel had no such reservations. "Evelyn assaulted her. Right in our own garden."

Benjamin's hands tightened around the tray. "Evelyn would never do that. There must be some mistake!"

Amelia's head jerked up in shock. Her little brother - always her staunchest defender - was taking Evelyn's side?
###Chapter 413

Amelia's smile didn't reach her eyes. She forced a gentle expression, masking her irritation beneath a veneer of understanding.

"Don't trouble yourself, Benjamin. I'm perfectly fine. I'm certain Evelyn didn't intend any harm. Let's just... move past this."

Benjamin nodded enthusiastically. "Exactly! She wouldn't do something like that. There must be some mistake. I'll go clarify things with her later."

Amelia clenched her jaw.

'Unbelievable! My own brother takes that woman's side over mine! What spell has she cast on him?' she fumed silently.

Samuel observed their exchange with growing displeasure. His voice cut through the tension like ice. "You seem remarkably certain of Evelyn's character. Tell me, what has she promised you in return for your loyalty?"

Benjamin swallowed hard under Samuel's piercing gaze. "Nothing! She's just... helped me before. Never asked for anything in return. Someone like that couldn't possibly be malicious!"

"Is that so?" Samuel's eyes darkened. "Then you're implying Amelia is lying about the incident?"

"That's not what I said!" Benjamin protested. "I just think there's been a misunderstanding. Evelyn would never hurt Amelia. Absolutely not!"

His emphatic use of "absolutely" made both siblings pause. Neither had seen Benjamin defend anyone with such conviction before.

The usually timid younger brother never challenged Samuel, who ruled the family with an iron fist. Yet here he stood, shoulders squared, ready to battle his intimidating elder brother over Evelyn's reputation.

Their heated exchange drew curious glances from nearby guests.

"Is that the Sinclair brothers arguing? What could possibly cause such a scene?"

"Look at Miss Rivers - she's practically in tears!"

"I've never seen Mister Benjamin stand up to Mister Samuel before. This must be serious."

Samuel studied his brother's uncharacteristic defiance, conflicting emotions flashing across his stern features.

'This timid boy who used to tremble at my shadow now dares oppose me? All for that woman?' The realization burned.

Not wishing to publicly humiliate his brother, Samuel offered an olive branch. "Regardless of today's events, you will stay away from Evelyn Whitmore. No unnecessary contact."

Benjamin's jaw set stubbornly. "She's my friend. I won't abandon her. Forgive me, Samuel, but I can't obey you this time."

"You insolent—!" Samuel barely restrained his temper.

'I gave him an out, yet he still defies me! All for that woman's sake?'

Drawing a steadying breath, Benjamin stood his ground. "Samuel, remember - Evelyn saved Grandfather. Are we really going to repay her kindness with this... this ingratitude?"

"How dare you!" Samuel's voice dropped dangerously low.
###Chapter 414

Amelia had never witnessed Samuel and Benjamin clash like this before, leaving her utterly bewildered.

Everyone knew Benjamin lived in constant fear of Samuel. Even if Samuel declared the sky was purple, Benjamin wouldn't dare contradict him. This unprecedented defiance was entirely Evelyn's doing.

The spectators watched the heated exchange with barely concealed excitement. Amelia couldn't bear the thought of her family becoming gossip fodder, so she tugged at Samuel's sleeve.

"Nathaniel, let it go. Benjamin's right. I must have misread Evelyn's intentions. She wouldn't deliberately kick me. Please don't fight with Benjamin anymore - he's still in that foolish teenage phase."

Amelia rose slowly, exhaling in resignation.

"I'll go upstairs to speak with Evelyn and Nathaniel. We should clear this misunderstanding immediately."

Truthfully, she'd been itching for an excuse to interrupt them. Earlier, she'd feigned illness to keep Nathaniel by her side, only for him to bolt upstairs the moment she "recovered."

The image of Evelyn and Nathaniel alone together pressed on her chest like an immovable boulder.

'Evelyn might be changing out of those wet clothes... Then sparks could fly... No! Nathaniel belongs to me! I won't allow it!'

At least now she had legitimate reason to check on them.

Samuel frowned as his fragile sister ascended the stairs alone, then turned his glare toward his idiot brother.

"Benjamin, what's gotten into you? First you fail at academics, now you're siding with outsiders against your own sister?"

Benjamin found the accusation unfair.

"Samuel, you know I'd die for Amelia! But Evelyn isn't who you think she is. Despite how often I've harassed her on Amelia's behalf, she still helped me when I needed it most!"

"I swear on my life - she's one of the good ones. I'm going up too to hear Evelyn's side. This is clearly just a misunderstanding!"

His motives were twofold: escape Samuel's wrath, and force Evelyn to taste his legendary grilled chicken wings.

Samuel remained seated in the armchair, his aristocratic features clouded with displeasure. He massaged his temples wearily.

"What am I to do with them? My sister pines for a man who'll never love her back, and my brother's a thoughtless fool. Will they ever stop being such burdens?"

The thought made him ache for Celeste. 'If only she were here. My brilliant little sister never caused me such worries. That child was always extraordinary - speaking in full sentences before she could walk, reading novels in kindergarten. The IQ tests placed her in the 99th percentile.'

He remembered coming home from elementary school to find his mother waiting at the intersection with Celeste in her arms. How his baby sister would wiggle free and toddle toward him on unsteady legs, giggling when she fell, dusting herself off before throwing herself into his arms.

Those simple, golden days didn't last, but their memory still warmed him.

'I wonder where Celeste is now... I hope she and Mother are safe.'

Losing them remained Samuel's greatest torment. He despised his childhood helplessness - if he'd been stronger, his mother wouldn't have left in despair. Wouldn't have vanished with Celeste. Wouldn't have...

As Samuel drowned in memories, the party guests clustered in whispering groups, dissecting the drama.
###Chapter 415

"Who's this Evelyn they're talking about?"

"Is she from some influential family?"

"No idea. Never heard of her before."

"Whoever she is, she must be something special to have both Mister Samuel and Mister Benjamin fighting over her!"

The murmurs stopped abruptly when Samuel Rivers shot the crowd a warning glare. His intense gaze carried enough authority to silence everyone instantly.

They weren't entirely wrong though. Evelyn Whitmore was indeed someone extraordinary. The fact that Benjamin Rivers—who'd never shown interest in any woman before—would publicly defend her spoke volumes.

Samuel's eyes narrowed dangerously. 'What game is Evelyn playing? She already has Nathaniel. Why is she stringing Benjamin along? I'm beginning to think her "accidental" meeting with grandfather at the embankment was all part of some calculated scheme.'

Upstairs in the guest room, Evelyn's cheeks burned with embarrassment.

"Mister, I swear I'll lose my temper if you don't stop—" she hissed through clenched teeth.

Nathaniel Grayson had her pinned against the wall for nearly ten minutes now, alternating between feather-light kisses and aggressive nips along her neck. She could already feel the telltale marks forming on her skin.

Hearing the warning in her voice, Nathaniel placed one final possessive kiss before pulling back to admire his handiwork.

His fingers traced the constellation of love bites with satisfaction. "I doubt you'd want anyone seeing these marks. Stay put—I'll bring you some food from the barbecue."

Evelyn was fuming. 'That manipulative bastard! He did this on purpose just to keep me from going downstairs. What's wrong with this dress anyway? Sure, it's a bit daring but it's not like I'm walking around naked! The man's insufferably possessive. Does he think every man is as perverted as him?'

Her anger made her cheeks puff up like an irritated chipmunk.

Nathaniel couldn't help but smile at the adorable sight. 'Even her anger is endearing.'

He gently tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear. "Be good and wait here, darling."

The moment the door clicked shut, Evelyn stormed into the bathroom. Her reflection showed the full extent of Nathaniel's claim—her neck looked like a vampire's favorite snack. Remembering how he'd devoured her skin made fresh heat rush to her face.

A sudden knock at the door startled her.

'That was fast... Wait, Nathaniel never knocks.'

Wrapping a towel securely around her neck to conceal the evidence, Evelyn went to answer the door.
###Chapter 416

Evelyn swung the door open to find Benjamin and Amelia hovering outside her threshold.

'God, these two are exhausting,' she thought, irritation flaring. Not in the mood for their drama, she arched one perfectly shaped brow. "What?"

Amelia's gaze darted past Evelyn first, scanning the room before adopting a contrite expression. "Evelyn... I've come to apologize. After careful consideration, I realize I misjudged you earlier. When I knelt in the gazebo, I thought that's what you wanted. And I know you didn't actually kick me."

Her voice dropped to a whisper. "It must have been an accidental brush when you walked by. I'm truly sorry for making Nathaniel think you were bullying me, which led to... your unfortunate swim. Please, can you find it in your heart to forgive me?"

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. 'Here we go again with the victim act.'

A sardonic smile played on her lips. "Save the performance, Amelia. Nathaniel isn't here to witness your little show."

Amelia stiffened, her eyes flickering with disbelief as she surreptitiously checked the room again. 'He's really not here?'

Evelyn had nailed it - this entire apology was staged for Nathaniel's benefit. Without his presence, Amelia wouldn't have bothered. Their relationship was beyond repair anyway.

But with Benjamin present, Amelia had to maintain the charade. "Evelyn, I'm not being fake. This apology comes from the heart. Please believe me."

Evelyn remained unmoved, her expression glacial. She recognized Amelia's tactic - emotional blackmail disguised as sincerity. Refusing forgiveness would paint Evelyn as the heartless villain preying on the "repentant" Amelia.

Most would cave to social pressure and accept the apology. But Amelia had picked the wrong target. Evelyn couldn't care less about others' opinions.

"Spare me the theatrics," Evelyn scoffed. "Save your Oscar-worthy performance for someone who actually cares."

Amelia's face crumpled with manufactured hurt. "Why do you insist I'm acting? Do you despise me that much?"

'Despise? Try utterly repulsed,' Evelyn thought.

She stifled a yawn, done with this farce. 'Anything I say will just fuel her victim narrative. Best to say nothing.'

As Evelyn moved to shut the door, Benjamin stepped forward, holding a plate of chicken wings. His boyish grin seemed out of place given the tension. "Evelyn, what really happened at the gazebo? Samuel claims you forced Amelia to kneel and kicked her. True story?"

Evelyn's frown deepened. 'Why won't these Rivers siblings leave me alone?'

Another yawn escaped as she waved a dismissive hand. "Your sister dropped to her knees unprovoked and took a tumble. End of story."

She saw no point in lengthy explanations. Those who believed her would regardless; the doubters would remain unconvinced no matter what she said.

"Oh, got it!" Benjamin nodded instantly, accepting her version without question. He turned to Amelia, his expression shifting.
###Chapter 417

"I get it now, Amelia! You must've misheard Evelyn asking you to kneel, lost your balance, and fell. Then Samuel just happened to see that part and assumed Evelyn kicked you."

Amelia's jaw tightened. Is this fool really related to me? How can he side with her instead of me?

Evelyn arched a brow, surprised by Benjamin's sudden clarity. Well, looks like he finally grew a brain. After all these years of blindly defending Amelia, he's finally seeing the truth.

Amelia forced a dry laugh. "Yes, that must be it. I was feeling lightheaded from the cold... must've misheard."

She had always maintained her sweet, gentle facade. Even though she disagreed, she wouldn't dare argue openly.

With the misunderstanding cleared, Benjamin eagerly shoved the plate of chicken wings toward Evelyn.

"Here! Try my special sauce wings. They're a bit cold now, but trust me—you've never tasted anything like this."

Hungry, Evelyn didn’t hesitate. She grabbed one and took a bite.

"Wow. These are actually amazing."

Benjamin puffed up with pride. "Told you. No lies here."

Evelyn gave him an approving nod. "You weren’t exaggerating. Best barbecue in the city, hands down."

The praise made him flush, so he deflected by bragging more. "Obviously. My skills are legendary."

Amelia watched them, her smile brittle. The cozy scene made her blood boil. Why does it feel like I’m the intruder? He’s MY brother, not hers!

She stepped forward, sweetly asking, "Benjamin, can I have one too?"

Her hand reached out, a silent challenge to Evelyn—See? He’ll always choose me.

But Benjamin pulled the plate away.

Amelia’s face darkened instantly.

"You shouldn’t eat cold food, Amelia. You know it upsets your stomach."

For a second, she froze—then beamed. "You’re so thoughtful. But you should extend that care to Evelyn too. Cold food isn’t good for anyone."

Ha! See that, Evelyn? He doesn’t care about your stomach at all!

Benjamin coughed awkwardly. "Uh, don’t take it wrong, Evelyn. Amelia’s always had a weak stomach. For normal people, it’s fine."

To prove his point, he grabbed a wing and ate it.

Evelyn couldn’t care less. If he favored his sister, so what? That was natural.

"Then can I have the rest?" she asked.

Thrilled she liked them, Benjamin grinned. "Of course! Take them all."

Evelyn pulled the plate closer. "Great. You two can leave now."

Benjamin blinked. He didn’t want to go. Something about Evelyn felt... familiar. Like family.

He scrambled for an excuse to stay when he noticed something odd.

"Evelyn... why is there a towel around your neck?"
###Chapter 418

A strange look flickered across Evelyn's face. Her fingers instinctively brushed against the towel draped around her neck.

"It's chilly," she said quickly.

Benjamin frowned, unconvinced. "A towel won't do anything. Take my jacket instead."

He turned to Amelia. "You're warm now, right?"

Amelia blinked. "Yes... I'm fine."

His tone turned serious. "Then give it to Evelyn. She fell into the pond earlier—we can't risk her getting sick."

Only then did Amelia realize she was still wearing Benjamin's jacket. Her smile stiffened as she slowly shrugged it off.

"Of course," she murmured, handing it back.

Benjamin didn't hesitate. He thrust the jacket toward Evelyn. "Put it on."

Evelyn eyed the offered jacket, then arched a brow at his earnest expression. She waved a dismissive hand.

"No need."

He shoved it into her arms. "Stop being stubborn."

"I'm not—"

Before she could finish, Benjamin yanked the towel from her neck and draped the jacket over her shoulders.

The marks on her skin were suddenly exposed.

Amelia's eyes darkened. Hickies? Nathaniel must've gone wild with her.

Benjamin stared, his mind racing.

Evelyn's face burned. She pressed a hand to her forehead, scrambling for an excuse. "Uh—"

"Your allergies flared up again?" Benjamin cut in, deadly serious. "Why didn't you say anything? I'm calling an ambulance."

Evelyn nearly choked. "No! It's not that bad."

"You're being reckless."

"I'm fine," she hissed.

Internally, she groaned. This idiot is worse when he's being nice.

Amelia's sweet facade cracked as she watched Benjamin fuss over Evelyn. Her fingers curled into fists.
###Chapter 419

"What's going on here?" Nathaniel's voice cut through the tension like a blade.

Evelyn and Benjamin—still arguing about whether to call emergency services—snapped their heads toward him.

Nathaniel stood motionless, his icy gaze sweeping over them from across the hallway.

"Nathaniel!"

The darkness in Amelia's eyes vanished instantly. She blinked up at him with practiced innocence and rushed forward.

"Nathaniel, I came to apologize to Evelyn for our misunderstanding, but she won't forgive me," she said, sighing dramatically.

Nathaniel barely glanced at Amelia before his attention shifted to Benjamin, then finally settled on the jacket draped over Evelyn's shoulders. His expression darkened. "Whose jacket is that?"

Evelyn hesitated.

Benjamin stiffened. "Evelyn said she was cold, so I gave her mine. She's having an allergic reaction—I wanted to call an ambulance, but she refused. Nathaniel, talk some sense into her."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. The sight of Evelyn in another man's jacket already irritated him, but Benjamin's lingering concern—his eyes drifting too close to the plunging neckline of her dress—ignited something far more dangerous.

He strode forward, ignoring Amelia completely. With a sharp tilt of his chin, he commanded, "Take it off. Now."

"Fine."

She hadn't wanted to wear it anyway. Benjamin had practically wrestled it onto her after yanking the towel from her neck. Honestly, she'd been too focused on stopping him from dialing 911 to even notice.

Evelyn shrugged off the jacket and handed it back. Immediately, Nathaniel stripped off his own and wrapped it around her, cocooning her so tightly only her face remained visible. No one else would get another glimpse of that dress.

Benjamin accepted his jacket without protest but couldn't let it go. "Nathaniel, about the rash on her neck—"

Why is this brat still staring at her neck? Nathaniel's patience snapped.

"Not your concern," he bit out. "Adults handle their own problems. Take your sister to Samuel. I won't have him blaming me if either of you gets hurt."

He curled an arm around Evelyn's waist and steered her toward the door.

Amelia stood frozen, watching them retreat. Then, without thinking, she lunged forward. "Nathaniel, wait!"

He paused. "What?"

Her eyes shimmered with unshed tears. "Do you remember your promise?"

Nathaniel turned, his expression unreadable. After a long silence, he answered softly, "Yes. I haven't forgotten."

Amelia nodded like a child reassured. "Good. I'll be waiting."

Evelyn had no clue what they were discussing, but when she glanced back, Amelia's smile sent chills down her spine. Deliberately, Amelia placed a hand on her stomach and smirked—a silent, taunting reminder.

Then it hit her.

The scar.

Amelia had once claimed it was from a C-section. That she'd borne Nathaniel's child.
###Chapter 420

"What's on your mind?"

Evelyn snapped out of her thoughts when Nathaniel lightly tapped her nose.

He crouched down, bringing himself to eye level with her as she sat on the edge of the bed.

"The grill was left alone too long, so everything burned. I already asked someone to make fresh food for you—it'll be here soon," Nathaniel said softly.

Evelyn wasn't hungry anymore after the chicken wings Benjamin had given her. She smirked, tilting her head.

"Tell me, Nathaniel... you don’t have any big, dark secrets you’re hiding from me, do you?"

A flicker of hesitation crossed his face before he knelt in front of her, his gaze unwavering. "No. I don’t."

"Good."

She believed him without question. Amelia’s nonsense hadn’t shaken her. In fact, she would’ve forgotten the whole thing if Amelia hadn’t given her that unsettling smile earlier.

After two months with Nathaniel, Evelyn knew one thing for certain—his integrity was unshakable. He wasn’t the kind of man who would abandon his own child.

And Amelia? She loved playing games. If she really had a child with Nathaniel, she would’ve used it to force him into marriage long ago. Keeping it a secret? Not her style.

Nathaniel studied her. "Why ask me that?"

Evelyn shrugged. "Just curious. Anyway, want to try one of Benjamin’s chicken wings? They’re amazing."

She grabbed one from the bedside table and held it out to him.

Nathaniel took a bite, smiling. "You’re right. Delicious. Have more if you like them. Then we’ll head home."

Evelyn nodded. "Sure."

He ruffled her hair, his eyes warm. "Eat up, trouble."

Internally, he berated himself. Today was supposed to be fun, but instead, she’d ended up in the pond. He swore it wouldn’t happen again.

By the time they got back to the estate, it was late.

Nathaniel walked her to her door. "I’m leaving for a business trip tomorrow. Take care of yourself while I’m gone, okay? Don’t wander off too much. Don’t make me worry."

"How long?"

"About two weeks."

Evelyn frowned. "Why so long?"

Nathaniel smirked, leaning in. "Sounds like someone’s going to miss me. How about a goodbye kiss?"

He tilted his head, waiting.

Evelyn grinned but didn’t indulge him. Instead, she patted his cheek. "Nice try. Safe travels. Goodnight."

With that, she slipped into her room and locked the door.

Nathaniel exhaled, torn between amusement and frustration.

That little minx. One kiss. Is that too much to ask?

Over the next two weeks, Evelyn threw herself into designing the new Grayson Group headquarters while Nathaniel was away.
###Chapter 421

Nathaniel claimed she hadn't given her full effort in the initial draft she'd sent him. Determined to prove him wrong, Evelyn poured every last drop of creativity into this new design, completing it just before his scheduled return. With the final drawing emailed, she leaned back, awaiting his response.

"This has to be perfect," she reassured herself. The weight of the project lifted from her shoulders, leaving room for much-needed relaxation.

She reached for her phone, intending to lose herself in a mobile game. But the date on the screen caught her eye - today marked the final day of her three-month arrangement with Nathaniel.

"Three months already?" The realization startled her. Their relationship had evolved so much since that first contractual meeting.

Strangely, what she'd once counted down to now filled her with reluctance. During Nathaniel's two-week business trip, their nightly video calls had become something she secretly anticipated. Hearing his voice, seeing his face before bed - these small moments had carved a space in her routine she didn't want to lose.

"Maybe... just maybe we could make this real when he returns," she mused, cheeks warming at the thought. The unfamiliar flutter in her chest confirmed it - she missed him.

Her fingers hovered over the messaging app, tempted to check in. But a notification badge demanding attention derailed her plan. The profile picture - an overly posed selfie of Cassandra - made her sigh.

Evelyn tapped the thread with mild curiosity. The messages, each more venomous than the last, spanned weeks. Cassandra's digital tantrum began the day her family was evicted from the Whitmore estate, escalating with time.

Normally, Evelyn dismissed these rants as background noise. Today, with time to spare and closure needed, she decided to face the storm head-on.

The Whitmore mansion loomed before her, its familiarity now foreign after months away. The door swung open to reveal Cassandra, face obscured by a skincare mask that did little to soften her expression.

"Well, if it isn't the prodigal daughter," Cassandra sneered, peeling off the mask. "Did the Graysons finally see through you? Or are you here to gloat about stealing my life?"

Evelyn remained unshaken. "I'm only here to reclaim what's mine."

Cassandra's face twisted. "Yours? Don't make me laugh. Everything in this house belongs to me now. Those pathetic keepsakes in the attic? Gone. Thrown out like the trash they were."

She stepped closer, venom dripping from every word. "Father raised you, fed you, and how do you repay him? By abandoning us the second a richer family came along. Nathaniel should have been mine! You're nothing but a scheming, ungrateful-"

"Enough." Evelyn's voice cut through the tirade. "I didn't come for a lecture. Just the truth." Her gaze never wavered as she delivered her final blow. "Starting with who really belongs here."
###Chapter 422

Evelyn wasn't the least bit intimidated by Cassandra's outburst. She stifled another yawn, clearly finding the entire situation tedious. With a cool smile, she stated, "Frankly, I couldn't care less about being welcome here. I'm only here to reclaim my engagement gifts."

The mention of gifts made Cassandra stiffen. Her face twisted in outrage. "How dare you claim those gifts? They don't belong to you!"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Don't belong to me? Correct me if I'm wrong, but those gifts came from my husband, Nathaniel. That makes them mine by right."

The words 'my husband' sent Cassandra into fresh rage. 'How dare she call Nathaniel her husband? He was meant to be mine! If only this scheming witch hadn't stolen him away!'

Her fury mounting, Cassandra jabbed a finger at Evelyn. "Evelyn Whitmore, I've had enough of your nonsense! Nathaniel gave those gifts to me, not you! Everyone knows they're rightfully mine! You stole my fiancé, you shameless gold-digger, and now you have the audacity to demand the gifts too? I swear, if you push me—"

Cassandra would rather die than surrender those gifts. After losing Nathaniel, they were her last lifeline. Each piece was worth a fortune—enough to sustain her now that her acting career was ruined after offending director Vincent Blackwood.

'Over my dead body will she take them,' Cassandra seethed.

"Cassandra, what's all this shouting about?" Victoria emerged, drawn by the commotion.

Cassandra jerked her chin toward Evelyn. "Look who's crawled back. She's here to steal my engagement gifts now."

Victoria's reaction mirrored her daughter's. Storming forward, she glared at Evelyn. "Have you no shame? First you steal Nathaniel, now you want the gifts too? Your father would never allow this!"

Evelyn remained unfazed. "I don't need permission to reclaim what's mine. The gifts belong to me as Nathaniel's wife."

Victoria scoffed. "Greedy little thing, aren't you? You've already won Nathaniel—must you take everything?"

'Greedy?' Evelyn nearly laughed. 'These two hypocrites would rob me blind given the chance.'

A knowing smile curved her lips. "Aunt Victoria, I've never taken what wasn't mine. But make no mistake—I will fight for what rightfully belongs to me. Those gifts came from my husband, and as his wife, I'm taking them back."
###Chapter 423

Victoria Blackwood let out a derisive laugh. "Oh spare me the theatrics! Stop using Nathaniel to intimidate us. He would've married Cassandra if you hadn't interfered! My daughter would be Mrs. Grayson by now!"

Her face flushed with anger whenever she dwelled on what could have been.

Evelyn Whitmore was stunned by their unwavering confidence. Even now, they clung to the delusion that Cassandra was Nathaniel's first choice.

'As if a man like Nathaniel would ever fall for someone as artificial as Cassandra,' Evelyn thought wryly.

The commotion at the entrance roused Gregory from his nap. Rubbing sleep from his eyes, he descended the stairs to investigate.

His expression darkened when he spotted Evelyn. "You! How dare you show your face here again?"

Evelyn noted his injuries hadn't fully healed - swollen eyes and bruised nose giving him the appearance of a battered prizefighter.

'The servants must have given him quite the beating when he stormed in with Cassandra and Victoria that day,' she realized.

She met his glare evenly. "Yes, I'm back. And why shouldn't I be? I've done nothing wrong."

Gregory's face twisted with rage. Shoving Victoria and Cassandra aside, he jabbed a finger at Evelyn. "You ungrateful wretch! After ordering the servants to attack me? Today you'll learn what happens to disrespectful daughters!"

His hand swung toward her face with surprising speed.

But Evelyn caught his wrist effortlessly, her grip like steel. "Mr. Whitmore, I'd advise against violence. Let's have a civilized conversation instead."

This wasn't Gregory's first attempt to strike her.

Previously, believing him her biological father, she'd shown restraint - dodging rather than blocking his blows to spare his dignity.

No longer.

Her fingers tightened around his wrist. The coldness in her eyes held neither respect nor mercy.

Gregory strained against her hold, shocked when his greater size and weight proved useless against her slender frame.

'Since when did she become so strong? This isn't the weak girl I remember,' he thought, panic rising.

Humiliation burned through him. "Have you lost your mind? Striking your own father? You'll burn for this!"

Evelyn's voice remained calm. "I simply want answers. Tell me the truth, and I might let you keep the engagement gifts."

Gregory's eyes widened. 'She came for the gifts? Over my dead body! Those are the most valuable things I've ever owned!'
###Chapter 424

The Whitmores lived in an upscale neighborhood, surrounded by luxury brands that painted the illusion of wealth. But it was all a facade. Their reality was far from the extravagant lifestyle they pretended to have.

Gregory had inherited a few properties from his ancestors, but none were in desirable locations. Selling them for quick cash wasn’t an option.

For years, he rented them out, but the income barely covered their basic expenses—certainly not enough to sustain their lavish habits and relentless need to impress others.

Before, they had relied on Cassandra’s acting career to fund their excesses. But now that she was blacklisted, their financial lifeline had been cut. They were burning through what little they had left.

Nathaniel’s engagement gifts were their last hope to maintain their façade. Naturally, they weren’t about to let Evelyn take them back.

Gregory struggled against his youngest daughter’s grip, but no matter how hard he pulled, he couldn’t break free. A man who saw women as beneath him would never tolerate such humiliation.

"You ungrateful brat!" he snarled. "First, you forget about me after marrying into money, and now you dare demand the gifts back? Let me make this clear—they belong to me! Since the dawn of time, engagement gifts go to the bride’s parents, and I decide what happens to them. Now let go!"

Evelyn didn’t release him. Instead, her fingers tightened around his wrist. "Mr. Whitmore, I’ll ask one last time. Are we going to talk privately, or not?"

Gregory gritted his teeth, pain shooting through his arm. He had never imagined Evelyn—whom he’d always dismissed as weak—could be this strong.

"Fine!" he spat. "Let go, and we’ll talk in my study!"

Only then did she release him. A cold smile curved her lips. "Good. Lead the way."

He rubbed his wrist, glaring at her before storming upstairs.

Cassandra panicked. "Dad, don’t listen to her! She’s just trying to manipulate you. The only way to deal with a traitor like her is to throw her out!"

Gregory scowled. He disagreed. No matter how insolent Evelyn was, she was still Nathaniel’s wife. Kicking her out wasn’t the issue—he feared what would happen if she ran back to Nathaniel in tears. He couldn’t afford another beating from Nathaniel’s men.

Victoria, too, was uneasy. What is that girl planning now?

"Gregory—" she began, but he cut her off with a dismissive wave. "Enough! This doesn’t concern either of you. If she wants to talk, let her talk. I want to hear what she has to say."

Neither Cassandra nor Victoria could stop them. They could only watch as Evelyn followed Gregory into the study.

Inside, Gregory sat behind his desk, his expression stern. "Well? Spit it out. What do you want?"

Without waiting for an invitation, Evelyn took a seat. "Mr. Whitmore, let’s be honest with each other."
###Chapter 425

"Tell me about your relationship with my birth mother. Why did you go to the hospital to pick me up instead of her?"

Gregory's expression froze, his eyes widening in shock. "You know about that?"

"Yes. And I also know you're not my real father."

So that's why she's been calling me 'Mister Whitmore' all this time. His face darkened as he snapped, "How dare you! When will you stop with this nonsense? Evelyn Whitmore, you are my daughter! Are you seriously trying to abandon your own family just because you married into wealth?"

Evelyn remained unfazed. "I'm sorry, Mister Whitmore, but I've already taken a paternity test. There's no biological connection between us, so you can't fool me."

Gregory stiffened. He hadn't expected her to go that far. "You did what behind my back?"

Evelyn crossed her arms lazily. "Oh, I didn't plan it. I just figured I might as well get tested while you and Cassandra were doing yours."

Realizing the truth was out, Gregory clenched his jaw and scoffed. "So what if we're not blood-related? I raised you—that makes me your father!"

A cold smile touched Evelyn's lips. "Did you? I don't recall you ever raising me."

Gregory had no retort. It was true—he'd never raised this adopted daughter. Instead, she'd been dumped in the countryside and only allowed back after getting into university on a full scholarship. She hadn't cost him a single penny.

But Evelyn wasn't here to argue about his failures as a parent. "Whether you're my real father or not doesn't matter. I came here to talk about my mother. Tell me everything you know about her, Mister Whitmore."

Gregory's face twisted with discomfort. "There's nothing to say! Whatever happened between us is none of your business!"

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. "She's my mother. That gives me every right to know the truth."

Gregory stubbornly shook his head. "Even so, I don't remember anything from back then."

"You don't remember?" Evelyn didn't flinch. She stood slowly, smoothing her dress. "Fine. If you won't talk, I'll be taking the engagement gifts with me."

The mention of losing those gifts made Gregory panic. "Wait!"

Evelyn paused, glancing back. "Yes? Has your memory returned, Mister Whitmore?"

He glared at her, frustration simmering. "I'll tell you what I know—but that's it."

Satisfied, Evelyn sat back down. "Go on."

Gregory exhaled sharply, irritation flashing across his face. "Your mother and I attended the same university. I confessed my feelings, but she rejected me. Then, fifteen years ago, I ran into her by chance. She begged me to go to the Children's Hospital to pick you up. After that, we never spoke again."

Evelyn's fingers tightened slightly. "What was her name?"

"Vivian. Vivian Sterling."

Vivian Sterling. Evelyn repeated the name silently, committing it to memory. Then she fixed Gregory with a piercing stare. "What else do you know?"
###Chapter 426

"I don't know much else. Only that she came from money because once..."

He cleared his throat awkwardly. "I happened to see her entering this massive estate and calling the elderly couple inside Mom and Dad."

Evelyn could tell from Gregory's guilty expression that he'd likely stalked Vivian home to learn more about her.

His eyes grew distant with memory. "Your mother was always the quiet type. Top of her class, kindhearted, never acted superior despite her background. Everyone at school adored her - boys and girls alike."

'So mom was gentle and kind.' Though Evelyn had no clear memories of her mother, she could almost feel Vivian's warm smile watching over her. She'd been five when Gregory adopted her. Old enough to remember something, yet her mind remained blank before that age - a mystery that troubled her.

"Mr. Whitmore," Evelyn asked carefully, "do you recall where that mansion was located?"

"Thssa City. Same name as our university. But the place has changed beyond recognition since then. I'd get lost there now. That estate? Probably demolished for some urban development by now."

Evelyn considered this. "Did she ever explain why she couldn't come get me from the hospital herself?"

Gregory hesitated. "We knew each other from the university art club. Years later at an alumni dinner, we exchanged numbers. Then out of nowhere, she called saying someone wanted her dead. Begged me to protect you. I agreed without thinking." His voice dropped. "After that... I could never reach her again. I assumed her pursuers found her."

His regret was palpable. Evelyn didn't blame him. She wasn't his blood - his reluctance to love her made sense. And she owed him her life.

"Anything else about my mother?" she pressed.

"Just one thing." He met her gaze. "Your mother painted under the name Vivian Sterling. But you knew that already."

Evelyn nodded.

"The artist who taught her? Raphael Devereaux. Find him, and you might learn more."

"Thank you, Mr. Whitmore." Evelyn stood to leave when Gregory called after her.

"Evelyn."

She turned. "Yes?"

He studied her - this living image of his first love. The child he both wanted to cherish and resented for existing. The reason he'd sent her away all those years.

His frown deepened. "Don't say I didn't warn you, but... you shouldn't look for your mother."

"Why not?"

"I don't know what happened to her, but she was adamant - no one could ever know you're her daughter." His voice turned grave. "Because if they find out... they'll kill you."
###Chapter 427

"You should live comfortably as a wealthy man's wife and leave the past behind. I made a promise to your mother—that I wouldn't let her enemies find you. That way, her soul can rest in peace," Gregory said.

Evelyn froze.

Her father had never shown her affection before. Maybe he still cares for my mother, she thought.

A faint smile touched her lips. "Thank you for telling me. I'll live well and protect myself. Goodbye, Mister Whitmore."

She turned and walked out, her steps unhurried.

Gregory frowned, exhaling heavily. Evelyn had survived to twenty—he'd kept his promise to Vivian. Whatever happened next wasn't his concern. She had chosen her own path.

Downstairs, burly men carried out engagement gifts from the Whitmore mansion.

"Stop! Who do you think you are? Those are mine! Put them down!" Cassandra shrieked.

"That's right! You can't take them! I'm calling the police!" Victoria threatened.

Evelyn descended the stairs, calm. "I told them to take the gifts."

Cassandra's eyes burned with fury. "You witch! What gives you the right?"

Evelyn tilted her head. "Every right. These were given to me by my husband. Isn't that reason enough?"

Cassandra's hands clenched. "First, you steal Nathaniel, now this? I swear, Evelyn, I'll end you!"

She lunged, but Victoria yanked her back. "Cassandra, think!"

Gregory stormed downstairs, irritation sharp in his voice. "What now? Can't I have a moment's peace?"

After a pause, he sighed. "One more thing."

Evelyn waited.

"Your mother loved art. She painted under the name Vivian Sterling."

"I know."

"Her teacher was Raphael Devereaux. If you find him, he might tell you more."

Evelyn nodded. "Understood. Thank you, Mister Whitmore."

She turned to leave.

"Evelyn."

She glanced back. "Yes?"

Gregory studied her—so much like Vivian. His first love's child. Part of him wanted to cherish her. The other part recoiled, remembering she wasn't his.

His voice hardened. "Don't say I didn't warn you. Stop searching for your mother."

"Why?"

"I don't know what happened, but she made me swear—if anyone discovers you're her daughter, they'll kill you."
###Chapter 428

Cassandra snapped out of her shock, her eyes burning with envy as she glared at Evelyn. "Hah! Where else would she get that kind of money if not by tricking Nathaniel into giving it to her?" she spat, her voice dripping with bitterness.

Victoria, predictably, shared the same thought. "Evelyn, you shouldn’t use someone else’s money to clean up your own mess. Aren’t you afraid the Graysons will investigate and punish you for spending their fortune without permission?"

Evelyn smiled, unfazed. "Aunt Victoria, you seem to have forgotten something crucial. Nathaniel is my husband. Legally, his money is mine. Take yourself, for example—has your husband ever demanded you return every penny you’ve spent of his?"

Victoria’s face paled, then darkened with fury. She was so enraged she couldn’t form a coherent response.

Cassandra looked even worse, her expression twisted with disbelief. She had assumed the Graysons would despise Evelyn for her rural upbringing and eventually cast her out. The idea that Evelyn had access to such vast wealth shattered her worldview.

Damn it! This wasn’t supposed to happen!

Evelyn checked her watch lazily, then stifled a yawn. "It’s getting late. I won’t stay for lunch. As for the check—does it matter where the money came from, as long as you have it? If you think it’s too little, then grow a spine and don’t spend a dime."

Neither Cassandra nor Victoria dared to argue. They didn’t want Evelyn thinking they’d refuse the money. Even if the Graysons questioned it later, all evidence would point to Evelyn acting alone. The Blackwoods would be in the clear.

Gregory stayed silent, tucking the check into his pocket as the hired men carried away the engagement gifts. With this much money, he couldn’t care less what Evelyn did next.

In the end, Evelyn’s men reclaimed every engagement gift—including the painting Starlight Over the Lake, a masterpiece by her late mother, Vivian Sterling, which Nathaniel had given her.

From this moment on, Evelyn and the Blackwoods were severed. Their paths would never cross again.

A sleek black minivan idled nearby. Evelyn slid open the door and climbed inside.

Seraphina sat in the driver’s seat, reapplying her lipstick in the rearview mirror. Sebastian lounged in the passenger seat, engrossed in a mobile game.

He exited the app the second Evelyn settled in. "Boss," he said, twisting around, "no offense, but why bother being nice to those people? They treated you like garbage. You could crush them now if you wanted."

Evelyn leaned back, massaging her temples. She exhaled slowly before answering. "My mother must have been desperate to reach out to an old classmate she hadn’t seen in years. Whatever Gregory’s reasons were for taking me in, he risked everything to help her when she had nothing. That’s worth something." She closed her eyes. "As long as they stay out of my life, I won’t seek revenge."
###Chapter 429

Sebastian and Seraphina exchanged glances. Their hearts ached for Evelyn.

Since childhood, she had never known the warmth of a family. Instead, she was exiled to the countryside, enduring hardships no child should face. They had witnessed firsthand the blood, sweat, and tears she shed to reach where she stood today.

Seeing Evelyn so subdued, Sebastian decided to lighten the mood. "Boss, let’s hit the bar to celebrate getting your engagement gifts back."

'Drinking in the middle of the day? Hard pass.' Evelyn wasn’t in the mood. She waved him off. "Sebastian, find out if any grand mansions were demolished in Thssa over the last twenty years. If so, track down the original owner. Also, dig up everything on a former Thssa University student named Vivian Sterling. Get me the details ASAP."

Sebastian sensed the urgency in her tone. "Vivian Sterling—that’s your mother’s name?"

Evelyn nodded. 'Mister Grayson might believe my mother was killed by an enemy, but my gut tells me she’s still alive.'

Seraphina adjusted her gold-rimmed glasses, frowning at Evelyn’s pallor. "We should eat first. Look at you—you’ve lost weight."

Sebastian studied Evelyn and nodded. With a teasing grin, he added, "Boss, don’t tell me you’ve lost your appetite pining over Mister Nathaniel. Food fixes everything. My treat—what do you want?"

Seraphina shot him a glare. "You’re buying her lunch? Remind me again who’s responsible for you not being broke right now? You’d be penniless without her!"

Sebastian scoffed. "Exactly why I’m treating her! What’s wrong with that?"

Seraphina rolled her eyes. "Fine. Let’s get grilled lamb chops. It’s getting cold, and lamb warms you up. The boss always craves the fat this time of year."

The mention of lamb chops usually made Evelyn’s mouth water. But this time, the thought of the rich, smoky flavor twisted her stomach.

Suddenly, she couldn’t hold it in. She yanked down the car window, leaned out, and retched violently. When she finally pulled back inside, gasping, she found Sebastian and Seraphina staring at her like she’d grown a second head.

She knew that look. They’d grown up together—she could read their minds.

Evelyn scowled. "Stop. It’s not what you’re thinking. Just a stomach bug."

Sebastian smirked. "Really? Then tell me, boss—have you and Mister Nathaniel been… careful?"

Evelyn yawned, unfazed. "No need. We sleep in separate rooms."

Sebastian’s jaw dropped. "What? You’re wasting that man’s perfection? How do you resist?"

Seraphina smacked his arm. "Whose side are you on? Our boss is the catch here! Mister Nathaniel should be grateful she even married him!"

"Ow!" Rubbing his arm, Sebastian chuckled. "Fair point."

Seraphina sighed. "Still, to be safe, grab a pregnancy test from the pharmacy."

Evelyn groaned. "Unbelievable."
###Chapter 430

Sebastian feigned embarrassment. "Why me? I'm still untouched. Buying that would be mortifying!"

Both Seraphina and Evelyn stared at him in dead silence.

His attempt at humor fell flat. The two women regarded him with identical expressions of disgust, lips pressed into thin lines.

He dropped the act with a dramatic sigh. "Fine, fine. I'll get the damn test. Can you believe this? Sebastian Monroe, CEO of Newmoon Group, reduced to running errands like some lowly intern. The indignity!"

Seraphina shot him a withering glance before turning the ignition. As she pulled into traffic, her eyes kept darting to the rearview mirror, watching Evelyn's pale reflection.

'She looks terrible after all that vomiting,' Seraphina thought, worry creasing her brow.

Evelyn did feel awful. Between burning the midnight oil on Nathaniel Grayson's architectural project and barely sleeping despite being homebound, exhaustion clung to her like a second skin. Lately, even simple tasks left her drained - she'd begun suspecting chronic fatigue.

"There's a pharmacy!" Sebastian pointed out the window. "Why aren't stopping?"

Seraphina's grip tightened on the wheel. "Forget the test. We're taking her to the hospital."

"Since when does our boss voluntarily enter hospitals?" Sebastian countered.

"It's just bloodwork," Seraphina insisted, meeting Evelyn's gaze in the mirror. "You need proper tests. What if it's ectopic? Early detection saves lives."

Evelyn's mouth twitched. 'Not pregnant, yet she's diagnosing complications?' Still, two missed periods gnawed at her. Stress or consequence of that reckless night with Nathaniel?

Under dual pressure, Evelyn relented.

OB-GYN Department, Mercy General Hospital.

The silver-haired specialist studied the results. "Congratulations. Seven weeks along with excellent fetal development."

Evelyn's hand flew to her abdomen. 'Seven weeks?' The timeline matched perfectly.

While Seraphina remained composed, Sebastian erupted. "Oh my God! I'm going to be—"

"Control yourself, father!" The doctor snapped. "This is a hospital!"

Sebastian sputtered. "I'm the uncle! The father's—"

"Then where is he?" The doctor demanded.

Evelyn's cheeks flushed. "Business trip overseas. He doesn't know yet."

The specialist sighed. "Unacceptable. No matter how busy, a man should accompany his pregnant partner. Mark my words - next appointment, he'd better be here."

Evelyn nodded meekly, already dreading Nathaniel's reaction to the news.
###Chapter 431

The doctor smiled warmly. "Your baby is perfectly healthy, but your own condition needs attention. More rest, nutritious meals, and no stress. Make sure your family takes good care of you."

Nathaniel grinned. "Don't worry, Doctor. She'll be pampered like royalty."

Evelyn stepped out of the clinic in a haze. The idea of a tiny life growing inside her was surreal.

One night. That was all it took.

Nathaniel had been drugged, his body burning with need. She had no choice but to give in—his health depended on it.

One time. And now this.

At twenty, marriage and motherhood had never crossed her mind. The news hit her like a tidal wave.

Kids? No. They were loud, messy, and would derail every plan she'd ever made.

Yet...

A strange warmth curled in her chest.

Her thoughts drifted back to that night—Nathaniel's rough hands, his desperate restraint. The way he'd held her afterward, his breath ragged against her skin.

Her cheeks flushed.

Would he be happy? Would that usually composed man turn into a grinning fool at the news?

She ached to see him.

"He's been gone two weeks," she murmured. "I'll tell him when he's back. No point disrupting his work now."

Sebastian nudged her shoulder. "So, Boss. How does it feel? Future mom jitters?"

Evelyn blinked, then yawned. "It's... something."

Sebastian immediately gripped her elbow. "Careful! The floor's wet. Wouldn't want you slipping."

She rolled her eyes. "I'm not made of glass. You're acting like I'm already waddling."

Seraphina flipped through the medical reports. "Listen to him. Doctor said you're fragile. From now on, healthy meals only."

Food. Right. Evelyn's stomach growled, but the thought of anything heavy made her queasy. Something light—

Sebastian suddenly perked up. "Boss. Look." He pointed. "Isn't that Nathaniel over there? By pediatrics?"

Evelyn froze.

Tall. Broad-shouldered. That unmistakable aura of quiet command.

Nathaniel.

Sebastian smirked. "He's back early. Think he already knows? Maybe he's researching diaper changes."
###Chapter 432

Evelyn's pulse quickened at the sight of Nathaniel's broad shoulders. 'He appeared right when I needed him most. This can't be coincidence.'

She moved toward him, rehearsing how to share her pregnancy news. Sebastian started after her, but Seraphina caught his arm.

"Don't interrupt," Seraphina murmured, adjusting her designer glasses.

Sebastian rolled his eyes. "Just making sure our boss doesn't trip over her own feet."

"She's more graceful than you give her credit for," Seraphina countered.

They watched with bated breath as Evelyn approached Nathaniel.

"Nathan—"

Before she could finish, a curly-haired toddler wobbled from the pediatric clinic and clung to Nathaniel's leg. "Dada!"

Evelyn froze mid-step.

Nathaniel scooped up the giggling child effortlessly. "Where's your mother?"

Evelyn recognized his voice instantly—that rich baritone couldn't belong to anyone else.

Amelia emerged moments later, smoothing her silk blouse. "The doctor says it's just a cold. I'll get his medicine." She handed Nathaniel a prescription slip before striding toward the pharmacy.

Evelyn observed how naturally Nathaniel cradled the child. Sebastian and Seraphina exchanged alarmed glances before rushing to her side.

Sebastian hissed, "I thought he was single before meeting you!"

"Single doesn't mean celibate," Seraphina snapped, eyeing Evelyn's pale face.

Evelyn remained statue-still, then dialed Nathaniel's number with steady fingers.

He answered on the second ring, toddler balanced on one hip. "Miss me already?" His teasing tone sent shivers down her spine.

Watching from ten feet away, Evelyn whispered, "More than you know."

Nathaniel's grip tightened on the phone. Her uncharacteristic admission startled him.
###Chapter 433

Evelyn had never been this direct before. She never initiated calls either.

Nathaniel's low chuckle vibrated through the phone. "I'll return in three days. Some business still requires my attention here. Be patient, darling."

"Fine." Her reply was ice.

The line went dead abruptly. A child's wails for its mother had cut their conversation short.

The spark in Evelyn's eyes dimmed when she heard how distracted Nathaniel sounded. A bitter laugh escaped her lips. 'How could I be so naive?'

She'd always prided herself on rationality—unlike those women who lived solely for romance. She wasn't the type to fall blindly or trust easily. Yet here she was, painfully human.

Not even when Amelia flashed that cesarean scar, claiming Nathaniel fathered her child, had Evelyn doubted him. She'd dismissed it as lies meant to divide them.

'And I actually believed him to be honorable. That he'd never abandon his own flesh and blood. Yet he's standing right there while telling me he's overseas.'

The realization struck like a blade. Those two weeks he'd been "away"? Likely spent in the city, tending to Amelia and their child. 'Why the deception? If he wants her, he should say so. I wouldn't stand in his way.'

Evelyn understood perfectly. Their marriage was transactional—a performance for his family's benefit. She'd entertained no illusions until he'd suggested starting anew.

She knew the truth. Nathaniel only married her to appease his elders, who feared his entanglement with Amelia given their families' feud.

Seeing him cradle that child shattered remaining delusions. 'He never stopped loving her. That coldness toward Amelia? Just an act to convince his family.'

A fresh wave of self-loathing crested. 'I was merely a prop in his charade. He manipulated my feelings to strengthen his façade. Disgusting.'

Murmurs swirled around her.

"Look at that man with the baby! Gorgeous!"

"His wife just passed by—absolute stunner. Probably fetching medicine."

"What an adorable family!"

"With parents like that, of course the child's beautiful."

Each word lanced through Evelyn. She stared at the floor, drawing a shaky breath.

Sebastian's fists clenched. "Boss, let me teach that bastard—"

"No." Evelyn cut him off with a raised hand. "We're leaving."

"But that lying—"

Seraphina yanked him back. "Don't make this harder for her."

At that moment, Nathaniel turned abruptly, the child still in his arms, as if sensing their presence.
###Chapter 434

Nathaniel turned, but Evelyn and her companions had already vanished from the hospital corridor.

Was that her voice? I could’ve sworn I heard that little troublemaker just now.

Amelia returned with the medication. "Nathaniel, I have the baby’s medicine. We can leave now."

Nathaniel nodded. The toddler, already asleep against his shoulder, didn’t stir as the three of them headed toward the elevator.

Amelia glowed with pride, basking in the admiring glances from passersby. She tilted her head, studying the striking man holding her child.

This is it. My dream life—Nathaniel, me, and our baby. Together forever.

Evelyn, Seraphina, and Sebastian were back in the minivan.

Seraphina glanced at Evelyn through the rearview mirror. "Boss, where to?" she asked carefully.

"Take me back to the Grayson estate," Evelyn replied, her voice calm.

Sebastian frowned. "Why go back after what Nathaniel did to you?"

Evelyn’s gaze lingered on the passing scenery outside. "Our agreement was for three months. Today’s the last day. I’ll stay until midnight to fulfill my end."

Sebastian admired her integrity but sighed. "Boss… are you okay?"

Both he and Seraphina had seen the way Evelyn softened when she discovered her pregnancy. They knew she’d fallen for Nathaniel.

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Plenty of fish in the sea. This will pass."

"And the baby?"

"What happens, happens. Nathaniel has good genes. Consider it a free sperm donation." She leaned back, closing her eyes. "Wake me when we arrive."

Seraphina and Sebastian exchanged a helpless look but stayed silent.

Evelyn rested against the seat, but sleep wouldn’t come. She wouldn’t admit it aloud, but the ache in her chest was undeniable. Nathaniel had been kind, gentle—everything she never expected from a man. For once, she’d let herself believe she could rely on someone.

And now?

Just another lesson learned.

This pain is nothing compared to what I’ve survived before. It’ll fade.

Theodore greeted her the moment she stepped inside.

"Ma’am, have you eaten?"

Evelyn slipped into her indoor shoes. "Not yet. Could you ask the kitchen for something light?"

"Of course. I’ll have it sent to your room."

She nodded, already walking away. The house felt emptier than before.

But she wouldn’t let it break her.

Not again.
###Chapter 435

Evelyn nodded. "Thank you."

As always, she took her time climbing the stairs, but halfway up, she paused and turned back.

"By the way, Theodore. Have my things arrived?"

She had arranged for the engagement gifts she retrieved from the Blackwoods to be delivered to Nathaniel’s estate.

"Yes, ma’am. The maids have already stored them away. Would you like to inspect them?"

Evelyn waved a dismissive hand. "No need. Just inform Nathaniel when he returns."

"Of course, ma’am."

She continued up the stairs. The only reason she had reclaimed those extravagant gifts was to ensure she owed the Graysons nothing.

Theodore watched her ascend, a frown creasing his brow. Something about her seemed... off. But he couldn’t pinpoint what. Probably nothing, he decided, shaking off the thought before heading to the kitchen to oversee the preparation of her meal.

Before leaving, Nathaniel had given strict instructions regarding Evelyn’s dietary restrictions. Allergies made her meals a delicate affair, so Theodore personally tasted every dish before it reached her.

After a warm shower, Evelyn slipped into comfortable loungewear. She ate the lunch brought by the maid and then settled in for a nap. Lately, exhaustion clung to her like a second skin—now she knew why.

Pregnancy.

The moment her head touched the pillow, a wave of drowsiness pulled her under. I’ll miss this bed, she thought absently, already accustomed to its plush embrace.

Sleep claimed her as her mind wandered through half-formed plans for the future.

Night had fallen by the time she stirred. The wind howled outside, rattling the windows with its icy breath.

Theodore, jolted awake by the storm, immediately ordered the staff to secure every window. The last thing they needed was a draft disturbing Evelyn’s rest.

Then, headlights sliced through the darkness, their glow spilling across the estate’s manicured lawn. The growl of an engine grew louder.

Theodore squinted. Nathaniel’s car. Why is he returning at this hour?

Minutes later, Nathaniel strode inside, his coat dusted with the night’s chill.

"Welcome back, sir," Theodore greeted, taking the coat from him.

"Thank you. Where is she?"

Theodore didn’t need to ask who he meant. "Asleep, most likely."

Nathaniel gave a curt nod and brushed past him, taking the stairs two at a time.

Her call this morning had lingered in his mind all day. That rare admission—I missed you—had hooked into him, tugging him home despite the late hour.

He slowed as he reached her door, careful not to wake her. The knob turned easily in his hand. She didn’t lock it again.

A mix of exasperation and fondness twisted in his chest. He stepped inside, the room swallowed by shadows. No moonlight pierced the storm outside, leaving everything in eerie stillness.

"Hey, trouble," he murmured, sinking onto the edge of the bed. His gaze settled on the spot where she usually slept.

Silence.

Out cold, he thought, lips quirking.
###Chapter 436

Nathaniel didn't want to wake Evelyn from her dreams, so he quietly slipped out of bed and headed for the door. He needed a moment to clear his head in the study, but just as his fingers brushed the doorknob, a chilling realization struck him.

Something was wrong.

Why can't I hear her breathing?

His heart lurched violently. He flicked on the lights, scanning the room with sharp eyes. The bed was empty.

A cold dread settled in his chest as he yanked back the covers—nothing but rumpled sheets.

Where the hell is she?

He grabbed his phone and dialed her number, only to hear the familiar ringtone coming from the nightstand. The phone—his old one, now hers—lay abandoned.

She left without it?

A dark suspicion coiled in his gut. He strode to the wardrobe and flung it open.

Gone. Every last piece of her clothing had vanished.

His expression turned glacial. "Theodore!"

The butler rushed in, alarmed. "Yes, Mister Nathaniel?"

Nathaniel's voice was dangerously soft. "Where is she?"

Theodore's gaze darted around the room, landing on the half-empty wardrobe. His face paled. "Sir, Madam retired to her room after dinner. She hasn't been downstairs since. She's been fatigued lately, so she rests early. I instructed the staff not to disturb her."

Nathaniel's jaw clenched. "Then why are you still standing here? Find her. Don't come back until you do."

Theodore swallowed hard. "Understood, sir. We'll locate her immediately."

They searched all night. By dawn, there was still no trace of Evelyn.

Stranger still—the security footage showed no sign of her leaving.

Nathaniel sat motionless on the sofa, his eyes bloodshot, his presence radiating a lethal calm. He looked like a fallen god, one wrong word away from raining destruction.

She ran.

The realization burned. She had planned this meticulously—avoiding cameras, exploiting blind spots, leaving no trail.

Good. Very good, Evelyn Whitmore.

The servants stood frozen, bracing for his wrath.

Lucas hurried in, breathless. "Sir, we've checked airports, bus stations, hotels—nothing. The Whitmores claim she visited yesterday but only to return the engagement gifts you sent."

Nathaniel leaned back, pressing his fingers to his temples. Exhaustion, fury, and something darker twisted in his gaze.

Theodore spoke up carefully. "Sir, Madam had someone collect her belongings yesterday. I believe those were the gifts. They're in storage now."

Nathaniel's eyes narrowed to slits.

"She only took the paintings you gave her," Theodore added quietly.

A bitter smirk curled Nathaniel's lips.

She planned this perfectly.
###Chapter 437

Nathaniel's grip on the phone tightened until his knuckles turned white.

What kind of game is she playing? Does she really think she can just disappear on me? Not a chance, Evelyn Whitmore.

His voice was ice when he finally spoke. "Find her. I don't care where she is—search every corner of this earth if you have to. You don't stop until she's back in front of me."

Lucas swallowed hard, the chill in Nathaniel's tone sending a shiver down his spine. "Understood, sir."

A month later.

Thessa City.

One of the stops on Raphael Devereaux's highly anticipated world art tour.

The gallery entrance was pristine, its marble floors gleaming under soft lighting. A poised woman in a tailored suit stood by the doors, an orange silk scarf draped elegantly around her neck. Her smile was polished, practiced—until her gaze landed on the young woman approaching.

Evelyn wore a simple light blue shirt, faded jeans, and white sneakers. Casual. Comfortable. Entirely out of place among the gallery's elite patrons.

The woman's smile stiffened. "I'm sorry, miss, but I can't allow you inside."

Evelyn stopped. "Why not?"

The woman's lips pursed. "This exhibition is for serious buyers only. Given your... attire, I doubt you qualify."

Evelyn glanced at the sign outside. "It says 'open to the public.'"

"Free admission doesn't mean everyone gets in," the woman sniffed. "Our clientele expects a certain standard. You'd only disrupt the atmosphere."

Evelyn tilted her head. "And you're the one who decides who meets that standard?"

The woman's eyes raked over Evelyn's outfit with open disdain. Cheap fabric. No designer labels. Probably can't even afford a coffee here, let alone a painting.

"Miss," she said sharply, "I suggest you take a good look at yourself before wasting my time. If you have no business here, leave."

Evelyn didn't move. "My business is seeing the exhibition."

The woman scoffed. "Did you not notice everyone else is dressed appropriately? You'd stick out like a sore thumb. Our guests would question the gallery's reputation if we let someone like you wander around."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. "Since when does an art gallery have a dress code?"

The woman's patience snapped. "We do. Now, are you leaving, or do I call security?"

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Go ahead. Call them. Actually—why not get your manager while you're at it?"

The woman rolled her eyes. "Our manager is expecting VIP guests. He doesn't have time for—"

A deep voice cut her off. "Is there a problem here?"

The manager himself had just arrived.
###Chapter 438

"Must you scream like a banshee? Do you intend to disgrace our gallery by making a scene in front of our guests?" The gallery manager strode over, his voice sharp with disapproval.

The snobbish greeter instantly deflated at his arrival. "I'm sorry, sir. There's a woman causing trouble—she's dressed completely inappropriately, yet she insists on entering," she whined, feigning innocence.

The manager's gaze landed on Evelyn, and his expression shifted instantly. He bowed deeply, his tone dripping with servility. "Miss Whitmore! What an honor to have you here!"

The greeter blinked in shock. "Sir, who—?"

Evelyn smirked. "Yes, I'm here. Though it seems your gallery has a strict policy against people dressed like me."

The manager flushed, shooting a furious glare at the greeter before hastily apologizing. "My deepest apologies, Miss Whitmore. She's just a temporary hire—unfamiliar with our protocols. Please don't take offense. I assure you, she'll be dismissed immediately."

"I couldn't care less about your staffing decisions," Evelyn said coolly. "But art belongs to everyone, not just the wealthy. How someone chooses to dress is their own business. Your gallery shouldn't foster a culture that judges people by their clothes."

The manager bobbed his head eagerly. "Absolutely, Miss Whitmore. We'll take this as a learning opportunity and retrain our staff accordingly."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Am I allowed inside now?"

"Of course! Right this way, Miss Whitmore!" He gestured grandly, ushering her in.

She strolled past him, unhurried, while the greeter gaped after her.

"Sir," the greeter hissed once Evelyn was out of earshot, "who the hell is that woman?"

"Watch your tongue!" the manager snapped. "That is Miss Whitmore—our most distinguished guest. Cross her, and you'll regret it for the rest of your miserable life!"

The greeter paled. That was the VIP he'd been waiting for? This casually dressed nobody? "But she doesn’t look like she could afford a cup of coffee! Who is she?"

The manager sneered. "That’s none of your concern. Consider this your official termination. Collect your final paycheck from accounting and get out. We don’t employ shallow, classless fools like you."

Her jaw dropped. "Sir, please—I didn’t mean any harm! Give me another chance!"

He shook her off with disgust, brushing his sleeve where she'd touched him. Without another word, he turned on his heel and hurried back inside to mingle with the elite.

Fury and humiliation burned in the greeter’s chest, but she had no choice. Sniffling, she stormed off to accounting.

Inside, the gallery hummed with soft classical music. Most guests clustered around the famous pieces, murmuring praises.

Evelyn lingered in a quieter corner, studying a still-life painting with detached interest. Truthfully, commercial exhibitions like this bored her. She was only here for one reason: Raphael Devereaux.

According to Gregory, Raphael had been her mother’s art teacher—the only lead she had left. If anyone could tell her about Vivian Sterling, it was him.

Who was my mother? Who was chasing her? Is she even alive? The questions swirled relentlessly in her mind.

The manager reappeared, oozing deference. "Miss Whitmore, have any pieces caught your eye? I’d be delighted to share their histories with you."

Evelyn barely glanced at him. "Not yet. But tell me—when does Raphael arrive?"

The manager sighed. "Ah, I’m afraid there’s been a change of plans. Raphael was scheduled to attend, but his wife fell ill just before his flight. He’s staying in Phinacea to care for her. He won’t be visiting our country anytime soon."
###Chapter 439

Evelyn's brows furrowed. "He's tracking me?" This was bad news. International travel wasn't an option right now.

Nathaniel had scoured every corner of the city for her these past weeks. She knew he'd trace her the moment her passport flagged at any airport. For thirty days, she'd avoided using her own credit cards entirely. Every purchase went through either Sebastian's or Seraphina's accounts to throw him off her trail.

Playing the dutiful wife to appease Nathaniel's family had exhausted her. Her priority now was uncovering the truth about her mother - who she was, why she'd abandoned Evelyn all those years ago.

If Vivian Sterling still lived, Evelyn would move heaven and earth to find her.

If not... then someone would pay for what they'd done.

The gallery manager noticed Evelyn's distracted expression. "Miss Whitmore, if these pieces don't interest you, we have another collection by a different artist. Would you care to see them?"

Evelyn blinked back to the present. "Do you have any works by Vivian Sterling?"

The manager's eyebrows shot up. "Actually, we have two. Vivian was Raphael Devereaux's most celebrated protégé, so we always display some of her pieces with his exhibitions. Though few ask about her specifically." He lowered his voice. "Her style was... unconventional for the international scene. No one even knows her real name, and there's zero publicity about the artist. I'm surprised you recognized her work."

Evelyn offered no explanation. "Show me."

"Right this way, Miss Whitmore."

"These two pieces were painted during Vivian's university years," the manager gestured toward the wall. One painting showed a man's shadowy silhouette that triggered an odd sense of familiarity in Evelyn. The other depicted a breathtaking landscape in hyper-realistic detail.

"I'll take both," Evelyn said without hesitation.

The manager's smile widened at her lack of price inquiry. "Excellent choice. I'll have them prepared immediately."

As he hurried off, Evelyn studied the paintings. 'Mom painted these as a student. There's such warmth in her strokes... she must have been happy then. Is that shadow my father?'

"Miss Whitmore," a familiar voice interrupted her thoughts. "Long time no see."

Evelyn turned to face the strikingly handsome man standing behind her.
###Chapter 440

Jonathan's dark eyes twinkled with mischief as he flashed Evelyn a charming smile.

Evelyn's brows knitted together the moment she recognized him. "What are you doing here?"

Dressed in an impeccably fitted espresso-colored suit, Jonathan exuded aristocratic charm with a playful edge. "I heard two Vivian Sterling paintings were being exhibited," he said, leaning casually against the display case. "Thought I'd test my luck."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "Bad timing. I just purchased both pieces."

Undeterred, Jonathan closed the distance between them, his grin widening. "On the contrary, my luck's holding strong. I came hoping to see you, and here you are."

Her lips twitched in irritation. 'Still the same incorrigible flirt.'

Their last encounter replayed in her mind - how he'd refused to sell her the three Vivian Sterling paintings from his gallery, teasing her relentlessly until Nathaniel intervened. Of course Jonathan knew about her obsession with the artist's work.

Something else nagged at her - his long-standing friendship with Nathaniel made her suspicious. "You came specifically to see me? Why?"

Jonathan's gaze turned serious. "We need to talk."

"About?"

"How about lunch after the exhibition?" His voice softened. "It's been too long. We could catch up."

Evelyn remained unmoved. "Not interested. Say what you need to now or save it for never."

The hurt flickering across his face was genuine. "Evelyn, we're friends, aren't we?"

She recalled how he'd helped her after her pond incident, how she'd reluctantly agreed to friendship. "Technically."

"Is this how you treat all your friends?"

"Cut the games, Jonathan." Her patience wore thin. "Get to the point."

With a resigned sigh, he lowered his voice. "You're always so guarded around me. I only want to help."

"Help with what?"

He stepped closer, his intense gaze searching her face. "I don't know why, but I can tell you're searching for Vivian Sterling." His voice dropped to a whisper. "I might be able to assist with that."

Evelyn's posture stiffened. "You know where she is?"

Jonathan's mysterious smile returned as he deliberately avoided answering. "Now about that lunch invitation..."
###Chapter 441

Evelyn frowned. Even with Jonathan holding the information she desperately needed, hesitation still gnawed at her.

Jonathan smirked. "Relax. I won’t breathe a word about your location to the Graysons—Nathaniel included."

Her breath hitched. He’d read her hesitation effortlessly and sealed the deal with that promise. Now, she had no excuse to refuse.

"Fine," she conceded. "There’s a cozy little Korean BBQ spot I know. My treat."

The last thing she needed was some upscale restaurant where Nathaniel’s circle might lurk. Jonathan, in his tailored suit, screamed high society. A crowded, casual joint was safer—less chance of rumors sparking.

No one would mistake this for a date. Just two friends sharing a meal.

Jonathan’s eyes gleamed with amusement, as if he’d unraveled her plan. "Deal. Thanks for the free meal."

After leaving Sebastian’s address for the gallery to deliver the Vivian Sterling paintings, they headed out. The restaurant Evelyn chose was a bustling hotspot, alive with sizzling grills and chatter.

The moment they stepped in, whispers erupted. Women’s gazes latched onto Jonathan—drawn to his aristocratic aura but too intimidated to approach.

Under their stares, a waiter led them to their table. Evelyn scanned the menu, then slid it toward Jonathan. "Order whatever you want, Kind Sir."

His lips quirked at the nickname. Without hesitation, he marked several dishes—stir-fried octopus, spicy pork belly, kimchi stew.

Evelyn blinked. He navigated the menu like a regular.

Weird. Men like him didn’t frequent places like this. Most wouldn’t recognize half these dishes.

Yet here he was, ordering like a pro.

A memory flickered—Nathaniel’s first time here. He’d tried, for her sake, but discomfort had radiated off him.

Jonathan, though? Utterly at ease.

After finalizing their order, he poured her a glass of barley tea. Then, casually: "So, Evelyn. Rumor is you moved out of Nathaniel’s place a month ago. Does that mean you two are done?"
###Chapter 442

A month had passed since Evelyn left Nathaniel's life. During that time, hardly anyone dared to mention his name in her presence.

Seraphina and Sebastian must have discussed it privately and agreed to keep all mentions of Nathaniel away from her. They even went out of their way to avoid discussing any business dealings with the Grayson Group.

Evelyn told herself it shouldn’t matter. Nathaniel was nothing but a stranger to her now. Yet, despite that, a bitter taste still rose in her throat whenever his name was spoken.

She smirked, swirling the lemon water in her glass. "Kind Sir, do me a favor and never bring up that man’s name while I’m eating. It ruins my appetite."

Jonathan blinked, then chuckled, amusement dancing in his eyes. "Consider it done."

She hadn’t answered his question directly, but her reaction spoke volumes—she wanted nothing more to do with Nathaniel Grayson.

Evelyn took a long sip of the lemon water, savoring its crisp tang. Then, she set the glass down with a decisive clink. Time to get to the point.

"You mentioned earlier that you might be able to help me find Vivian Sterling. How exactly do you plan to do that?"

Jonathan poured himself a glass, taking his time before answering. "I don’t plan to help you find her."

The spark in Evelyn’s eyes dimmed instantly. Her brows furrowed. "Are you joking?"

He smirked. "Let me guess—you’re tempted to walk out right now."

She rolled her eyes. "Since I’m already here, I might as well finish my meal. But don’t ever trick me like this again. I don’t appreciate it."

Jonathan studied her, impressed. Most people would’ve stormed off in anger, but Evelyn knew how to hold her ground without making things awkward.

He liked that about her.

Deciding not to push her further, he leaned forward, his tone turning serious. "Evelyn, I didn’t trick you. I can’t help you find Vivian Sterling, but I can give you a crucial lead."

Her eyes sharpened. "What is it?"

"You don’t need to go through Raphael Devereaux to find her. There’s someone else who might be more useful."

"Who?"

"Samuel Rivers."

Evelyn’s grip on her fork tightened. Samuel Rivers? That arrogant, overprotective brother of Amelia?

Her frown deepened. "Why him? What does he have to do with Vivian Sterling?"

Just then, the waiter arrived with their food, placing the dishes between them before discreetly stepping away.

Jonathan served a portion onto Evelyn’s plate before continuing. "From what I know, Vivian Sterling was the pseudonym Samuel’s mother used for her paintings. His estate holds many of her unpublished works—including some of her most famous pieces."

Evelyn’s breath caught.

Her fork slipped from her fingers, clattering against the plate.

Vivian Sterling… was Samuel’s mother?

That meant—

Samuel was her son?
###Chapter 443

"So that means Samuel is my brother? How could we possibly share the same mother when he's so insufferable and cruel? This is—"

"Evelyn?" Jonathan signaled the waiter for a fresh fork before waving it playfully before her dazed eyes.

Evelyn blinked, snapping back to reality. Her brows furrowed as she studied him with grave intensity. "Jonathan, are you absolutely certain about what you just told me?"

"Positive! Remember when I mentioned meeting Vivian Sterling as a child? That's because she and my father were old friends. The three paintings in my gallery were gifts from her to my dad years ago."

A storm of emotions churned within Evelyn. 'If Vivian is Samuel's mother too, then I'm somehow tied to the Rivers family. Did they have something to do with my mother's disappearance?'

Noticing her troubled expression, Jonathan leaned forward. "Evelyn, may I ask why you're searching for Vivian Sterling?"

She remained silent, still processing the shocking revelation. Her thoughts were too tangled to reveal that Vivian was her missing mother.

When thirty seconds passed without response, Jonathan simply smiled. "It's alright. You don't have to share if you're not ready. But I have another question for you—may I?"

Evelyn's appetite had vanished. She sipped her lemon water. "Go ahead."

His gaze locked onto hers with startling intensity. "May I properly pursue you now?"

Evelyn nearly choked on her water before giving him an exasperated look. "Really, Jonathan? You came all the way to a Thssa gallery just to hit on me?"

All traces of humor vanished from his expression. "I'm completely serious, Evelyn. This isn't flirtation—I'm genuinely asking to court you with honorable intentions."

"Is there a difference?"

"Absolutely. Flirting is temporary amusement. Courting is done with marriage as the ultimate goal."

'Marriage? How laughable.' Evelyn's fingers tightened around her glass. 'Nathaniel said those same words once. Men are all alike—they chase women just to feed their own egos.'

"Before, you were technically Nathaniel's wife, and he's my friend. But now that you're both free..." Jonathan continued when she didn't respond. "There's nothing wrong with me expressing my feelings."

Evelyn speared a piece of duck. "I'm afraid the answer is no."

"Why?"

"I have neither the time nor inclination for romance. If you're looking for love, try someone else. With your looks, women probably line up for you."

He arched an eyebrow. "But I only want you."

As Evelyn opened her mouth to protest, he raised a hand. "Before you reject me completely, just promise you'll consider me if you ever change your mind. I'm willing to wait. All I ask is that when that day comes, you'll think of me first."

She stared at him incredulously. "Jonathan, what exactly do you see in me?"

His lips curved into that irresistible smile that probably melted hearts everywhere. "I can't explain it. I just know that I want you."
###Chapter 444

Their eyes locked for a solid ten seconds before Evelyn decided to finally eat the duck meat on her fork. She wiped her lips delicately and spoke. "Mister Ashford, I appreciate the information about Vivian Sterling. But until I verify its accuracy, I can't take it at face value. As for the other matter... let's revisit that conversation another time."

She's open to discussing it? Christopher hadn't expected this. At least there was still a glimmer of hope.

"Evelyn, I won't pressure you. But I hope I'll be the first person you think of when you need help."

She smiled faintly. "Still as kind as ever, Kind Sir. I'll remember that."

The only reason she hadn't outright rejected him was to avoid an endless debate. A vague promise bought her peace—for now.

Christopher's eyes lit up. "Then... would you mind exchanging numbers?"

After a brief hesitation, Evelyn handed him her phone. He blinked in surprise but quickly understood. He input his number, called himself, then saved her contact before returning the device.

"Thank you, Evelyn. You have no idea how happy this makes me."

She smirked. "Celebrate by eating more. Cold food loses its charm."

"I'd be happier if you called me Christopher."

"Noted, Kind Sir."

He chuckled, knowing she wouldn't bend so easily. They shifted to lighter topics as they finished their meal.

Outside the restaurant, a wall of TVs in an electronics store blared the same breaking news on loop:

[Heir to a global empire set to wed business tycoon's daughter—the corporate alliance of the century.]

The screens showed silhouettes of a man and woman. No names, no clear features, but anyone who knew them would recognize the pair instantly.

Christopher stiffened beside her. "Guess they finally wore down their families' objections."

Evelyn's lips curled into a mocking smile as she looked away. "I'll take my leave now. Goodbye, Kind Sir."

He caught her wrist. "When can I see you again?"

"Let's leave that to fate." She waved casually and walked off, her pace unhurried.

This time, he didn't follow. He watched her go, a cryptic smile playing on his lips.

Back at her apartment in Thessa, Sebastian was sprawled on the couch, gaming. He tossed his phone aside the moment she entered.

"Boss! You're back! Did you meet Raphael?"

Exhausted, Evelyn collapsed onto the sofa. "No."

"Then why were you gone so long?" Sebastian tilted his head.
###Chapter 445

"I ran into an old friend and we had lunch," Evelyn answered.

"A friend? Who?"

Evelyn rubbed her temples, then her gaze sharpened. "That's not important right now, Sebastian. I need you to dig into the Rivers family—especially Samuel Rivers. Get me everything you can find on him."

"On it, boss!" Without hesitation, he grabbed his phone and made the call.

Evelyn leaned back against the sofa, closing her eyes. At two months pregnant, exhaustion hit her harder than before. Her usual boundless energy had dulled.

For the past month, she'd been staying in Thssa with Sebastian while Seraphina managed things back in New Capital City. Occasionally, Seraphina would visit.

Despite her efforts, Evelyn had hit a dead end in tracing her mother’s identity. According to Gregory’s information, she’d combed through Thssa University’s records—but there was no trace of a student named Vivian Sterling, past or present.

She’d even called Gregory again to confirm, and he’d sworn the name was correct—Vivian Sterling, once the university’s most dazzling beauty.

With no other leads, Evelyn had hoped to meet Raphael Devereaux for more clues. But fate had other plans—his wife fell ill, and he couldn’t attend the exhibition.

Then, out of nowhere, Nathaniel dropped a bombshell about her mother.

Sebastian hung up, excitement in his voice. "Boss, I’ve got the details!"

Evelyn opened her eyes. "Go on."

He read from the report. "The Rivers family is one of New Capital City’s most prestigious lineages. Their ancestors were influential figures who shaped society. Samuel Rivers is the son of William Rivers and Vivian Sterling—who, by the way, comes from a powerful Thssa family."

Vivian Sterling. The name was too close to Vivian Sterling to be a coincidence. Gregory hadn’t been wrong—her mother must have used a nickname among friends.

"Keep going," Evelyn said after a pause.

"Later, Vivian Sterling was disowned when the Rivers discovered she’d had an affair and bore another man’s child. To avoid scandal, they declared both mother and daughter missing."

Evelyn’s frown deepened. "That’s impossible."

Her mother—kind, gentle—would never do such a thing. Sebastian fell silent, sensing her turmoil. He’d guessed the moment she asked about the Rivers that they were tied to her mother’s disappearance.

Evelyn pressed her fingers to her brow, then finally spoke. "Sebastian, check what positions are open at Rivers Group."

He blinked, then quickly searched. "Boss, they’re hiring a personal secretary for Samuel Rivers."

Her eyes narrowed. Decision made. "Pack your things. We’re returning to New Capital City tomorrow."

Sebastian’s face creased with worry. "You’re not seriously applying for that job, are you?"

"Absolutely."

"But Samuel’s notorious for being impossible to work with. And after everything that’s happened between you two—he’ll make your life hell."

"He’s my best shot at finding my mother," Evelyn said firmly. "I’ll take the risk."
###Chapter 446

Wealthy families like the Rivers were no different from any other elite dynasty. Money and reputation were their only priorities. With both secured, they could easily bury any scandal that threatened to surface.

Even if whispers of their private affairs leaked, no media outlet dared expose them. Only a select few held insider knowledge about the Rivers, and they knew better than to speak a word.

Under these circumstances, Evelyn had no choice but to step into the lion's den if she wanted answers. She had believed clearing her mother's name would be straightforward—after all, DNA tests confirmed she wasn't Gregory's child.

But now, with rumors swirling that she was the product of an affair, the situation had grown complicated. She refused to accept that her mother could have been a mistress. Determination burned in her chest—she would uncover the truth, restore her mother's honor, and make those who spread lies pay.

"Boss, aren't you worried the Graysons will find you if you return to New Capital City?" Sebastian asked, his voice laced with concern. "I have reliable intel that Mister Nathaniel is still searching for you."

"The best hiding spot is in plain sight. They won’t expect me to be right under their noses," Evelyn replied coolly. "And I won’t abandon my search for my mother just because of him."

A recent news segment flashed in her mind, and her lips curled into a bitter smirk. "What if he does find me? I owe him nothing. Besides, I heard he’s about to get engaged to Amelia. He’s probably hunting me down just to hand-deliver an invitation."

Sebastian’s surprise quickly turned to disgust. I actually thought he was a decent man—someone worthy of her. How wrong I was. Getting engaged barely a month after she left? At least Evelyn’s too sharp to have fallen for him.

"Alright, boss. I’ll pack our things and have Seraphina arrange transport."

"Thanks," Evelyn murmured, leaning back on the sofa and closing her eyes.

Better to have Seraphina handle it. Public transport leaves trails. She wasn’t afraid of Nathaniel finding her—she just wanted to avoid the inevitable chaos that followed every encounter with the Graysons.

A few days later.

Rivera Group Headquarters, HR Department.

Oliver Kingsley sat through interview after interview, his patience wearing thinner with each candidate. The position wasn’t just any job—it was executive secretary to the president. Standards were high.

Qualifications, appearance, and poise were all scrutinized. Those who passed Oliver’s screening would meet Samuel Rivers’ right-hand man for final approval.

So far, none had impressed him.

None of these people would last a day with Mister Rivers. It’s impossible to find someone competent, discreet, and without ulterior motives.

Most applicants were women dressed more for a gala than an interview. Their heavy makeup and calculated smiles did nothing to hide their real intentions.

They’re not here to work—they’re here to climb into Samuel Rivers’ bed. If I hire one of them, I’ll never hear the end of it.

The latest candidate, a woman with exaggerated curves and a plunging neckline, flipped her hair and flashed a practiced smile. Oliver barely glanced at her before waving her off. "Not suitable. Next!"

Seconds later, Evelyn walked in and took a seat.

By now, Oliver was exhausted by the parade of unqualified hopefuls. He rubbed his temples, barely looking up as he muttered, "Tell me, why did you apply for this position?"

Evelyn met his gaze evenly. "The pay is excellent."
###Chapter 447

Compared to the overly rehearsed responses from previous candidates, Evelyn's answer was refreshingly straightforward.

A sudden realization struck Oliver. That voice... why does it sound so familiar? He glanced up, and his eyes widened in shock. Evelyn Whitmore?!

Evelyn offered him a polite smile.

Oliver quickly schooled his expression, though his frown deepened. He reminded himself to stay cautious—after all, her history with both Nathaniel and Amelia was far from ideal.

"Miss Whitmore, what are you doing here?"

"Isn't it obvious? I'm here for the interview."

Oliver's frown turned into outright disapproval. "You want to be Mister Nathaniel’s executive secretary?"

Evelyn nodded without hesitation. "That’s right."

Oliver had no intention of hiring her. He suspected she was here to stir trouble for the Graysons, so he dismissed her coldly. "Given your past, I doubt Mister Nathaniel would approve of you in this position. You may leave. Next!"

Evelyn didn’t move. "And how exactly do you know what Mister Nathaniel would want?" she asked, her tone still pleasant.

Before Oliver could respond, she added, "Don’t tell me it’s just a hunch."

Oliver clenched his jaw.

Evelyn tilted her head. "That doesn’t sound very professional, does it? Shouldn’t an interviewer evaluate candidates based on their qualifications rather than personal bias?"

Oliver scoffed. "And what would you do in my position?"

Evelyn straightened. "At the very least, you should review my resume. If I’m unqualified, then give me a valid reason for rejection."

Oliver’s expression darkened. Unable to argue, he grudgingly flipped through her file.

Impressive academic background. Worked at a Fortune 500 company. There’s nothing here I can use to disqualify her.

He looked up sharply. "Why did you apply for this job again?"

Evelyn smirked. "The salary is excellent."

Oliver sneered. "So it’s just about the money? We don’t need someone with such shallow motives."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Then why do you work here? Out of pure passion? If money isn’t a factor, maybe you should volunteer your services for free. Show Mister Nathaniel how dedicated you are."

Oliver’s face flushed with anger. No one had ever spoken to him like this. "You have no respect!"

Evelyn chuckled. "They say life is a mirror. If you’re questioning my manners, perhaps you should examine your own."

Oliver gritted his teeth. "Your attitude is unacceptable for this role. Leave. Now."

Evelyn remained seated. "There’s no one else waiting. I’m the last candidate. Face it—you won’t find a 'perfect' secretary. Might as well pick me."

Oliver glared, debating whether to call security. But considering her past ties to Nathaniel, causing a scene might backfire.

After a tense silence, he stood abruptly. "Wait here."

He stormed out to call Nathaniel.

Nathaniel was in his office, skimming through emails when the call came. His fingers stilled as Oliver relayed the situation.

"Evelyn Whitmore is here for the interview?" His voice was dangerously calm.

"Yes. She refuses to leave unless she gets the job. Mister Nathaniel, I’ve never encountered someone so shameless."

Nathaniel’s lips curved slightly. "Bring her to my office."

Oliver hesitated. "Sir—"

"Now."

"...Yes, Mister Nathaniel."
###Chapter 448

Evelyn Whitmore waited as Oliver Kingsley ended the call.

"Miss Whitmore, come with me. Mr. Sinclair wishes to speak with you."

She wasn't surprised. Rising smoothly, Evelyn followed Oliver to Samuel's office. The space mirrored its owner - refined yet chillingly impersonal.

"Mr. Sinclair, I've brought Miss Whitmore as requested," Oliver announced with a slight bow.

The desk held several distinctive artifacts. Behind it, an imposing leather chair remained turned away despite Oliver's greeting.

After delivering Evelyn, Oliver exited without another word.

'His job's done,' Evelyn noted. She waited, but when Samuel didn't turn, she broke the silence. "Mr. Sinclair, I'm Evelyn Whitmore. I'm applying for the executive secretary position."

Several beats passed before the chair slowly rotated. Samuel cradled a steaming coffee cup, his aristocratic features schooled in detached amusement. His smile didn't reach his cold gray eyes.

"Miss Whitmore. What an unexpected... pleasure." He took a deliberate sip. "What game are you playing now? Why suddenly apply to work for me?"

"The salary's substantial, and I need money. Simple as that."

Samuel's chuckle held no warmth. "I recall you being the type to refuse handouts. You returned my check quite dramatically last time. Regretting that noble gesture?"

Evelyn met his gaze steadily. "I never claimed disinterest in money. I simply dislike charity from people who use it to stroke their egos. Let's move past that, shall we? I'm not here begging. I'm offering my skills in exchange for fair compensation."

Samuel studied her through narrowed eyes. "You actually believe you're qualified?"

"Try me and find out."

He looked away, swirling his coffee. "No thank you. This company has no use for wildcards. Seek employment elsewhere."

Evelyn's fingers tightened imperceptibly. The knowledge that this arrogant man shared her blood made her skin crawl. Only her mother's secrets kept her seated. She wouldn't leave without securing this position - that much she vowed.
###Chapter 449

Evelyn strode confidently to the desk and pulled out a chair without waiting for permission. The leather seat creaked as she settled into it.

"Mr. Sinclair, I strongly advise you to rethink your decision."

Samuel's brows knitted together. Her audacity to sit uninvited irritated him. "Give me one good reason."

She met his gaze squarely. "While waiting for my turn, I observed every candidate who entered. None of those women actually wanted the job." Her fingers tapped the armrest. "They were all hoping to catch your attention. Surely you don't want a secretary whose main qualification is bedroom eyes?"

Samuel's lips twisted into a cold smirk. "Clever observation, Miss Whitmore. But rejecting them doesn't automatically mean I'll hire you. I could simply choose a male candidate instead."

Evelyn had anticipated this response. A knowing smile played on her lips. "There were male applicants too. I overheard them discussing your physique, speculating about your preferences." She leaned forward slightly. "Between fawning women and swooning men, which would you rather tolerate daily?"

The coffee cup in Samuel's hand trembled slightly. This infuriating woman had successfully gotten under his skin again. "Fair point. But how do I know you're not just playing hard to get? That you won't eventually try the same tactic?"

Her eyes locked onto his with startling intensity. A flicker of distaste crossed her features. "Mr. Sinclair, you can take this to the bank - I have zero interest in you romantically. No amount of charm or good looks could change that."

Samuel nearly choked on his coffee. He set the cup down with a sharp clink. "And why is that, exactly?"

"Simple." Her answer came without hesitation. "I can't stand you."

The blunt declaration caught him off guard. In all his years, no woman had ever said those words to him.

"Likewise," he retorted dryly. "If you despise me so much, why pursue this position? Isn't that contradictory?"

Evelyn shook her head. "I dislike you personally. That has nothing to do with your company or this job opportunity." She straightened her posture. "I'm perfectly capable of separating professional and personal matters. Give me a trial period if you doubt me. I guarantee my performance will exceed expectations. And I double guarantee I'll never end up in your bed."

Samuel found himself at a loss for words. Each encounter with this woman brought fresh surprises. It wasn't that he disliked her - he simply couldn't forgive how she'd treated Amelia. Yet he couldn't deny her boldness intrigued him.

Beyond her striking beauty, Evelyn possessed a maturity that belied her youthful appearance. Her fearless attitude would undoubtedly set her apart in the corporate world.

'I'm curious to see how far that attitude will take her,' Samuel mused.

A sharp knock interrupted his thoughts. Oliver's voice carried through the door. "Mr. Sinclair? Miss Rivers and Mr. Grayson are here to see you."

Evelyn's composure shattered instantly. All color drained from her face. She sprang to her feet, clearly ready to bolt.

'What the hell? Amelia showing up makes sense, but why is Nathaniel here?' The question screamed through her mind as she scanned the room for an exit.
###Chapter 450

Evelyn's breath hitched. 'If I step out now, I'll run straight into Amelia and Nathaniel! What the hell am I supposed to do?'

Samuel observed Evelyn's panicked expression with amusement. 'She's far more entertaining like this than when she's putting on that icy facade,' he mused. With a mocking smirk, he drawled, "Well, well. The unshakable Evelyn Whitmore actually knows how to panic."

Evelyn shot him a glare. She had zero patience for Samuel's taunts right now. 'Damn it! Of all the scenarios I prepared for, this wasn't one of them.'

She'd been banking on the long-standing feud between the Graysons and Rivers families. That animosity had always ensured Nathaniel would never set foot in this building. The tension between Nathaniel and Samuel whenever they occupied the same space had been palpable.

'One month away and suddenly they're all buddy-buddy? Did the family elders finally bury the hatchet?' Evelyn's nails dug into her palms. 'That would explain the sudden engagement announcement.'

Samuel's eyes narrowed. Without sparing a thought for Evelyn's predicament, he ordered Oliver, "Let them in."

"Yes, Mr. Samuel."

'Shit!' Evelyn's eyes darted around the office as the door began to creak open. Anywhere but here. She couldn't face Nathaniel now—not like this.

Before Samuel could object, she bolted behind the massive bookshelf flanking his desk. Only when fully concealed did she allow herself a shaky exhale.

Amelia's melodic voice filled the room moments later. "Samuel, you sounded so urgent on the phone. Is everything alright?"

Her tone was sweet as honey, dripping with innocent concern.

Samuel's entire demeanor softened—a stark contrast to his earlier sarcasm. "Just missed my baby sister. You've been spending every waking moment with Nathaniel lately. Starting to think you've forgotten you have brothers."

A playful pout colored his words, though a thread of genuine jealousy ran beneath them.

Amelia giggled, rounding the desk to perch on Samuel's lap. "That's not true! I come home every night."

"At midnight," Samuel countered, wrapping protective arms around her. "You leave before sunrise and don't return until the stars are out. Might as well be living elsewhere."

Amelia buried her face in his shoulder. "I've just been... preoccupied."

"Preoccupied with your fiancé, you mean." Samuel ruffled her hair before lifting his gaze to the silent observer by the door. "Nathaniel. Thanks for bringing her."

Nathaniel inclined his head slightly, hands tucked casually in his tailored slacks. "No trouble."

The sound of his voice sent a physical jolt through Evelyn. A month without hearing that deep timbre, and now it wrapped around her like a vice. Her chest constricted painfully.

Through the reflection on his computer monitor, Samuel caught sight of Evelyn's hiding spot. A wicked grin curled his lips.

"Nathaniel, since you're here—let's discuss your engagement to Amelia. Got time for that now?"
###Chapter 451

Nathaniel glanced at his wristwatch. "Perfect timing."

Samuel lifted Amelia off his lap, rising with effortless grace before slipping into his tailored jacket. "Then it's settled. The three of us will finalize the engagement details over lunch."

"Fine," Nathaniel replied flatly.

Meanwhile, Evelyn—still concealed behind the towering bookshelf, her hand resting protectively over her barely-there bump—felt her stomach twist.

Her lips curled into a bitter smile.

So they're discussing Nathaniel and Amelia's engagement now? Of course their families won't object. Not when they already share a child. Maybe this is their chance to finally play happy family.

Samuel draped an arm around Amelia's shoulders, guiding her toward the door when he suddenly halted. "Nathaniel, would you mind escorting Amelia to the restaurant first? I just recalled an urgent matter. I'll have Oliver reserve a table. Go ahead without me—I'll join you shortly."

Nathaniel gave a curt nod. He couldn't care less.

"Of course, Samuel," Amelia chirped, batting her lashes. "Don't keep us waiting too long."

Samuel flashed her a charming grin. "Wouldn't dream of it."

Evelyn exhaled shakily as their footsteps faded. Finally. They're gone.

Then, without warning, nausea surged. She clamped a hand over her mouth, swallowing hard. Not now. Stay quiet.

But the sickness clawed its way up, relentless. Stress and exhaustion had worsened her symptoms.

Damn it—

A choked cough escaped her.

Nathaniel froze mid-step, his fingers inches from the door handle. His entire body went rigid.

That voice—

Amelia spun around, eyes wide. "Samuel, who was that? Is someone else here?"

Samuel barely spared the bookshelf a glance. "You must be imagining things."

"No, I heard it!" Amelia's grin turned mischievous. "Are you hiding a woman in here?" She practically skipped toward the shelves. "Let's see who's—"

Samuel didn't stop her. Explaining Evelyn's presence would be tedious, but it hardly mattered now.

Evelyn's pulse spiked. Shit.

Amelia peered behind the shelf—and her smirk vanished.

For a full minute, she stood frozen, her doe eyes darkening with shock, then venom.

What the hell is SHE doing here?
###Chapter 452

Evelyn's eyes burned with pure venom as she glared at Amelia. "What the hell is Amelia doing in Samuel's office?"

"What new scheme is she plotting now?"

Amelia met her gaze without flinching.

The steady rhythm of approaching footsteps echoed through the room.

Evelyn knew Nathaniel was coming to investigate. She couldn't let him see Amelia here.

A sly smile curled her lips as she announced loudly, "Oh Samuel, you never told me you got an office cat! The poor thing was choking on some dried fish earlier."

"Thankfully it coughed it up. Would've been tragic if we lost the little furball. You really should know better than to feed such treats to kittens."

Samuel's eyes narrowed in understanding. "My mistake," he drawled. "First-time pet owner here. I'll be more careful."

Evelyn smirked when he played along. She shot Amelia one last warning look before intercepting Nathaniel.

"Darling, the kitten's still skittish around people," she cooed, blocking his path. "Best not frighten it further."

Nathaniel studied her, then glanced skeptically at the bookshelf. Amelia held her breath, fighting another wave of nausea.

She forced out two soft meows to sell the ruse. "Meow... meow..."

"I'm starving," Evelyn announced brightly. "Samuel, Nathaniel and I will head to the restaurant first. Join us when you're done." She tugged Nathaniel's sleeve. "Let's go, darling."

The light in Nathaniel's eyes dimmed at the feline sounds. With one last glance at the bookshelf, he followed Evelyn out.

Samuel collapsed into his chair with a sigh. "Coast's clear, kitten."

Amelia emerged, her composure restored.

Samuel tilted his head. "Care to explain the hide-and-seek?"

"Just avoiding an unpleasant encounter," Amelia replied airily.

"With Nathaniel?" Samuel pressed. "Why?"

"That's my business." Amelia crossed her arms. "Besides, your sister clearly didn't want him seeing me either."

Samuel lounged like a king on his throne, effortlessly regal yet intimidating. "Miss Whitmore, you've seen how close Evelyn and Nathaniel are. Use that brilliant mind of yours to stay away. Interfering would be... unwise."

Amelia's frown deepened. 'When did I ever interfere? Nathaniel forced me into that marriage. Yes, I fell for his lies during those three months - when he claimed to only see Evelyn as a lifesaver, nothing more. I was a fool to believe him, but—'
###Chapter 453

Evelyn was too exhausted to explain herself. Instead, she asked, "So you're fine with Amelia getting engaged to someone from the Grayson family?"

A resigned expression crossed Samuel's face. "Given my family's stance on this, I personally don't want to see them married. My elders will make my life hell if they do. But my sister is stubborn—she won't let Nathaniel go. It's like she'll wither away without him. As her brother, my job is to protect her and ensure she gets her happily ever after with the man she loves." His voice hardened. "I won't forgive anyone who tries to hurt her. I hope you understand where I'm coming from, Miss Whitmore."

Evelyn studied Samuel quietly before smiling faintly. "I do understand. She's lucky to have a brother like you."

Samuel couldn't tell if her words were genuine, but it didn’t matter. He’d done his part—warning her to stay away from Nathaniel. If she interfered again, he wouldn’t hesitate to act.

His love for Amelia was twofold—overflowing from the love he could no longer give to Celeste. The guilt of failing to protect his mother and sister fifteen years ago haunted him. He’d sworn never to fail Amelia the same way.

And Evelyn? She kept hurting Amelia. That was unforgivable.

As Evelyn stepped away from the bookshelf, she found herself near Samuel’s desk. She hadn’t meant to pry, but something caught her eye—a photograph.

A woman with warm eyes and a gentle smile held a little girl in her arms. Beside them stood a boy, grinning at the camera.

Evelyn’s breath hitched. That woman… she looks familiar. Could she be—

Her heart clenched. The blurry fragments of her mother’s face in her memories suddenly sharpened.

Tears pricked her eyes.

Samuel noticed her stillness. His gaze flicked to the photo frame before he snatched it away, turning it face-down.

"Miss Whitmore, you may leave now. Oliver, see her out."

"Yes, Mr. Samuel." Oliver stepped in but hesitated. "Sir, we have an urgent issue with the Almerian client."

Samuel frowned. "What happened?"

"The translator we provided wasn’t proficient enough. The client rejected their work and demanded a replacement immediately. The ones available in the city don’t meet their standards, and the qualified ones won’t arrive in time. The client is threatening to leave."

Samuel’s jaw tightened—a rare sign of frustration.

Evelyn tilted her head. "If you’re desperate, I could give it a try."
###Chapter 454

Samuel and Oliver studied her simultaneously.

A beat passed before Samuel arched a brow. "You speak Almerian?"

Evelyn's lips curved. "Enough to get by."

Oliver scoffed internally. This woman would say anything to get what she wants. His earlier professional respect for her evaporated.

"Miss Whitmore," he said coolly, "this position requires fluency. Casual greetings don't qualify. Please refrain from interrupting." Her resume listed no foreign languages—why would she hide such a skill if she truly possessed it?

Evelyn remained unruffled. "I may not be native-level, but I'm confident I can assist your client."

Oliver ignored her, turning to Samuel. "Sir, what's our move?"

Samuel had already dismissed Evelyn, scanning his computer for alternative solutions. Like Oliver, he assumed she was meddling to complicate matters further.

Recognizing their skepticism, Evelyn stepped forward. "Mr. Rivers, your dilemma is clear: lose the client without a translator or take a chance on me. What do you have to lose?"

Samuel's gaze turned glacial. "This isn't a playground, Miss Whitmore."

"Does my expression suggest I'm playing?" She tilted her head. "Here's my offer: if I secure the client, hire me as your executive secretary. If I fail, I vanish permanently—no more interference with Amelia or Nathaniel. Deal?"

Truthfully, she disliked Samuel intensely. Shared blood meant nothing when he sneered at those beneath his social tier.

But the photo of her mother on his desk had sealed her resolve. Staying at Rivers Group meant uncovering the truth.

Samuel studied her for a long moment. Then, unexpectedly, he smiled. "Fine. Oliver, take her to the client."

Oliver gaped. "Sir, I don't—"

This is madness. She's bluffing. Is he really gambling their business on her?

Samuel was dead serious. Worst-case scenario? They'd lose one client—hardly catastrophic. Finding another translator in time was impossible anyway. And Evelyn's promise to disappear if she failed? That alone made the gamble worthwhile.

He sipped his coffee. "Oliver, if she fails, don't bring her back. This company has no room for arrogance masquerading as competence."
###Chapter 455

"Yes, Mister Samuel."

Oliver had no option but to comply with Samuel's order. He turned, shot Evelyn a disdainful glare, and snapped, "Miss Whitmore, follow me."

Evelyn gave a lazy nod, stretching slightly before trailing behind him out of the office.

At the Almerian clients' hotel.

Three men dressed in traditional Almerian attire sat in the restaurant downstairs, conversing in their native tongue. Their expressions were tense, voices sharp with frustration as they discussed whatever had angered them.

Oliver halted a short distance away, shoving a folder into Evelyn's hands. "Those three are our clients. Need me to introduce you?" he asked icily.

Evelyn waved him off. "I've got it."

Relief flickered across Oliver's face—he had no intention of accompanying her anyway. The last thing he wanted was to witness the inevitable disaster when this arrogant woman embarrassed herself in front of their most important clients.

In his mind, the deal was already lost. Samuel was clearly using this as an excuse to rid himself of Evelyn once and for all.

Evelyn skimmed the documents swiftly, absorbing the key details. Then, without hesitation, she strode toward the Almerian delegation and greeted them in flawless Almerian.

Oliver, who didn't understand a word, settled at a nearby table to observe.

At first, the three men remained visibly irritated—likely still fuming over their previous incompetent translator. But the moment Evelyn spoke, their scowls melted into surprised smiles.

They gestured for her to join them, their earlier hostility replaced by warm hospitality. Evelyn accepted gracefully, and soon, the four were engaged in lively conversation.

Oliver's jaw nearly hit the floor. He rubbed his eyes, certain he was hallucinating. But no—Evelyn was effortlessly winning them over. His opinion of her shifted instantly.

She's actually pulling this off!

Meanwhile, at Celestial Bloom.

The maître d' brightened the second Samuel entered. "Welcome, Mister Rivers! Mister Grayson and Miss Amelia are waiting at your usual table. Right this way."

Samuel followed him to the private dining area.

Amelia was mid-sentence when she spotted him, breaking into a grin. "There you are! We were starting to think you'd stood us up."

A waiter pulled out his chair, and Samuel took his seat beside her.

After placing their orders, Samuel dismissed the staff with a subtle gesture. His gaze landed on Nathaniel, who was meticulously cutting his steak across the table.

"Apologies for the delay," Samuel said smoothly.
###Chapter 456

Nathaniel's voice was cool and detached. "No, the food just arrived."

Samuel flashed a knowing smile. The table fell into focused silence as everyone began eating.

Amelia beamed with delight. She carefully sliced a portion of foie gras onto her plate, then lifted it tenderly toward Nathaniel's lips. "Darling, you must try this," she cooed. "It's far superior to what we had in Almeria last month. The texture is absolutely divine - like velvet dissolving on your tongue!"

"Not interested. Enjoy it yourself."

Nathaniel didn't even glance her way. His attention remained fixed on cutting his steak with surgical precision, savoring each bite with deliberate concentration.

Amelia's smile faltered. Her outstretched hand hovered awkwardly in midair.

Retracting the offering would appear childish. After a calculated pause, she used her knife to transfer the morsel to the edge of Nathaniel's plate. "Just one bite? I promise you won't regret it."

A noncommittal hum was his only response. The foie gras remained untouched as Nathaniel continued methodically consuming his rare steak.

Samuel's expression darkened witnessing his sister's unreciprocated affection. The sight of Amelia's forced cheerfulness twisted something in his chest.

He hated seeing her diminished like this, yet understood her devotion to this emotionally unavailable man was unshakable.

Masking his irritation, Samuel intervened smoothly. "That foie gras looks incredible. Mind if I try some?"

Amelia's tension visibly eased. She brightened immediately, serving Samuel a fresh portion. "Here, brother. Tell me what you think."

Samuel made a show of enjoying every bite. "Exquisite. Nathaniel, you're missing out."

The pointed comment carried an edge beneath its pleasant tone. How hard was it to humor Amelia with one polite taste?

Nathaniel remained unmoved, ignoring both the food and the subtle challenge. He set down his utensils with finality. "Samuel, let's discuss whatever brought you here."

Samuel's jaw tightened imperceptibly. He turned to Amelia instead. "Sister, I brought those lemon cheesecakes you adore from Patisserie Royale. They're in the car - why don't you fetch them?"

He pressed his keys into her palm.

Amelia understood the dismissal instantly. Her protective older brother wanted privacy with Nathaniel.

Samuel had always championed her happiness. After learning she'd never consider another man, he'd reluctantly supported her pursuit of Nathaniel despite his reservations.

This conversation could only mean one thing - Samuel was strategizing how to secure her future with Nathaniel.

"Of course," she agreed readily. "Nathaniel, we'll have dessert together when I return. Their lemon cheesecake is heavenly."

Nathaniel offered only a curt nod, his expression as inscrutable as ever.
###Chapter 457

Amelia rose from her chair to fetch the dessert.

Samuel observed his sister's departure before turning his attention to Nathaniel, seated opposite him. His expression grew solemn.

"Nathaniel, don't you think you're being too distant with Amelia?"

Nathaniel lifted his gaze. "Have we just met yesterday?"

Samuel fell silent.

The truth stung. They'd known each other since childhood, moving in the same elite circles.

Nathaniel had always been this way - aloof, detached, never one for unnecessary warmth.

Yet the thought of his beloved sister marrying this emotionally unavailable man made Samuel's chest tighten. What did Amelia possibly see in him?

Abandoning his earlier frustration, Samuel got straight to the point.

"Nathaniel, I'm aware you and Amelia secretly adopted a child overseas without informing either family."

Nathaniel's knife hesitated momentarily against his steak before resuming its methodical motion.

Samuel pressed on. "Amelia left home abruptly and only returned recently because she was caring for that child. Correct?"

Nathaniel's expression remained impassive. Only after deliberately swallowing his bite did he respond. "I apologize for proceeding without the Rivers family's consent."

Samuel's eyes hardened. "I'm not here for apologies, Nathaniel. What's done is done - we'll raise the child as our own. But you need to clarify your relationship with my sister. This ambiguity can't continue."

Nathaniel set down his utensils with deliberate calm, dabbing his lips with a napkin before meeting Samuel's gaze squarely. "There is no ambiguity. Amelia will always hold a special place in my life as the person who saved me. I respect her, support her, and consider her a dear friend. Nothing more."

Samuel barked a humorless laugh. "A dear friend? Since when do friends adopt children together?"

Nathaniel's long fingers curled around his water glass. "To be frank, I agree it was inappropriate. But Amelia was insistent - desperate to experience motherhood, begging me to accompany her. I agreed after careful consideration."

Samuel's face darkened. "You say that as if you're merely an observer. Don't pretend you don't know why a young woman like Amelia would rush into adoption. Need I remind you she lost the ability to bear children because of you?"

At this, Nathaniel's composed mask finally cracked, his brow furrowing with visible discomfort.
###Chapter 458

Samuel's voice was sharp with accusation. "It's Amelia who saved you back then! That snake venom destroyed her body—robbed her of ever becoming a mother!"

His fists clenched. "You know exactly what that means for a woman. The pain, the grief, the shattered dreams!"

Nathaniel remained silent, jaw tight.

Every word was true.

Fifteen years ago, he'd been bleeding out in the bushes of a remote village, snake venom burning through his veins. Blind, helpless, dying.

Then a girl appeared. She sucked the poison from his wound, spat it out—but not fast enough. The venom had already seeped into her.

Later, she found him again—Amelia Rivers, the second daughter of the Rivers family, staying at their countryside estate.

The damage was irreversible. The venom had stolen her fertility.

Guilt had shackled him ever since. He gave her everything—money, favors, protection. Whatever she asked.

A month ago, she'd come to him in tears.

"I saw an old classmate today," she'd whispered. "She's married. Pregnant. I want that, Nathaniel. Just once. Just to know what it feels like."

She begged him to help her adopt. Somewhere discreet, where no one would ask questions.

Kecharia.

A poor country with lax adoption laws. No marriage certificate needed. No family interference.

He'd hesitated. But the guilt won.

They spent two weeks there, finalizing the paperwork. The boy—Joey—was quiet, wary. On the flight home, he developed a fever.

They rushed him to the hospital.

That was the night Evelyn called.

The night she vanished.

Nathaniel's knuckles whitened.

Samuel exhaled sharply. "An adoption won't fix this, Nathaniel. Amelia's dream was always you. Only you can give her happiness."

A bitter laugh escaped him. "Even with our families' feud, I'd make peace for her sake. Can't you do the same?"

Nathaniel finally met his gaze. Cold. Unreadable.

"I'm already married, Samuel. Bigamy isn't legal."

Samuel scoffed.

"Married? To Evelyn?" His lip curled. "Please. That was never real. You only brought her home to pacify your grandfather before his surgery."
###Chapter 459

Nathaniel was right, but Samuel remained composed.

"We didn't file the paperwork in time, but we had a ceremony. In the eyes of the law, it was a real marriage."

"Samuel, I know you're concerned about your sister. I'll spend the rest of my life making up for what she sacrificed for me. But the one thing I can't give her is marriage—or your definition of happiness. I'm sorry."

With that, Nathaniel checked his watch. "Lunch is over. I have a meeting this afternoon, so I'll take my leave now."

He stood and walked away without hesitation, leaving no room for debate.

His cold indifference finally shattered Samuel's restraint. He slammed his hands on the table. "Nathaniel! Do you even have a heart?"

Just then, Amelia returned with the cake. She blinked in confusion at the sight of Nathaniel leaving and her brother's anger. "What's going on? Nathaniel, where are you going? I brought dessert!"

"No need. I have business to attend to." Nathaniel pocketed his hands, brushing past her without a glance. His long strides carried him out before she could protest.

"Nathaniel!" she called after him, but he didn't turn back.

Her shoulders slumped as she watched him disappear through the restaurant doors. Then she whirled on Samuel, eyes flashing with hurt. "What did you say to him? Why did he leave like that?"

Samuel forced his anger down, softening his tone for her sake. "It's nothing urgent. Just a company matter. Come, sit. Let's enjoy the cake."

How could he tell her the man she loved refused to marry her?

Amelia picked at her dessert, the sweetness turning to ash in her mouth. Then she remembered something. "Oh, Samuel—why was Evelyn in your office earlier? She was hiding behind your bookshelf like she was up to no good! I pretended not to see her."

Samuel didn't see a reason to lie. "She applied to be my secretary today."

Amelia's fork clattered onto her plate. "What? You hired her?"

Before Samuel could answer, his phone rang. Oliver's name flashed on the screen.

Samuel smirked, assuming the Almerian client had rejected their proposal and left. Losing such a lucrative deal was unfortunate, but not catastrophic.

He answered, but Oliver's excited voice cut him off. "Sir, it's done! Evelyn secured the deal! The Almerians are signing a ten-year contract with us tomorrow!"
###Chapter 460

Ten years?

Almeria's mineral reserves were the envy of global corporations. Powerful nations had been vying for a piece of this lucrative partnership, which was why the Almerian representative had always carried himself with unshakable arrogance. Negotiating with him was notoriously difficult.

Initially, the Sinclair Group had aimed for a five-year contract.

But the Almerian crown prince refused. Three years was his absolute limit, with terms to be renegotiated afterward.

Even securing those three years had been a struggle. Yet Evelyn had returned in under an hour with a decade-long agreement.

Samuel blinked, momentarily stunned. "She speaks Almerian?"

Oliver answered without hesitation. "Fluently. And with enough wit to have the representative laughing throughout the entire meeting. Sir, Miss Whitmore wants to know what time she should report tomorrow."

Samuel tilted his head, considering. "Tell her to come in the morning. Once the ten-year contract is officially signed, she can start."

"Yes, sir."

Oliver, who had initially doubted Evelyn the most, now found himself reluctantly impressed.

After hanging up, Samuel—usually unreadable—wore an expression of quiet disbelief.

Amelia noticed. A flicker of unease passed through her. "Samuel," she began carefully, "who were you just talking about hiring? You're not seriously making Evelyn your secretary, are you?"

Samuel snapped back to attention. "She's proven herself capable. If she's qualified, why not?"

With Evelyn having secured the Almerian deal, it made sense for her to oversee its execution. It eliminated any risk of miscommunication.

Amelia hadn't expected this. Her guard went up instantly, but she forced a sweet smile. "Evelyn is clever, no doubt. She'd be an asset. But..." She hesitated, feigning concern. "Her temperament isn't suited for a secretary's role. Compliance is key in that position. Maybe reconsider?"

Samuel ruffled her hair affectionately. "I know what I'm doing. Don't worry."

He understood her real concern. Evelyn's presence unsettled Amelia, who was already struggling to win Nathaniel's affection.

Hiring Evelyn was purely strategic. But keeping her close also meant keeping her away from Nathaniel.

Amelia's smile tightened. "Alright."

Samuel leaned back, sipping his water. "How's the child?"

Amelia froze. "W-what child?"

He fixed her with a knowing look. "The one you and Nathaniel adopted overseas. How long did you plan to hide it from me?"

Realizing the jig was up, she sighed dramatically. "You already know?"

Samuel smirked. "You've been sneaking around for a month. Did you really think I wouldn't notice? I had Oliver track your movements."

Tears welled in Amelia's eyes. "Samuel, you know my dream has always been to marry the man I love, have children, and build a family."

Her voice trembled with practiced vulnerability.

Samuel watched her, silent.

The game continued.
###Chapter 461

"But I can't have children anymore, so I decided to adopt."

Amelia's voice trembled as she spoke, her fingers tightening around the edge of the table.

Samuel's heart ached at the sight of his sister's sorrow. How could he possibly reprimand her now?

He exhaled slowly, pulling her into a gentle embrace. "I understand. Bring the boy home tomorrow. It's not right to keep him away, and you're exhausting yourself going back and forth every day."

Amelia's eyes widened in surprise. "Really? You mean it? What if Father and Mother get angry? I'm... I'm scared."

Samuel took a napkin, dabbing away the tears clinging to her lashes. "Don't be. They know about your condition. They'll understand—they just need time to adjust."

His voice softened, though his tone carried a hint of reprimand. "But Amelia, you should have discussed this with us first. Adopting a child isn't something you do on a whim."

She buried her face against his shoulder. "I know. But you'll always stand by me, won't you? No matter what?"

"Always," he answered without hesitation.

A small smile tugged at her lips. "Ethan is growing so fast these days. I'll buy him new clothes—something adorable. Once Mother and Father see him, they'll adore him instantly!"

She prattled on, her excitement bubbling over as she described every little detail about the boy.

But beneath her cheerful facade, frustration simmered.

Days ago, she'd discreetly leaked rumors to the press—hinting at an impending engagement between her and Nathaniel.

It was meant to pressure him. To force their families into action.

And, of course, to send a clear message to her—Evelyn Whitmore—that she had no place in Nathaniel's life anymore.

Yet, Nathaniel had swiftly erased every trace of those rumors.

And from the tension in Samuel's earlier conversation with him, it was clear Nathaniel had no intention of marrying her.

Not when she had returned.

Evelyn had left once. Why did she have to come back?

And now, of all things, she had the audacity to apply as Samuel's secretary.

Whatever game Evelyn was playing, Amelia wouldn't let her win.

Inside the Rivera Group, Evelyn would be under her control.

And whatever awaited her there... Amelia would make sure it was nothing short of hell.

A flicker of something dark passed through her otherwise innocent gaze.

We'll see about that.

The next morning, Evelyn arrived at the Rivera Group to begin her first day of work.
###Chapter 462

Nathaniel signed the contract with a satisfied smile, shaking hands warmly with the representative from Almeria in the conference room.

As they exchanged pleasantries, the Almerian delegate spoke rapidly in his native tongue.

Nathaniel turned slightly toward Evelyn, who had been translating throughout the meeting. "What did he say?"

With practiced professionalism, Evelyn relayed, "Mister Nathaniel, Mister Castillo said this has been the most pleasant collaboration he's ever experienced. They hope to continue working with the Grayson Group for the next decade. Their country values partners who are sincere and flexible, unlike the rigid corporations they usually deal with."

Nathaniel arched a brow in surprise. State-owned enterprises from Almeria were notoriously difficult to please, known for their arrogance. This level of enthusiasm was rare.

Clearly, the client was impressed—not just with the deal, but with Evelyn's flawless translation.

After a brief pause, Nathaniel offered a gracious smile. "Tell him we look forward to another ten years of partnership beyond this one."

Evelyn added a touch of wit to his words before conveying them in fluent Almerian.

Mister Castillo laughed heartily, then pulled both Nathaniel and Evelyn into a warm embrace before waving goodbye and exiting with his team.

Pleased with the outcome, Nathaniel studied Evelyn, an unconscious flicker of admiration in his gaze. "Miss Whitmore, see them out for me."

The instruction caught her off guard—but only for a second. A slow smile curved her lips. "Of course, Mister Grayson."

She had officially secured her place at the Grayson Group.

Evelyn escorted the clients to the lobby. By the time she returned, Nathaniel was already gone.

Oliver, his secretary, guided her to a sleek workstation outside the CEO's office. "This is your desk. If Mister Grayson needs you, he'll call. Otherwise, you do not enter his office uninvited. Understood?"

Evelyn nodded. "Crystal clear."

Her success with the Almerian deal had earned her Oliver's begrudging respect—but that didn’t mean he liked her. He hadn’t forgotten how this seemingly innocent woman had once disrespected Nathaniel and crossed Amelia.

After rattling off a few more protocols, Oliver turned to leave.

"Oliver!" Evelyn called after him.

He paused, expression stern. "What now?"

She crooked a finger, signaling him closer. Some things couldn’t be said out loud.

Oliver exhaled sharply but leaned in. "Spit it out."

Evelyn lowered her voice. "Does Nathaniel visit the office often?"

Oliver stiffened. Why is she asking about him? Is she still scheming against Amelia?

"Mister Grayson rarely comes here. Yesterday was an exception. Why do you ask?"
###Chapter 463

A relieved smile spread across Evelyn's lips as she received the perfect answer. "Good. I'll feel much better knowing that man won't be showing up here regularly."

Oliver found Evelyn's behavior rather peculiar. He couldn't quite decipher what was going through her mind. Shaking his head slightly, he turned to leave once more.

"Wait, Mister Oliver," Evelyn called out. "There's one more thing I need to ask of you."

Oliver exhaled sharply in irritation. "If you have requests, state them all at once!"

Evelyn leaned forward slightly. "I don't want the Graysons to discover I'm working here. Could you ensure my employment records remain confidential? No one should be able to trace my presence in this company."

Oliver studied her face for a long moment before nodding. "Consider it done. That's easily arranged."

"Thank you," Evelyn said with genuine gratitude, her tone unexpectedly formal. "I truly appreciate your help."

Her sudden politeness caught Oliver off guard. The usually sharp-tongued woman seemed completely different in professional mode - none of that characteristic arrogance remained.

"Just focus on your work," he said gruffly. "Don't get distracted. Even though you've joined the company, Nathaniel might still find you unsatisfactory and fire you. Familiarize yourself with everything quickly - he'll be returning soon and may assign tasks without warning."

Evelyn gave a firm nod. "Understood. Thank you for the advice, Mister Oliver. I won't let you down."

Oliver blinked. Advice? He hadn't meant it as advice. Huffing, he strode away without another word.

Alone at last, Evelyn sank into her chair with a quiet sigh. At two months pregnant, prolonged standing already strained her back. Motherhood, she was discovering, came with unexpected challenges.

Today marked a significant victory - infiltrating Grayson Enterprises brought her one step closer to uncovering the truth about that night.

But she had another critical mission today: sneak into Nathaniel's office unnoticed and photograph the framed picture on his desk. She needed that image of her mother.

It frustrated her how her mother's face kept slipping from memory. Though she'd studied the photo carefully yesterday, by nightfall the image had blurred again in her mind. Strange how she could recall every other detail with perfect clarity, yet her mother's features remained elusive.

Keeping a copy would help. She needed to memorize that face thoroughly. If her mother was still alive somewhere, Evelyn couldn't risk walking past her on the street without recognition.

Her musings shattered when a shrill, familiar voice cut through the office. "Evelyn Whitmore! What are you doing in the secretary's chair meant for Nathaniel's assistant?"

Evelyn looked up to see someone she hadn't encountered in months - Gabrielle Winslow.

'Wasn't she supposed to be in prison for hiring that hitman? Her sentence couldn't possibly be over yet... When did she get out?'

Gabrielle's lips curled into a triumphant smirk at Evelyn's evident shock. "What's wrong, darling? Didn't expect to see me? Thought I'd still be behind bars?"
###Chapter 464

Evelyn Whitmore leaned back in her office chair, studying Gabrielle Winslow with detached amusement. She didn't bother denying Gabrielle's accusations.

"Correct," Evelyn acknowledged coolly. "You should still be behind bars, Miss Winslow."

Gabrielle had only been released yesterday after her sentence was commuted. Amelia Rivers had begged her brother Samuel to pull strings for her best friend's early release.

The once-luxurious long waves were gone, replaced by a chic shoulder-length bob Gabrielle had hastily styled overnight. The new look suited her, though it couldn't mask the bitterness in her eyes.

"You think I'd rot in prison forever?" Gabrielle's fingers curled into fists. "Amelia would never abandon me after what you did!"

Evelyn merely smiled, unfazed. "Is that so?"

Seeing Evelyn's indifference, Gabrielle's temper flared. "Don't think your schemes fool everyone! Amelia knows the truth - how you framed me, turned Samuel against me! The charges were minor enough for her to get me out. But mark my words, your reckoning is coming."

"I'll look forward to it." Evelyn calmly organized her files, ensuring everything would be at Nathaniel's fingertips when needed.

The hospital incident had indeed been staged - but not by Evelyn. Amelia had orchestrated everything, carefully positioning Gabrielle as the fall girl should things go wrong. Now, playing the compassionate friend to secure Gabrielle's release was just another move in Amelia's game.

Gabrielle mistook cunning for intelligence. Amelia, with her angelic face, was the true master manipulator, weaving narratives that painted her as the perpetual victim while pulling strings unseen.

Eyes narrowing, Gabrielle studied Evelyn's composed movements. "Is this why you're clinging to Samuel? Because Nathaniel discarded you? Too proud to return to being nobody?"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Since when does Samuel belong to you, Gabrielle? News to me." The unspoken truth hung between them - everyone knew Gabrielle's feelings for Samuel.
###Chapter 465

Evelyn had noticed Gabrielle's behavior long before this. The woman had been shamelessly throwing herself at Samuel for months, staking her claim like some territorial animal.

Gabrielle flashed a smug smile. "He's not officially mine yet, but he will be! Amelia personally assured me I'd become part of the Rivers family. Samuel always listens to his sister—so the outcome is inevitable, don't you think?"

"Who's becoming whose sister-in-law?" Samuel's cool, detached voice cut through the air unexpectedly.

Both women startled, turning toward the sound simultaneously.

Samuel appeared freshly returned, his suit jacket draped casually over one arm. Every movement carried effortless grace as he approached, his piercing gaze settling on Gabrielle with visible irritation. "What are you doing here?"

Gabrielle's demeanor transformed instantly—the venom she'd shown Evelyn moments earlier replaced with sickening sweetness. "Samuel darling, I came to thank you for rescuing me yesterday. And I thought you might be hungry, so I prepared your favorite dishes. They're best eaten warm."

Samuel barely glanced at the food container. "Unnecessary. The company provides meals."

"But cafeteria food is dreadful!" Gabrielle pouted, laying a hand on his arm. "This is homemade—healthy and perfectly seasoned. Amelia suggested it herself! She's worried you're working too hard. You wouldn't reject your sister's thoughtful gesture, would you?"

At the mention of Amelia's involvement, Samuel gave a curt nod. "Bring it inside." He strode past her without another glance.

Pausing at his office door, he turned toward Evelyn's desk. "Coffee, Miss Whitmore."

Evelyn rose immediately. "Right away, Mr. Rivers."

The moment Samuel disappeared behind his office door, Gabrielle's mask slipped. She sneered at Evelyn. "Do you even know how he takes his coffee? What level of sweetness he prefers?"

Evelyn answered truthfully. "No. It's my first day—I'm still learning my employer's preferences."

Gabrielle rolled her eyes dramatically. "Useless. Listen carefully—Samuel has an enormous sweet tooth. Ten sugar cubes and two creamers. Don't mess this up."

Evelyn nodded. "Understood. Thank you, Miss Winslow."

Gabrielle stormed off without another word, clutching her food container like a trophy. But as she crossed the threshold into Samuel's office, a vicious smirk twisted her lips—one last triumphant glance thrown Evelyn's way.

The truth was the exact opposite of what she'd claimed. Samuel detested sweetened coffee above all else. Gabrielle could barely contain her excitement—Evelyn was about to make a catastrophic mistake. When that overly sweet coffee arrived, Samuel's temper would flare. With any luck, he'd fire the scheming little secretary on the spot!

After all, if Evelyn could seduce Nathaniel Grayson, who knew what tricks she might try on Samuel? Gabrielle wouldn't take that risk.
###Chapter 466

"Your coffee, Mister Nathaniel." Evelyn knocked lightly before entering, placing the freshly brewed cup on his desk with practiced ease.

Nathaniel barely glanced up from his documents, humming in acknowledgment. His fingers found the cup automatically, bringing it to his lips without breaking concentration from the paperwork before him.

Gabrielle perched elegantly on the office sofa, anticipation gleaming in her eyes. Surely Nathaniel would react violently to the oversweetened coffee. But when he took that first sip... nothing happened.

Her manicured nails dug into the leather cushions. Why wasn't he reacting? Had his tastes changed overnight? Impossible!

Meanwhile, Evelyn lingered near the desk, her gaze subtly drifting toward the framed photograph displayed there.

Nathaniel took another sip before noticing his secretary still hovering. "Why are you still here?" he snapped without looking up. "Get out."

"Of course, Mister Nathaniel." Evelyn's response came smoothly as she turned toward the exit, tray in hand. She paused at the coffee table to place another cup before Gabrielle. "Do enjoy some coffee as well, Miss Winslow."

"Thank you." Gabrielle's smile looked like it might crack her foundation. Through clenched teeth, she whispered, "You didn't sweeten his coffee?"

Evelyn matched her hushed tone. "No, I didn't."

"You little—" Gabrielle barely restrained herself. "I specifically told you how he takes it!"

Evelyn's lips curved knowingly. "Surely you didn't expect me to trust advice from someone who clearly despises me?"

Gabrielle's jaw tightened until her molars ached. This infuriating woman had outmaneuvered her again!

"Curious why I brought two cups?" Evelyn continued conversationally. At Gabrielle's glare, she explained, "One prepared exactly as you suggested, the other plain. Had you been truthful, I could have swapped them before Nathaniel tasted anything amiss." She leaned closer, voice dropping to a honeyed whisper. "But leopards don't change their spots, do they? Enjoy your sugar bomb, Gabrielle."

The cup rattled in Gabrielle's trembling hand as Evelyn straightened with a bright, professional smile. "Do call if you'd like a refill!"

Nathaniel's voice stopped Evelyn at the door. "Wait."

She turned smoothly. "Yes, Mister Nathaniel?"

He shoved a file across the desk. "Translate this for our Almerian clients and email it immediately."

"Right away." Evelyn collected the documents and exited, leaving Gabrielle seething in silent fury.

The anticipated humiliation had backfired spectacularly. Not only had Evelyn escaped unscathed, but Gabrielle now sat clutching a disgustingly sweet coffee, her own trap sprung perfectly against her.
###Chapter 467

Gabrielle felt an immediate sense of relief when she noticed Samuel's cold demeanor toward Evelyn.

At least Samuel had taste—unlike Nathaniel, who somehow found himself drawn to country bumpkins like Evelyn. What on earth did Nathaniel see in someone so unrefined?

Once Evelyn left the office, only Gabrielle and Samuel remained. The perfect opportunity for some quality time together.

But Samuel barely acknowledged her presence.

He was either reviewing documents or typing away on his computer, completely absorbed in his work.

Gabrielle watched him, mesmerized. The way he focused, the sharp lines of his profile—she loved everything about him. She wanted to move closer but didn’t dare interrupt.

By lunchtime, he still hadn’t stopped working.

Concerned, she finally spoke up. "Samuel, aren’t you hungry? It’s lunchtime. You should eat before continuing."

He finally glanced up. "Hmm. Thanks. Leave the food there. I’ll eat later. You can go—Oliver will return the thermos to you."

The dismissal stung, but she wasn’t ready to leave yet. "It’s fine. Amelia said she’d be coming soon, so I’ll wait for her here."

Samuel gave a noncommittal nod. "Suit yourself."

Gabrielle forced a smile and settled back on the couch, her mood deflating. The food she’d brought would go cold soon.

Samuel had always been like this—distant, indifferent.

She’d loved him since they were kids, yet she could never get close.

He treated her with basic courtesy because she was Amelia’s best friend, but nothing more.

Still, she took comfort in the fact that Samuel wasn’t the type to entertain women. As long as she persisted, she believed she could win him over someday.

And with Amelia’s support, her chances were already better than any other woman’s.

Speaking of Amelia—she had texted earlier saying she was on her way, bringing her child along. She should be arriving any minute now.

Gabrielle checked her phone and sent a quick message.

[Where are you, Amelia?]

The reply came swiftly.

[Almost there. Had to bring Joey, so it’s taking a bit longer. Be there soon.]

Meanwhile, outside the office, Evelyn was busy translating documents for the Almerian client when she heard a baby’s cheerful babbling.

At first, she thought she was imagining it—she’d been watching too many parenting videos lately.

Then a soft voice called her name.

"Evelyn."

She looked up to see Amelia pushing a stroller toward her desk. Inside sat a chubby little boy, happily sucking on a pacifier.
###Chapter 468

Was this Amelia and Nathaniel's child?

Evelyn stared at the boy, frozen for a moment before lifting her gaze to meet Amelia's radiant smile.

Amelia beamed at her. "Evelyn, I didn’t get a chance to greet you properly yesterday. I hope you’ve been well."

Evelyn offered a faint smile. "Yes, I have. You look lovely, Miss Amelia."

Amelia lifted the toddler from his stroller, removing the pacifier from his mouth. "Ethan, this is Miss Evelyn."

Ethan, just over a year old and still wobbly on his feet, babbled shyly, "M-Miss E-Evelyn."

Perhaps it was her own pregnancy, but Evelyn couldn’t help finding the little boy utterly endearing. She nodded. "Hello there."

The child, clearly uneasy around strangers, clung to Amelia’s neck and buried his face in her shoulder.

Amelia chuckled, adjusting her hold on him. "Don’t mind him, Evelyn. Ethan’s a bit shy with new people."

Evelyn shrugged it off. "It’s fine. Are you here to see Mister Samuel? He’s in his office."

She lowered her head, returning to her translation work.

But Amelia didn’t move. Instead, she lingered, watching Evelyn type before asking, "Evelyn, tell me—does Ethan look more like me or Nathaniel? I can never decide!"

Evelyn glanced up again, studying the boy. After a moment, she answered, "He favors you more."

Amelia’s smile widened. "Really? Nathaniel says the same! They say boys take after their mothers when they’re young but grow to resemble their fathers. I hope Ethan turns out as handsome as his dad."

Evelyn gave a polite nod. "I’m sure he will."

Amelia tilted her head. "Would you truly wish that for us?"

Evelyn didn’t look up this time, fingers still moving across the keyboard. "What do you think?"

Amelia laughed, the sound light but edged with something sharper. "I think you wouldn’t. You’d be jealous."

Evelyn paused mid-type, then let out a dry chuckle. "You’re overestimating me, Miss Amelia. I’m far too busy to care about the Nathaniel you’re referring to."

Amelia’s smile faltered, her gaze turning icy. "I hope you mean that."

With that, she finally carried Ethan into Samuel’s office.

The door clicked shut. Evelyn stopped typing, pressing a hand to her stomach.

Seeing Amelia’s child had stirred something uncomfortable inside her.

She rubbed slow circles over her belly, murmuring, "It’s okay. Even without your father, I can manage. Just behave, alright? Don’t make this harder than it needs to be."

The discomfort eased. Evelyn exhaled and resumed work.

Her feelings about this child were tangled. And she knew—society would never approve of her raising it alone.
###Chapter 469

Her faith wouldn't permit ending the pregnancy.

Evelyn's life had been marked by hardship since childhood. Passed around like an unwanted object, no one wanted responsibility for her.

After countless upheavals, she finally found refuge in a convent's foster care. Raised by nuns on simple meals, she never took vows but absorbed their teachings deeply.

That night's choice had been hers alone. The child bore no blame.

She wanted this baby.

When Amelia entered the office carrying her son, Gabrielle rushed forward like greeting family.

"Amelia! You made it! That must've been exhausting with the baby."

Amelia's smile softened. "Not at all. I brought the stroller—left it by the door. Were you waiting long?"

Gabrielle gave a strained smile. "Not too long. Gave me extra time with Samuel."

Amelia instantly recognized her brother's neglect. Her gaze swept the untouched lunchbox on the coffee table before landing on Samuel's bent head.

"Samuel," she chided gently, "Gabrielle went through such trouble. The least you could do is eat."

Samuel finally looked up. "Not hungry yet."

Amelia wouldn't relent. "Work can wait. You're having lunch now, or I'll be cross!"

Defeated by his sister's concern, Samuel sighed. "Fine. I'll wash up first."

As he disappeared into the private bathroom, Gabrielle squeezed Amelia's arm. "Thank you. For coming...for trying with Samuel."

Amelia adjusted the baby in her arms. "Don't mention it. You're practically family already."

Gabrielle's eyes shimmered. Amelia always had her back—she'd walk through fire for this friendship.

"Oh!" Gabrielle suddenly remembered. "Did you see? Evelyn's working as Samuel's secretary now!"

Amelia feigned unease. "I noticed. But she's probably just here to work."

"You're too forgiving!" Gabrielle huffed. "After everything she did to you? Don't worry—I'll keep watch."

She tickled the baby's chin before turning serious. "Listen, you and Nathaniel have Joey now. Your wedding's coming. We can't let Evelyn interfere again."
###Chapter 470

Amelia's eyes sparkled with childlike innocence. "No, Gabrielle. You're reading too much into it. Evelyn is actually quite kind."

"Kind? If she were kind, I wouldn't have been framed by her!" Gabrielle exhaled sharply, growing more concerned about her naive best friend. "Amelia, you're a mother now yet still trust everyone blindly! This worries me terribly!"

There was a brief silence before Amelia chuckled at her own delayed reaction. As she opened her mouth to respond, the restroom door swung open.

Both women instinctively fell silent, turning toward Samuel who emerged rolling up his sleeves.

"Amelia, you must be exhausted holding Ethan," Samuel said gently. "Come sit down and rest."

Nodding, Amelia settled onto the couch with Gabrielle, adjusting the toddler in her lap. "Ethan, say hello to your uncle! This is Uncle Samuel!"

The boy blinked owlishly before attempting, "Unca...Sam-el?"

The adults burst into laughter at his adorable mispronunciation.

"It's Uncle Samuel, sweetheart," Amelia corrected patiently.

Ethan scrunched his face in concentration. "Uncle...Sammy?"

Amelia sighed while Samuel reached out to pinch the boy's chubby cheeks affectionately. "He's just a toddler, Amelia. Don't expect perfect diction."

There was something oddly familiar about the adopted child's features that reminded Samuel of his sister, though he felt no particular familial bond - just typical adult fondness for a cute child.

Gabrielle had begun unpacking the elaborate meal she'd prepared, arranging dishes meticulously before offering Samuel utensils. "Try it, Samuel. I hope it suits your taste."

"Thank you," Samuel accepted gracefully, taking a polite bite. "Delicious."

That simple compliment made Gabrielle's cheeks flush. "I could bring you homemade meals every day if you'd like!"

Samuel's expression cooled immediately. "Unnecessary. I prefer working lunches alone. Your visits would disrupt my schedule and waste your time."

The whiplash from praise to rejection left Gabrielle visibly flustered.

"Oh! Well...I don't mind the time, but if it disturbs your work, I won't come uninvited! Just have Amelia message me whenever you want something special!"
###Chapter 471

Nathaniel hummed absently while eating. His responses were polite yet distant, maintaining an air of cool detachment.

Midway through lunch, his phone buzzed. Without hesitation, he stood and excused himself, leaving the office.

Gabrielle frowned as she watched him go. He'd barely touched his food. Was it because she'd cooked it? Had she failed to meet his tastes?

Amelia noticed her friend's unease. She reached out and gave Gabrielle's hand a reassuring squeeze. "Don't take it personally. My brother's always like this—skipping meals, working nonstop. It's not about you."

Gabrielle nodded, though her shoulders remained tense.

Amelia suddenly perked up. "Oh! Aunt Beatrice's birthday party is tomorrow. Do you have a dress ready?"

Gabrielle blinked. She'd completely forgotten. "Amelia, doesn't your aunt still enforce that 'plus-one' rule? I wonder if Nathaniel has already found someone to accompany him this year."

Amelia smirked. "Relax. You've been his partner every year. Why would this one be any different?"

Gabrielle's lips curved into a grateful smile. "You always know just what to say."

Amelia grinned. "But you just got out of prison—you probably haven't had time to shop, right? Let's go pick out something stunning. Knock him dead tomorrow."

Gabrielle hesitated. "What about Ethan?"

Amelia glanced down at the drowsy toddler in her arms, his eyelids drooping.

Just then, Nathaniel's office door swung open. Evelyn was still typing furiously at her desk.

Amelia approached her with a polite smile. "Evelyn, Gabrielle and I need to step out for a bit. Would you mind watching Ethan?"

Evelyn looked up, unimpressed. "Me?" She shook her head. "Babysitting isn't in my job description."

Amelia tried again, softer this time. "We won't be long. Just a quick trip downstairs. I need to grab a few things for him too."

Evelyn didn't even pause her typing. "Miss Rivers, you have two options: take him with you, or ask his uncle—your brother and my boss—to watch him. Either would be better than leaving him with a stranger."

Amelia sighed. "But Ethan's asleep, and Nathaniel isn't here. Besides, he wouldn't know the first thing about childcare."

Evelyn's smile was razor-thin. "I've never had children either. If Mr. Grayson can't handle it, I certainly can't. And I have deadlines. Sorry, but no."

Amelia's shoulders slumped. "Fine." She turned back to Gabrielle, defeated. "Looks like I can't go with you. Maybe ask someone else?"

Gabrielle's eyes flashed. "No. Absolutely not." She glared at Evelyn. "Amelia, she works for your family. Who does she think she is, refusing you?"
###Chapter 472

Amelia's eyes shimmered with vulnerability, tugging at heartstrings. "But—"

Gabrielle slammed her palm on Evelyn's desk. She crossed her arms, chin tilted defiantly.

"Listen up, Evelyn. Ethan's napping on Nathaniel's office couch. Amelia and I are stepping out briefly." Her voice dripped with condescension. "If anything happens to that boy while we're gone, it's on you."

Evelyn didn't bother glancing up, already forming a refusal.

Gabrielle didn't wait for rejection. She grabbed Amelia's wrist. "Let's move."

The elevator doors swallowed them before Evelyn could protest.

Evelyn's brow furrowed. What mother would abandon her child with someone she barely tolerated? Something smelled fishy.

Not her circus, not her monkeys.

Except Nathaniel had stepped out for a call. Leaving a toddler unattended was downright reckless.

With a sigh, Evelyn grabbed her laptop and marched into the office.

Just as described, little Ethan lay curled on the sofa, Amelia's coat draped over him like a blanket.

Evelyn tiptoed past, setting her laptop on the coffee table.

This was her chance. She pulled a miniature camera from her pocket, snapped a photo of the framed picture on Nathaniel's desk—her mother's portrait—and stashed the device away.

Resuming her seat near the sleeping child, she immersed herself in document translation, periodically checking that Ethan hadn't rolled onto the floor.

An hour slipped by. Finished with her work, Evelyn stretched her stiff shoulders.

The boy still slept soundly. She leaned back, closing her tired eyes.

A sudden wail jolted her upright.

Ethan sat up, rubbing his eyes. When his gaze landed on Evelyn, his face crumpled in terror. Sobs erupted like a siren.

Evelyn froze. Pregnancy hadn't come with a manual for calming hysterical toddlers.

"Hey, your mom's coming back soon. Shh."

The one-year-old only wailed louder, incomprehensible babble mixing with tears.

When Evelyn reached toward him, Ethan scrambled backward as if she were Medusa herself.

"Okay, okay! I'll stay right here." She held up her palms in surrender.

Ethan didn't care. He tumbled off the couch and bolted for the door on unsteady legs.

"Wait!" Evelyn lunged after him. A toddler loose in corporate headquarters? That was a lawsuit waiting to happen.
###Chapter 473

The door swung open as Amelia and Gabrielle stepped in, arms laden with shopping bags, their laughter filling the air.

"Amelia, that dress you picked is absolutely stunning! I'm wearing it to Aunt Beatrice's party tomorrow!"

"Mmm, I knew it would suit you perfectly. You'll be the center of attention!"

"Waaah!" The moment Ethan spotted his mother, his cries escalated. He stumbled forward in his haste, tripping over his own feet before collapsing into a fresh wave of tears.

Amelia froze, then rushed to scoop him up. "Ethan, sweetheart, what's wrong?"

Ethan clung to her neck, burying his face against her shoulder, his tiny body shaking with sobs.

"Ethan, talk to Mommy. Are you hurt? Does something hurt?"

But a child his age couldn't articulate his pain—only cry.

Alarmed, Amelia checked him over. When she rolled up his sleeves, her breath caught. His arms were mottled with angry bruises.

Her heart shattered. Tears sprang to her eyes. "H-how did this happen?"

Ethan only cried harder, his whimpers pitiful.

Gabrielle gasped, her expression darkening as she whirled toward the only other person in the room.

"It was you, Evelyn! You hurt him while we were gone!"

"I didn't touch him." Evelyn frowned. Why would a child—Nathaniel and Amelia's beloved son—be covered in bruises? Who would dare harm him?

Gabrielle scoffed. "Oh, please! Who else could it be? You were alone with him!"

Evelyn remained composed. "Accusations require proof, Miss Winslow."

"Proof? The fact that you have no alibi is proof enough!"

Amelia cradled Ethan, her voice trembling with fury. "Evelyn, I trusted you to watch him. No matter how you feel about me, how could you take it out on a child?"

Trust? That was rich.

Evelyn saw right through the act. This was a setup—one so cruel Amelia had used her own son as a pawn.

Just then, Samuel strode in. His smile faded at the sight of his sister and nephew in tears.

"What's going on?"

"Samuel!" Amelia rushed to him, Ethan still clutched in her arms. Her shoulders shook with exaggerated sobs.

Samuel's expression tightened. "Amelia, what happened?"

Gabrielle cut in, venom in her tone. "Evelyn abused Ethan while we were out! Look at him—covered in bruises! She pinched him until he couldn't stop crying!"

She yanked up Ethan's sleeve to reveal the marks.

Samuel's gaze turned icy as it landed on Evelyn. "What kind of monster hurts a child?"
###Chapter 474

Evelyn wasn't the least bit surprised that Samuel would take Gabrielle's side. Without hesitation, she made her position clear.

"Mister Samuel, here's what happened. An hour ago, Miss Amelia and Miss Gabrielle insisted on going shopping and demanded I watch the child. I refused multiple times, but they wouldn't take no for an answer. I had no choice but to stay in the office while Ethan slept. I never laid a finger on him. As for how he got those injuries, I have no idea."

Amelia sobbed harder in Samuel's arms, clutching her son tightly. "Samuel! It's my fault! I never should've left Ethan with your secretary! I didn't think she'd hurt him like this!"

Gabrielle's face twisted in anger. "Samuel, don't listen to her! The moment we walked in, Ethan came running to us, crying and terrified! If we'd been any later, who knows what else she would've done to him? We should call the police right now—child abuse is a serious crime!"

Samuel ignored Gabrielle's outburst. His piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn. "How do you prove you didn't touch him?"

Still cradling Ethan, Amelia turned her tear-streaked face toward Evelyn, voice trembling. "Evelyn... why? Why would you hurt my child?"

Gabrielle sneered. "Is it because Ethan is Amelia and Nathaniel's child? Are you so jealous that you took it out on an innocent boy?"

Jealous? Evelyn scoffed, ignoring Gabrielle entirely. Instead, she fixed Amelia with a sharp look.

"Funny. Most mothers would rush their injured child to a hospital first, then figure out who hurt them. But you? You're more focused on blaming me than treating his wounds."

Amelia's eyes flickered, a flash of guilt crossing her face before she buried it in Samuel's shoulder. "I'm not blaming anyone! I'm devastated seeing Ethan like this! Samuel, please, get a doctor!"

Gabrielle jumped in. "She's just panicking! Of course she cares about Ethan! We all do! We'll take him to the hospital immediately. Stop trying to twist this—just confess and face the consequences!"

Evelyn barely spared Gabrielle a glance before addressing Samuel again. "You asked for proof, didn't you?"

Samuel's expression remained unreadable. "Do you have any?"

"Yes." Evelyn nodded calmly. "I don't know the first thing about childcare, so I started recording the moment I stepped into your office. My phone has been filming nonstop this entire time."

Amelia stiffened. She recorded everything?

Gabrielle's confidence wavered. What if Ethan's injuries weren't her doing?

Samuel narrowed his eyes. "Where's the video?"

Evelyn gestured toward his desk. "My phone's next to the photo frame. You can stop the recording and watch it yourself. The timestamp will match the surveillance footage at your door—no gaps, no edits. It'll prove I never touched Ethan."

Samuel gave Amelia a reassuring pat before handing her off to Gabrielle. He strode to his desk, picked up the phone, and ended the recording.

He fast-forwarded through the hour-long footage, watching every second of Evelyn's time in the office.

Finally, he returned the phone to Evelyn, his voice firm.

"This has nothing to do with you."
###Chapter 475

Samuel's piercing gaze locked onto Amelia. "Amelia, this means Ethan was already hurt before you brought him here. Explain yourself. Who's been around him at home?"

Amelia's stomach twisted with guilt under her brother's interrogation. Her lashes fluttered as fat tears rolled down her cheeks.

She was the one who'd pinched Ethan's tender skin to leave those marks. The whole scheme was meant to frame Evelyn and get her fired from Nathaniel's company. She'd even roped Gabrielle into being her unwitting accomplice.

But that cunning Evelyn had outsmarted her by recording everything!

Amelia masked her panic with dramatic sobs. "Samuel, I don't understand either! Who would harm an innocent child? Maybe the nanny did it when I wasn't looking because Ethan was being difficult?"

Anyone who hurt children deserved the harshest punishment.

Samuel's brow furrowed. "We're calling the authorities. Every staff member who's had contact with Ethan will be investigated thoroughly."

Seeing her brother's determination, Amelia's blood ran cold. She couldn't protest without raising suspicion, so she'd have to devise an escape plan later.

Wiping her tears, she turned to Evelyn while cradling Ethan, forcing an apologetic expression. "Evelyn, please forgive my earlier outburst. I was just so distraught over my baby!"

Evelyn's lips curled. "No need to apologize, Miss Rivers. This isn't your first performance."

Amelia's face drained of color, her rehearsed lines evaporating.

Gabrielle bristled. "How dare you! Amelia's being gracious enough to apologize. Show some respect!"

Evelyn ignored the pawn and addressed Amelia directly. "Since you're so concerned, shouldn't you rush your precious son to the hospital?"

"Y-yes, of course!" Amelia feigned urgency, turning to Samuel. "Gabrielle and I will take Ethan for examination. You're busy with work—no need to come along!"

Samuel did have pressing matters but sent Oliver to assist. Concerned for his sister and nephew, he commanded Evelyn in a no-nonsense tone, "Miss Whitmore, accompany them as my representative. Report any developments immediately."

"Understood, Mr. Rivers." Evelyn bit back her reluctance. Defying her boss on her first day wasn't an option.

She needed this job to continue investigating her mother's past.

Hospitals made Evelyn's skin crawl, especially pediatric wards.

Amelia barred Evelyn from the examination room, leaving her to wait in the hallway. Soon, Amelia sent Gabrielle away too under the pretense of fetching water.
###Chapter 476

At first, Gabrielle considered sending Evelyn to fetch the water.

But suspicion gnawed at her. What if Evelyn tampered with Ethan's drink?

Disgust twisted Gabrielle's features. She snatched her purse and stormed off to buy it herself.

Minutes later, Amelia emerged from the doctor's office, cradling Ethan.

No trace of maternal concern darkened Amelia's flawless face. Instead, a saccharine smile curved her lips as she addressed Evelyn.

"Impressive, Evelyn. I orchestrated today's little drama perfectly, yet you slipped right through my fingers."

The mask had dropped. Evelyn wasn't surprised—just enlightened.

She'd always known Amelia was manipulative. But now she saw the truth: this delicate-looking woman was far more dangerous than she'd imagined.

Using her own speechless toddler's health as a weapon? Amelia had no limits.

Evelyn's lips curled in a cold smirk. "Flattery won't work on me, Amelia. I could never match your cruelty. Doesn't Ethan's father deserve to know?"

Amelia's smile never wavered. "He'll never find out. The doctor confirmed Ethan has allergies—just like you. Those bruises? Allergic reaction to unknown substances. That's the official diagnosis, no matter who asks."

Understanding dawned. Amelia had sent Gabrielle away to bribe the physician.

Evelyn's gaze dropped to the unnaturally docile child in Amelia's arms. Poor boy. What kind of mother did this?

"He's your son. How can you live with yourself?"

Amelia adjusted Ethan's blanket, unfazed. "Save your concern, Evelyn. My family matters don't concern you. You should leave. Nathaniel will be here soon."

Evelyn's chest constricted at Nathaniel's name.

She inhaled sharply, pushing the feeling aside. "Mr. Sinclair assigned me to ensure your safety. I'll leave after confirming Mr. Grayson's arrival."

Amelia's eyes narrowed. "I thought you wanted to avoid Nathaniel. Changed your mind? Planning to throw yourself at him?"

A humorless laugh escaped Evelyn. "Relax. He won't even see me. I just need to report back to Mr. Sinclair."

Skepticism darkened Amelia's gaze. She opened her mouth—

"Amelia!" Gabrielle's voice cut through the tension as she returned with a water bottle. "What did the doctor say?"

Amelia's expression instantly morphed into wide-eyed innocence. "Just allergies, Gabrielle. No abuse."

Gabrielle handed over the water. "Allergies? To what? We need to identify the trigger."

"The nurse will draw blood for testing soon."

"What's the treatment plan?"

"Hospitalization for IV fluids."

Evelyn's stomach turned. That child didn't need intravenous treatment—he wasn't actually allergic. What kind of mother would subject her son to unnecessary medical procedures?
###Chapter 477

Gabrielle seemed more concerned about the child's wellbeing than Amelia, the boy's own mother!

Little Ethan lay quietly in the pediatric ward bed, tears glistening in his eyes. Under Amelia's instruction, he obediently extended his tiny arm for the IV insertion.

He was being remarkably brave. Not a single whimper escaped his lips as the needle pierced his skin.

Evelyn's heart ached watching this. She stepped closer to examine Ethan's medical chart - the one Amelia had bribed the doctor to prepare.

The IV solution contained nothing but basic saline and vitamins, no complex medications.

Still, administering saline to such a young child seemed unnecessary. Could his small body handle it?

As an expectant mother herself, Evelyn couldn't bear seeing Amelia exploit the child this way. She was about to intervene when-

Amelia's phone rang. "Nathaniel! You're here?" Her voice turned sugary sweet. "We're in room 602, sixth floor. Ethan's just getting his IV started."

Hearing Nathaniel had arrived, Evelyn froze mid-step. Any thought of confrontation vanished. With quick thinking, she slipped into the ward's bathroom to hide.

Amelia's eyes gleamed with satisfaction seeing Evelyn retreat. Perfect. The last thing she wanted was Nathaniel spotting Evelyn here.

Gabrielle had been equally worried about another encounter between them. Seeing Evelyn hide like a frightened mouse, she nodded approvingly. At least the girl knew her place.

The steady rhythm of approaching footsteps announced Nathaniel's arrival.

"What happened to the boy?" His deep voice carried concern.

Amelia immediately adopted a fragile tone. "It's nothing serious, Nathaniel. Just a minor allergic reaction. I panicked when I called you earlier. I hope I didn't disrupt your work?"

"No." Nathaniel moved to examine the child now connected to the IV drip.

"Don't worry," Amelia assured him. "The doctor said he'll be perfectly fine."

Nathaniel gave a noncommittal hum before turning abruptly. "Good. I need to use the restroom."

Both women's faces paled at his declaration. Their eyes widened in alarm as panic set in.

Evelyn was still hiding in there!

Nathaniel reached the bathroom door in three long strides. His hand twisted the knob - it didn't budge.

His brow furrowed. "Someone's in there?"

Inside the cramped bathroom, Evelyn's pulse hammered so loudly she feared he might hear it.
###Chapter 478

Amelia knew Nathaniel hadn't told Samuel to stop searching for Evelyn's whereabouts these past few weeks.

That's why she feared what would happen if Nathaniel saw Evelyn now. What if they cleared up the misunderstanding caused by that child right then and there?

She couldn't let that happen. She had finally gotten Evelyn out of Nathaniel's life—she wouldn't stand by and watch them reconcile right in front of her.

Amelia's mind raced. There were things she couldn't say herself, so she discreetly tugged Gabrielle's hand.

Gabrielle startled at the sudden touch. When she turned and saw Amelia's pleading, pitiful expression, sympathy surged through her. An idea struck her.

"It's Samuel," she blurted. "I remember—it's Samuel who just went in. It must be Samuel in the restroom!"

"Samuel?" Nathaniel's hand froze on the door handle. He turned, about to head for the hallway restroom instead.

But before he could step away, the door swung open—and in walked Samuel.

"Amelia, how's Nathaniel doing?"

Amelia and Gabrielle's faces paled.

Damn it. Why now? Their lie was about to unravel.

Nathaniel frowned. He glanced at Samuel, then back at the locked restroom door, suspicion darkening his gaze.

Samuel, oblivious, nodded in greeting. "Nathaniel. Didn't expect to see you here."

Nathaniel ignored him. His cold stare pinned Gabrielle. "Who's really in there?"

Amelia and Gabrielle stiffened, scrambling for an answer.

Samuel took in the tense atmosphere, then the absence of Evelyn. Realization dawned.

"It's Oliver," he said smoothly. "Nathaniel, if you need the restroom, there's one down the hall to the left."

"Oliver?" Nathaniel studied the door for a long moment before the tension in his shoulders eased.

He never would've guessed the woman he'd been searching for relentlessly was hiding just behind that door.

Exhaustion shadowed his deep-set eyes. "Samuel, since you're here, I'll leave them in your care. I have a flight to catch."

Samuel's frown deepened. He didn't like how casually Nathaniel dismissed Amelia and Ethan.

As Nathaniel turned to leave, Amelia rushed forward, catching his sleeve. "Nathaniel."

He paused. "Yes?"

Her doe eyes shimmered with concern. "It's getting colder. Please remember to dress warmly on your trip."

Nathaniel gave a curt nod. "Take care of yourself—and the child."

Amelia smiled sweetly. "Of course. Ethan will be fully recovered by the time you return."

A noncommittal hum was his only reply before he walked out.

Amelia's heart ached watching him go, but she couldn't risk him staying—not with Evelyn still hiding in the bathroom.

A smirk curled her lips as she glanced at the restroom door.

Evelyn must be seething, hearing us exchange such tender words.
###Chapter 479

Evelyn had better remember her place and stay far away from Nathaniel from now on!

As Nathaniel's footsteps faded down the hallway, Samuel turned toward the restroom with icy detachment. "Come out. He's gone."

The door clicked open, revealing Evelyn. She smoothed her skirt nervously. "Thank you, Mister Samuel. I owe you for that timely intervention."

Samuel barely acknowledged her gratitude. His attention shifted to the hospital bed where his nephew lay receiving IV fluids. He pressed a hand against the boy's forehead, checking for fever. Satisfied with the normal temperature, some tension left his shoulders.

Amelia approached. "Samuel, Ethan's fine. Just a minor allergic reaction. There's no need to interrogate the household staff."

"Good." Samuel's nod was curt before his gaze sharpened on his sister. "Amelia, motherhood requires preparation. You can't afford mistakes with a child's wellbeing. Especially since Ethan is—"

Amelia cut him off before he could mention the adoption. "I'm reading parenting books daily, Samuel. I'll improve." She forced a smile. "You shouldn't have left work for this. Go back before your meetings pile up."

Samuel had indeed cleared urgent matters before rushing over. Seeing both sister and child stable, he turned to leave. "Stay with Ethan. I'll send a car later."

"Of course." Amelia nodded.

As Samuel reached the door, Gabrielle's meaningful glance reminded Amelia of their earlier conversation. "Wait! Aunt Beatrice's birthday tomorrow—you've arranged a date, right?"

Samuel's gaze flicked to Gabrielle's hopeful expression before landing on Evelyn lurking nearby. "Already handled."

Gabrielle's face fell.

Amelia blinked. "With whom?"

A beat of silence. Then: "Miss Whitmore."

Evelyn startled at her name. She'd been mentally calculating escape routes, not expecting to be dragged into this. Under Samuel's commanding stare, she swallowed hard. "Yes! That's correct. I'm accompanying Mister Rivers tomorrow."

Gabrielle's glare could have melted steel. "Her?"

Amelia looked equally shocked. "Samuel, you and Evelyn—"

"Enough." Samuel cut her off with a dismissive wave. "Miss Whitmore, with me. Now."

Evelyn followed obediently. "Yes, Mister Rivers."

In the car's front seat, Evelyn sat rigidly proper. From the backseat, Samuel's mocking voice sliced through the silence. "Tell me, Miss Whitmore—does Nathaniel Grayson still terrify you that much?"
###Chapter 480

"I'm not afraid. I simply wanted to avoid complicating things and creating unnecessary tension between your sister and Mister Nathaniel," Evelyn replied, meeting Samuel's sharp gaze in the rearview mirror.

Samuel narrowed his eyes, his expression dripping with arrogance before letting out a derisive scoff. "So you genuinely believe your mere presence could disrupt my sister's relationship with her fiancé? Is that it?"

Evelyn turned her attention to the blur of scenery outside the window and answered honestly, "Yes. To some extent, it would."

A smirk curled Samuel's lips. "Miss Evelyn, where does this unshakable confidence of yours come from? Do you truly think you can compete with Amelia?"

Unfazed by his mocking tone, Evelyn simply smiled. "Mister Samuel, it's natural for you to believe no one compares to your sister—the girl you've doted on her entire life. Just like how, to me, a man as accomplished as you will never be as endearing as the stray cat I rescued years ago. Same logic."

The driver clenched his jaw, fighting back laughter. He'd worked for Samuel for over a decade and had never heard anyone dare speak to him like that.

Samuel fell silent.

His dark eyes lingered on Evelyn's reflection for a long moment before his lips twisted into another smirk. "Enlighten me. What exactly makes you think you measure up to my sister?"

Evelyn's youth contrasted sharply with the steel in her voice. Criticism and mockery didn’t shake her—her confidence wasn’t arrogance, but the quiet certainty of someone who knew her worth.

"Of course, my circumstances aren’t as privileged as Amelia’s. I don’t have a powerful family, a protective older brother, or the refined beauty of someone raised in a gilded cage."

"The fundamental difference between us? Your sister is a delicate orchid nurtured in a greenhouse, while I’m the stubborn weed that clawed its way through concrete. Amelia is fortunate—she’s had you, a towering oak, sheltering her since birth. The Rivers family is her fertile soil."

"But the world I grew up in forced me to become my own shelter. I couldn’t afford to be a vine clinging to someone else’s strength. Vines wither when their host dies. I’ve weathered storms since childhood, and no matter where life plants me, I’ll bloom—because I’ve learned to thrive anywhere."

"So yes, Mister Samuel, Amelia and I are different. But lacking? That’s not a word I’d use for myself."

Samuel studied her through the mirror—this girl who laid out her flaws and strengths with unflinching clarity. For the first time, he saw a brilliance in her that had nothing to do with pedigree or polish. It was the raw, unyielding glow of survival.

Amelia didn’t possess that kind of grit. She didn’t need to. As long as he breathed, his sister would want for nothing.

Samuel leaned back, closing his eyes. "Let’s hope that self-awareness of yours holds true. May you never become a fallen tree."

Evelyn’s smile didn’t waver. "Thank you for the well-wishes, Mister Samuel."
###Chapter 481

Samuel narrowed his eyes with a cold smirk. "You're accompanying me to an event tomorrow. Make sure you're dressed appropriately."

Evelyn blinked in confusion. What event?

Then it hit her—back in the hospital room, Samuel had used her as his supposed partner to deter Amelia and Gabrielle. This must be the birthday party for Amelia's aunt that she'd mentioned earlier.

She'd only been playing along as his employee then. She never actually expected him to follow through!

Evelyn hesitated. High-society parties weren't her scene. But then she considered—Samuel's aunt was a senior Rivera family member. She might know details about past family affairs. Perhaps even information about her mother.

After a moment's thought, she turned to him. "Mr. Rivers, will Nathaniel be attending tomorrow?"

Samuel studied her with sudden interest. After a deliberate pause, he answered, "No. The Graysons never attend Rivera functions."

Of course. The longstanding feud between the families meant they avoided each other's events.

Plus, Nathaniel had mentioned catching a flight at the hospital. He was likely away on business.

Satisfied with the answer, Evelyn gave a professional smile. "Understood. I'll prepare suitable attire for tomorrow's event."

Samuel closed his eyes without responding.

Rivera Group's official hours ended at 5 PM, but Evelyn didn't leave until six.

Exiting the corporate building, she walked several blocks before casually turning into a quiet alleyway.

A black MPV waited there. Evelyn approached it directly, opened the door, and slid inside.

Seraphina was typing rapidly on her laptop in the backseat. At Evelyn's arrival, her stern expression softened into warmth. "Finally finished work, boss?"

Exhausted, Evelyn leaned back, resting her head against Seraphina's shoulder.

Sebastian glanced at his watch from the front passenger seat before turning around. "Six o'clock? That's brutal. Rivera Group works you like a dog."

Evelyn sighed against Seraphina's shoulder. "Regular staff leave at five. But Samuel stayed late, and as his secretary..."

Seraphina massaged Evelyn's shoulder sympathetically. "I hate seeing you exhaust yourself like this. You insisted on infiltrating Rivera Group, but—"

"It's temporary," Evelyn interrupted with a yawn. "If I couldn't handle this much, I wouldn't have survived my childhood."

Seraphina frowned. "You're pregnant now. You shouldn't push yourself so hard."

Evelyn absently touched her stomach. "My baby's tough like me. Oh—Seraphina, I'll need to borrow a formal dress tomorrow."
###Chapter 482

Evelyn never purchased clothes that restricted her movement. Her closet was devoid of formal gowns or anything similarly impractical.

While she had founded Newmoon Group single-handedly, Seraphina and Sebastian typically handled the social engagements. As the shadow CEO, Evelyn focused solely on technical operations, major decisions, and company development.

Seraphina knew her boss despised restrictive clothing. Closing her laptop, she arched an eyebrow. "What's with the sudden interest in formal wear?"

Evelyn stretched lazily. "Nathaniel wants me at some fancy event tomorrow. Black-tie required."

Seraphina smirked. "We'll hit the designer boutiques after dinner. My dresses would swallow you whole - especially up top." She gestured to her chest.

Evelyn reached over and gave an experimental squeeze. "True. You're definitely a cup size bigger."

Without missing a beat, Seraphina returned the favor. "Don't worry, boss. Pregnancy hormones will fix that soon enough."

Evelyn shook her head vehemently. "No thanks! I'm perfectly content with my B-cups. Bigger looks great on others but feels like carrying sandbags."

"Fair point," Seraphina conceded. "Your proportions are already ideal - the perfect balance."

From the front seat, Sebastian groaned. "Hello? Remember there's a man present? This is getting awkward."

The women exchanged glances. They'd long stopped viewing Sebastian as anything but one of the girls. Their friendship transcended typical boundaries.

Ignoring him completely, Seraphina changed topics. "Dinner plans?"

Evelyn's eyes lit up. "That barbecue place we love. Haven't had it since leaving the capital."

Seraphina frowned. "You're eating for two now. Shouldn't we choose something healthier?"

Sebastian immediately took Evelyn's side. "One meal won't hurt! She's been nauseous for weeks - let her enjoy a craving for once."

After brief consideration, Seraphina relented. Sebastian started the engine, and soon the familiar shack came into view.

The moment the savory aroma hit, Evelyn practically vibrated with excitement. Just as she reached for the door handle, Seraphina grabbed her wrist. "Wait."

Sebastian rolled his eyes. "Not this again. Live a little!"

Seraphina adjusted her glasses, her expression turning serious. "Not about the food. Look over there - isn't that Nathaniel Grayson?"

Evelyn's playful demeanor vanished. Following Seraphina's gaze, she spotted Nathaniel sitting alone at a corner table.

A single beer, plate of skewers, and bowl of chips sat untouched before him. Despite the casual setting, Nathaniel maintained his usual regal posture, face impassive.

The shop owner approached with a soda, laughing as he made some comment. Nathaniel offered only the slightest nod in response, his expression never wavering.
###Chapter 483

From their vantage point, Evelyn Whitmore, Seraphina Montgomery, and Sebastian Monroe couldn't hear the conversation between the stall owner and the man. Yet one thing was certain - seeing someone as distinguished as Nathaniel Grayson sitting at a roadside food stall created a jarring contrast.

Sebastian let out a low whistle. "Boss, I never imagined Nathaniel would frequent places like this common folk do. Barbecue, beer, and chips at a street stall? But why's he alone? Drinking solo isn't any fun."

Evelyn found the scene equally puzzling. Hadn't Nathaniel mentioned catching a flight when they met at the hospital earlier? Why was he still in New Capital City?

Her mind flashed back to when she'd dined alone at this very stall, and Nathaniel had spotted her while passing by. He'd joined her, sampling the barbecue despite his usual refined tastes. She remembered being so full afterward that she couldn't stand, and how he'd taken her hand to help her up.

The memory made her cheeks burn with embarrassment.

"Who knows? Maybe he's expecting company." Evelyn's appetite vanished. "Let's go somewhere else. Somewhere simpler."

Sebastian raised an eyebrow. "Expecting company? You think he's waiting for you, boss?"

Evelyn shot him a glare. "In your dreams! Just drive."

Exchanging glances, Sebastian and Seraphina complied, pulling away from the stall.

Nathaniel sat at the mismatched stall, drawing constant attention from passersby. People whispered theories about his identity, but none dared meet his piercing gaze directly, stealing only furtive glances.

After several minutes, Nathaniel rose without touching his food. He strode away with commanding presence, indifferent to the mix of admiration and confusion following him.

Lucas Sinclair opened the car door, waiting until Nathaniel was seated before exhaling quietly.

For the past month, Nathaniel had visited this stall periodically. He'd order food but never eat, simply sitting in silent contemplation.

While others might not understand, Lucas knew. Evelyn - now missing - had loved this stall's food. Before her disappearance, Nathaniel would sometimes send Lucas to fetch takeout from here, despite his usual distaste for street food. He'd compromised because she enjoyed it.

Lucas used to believe Amelia Rivers was the most important woman in Nathaniel's life, given how readily he accommodated her requests.

Then Evelyn appeared, and Lucas witnessed what true love looked like.

Nathaniel's care for Amelia stemmed from gratitude for saving his life. But with Evelyn, his tenderness came freely - pure, unconditional devotion.

Sliding into the passenger seat, Lucas turned to report. "Sir, we still have no leads on Miss Evelyn's whereabouts."

"People don't vanish. Keep searching." Nathaniel's calm voice carried steel beneath its surface.

"Yes, sir." Lucas signaled the driver.

The luxury Mercedes-Benz MPV glided away, moving in the opposite direction of the car that had paused briefly by the roadside earlier.
###Chapter 484

The Rivera Group offices were nearly empty when Evelyn finished work that evening.

She slipped into the restroom to change into the evening gown Samuel had requested she wear.

Last night after dinner, Seraphina had taken Evelyn to an exclusive atelier. Together they'd selected a stunning ash purple chiffon dress with delicate off-the-shoulder detailing.

The design was ethereal yet practical - the hem fell just above her ankles, allowing freedom of movement. Exactly Evelyn's preference.

Changed and ready, Evelyn returned to her desk to wait.

Twenty minutes later, Samuel emerged from his office.

Evelyn stood immediately, professional as always. "Mr. Rivers."

Samuel's gaze lingered when he saw her. The sight of her in that dress struck him unexpectedly.

Something warm flickered behind his usually impassive expression. An unfamiliar tenderness stirred in his chest.

His prolonged stare made Evelyn shift uncomfortably. "Mr. Rivers?"

Samuel blinked, collecting himself. "Excellent choice."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Are you complimenting the dress or my taste?"

"Both." Samuel didn't hesitate. "Gather your things. We're leaving."

Her bag was already packed. Evelyn followed him to the elevator in silence.

Oliver waited with the car at the curb. His eyes widened when he saw Evelyn.

He'd always known she was beautiful, but this transformation was breathtaking. She moved with effortless grace that put Amelia to shame.

Only one phrase came to mind - an angel walking among mortals.

Samuel cleared his throat pointedly.

Oliver jumped to open the door.

With the front seats occupied, Evelyn slid into the back beside Samuel.

Normally she'd relax during car rides, but the formal dress kept her posture perfect.

Samuel glanced at her rigid form from the corner of his eye as he scrolled through his phone.

"Planning to hunt for new prospects tonight, Miss Whitmore?" His tone was deceptively light.

Evelyn's lips thinned. "If you hadn't insisted on formalwear, I'd be far more comfortable in my usual clothes. As for your implications - think what you want. My conscience is clear."

Samuel pocketed his phone, oddly charmed by her sharp retort.

Yet the dress troubled him. The off-shoulder cut revealed too much. At such a prestigious event, he worried his less refined relatives might bother her.

The thought unsettled him more than he cared to admit.
###Chapter 485

Samuel couldn't quite explain what was happening to him. He found himself worrying about Evelyn, the woman he'd always disliked.

He pinched the bridge of his nose, convincing himself it was just exhaustion from work playing tricks on his mind.

The car soon arrived at Silver Moon Estate. After parking, Evelyn followed Samuel out and stepped into the grand manor.

A few steps in, Samuel suddenly halted. He glanced at Evelyn from the corner of his eye, his tone indifferent. "Are you cold?"

It was early winter, and the night air had turned sharp.

Evelyn's bare arms were flushed from the chill, but she shrugged. "I'm fine."

Samuel studied her for a moment before turning away. "Oliver, bring the jacket Amelia bought me last week. Let Miss Whitmore wear it."

Oliver blinked in surprise but obeyed without question.

Evelyn stiffened slightly as the jacket settled over her shoulders. "Thank you for your concern, Mister Rivers."

Samuel's reply was icy. "Don't read into it. I just don’t want you getting sick and spreading it at work tomorrow."

A faint smile touched Evelyn’s lips. "I wasn’t. But regardless of your reasons, I should still thank you for the gesture."

Samuel gave her a dismissive glance and strode ahead, leaving Evelyn to follow in silence.

Silver Moon Estate was the Rivers family’s domain, and their presence alone granted them entry. However, guests were only permitted into the banquet hall after signing in with their partners at the reception. Solo attendees, no matter their status, were turned away—a long-standing rule for Beatrice Sterling’s birthday celebrations.

As her nephew, Samuel couldn’t skip the event without causing offense. Every year, he brought a partner purely for formality’s sake.

His arrival stirred whispers in the hall.

Samuel rarely attended social gatherings, making his appearance tonight a rarity. Only someone of Beatrice’s standing could draw him out.

"Look, Mister Rivers is here with his date!"

"Who is she? I’ve never seen her before."

"She’s stunning. And she’s wearing his jacket—there must be something between them."

"Not surprising. He’s at that age. Bringing his girlfriend to his aunt’s party makes sense."

"I remember Gabrielle Winslow used to be his plus-one every year."

"That was only because she’s close to Amelia. Now that he has someone else, of course he’s moved on."

"Exactly. He was never interested in Gabrielle anyway."

Ignoring the chatter, Samuel scanned the room before speaking flatly to Evelyn. "Find a seat. I need to greet my family."

"Of course, Mister Rivers," Evelyn replied politely. She assumed he didn’t want unnecessary rumors by introducing her to his relatives.

After a few steps, Samuel paused and glanced back at her.

What exactly was bothering him?
###Chapter 486

Samuel couldn't quite explain the unease coiling in his chest, but every instinct screamed that leaving Evelyn alone wasn't wise.

He turned abruptly. "Do you have my number saved?"

Evelyn nodded, fingers brushing against her phone. "It's already in my contacts."

"Good. Call me immediately if anything happens before I get back."

"Understood, Mister Samuel."

Only when his broad shoulders vanished into the champagne-clinking crowd did Evelyn exhale.

From the grand staircase, Amelia and Gabrielle watched the exchange with matching frowns. Amelia's manicured nails dug into her clutch. "That's the limited-edition Burberry trench I gave Samuel last week!"

She'd originally purchased it for Nathaniel, but when he rejected the gift, she'd passed it to her brother instead. Seeing it draped over Evelyn's shoulders now made her blood boil.

Gabrielle drained her wineglass in one furious gulp. "Your brother hated her last week. Now he's playing knight in shining armor? That witch works fast."

For years, Gabrielle had been Samuel's default plus-one to Beatrice's events. Not once had he offered her his jacket. The injustice burned.

Evelyn was sampling chocolate ganache when Gabrielle stormed over. "You disgusting little gold-digger!"

A dab of frosting clung to Evelyn's Cupid's bow as she turned. "Gabrielle? Who pissed in your champagne?"

The innocent smear of chocolate only accentuated Evelyn's ethereal beauty, fueling Gabrielle's rage. "First Nathaniel, now Samuel? Can't you survive without stealing other women's men?"

Evelyn's laugh tinkled like broken crystal. "Projecting much? I'm not the one having a public meltdown over being someone's second choice."

Gabrielle's hand shot toward the dessert tower. Amelia intercepted just as her friend grabbed a triple-layer cake. "Don't! You're drunk!"

The warning came too late. Gabrielle, fueled by humiliation and Merlot, hurled the dessert with deadly accuracy.
###Chapter 487

"Gabrielle, Evelyn is only working with Samuel. Don't read too much into it! You're drunk. Come on, let's get some air."

Gabrielle's face twisted with frustration, unwilling to let Evelyn walk away so easily. Thankfully, Amelia managed to talk her down, and the tension slowly eased. With one last venomous glare at Evelyn, Gabrielle followed Amelia out to the balcony.

The night air was crisp, sharp against Gabrielle's flushed skin. The alcohol haze lifted slightly, but the bitterness remained. "Amelia, you shouldn't have stopped me. I should've taught that woman a lesson!"

Amelia sighed, her expression gentle but firm. "Gabrielle, think. This is my aunt Beatrice's birthday party. Do you really want to make a scene?"

The realization hit Gabrielle like ice water. She shuddered. Beatrice Sterling wasn't just any host—she was a force of nature, ruthless to anyone who dared disrupt her events.

If Gabrielle had caused trouble tonight, Beatrice would've thrown her out without hesitation—and any hope of winning Nathaniel's favor would've vanished forever.

"You're right," Gabrielle muttered, gripping the railing. "I almost ruined everything."

Amelia gave a small, knowing smile.

Truthfully, she hadn't intervened out of kindness. She would've loved to see Gabrielle tear into Evelyn. But not here, not now—not when Amelia would be dragged into the fallout.

A voice cut through the quiet. "Well, well. Amelia Rivers. It's been too long."

Amelia turned to see a man in a gaudy checkered suit swaggering toward them, wineglass in hand. His smirk was all too familiar.

"Julian," she said flatly.

Julian Blackwood—her cousin, and a man with a reputation as filthy as his grin. A few years in prison hadn't changed that.

His gaze slid past Amelia, locking onto Gabrielle with predatory interest. "And this must be the famous Gabrielle Winslow. My, how you've grown."

Gabrielle recoiled, disgust twisting her features. If he weren't Amelia's family, she'd have slapped him already.

Amelia saw the hunger in Julian's eyes—and an idea sparked. She gestured subtly toward the banquet hall. "See that girl over there? Single. And exactly your type."

Julian's attention shifted. His eyes landed on Evelyn, pure and radiant amidst the crowd.

His grin widened. "Now that is a masterpiece."
###Chapter 488

"Who is she? What a stunning beauty!" Julian licked his lips as his gaze locked onto Evelyn.

Gabrielle noticed Amelia's smirk and Julian's obvious arousal. She immediately chimed in, "Julian, not only is she breathtaking, but rumor has it she's quite... adventurous with men. Why don't you go introduce yourself? I'm sure you'd get along famously."

Julian's interest peaked. "Adventurous? How so?"

Gabrielle gave a knowing smile. "Let's just say she knows all the games wealthy gentlemen enjoy playing."

Julian adjusted his tie, practically salivating. "Now that's my kind of woman! Amelia, I'll leave you two ladies to chat. I have some... networking to do."

As Julian strutted toward Evelyn, Amelia feigned concern. "Gabrielle, should we really be sending Julian after her like this?"

Gabrielle scoffed. "Why not? That country bumpkin's been throwing herself at Nathaniel and Samuel. A nobody like her should be grateful for attention from someone like Julian! Besides, if they hit it off, she'll stop sniffing around our men."

Amelia pretended to consider this before nodding sweetly. "I suppose you're right. It would be lovely to have her as family. We could all spend time together!"

Gabrielle rolled her eyes at her friend's naivety. The thought of socializing with that gold-digger made her skin crawl.

"Exactly. Marrying into the Blackwoods would be the best thing that ever happened to her."

Their conspiracy complete, both women turned to watch as Julian made his move.

Evelyn had indulged in too many desserts and reached for an orange-colored drink. After verifying it was non-alcoholic, she took a sip of the refreshing fruit blend.

Leaning against the buffet table, she surveyed Silver Moon Estate's lavish decor with mixed emotions.

She'd visited several times before, always experiencing an odd sense of déjà vu. Only now did she understand why - this had once been her childhood home as Vivian Sterling.

What family secrets had driven her mother to flee with her? Why had her mother entrusted her to a long-estranged friend before vanishing? The unanswered questions darkened her mood.

"Drinking alone, beautiful?"

Evelyn turned to see a man in an obnoxious plaid suit eyeing her like a piece of meat.

"It's juice," she replied coldly.

Julian selected an elaborate pastry. "You must try these chestnut cakes. My aunt spares no expense for her parties."

"No thank you." Evelyn's polite refusal carried steel. But his earlier comment intrigued her. "Your aunt hosts this? So you're a Rivers?"

Julian puffed his chest. "Blackwood actually, but yes - we're practically family!"
###Chapter 489

He was Amelia Rivers' cousin. No matter how you looked at it, he could still claim some connection to the Rivers family.

The Rivers name carried weight—power, influence, prestige. Even if he wasn’t truly one of them, he’d milk that association for all it was worth.

Evelyn studied Julian Blackwood. He wasn’t the sharpest tool in the shed, and his ties to the Rivers made him an ideal target. If she played her cards right, she might pry some useful information about the family’s past from him.

Someone as shrewd as Samuel Rivers? No chance. He’d see right through her.

With that in mind, Evelyn flashed Julian a warm smile. "Hello. It’s nice to meet you."

Julian’s eyes lit up, instantly charmed. "The pleasure’s all mine, gorgeous. What’s your name?"

"Evelyn Whitmore."

"Miss Evelyn," he purred. "Call me Julian." He glanced at the jacket draped over her shoulders. "That your boyfriend’s?"

If she was taken, he’d back off—unless the guy was a nobody.

Evelyn shook her head. "No, just my boss. He’s a gentleman—lent it to me when I got cold."

Julian smirked, satisfied. "Ah, I see. My date ditched me for some other guy on the dance floor. Looks like we’re both being used, huh?"

Evelyn chuckled. "Seems that way."

"Is this your first time at Silver Moon Estate? If you’re free, I could show you around."

"Really? I heard guests aren’t allowed to wander beyond the banquet hall."

The fact that she was considering it sent a thrill through Julian.

Evelyn wasn’t blind to his intentions—but she misread them. She assumed he was just another rich playboy looking for a flirty distraction.

What she didn’t realize was the darker hunger lurking beneath his charm.

And she did want to explore the estate. Maybe it would jog some long-buried memories.

But sneaking around alone was too risky. If she got caught, Nathaniel would have questions—questions she couldn’t answer without blowing her cover.

However… if a Rivers escorted her? That changed everything.

Julian puffed out his chest. "Of course I can. This whole place belongs to my family. I go where I want."

Evelyn nodded. "Then lead the way."

Julian’s grin turned wolfish. She was eager. Just like Gabrielle had said—this one knew how to have fun.

Pure on the outside, wild behind closed doors. His favorite kind.

He guided her toward the second floor, pulse racing. Plenty of empty rooms up there.

And very, very large beds.
###Chapter 490

Evelyn followed Julian down the dimly lit corridor on the second floor of Silver Moon Estate. He was leading her toward what he promised would be a more spacious room.

She froze mid-step when her eyes caught a particular painting hanging along the hallway. The brushstrokes bore an uncanny resemblance to her mother's distinctive style.

Noticing her hesitation, Julian turned with a puzzled frown. "Something wrong, Miss Evelyn? Why'd you stop?"

Her gaze remained fixed on the artwork. "Mr. Julian, as a Blackwood, you must know all the family secrets, don't you?"

He flashed a smug grin, eager to impress the woman who'd caught his attention. "Naturally! The Blackwoods have no secrets from me."

Perfect. His vanity would be her advantage. "I heard Mr. William's current wife isn't his first marriage. Is that true?"

Julian's eyes lit up at a question he could actually answer. "Spot on! His first wife vanished years ago. The current Mrs. Rivers gave him two perfect children - his pride and joy!"

"I see." Evelyn pressed further, "Did his first wife... pass away?"

A crude chuckle escaped him. "Ran off with some man, they say. Probably dead by now after all these years. Can you believe it? A woman abandoning a man like William Rivers!"

Seizing the moment, Evelyn narrowed her eyes. "Who was this man she supposedly ran away with?"

Julian's confidence faltered. Not wanting to spread unverified rumors about the powerful Rivers family, he abruptly changed tactics. Leaning closer with a leer, he purred, "Enough boring family history, darling. Let's go inside and discuss... more entertaining topics."

Evelyn stood her ground. "One last question."

His patience wearing thin, Julian snapped, "What now?"

"Did the Rivers family have another daughter? Celeste?"

"Yeah, William had an older daughter. Celeste." Julian sneered. "Bastard child, from what I heard. Proof of his first wife's infidelity. Poor man raised another man's kid for years!"

Evelyn's hands clenched. She'd never believe such slander about her mother. "Was there any actual evidence?"

"Enough questions!" Julian grabbed her arm roughly. "Time for you and me to get better acquainted!"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Acquainted how?"

He licked his lips. "What do you think happens when a man and woman are alone? Now be a good girl and take off those clothes. I'll show you exactly what we'll be doing."

Her lip curled in disgust. "Why would I do that?"

"Stop playing hard to get!" Julian snarled. "I know all about your reputation. Now strip and service me properly. Do it well, and I might even pay you!"

Someone had fed him lies about her? Evelyn took a deliberate step back, mind racing. "If we're going to do this... may I freshen up first?"
###Chapter 491

Julian's fingers trembled with anticipation as he tore off his shirt. The belt slid from his trousers with a metallic clink.

"Don't waste time, darling," he purred, raking his gaze over Evelyn's frame. "That porcelain skin of yours is perfect as it is. And that scent—like roses dipped in honey. Skip the bath. Just strip and get on that bed."

Evelyn batted her lashes, dipping her chin with faux shyness. "Alright... but close your eyes first. I can't undress with you watching. It's embarrassing."

Julian's grin widened. She was playing along—exactly what he wanted.

"Such a tease, my sweet little vixen. Fine, I'll humor you." He squeezed his eyes shut dramatically. "No peeking. Scout's honor."

The moment his lids sealed, Evelyn's demure mask shattered. Her phone slid from her pocket, camera app already open. The red recording light blinked as she angled it at Julian's face.

Her voice dripped saccharine venom. "Tell me, Julian... who claimed I'd be such... entertaining company?"

Julian's tongue darted over his lips. "Why question a gift? Just get naked. I'm dying to see what's under that dress."

Evelyn fake-pouted. "Naughty boys don't get rewards. Who talked?"

A wet chuckle. "Gabrielle, obviously. Said you're a wildcat in silk sheets. Now stop stalling—"

Gabrielle. Of course.

Evelyn's giggle was all honeyed malice. "And you believed her? What if she lied?"

"Don't care." Julian's voice turned guttural. "You're mine tonight."

"What if I refuse?"

His laugh was a predator's growl. "Then I'll take what I want. Rough or gentle—your choice."

Evelyn's smile turned arctic. "Open your eyes, Julian."

When he did, his face twisted in rage. She stood fully clothed, phone raised like a weapon.

"You bitch! You—"

The video playback cut him off. Julian's own voice boomed: "I'll take what I want. Rough or gentle—your choice."

Evelyn pocketed the phone. "Funny thing about those 'games' Gabrielle mentioned. I don't play them." She tilted her head. "But courts do. And this footage? Textbook attempted rape."

Julian lunged—just as a shrill voice pierced the door.

"Samuel! Your secretary Evelyn went in there with some man! Should we... intervene?"

Gabrielle.

Evelyn's lips curled. Setting me up? How original.

The knob rattled violently. Then a voice like cracking ice:

"Open. This. Door."

Samuel.
###Chapter 492

Julian's hands trembled violently when Samuel's voice cut through the door. He scrambled to gather his scattered clothes from the floor, dressing with frantic haste.

"Samuel! It's Julian! I had too much wine downstairs and needed to lie down. I'm alone here! What do you need?"

'Damn it!' His mind raced. 'Why is Samuel here of all people?'

Julian distinctly remembered Gabrielle mentioning the woman in his room was Samuel's secretary. She'd said the woman came with her boss.

"This is catastrophic!"

If he'd known this would happen, he'd never have dared touch Samuel's people.

"Open this door now!" Samuel's voice held no room for negotiation.

Julian had no choice. Defying Samuel wasn't an option. He finished buttoning his shirt and opened the door with a nervous grin. "Samuel! What brings you here?"

Samuel's icy glare made Julian shrink back. The man strode past him, scanning the empty room with sharp eyes.

Julian blinked in confusion.

'Hadn't the girl been here moments ago? Where'd she vanish? Well... better this way. At least Samuel won't catch me red-handed.'

"Who are you looking for, Samuel? Like I said, I'm resting alone."

Gabrielle pushed past them, searching every corner. Her brows furrowed. "That's impossible! I saw Evelyn enter with Julian!"

Julian shot Gabrielle a venomous look, cursing her interference.

Then - the distinct sound of running water from the bathroom. Gabrielle pointed triumphantly. "She's in there!"

Samuel's gaze darkened as he turned to Julian. "Who's in the bathroom?"

"N-no one!" Julian's voice cracked.

Gabrielle feigned shock. "It must be Evelyn! She's probably... cleaning up after their... encounter."

Realizing Gabrielle had set him up, Julian's rage erupted. "What filthy lies! If I had a woman here, we wouldn't be done yet! I last much longer than that!"

Gabrielle recoiled at his vulgarity, thinking him perfectly matched with that secretary.

Samuel marched to the bathroom door and pounded. "Whoever's in there - come out now!"

Only the water's steady flow answered. No movement. No reply.

"Samuel? Gabrielle? What's happening?" Amelia appeared at the doorway, deliberately accompanied by curious relatives pretending to pass by.

Gabrielle seized the opportunity. "Samuel's looking for his secretary Evelyn, but she's apparently... occupied with Julian here."

Amelia's cheeks flushed. "That can't be! They only just met tonight at the banquet!"
###Chapter 493

Amelia pressed her lips together and exhaled sharply. "Some people rush into relationships so fast—sleeping together on the first meeting. We're practically saints compared to them, Evelyn. I can't fathom how any woman could be so... careless."

The girls Amelia had brought with her immediately pulled out their phones, texting their friends to come witness the drama. Exactly the reaction Amelia had hoped for.

She wanted everyone to see with their own eyes that Evelyn was the kind of woman who would jump into bed with a stranger. That way, Nathaniel would never look at her the same way again.

Despite the venom in her thoughts, Amelia wore an expression of gentle concern. "Even if things moved too quickly between Evelyn and Julian, they're both single. They can do whatever they want. It's not our place to judge."

Freedom? Is that her excuse for locking herself in a bathroom with a man she just met? A sudden, inexplicable fury burned in Samuel's chest, one he couldn't quite suppress.

Over the past few days, he'd started to see Evelyn differently—competent, hardworking, nothing like the reckless girl he'd assumed her to be.

Now, that fragile respect shattered into disgust.

How could a woman who carries herself with such dignity be so shameless? Is this how she was raised?

Samuel clenched his jaw, his voice dangerously calm. "Open the door, Amelia. Tell her to come out."

Amelia hesitated, playing the reluctant mediator before finally stepping toward the bathroom. Of course, she wanted this more than anyone—to watch Evelyn's reputation crumble in front of everyone.

She knocked lightly, feigning politeness. "Evelyn? If you don't come out, I'll have to open the door."

Silence.

With a theatrical sigh, Amelia turned the knob and stepped inside. "Evelyn?"

The bathroom was empty. Only the sound of running water from the half-filled tub echoed in the space.

Where is she?

Gabrielle followed Amelia inside, eyes widening in shock. They searched every corner, but Evelyn was nowhere to be found.

A crowd had already gathered at the door, whispering excitedly, eager to catch a glimpse of the scandalous woman who couldn’t wait to sneak off with a man.

When Amelia informed Samuel that Evelyn wasn’t there, he strode into the bathroom himself, scanning the space before turning to Julian with a glare. "Where is she?"

Julian was just as confused. He had no idea how Evelyn had vanished. But he was quick to play dumb. "Who? I don’t know any Evelyn. You’ve got the wrong room."

Samuel's eyes darkened. "Last chance. Where. Is. Evelyn?"

Julian swallowed hard. "I—I don’t—"

"Mister Samuel! Were you looking for me?"

Evelyn’s voice cut through the murmurs of the crowd, clear and composed.

Everyone turned.

There she stood—completely dry, perfectly poised, as if she hadn’t just been the center of a scandal.
###Chapter 494

Nathaniel froze mid-step, pivoting sharply toward the voice. Evelyn emerged from the sea of spectators, weaving through the crowd with effortless grace.

She stopped beside him, tilting her head. "Do you need something, Mr. Grayson?"

Amelia, Gabrielle, and Sophia stood shell-shocked. Their expressions mirrored pure disbelief at Evelyn's sudden appearance outside the room.

Nathaniel's gaze burned into her. "Where were you?"

Evelyn blinked innocently. "Nowhere special. I waited downstairs for your return. When I noticed everyone rushing upstairs, I followed to investigate." She paused, lips curving. "Imagine my surprise when I heard you calling my name. Why would you look for me here, of all places?"

Nathaniel's jaw clenched. How could he admit he'd suspected her of sneaking around with another man?

Gabrielle's nails dug into her palms as she stepped forward. "Stop playing dumb! I saw you enter this room with Julian! You must've slipped out during the commotion!"

Evelyn's brow furrowed in genuine confusion. "Julian who?"

Gabrielle's face flushed crimson. "Still pretending?"

Evelyn sighed, turning wounded eyes toward Nathaniel. "Mr. Grayson, perhaps you shouldn't bring your secretary to social events anymore. It seems I've become a target for jealous admirers." Her gaze flicked to Gabrielle. "Though I must say, Miss Winslow, your obsession is becoming... concerning."

Gabrielle spluttered. "That's not—Nathaniel, don't listen to her! She was definitely here with Julian!"

Nathaniel shot Gabrielle a withering look. Her constant meddling had caused enough problems over the years. This entire fiasco likely stemmed from her petty jealousy.

Evelyn scanned the crowd. "Would the real Mr. Blackwood please stand up?"

Julian staggered to his feet, disoriented. "Uh... that's me."

Evelyn offered a polite smile. "Hello. Have we met?"

Julian's mind raced. Admitting he'd nearly assaulted Nathaniel's secretary would be suicide. "Never seen you before in my life."

"Exactly." Evelyn turned back to Gabrielle. "Satisfied?"

Julian seized the opportunity, puffing out his chest. "Nathaniel, I just had too much to drink! Came up here to freshen up, and suddenly people are barging in—"

Nathaniel's expression turned glacial. "Get dressed. Leave."

Julian forced a laugh. "Cousin, is that any way to—"

"Walk out now," Nathaniel's voice dropped dangerously, "or I'll have security remove you."

Julian scrambled to button his shirt, grabbing his jacket. "Leaving! Already gone!"

As the crowd dispersed, Evelyn caught Nathaniel's sleeve. "Shall we return to the party?" Her smile didn't reach her eyes. "Unless you have more... accusations to make?"
###Chapter 495

Samuel's sharp gaze swept over Evelyn. His frown deepened when he noticed her bare shoulders. "Where's the coat I gave you?"

Evelyn glanced down, realizing with a start that the coat was missing. 'Damn it!'

The coat must have slipped off when she climbed through the bathroom window into the adjacent room. Pregnancy had dulled her reflexes - a mistake she'd never have made before.

She forced a calm smile. "My apologies, Mr. Sinclair. I accidentally spilled wine on it, so I left it downstairs. I'll reimburse you at full price. Just notify HR to deduct it from my paycheck."

Samuel felt a pang of guilt for his earlier suspicion. He waved dismissively. "Don't worry about it. It's just a coat."

"Thank you, Mr. Sinclair." Evelyn exhaled quietly.

Beside them, Amelia clenched her teeth. That coat had been a limited-edition designer piece she'd personally selected for her brother.

'Since when does Samuel care so little about his belongings? Is Evelyn really that special to him?'

She'd severely underestimated this secretary. Never had she seen her usually indifferent brother show such leniency toward any woman.

"What's all this commotion?" A commanding female voice cut through the crowd. The tone carried both elegance and authority.

"Madam Sterling!"

"Good evening, Madam Sterling!"

The crowd parted for a striking woman in her thirties, her sapphire mermaid gown radiating sophistication.

Amelia rushed forward eagerly. "Aunt Beatrice!"

Gabrielle seized the opportunity to flatter. "Madam Sterling, that gown is exquisite! You look absolutely divine tonight!"

The woman barely acknowledged Gabrielle, ignored Amelia's eager smile, and fixed her piercing gaze on Samuel. "Explain this gathering, nephew."

"Minor incident. Already resolved." Samuel replied curtly.

Madam Sterling detested disorder - especially at her meticulously planned birthday gala.

"Who's your companion tonight, Samuel?" Her sharp eyes landed on Evelyn. "I don't recognize this woman."

"My plus-one," Samuel said simply. "Also my new executive assistant."

Evelyn offered a polite nod. "Evelyn Whitmore, at your service, Madam Sterling. It's an honor to attend your event."

Madam Sterling's assessing gaze swept over Evelyn's attire. "Is that Valentina's 'Starlight Veil' collection?"
###Chapter 496

Evelyn's lips curved into a warm smile. "Indeed, Madam. Your keen eye for fashion is remarkable—to recognize the designer at first glance!"

Beatrice maintained her poised, unreadable expression. "I attended the runway show when Valentina debuted this collection. It made quite an impression. You've excellent taste, my dear. Frankly, this dress suits you better than their professional models."

The compliment didn't fluster Evelyn. She beamed openly. "You're too kind, Beatrice."

The older woman studied Evelyn with growing admiration. There was something inexplicably familiar about this young woman she couldn't quite place.

After another appraising look, Beatrice made her offer. "I'm Beatrice Sterling, editor-in-chief of Vogue Elite. Have you considered modeling for our publication?"

At 168cm, Evelyn wasn't runway tall, but her proportions were perfection. Her delicate yet vibrant features held that rare quality the fashion world coveted.

Evelyn politely declined. "I'm afraid I've just joined Mr. Sinclair's company. Changing careers isn't in my plans."

Beatrice's gaze turned pitying. "What a waste of beauty behind a desk."

Evelyn's smile turned diplomatic. "I'm honored by your offer. While I won't leave my position, I'd be happy to assist with photoshoots after hours." She glanced at Samuel with respectful inquiry. "Provided my employer approves, of course."

Before Samuel could respond, Beatrice intervened with familial authority. "No need for his permission. My nephew wouldn't dare refuse his aunt borrowing an employee occasionally." She extended her phone. "Evelyn, was it? Give me your contact details."

Samuel could only acquiesce to his aunt's request. Evelyn accepted the phone, inputting her number under Beatrice's approving gaze.

Nearby, Gabrielle's expression soured. Watching Evelyn effortlessly gain Beatrice's favor felt like witnessing daylight robbery.

Beatrice Sterling—the notorious "Fashion Queen"—only featured global icons in Vogue Elite. That this provincial nobody could catch her eye was incomprehensible.

Amelia stepped forward with practiced grace. "Aunt Beatrice, you never mentioned needing models. I'd be delighted to assist during my sabbatical." She shot Evelyn a pointed look. "Samuel's company keeps his staff quite occupied. His secretary won't have time for side projects."

Beatrice's assessing gaze turned to her niece. "It's not about willingness, Amelia. Your aesthetic doesn't align with Vogue Elite's brand—we seek uniqueness, freedom, unforgettable presence."

Amelia's smile faltered. "I... see. Perhaps I overestimated my qualifications."

Gabrielle bristled at her friend's humiliation. "Amelia placed in Miss World's finals! She'd have won if not for health issues!"

Beatrice gave Gabrielle a dismissive glance before addressing Amelia. "Beauty pageants are irrelevant. You lack the effortless confidence we seek. Vogue Elite celebrates individuality—not conventional perfection." Her tone softened marginally. "Focus on your health, dear. Leave modeling to professionals."
###Chapter 497

Beatrice Sterling had never approved of Amelia.

From childhood, Amelia lacked backbone. Her obsession with men—especially Nathaniel—made her weak. Nothing disgusted Beatrice more than women who couldn't stand on their own. If Amelia weren't her niece, she wouldn't waste a glance on her.

Gabrielle Winslow frowned. She shot Evelyn Whitmore—the woman she despised—a sharp look. "Is Evelyn really more beautiful than Amelia? I don't see it."

Beatrice turned to study Evelyn again, admiration flashing in her eyes.

"She's different. Soft features, but her expression? Unbreakable. Her gaze? Steel. And that aura—like men and power mean nothing to her. That’s the essence of Vogue Elite."

Gabrielle bit her lip, irritation flaring. To her, Evelyn was nothing but a schemer, weaving spells even over strong women like Beatrice.

Amelia's face twisted with humiliation. Her aunt had just shredded her dignity in front of everyone.

Beatrice was a fashion tyrant, cold to the entire family. Yet here she was, fawning over Evelyn—even offering her a modeling gig.

Gabrielle tried defending Amelia, but Beatrice didn’t budge. No lifeline. No escape from the shame.

Amelia burned with embarrassment. She scanned the crowd for her brother Samuel, hoping he’d shield her. Then—her breath caught.

Beyond the sea of faces stood a familiar silhouette. The man she’d been aching to see.

Her pulse spiked. "Nathaniel! When did you get here?"

Nathaniel Grayson loomed at the crowd’s edge, his height and presence cutting through the chatter like a blade.

Nathaniel? Here?!

Evelyn’s heart lurched. She whipped her head toward the voice.

There he was. A statue of ice, radiating cold. Why? The Graysons never attend Rivera events.

Her fingers curled into fists. After all this time, she’d run into him anyway.

Amelia pushed through the crowd, hurrying toward him. "You left for a business trip yesterday. What brought you back so soon?"
###Chapter 498

Nathaniel Grayson's unexpected arrival sent shockwaves through the gathering. The murmurs began instantly.

"Is that really Nathaniel Grayson at the Rivers' party?"

"He must have come for Miss Amelia! How romantic that he's willing to cross family lines for love!"

"Looks like the Rivers and Graysons might finally be ending their feud!"

"I heard he defied his entire family to propose to Miss Amelia!"

"Ugh, she's so lucky! First a doting brother, now this gorgeous billionaire fiancé?"

The whispers grew louder as Nathaniel lowered his gaze to meet Amelia's expectant eyes.

"Yes."

That single word carried volumes. His deep voice resonated with quiet confidence, making their connection seem far more intimate than anyone imagined.

It spoke of a relationship where words weren't necessary - where two people understood each other perfectly.

Samuel Rivers' eyes narrowed dangerously at the sight of his sister standing so close to Nathaniel. He hadn't anticipated this intrusion.

Instinctively, his gaze flicked to Evelyn Whitmore, searching for any reaction.

Evelyn remained impassive, her expression unreadable.

But Beatrice Sterling wasn't so restrained. She shot Nathaniel an icy glare before turning her disapproving stare toward her lovestruck niece.

Her designer heels clicked sharply as she approached. "I don't recall extending you an invitation, Mr. Grayson. Is crashing parties standard behavior for your family?"

Nathaniel's frosty gaze remained fixed on one person across the room. After a long moment, he finally acknowledged Beatrice. "My apologies. I'm here to find someone."

Beatrice arched a perfectly sculpted brow. "Who exactly could you be searching for at my birthday celebration?"

"A woman."

Beatrice couldn't care less about Nathaniel's mysterious quarry. Her rules had been broken, and that was unacceptable.

"Not only do you arrive uninvited, but you dare bring a female companion? Have you no respect for protocol?"

Nathaniel's lips thinned as he prepared to respond.

Amelia quickly intervened with a bright smile. "Aunt Beatrice, Nathaniel came to see me! I'm his companion for the evening!"

Beatrice's disgust deepened at her niece's pathetic eagerness. Though she shot Amelia a withering look, she held her tongue.

Nathaniel ignored Amelia completely. Instead, he moved purposefully through the crowd in a straight line toward one particular woman.

Evelyn's breath caught. 'Not again. Why can't he just leave me alone?'

She braced herself, determined to maintain her composure no matter what Nathaniel did next.

His intense gaze never wavered as he closed the distance between them, his focus absolute.
###Chapter 499

Nathaniel was mere inches from colliding with Evelyn when he effortlessly sidestepped her, continuing his path without breaking stride.

Evelyn's body tensed momentarily, her expression freezing.

"It's late, Sophia. Why aren't you home? Who authorized you to be here?" His deep voice carried an unmistakable reprimand as he addressed someone behind Evelyn.

Evelyn turned to see Sophia Bennett standing awkwardly among the gathered crowd. The young woman crossed her arms defiantly. "I was just socializing after work! It's not like I committed a crime!"

Sophia pouted at Nathaniel before sneaking a quick wave and mischievous grin at Evelyn.

Realization dawned on Evelyn - Nathaniel had come for Sophia, not her. 'He didn't even react to Amelia earlier. This couldn't have worked out better.'

Amelia Rivers chose that moment to brush past Evelyn, moving close to Nathaniel's side. "When did you arrive, Sophia?" she asked warmly. "I didn't see you earlier."

Sophia's nose wrinkled slightly as she gave Amelia a dismissive look. "I've been here awhile. Dancing downstairs with friends until I heard about the commotion up here. Didn't expect to run into Aunt—"

Nathaniel's glacial stare cut her off mid-sentence. Though his expression remained neutral, the dangerous undercurrent in his gaze made Sophia swallow hard.

"Go home," Nathaniel commanded sternly. "Lucas is waiting at the entrance."

Sophia huffed but knew better than to disobey. "Fine! I'm going!" she muttered, cheeks flushing with embarrassment at being scolded like a child in public.

As she passed Evelyn, Sophia rolled her eyes dramatically and stuck out her tongue in a playful gesture that made Evelyn's lips twitch with suppressed amusement. Some things never changed.

Once Sophia departed, Amelia sighed. "Don't you think you're too hard on her? She could have stayed longer. My driver could have taken her home later."

"She's uncontrollable when she's in one of her moods," Nathaniel replied dismissively.

Amelia smiled gently. "She reminds me of Benjamin - stubborn but good-hearted."

Nathaniel ignored her completely, his intense gaze locking onto Evelyn instead. The weight of his attention made Evelyn's pulse quicken despite her composed exterior. Every instinct screamed at her to escape the suffocating tension.
###Chapter 500

A sudden tension gripped the air, silencing the entire room. Everyone sensed something peculiar in the way Nathaniel's piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn, Samuel's secretary.

His expression shifted between conflict and something far more dangerous, sending shivers through those who noticed.

Beatrice Sterling caught Nathaniel's unusual focus too. It made no sense for him to stare so intently at a mere secretary.

'First he strings Amelia along, now this?' she thought bitterly. 'Typical man. Always wanting more. Though I can't blame his taste—Evelyn is striking enough to turn any head.'

Disgusted, Beatrice nearly signaled her staff to remove him when one of her attendants rushed over.

"Madam Sterling!" he whispered urgently. "The patriarch requests your immediate presence. He says it's critical."

Beatrice frowned. "Did he say why?"

"No, ma'am. Only that it couldn't wait."

With a curt nod to her guests, Beatrice followed the servant out.

The tension broke like a spell. Whispers erupted.

"Why is Mr. Grayson staring at that woman?"
"Do they know each other?"
"Amelia's right beside him, yet he hasn't glanced her way once!"
"What's happening?"

Amelia's smile tightened as the murmurs reached her. She tugged Nathaniel's sleeve coyly. "You must be exhausted from your trip. Would you like to rest?"

His eyes never left Evelyn. "No. I'm leaving."

Amelia's face faltered. "I'll come with you."

Samuel finally intervened. "You just arrived. Stay for a drink."

Gabrielle moved strategically to block Evelyn from view. "Dominic and Harrison are here too."

Nathaniel's expression remained icy. "Another time."

As he passed Evelyn, he paused abruptly. Their eyes met—his glacial, hers wary. Then he continued walking without a word.

Amelia hurried after him, secretly relieved he'd ignored Evelyn completely.

Evelyn exhaled slowly. She'd been foolish to worry. Their business concluded months ago—she meant nothing to him now. That brief panic when their eyes met? Just residual nerves.

The party resumed its rhythm. Gabrielle shot Evelyn a triumphant look before approaching Samuel with flushed cheeks. "Would you... care to dance?"

Samuel ignored the invitation. "Please escort Amelia home. It's late."
