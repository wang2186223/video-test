###Chapter 1

The storm raged outside, howling winds slashing rain against the towering windows of the Blackwood mansion. In the vast estate, only one bedroom remained illuminated.

Olivia Sinclair sat propped against the headboard, her fingers tracing the pages of a novel as sleep threatened to claim her.

Without warning, the door burst open. Olivia startled, her gaze snapping up to meet the imposing figure of her husband, Liam Blackwood, framed in the doorway.

Liam stood there, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit, his striking features darkened by a scowl. Before Olivia could react, his lips crashed against hers, the bitter tang of whiskey mingling with the crisp scent of rain. His chilled fingers slid beneath her nightgown, gripping her thigh with bruising force despite her resistance.

"Don't move," he commanded, his voice thick with alcohol and something darker.

Olivia stilled instantly, pain radiating through her as muffled whimpers escaped her throat. Liam's frown deepened at the sound, and he clamped a hand over her mouth. Silenced, she clung to his muscular forearm like a lifeline in a tempest, her knuckles whitening with the effort. The storm within her only subsided when Liam finally released her and stalked toward the ensuite.

The moment the bathroom door clicked shut, Liam's phone lit up on the nightstand. Against her better judgment, Olivia glanced at the screen flashing with a new message: "Liam, I'm sorry. Must you always run to your mute wife when we fight? It's killing me."

The light drained from Olivia's eyes. She would never master the art of playful banter or whispered confessions in the dark.

Childhood illness had stolen her voice, leaving only broken sounds that even her husband couldn't bear to hear.

Through the frosted glass, Olivia could make out Liam's tall silhouette. She quickly averted her gaze.

Emerging with a towel slung around his hips, Liam raked fingers through damp hair before fixing her with a glacial stare. "Did you look at my phone?"

Olivia tensed, shaking her head frantically in denial. She longed to explain it had been accidental.

But Liam's patience had evaporated. "Don't touch my things," he bit out.

Forcing a smile, Olivia bit her lip and nodded. She knew better than to expect Liam's affection. Their marriage had been Henry Winslow's dying wish - a union between his grandson and his ward. Liam had made it clear he'd only married her to honor his grandfather, not out of any desire for the silent girl he'd grown up with.

Five years of marriage had taught Olivia her place. She turned a blind eye to his affairs, terrified of becoming another burden.

Drawing a shaky breath, she gestured toward the kitchen, offering to fetch him warm milk. Unable to bear his indifferent stare, she fled the room.

Behind her, Liam picked up his phone and deleted the message without reading it.

Dawn found Olivia already in the kitchen. Liam's notoriously sensitive stomach demanded careful attention, and for years she'd risen early to prepare his breakfast.

When Liam descended the staircase, his gaze immediately found Olivia moving about the kitchen. The apron strings accentuated her slender waist, while the fading marks on her neck bore witness to last night's passion. She embodied the perfect wife - gentle, undemanding, never making scenes.

Something unreadable flickered across Liam's usually impassive face. "Join me for breakfast," he said, breaking their usual routine.

Olivia's face lit up as she nodded eagerly, signing her thanks. Slipping off her apron, she took the seat beside him - closer than usual. When Liam passed her a croissant, she accepted it with cautious delight.

"Richard's hosting the hundred-day celebration for his son tomorrow," Liam remarked casually. "You'll accompany me."

Olivia nearly dropped the pastry in shock. Public appearances together were rare. Her eyes darted with hesitation before she schooled her features.

"My assistant will deliver appropriate attire tomorrow," Liam continued. "Be ready by noon."

Olivia had no choice but to agree.

The Winslow family's influence in Newport meant Richard Winslow's celebration would be a lavish affair at the city's most exclusive hotel, already buzzing with anticipation.

Dressed in a champagne-colored gown with subtle makeup enhancing her delicate features, Olivia should have been radiant. Yet the glances thrown her way carried pity rather than admiration.

"How lucky to be mute yet marry so well," one guest whispered. "Perhaps if I stopped talking..."

"Don't be absurd," another scoffed. "Henry Winslow only took her in out of pity after her parents died. That's the only reason Liam married her."

Olivia's hands clenched at the unfairness, but her silent defense went unheard.

"Olivia! There you are!" A voice cut through the murmurs.
###Chapter 2

A honeyed voice floated through the air. It belonged to Olivia's sister-in-law, Catherine Winslow, who cradled her infant daughter while giving Olivia a knowing smile.

"Why don't you hold little Zuri for good luck?" Catherine suggested sweetly. "You and Liam have been married five years without any news. Perhaps this will help things along."

All eyes in the room turned toward Olivia, their gazes sharp enough to pierce skin. Olivia's palms grew damp with nervous perspiration.

Catherine continued in that saccharine tone, "No one faults you for your condition, dear. But being sweet isn't enough for a wife. How can you fulfill your duties if you can't give Liam an heir?"

Olivia's cheeks burned with humiliation as she reached for the baby. But before she could take her, another pair of hands intervened.

Margaret Winslow, Olivia's mother-in-law, snatched the infant away protectively. "This child is perfectly healthy. We can't risk her catching any bad luck or illness from your touch."

Olivia's heart plummeted. She desperately tried to explain through sign language that infertility wasn't the issue. The truth was—

The gathered relatives exchanged confused glances at Olivia's silent gestures. Margaret cut her off sharply. "Even if you could conceive, we wouldn't want you to. What if the child inherits your... condition? That would be unacceptable!"

Murmurs of agreement rippled through the crowd. "Absolutely," someone said. "We must consider the family legacy."

A chill ran down Olivia's spine. If she couldn't provide an heir, would that other woman—the one Liam truly loved—step in? The truth was, she wasn't infertile. She'd gotten pregnant once before. But Margaret, insisting the child might inherit Olivia's muteness and that Liam wouldn't want such a child, had forced her to terminate the pregnancy.

Olivia had been unable to explain that her muteness resulted from childhood illness, not genetics. She'd wept silently through the procedure, the pain lingering far longer than she'd anticipated.

Catherine sighed dramatically. "Margaret, I understand your concerns. But I've only managed one daughter with difficult complications that may prevent future pregnancies. If Olivia can't conceive, the Winslow line could end with our generation."

Turning to Liam with doe eyes, Catherine asked, "Liam darling, what do you think about all this?"

The room held its breath, dozens of eyes fixed on Liam, anticipating fireworks.

Everyone knew Liam had been forced into this marriage. A public rejection of his mute wife would make sensational headlines.

Instead, Liam's expression turned glacial. "You're talking too much," he said icily. "What exactly are you implying?"

Catherine's smile faltered, realizing she'd miscalculated.

Margaret jumped in to smooth things over. "Your sister-in-law only speaks out of concern for you. There's no need for such rudeness."

Catherine lowered her eyes demurely. "Richard is away on business, and I've been managing everything alone since the baby came. I only meant to show I care. Please forgive me if I overstepped."

Liam's skepticism was palpable. "If household duties overwhelm you, perhaps you should relinquish them," he said coldly.

He signaled to his assistant, Sebastian Montgomery. "Set the gifts aside. My personal life isn't open for discussion," he declared firmly.

In the stunned silence that followed, Liam guided Olivia from the party, leaving behind a room full of shocked expressions.

Olivia moved in a daze, barely processing events until they were seated in the car. She never expected Liam to defend her so publicly.

Liam's brow furrowed slightly. "Ignore them," he muttered, annoyance coloring his tone.

Olivia shook her head, indicating their words hadn't affected her.

This only seemed to irritate Liam further. "So in five years of marriage, have you truly never considered having children with me?"

Olivia had always been the perfect, compliant wife, her devotion to Liam unquestionable. But her apparent indifference to motherhood now made him doubt her feelings.

The truth was, Olivia had dreamed of bearing Liam's child since their wedding day. But with Margaret's interference, she knew it would remain just a dream. Was Liam testing her now?

Hesitating, Olivia finally signed that they should let the matter drop. She feared, as Margaret claimed, that her child might inherit her silence.

Liam's gaze turned piercing. "You're saying you don't want my child? Yet unless I'm mistaken, we were quite careless last night, and you haven't taken any precautions since."
###Chapter 3

Olivia gestured subtly, indicating last night hadn't been during her ovulation window. A shadow of disappointment crossed Liam's piercing blue eyes as he murmured, "I see you've been keeping track."

She missed the fleeting emotion, assuming his disinterest in fatherhood extended beyond their contractual marriage. Turning toward the window, Olivia absently traced patterns on the glass as Manhattan's skyline blurred past.

"Would you prefer shopping on Fifth Avenue? Or perhaps a private spa session at Blanc de Noir? I can have Victoria accompany you," Liam offered, his deep voice cutting through the luxury sedan's silence.

Olivia shook her head, signing rapidly that her design studio awaited her attention.

Liam adjusted his platinum cufflinks. "You're the creative director, not a slave to the company. As Mrs. Blackwood, your only duty is enjoying the lifestyle I provide." His gaze dropped to the diamond bracelet encircling her wrist - last month's anniversary gift.

Materially, Liam was the perfect husband. A penthouse on Central Park West. A black AmEx with no spending limit. Staff to handle every domestic chore. Yet Olivia's heart ached for the boy who'd once whispered promises of forever against her skin when they were seventeen.

The sudden halt of the Mercedes jerked Olivia from her memories. A sharp rapping on the tinted window startled her.

The descending glass revealed Evelyn Hartley's tear-streaked face, her normally flawless makeup ruined by swollen, bloodshot eyes. The sight twisted something painful in Olivia's chest.

"Three days!" Evelyn choked out before Olivia could react. Her manicured fingers gripped the window frame like a lifeline. "I waited at the penthouse, called your office, even checked the usual restaurants. Then your assistant mentioned the hundred-day celebration for your nephew..." Her voice broke. "Are you punishing me? Is that why you're hiding behind your... wife?"

The unspoken insult hung in the air like poison. Olivia stiffened, her hands curling into fists in her lap.

Liam's expression remained impassive, though his knuckles whitened on the steering wheel. "Do you understand why I'm angry?"

Evelyn's pout was practiced perfection. "If you want an apology, darling, at least let me in from the cold. How can I properly beg forgiveness out here?"

Her emerald eyes flicked meaningfully toward Olivia's seat.

After a weighted pause, Liam turned to Olivia. "Your studio is just ahead. Don't you have that fabric shipment arriving?"

In truth, they were still blocks from Sinclair Designs. Normally Liam insisted on door-to-door service. Swallowing the lump in her throat, Olivia gathered her purse and stepped into the autumn chill without protest.

Evelyn made a show of extracting antibacterial wipes from her Birkin, meticulously sanitizing the leather seat before sliding in. The implication was clear - she considered Olivia's presence contaminating.

Liam's brow furrowed. "What's this about?"

"You know I have OCD," Evelyn sniffed, pressing a hand to her chest. "We had an agreement - front seat privileges when you drive, backseat exclusivity when your driver's behind the wheel." Her gaze slid triumphantly to where Olivia stood frozen on the sidewalk. "Unless you've changed the rules without telling me?"

The barb found its mark. Olivia turned sharply, heels clicking against pavement as she hurried toward her studio's awning.

Through the rearview mirror, Liam watched Olivia's retreat, guilt gnawing at him. When Evelyn tried to embrace him, he stiff-armed her away.

"Please," Evelyn whispered, clinging like ivy. "I'll behave. No more ultimatums about the divorce. Just forgive me." A single tear tracked down her cheek - a calculated masterpiece of vulnerability.

Liam sighed, his resistance crumbling as he cupped her delicate jaw. "Last chance, Evie. Be good, and you'll want for nothing." His thumb brushed away her tear. "Except my last name."

The engine purred to life as Olivia disappeared around the corner, her silhouette swallowed by the morning crowd.
###Chapter 4

Evelyn's eyes burned with resentment. Why had Olivia held the title of Mrs. Blackwood for so long when she was utterly undeserving? The injustice of it gnawed at her soul.

Yet her voice dripped with saccharine sweetness. "Of course, she's the respectable Mrs. Blackwood, while I'm just the shameful mistress who deserves everyone's scorn."

Liam ran his fingers through her hair absentmindedly. "Don't be ridiculous."

"Is it ridiculous?" Evelyn's voice trembled with manufactured vulnerability. "I was your first love, your real girlfriend. Now the whole world thinks you betrayed her for me, painting me as some homewrecker." She bit her lip dramatically. "After all I've suffered, don't I deserve some compensation?"

A lazy smirk played on Liam's lips as he loosened his tie. "Fine. What do you want this time?"

Evelyn studied his expression before whispering, "I've been dreaming about that limited edition Aston Martin coupe. It's not even available in the country yet, but I—"

"Buy it," Liam interrupted without hesitation.

Her eyes lit up as she pressed further. "And maybe a Chanel Gabrielle bag? I know it's not that expensive, but the waiting list is impossible unless—"

"Get whatever you want. The entire collection if it makes you happy," Liam said with disinterest.

Evelyn nearly squealed with delight, throwing her arms around him and planting a loud kiss on his cheek. "Darling, I knew you'd spoil me! I promise I'll stop complaining. Our happiness is all that matters!" She beamed at him.

Liam's expression remained unreadable. "Consider it an early birthday gift."

Her face scrunched in an exaggerated pout. "You remembered my birthday? Then why have you been avoiding me? As punishment, you're forbidden from going home next week or seeing your wife. You're spending every minute with me!"

The memory of Olivia's quiet dignity in the car earlier sent an unexpected pang through Liam's chest. Irritated by the sensation, he agreed instantly. "Fine. Whatever you want."

Overjoyed, Evelyn lunged for another embrace.

Liam caught her shoulders to prevent her from hitting the car roof, missing the calculating glint in her eyes as she shifted positions.

Meanwhile, from the bookstore across the street, Olivia stood frozen by the floor-to-ceiling windows. The car hadn't moved, its window still down, giving her a perfect view of Evelyn now straddling Liam's lap, their bodies swaying together.

Though Evelyn's position blocked Liam's face, Olivia could imagine his expression - the same look of contentment he'd once reserved for her.

Tears welled up silently, tracing paths through her carefully applied makeup.

A warm cup of tea appeared in her line of vision.

Natalie followed Olivia's gaze and immediately bristled with indignation. "How do you live like this? He's practically having sex with his mistress in broad daylight! The whole world thinks you're the villain here, when clearly—" She cut herself off with a frustrated noise. "You may not speak, but you outshine her in every way. Any man who cheats isn't worth your tears. I wouldn't take him if he were the last man on earth!"

After years working together, Natalie had become more than a colleague - she was Olivia's fiercest protector and closest friend.

Olivia turned away, signing her gratitude with trembling hands.

"This marriage isn't worth your pain," Natalie murmured, pulling her into a hug. "If you ever get the chance to leave, take it."

Concern etched Natalie's features as she added, "I brought you some pastries. Something sweet might help. Forget about the hotel delivery today - I'll handle the promotional materials. You should rest."

The delivery involved hundreds of heavy magazines requiring multiple trips. Guilt twisted in Olivia's chest at the thought of burdening Natalie.

She signed quickly, insisting she could manage her responsibilities.

Natalie refused to back down.

After a silent standoff, they compromised - they would make the delivery together.
###Chapter 5

The luxury hotel stretched endlessly before them, a glittering maze where Olivia and Natalie were merely delivering magazines. Olivia headed toward the East Wing while Natalie disappeared into the West Wing.

Pushing a cart overflowing with glossy publications, Olivia searched for the service elevator when a venomous voice sliced through the air behind her.

"Pathetic. Resorting to magazine deliveries just to stalk Liam? I could've simply given you a room key if you're this desperate."

Olivia froze mid-step before slowly turning to face Evelyn, whose smug expression shattered the demure mask she wore around Liam.

A subtle tension tightened Olivia's features as she gestured for Evelyn to move aside.

But Evelyn wasn't finished. Her voice turned razor-sharp. "Did you follow him here hoping to catch us together? Maybe burst in at the perfect moment?" The words dripped with cruel amusement.

Olivia's hands flew in denial, but Evelyn cut her off with a sneer. "Or were you hoping to witness something more... intimate? Wake up, darling. Know your place."

Olivia's response came swift and sharp through sign language - it was Evelyn who needed reminding of her place, since Liam would never love this vicious version of her.

Though Olivia had never felt inferior because of her muteness - except around Liam - she hated how it silenced her against Evelyn's cruelty.

Evelyn's smirk widened. "I don't speak hand puppetry. Let me enlighten you. You think you deserve to be his wife? To Liam, you're nothing but a well-trained pet."

Olivia's eyes flashed. She struggled to form words through damaged vocal cords. "Lies!"

"Don't strain yourself," Evelyn mocked. "Why waste breath explaining when you could just whimper like the dog you are?"

A pause, then Evelyn's voice turned saccharine. "Oh wait - you can't even do that properly. Why don't you crawl on all fours to complete the picture?"

Evelyn's gaze burned with contempt.

Suddenly, fingers tangled viciously in Evelyn's hair. "You shameless homewrecker! How dare you torment Liam's wife? Can't you tell disgrace from decency, you viper?"

The grip nearly scalped Evelyn, her scream piercing the hallway as she flailed against her attacker.

Natalie moved like lightning, catching Evelyn's swinging arm and delivering a stinging slap across her face.

"You dare strike back? Who do you think you're dealing with?" Natalie's voice could have frozen hell.

Stumbling in her designer heels, Evelyn crashed backward from the force, landing at Olivia's feet.

Then - like flipping a switch - Evelyn's expression melted into pitiful terror. She clutched at Olivia's legs. "Please! I didn't mean any harm! Liam and I have history since childhood - I never wanted to come between you! Don't hurt me!"

Olivia stood paralyzed, shocked by Evelyn's sudden transformation.

A cold voice shattered the moment. "Olivia. Explain your presence here."

Evelyn turned tear-filled eyes toward the voice. "Liam, don't blame her! This is all my fault! Whatever she does to me, I deserve it—"

Natalie scoffed loudly. "Don't flatter yourself. I'm the one who slapped this snake. Olivia didn't lay a finger on her."

Liam helped Evelyn up, his expression unreadable as his icy gaze locked onto Olivia. "I expected better from you."
###Chapter 6

Tears shimmered in Olivia's eyes, but she clenched her jaw, refusing to let them fall. Her hand lifted instinctively toward Liam, but he'd already turned away, his broad shoulders radiating cold finality.

"Wait for me!" Evelyn's voice rang out as she rushed forward. Her fingers interlaced with Liam's as if they belonged together.

"Why is she even at this hotel? Either she's here to cause drama or meeting someone else. Honestly!" Evelyn whispered just loud enough to be heard. Liam's steps faltered momentarily at her words.

Instead of stopping, Liam violently yanked his hand free. "Enough!" he snapped.

As Liam slid into his luxury car, thunder rumbled ominously in the distance. The skies opened as Evelyn stepped outside, her designer dress instantly drenched. Her perfectly styled hair now plastered to her face as she ran toward the car, fingers grasping at the door handle.

To her shock, it remained locked. "Liam, open up!" she pleaded, pounding on the tinted window.

Then came the mocking voice from behind her. "Pathetic."

Evelyn whirled to see Natalie standing under the hotel awning, arms crossed, a smirk playing on her lips.

"She attacked me earlier, and now she's—" Evelyn's eyes flashed with venom before quickly morphing into wounded innocence as she tapped the window again.

"Cut the act. Just check the security footage," Natalie's sharp voice cut through the rain. "Liam, be a decent man. Stay faithful to your wife instead of risking diseases with shameless women. Think about Olivia!"

"You!" Rage contorted Evelyn's features at the insult. She turned to confront Natalie, but the roar of Liam's engine drowned her out as he drove away.

"Olivia, let's go," Natalie said firmly, shooting Evelyn one last scathing look before guiding Olivia back inside to finish their work.

When closing time arrived, the storm showed no signs of relenting.

"I'll drive you home," Natalie offered, helping Olivia into a raincoat.

Olivia shook her head hesitantly. Natalie's place was in the opposite direction.

"Then take a cab. Don't save that bastard's money!" Natalie huffed.

Olivia managed a weak smile and nodded.

But no taxi would venture so far in such weather. By the time Olivia reached home via subway, her clothes were soaked through, her lips blue from cold.

Shivering violently, Olivia pressed her finger to the biometric lock—only to find it unresponsive. Liam had locked her out.

"Sir..." The butler hesitated, glancing at the torrential rain outside. But under Liam's imposing glare, he remained silent.

The study lay in darkness, Liam's silhouette barely visible as he sat motionless. His eyes remained fixed on the security footage playing across his screen, emotions churning like the storm outside. What had Olivia been doing at that hotel?

Liam meticulously reviewed every angle—Olivia and Natalie's arrival, their encounter with Evelyn, Olivia's departure. She'd merely been delivering books.

"How long has she been back?" Liam's voice softened slightly after watching the final clip.

"About an hour..." the butler murmured, eyes downcast. "Your wife has been at the door this entire time."

Another thunderclap shook the mansion, lightning illuminating the rain-lashed windows.

Olivia had always been terrified of thunderstorms. As a child, she'd hide under blankets during storms. Now she stood alone in the downpour.

Liam remained silent, his expression unreadable as he pushed past the butler and descended the grand staircase. Peering through the rain-streaked glass, he assumed Olivia had left.

But when he opened the door, he found Olivia collapsed on the marble steps, unconscious, her skin ice-cold to the touch.
###Chapter 7

"Olivia!" Liam's voice was laced with alarm as he rushed forward to scoop her up, his command to the butler slicing through the storm's roar. "Get Dr. Carter here now!"

Despite wearing a raincoat, the torrential downpour had soaked Olivia to the bone.

Without hesitation, Liam stripped the drenched clothing from her trembling body and snatched a towel from the maid to wrap around her. Only then did Liam truly notice Olivia's fragility - her waist so slender it seemed his hands could span it completely.

Just then, Ryan Carter's voice cut through the tension, teasing yet concerned. "What's this, Liam? Financial troubles? Forcing your wife to work in a bookstore to pay the bills? You're running her ragged!"

As the family physician, Ryan arrived promptly, though his long friendship with Liam never tempered his blunt commentary.

"Enough jokes. Just treat her!" Liam barked, stepping back from Olivia with a stern expression.

"If she'd been out there much longer, hypothermia could have set in beyond recovery. What were you thinking, Liam? Hoping for a tragic accident to collect her life insurance?" Ryan didn't hold back as he examined Olivia, his sarcasm biting. "I won't cover for you - not for less than twenty million!"

"Shut your damn mouth!" Liam snapped, anger overtaking his worry. Recognizing the line had been crossed, Ryan ceased his remarks with a grunt.

Olivia's ordeal in the storm had taken its toll. Her body temperature had plummeted dangerously before spiking into a raging fever.

Ryan administered fever reducers and assured Liam there was no cause for alarm.

Standing beside the bed, Liam studied Olivia's flushed face, his brow furrowed. After a long moment, he turned away with a sharp command to the butler. "Ensure she receives proper care. You'll answer to me if anything goes wrong!"

Olivia remained unconscious until morning. Descending the stairs, she expected to find Liam already gone. To her surprise, he remained in the living room.

"Feeling better?" Liam asked, spotting her on the staircase.

Olivia froze, her fingers twisting anxiously. Had his refusal to open the door last night signaled his intention to divorce her?

"Don't bother returning to that job. I can provide for us," Liam stated, surveying the room before fixing his piercing gaze on Olivia, impatience coloring his tone.

Panic surged through Olivia as she hurried down to face him, gesturing frantically about how much she loved her work.

"Is working at that bookstore truly necessary?" Liam pressed, his sharp stare cutting through her. "I'll establish a bookstore for you. Stay away from Natalie. I don't approve of her." His dislike for Natalie's comments yesterday was evident.

Guilt gnawing at her, Olivia raised her hands to explain, but Liam had already turned to leave. Desperate, she reached out and grabbed his sleeve.

"Something else?"

Olivia gestured for Liam to wait, dashed upstairs, and returned moments later with a document which she thrust into his hands.

"A divorce agreement?" Liam let out a harsh laugh at the title, not bothering to read it before tossing it aside. "You'd divorce me over this petty issue? Why are you being so dramatic?"

Olivia retrieved the papers from the floor and shoved them back at Liam, her expression resolute.

"Seriously, you want a divorce?" Liam's face darkened. "Fine. Leave with nothing. Return every cent I've given you, then I'll consider letting you go."

Liam expected his words would make Olivia reconsider. Instead, to his shock, she immediately produced a bank card. She placed both card and agreement on the table, explaining through gestures she'd never spent any of his money.

Liam's expression grew thunderous, his glare intensifying with barely contained rage.

Olivia took a step back, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears.

"Well then-" After a tense silence, Liam gritted his teeth. "Filing for divorce violates our families' agreement. Beyond that, you owe me fifty million in compensation! Without that payment, don't even think about walking away from me!"
###Chapter 8

Olivia's breath caught in her throat. Twenty million dollars. The staggering sum made her knees weak - more than she could possibly earn in three lifetimes. Liam was weaponizing this impossible debt to trap her in their crumbling marriage.

Noticing Olivia's hesitation, Liam let out a derisive chuckle. He opened his mouth to deliver another cutting remark when he saw her jaw tighten with sudden determination.

With trembling fingers, Olivia reached for the pen, signing her name before gesturing if she could pay in installments given the astronomical amount.

Liam's laughter turned venomous. "Installments? How many centuries would that take? Do you honestly believe your pathetic little bookshop could ever generate that kind of money?"

He turned sharply toward the door, but Olivia darted forward, blocking his path with desperate hands. Her frantic signing offered to step aside so he could marry Evelyn, believing this was what he truly wanted.

Liam froze, his expression darkening like gathering storm clouds.

Under his withering glare, Olivia shrank back, her slender frame trembling visibly.

"Twenty million. Not a cent less. Only then will I even consider discussing divorce." With violent precision, Liam shredded the documents. The sound of the slamming door echoed through the suddenly too-empty penthouse.

Olivia collapsed onto the sofa, silent tears tracing paths down her cheeks. This wasn't the Liam she once knew. Had she made a terrible mistake all those years ago? If only she'd chosen differently...

That night, the penthouse felt cavernous in its silence. Certain Liam wouldn't return, Olivia was startled when her phone buzzed at 1:17 AM. An unknown number flashed on the screen.

"Olivia Sinclair?" The male voice sounded urgent through the static.

Still groggy, Olivia managed a soft noise of acknowledgment. The caller seemed to understand her difficulty speaking and rapidly rattled off an address.

"Liam's completely wasted. Someone needs to come get him!" The line went dead before she could respond.

Heart pounding, Olivia threw on clothes, her mind racing with questions. Why would Liam's friends call her instead of Evelyn? In all their years together, she'd barely met any of his inner circle.

The taxi dropped her outside an exclusive club called Midnight. The bouncers waved her through when she showed them the text message.

Pushing open the private room's door, Olivia froze. The scene before her looked like the aftermath of a hurricane - shattered glass littering the floor, overturned furniture, and the acrid smell of spilled liquor.

Liam lounged on a leather couch, his expression thunderous despite the empty bottles surrounding him. Evelyn sat beside him, her perfect features arranged in a picture of wounded dignity.

Across from them stood Natalie, gripping a broken bottle like a weapon, while her brother Daniel positioned himself protectively in front of her. The tension in the room was so thick Olivia could almost taste it.

Without thinking, Olivia rushed forward and grabbed Natalie's wrist, her eyes wide with alarm.

"What the hell are you doing here?" Liam's voice cut through the chaos like a whip, making Olivia flinch.

Her stomach dropped. Liam wasn't nearly as drunk as the caller had claimed, and clearly didn't need her assistance.

"Olivia, don't. If groveling will satisfy Mr. Blackwood and his mistress, I'll do whatever it takes," Natalie spat, trying to shake Olivia off and raise the broken glass again.

Olivia caught her friend's arm more firmly this time, demanding answers with urgent gestures.

"It's nothing. I just couldn't stomach watching that gold-digger paw at Liam anymore, so I slapped her," Natalie said with defiant pride.

"You think assault is justified?" one of Liam's associates challenged, just as Evelyn began weeping dramatically into her hands.

"Enough! We all know Evelyn is Mr. Blackwood's favorite plaything. Why bother pretending otherwise?" Daniel interjected with biting sarcasm.

He pried the broken bottle from Natalie's grip. "Mr. Blackwood, my sister's had too much to drink. Let me handle this."

Olivia's gaze fell on the table - an array of exotic, high-proof liquors glinting under the dim lights.

"You'll kill yourself drinking all that! This is my fault anyway. I'll take responsibility for hitting her," Natalie whispered to Daniel, reaching for the bottle again.

Understanding dawned on Olivia. Natalie had struck Evelyn defending her honor. Now, with Liam furious, it fell to Olivia to bear the consequences.

The room fell silent as Olivia stepped forward and bowed deeply to Evelyn. Then she began signing her apology with graceful, practiced motions.

"What's with the hand signals? I don't understand that nonsense!" Evelyn sneered. "If you want to apologize for your rabid friend, use your words like a normal person!"

"You bitch—" Natalie started forward, but Olivia held her back.

Without hesitation, Olivia slapped herself hard across the face. She looked at Evelyn questioningly, silently asking if this satisfied her.

"That's it?" Evelyn scoffed. "Where's the sincerity? If you truly want to apologize, get on your knees!"

###Chapter 9

"Olivia!" Natalie's voice shook with barely contained fury at Evelyn's outrageous demand, her body tensed like a coiled spring. Yet Olivia didn't hesitate. She lowered herself to her knees, her face an impassive mask.

To Olivia, being beneath Evelyn when it came to Liam was an accepted reality. Any humiliation was worth enduring if it pleased Evelyn.

Liam stood motionless, his expression unreadable. The actions of others meant nothing to him.

Broken glass littered the floor around them. As Olivia's knees made contact, sharp pain lanced through her. Her body swayed slightly from the impact, yet she showed no outward sign of discomfort.

Looking up at Evelyn from her position on the floor, Olivia's face remained composed - no fear, no distress, just quiet resignation.

Evelyn, however, wasn't satisfied. "You-" she began, clearly intending to demand further degradation, when a man's voice, thick with restrained anger, cut through the tension. "Enough!"

Liam rose abruptly and strode toward Olivia.

"Liam!" Evelyn's voice cracked with panic as she grabbed at his sleeve.

Ignoring Evelyn completely, Liam bent down and scooped Olivia into his arms instead.

The room fell into stunned silence. No one had anticipated this turn of events. They watched, mouths agape, as Liam carried Olivia out, kicking the chamber door open with such force it nearly came off its hinges.

Natalie was the first to recover. She shot Evelyn a triumphant look. "See your place now? No matter what you do, Liam's heart belongs to his wife!"

Natalie's earlier anger had transformed into smug satisfaction.

Enraged, Evelyn snatched a bottle from the table and hurled it to the floor. "Get out! All of you!"

With Olivia cradled in his arms, Liam swiftly exited the bar. His driver was already waiting outside.

Upon returning to the villa, Olivia waved her hands dismissively and entered on her own. Her thick pants had protected her knees from the glass shards. She gestured to Liam, silently asking if he was alright and if he wanted some soup to sober up.

Liam remained silent, his gaze heavy with unspoken thoughts.

Olivia was confused. Liam's tolerance for alcohol was legendary, and he didn't appear intoxicated. Gathering her courage, she gestured to ask if he could go easy on Natalie.

Despite Natalie's fiery temper and tendency to hold grudges, she had always been kind to Olivia, who wanted to repay that kindness.

With resignation, Olivia added that she'd be willing to quit working at the bookstore if it meant Liam wouldn't retaliate against Natalie.

Liam's face twitched, but he stayed silent.

Olivia's anxiety spiked. Was Liam contemplating punishing Natalie because of Evelyn? The thought was unbearable. She couldn't live with herself if anything happened to Natalie because of her!

Olivia reached out and gently tugged at Liam's sleeve, her heart lifting when he didn't pull away. With tremendous effort, she managed to whisper, "Liam-" It was the only word she could produce, her damaged vocal cords making speech difficult.

At the sound of her voice, the ice in Liam's eyes seemed to melt. They had shared a joyful childhood, her presence always comforting him during difficult times, always there when he needed her most.

"Okay, for you, I'll forgive her."

Olivia's relief was palpable at Liam's promise. He was a man of his word. Once he committed to something, he never went back on it.

A radiant smile lit up Olivia's face, her eyes sparkling with emotion, and she couldn't resist pulling Liam into a tight embrace.

It had been so long since Olivia had addressed Liam in that tone.

Back in their school days, Liam had been incredibly popular, the object of countless girls' affections.

When they discovered Liam's closeness to Olivia, their jealousy turned cruel. They filled Olivia's desk with dead insects, threw her belongings in the trash, and locked her in bathrooms.

Olivia endured the bullying silently, too afraid to complain lest the Blackwoods consider her a nuisance. To ease the situation, she reluctantly kept her distance from Liam.

Now, as Liam's hand rested comfortingly on Olivia's back, he too remembered those times. Tenderly, he lifted her chin, gazing into her eyes before lowering his lips to hers, capturing her soft pink lips in a gentle kiss...
###Chapter 10

Liam's kiss tasted like expensive whiskey and his signature cologne, overwhelming Olivia's senses. She struggled for half a second before surrendering to his embrace. The moment shattered when his phone screamed through the silence.

They sprang apart like guilty teenagers. Liam snatched his phone with a scowl while Olivia retreated to the couch, staring at her hands. What exactly was she to him?

"Where are you? You promised you'd come!" Evelyn's shrill voice pierced the quiet living room.

"We agreed you'd stop seeing your mute wife! Yet you keep choosing her over me. Now when I need you, you're not here!" Evelyn's whine dissolved into theatrical sobs.

Olivia's heart sank like a stone.

"Olivia isn't well," Liam replied curtly.

"But I'm sick too! Migraine, fever, and my period's coming. Liam, don't you care?" Evelyn's sticky-sweet tone made Olivia nauseous. She approached Liam, signaling he should go.

His face darkened instantly. Was she really pushing him away? Didn't she want him anymore?

Olivia misinterpreted his expression as anger over her eavesdropping. She dropped her gaze, fingers flying in apology.

"I'm coming," Liam bit out. He stormed out without a backward glance.

Olivia stood frozen as his footsteps faded. Hot tears traced her cheeks but she didn't wipe them. How she wished she could be selfish like Evelyn, could demand his attention.

But she had no right. She'd spent years pretending not to love him. Only she knew the truth - she'd die for him without hesitation.

Morning found Olivia at the bookstore, resignation letter in hand.

"Olivia! What happened after you left yesterday? Did Liam apologize?" Natalie pounced the moment she entered.

Olivia forced a smile, hands signing that everything was fine. She couldn't admit Liam had gone straight to Evelyn.

Natalie slammed her palm on the counter. "At least he's not completely blinded by that snake!"

Olivia chuckled weakly, warning Natalie to be careful.

"I can't help it! That woman makes my blood boil! Let her call the police - I'll expose her as the homewrecker she is!"

Olivia patted Natalie's shoulder, signing frantically to keep her out of trouble.

"I know this is hard for you..." Natalie sighed.

Changing the subject, Olivia produced an envelope stuffed with cash.

"What's this?" Natalie frowned.

Olivia's serious expression conveyed her decision to quit, the money meant as compensation.

"Don't be ridiculous! Keep your money! Why quit? Is Liam forcing you? Divorce him and live with me! My family might not be as rich as the Blackwoods, but we're not afraid of him!"

Olivia's chest tightened painfully. She lied with her hands, signing Liam wanted her home more to work on their marriage.

"Really? He actually wants to fix things?" Natalie's eyes narrowed skeptically. Still, remembering how Liam had carried Olivia away yesterday made her slightly believe.

"But you shouldn't have to quit your job for a man! Though if that's your choice..." Natalie shoved the money back. "Keep this. My door's always open if you change your mind."

Olivia nodded gratefully. As she tried to stand, the room spun violently. She crumpled like a ragdoll.

"Olivia!" Natalie's scream echoed through the bookstore.

###Chapter 11

Natalie's strong arms supported Olivia as she tried to stand, but her legs trembled violently beneath her. The world spun as Olivia surrendered to Natalie's guidance, collapsing into the nearest chair. With swift movements, Natalie dialed for an ambulance while simultaneously texting Daniel.

Through the haze of dizziness, Olivia's thoughts drifted to what might have been. Had fate twisted differently, would she have chosen Daniel over Liam? After all, Daniel had once gotten down on one knee with a ring, and Natalie had always championed their union.

When Olivia's eyelids fluttered open in the sterile hospital room, Natalie's worried face hovered above her.

"How are you feeling? Any pain?" Natalie asked, fingers tightening around the bed rail.

Olivia lifted her IV-pierced arm slightly, finding comfort in the steady drip of fluids. She managed a faint smile, signing that she felt fine.

"The doctor says you have severe hypoglycemia and malnutrition," Natalie relayed, brows knitting together. "When was the last time you ate properly?"

Daniel's concerned voice came from the other side of the bed. "Olivia, how could Liam let this happen? For the Blackwood heiress to faint from hunger... Have you been skipping meals?"

Natalie slammed her palm against the mattress before immediately recoiling. "Sorry! Did I scare you?"

Olivia shook her head, fingers dancing to explain it was her own fault for neglecting meals. The truth was more painful - she'd stopped cooking elaborate dinners after months of Liam never coming home to eat them. Gradually, her own appetite had disappeared.

Seeing her friend's condition, Natalie adjusted the hospital tray, unveiling an array of Olivia's favorite dishes. "I brought everything you love. You're eating every bite today, or I'm keeping you hostage in this bed," she declared with mock sternness.

Olivia grinned as she sat up, but her smile vanished when Natalie exploded. "Liam is unbelievable! His assistant actually told me not to disturb him unless it was life-threatening. His wife collapses unconscious, and that doesn't qualify?"

Olivia's hands flew in frantic gestures, insisting she was fine now and Liam shouldn't be interrupted during important meetings. She emphasized she didn't need his attention.

Natalie opened her mouth to argue but stopped, reconsidering her words. Instead, she quietly opened a container of soup. "Just promise you'll call me if you need anything."

"You've got us both," Daniel added, stepping closer.

After hours of monitoring, Daniel and Natalie brought Olivia home.

The last person Olivia expected to see was Liam, sprawled across their living room sofa with thunderous expression.

"Where were you?" His gaze flickered over her before zeroing in on the takeout container. "Dining out?"

Olivia hastily set down the food, signing that she'd gone to resign from her position.

"And who brought you home? Who were you eating with?" Liam's voice sharpened with suspicion.

Olivia's hands froze mid-air. Why was Liam home at this hour? What strange twist of fate had brought him here now?

Her fingers resumed moving, explaining Natalie had driven her home after their meal together. A strange flutter tickled her chest - this was her first lie to Liam, and the deception made her palms sweat.

Then, biting her lip, Olivia signed the question burning in her mind - had he visited Evelyn? His unexpected presence demanded explanation.

To her shock, the question seemed to ignite Liam's temper. He closed the distance between them in two strides, gripping her wrist. "Bringing home leftovers? Since when do we eat takeout?"

Olivia shook her head frantically, struggling to explain. She simply hadn't felt like cooking, and the restaurant food had been too good to waste. She never imagined encountering Liam at this hour.

"Why did Natalie call me?" Liam pressed, his voice rising with each syllable.

Panic seized Olivia. She hadn't prepared for this interrogation. All she could do was gaze up at him, eyes shimmering with unshed tears and silent pleading.

Olivia's lips - still tender from last night's passionate kisses - pressed together tightly, her delicate features a portrait of wariness and beauty.

Something dark flickered in Liam's gaze. Without warning, he swept Olivia into his arms and carried her upstairs.

Liam had actually come home for lunch.

Memories surfaced of Olivia preparing elaborate meals he'd rarely stayed to eat. Finding the kitchen empty today had sparked unexpected irritation. But seeing her now, he desired something entirely different than food.

###Chapter 12

Liam swept Olivia into his arms and deposited her onto the king-sized bed. Her palms pressed weakly against his chest, the resistance more perfunctory than genuine as her fingers trembled against his shirt.

"Behave, darling," Liam whispered, his breath hot against the shell of her ear as he leaned in closer.

Olivia stiffened momentarily, but when his lips sought hers, she turned her face away. A solitary tear escaped, tracing a glistening path down her porcelain cheek. Her entire body trembled as if enduring some unseen torment rather than participating in an intimate moment.

With a frustrated sigh, Liam straightened to his full height. "You're rejecting me now?" His voice carried equal parts confusion and irritation.

Olivia hastily signed that she wasn't feeling well, her gaze fixed determinedly on the Persian rug beneath their feet.

"Unwell from resigning? Unwell yet you dined with Natalie?" Liam's voice turned razor sharp as he advanced, demanding answers.

Olivia found herself speechless. Ever since she'd mentioned divorce, Liam had become inexplicably attentive - though not in the manner she'd hoped for.

Receiving no response, Liam stormed out without another word.

Olivia assumed he'd left for good and burrowed beneath the silk duvet, seeking solace. The sudden sound of footsteps ascending the grand staircase made her heart stutter.

To her astonishment, Liam reappeared, her designer handbag dangling from his fingers.

Olivia bolted upright, ignoring the sudden dizziness as she reached desperately for her bag.

"Looking for this?" Liam tossed the bag aside and brandished her medical records like a prosecutor presenting damning evidence. "You were at Mercy Hospital this morning? Why keep this from me?"

Olivia retreated two steps before signing that it had been a minor incident, not worth troubling him.

"You're my wife." Liam advanced, backing her against the wall. "You think your health would be a bother to me?"

As realization dawned - Natalie's call must have been about Olivia's condition - his expression darkened further.

Tears welling in her eyes, Olivia frantically signed that it had been nothing serious, just a brief episode that passed quickly. She hadn't wanted to worry him over something trivial.

Liam's gaze softened imperceptibly. "From now on, you tell me everything. Understood?"

Olivia nodded vigorously.

Just as Liam seemed about to say more, his phone shattered the moment.

"Darling, aren't you at the office? We had lunch plans." Evelyn's saccharine voice filled the room.

Olivia tried to slip away, but Liam's proximity made escape impossible. She ducked her head, pretending not to hear the conversation.

"Business lunch with clients. I'll be back later," Liam lied smoothly, his eyes never leaving Olivia's trembling form before exiting.

Olivia's head snapped up in shock as the door closed behind him. Why would he lie to Evelyn? Could it possibly be... for her sake?

By the time Olivia descended the grand staircase, Liam had already vanished.

"Madam, will you be preparing dinner this evening?" Theodore inquired, offering her a crystal glass of water as she reached the foyer.

Olivia had once cooked nightly, but Liam's constant absences had extinguished that habit.

Today was different. Liam's unexpected return had kindled a spark of hope in Olivia's chest.

She nodded enthusiastically at the butler, a rare smile gracing her lips.

In the gourmet kitchen, Olivia meticulously selected premium ingredients brought by the staff. She washed, chopped, seasoned and marinated with precision, timing each dish perfectly to ensure everything would be served at ideal temperatures.

A soft smile played on her lips as she cooked. Before their marriage, she'd dreamed of such domestic moments - preparing meals for Liam with love. Reality had gradually eroded those fantasies.

As she plated the final dish, her phone buzzed with Liam's message: "Working late. Bring dinner to my office."

Olivia's hands stilled. He wanted her to come to Blackwood Enterprises? In three years of marriage, she'd never set foot in his corporate headquarters - almost as if she'd been deliberately kept away.

Without tasting a single bite, Olivia packed the meal into thermal containers. Hailing a cab, she rushed toward the towering Blackwood skyscraper.

Even as evening fell, the Blackwood Enterprises headquarters blazed with light, employees still bustling about like worker bees in a corporate hive.

The moment Olivia stepped through the glass doors, the receptionist blocked her path. "Do you have an appointment?"

Olivia quickly typed on her phone: "I'm here to see Mr. Blackwood."

"For what purpose? Scheduled meeting?" The receptionist's demeanor shifted as she took in Olivia's appearance. What began as professional courtesy twisted into something far less pleasant.

"Mr. Blackwood requested I bring him dinner," Olivia typed, hoping to clarify.

The receptionist's laughter rang out sharply.

"Miss, do you know how many women invent stories daily to see Mr. Blackwood? If you're truly delivering food, at least dress like a delivery person. And this mute act? Pathetic. What are you hiding?"
###Chapter 13

Olivia gnawed on her colorless lip, fingers twitching with the urge to respond. As she reached for her phone, the receptionist slapped a palm on the counter. "Don't waste my time. One more disturbance and I'm calling security!"

The woman shoved Olivia backward with unnecessary force. Left with no choice, Olivia texted Liam instead. "I'm in the lobby. They won't let me up."

The screen remained stubbornly blank.

Pacing the marble floor, Olivia realized her carefully prepared dishes were cooling by the minute. She approached the desk again, typing rapidly. "Could you please notify Mr. Blackwood of my arrival?"

She deliberately avoided mentioning their marital status, not wanting to cause Liam professional embarrassment.

The receptionist snorted derisively. "If we interrupted executives every time some random girl showed up claiming to know them, nothing would ever get done!"

Defeated, Olivia retreated to a plush sofa in the lobby's waiting area, resigning herself to wait until Liam finished work.

Noticing Olivia's persistence, the receptionist sauntered over with a glass of water, slamming it down with a smirk. "Mr. Blackwood uses the private executive elevator straight to the garage. You'll never catch him this way. Enjoy your pointless vigil."

Olivia kept glancing at her silent phone. Was Liam in an important meeting? Had something happened?

The elevator pinged suddenly. Liam emerged, Evelyn hanging off his arm like designer jewelry.

"Olivia?" Liam's eyebrows shot up. "What are you doing here?"

The receptionist turned sheet-white, scrambling to explain. "Mr. Blackwood, she claimed to have food for you but couldn't provide proper identification—"

"Who told you to bring food?" Liam's sharp interruption cut through the lobby.

Olivia's hands froze mid-sign. Evelyn's triumphant smirk told her everything. This had been a setup—Evelyn must have used Liam's phone to trick her into preparing his favorite dishes.

Mouth tightening, Olivia turned toward the revolving doors without explanation.

Liam's gaze tracked her unsteady movements, recalling the medical reports he'd seen—malnutrition, anemia, a body running on fumes.

"Darling," Evelyn purred, "why don't we try what the mute cooked? You always said she had... unique talents."

Before Evelyn could finish, Liam shook her off and strode after Olivia.

Evelyn's face darkened, recalling how Liam had dismissed her at the club earlier. She shot the receptionist a venomous glare. "Not a word about this to anyone!"

Outside, a sleek black Porsche pulled up to the curb.

"Olivia?" Daniel rolled down his window. "Need a ride?"

With evening traffic worsening and no taxis in sight, Olivia hesitated only briefly before sliding into the passenger seat.

Neither noticed Liam bursting through the doors in time to see the Porsche merge into traffic.

Liam's expression turned thunderous. He wrenched open the door of his Bentley Continental with enough force to alarm nearby valets.

"Liam! Wait!" Evelyn barely managed to jump in before he floored the accelerator.

The Bentley shot forward like a bullet, pinning Evelyn against the leather seats as she shrieked. Liam had never driven like this before.

Through midday traffic, the Bentley weaved dangerously, pulling alongside the Porsche. Liam laid on the horn.

Daniel, mid-conversation with Olivia, spotted Liam and immediately downshifted, surging ahead again. Like hell he'd pull over.

Olivia clutched the dashboard, eyes wide. She never imagined Liam would chase them—much less initiate this reckless high-speed pursuit.

As they raced toward the industrial district, the unfamiliar surroundings heightened Olivia's unease. Where was Daniel taking her?

But Liam refused to relent.

The confrontation came at a deserted warehouse district when Liam executed a dangerous maneuver, cutting off the Porsche and forcing Daniel to brake violently.

Tires screeched. Dust swirled.

And in that suspended moment, three lives hung in the balance.
###Chapter 14

The Mercedes screeched to a sudden halt, sending Olivia lurching forward before her seatbelt yanked her back violently. Her knuckles turned white as she gripped the door handle, her face drained of all color.

"Damn it, Olivia—I didn't mean to—" Daniel blurted out, finally noticing her terrified expression.

Olivia simply shook her head and slumped back against the seat, exhaustion written across her delicate features.

The Bentley's door swung open with force. Liam emerged first, his expression thunderous. Moments later, Evelyn stumbled out, looking as pale as Olivia. Having forgotten her seatbelt, she'd been thrown against the window repeatedly during Liam's reckless driving. Now she clutched her forehead, her usually impeccable appearance in complete disarray.

"Liam, please—let's just go home!" Evelyn called desperately as Liam stormed toward the Mercedes.

Ignoring her completely, Liam marched to the passenger side and yanked at the door handle. Finding it locked, he slammed his fist against the window with enough force to make the glass tremble.

"Olivia, don't be afraid. I won't let him hurt you," Daniel said firmly, his protective instincts kicking in.

Olivia shook her head again.

Frustrated by his inability to understand sign language, Daniel watched helplessly as Olivia typed a message on her phone: "He's my husband."

Those three words seemed to deflate Daniel completely. With a resigned sigh, he hit the unlock button. The door was immediately wrenched open by Liam, who reached in to pull Olivia out.

"What the hell are you doing, Blackwood?" Daniel demanded, grabbing Liam's arm to stop him from manhandling Olivia.

"Taking my wife home. Not that it's any of your business," Liam spat, his voice dripping with venom. His stormy eyes promised violence.

Daniel's jaw tightened. "I care about how you treat my sister's best friend."

"Exactly—my sister's friend. So stay out of it."

Despite Liam's attempts to drag Olivia toward his car, Daniel stood his ground like an immovable wall.

"Let her go. I'm not moving until I hear her say she wants to go with you," Daniel growled.

Liam's gaze snapped to Olivia. Before she could respond, he scoffed. "You should worry about yourself!"

Just then, police sirens wailed in the distance. Within moments, several squad cars surrounded both vehicles, officers pouring out.

"Reckless driving and speeding. You're coming with us," an officer announced, immediately restraining Daniel.

"He was speeding too! Why aren't you arresting him?" Daniel protested, but his resistance only earned him rougher treatment as he was forced onto the pavement.

Olivia's eyes widened in shock—Liam had called the police on Daniel. She desperately wanted to explain, but Liam gave her no chance. He practically shoved her into the Bentley's passenger seat.

After locking the doors, Liam slid behind the wheel.

"Liam? You can't just leave me here! Where even are we?" Evelyn pounded on the window in disbelief. But Liam simply sped away, leaving her standing in the middle of the road.

The nausea hit Olivia hard during the drive. The world spun violently as carsickness overwhelmed her. By the time they reached the mansion, she could barely stand.

The butler greeted them at the entrance. "Sir, Madam, you're home early. Have you dined?"

Olivia froze—she'd left the food container in Daniel's car. Shaking her head at the butler, she turned to Liam, silently asking if he wanted her to prepare something specific.

Liam, still seething, didn't respond. Instead, he swept her into his arms and pinned her to the nearest couch.

The butler discreetly vanished.

Dizziness forced Olivia's eyes shut. To Liam, it looked like she couldn't bear to look at him.

"One gesture from Daniel, and you went with him willingly," Liam accused, his voice sharp as a blade. "I asked you to come home with me, and you resisted. If I hadn't intervened, would you have married him?"

Shock flashed across Olivia's face as she met his gaze. She had rejected Daniel's proposal—had Liam been involved somehow?

Noticing her reaction, Liam let out a bitter laugh. "Just hearing his name affects you this much? Remember, Olivia, you're married to me. You belong to me—forever. Don't even think about leaving."

His large hand slid beneath her dress aggressively. Overwhelmed and unable to push him away, Olivia suddenly turned her head and vomited violently as sickness overtook her.
###Chapter 15

Liam took several steps backward, his face clouding with displeasure.

"I'm sorry," Olivia thought silently. The nausea overwhelmed her, preventing any gestures as she weakly reached for the table napkins instead.

Moments later, Liam helped Olivia sit up, carefully wiping her lips with a tissue. He handed her a glass of water with surprising tenderness. His actions reminded her of their early days together - that same gentle patience she'd fallen in love with.

After assisting her with rinsing her mouth, Olivia leaned back against the sofa cushions, keeping her eyes closed.

"Still dizzy?" Liam's deep voice cut through the quiet room.

She nodded slightly without opening her eyes.

Silence stretched between them until the sound of shuffling feet announced a servant coming to clean the mess. Liam then ordered warm milk from the butler. When it arrived, he helped Olivia drink, his fingers brushing against hers. Gradually, the dizziness faded, and she managed a small grateful smile.

Liam's expression softened as he stroked her hair, his touch feather-light. But his next words sent ice through her veins.

"Remember your place, Olivia. You're my wife. I won't tolerate you getting close to other men."

She nodded mechanically, her mind racing. He could set boundaries for her, but what about his own actions with Evelyn? What did that woman truly mean to him?

Seeming satisfied, Liam stood and left without another word.

When she finally gathered enough strength, Olivia texted Natalie. "How's Daniel? I'm so sorry. This is all because of me."

The reply came instantly. "Don't blame yourself, darling! My brother made his own choices. He'll be out soon - I'm handling everything."

Guilt twisted in Olivia's chest. Daniel had only tried to help her, and now he sat in jail because of Liam's temper.

She had to do something.

Climbing the stairs, Olivia checked the study first - empty. The sound of running water led her to their bedroom. Liam was showering. Was he planning to stay the night? What would Evelyn think about that?

Lost in thought, Olivia didn't notice when the water stopped. The bathroom door suddenly swung open, steam billowing out. Liam stood there, towel slung low on his hips, water droplets glistening on his toned chest. Heat rushed to Olivia's cheeks.

"Waiting for me?" His lips curved in that infuriating smirk.

She couldn't meet his gaze, her eyes dropping to the towel's edge instead. When he stepped forward, she instinctively retreated.

Summoning courage, Olivia signed her request about Daniel, finally looking up at Liam.

His expression darkened immediately. "What is it?"

She gestured carefully - Daniel meant no harm, she wouldn't see him again, please don't make things difficult. She knew Liam's influence. If he decided to pursue this, even Natalie couldn't protect her brother.

"Protecting him now?" Liam's voice dripped with icy sarcasm.

Olivia lowered her head, signing an apology.

"If you're truly sorry, then show me properly." Liam sat on the bed, legs spread in that commanding way she knew too well. His meaning was clear.

Cheeks burning, Olivia knew he wouldn't help unless she complied.

Taking a shaky breath, she awkwardly straddled him, hands resting lightly on his shoulders. Usually he took charge - this role reversal left her clumsy and tense, even causing herself discomfort.

"Fool," Liam muttered, pulling her close.

Olivia bit her lip hard, determined not to make a sound.

The next thing she knew, morning light streamed through the windows. She woke alone in the massive bed, Liam already gone. Had he kept his word?

Her phone showed a message from Natalie last night: "Daniel's free! You talked to Liam, didn't you? I'm sorry you had to go through that, Olivia..."

Relief flooded her. "Is he hurt?" she typed back.

"He's fine. Getting lectured by Dad now! Oh, and that dish you left? Absolutely divine! I ate every last bite!"

Olivia smiled, glad Natalie enjoyed the food she'd prepared. "I'll make something special for you again."

"How about dinner out instead? My treat?" Natalie offered.

Olivia hesitated. Liam had made his expectations clear. But she wasn't his prisoner. After a pause, she accepted.

When Natalie offered to pick her up, Olivia dressed quickly and headed downstairs. The chef was already preparing breakfast.

"Madam, will you be cooking for Mr. Blackwood today?" the butler inquired.

Olivia considered, then shook her head firmly.

Last night's tenderness had felt almost dreamlike, making her feel truly cherished as Liam's wife. But she knew better now. His pattern of hot and cold was just another way to control her, and she wouldn't play along anymore.

With decisive gestures, she informed the butler she was leaving and that the chef should handle all meals. She added emphatically that she wouldn't be cooking anymore.

###Chapter 16

Natalie arrived to collect Olivia with sparkling energy. "Darling, let's try that new golf course in the south district! I just secured us VIP passes."

Olivia had often played golf with Liam in the past. The sunny weather and Natalie's infectious excitement made her nod in agreement.

After parking, they changed into sleek golf attire and rented premium clubs before heading to the lush green course.

"Wait here, sweetie. I need to dash to the ladies' room—drank way too much iced tea this morning!" Natalie chirped before hurrying off.

Olivia strolled toward the edge of the course while waiting. With only two small groups playing, the space felt serene and private. The nearest players were mere dots in the distance. She practiced a few swings, adjusting to the club's weight.

Then, footsteps crunched behind her. Assuming it was just another golfer, she didn’t turn until they stopped right at her back.

"Who’s keeping you company, gorgeous? Don’t see anyone around," a deep voice drawled.

Olivia spun to face a towering, muscular man with a gleaming bald head and a gold-capped tooth that glinted when he smirked.

She shook her head silently, signaling she couldn’t speak.

"A mute beauty? Even more intriguing," he mused, his grin widening. Ignoring her discomfort, he grabbed her wrist and yanked her closer.

Panic surged through Olivia. A golf course was the last place she expected harassment. She tried swinging her club at him, but he overpowered her effortlessly, tossing it aside.

"Those clothes scream 'outsider.' You here with some rich sugar daddy?" he taunted. "Doesn’t matter. Stick with me, and I’ll show you a real good time."

Olivia shook her head violently. With her hands trapped, she couldn’t even sign for help. Desperate, she drove her knee into his groin.

"Ahh!" he howled, momentarily releasing her. She bolted—but he recovered fast, snatching her hair and wrenching her back.

"You’ll regret that," he snarled, tearing at her collar. "No one’s stopping me now."

Olivia fought wildly, but his strength overwhelmed her. Just as despair set in—

Thud.

A heavy impact echoed. His grip slackened.

Olivia whirled to see him clutching his bleeding head.

Liam stood there, gripping a golf club like a weapon.

Once sure she was free, Liam swung relentlessly—each strike landing with brutal precision until blood splattered the grass.

"Mr. Blackwood! Please, it was a mistake!" the man begged between blows.

Liam’s voice was arctic. "You laid hands on my woman?"

"I didn’t know she was yours! I swear—"

Olivia hugged herself, trembling but relieved.

The beating only stopped when Liam’s club snapped. He turned to Olivia, his gaze icy. "Why are you here?"

She signed frantically, explaining Natalie had brought her. She gestured urgently toward the exit, desperate to avoid drama—Liam’s disdain for Natalie was no secret.

But his expression darkened further. Was she leaving because of him?

Staff and the manager rushed over as tension thickened.

Liam jabbed the broken club at the groaning man. "If he ever steps foot here again, I’ll finish what I started."

He tossed the splintered club onto the man’s chest.

"Of course, Mr. Blackwood," the manager stammered, bowing. "His membership is revoked immediately!"

As staff dragged the man away, a shrill voice cut through.

"Liam! What’s going on—oh, it’s her." Evelyn Hartley, clad in a crimson dress, latched onto Liam’s arm.

Olivia retreated, ready to slip away.

Liam noticed, his jaw tightening. "Weren’t you here to play?" he asked, ignoring Evelyn as he closed the distance.

Olivia hesitated, then nodded. Her abandoned club and attire confirmed it.

"You used to beg me for lessons," Liam remarked coolly, plucking a fresh club from the rack.

Olivia’s pulse spiked. Was he mocking her? She’d once feigned interest in golf to spend time with him. Now, she ducked her head, pretending not to recall.

"Lucky for you, I’m free today." His tone was indifferent as he slid an arm around her waist and guided her forward.

Positioning himself behind her, Liam cradled her hands on the club, his chest flush against her back. "Lesson one," he murmured, his breath warm on her neck.

Olivia’s breath hitched.

This wasn’t a rescue.

It was a trap.
###Chapter 17

Olivia's muscles tightened as Liam's imposing figure loomed beside her. Evelyn's shrill voice sliced through the tension, while the other guests who'd arrived with Liam exchanged shocked glances. Few knew Olivia was actually Liam's wife - most assumed Evelyn held that position.

Now, as Liam adjusted her golf stance directly in front of Evelyn, Olivia braced for disaster. Her palms grew slick when Liam guided her swing, but their timing was disastrously off, sending the ball careening wildly off-course.

"Been a while since you played?" Liam's warm chuckle near her ear sent shivers down Olivia's spine, seemingly oblivious to the electric tension around them.

Olivia could only nod mutely.

"Relax, put some strength here," Liam instructed, gently correcting her posture and chin position for the next shot.

His body pressed against hers, radiating familiar warmth Olivia once craved. Now she just wanted to flee.

"Liam, I want to sit over there. Will you join me?" Evelyn's interruption shattered the moment.

"If you want to sit, go by yourself. Last I checked, you had functioning legs," Natalie snapped protectively. Having witnessed Liam's proximity to Olivia and knowing her friend's fragile hopes, Natalie's protective instincts flared.

Evelyn's face fell, her pleading eyes locked on Liam with desperate hope.

Liam remained detached, focusing solely on guiding Olivia as if they were alone.

The second swing landed significantly closer to the target.

"Good shot! Now try it alone." With that, Liam stepped back, releasing Olivia.

Natalie approached cautiously, shooting daggers at Evelyn.

Evelyn, however, seemed uninterested in competing for attention. She selected a new club and positioned herself at the course's edge.

As Olivia prepared her next shot, Evelyn took stance opposite her, determination hardening her features as she swung.

"Oops!" Suddenly Evelyn's club flew from her grasp, spiraling through the air before striking Olivia's bare arm with a sickening thud!

The impact sent Olivia sprawling. An angry red welt immediately bloomed on her exposed skin.

"Olivia!" Natalie was at her side instantly, cradling the injured arm. "Are you okay? How bad is it? Can you move your fingers?"

Pain nearly brought tears to Olivia's eyes, but she managed a weak shake of her head.

Confused by Liam's sudden affection, Olivia assumed he was only using her to provoke Evelyn. He'd never take her side against his mistress. Gritting her teeth, she struggled to her feet, assuring Natalie she was fine.

"You can't even lift your arm and you say you're fine?" Natalie's eyes blazed with fury. She whirled on Evelyn. "That was deliberate! Just wait until my family's lawyers hear about this!"

"I-I didn't mean to! Nobody taught me proper form! The club just slipped-" Evelyn's tearful explanation painted her as the victim while subtly shifting blame.

"An accident? Out of this entire course, your club just happened to hit Olivia? Well then, I suppose this is an accident too!" Natalie raised her club threateningly.

"Enough!" Liam's command cut through the confrontation.

Evelyn immediately cowered behind Liam. "Liam, I swear it was an accident-"

"Fine. Olivia must be blind to stay with a man like you!" Natalie hurled her club down in disgust before turning to help Olivia. "Let's get you to Mercy Hospital," she said gently.

Olivia's arm had swollen alarmingly - likely a fracture.

Natalie offered support as they started toward the exit, but they'd barely taken three steps when rapid footsteps approached.

Suddenly Liam swept Olivia from Natalie's grasp, carrying her swiftly off the course.
###Chapter 18

"You!" Natalie rushed forward, but Liam had already swept Olivia into his arms, moving with determined strides toward the parking lot. He carefully settled her into the passenger seat, revved the engine, and sped away before Natalie could react.

By the time Natalie reached the parking lot, Liam's luxury car had disappeared down the winding hospital driveway.

At Mercy Hospital, owned by Blackwood Enterprises, an elite team of orthopedic specialists stood ready. Moments later, Ryan appeared, his trademark smirk in place. "Got into a scuffle? Rough treatment? Man, I know you enjoy your little games, but try not to break your toys, okay?"

"Enough!" Liam's expression darkened. "Get the tests started immediately."

"Fine, what should we check? Maybe her brain? She literally stopped time before, and now she's battered but still breathing. Definitely something wrong with her head!" Despite his teasing tone, Ryan moved with professional efficiency.

Olivia visibly shrank from Ryan's presence, but the pain left her trembling uncontrollably, unable to protest.

Soon, Olivia was wheeled away for comprehensive scans, given pain medication, and treated for her injuries.

"No fractures, but severe bruising. I'm putting you in a cast anyway. Try to minimize movement," Ryan informed her while studying her X-rays.

Olivia nodded silently, examining her splinted arm with downcast eyes. Her right arm's injury meant she couldn't use sign language to communicate - her primary means of expression.

Throughout the examination, Liam remained at her side, his expression unreadable but intense.

Olivia risked a glance at him.

"Need to say something?" Liam handed Olivia her phone with her uninjured left hand.

Awkwardly unlocking it, she typed: "You can go. I don't need your help."

Reading the message, Liam's face darkened instantly. "You really can't stand having me around, can you?" His voice carried an edge of hurt. She'd tried to leave when she saw him at the golf course, and now she was dismissing him again?

"Fine! Don't bother showing your face around me then!" Liam slammed the hospital room door on his way out.

Ryan, who'd remained by Olivia's bedside, sighed. "Olivia, you're too reserved. You should stand up for yourself more."

Olivia looked at him, startled by his bluntness.

"Relationships are simple. Keep him interested, let him fall for you, then walk away. Who cares if you can't speak? Your beauty speaks volumes," Ryan stated matter-of-factly.

Olivia shook her head vigorously.

"What are you afraid of? He doesn't bite!"

Grabbing her phone, Olivia typed rapidly: "I can't. Around him, I lose all my dignity."

Ryan, surprised by her response, impulsively snapped a photo of her message with his own phone before she could react.

"Just rest," Ryan said abruptly, tucking her phone under her pillow. "Sleep. You'll feel better tomorrow."

Olivia stared in shock as Ryan exited, leaving her alone with her thoughts.

Meanwhile, Liam received Ryan's message at a high-society gala. He hadn't returned to the golf course after leaving the hospital, choosing instead to drown his thoughts in champagne and superficial conversation.

Glass in hand, Liam grew increasingly withdrawn, his mood so dark that even his usual companions kept their distance.

Only Evelyn, seated beside him, seemed oblivious to his mood, playfully requesting he peel shrimp for her.

When Liam saw the photo from Ryan, he was mid-way through peeling a shrimp.

His eyes locked onto the word "dignity." Memories surfaced of a dinner with Olivia where she'd peeled an entire plate of shrimp for him, presenting it with a shy smile. Had he appreciated that gesture?

Regretfully, Liam couldn't remember - or perhaps he'd refused to touch the food, suspecting her hands might be unclean.

"What's so interesting?" Evelyn leaned in, trying to see his screen. "Darling, I'd love some crab legs too. Could you crack them for me?"

"If you can't manage, ask a server," Liam suggested coldly, locking his phone and brushing Evelyn's hand away as he reached for his drink. The half-peeled shrimp landed in the trash.

Evelyn recoiled, her eyes burning with resentment. It had to be Olivia. Ever since Liam left her standing outside that hotel, something had shifted between them. That mute little nobody must have interfered. How dare she dream of coming between Evelyn and Liam?

Seizing a bathroom break, Evelyn made a hurried call. "She's at Mercy Hospital today, VIP floor, private room. Get someone in there immediately and deal with her!"
###Chapter 19

The sterile hospital room smelled of antiseptic as Olivia clung to Natalie, who was adjusting the sheets on the extra bed.

Olivia's fingers danced across her phone screen. "You should go home. The nurses will take care of me. It's just a dislocated shoulder. No need to babysit me."

Natalie crossed her arms stubbornly. "I'm not leaving you alone in this condition."

With a sigh, Olivia typed another message. "I think Liam might visit tonight."

That made Natalie hesitate. "Is he really trying to fix things?"

Earlier that day when Liam had taken Olivia golfing, Natalie had thought their relationship was improving. But then Evelyn had caused another scene, and Liam had not only ignored it but defended her. The betrayal still stung.

Olivia nodded firmly and typed: "Trust me. I can handle this."

"Fine..." Natalie finally relented, but not before delivering a ten-minute lecture on safety precautions.

The moment the elevator doors closed behind Natalie, doubt crept in. If Liam truly cared, wouldn't he have been here already? Maybe I'll just wait in the lobby until he shows up, she thought.

After buying snacks from the hospital gift shop, Natalie decided to use the classic "forgot my keys" excuse to return.

As she stepped off the elevator, a shadowy figure slipped into Olivia's room. With only two private suites on this floor, there was no mistaking the location. Natalie's blood ran cold. "Hey!" she shouted, her voice echoing down the corridor.

She sprinted toward the room, knowing Liam wouldn't sneak around like this. The door burst open under her kick, but she was too late.

A masked man had Olivia halfway out the window, his hand crushing her throat. Olivia's legs flailed as she struggled to maintain her grip on the windowsill.

"Freeze! Police!" Natalie screamed.

The distraction worked. In that split second of hesitation, Olivia drove her knee into the attacker's groin.

The man howled in pain but the motion sent Olivia teetering backward - sixteen stories above certain death.

Natalie lunged forward just as a blur shot past her.

Ryan moved like lightning. He grabbed Olivia's hospital gown and yanked her back inside. They crashed to the floor in a tangled heap.

"Olivia! Are you okay? Did he hurt you?" Natalie fell to her knees, tears streaming down her face.

Without a word, Ryan stood and delivered a brutal kick to the attacker's spine. The sickening crack of breaking bone filled the room as the man collapsed, paralyzed with pain.

Natalie helped Olivia back to bed just as medical staff rushed in. Dark bruises already bloomed on Olivia's neck, and her recently reset shoulder hung at an unnatural angle, tears of pain leaking from her eyes.

As the doctors worked, Natalie looked stricken. "This is my fault. If I hadn't left..."

Olivia shook her head weakly.

"That bastard's fault!" Natalie spat. She stormed over and stomped on the groaning man's hand. "Did Evelyn send you?"

At this point, Evelyn was the only one with motive.

The attacker only whimpered in response.

Meanwhile, Ryan had already called Liam.

When Liam heard about the attack, he jumped to his feet. But as he turned to leave, he caught Natalie's accusation and froze, his gaze shifting to Evelyn's carefully constructed look of concern.

"You're coming with me," Liam ordered Evelyn.

The moment they entered, Natalie let out a bitter laugh. "Here to confess?" Her glare could have melted steel. "Couldn't handle being the other woman, so you hired a hitman?"

"I... I don't know what you're talking about!" Evelyn's voice trembled as she hid behind Liam, her face draining of color.

"Oscar-worthy," Natalie sneered, holding up a phone. "One call proves you hired this scum."

She pressed a button. Seconds later, Evelyn's purse chimed.

"This is his phone," Natalie said, pointing to the unconscious attacker. "Last call received from this number. When I called it back..." She let the implication hang in the air. "Care to explain, Evelyn?"
###Chapter 20

"I— I—" Evelyn stammered, her face draining of color as fear consumed her. Her fingers trembled violently around the phone, her voice failing her completely.

Liam, shocked by her reaction, swiftly took the device from Evelyn's shaking hands and answered the call.

"Hello?" Liam's deep voice echoed through the phone Natalie held.

"You sent someone to murder Olivia!" Natalie screamed, her accusing finger pointing directly at Evelyn. "The police are already on their way! We have irrefutable proof! You planned a killing, and now you'll rot in prison!"

Natalie's glare burned into Liam with fiery intensity.

"I swear I don't know anything about this—" Evelyn's words dissolved into choked sobs, her distress radiating through the room.

"The evidence is right here, clear as daylight! What possible explanation could you have?" Natalie snapped.

At that moment, the man sprawled on the floor groaned and cried out, "I'll tell you everything! Just don't send me to jail!"

"Fine, talk. If you're honest, I might let you walk away," Natalie conceded, realizing she could use this to destroy Evelyn's reputation in Liam's eyes without police involvement. The Bennett family's influence could handle this quietly.

Tears streamed down the man's face as he confessed. "I was afraid Olivia would expose everything, so I tried to kill her. She kept demanding more money—I couldn't keep paying!"

Natalie's face froze in shock. "What did you just say? Repeat that. Unless you'd rather confess at the police station?"

"I'm telling the truth! I even recorded our last phone call. Listen for yourself!" the man insisted, his voice rising.

Natalie quickly searched his phone, finding the recent call recording. The timestamp matched Evelyn's call.

"Calm down. I'll get you another fifty thousand for Olivia. Just don't do anything reckless, understand?" Evelyn's anxious voice pleaded through the recording.

"If I pay five hundred thousand now, that woman will just demand more! How can I keep up?" The man's voice dripped with desperation.

"But she's Liam's wife! This is life and death! You can't take this lightly," Evelyn implored.

"So what? I'm at my breaking point! The confidential documents she gave me only fetched two hundred thousand, but she's blackmailing me for a million! She's threatening to tell Liam and have him kill me!" The man's despair was palpable in the recording.

"If I'm going to die by Liam's hand or be driven to death by her, I won't go down alone. Go ahead, tell Liam! See if he spares me!" With that final threat, the call ended.

"There's more proof!" the man on the floor shouted. "All of Olivia's threatening texts are on my phone. I saved every one!"

"That's impossible! Olivia would never blackmail anyone!" Natalie refused to believe it, but Liam swiftly took the phone from her hands, immediately locating Olivia's number.

"Five hundred thousand. Tonight's the deadline. Bring it to Mercy Hospital's fifteenth floor. I've already sent Natalie away."

"You have one week to deliver five hundred thousand, or I'll tell Liam about the files you stole. As his wife, he won't touch me—but he'll destroy you!"

"The last payment wasn't enough. I need another five hundred thousand."

Liam scrolled through the damning messages rapidly. At the top, a photo caught his eye—his project proposal from last month.

The document showed the edge of a distinctive gold pen in the corner—a pen Liam kept exclusively in his home study. Olivia was the only one with access.

A storm brewed in Liam's eyes as he approached Olivia's hospital bed, thrusting the phone at her. "Explain this."

Olivia's functional left hand grasped the device. As she read, her eyes widened in horror. She nearly collapsed from the bed, only saved by Natalie's quick reflexes.

"This is slander! Olivia would never do this!" Natalie cried in disbelief.

"Natalie, perhaps you never truly knew your friend," Evelyn interjected softly, her voice cutting like glass.

"Lies! This is complete fabrication!" Natalie's voice cracked with fury.

Evelyn snatched the phone back and hit redial. Immediately, Olivia's phone rang.

"As you can see," Evelyn stated coldly, "the evidence speaks for itself."

"If that's true, why cover for her? Why not expose Olivia immediately? This is a setup!" Natalie roared.

"Enough!" Liam's voice thundered through the room, silencing everyone.

His burning gaze locked onto Olivia alone.

"Did you do this?"

###Chapter 21

Tears streamed down Olivia's face in silent rivers. She desperately wanted to explain herself, but only choked whimpers escaped her trembling lips.

Her fingers shook violently as she reached for her phone. "Would you trust me if I swore it wasn't me?" she typed with unsteady hands.

Liam's stormy gaze pinned her in place, his eyes dark with betrayal. "Do you have any idea what that project meant? The sleepless nights? The sacrifices?" His voice cracked with barely contained rage. "We lost everything because of you. A hundred million gone. For what? A miserable million?"

His hand shot out, gripping her chin with bruising force. Olivia gasped as his fingers dug into her skin, cutting off her air. "Haven't I given you everything? Money, freedom, my name? Was this your plan all along? Some twisted revenge?"

Olivia shook her head frantically, tears blurring her vision. The mere thought of betraying Liam made her physically ill. She'd never touched the accounts he'd set up for her. How could he believe she'd sell him out? Yet she had entered his study that night - always careful, never disturbing anything - and now that simple act condemned her.

"It wasn't her! For God's sake, Liam, look at her! She can't breathe!" Natalie fought to pull Liam away, but he stood like an immovable mountain.

Only when Olivia's face turned an alarming shade of purple did his grip finally loosen.

The sudden sound of heavy footsteps echoed through the doorway. "Who called the authorities?"

Natalie had dialed emergency services to report the man still crumpled on the floor. She never imagined the situation would escalate like this.

"There's been a terrible mistake-" Natalie began explaining, but the man interrupted with a dramatic wail. "Olivia! Olivia blackmailed me! She gave me no choice!"

The officer's piercing gaze shifted to Olivia. "And who exactly is Olivia? What are these alleged blackmail claims?"

Recognition flashed across the officer's face when he saw Liam, making him hesitate.

"Mr. Blackwood, please! Olivia has worshipped you since she was a girl. Even as your wife, she's endured so much in silence-" Natalie's voice broke under the weight of emotion.

All eyes turned to Liam, whose expression darkened like gathering thunderclouds as he loomed over Olivia. "Anything to add to your friend's touching defense?"

Olivia wiped her tears with shaking hands and typed again. "What difference would it make? You've already decided I'm guilty."

"Exactly," Liam spat, his voice dripping with venom.

Turning to the officers with a cold smirk, Liam delivered his verdict. "She's the one who stole confidential files, costing my company a hundred million. Arrest her for questioning."

"No! Liam, stop!" Natalie's scream tore through the room as she lunged forward, only to be restrained by two officers.

"Me! Take me instead! I confess! I did it all!" Natalie thrashed against their hold. "Olivia's barely recovered from her injuries - she can't handle interrogation!"

Chaos erupted as officers moved to drag Olivia from her hospital bed.

As they hauled her up, Olivia caught Evelyn's triumphant smirk.

Their eyes met for one terrible moment - understanding flashing between them - before Olivia turned desperately to Liam. With tremendous effort, she forced her damaged vocal cords to produce a single, broken word: "Liam..."

He whirled around at the sound of his name, his furious gaze locking onto her frail form in the thin hospital gown.

Then Olivia's eyes rolled back.

Her body went limp.

She collapsed to the floor like a marionette with cut strings.
###Chapter 22

"Let her go this instant!" Liam's voice thundered across the room as Olivia collapsed onto the floor.

Liam rushed forward, catching Olivia just before she hit the ground, cradling her limp body against his chest.

"Help her!" Liam snapped at Ryan.

Without hesitation, Ryan wheeled over a medical stretcher and carefully transferred Olivia onto it. After a quick examination, he announced, "Her pulse is racing and her breathing's shallow. She's fainted from stress - nothing life-threatening."

The entire room seemed to freeze. No one moved to intervene, not even the police officers who had been moments away from arresting Olivia. Every eye was fixed on the unconscious woman.

From the edge of the crowd, Evelyn watched with clenched teeth as Liam unexpectedly swept Olivia into his arms, effectively preventing her arrest. Fury burned in her eyes. "What perfect timing for this little performance," she muttered under her breath. "Convenient fainting spell to avoid jail."

Though Evelyn spoke quietly, Natalie heard every poisonous word. Already seething with anger, Natalie lost control and slapped Evelyn hard across the face. "Say that again, I dare you!"

"You - you hit me!" Evelyn gasped.

Despite being bullied for years, Evelyn had never retaliated in front of Liam. She clutched her stinging cheek, stepping back in shock as tears welled in her eyes.

Liam remained completely focused on Olivia, oblivious to the altercation.

"And why shouldn't I?" Natalie shot back fiercely. "After what you've done to Olivia, a hundred slaps wouldn't be enough!"

Natalie raised her hand again, ready to strike.

Liam said nothing, and no one else dared intervene.

As Natalie moved to hit Evelyn again, the terrified woman turned and fled.

"Enough!" Liam's voice cracked with irritation. "Must you cause such a scene?"

"Liam, she-" Evelyn began, but was immediately cut off.

Ryan interrupted sharply. "Can't you see we're busy here? Be quiet!"

Evelyn pressed her lips together, casting a pleading look at Liam, who gave no indication he'd noticed her distress.

Meanwhile, Olivia began to stir.

"How are you feeling? Point to where it hurts if something's wrong," Ryan said gently, being the first face Olivia saw as she regained consciousness.

"Olivia, are you okay?" Natalie rushed to her side.

Olivia's wide, confused eyes found Liam's face, filled with bewilderment and fear.

"You fainted," Ryan explained.

As awareness returned, Olivia remembered the events leading to this moment. She shook her head slowly. Truthfully, she felt terrible all over, but no specific pain stood out, so she pretended everything was fine.

"Do I still have to go to the police station?" Olivia signed shakily to Ryan. "I can explain everything. I didn't do what they're accusing me of."

Ryan's face became unreadable as he glanced at Liam. His silence spoke volumes.

"Would you rather explain to the police than to me?" Liam voiced the thoughts Ryan hadn't spoken, his expression darkening.

Olivia's gaze dropped, her fingers nervously twisting the hospital sheet.

"Why won't you explain it to me? Look at me!" Liam's voice grew sharp with anger.

"You're scaring her! Do you plan to hurt her again?" Natalie interjected protectively, positioning herself between them.

Olivia raised her eyes again. Dressed in a hospital gown, her fragile frame made the purple bruises on her delicate neck stand out starkly against her pale skin.

"Just explain it to me," Liam said, moderating his tone with visible effort. "I'm listening."

"I haven't taken any money from him. Check my bank account," Olivia typed with trembling fingers, using her phone's text-to-speech function to relay her message.

"I have the transfer receipt!" the restrained man shouted desperately. "It's in my pocket! She can't deny it!"

Someone quickly retrieved the receipt. The details matched the time of the extortion messages, listing Olivia's account number.

"How do you explain this?" Liam challenged, holding the receipt before Olivia, his voice controlled but deep.

This time, Olivia showed neither panic nor fear. She typed again: "My account shows no such deposit, and I haven't contacted him. You can verify with my bank and phone records."

"Alright, contact the bank and phone company immediately to confirm this," Liam ordered.

###Chapter 23

"I swear I'm telling the truth!" The man writhing on the floor cried out as Ryan Carter loomed over him. Liam Blackwood observed silently, his face an unreadable mask.

Natalie Bennett couldn't take it anymore. She stepped forward and delivered a sharp kick to the man's ribs. His cries cut off abruptly as pain radiated through his body.

"Another sound and I'll break something more important," Natalie threatened, her voice dripping with icy menace that would make any crime boss proud.

Complete silence fell. The man clamped his lips together, terror flashing in his widened eyes.

Updates soon arrived from both the financial institution and telecommunications company. The bank confirmed the man's claims - he had indeed initiated a transfer to Olivia Sinclair as shown in the receipt. However, it was a scheduled payment that had only cleared into Olivia's account thirty minutes prior, explaining why she hadn't noticed it yet.

The phone company provided Olivia's communication records for the past month. With her inability to make calls, her log showed only missed calls from delivery services, which she'd responded to via text. There were occasional messages to the housekeeper and Natalie, but absolutely none to or from the accused man.

Forensic experts quickly uncovered the truth. The messages supposedly from Olivia on the man's device had been fabricated using a sophisticated spoofing device. It was clearly a setup designed to frame Olivia.

With her innocence proven, Olivia lifted her gaze to meet Liam's. Her eyes shimmered with silent heartbreak, dulled by the emotional ordeal.

Liam's jaw tightened, an invisible lump in his throat preventing speech.

Olivia picked up her phone, bypassing the text-to-speech function this time. Her fingers flew across the screen before she turned it toward Liam. "I would never betray you, no matter what they offered. I'd never compromise your confidential files."

The words "confidential files" held Liam's attention a moment longer before he reached out, his fingers lightly brushing a stray lock of hair from Olivia's face. "I know," he murmured, his voice unexpectedly gentle. "Tell me what you need. Let me make this right."

Olivia blinked in surprise. She studied Liam warily before typing again.

Liam waited patiently, but when he read her next message, his expression turned glacial. "Can we proceed with the divorce now? I'll sign an IOU for the twenty million. I promise to repay every cent."

"Why?" Liam's voice dropped dangerously low, his teeth clenched to avoid saying the word 'divorce' in front of others. "Is that truly what you want?"

Olivia flinched slightly but continued typing, her head bowed. "I know you don't love me, yet I remain your wife. If you can't even trust me, what future does our marriage have?"

After reading the message, Liam was overcome with silence. The hallway became unnaturally still. He lingered before Olivia, then abruptly turned on his heel and walked away without another word.

"Looks like I'm handling cleanup duty," Natalie muttered with heavy sarcasm. She directed the nurses to escort Olivia back to her room.

Authorities took the man into custody, but the question of Evelyn Hartley's involvement remained unresolved.

"Just moments ago, you were so certain of Olivia's guilt. Perhaps you were part of this elaborate scheme too. Do you plan to explain yourself to the authorities or to Mr. Blackwood?" Natalie challenged Evelyn sharply.

Evelyn, abandoned as Liam departed, took an involuntary step back, stammering, "I-I had no idea! The evidence seemed irrefutable!"

From his position on the floor, the man, still recovering from Natalie's kick, weakly interjected, "It was me...I deceived Evelyn...I just wanted to scam her out of money, so I fed her these lies. She knew nothing."

"Is that so?" Natalie asked skeptically, tilting her head at the man. "How remarkably loyal of you to protect your employer. Though you might want to polish your story - it's full of holes at the moment!"

Soon, only Olivia and Natalie remained in the room.

Natalie, still visibly shaken, grabbed the snack bag she'd purchased earlier and sat beside Olivia. "I'm not leaving your side," she declared firmly.

Olivia offered a reassuring smile and gently urged Natalie to rest.

"But what did you say to Liam earlier? I thought you two were reconciling. Then suddenly he storms in and has you dragged away without even letting you explain?" Natalie's confusion was evident.

Olivia remained silent, absorbing Natalie's words.

"If you don't want to talk about it, that's fine," Natalie continued softly. "Let's just focus on your recovery now. You need to eat well and regain your strength!"

Thanks to Ryan's exceptional medical care, Olivia's splint was removed on her second hospital day. By the fourth day, she was nearly back to normal, though faint bruises still marred her skin.

"Darling, I'm taking you to the hot springs!" Natalie announced excitedly as she collected Olivia from the hospital. "The mineral baths will improve your circulation and speed your recovery."

They headed to an exclusive new hot spring resort. But the moment they stepped into the lavish lobby, they came face-to-face with familiar figures - Evelyn Hartley and her companion, arms linked like conspirators.
###Chapter 24

"Ugh, I could detect that rancid stench from across the street. Turns out it's just some human trash!" Evelyn's companion had a tongue sharper than a razor and cruelty etched into her bones. She dramatically pinched her nose, shot Olivia and Natalie a withering glare, and rolled her eyes so hard they nearly disappeared.

"Barking bitches are common, but ones that actually speak? Now that's a novelty," Natalie fired back without hesitation. "This is an exclusive club, not some public dog park. Manager! Are you seriously allowing these gutter rats inside?"

"Who the hell are you calling gutter rats?" Evelyn's friend exploded, her face turning crimson with rage.

Natalie stood her ground, unfazed. "The shoe fits, doesn't it? Or are you too dense to understand basic English? My god, the stupidity is painful."

The club manager rushed over immediately. Elite establishments like this only catered to society's crème de la crème. The Bennett family was local aristocracy, so the manager recognized Natalie instantly. "My deepest apologies, Miss Bennett," he said, bowing slightly. "Is there anything I can do to remedy this situation?"

Natalie yanked out her platinum membership card and slapped it onto the reception desk. "I brought my best friend here for relaxation. Where's your VIP thermal spring suite? Book it immediately!"

"I want that same suite," Evelyn interjected suddenly.

"Um, miss..." The manager hesitated, not recognizing Evelyn and noting her conflict with their esteemed guest Natalie. "I'm afraid that requires prior reservation—"

"Neither has she!" Evelyn countered sharply, producing a black titanium card from her designer purse.

The manager's eyes widened in shock—he'd never seen this woman before. "My apologies, but may I inquire whose membership this is?"

"Liam's," Evelyn said with a smug smile, "Liam Blackwood."

At the mention of the Blackwood name—far more influential than the Bennetts—the manager's demeanor shifted instantly. "Of course! Right this way, madam!"

"Hold it right there!" Natalie stepped forward, blocking their path.

"I'm terribly sorry, Miss Bennett," the manager said, sweat beading on his forehead. He knew neither he nor the Bennetts could afford to cross the Blackwoods.

"But how do we know that's actually Liam's card?" Natalie challenged, eyeing Evelyn with open suspicion. "What if she stole it? Aren't you going to verify its authenticity?"

The manager wavered under Natalie's intense scrutiny.

"Accusing me of theft now?" Evelyn sneered, not waiting for the manager's response. She pulled out her phone with a flourish. "Fine. I'll call Liam right now and have him come settle this. Then we'll see who's telling the truth!"

With that, Evelyn dramatically flopped onto a lobby chaise and made the call. Meanwhile, Natalie calmly guided Olivia to sit beside her. Olivia looked anxious, tugging at Natalie's sleeve as if wanting to avoid confrontation.

"What's there to fear?" Natalie whispered confidently. "When Liam gets here, he'll take your side without question!"

Natalie's confidence wasn't unfounded. During Olivia's recent hospital stay, Liam had visited daily—sometimes bringing breakfast, sometimes dinner—his demeanor toward Olivia noticeably softer.

This had improved Natalie's opinion of him. She still held out hope that Olivia and Liam might eventually reconcile.

But Olivia remained skeptical of Liam's sudden kindness, unconvinced it signaled genuine remorse. She shook her head and typed rapidly on her phone: "He won't hold Evelyn accountable. Remember the arson incident? Evelyn walked away unscathed, didn't she?"

Indeed, Evelyn had likely orchestrated that near-fatal "accident," though no concrete evidence ever surfaced. Despite everything, Liam's relationship with Evelyn appeared unchanged. He never suspected her.

Reading Olivia's message, Natalie's face fell. She stood abruptly, pulling Olivia up with her, but Evelyn's friend was quicker.

"Oh? Running away now?" the woman taunted loudly. "Scared of what Mr. Blackwood will do when he arrives?"

"It's not certain who should be scared!" Natalie retorted, plopping back down defiantly. "We'll wait and see!"

The minutes stretched unbearably until Liam finally arrived. Despite being in the middle of critical negotiations, he'd dropped everything at Evelyn's summons and rushed over immediately.

Seeing Liam stride through the doors sent a sharp pang through Olivia's chest. The man she loved remained at another woman's beck and call...

"Liam!" Evelyn squealed, rushing to him like an excited puppy.

"Mr. Blackwood!" Evelyn's friend gushed, practically curtsying in his presence.

But Liam's expression darkened the moment his gaze landed on Olivia across the room. "What are you doing here?" he demanded, his voice laced with icy disapproval.
###Chapter 25

Olivia stood frozen, her emerald eyes widening in shock as she stared at Liam.

"Olivia was just discharged from Mercy Hospital today. We thought a spa treatment would help her recover." Natalie rose gracefully, her gaze sharpening with protective fury. "I didn't expect to encounter homewreckers here!"

"Mr. Blackwood, that's not what happened!" Evelyn's friend countered immediately. "She attacked us first with her judgmental looks the moment she walked in!"

Liam ignored them all, striding directly toward Olivia. "Why were you discharged today?" His voice carried an edge.

Olivia gestured quickly, explaining that Dr. Carter had cleared her for discharge since her recovery progressed faster than expected.

"If you're well enough to leave the hospital," Liam's grip tightened around her wrist, "why come here instead of going home? You're coming with me."

The salon fell into stunned silence. No one anticipated Liam's reaction - least of all Olivia, who after a moment's hesitation, instinctively glanced toward Natalie for guidance.

"Go ahead," Natalie said smoothly, shooting Evelyn a triumphant look. "We can reschedule our spa day. You should rest first." Her words landed like a perfectly timed counterstrike.

With a mocking smile at Evelyn, Natalie added, "Enjoy your spa treatment! That mineral pool might help wash away that cheap perfume you're drowning in."

Evelyn's nails dug crescent moons into her palms, but she maintained perfect composure for Liam's benefit. "Liam..." Her voice quivered with carefully calculated vulnerability.

"Have fun with your friend." Liam dismissed her curtly while leading Olivia away, though he softened the blow with, "We'll talk tonight."

As Liam guided her into the waiting car, Olivia's pulse quickened. This marked their first private moment in weeks.

Silence stretched between them as the cityscape blurred past Olivia's window, gradually transforming into unfamiliar upscale neighborhoods. The car finally stopped before an imposing neoclassical building.

Confused, Olivia turned questioning eyes toward Liam.

"Let's go." Liam opened her door, his voice icy. "If you're well enough for spas, you're certainly fit for a gala."

Inside, the space resembled an elite designer atelier more than a typical salon. Couture gowns cascaded from crystal displays while makeup artists worked their magic under golden lighting. The air hummed with activity and the mingled scents of luxury cosmetics.

Though familiar with such establishments, Olivia had never visited one with Liam. The overpowering floral notes nearly triggered a sneeze, which she barely suppressed.

"Enhance her natural features and conceal any remaining bruises," Liam instructed an approaching stylist.

"Of course! With bone structure like hers, any style would be perfection. It's simply a matter of preference," the stylist gushed genuinely.

This wasn't mere flattery. The stylist rarely encountered such effortless beauty - most clients required extensive makeup to achieve what Olivia possessed naturally. Her porcelain skin needed minimal enhancement, her features so perfectly proportioned they seemed sculpted by Renaissance masters. Even standing still, Olivia carried herself with the innate elegance of a prima ballerina.

"This way, please." The stylist gestured gracefully.

Olivia moved to follow but hesitated, casting one last uncertain glance at Liam. His expression held the satisfied gleam of someone appraising a valuable acquisition rather than showing actual affection.

The last time Olivia wore an exquisite gown for a public event - aside from her wedding - had been at Henry Winslow's birthday gala during her teens. Back then, Olivia wasn't just Liam's cherished companion.

She'd been the most favored adopted daughter of the Blackwood family. Guests had flocked to compliment her, calling her blessed. No one would have dared call her mute.

Tragically, that gala marked Olivia's final public appearance. After their marriage, Liam had kept her carefully sequestered.

"Miss, which gown speaks to you?" The stylist's question pulled Olivia from her memories.

Before her stretched racks of breathtaking couture. Each creation seemed more magnificent than the last, but Olivia dared not linger, fearing Liam's impatience. She quickly selected an ice-blue gown - the same hue she'd worn to that fateful gala years ago.

"Excellent choice! This features an open back design. Shall we style your hair up?" the stylist suggested.

Only then did Olivia notice the daring cutout. She shook her head vehemently, preferring her hair down.

"Of course. If you prefer subtlety, that works beautifully," the stylist assured, guiding Olivia to the dressing room.

Once transformed, Olivia barely recognized the vision in the mirror. The stylist had accentuated her features to ethereal perfection. For a breathless moment, Olivia marveled at her reflection - she'd forgotten she could look this radiant.

"Stunning." Liam's voice shattered the moment.

Olivia startled, realizing Liam had materialized behind her. Their eyes met in the mirror's reflection, and against her better judgment, hope flickered in Olivia's chest.

Liam's gaze swept over her with clinical appreciation, like a collector examining a rare porcelain doll. His admiration held no warmth.

The familiar ache of disappointment settled in Olivia's chest. Still, compelled by fragile hope, she signed hesitantly: "Am I just...arm candy tonight?"

Liam's chuckle carried cruel amusement. "What else could you possibly be?"

Olivia longed to say she wanted to stand beside him as his wife, to support his ambitions. But her ruined voice condemned her to silence. She could never be the society wife he needed.

Head bowed in resignation, Olivia asked nothing more.

Soon after, Liam escorted her to the gala. The ballroom glittered with crystal and candlelight, every detail screaming opulence. As the guest of honor, Liam naturally drew all eyes - but within moments, the crowd's attention shifted entirely to Olivia.

A collective gasp rippled through the room.

"She's exquisite..."
"Is that Mr. Blackwood's woman? Some European starlet?"
"I've never seen her before - perhaps that mysterious heiress from Montecarlo?"

Among the crowd, Evelyn - having rushed to the gala upon hearing of Liam's attendance - stood frozen in shock. Her face paled as she registered Olivia standing proudly beside Liam, looking every inch the aristocratic wife Evelyn had dreamed of becoming.
###Chapter 26

Olivia's breath caught when she spotted Evelyn across the crowded ballroom. Liam's earlier words echoed in her mind - he'd asked Evelyn to postpone their conversation until tonight. Now, with nightfall and Liam's attention clearly divided, Olivia wondered if this was all an elaborate scheme to humiliate her.

But retreat wasn't an option. Liam's strong arm encircled her waist possessively, his gaze sweeping past Evelyn as if she didn't exist. He guided Olivia forward with effortless confidence until they were swallowed by a circle of well-wishers, pushing Evelyn out of sight.

Olivia's eyes darted around, searching for Evelyn's familiar silhouette, until Liam's fingers dug into her side in warning. She snapped her attention forward immediately.

"Mrs. Blackwood, you're even more breathtaking in person. Benjamin Wright - I've worked with your husband for years." A distinguished gentleman extended his hand with a warm smile.

Olivia offered a polite nod and gestured in greeting.

"My wife's vocal cords were damaged in an accident. Please excuse her," Liam interjected smoothly, his voice carrying just the right note of regret.

"Oh, what a shame. She's absolutely radiant," Benjamin murmured, his eyes lingering on Olivia before turning to Liam. "Your devotion to your wife is truly remarkable, Mr. Blackwood. Staying faithful through such adversity is commendable."

Liam chuckled darkly, exchanging pleasantries while Olivia forced a smile. The bitter irony twisted in her chest - she only remained by Liam's side because he hadn't discarded her yet.

Anyone could see she didn't belong here. Not like Evelyn Hartley, whose beauty matched her prestigious lineage. With marriage discussions between the Hartleys and Blackwoods already underway, and Evelyn's effortless social grace, she was clearly the more suitable match.

Olivia wished the marble floor would swallow her whole. Then Liam's warm breath brushed her ear as he whispered, "Dance with me."

Her eyes widened in shock as she turned to face him.

Without explanation, Liam captured her hand and led her to the sunken dance floor at the center of the grand hall. Couples parted like the Red Sea as they approached, whispers following in their wake.

"Is Mr. Blackwood really dancing with his mute wife?"

"Can she even hear the music?"

Olivia's palm grew damp in Liam's grip as the murmurs reached her ears.

"Relax," Liam murmured, his arm tightening around her waist. "Just follow my lead."

As the music swelled, Olivia trembled against him, determined not to embarrass Liam. Her childhood dance lessons surfaced through the fog of years, her movements growing more confident with each step. Liam moved with practiced ease, making her wonder how often he'd danced with Evelyn in this very spot.

"Liam!" The emotional cry shattered Olivia's concentration.

Evelyn stood at the edge of the dance floor, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. Olivia tried to pull away, mouthing "Go to her," but Liam's grip turned vice-like.

"You're my wife," he hissed, his tender expression belying the steel in his voice. "Stop acting like a frightened mouse. It reflects poorly on me."

Taking a shuddering breath, Olivia closed her eyes. For one fleeting moment, she imagined herself back as the beloved adopted daughter of the Blackwood family, dancing with the brother who'd once adored her.

Throwing her head back, Olivia let her hair cascade down her bare shoulders, revealing the elegant lines of her back. The crowd's murmurs shifted from pity to admiration.

"Stunning - she lives up to her reputation completely."

"That kind of grace can't be taught. It's bred into noble blood."

"None of these society girls compare. Not even that Hartley girl who's practically engaged to a Blackwood."

Evelyn's fingers clenched around her champagne flute at the whispers. Not compare? Forcing a brittle smile, she retreated to a shadowed corner and pulled out her phone, dialing with trembling fingers...
###Chapter 27

Breathless from the dance, Olivia Sinclair felt electric energy coursing through her veins. Liam Blackwood guided her away from the pulsating dance floor, her cheeks flushed with exhilaration. The genuine smile lighting up Olivia's face revealed glimpses of her former vibrant self reawakening.

Turning to Liam, Olivia gestured subtly, suggesting he should attend to Evelyn since she might be growing restless. Liam studied her with an intense, lingering gaze. "Wait here," he commanded, his voice velvet-wrapped steel.

Olivia nodded obediently, her eyes tracking his broad shoulders as he disappeared into the sea of guests. She accepted a crystal flute of champagne from a passing server, an unexpected pang of loneliness striking her as she watched him vanish into the crowd.

This unexpected moment at Liam's side felt surreal, especially after their marriage had erected such impenetrable walls between them.

Would her younger self have been crushed by disappointment had she known how this union would erode her confidence?

A light touch on her forearm shattered Olivia's reverie.

"Good evening, I'm Dominic Pierce," a charming gentleman introduced himself with impeccable manners. There was something vaguely familiar about him. "I've collaborated with Mr. Blackwood before, but this is our first encounter. Might I have this dance?"

Dominic extended his hand in clear invitation.

Olivia's eyes widened in surprise at another man's request to dance. A flicker of concern about Liam's reaction crossed her mind. But since this gentleman appeared to be one of Liam's associates, she reasoned it would be acceptable.

The infectious rhythm of the music called to her, and she'd observed numerous partner changes throughout the evening. With a small nod, Olivia placed her delicate hand in Dominic's waiting palm.

Across the grand ballroom, Evelyn Hartley advanced toward Liam with predatory grace. "You're humiliating me publicly again," she purred. "How do you intend to compensate me this time?"

"Name your price," Liam responded dismissively, as though financial solutions could mend emotional wounds.

"Why did you come?" he questioned sharply.

Evelyn's flawless features tightened momentarily before she snapped, "Weren't you the one who demanded my presence tonight? Imagine my surprise finding you waltzing with that silent doll! You even personally escorted her for hairstyling and dress selection while ignoring me!"

Without regard for spectators, Evelyn entwined herself around Liam's arm and steered him toward the dance floor. Suddenly, she gasped theatrically, covering her ruby lips. "Good heavens! Is that mute creature dancing with another man?"

Liam's expression darkened like gathering storm clouds as he witnessed Dominic guiding Olivia across the marble floor with refined elegance, her face radiant with rare happiness. Though maintaining respectable distance, Dominic's hands remained perfectly proper, showing no inappropriate intentions.

After a tense moment, Liam stalked toward them with lethal purpose. Watching his abrupt departure, Evelyn's manicured nails dug into her palms, her beautiful face twisting with fury.

She hissed under her breath, "Dominic, you spineless coward! Too frightened of Liam's fists to even touch Olivia properly!"

As the music crescendoed, Olivia moved with increasing abandon, her smile widening. This fleeting joy felt foreign after years of isolation. Without warning, an iron grip seized her wrist, wrenching her from Dominic's hold. She stumbled against a rock-hard chest.

Looking up, Olivia found herself staring into Liam's smoldering eyes, her pulse stuttering wildly.

"My apologies, Mr. Blackwood," Dominic stammered, bowing slightly with nervous deference. "I assumed the lady wished to dance. I meant no offense."

Olivia's breath caught as she glimpsed Evelyn's triumphant smirk from the periphery. A chilling realization dawned - had this entire encounter been orchestrated?

"Didn't I explicitly tell you to stay put?" Liam growled, crushing Olivia against him. His whisper carried venomous fury. "Couldn't you control yourself for five minutes? Is this your first social event?"

"Perhaps the poor mute grew overstimulated by all these people," Evelyn cooed nearby, her mocking tone dripping false sympathy. "After being locked away so long, she's forgotten how to behave."

Liam dismissed Dominic with a glare, and the man hastily melted into the crowd.

"Don't leave my sight again." Liam's command left no room for defiance. Olivia's smile died instantly. She was Liam's wife, yet confined to their gilded cage with no purpose. Why couldn't she simply exist as herself? Was her voicelessness truly such a crime?

Liam dragged Olivia to a secluded alcove where no one dared approach. Yet within moments, he became surrounded by sycophants, with Evelyn positioned at his side like his rightful partner.

Olivia observed them blankly, again questioning why Liam refused to end their farce of a marriage.

"Jealous, darling?" Evelyn's saccharine voice sliced through Olivia's thoughts.

The blonde had materialized beside her, holding two glasses of blood-red wine. With a feline smile, she offered one to Olivia.

Though Olivia accepted automatically, she didn't drink. Evelyn seemed unbothered as she sipped her wine. "You must realize," she murmured, "that while you wear his ring, you'll never hold his heart." Her smile turned knife-sharp. "He only reclaimed you because another man's hands on you wounded his pride."

Had Natalie been present, she would have reminded Evelyn that Liam had chosen to bring Olivia tonight. But Natalie wasn't here, and since Evelyn didn't understand sign language, Olivia saw no point in responding.

Suddenly, Evelyn leaned in alarmingly close. Before Olivia could react, the blonde had seized her wine-holding hand.

Olivia instinctively stepped back, but Evelyn yanked sharply, sending dark wine cascading over Evelyn's pristine white gown.

"Oh!" Evelyn shrieked dramatically, recoiling as if struck. The spreading stain resembled blood. "I only came to greet you, and this is how you respond!"

Her shrill accusation sliced through the ballroom's buzz, instantly drawing every eye in their direction.
###Chapter 28

Olivia stood frozen in the center of the chaos, her fingers trembling around an empty champagne flute. The weight of accusing stares pressed against her like a physical force. She searched desperately for words that might dissolve the tension, but only managed a helpless shake of her head.

Liam cut through the crowd with effortless authority, his broad shoulders parting guests like a ship through waves. Without hesitation, he shrugged off his tuxedo jacket and draped it around Evelyn's shoulders - a silent declaration of allegiance that made Olivia's stomach twist.

Her eyes followed Liam's every movement, brimming with silent pleas for understanding.

But when their gazes finally met, Liam's expression remained as unreadable as polished marble. He dismissed Olivia with a single glance before turning his full attention to Evelyn.

"Are you hurt?" His voice carried intimate concern that stung Olivia's ears.

Evelyn clutched at Liam's arm dramatically. "My ankle's throbbing, my dress is ruined, and I'm absolutely humiliated. I don't think I can walk..."

A hush fell over the gathered guests, though their whispers slithered through the silence like snakes. Olivia caught fragments that pierced deeper than any blade.

"That mute wife of his is more dangerous than she looks. Who knew such venom hid behind those pretty eyes?"

"Mr. Blackwood plays the game well - respectable marriage for appearances while keeping his real companion close."

"Pathetic, really. With all their wealth, you'd think she'd have more dignity than this petty jealousy."

Each word carved deeper into Olivia's composure. She longed to scream the truth - that she'd offered Liam divorce papers weeks ago. That Evelyn had orchestrated this entire scene.

Yet somehow, she'd become the villain in their narrative.

Liam's stormy gaze locked with Olivia's one final time, a silent tempest passing between them. Then, without a word, he swept Evelyn into his arms and turned away, his rejection as final as a slamming door.

The crowd parted like the Red Sea before them. As Evelyn nestled against Liam's chest, she turned her head just enough to meet Olivia's eyes.

To the room, she appeared the picture of wounded fragility. But Olivia alone saw the triumphant gleam in Evelyn's gaze - the smug victory of a predator claiming its prey.

With their departure, Olivia could finally breathe. She wove through the lingering guests, their speculative stares burning against her skin, until she burst into the cool night air.

Freedom never tasted sweeter. She gulped down deep breaths, letting the breeze soothe her frayed nerves.

Reality quickly intruded. Liam had been her ride, and now he'd left with Evelyn. Stranded in an evening gown with no purse or phone, her options were limited.

Just as panic began to set in, sleek black headlights glided to a stop before her. The driver's door opened to reveal Daniel.

"Olivia? What are you doing out here alone?"

His warm smile felt like salvation. "Let me take you home."

Daniel held the passenger door with gentlemanly grace. Olivia hesitated only a moment before sliding into the butter-soft leather seats. Meeting Daniel tonight felt like divine intervention.

Once settled, Olivia pulled out her phone and typed: "What brings you here?"

Daniel glanced at the screen before focusing on the road. "Friend's event. Left early. Figured I'd offer you a ride." His casual tone didn't quite match the tension in his knuckles on the steering wheel.

The truth was simpler - Daniel had seen the social media frenzy about Liam Blackwood's mute wife making a rare public appearance. When Olivia's name surfaced in the group chat, he'd come immediately.

"Thank you," Olivia typed, her gratitude sincere.

"Been learning sign language," Daniel announced suddenly, demonstrating a few clumsy gestures. "Getting better every day. Soon we won't need this." He tapped her phone screen playfully.

Olivia's lips curved in the first genuine smile all evening. Daniel's heart stuttered at the sight.

"Where to? Natalie's place?" he asked.

Olivia shook her head and showed him the address of the Blackwood estate. Even when Liam failed in his vows, she would keep hers.

Daniel's jaw tightened almost imperceptibly as he entered the coordinates. The remainder of the drive passed in comfortable silence until the imposing iron gates came into view.

The butler emerged, surprise flickering across his features. "Mrs. Blackwood! We weren't expecting—"

"She's with me," Daniel cut in, exiting the vehicle before Olivia could protest. She watched, bewildered, as he approached the staff.

"I heard about tonight's events. How Liam abandoned his wife to run off with Evelyn Hartley." Daniel's voice carried deliberate accusation.

Olivia's breath caught. He'd known all along.

The butler stiffened under Daniel's scrutiny.

"If Liam can't appreciate what he has," Daniel continued, voice dropping dangerously, "perhaps he should set her free. There are plenty who would value her properly."

Olivia rushed forward, grasping Daniel's sleeve in warning. The last time these two men clashed, Daniel had spent the night in jail. Provoking Liam on his own doorstep was madness.

"Message received, Mr. Bennett," the butler replied evenly.

Daniel turned to leave, but not before calling over his shoulder: "If you need anything - anything at all - you know where to find me."

Olivia's pulse hammered as she typed frantically: "Please don't mention this to Liam. Daniel was just being kind. He'd been drinking and didn't mean—"

Her fingers stilled as she realized the implication. She cursed her clumsy excuse.

The butler cleared his throat uncomfortably. "Madam..."

Before he could continue, a shadow moved in the doorway. Liam stood framed in the entrance, his expression thunderous.

"Why are you defending him?" The question cracked through the night like a whip.
###Chapter 29

Olivia froze when she saw Liam standing in the foyer, her breath catching in her throat. What was he doing here? Shouldn't he be comforting Evelyn after her dramatic scene last night?

After that spectacle Evelyn had created at the party, Olivia had assumed Liam would be glued to her side for days. Yet here he stood, back at their penthouse before midnight.

"Did Daniel bring you home?" Liam's voice cut through the silence, sharp as a blade.

She shook her head quickly, explaining how she'd been stranded without taxis when Daniel happened to drive by. The words tumbled out before she could stop them.

Olivia bit her lip. Her explanation made it sound like she was blaming Liam for abandoning her. She needed to clarify about the wine incident too. "I didn't spill the Merlot," she blurted.

She wanted to say it was Evelyn who'd knocked over the glass, but halfway through raising her hands to demonstrate, Olivia let them drop. What was the point? Liam had made his choice clear when he walked out with Evelyn. No explanation would change that.

The silence stretched between them until Liam turned abruptly to the butler. "Send for Theodore. From now on, he'll be my wife's personal driver."

Olivia could only nod stiffly at this unexpected arrangement. As she retreated upstairs, she heard the roar of Liam's sports car peeling away from the curb.

Sleep eluded her that night. When morning came, her phone buzzed with a message from Natalie. "Darling, let's have some fun today!"

Clearly Daniel had told Natalie about last night's events, though Olivia hadn't mentioned it herself.

A small smile tugged at Olivia's lips as she typed her reply. "Where did you have in mind?"

With Evelyn likely clinging to Liam today, Olivia doubted he'd have time to notice her absence.

Natalie's next message made Olivia's pulse quicken. "Gregory Thornton's studio is taking apprentices. You'd be perfect. Want to try?"

Olivia's fingers trembled against her phone screen. She hadn't thought about Gregory in years.

The renowned antiquities restorer and old friend of Henry Winslow had recognized Olivia's talent during a visit years ago. He'd handed her some delicate tools just to see what she'd do.

To everyone's astonishment, Olivia's hands proved remarkably steady - perfect for meticulous restoration work. Gregory had eagerly mentored her in his studio, where she'd shown exceptional promise.

But after Henry's passing and her marriage to Liam, Olivia had drifted away from that world, losing contact with Gregory.

She never expected Natalie to offer this opportunity.

Excitement warred with apprehension as she typed: "Liam won't approve. He's against me working."

Natalie's reply came instantly. "This isn't work! It's occasional learning. Even if you take on restoration projects, it's barely part-time."

Olivia considered this. The studio's flexible schedule would allow her to be home whenever Liam needed her cooking. His visits were infrequent anyway - sometimes disappearing for weeks.

"Alright, I'm in!" Olivia replied with newfound determination. This was more than just a hobby - it could be financially rewarding.

Unlike her bookstore job, restoring artifacts and ancient texts could lead to projects worth hundreds of thousands. This might actually help her save the twenty million Liam demanded.

Though divorce still seemed distant, for the first time in years, Olivia felt a flicker of hope.
###Chapter 30

Olivia asked Theodore to drive her to the meeting place she'd arranged with Natalie.

"My dear, I've contacted Gregory Thornton and he's thrilled about your visit!" Natalie greeted Olivia with a beaming smile the moment they met.

Olivia smiled back, her mind drifting to the joyful days spent in Gregory's studio. Ever since her vocal cords were damaged, Olivia had always felt inadequate. Though she was the adopted daughter of the prestigious Blackwood family and received respect due to her status, deep down she considered herself worthless.

Yet it was in Gregory's studio that Olivia rediscovered her self-worth. There, she realized her capabilities and understood she was far from useless. The thought of returning filled her with genuine excitement.

Natalie soon led Olivia to the studio's location.

Situated by the lake in Newport's city center, the studio occupied a prime spot, its elegant architecture blending seamlessly with the surroundings. Olivia was astonished by the transformation, marveling at how Gregory had enhanced the space so quickly.

"You wouldn't believe how lucrative artifact restoration has become," Natalie explained. "Every collector's family is wealthy these days. Gregory is currently the top expert in this field. Working with him will open incredible opportunities for you!" Natalie knew Olivia had always refused to use Liam's money.

Olivia nodded gratefully, expressing her thanks through gestures.

"Why thank me? I just want to see you happy!" Natalie responded warmly, her sincerity shining through.

After dropping Olivia at the studio entrance, Natalie drove away.

Pushing open the door, Olivia spotted Gregory deeply engrossed in his work. She lingered at the threshold until he finally looked up and noticed her.

Gregory wasn't particularly tall, with thinning gray hair and glasses that magnified his expressive eyes. His face could shift from stern concentration to warm affection in an instant. When he smiled at Olivia, it reminded her of how Henry Winslow used to look at her.

Gregory's face lit up at Olivia's arrival, his hands moving excitedly in greeting.

Unlike Olivia, whose voice was damaged later in life, Gregory had been born deaf. He often said his silence allowed him to dive deeper into his creative world.

Returning his smile, Olivia approached and extended her hand in greeting while signing hello.

Gregory regarded her with appreciation before signing that Natalie had told him about Olivia's situation. He expressed his willingness to mentor her in restoration techniques whenever she needed guidance.

Olivia nodded eagerly, her smile widening with gratitude. Just the opportunity to learn from Gregory again made her heart race with excitement.

Gregory grinned, pleased with her response. In all his years, Olivia remained the most talented restorer he'd ever encountered.

He then guided Olivia upstairs where several other apprentices were working. Their reactions to seeing her varied greatly.

Gregory produced a compact device that converted his typed words into speech. "Let me introduce Olivia Sinclair, my former apprentice from years ago."

The other apprentices' expressions softened when they realized Olivia couldn't speak, their gazes turning sympathetic.

Gregory continued, expressing his desire for Olivia to resume her studies at the studio. He praised her exceptional talent and hoped she'd readjust quickly.

Just then, among the gathered apprentices, a tall, slender young man abruptly stood. "Exceptional talent? What sort of talent does she have?"

Marcus Whitmore eyed Olivia with open skepticism, mouthing his offensive words carefully. "My grandfather was the finest restorer in the south - he even defeated Gregory in competition. And you call her talented? Ridiculous!"

He angled his body slightly, ensuring Gregory couldn't see his lips moving.

Unaware of Marcus's challenge, Gregory proceeded with introductions. Marcus was currently the most skilled apprentice in the studio.

Olivia offered Marcus a polite smile and signed a greeting. Though she tried to maintain friendliness, Marcus showed no interest in reciprocating.

Ignoring Olivia's gestures, Marcus turned to Gregory and signed his confusion about why Olivia should skip the entrance tests. Every other apprentice had to prove themselves first - why should she be any different? The unfairness of it burned in his chest.
###Chapter 31

Gregory Thornton's face was set in hard lines as he signed sharply to Marcus Whitmore, bypassing the need for typed words. His gestures emphasized that Olivia Sinclair had proven her exceptional talent long before Marcus entered the field - impressive enough that he'd taken her as his apprentice immediately.

Marcus scoffed, tilting his chin upward with arrogant disbelief. His hands moved dismissively, arguing that no one present except Gregory had witnessed Olivia's supposed skills. Even if she'd shown promise years ago, that didn't guarantee her current abilities.

With a contemptuous glance at Olivia, Marcus added that her marital status would inevitably divide her attention between restoration work and domestic duties, compromising her professional performance.

Olivia stiffened. She hadn't anticipated Marcus knowing about her marriage to Liam Blackwood, let alone commenting on it. Studying Marcus's deceptively simple black coat - undoubtedly custom-tailored like Liam's - she realized he moved in the same elite circles. Yesterday's events must have spread through their social network, though she wondered how much Marcus truly knew.

Composing herself, Olivia gestured for Gregory to remain calm before turning to Marcus. Her hands moved decisively - she would accept any test, and leave if she failed.

"Perfect!" Marcus's eyes gleamed with satisfaction.

He strode to a nearby table, returning with a large tray filled with what appeared to be fine powder. Closer inspection revealed countless minuscule fragments of a shattered vase.

"Restore this. Twenty minutes. Completing any section counts as passing." Marcus thrust several photographs at her. "Original appearance and current progress."

Though contemporary, the vase had been artificially aged. The studio team had assembled about one-third within the time limit, each person working on different sections - some the body, others the base.

Olivia nodded without hesitation. She'd faced greater challenges during her first childhood meeting with Gregory. This didn't intimidate her.

As she took her designated seat and pulled on gloves, Marcus smirked. "Timer starts now." He pressed start without allowing her preparation time.

"Shouldn't she get observation time first?" A petite girl with bangs murmured from the corner, but Marcus ignored her completely.

Unfazed, Olivia picked up tweezers and began working methodically, showing no rush despite the unfair start.

"Humph! Youth today think they know everything!" Gregory's text-to-speech device blared, his irritation clear.

"Care to wager? She'll fail. Haven't you heard? She vanished from public life after marriage. Finished!" Marcus's voice dropped to a stage whisper still audible to Olivia.

Worse followed. "Her husband's cheating. And our precious Olivia? Too frightened to confront him, hiding at home. Think she has what it takes? She'll disgrace us all!"

Olivia's fingers froze. So this was her reputation - not Liam's devoted wife, but a washed-up coward. It hadn't always been this way. How had she let this happen?

"I don't deal in gossip. If Olivia's skilled, she belongs here!" Gregory's synthesized voice rang out as he typed furiously.

Olivia steadied herself, refusing to let their words affect her. She located the first needed fragment and began restoration with precise movements.

Silence fell. Every eye in the studio fixed on Olivia's steady hands as she worked with meticulous care.

###Chapter 32

Olivia's fingers moved with effortless grace - long, slender digits that seemed to dance even at rest. Now, as she carefully manipulated the fragments of a crimson vase with precision tweezers, the vibrant shards made her delicate hands appear even more striking.

At first, the gathered crowd focused on the antique Olivia was painstakingly reconstructing. But soon, all eyes drifted to her elegant movements. The attention didn't faze Olivia in the slightest. Though initially nervous, her deep passion for restoration quickly consumed her, creating an impenetrable bubble of concentration around her.

This wasn't merely assembling a puzzle - it was an intricate dance of historical preservation. Olivia's systematic approach to sorting and categorizing each ceramic fragment was nothing short of mesmerizing.

Her speed and accuracy left the spectators, including Marcus - who had been openly skeptical moments before - utterly speechless. His doubtful expression transformed into undisguised awe as Olivia worked.

When the timer marked twenty minutes, Olivia had already reconstructed half the vase. The completed sections - the sturdy base and structural framework - clearly revealed the vessel's original silhouette. At this rate, she might finish the entire restoration well before the next twenty minutes elapsed.

"How is this possible?" Marcus finally blurted out, unable to contain his amazement.

Rising gracefully, Olivia offered him a warm smile before explaining through sign language that having a reference photograph made the task significantly easier. Unlike authentic artifact restoration where one must carefully deduce the original design through painstaking research, this challenge had been simplified by the provided image.

When Olivia finished her explanation, the room fell into profound silence. The other apprentices suddenly realized how much they'd struggled despite having the same reference photo. Their progress seemed embarrassingly slow compared to Olivia's effortless work. What had been a grueling test for them appeared as simple as child's play to her.

"Now you've all witnessed her skill firsthand!" Gregory typed eagerly on his phone before displaying the message to the group, his pride evident.

Beaming, Gregory continued through his text-to-speech function, "The puzzles she solved as a child were far more complex than this! I told you she was extraordinary. You simply wouldn't believe me. Marcus, wasn't there some wager you mentioned earlier? What say you now?"

Marcus's cheeks burned crimson with embarrassment. He silently thanked his lucky stars he hadn't actually placed any bets - that would have been truly humiliating.

To his credit, Marcus wasn't one to nurse wounded pride. He bowed respectfully to Olivia and offered a sincere apology through sign language, his gestures fluid with genuine remorse.

Olivia appeared genuinely surprised by the gesture, quickly signing back that she took no offense.

This marked the first time someone had actually apologized after doubting Olivia's abilities. Typically, even after proving herself, people would simply justify their initial skepticism rather than admit their mistake.

"Alright everyone, let's officially welcome Olivia to our studio!" Gregory's phone announced cheerfully.

The group erupted in applause - all except one girl lurking in the corner, who discreetly snapped Olivia's photo and sent it to a private chat. "Guess who just showed up?" she typed with a smirk.

"For now, we all have ongoing restoration projects," Marcus explained as he guided Olivia to her new workspace, "but Gregory mentioned we shouldn't assign you anything immediately. He wants you to settle in first."

Her station by the second-floor window offered a breathtaking view of flowering cherry blossoms against a crystal blue sky - scenery guaranteed to inspire creativity.

Olivia gestured that she might not be able to come daily.

"That's perfectly fine," Marcus reassured her. "We maintain flexible hours here. Come when there's work or whenever inspiration strikes." He added her to the studio's group chat. "If you need anything at all, just message here. We're all happy to help."

Olivia's grateful smile spoke volumes as she signed her thanks.

After organizing her workspace, Olivia began testing various tools, familiarizing herself with their weight and balance.

Suddenly, the chime of the front door echoed from below.

Marcus hurried to answer it. As Olivia examined a set of delicate brushes, an all-too-familiar voice floated upstairs. "I have an item requiring restoration. I understand you have a new conservator. I'd like her to handle this personally."

That voice belonged to Victoria Clarke - the same unpleasant woman who had accompanied Evelyn that fateful day.

Olivia had since learned Victoria was the youngest daughter of the prestigious Clarke dynasty.

Now Victoria stood in Gregory's studio, specifically demanding Olivia's services. Clearly word had spread about Olivia's new position, and Victoria had come looking for trouble.

Concerned that Victoria might cause a scene and inadvertently put Gregory in a difficult position, Olivia rushed downstairs.

There stood Victoria, as haughty and disdainful as ever, draped in an ostentatious scarlet dress. She clutched a paper bag while surveying the studio with palpable contempt.

Spotting Olivia descending the stairs, Victoria's face twisted into a sneer. "So it is you! Excellent. Fix this for me. I'll pay half a million."

With that, Victoria slammed the paper bag onto the table, its mysterious contents rattling ominously.

"Olivia has just joined our studio as an apprentice," Marcus stated firmly, his expression stern. Having recognized Victoria's malicious intent, his displeasure was evident. "She's not yet taking independent commissions."

"Why not? Doesn't this studio boast it can restore anything? Or are you afraid she'll ruin it and damage your precious reputation?" Victoria taunted.

"If you want it restored, leave the item here and trust our judgment on who handles it," Marcus countered, his brow furrowing.

But Victoria only raised her voice further. "I insist Olivia does it. If you refuse, I'll make sure everyone knows your studio can't handle simple challenges. The choice is yours!"
###Chapter 33

The tension in the air was palpable as Victoria Clarke made her intentions clear. Olivia Sinclair knew that even if she walked out of Gregory Thornton's studio right now, it wouldn't change anything.

Stepping forward, Olivia gestured her willingness to take on the repair job, asking if Victoria could open the paper bag to reveal its contents.

"What's she saying?" Victoria demanded rudely, unable to understand sign language.

Marcus Whitmore translated, "She said she can fix it and wants you to open the bag so she can see what's inside." His concerned gaze flickered between Olivia and Victoria before settling on the latter.

"Well, aren't you confident!" Victoria sneered, yanking open the bag to reveal a box bearing the Rowan logo.

"Is this supposed to be an antique?" Marcus frowned immediately.

"And why not?" Victoria lifted the lid with dramatic flair, exposing a pile of turquoise fragments barely recognizable as jewelry.

"These were matching bracelets - Rowan's very first products from one hundred ten years ago! Doesn't that qualify as antique?" Victoria declared with self-righteous satisfaction.

Gregory's studio had handled luxury antiques before, but these shattered pieces presented a far greater challenge than a vase with reference images.

Olivia moved closer, carefully examining the fragments.

"Five hundred thousand!" Victoria produced a black credit card with a flourish. "Full payment upfront. Your studio's reputation speaks for itself - I'm not worried about you running off with the money."

Marcus glanced at Olivia, his raised eyebrow asking the silent question.

Olivia nodded firmly. She signed to Marcus that she could handle the repair, but warned that Victoria clearly had ulterior motives. They needed to protect the studio's reputation.

Marcus assured her the team would handle everything else so she could focus solely on the restoration. They'd dealt with difficult clients before.

"Enough with the hand signals! Can you do it or not?" Victoria snapped.

"We'll take the job," Marcus replied coolly, locking eyes with Victoria. "Olivia will handle the restoration personally. No assistants. You're welcome to record the process or observe in person."

Victoria's lips curled into a sly smile. "That won't be necessary. I trust your studio's reputation. If you insist on no observers, I'll take your word for it. No recordings needed."

Olivia's instincts flared at Victoria's refusal. She knew documenting every step would be crucial for her own protection.

Before she could sign her concerns, Marcus produced a camera and contract. "Since you're paying upfront, we'll proceed immediately. Please review and sign the contract. The entire transaction will be recorded to document the items' condition before restoration."

Victoria's face darkened, but she complied. After a tense moment, she turned on her heel and left, while Olivia carefully gathered the fragments and returned to her workstation.

"Planning to take these home to work on them?" Marcus asked.

Olivia shook her head, explaining she lacked the proper tools at home and that Liam would likely disapprove if he saw her working on the pieces.

"Understood," Marcus said. "When you leave today, lock the bracelets in your cabinet and set a new password yourself."

It was obvious Victoria's appearance wasn't coincidence. Someone in the studio must have tipped her off, possibly planning to sabotage Olivia's work.

Olivia nodded in agreement.

Rather than diving straight into repairs, Olivia meticulously examined each fragment, photographing them from multiple angles to reconstruct their original form. She searched online for information about the historic bracelets. Though over a century old, the brand still existed, making it possible to find similar designs.

However, none of the reference images matched what lay before her.

As dinner time approached, Olivia decided to call it a day. She'd hoped to beat Liam home, but found him already waiting in the living room - not only home, but unusually early.

Startled, Olivia automatically offered him a smile.

"Did you go to Gregory's studio today? We agreed you wouldn't work." Liam stood, his expression stormy.

Olivia quickly explained she'd only gone to learn, not to work regularly - it hardly counted as employment.

"Don't go back," Liam commanded, his tone leaving no room for argument.

Olivia's brows drew together, a spark of anger igniting in her chest. For the first time in years, she felt Liam was being unreasonable.

Previously, any disagreement made Olivia assume she was at fault. She'd always placed Liam on a pedestal, feeling unworthy of him. But now, for the first time, she believed he was the one being unfair.

For the first time, Olivia didn't immediately obey. Instead, she signed her question with deliberate movements, her brow furrowed in challenge. Why did he want her trapped at home when he was never there himself? What did he really think of her?

Liam's expression darkened further. "Olivia."

Rather than retreating, Olivia held his gaze, silently demanding an answer to what she truly meant to him.

Instead of responding, Liam suddenly closed the distance between them, cupped her chin, and kissed her.
###Chapter 34

Liam's intoxicating scent enveloped Olivia, making her knees weaken as he pulled her tighter against his muscular frame. His large hand tore through her blouse, slipping beneath the lace of her bra.

Olivia's heart pounded with indignation. What was Liam playing at? She'd deliberately disobeyed him by coming to the restoration studio after his explicit prohibition. She'd challenged his motives and his perception of her - and now he thought intimacy would magically resolve everything?

A surge of rebellion coursed through her veins. Olivia pushed against Liam's chest with all her strength, but his iron grip effortlessly pinned her wrists above her head. His breath was hot against her ear as he growled, "Behave yourself and do as you're told."

Defiance burned in Olivia's chest. Why should she? When Liam leaned in again, she sank her teeth into his lower lip.

The metallic tang of blood flooded their mouths. Liam jerked back with a pained groan, releasing her immediately.

Olivia scrambled backward, clutching her torn clothing, watching him like a trapped animal.

"You bit me?" Liam touched his bleeding lip, disbelief flashing across his handsome features.

Olivia stood her ground, her entire posture radiating refusal. With sharp, angry gestures, she signed her question - what did he truly think of her?

Liam's expression darkened into something unreadable, his eyes becoming fathomless pools of shadow.

Needing clarity, Olivia signed another question - did he treat Evelyn this way? Would he ever dare manhandle Evelyn like this?

A storm gathered in Liam's stormcloud-gray eyes.

Bracing for impact, Olivia squeezed her eyes shut, expecting violence.

Instead, she heard the rustle of fabric as Liam grabbed his jacket. The door slammed with such force the walls trembled.

Olivia's pulse didn't calm until she saw the taillights of Liam's black Bentley disappear down the street. His lip was bleeding - what excuse would he give Evelyn?

Strangely, the thought of Liam with Evelyn no longer twisted her heart. It felt irrelevant now. Only one thing mattered - excelling in her restoration work.

At dawn, Olivia arrived at Gregory's studio, fueled by last night's confrontation and newfound determination. After brief greetings with colleagues, she settled at her workstation.

Rather than immediately repairing Victoria's bracelet, Olivia meticulously examined each fragment. Several metal pieces puzzled her - were they genuine components or deliberate decoys? If authentic, their placement eluded her. If not, they were surely Victoria's attempt to sabotage her work.

Olivia spent the morning analyzing the fragments until Marcus interrupted with a knock.

"Lunchtime," Marcus announced, holding a takeout bag. He eyed her cluttered workspace. "You forgot to eat again. Come with me."

Olivia nodded and followed Marcus to the lounge. She gestured toward the food, asking the cost so she could transfer payment.

"Just a few dollars," Marcus waved dismissively. "Consider it an apology for being harsh yesterday. My treat."

Olivia smiled gratefully, joking in sign language that he'd actually given her the perfect opportunity to prove herself.

Their conversation halted at the sound of approaching footsteps.

Olivia looked up - and froze. Liam stood in the doorway.

Dressed in a tailored obsidian suit, he exuded authority, his icy gaze locking onto Olivia.

She rose slowly, uncertainty flickering in her eyes.

"The reception area is downstairs," Marcus said, stepping forward with polite firmness.

Though aware of Olivia's domestic situation and recognizing Liam immediately, Marcus feigned ignorance, his tone laced with subtle hostility. He criticized Liam for suppressing Olivia's remarkable talents by confining her to domestic life.

Liam ignored him completely, his predatory gaze never leaving Olivia as he advanced.

Panic rising, Olivia intercepted him, gesturing toward the hallway.

Liam paused, shot Marcus a lethal glare, and followed her out.

By the floor-to-ceiling windows, Liam turned to her. "Does my presence embarrass you?"

Olivia shook her head vehemently.

"Do you truly need to work here?" Liam's voice softened marginally.

Olivia signed passionately about how artifact restoration brought her joy - something she hadn't experienced since their marriage.

She wanted to stay. After a pause, she reminded him of the twenty million required for their divorce.

Liam's expression darkened dangerously.

She explained that the studio would help her earn the money faster than the bookstore, accelerating their separation.

The sum seemed impossible, but it was her only hope.

Liam's gaze turned volcanic. "Fine."

With a mocking smirk, he suddenly yanked her close, kissing her fiercely despite his still-bleeding lip.

Olivia resisted minimally, hyperaware of their public setting. What was Liam thinking, doing this at her workplace?

Thankfully, the kiss ended quickly. Liam pulled away after moments, his hands lingering at her waist before thrusting a small box into her hands and striding off without explanation.

Heart racing, Olivia turned to find Marcus awkwardly hovering in the doorway.

"Food's getting cold," he said, clearing his throat.

Olivia tucked the box away and returned to lunch.

Later, curiosity overpowered her. She opened Liam's mysterious gift - and gasped. Inside lay an antique bracelet nearly identical to the one she was currently restoring.
###Chapter 35

Olivia's breath caught in her throat as she examined the delicate bracelet in her palm. The unmistakable Whitmore insignia glinted under the studio lights, but the engraved date told a different story - not from the founding year, but two years later.

Her fingers trembled slightly as she turned the piece over. The design mirrored Victoria's damaged bracelet with uncanny precision, down to the smallest filigree detail.

Then she found it.

A nearly invisible latch concealed along the inner curve. With careful pressure, the hidden compartment sprang open, revealing its secret purpose. Olivia's pulse quickened as realization dawned - this was the key to restoring Victoria's heirloom.

But why would Liam give her this? He'd never shown interest in her restoration work before. She remembered the storm in his eyes when she'd mentioned earning money for their impending divorce. The man was an enigma wrapped in tailored suits.

Shaking off her thoughts, Olivia reached for her tools. The restoration flowed effortlessly now that she understood the mechanism. Enamel met metal under her skilled hands, the hot-melt gun sealing fractures with surgical precision.

Marcus summoned Gregory to inspect her work. The master restorer examined every angle through his loupe before breaking into a proud smile. His hands moved in quick, approving gestures - "Natural talent," they said. "Just like when I first discovered you."

Olivia ducked her head, signing her gratitude for his mentorship. The personal seal Gregory pressed into the velvet box lid marked his official approval - and her professional triumph.

"Ensure you personally deliver this tomorrow," Marcus instructed as she packaged the finished piece.

When Victoria arrived the next day, her crimson lips curled in a smile that didn't reach her eyes. She accepted the box with careless grace, as if holding a winning card.

That evening, Olivia returned Liam's bracelet to his study, certain he wouldn't notice. But as she prepared for bed, the bedroom door swung open. Water droplets glistened on Liam's bare chest where his robe gaped open.

He tossed the bracelet onto the duvet. "Explain."

Olivia signed that she no longer needed the reference piece.

Liam's jaw tightened. "Keep it." The words came out gruff, almost reluctant.

She stored it in her nightstand, determined to return it after the divorce. Then Liam dropped another bombshell - an embossed invitation fluttered onto the bed.

"The Whitmore gala. You're attending."

Olivia's stomach knotted as she read William Hayes' birthday celebration details. Why would Liam want her there after last time's disaster?

On the evening of the event, Olivia chose an understated navy gown. Even with her eyes downcast, she felt the weight of curious stares as they entered the grand ballroom. The whispers were more subdued this time, the greetings politely restrained.

The ceremony began with family tributes. Victoria took center stage, the golden child basking in attention. Then she presented a familiar velvet box.

"Grandfather, our ancestral bracelet - restored to honor you today."

Olivia's blood ran cold when she saw the broken seal. As William opened the box, her worst fears materialized - deep scratches marred the once-pristine surface.

Victoria's triumphant gaze locked onto Olivia's across the room.

The trap had sprung.
###Chapter 36

"It's quite remarkable to have restored it to this condition," William remarked, his voice tinged with admiration as he examined the delicate engravings on the bracelet.

"I recall seeing this bracelet shattered beyond recognition. Achieving even partial restoration was an extraordinary accomplishment."

Olivia's pulse quickened. She desperately wanted to explain the truth of what had transpired.

"Grandfather, the restorer guaranteed it was flawlessly repaired and ready to wear. How could it have broken again? She must have lied to me!" Victoria's sharp voice sliced through the air, dripping with manufactured outrage.

"Is that so?" William inquired, his interest visibly piqued. "Which restorer did you employ?"

"I'll call her immediately," Victoria declared, pulling out her phone with dramatic flair.

Olivia's stomach twisted with dread, anticipating the impending confrontation. Right on cue, her phone vibrated loudly in her clutch. She rarely received calls, particularly from unknown numbers, and had forgotten to silence her device. The sudden ringing immediately drew every eye in the room.

"So, you're here after all!" Victoria exclaimed triumphantly, her finger jabbing accusingly toward Olivia.

As Olivia's phone continued to ring, the guests who had initially dismissed her presence now regarded her with heightened interest. Her dramatic entrance with Liam had already sparked whispers. Now, her apparent involvement with the Whitmore family's precious heirloom added fuel to the gossip fire.

"I remember the Blackwood family's adopted daughter dabbled in restoration as a child. Who knew she'd turn it into a profession?" one society matron murmured, setting off a ripple of similar comments.

"Is this some sort of hobby, or has she fallen on desperate times?"

The whispers grew louder, speculation about Olivia's motives swirling through the elegant ballroom.

William, ever the gentleman, rose with dignified curiosity. "Mrs. Blackwood, were you responsible for this restoration?" he inquired politely.

Liam stepped forward protectively. "My wife has considerable skill in restoration. However, since there appears to be an issue, I'm prepared to compensate for any damages."

"I already paid five hundred thousand for this repair!" Victoria interjected sharply.

The amount sent shockwaves through the assembled guests.

"Half a million for a bracelet? That's outrageous!"

"Mrs. Blackwood must be exploiting her connections for profit!"

"I thought her restoration work was just a pastime. Clearly it's a business venture."

"Could she really have swindled Victoria out of that much money?"

Each barbed comment struck Olivia like a physical blow, resurrecting painful memories of past accusations.

But what wounded deepest was Liam's immediate assumption of her guilt and his readiness to pay rather than defend her. Once again, Victoria had set her up - just like at the hospital incident. And once again, Liam chose to believe others over his own wife.

"What nonsense is this?" William suddenly interrupted. "It's merely a broken bracelet. The fact it was restored at all is impressive enough. Consider this half million my gift to Mrs. Blackwood," he declared, waving his hand dismissively as he instructed Victoria to put the bracelet away.

Recognizing this might be her only opportunity, Olivia gathered her courage and stepped forward, positioning herself directly before William.

The guests watched with rapt attention as William regarded her with polite curiosity. Liam moved closer, hissing through clenched teeth, "The matter is settled. Don't make a scene."

Olivia responded firmly through sign language, insisting the matter wasn't settled because she wasn't at fault. She added that if Liam wouldn't help her communicate, she would explain the situation herself.

Determination steeled her resolve as she prepared to clear her name.

Liam's expression darkened, but after a tense moment, he relented. "Fine. Have it your way."

Taking a steadying breath, Olivia signed that she had indeed restored the bracelet to perfection, with video documentation of the entire process. The piece had been flawless when she returned it to Miss Clarke.

Liam's jaw tightened visibly.

Before Liam could translate, William suddenly spoke up in surprise. "You're saying the bracelet was perfect when you returned it? And you have video proof? May I see it?"

The entire room gasped at William's unexpected fluency in sign language.

Victoria stood frozen, her face draining of color.

Olivia nodded and produced the USB drive she'd prepared for exactly this moment.

###Chapter 37

The moment the USB connected and the banquet hall's projector flickered to life, Victoria Clarke's face twisted in frustration. "Are you serious? Over ten hours of footage? This has to be intentional!"

Liam Blackwood's sharp voice cut through the murmurs. "Just focus on the final result."

Olivia Sinclair glanced at Liam, surprised by his unexpected defense. Victoria's cheeks burned crimson as whispers and stifled laughter spread through the gathered guests.

"Why does Victoria look so guilty? What is she hiding?"

"What possible reason could she have for framing Mrs. Blackwood?"

Victoria's fingers clenched around her skirt fabric, her mind racing for an escape route from the mounting suspicion.

Meanwhile, Olivia expertly navigated the computer and played the restoration video. The high-definition footage zoomed in on the fully restored bracelet - flawless, as if never broken. Even the microscopic seams where fragments had been painstakingly rejoined were invisible to the naked eye.

A collective gasp swept through the room at the impeccable craftsmanship.

The video showed Olivia carefully placing the restored bracelet into a presentation box, which Gregory Thornton had then sealed with his distinctive emblem. Though Gregory himself didn't appear in the footage, his renowned authentication mark was unmistakable.

"You work at Gregory Thornton's restoration studio?" William Hayes exclaimed, rushing toward Olivia with sudden reverence.

Caught off guard, Olivia simply nodded.

William's entire demeanor transformed. "My dear, why didn't you say so earlier? I must apologize profoundly for this misunderstanding. Please forgive my granddaughter's foolishness."

To everyone's shock, William guided Olivia to the seat of honor, treating her with more respect than his own flesh and blood.

Olivia sat stiffly, confusion written across her features.

"Grandfather, I—" Victoria stammered, equally stunned by William's reaction to Gregory's name. Her prepared excuses died on her lips when William cut her off.

"Apologize to Mrs. Blackwood immediately! How dare you accuse someone from Gregory Thornton's studio? This is beyond disgraceful!"

Tears welled in Victoria's eyes as her earlier arrogance evaporated. "I didn't mean to... It was an accident..."

William Hayes was notorious for his temper, especially with family. Privileges could be revoked, allowances cut without hesitation. Despite her hatred for Olivia, Victoria stepped forward with practiced remorse. "I'm sorry, Olivia. I should have been more careful with the bracelet after your incredible work. I never meant to falsely accuse you."

Olivia began to sign her response, but before she could type it out, Liam smoothly interpreted. "Normal wear wouldn't cause this type of damage. Pieces restored by Gregory's studio are nearly as durable as the originals."

Olivia wasn't trying to humiliate Victoria - she simply refused to let anyone believe Gregory's restorations were fragile.

Her hands moved again, pointing at the damaged bracelet as Liam translated. "These fractures weren't caused by accidental drops. Look here - these are clearly hammer strikes. See the distinctive impact marks?"

William hastily put on his reading glasses. After a brief inspection, he inhaled sharply. "She's right! This was deliberate vandalism!"

Victoria's tears flowed freely now - not from guilt, but from her scheme unraveling. She adopted a pitiful expression, hoping for mercy.

William showed none. His palm connected sharply with her cheek. "Don't play the fool with me! Did you think I wouldn't recognize intentional damage when I saw it?"

Victoria clutched her stinging face, too terrified to continue crying.

Her flimsy excuse collapsed under scrutiny. The Hayes family meticulously inspected all gifts before important events. Any damage would have been noticed immediately - meaning this was premeditated.

The slap silenced the room until a young guest whispered, "William's temper hasn't softened. When I was twelve, he caught me climbing his prized magnolia and tanned my hide right there in the garden. I avoided Hayes Manor for years after that."

Turning back to Olivia, William's voice softened. "My deepest apologies for tonight's disgrace. I'll personally visit Gregory's studio to make amends."

Olivia shook her head - the cleared misunderstanding was satisfaction enough.

"Wait... you look familiar," William said suddenly. "Aren't you the Reeves girl? Olivia?"

This recognition was no coincidence. To society, Olivia had always been just Liam Blackwood's silent wife. Now, her proven skill demanded their respect.

Olivia nodded, offering William a warm smile as she signed that she remembered him too.

"I recall your childhood fascination with antiques! I was there when Gregory took you as his apprentice at the Reeves estate!" William exclaimed excitedly.

He turned to his butler. "Bring the Ming Dynasty blue-and-white porcelain set from my study."

Facing Olivia again, William smiled. "I've had this set for decades. Two pieces need restoration - work I believe only you can perform."

Olivia's eyes widened at the unexpected commission.

William announced to the room, "This is my gift to you. I hope you'll accept it."

Shocked murmurs rippled through the crowd.

This porcelain set was William's most prized possession - priceless on the antiquities market. Countless collectors had offered fortunes for it, always refused. Now he was gifting it to Olivia.
###Chapter 38

Olivia froze in place, her hands trembling as she stared at the extravagant gift. She shook her head violently, signing that she couldn't possibly accept something so precious.

"It's nothing, really." William gave her hand a reassuring squeeze. "Henry adored you. You deserve every beautiful thing this world has to offer."

William's eyes glistened with emotion. The vibrant, brilliant Olivia he remembered had dimmed after marrying Liam. But today, watching her stand tall before the crowd, reclaiming her passion and proving her worth, he caught glimpses of the radiant girl she used to be.

Thanks to William's public endorsement, Olivia became the unexpected star of the evening.

No longer just "Mrs. Blackwood," people now addressed her by name, eagerly shaking her hand. Several guests even attempted basic sign language to communicate with her directly.

Olivia felt transported back to her days as the cherished adopted daughter of the Blackwood family. Not because of her title, but because her talent and capability commanded respect.

"She's too thin." Liam's sharp comment sliced through Olivia's daze.

She blinked, realizing he'd contradicted someone who'd complimented her slender figure.

"Proper nutrition is crucial. My daughter struggles with appetite too, so we hired a team of nutritionists—" a guest explained to Liam.

Olivia expected Liam to brush off the conversation, but to her surprise, he listened intently.

As the event concluded, Liam escorted Olivia to their car. Settling into the plush leather seats, Olivia couldn't suppress a contented smile.

"Happy?" Liam's deep voice cut through the silence.

Olivia nodded cautiously, studying his reaction. He'd always discouraged her from social engagements. Did he think she'd embarrassed him tonight? She couldn't think of any misstep.

"Do you enjoy restoration work?" Liam pressed further.

Encouraged by his calm tone, Olivia nodded enthusiastically, her smile widening. For the first time in years, she felt valued for her own abilities.

Liam's expression darkened instantly. He remembered Olivia's reason for taking the job—to earn twenty million quickly, pay him off, and secure their divorce. Was that smile because she envisioned freedom from him? The thought made his jaw tighten.

Noticing his mood shift, Olivia immediately lowered her head, schooling her features. She assumed her muteness always shamed him.

True to pattern, Liam didn't return to the mansion that night.

But the next morning brought an astonishing development. Descending the grand staircase, Olivia found the foyer crowded with white-uniformed nutritionists and chefs.

Liam leaned against the doorway, phone in hand. When he noticed Olivia, he pocketed the device and declared, "They're here to ensure you eat properly. No more skipping meals."

Olivia's breath caught. This stemmed from yesterday's conversation. Was this Liam's way of caring?

The hopeful thought flickered briefly before she extinguished it. More likely, he found her thinness unattractive compared to Evelyn's curves.

She gave a polite nod.

"They'll prepare all your meals. No more takeout," Liam added sharply, clearly referencing the food Marcus had brought to her studio recently.

Though the takeout came from an exclusive gourmet kitchen near her workplace, Olivia didn't argue.

Hesitantly, she signed a question about taking meals to the studio, explaining that restoration work required her presence and commuting home for lunch would disrupt her schedule.

Liam's response was ice. "Freshly prepared food is superior. Is your work more important than your health?"

Olivia quickly shook her head, acquiescing to return home for lunch. She understood this was less about nutrition and more about controlling her movements.

"Inform the nutritionist of your preferences," Liam said before striding away.

Alone at the dining table, Olivia texted Marcus: "Can I reduce to half-days? Need to lunch at home now."

Marcus replied instantly: "Of course, come whenever you're free."

She exhaled in relief, but then another message popped up: "Does your husband dictate all your meals? This is textbook control. Have you considered divorce? I know an excellent attorney."

Olivia's hands shook violently. Before she could delete the damning message, Liam's shadow fell across the table.

"Who are you texting?" His voice was dangerously calm.
###Chapter 39

Olivia quickly locked her phone screen. She turned to Liam with a guilty expression, explaining she was just requesting time off from the studio.

"You said it wasn't a real job. So why ask for leave?" Liam's voice dripped with sarcasm.

Olivia clarified it was technically an apprenticeship, but she still had to follow studio protocols.

"And since it's just an apprenticeship, how's the pay? How much will Gregory contribute to Victoria's half-million repair bill?" Liam pressed further.

Olivia's throat tightened. She hadn't discussed finances with Gregory yet. Though eager to earn, she knew twenty million wouldn't appear overnight. Gregory had been generous. Even if the entire fifty thousand for Victoria's repairs went to the studio, she'd accept it.

Her success at William's birthday gala had already boosted her reputation. More restoration projects would come.

Fortunately, Liam didn't push. He gave Olivia one intense look before turning away.

For the first time, Olivia kept something from Liam. She watched him leave, her pulse racing.

After breakfast, Olivia rushed to the studio. She needed to return by noon - only a morning's work remained.

She left the azure-glazed porcelain William gifted her, needing more research before restoration.

At noon, Olivia prepared to leave when two studio girls approached. "Join us for lunch?" they asked.

Olivia explained she needed to eat at home. The girls hesitated. "Could we come to your place instead?"

Olivia considered. Liam had been home more frequently lately, though his visits were brief. He'd never forbidden guests - just her going out.

Plus, one girl had defended Olivia when she first arrived. She felt comfortable accepting.

That afternoon, the girls visited bearing small gifts. Aside from Natalie, they were Olivia's first home guests.

They stayed through dinner. Thankfully, Liam returned earlier than usual. He barely spoke, just inquired about her meals before going upstairs.

Thirty minutes later, the doorbell rang.

The butler answered, then escorted in one of the earlier guests. "Miss Reynolds thinks she lost an earring here," he explained.

Sophia Reynolds, who'd barely interacted with Olivia before, seemed flustered as she explained the missing jewelry.

Olivia nodded to the butler. "Ask her where she thinks it fell. I'll help search."

"No need!" Sophia interrupted. "I'll look myself. Probably dropped during our movie this afternoon."

The home theater sat near the first-floor stairs. Olivia instructed the butler to take Sophia there.

From a distance, Olivia overheard Sophia whispering to the butler before he left her alone in the theater.

Concerned, Olivia moved to check when she noticed Sophia sneaking out - behaving oddly.

Perhaps Sophia misremembered where she'd lost the earring? But before Olivia could ask, she saw Sophia heading upstairs, unbuttoning her blouse to reveal cleavage.

Realization struck. No one had gone upstairs that afternoon. Sophia couldn't have lost anything there.

This wasn't about a missing earring. Sophia wanted Liam - and had ulterior motives.
###Chapter 40

Olivia felt an undeniable urge to step in. As Liam's wife, it was her duty to stop the scandal unfolding before her. Yet her feet remained rooted to the spot.

Rumors about Liam's infidelities had spread beyond Evelyn's circle. Olivia wondered if other women had tried seducing him like this.

She lingered at the foot of the staircase, listening intently. Liam could be showering or working in his study upstairs.

Minutes ticked by as Olivia stood frozen, half-expecting to hear compromising sounds. Liam and Evelyn had never cared about her feelings before. Why would he start now?

A sudden crash shattered the silence, followed by a woman's shriek. "I'm sorry! So terribly sorry, Mr. Blackwood! I—I entered the wrong room—"

The commotion brought the butler and staff running. Spotting Olivia by the stairs, the butler gasped. "Madam?"

Looking up, Olivia met Liam's stormy gaze from the landing. His expression darkened with visible anger.

On the floor sat Sophia, hugging her shoulders as she trembled and wept.

"Did you plan this?" Liam demanded, eyes locked on Olivia.

Olivia shook her head vehemently. The butler intervened, "Sir, Miss Reynolds is acquainted with your wife. She visited earlier and returned claiming she'd forgotten an earring—"

"In my study?" Liam cut him off.

"No! I—I went to the wrong room—" Sophia stammered.

"Your wife and her guest never went upstairs this afternoon," the butler confirmed.

"Are you here to steal documents?" Liam's suspicion was palpable as he glared at Sophia.

Sophia's fear escalated. "No! I swear!"

"Call the police. She's attempting to steal Blackwood Enterprises' confidential files," Liam ordered coldly.

"I'm not! Truly!" Sophia cried desperately, turning to Olivia. "Olivia! I only wanted to get close to Mr. Blackwood, not steal anything—"

Overwhelmed, Sophia confessed everything. The thought of being accused terrified her more than the humiliation.

Olivia averted her gaze.

Realizing her mistake in seeking help from the wife she'd tried to betray, Sophia turned to the butler instead. "Please—"

The butler, taking Liam's silent cue, scoffed. "Prove your innocence. Submit your phone and undergo a search. Or we call the police. Your choice."

The humiliation of a search paled against potential legal consequences. With clenched teeth, Sophia relented. "Fine. Search me."

As the butler led her away, Sophia shot Olivia a venomous glare.

Now alone on the staircase, Olivia couldn't meet Liam's gaze. She expected him to walk past, but instead he descended until standing directly before her. "You saw everything, didn't you? Watched her approach me and did nothing? What game are you playing, Olivia?"

Speechless, Olivia froze as Liam grasped her chin, forcing eye contact.

"Do you enjoy watching women throw themselves at me? Did you invite her here knowing her intentions?" His words cut like knives.

Olivia shook her head frantically. She'd assumed Liam could handle such situations himself. What right had she to interfere?

Tears welled in her eyes as she failed to voice her thoughts.

Liam studied her tear-streaked face before his expression unexpectedly softened. "She's your colleague, yes? How do you think she'll treat you tomorrow?"

Dread washed over Olivia. Liam was right. Regardless of outcome, Sophia would retaliate. Especially if she was Victoria's informant at the studio.

Olivia wasn't afraid for herself, but worried about Gregory.

Seeing her realization, Liam leaned closer. "I can handle this for you... if you please me." His fingers trailed down her shirt, undoing buttons one by one.
###Chapter 41

Olivia's entire body trembled, yet she didn't pull away this time. Only when Liam pinned her against the mattress did realization strike. Flushing crimson, she raised a hand to halt his advance, silently mouthing that she was ovulating.

Heat flooded her cheeks as she avoided his gaze, communicating her concern through frantic gestures. Liam paused momentarily before rising to search the nightstand drawer. When his weight settled over her again, Olivia caught the low rumble of his laughter.

"After all this time together, you're still blushing like a bride?"

The term "together" pierced Olivia's heart. While technically accurate, she felt more like a temporary roommate than Liam's wife. Exhausted from their encounter, Olivia barely dragged herself to the studio by midday. Immediately, she noticed the absence - Sophia, who'd attempted to seduce Liam yesterday, was conspicuously missing.

Inquiries revealed Sophia had been terminated. Liam's solution was characteristically blunt. But unease prickled Olivia's spine. Did Liam wield this much influence over Gregory's studio? Was Gregory being coerced?

Though Gregory had always been close with Henry, Olivia never suspected Liam had forged his own connection. Seizing a moment when Gregory stepped away from clients, she approached him directly.

"Was Sophia fired because of incompetence?" she demanded.

Gregory confirmed with equal directness, citing professional shortcomings.

After a weighted pause, Olivia voiced her real concern. "Did Liam pressure you?"

Gregory's expression tightened imperceptibly, offering no clear answer. Anxiety coiling tighter, Olivia pressed further, fearing her presence caused complications.

Gregory dismissed her worries with a shake of his head. "No one's pressuring anyone." Yet guilt gnawed at Olivia - was he simply being kind, refusing to blame her for the disruption?

His smile didn't reach his eyes as he redirected, reminding her to submit payment details to Marcus for her first assignment bonus - a staggering five hundred thousand.

Olivia's jaw dropped. She moved to refuse, but Gregory had already summoned Marcus and returned to work, clearly avoiding further discussion.

"The studio takes five percent commission moving forward," Marcus informed during the transfer. "Gregory's reputation brings most clients."

Olivia nodded, impressed by the modest rate. Hesitating, she voiced her deeper concern. "Can Gregory protect himself from clients like Victoria? Or... Liam?"

Marcus chuckled. "Worried about more Victoria drama?" At Olivia's nod, he continued, "Jerome promised to explain everything personally. Anyone causing trouble here gets dealt with - heard Victoria's allowance got cut? She's scrambling now."

He shrugged. "Gregory's untouchable. Don't stress."

Somewhat reassured, Olivia dined alone that evening - Liam hadn't returned. Her thoughts drifted to an article about Eldermere's newest haute cuisine hotspot, exactly the sort of place Evelyn would drag Liam.

Assuming he'd be occupied, Olivia changed into casual wear, directing her driver to the bookstore where Natalie waited.

Natalie read her tension instantly. "Sweetheart, what's wrong? Liam again?"

Olivia shook her head, outlining her suspicions about Liam complicating Gregory's affairs, seeking advice.

Ever pragmatic, Natalie waved it off. "Gregory and Henry were close. Liam wouldn't risk offending his grandfather's ally. Probably just let Sophia go to avoid drama."

When Olivia expressed doubt about Gregory's evasiveness, Natalie shrugged. "Maybe he didn't consider it worth mentioning. Stop overthinking - Gregory can handle himself."

Olivia's shoulders relaxed slightly.

"I found some restoration manuals earlier - " Natalie began, when shattering glass cut her off.

They whirled toward the sound. Through the fractured bookstore window, a gang of hooded figures brandished baseball bats.

"This the place?" growled one.

"Light it up!" another shouted.

A brick sailed through another pane, exploding in a shower of glass shards.
###Chapter 42

"What the hell are you doing? Back off! I'm dialing 911 right now!" Natalie's panicked scream echoed through the bookstore as she fumbled for her phone.

The masked intruders didn't even flinch. Some continued overturning shelves while two advanced toward Olivia and Natalie with clear malicious intent. Natalie grabbed Olivia's wrist, yanking her toward the storage area.

Both women knew the layout intimately, weaving through the labyrinth of bookshelves. But their escape route was hopeless - the front door was blocked, the back exit sealed. They were trapped like mice in a cage.

"I'm calling Daniel! He'll get us out!" Natalie hissed, shoving Olivia into a narrow alcove beneath the staircase.

Crammed in the tight space, Natalie whispered, "These aren't negotiators. Cops won't get here in time." She frantically dialed her brother while Olivia silently texted emergency services.

Olivia's pulse hammered against her ribs. This attack was meant for her, not Natalie. Retribution from Ryan, Sophia, or Evelyn? Had her past sins dragged innocent Natalie into danger?

"Find those bitches! They can't have gone far!" growled a voice from the main floor.

"Burn it all before the pigs arrive!"

Olivia's blood turned to ice as the sharp tang of gasoline assaulted her senses. She clutched Natalie's hand just as a lighter flicked open, igniting the exit in a whoosh of flames. Fire erupted, sealing them inside.

"Cough... God... can't breathe..." Natalie doubled over, eyes streaming from smoke. "Fire extinguisher - storage closet!" she gasped, lurching forward.

Olivia knew it was pointless. The inferno was spreading too fast. These weren't random thugs - this was a calculated hit. The crushing guilt nearly suffocated her before the smoke could. The Blackwoods had no enemies this vicious - this was her doing. Her entanglement with Ryan, Sophia and Evelyn had brought this hell upon them. Natalie was collateral damage in someone's twisted revenge.

Just as despair threatened to consume her, Olivia spotted it - a narrow ventilation window near the ceiling. With sudden clarity, she dragged Natalie toward it, gesturing frantically.

"Too high for me. You go first," Natalie argued weakly between coughs. "I'll boost you up."

Olivia shook her head violently. She wouldn't abandon Natalie. This was her mess to clean up. Ignoring the searing heat, Olivia interlaced her fingers to form a step, heaving Natalie upward with all her strength.

The smoke grew unbearable, stealing their voices. Olivia kept pushing Natalie toward salvation, her arms trembling with effort.

"Olivia, I won't leave you!" Natalie's sob cut through the roar of flames. "I'll bring help - just hold on!"

With one final shove, Natalie tumbled through the window just as a fresh wave of black smoke swallowed Olivia whole.

Olivia collapsed, hacking violently. Her shaking fingers found her phone - five rapid presses activated the emergency SOS. Liam was her emergency contact, but would he even care enough to respond?

As flames licked closer, Olivia curled into a fetal position, consciousness flickering. Time stretched into eternity until suddenly - through the suffocating darkness - strong arms lifted her, carrying her through the deluge of fire hoses.

The cavalry had arrived. Natalie rushed forward, face streaked with tears and soot.

"Olivia! Oh God, please be okay!"

Blinking smoke from her stinging eyes, Olivia's vision cleared to reveal Liam's face - raw worry giving way to desperate relief. He'd come for her. In this nightmare, his presence felt like a miracle.

Coughing violently, Olivia realized she'd mostly escaped injury - her hiding spot had protected her from the worst. She signed a shaky 'thank you' to Liam, warmth flooding her chest.

Natalie gripped her hand like a lifeline. "I thought... I thought you were..."

Then Evelyn's shrill voice cut through the chaos. Olivia instinctively recoiled from Liam, putting distance between them. His brow furrowed at her reaction.

The terror Liam had felt hearing about the fire still vibrated in his bones. He'd raced here like a man possessed. Now, watching Olivia withdraw despite his rescue, hurt flashed in his stormy eyes.

Masking his pain, Liam turned on Evelyn, voice glacial. "Those mercenaries worked for Ryan Carter. Tell me you had nothing to do with this."

The unspoken threat hung heavy in the acrid air.
###Chapter 43

"What? Liam, what are you saying? How could this be?" Evelyn blinked, her voice trembling with shock. Tears welled in her eyes as she struggled to process his accusation. "Liam, I had no idea those men were sent by Victoria. Why would you think I'm involved? How could you suspect me?"

"Isn't your relationship with Victoria supposed to be close? At the club, didn't you two team up against Olivia? Can you honestly deny that?" Natalie interjected sharply, her voice dripping with suspicion.

Natalie, just as confused as she was furious, couldn't comprehend how Liam had pieced everything together so quickly. If Victoria was behind this attack, it was beyond despicable. Victoria had tried to humiliate Olivia before but failed spectacularly at William's birthday gala. Was this payback for that public disgrace?

"Victoria has no reason to target Olivia unless you put her up to it!" Natalie continued, glaring daggers at Evelyn.

Evelyn's eyes darted between Liam and Natalie. "She embarrassed herself at the gala! And we're not even that close! It's all just for appearances. I was teasing Olivia that day at the club, but I didn't mean any real harm!" Evelyn protested, her voice shaking as she looked pleadingly at Liam, avoiding Natalie's piercing gaze.

Liam studied Evelyn for a long moment before turning his attention to Olivia. "What do you think?"

Olivia shook her head, indicating she didn't believe Evelyn had been involved. Even if Evelyn had played innocent, Olivia knew voicing her doubts wouldn't change Liam's mind. If he truly suspected Evelyn, he would act. But it seemed Liam was merely looking for a way to close the matter without further complications. Evelyn would likely walk away unscathed. Meanwhile, Natalie's bookstore lay in ruins, with no one stepping forward to take responsibility for the damage.

"Forget it, as long as you're okay," Natalie sighed, rolling her eyes at Evelyn before moving closer to Olivia. "Let's get you to Mercy Hospital for a full check-up. You need X-rays to make sure your lungs weren't damaged."

"Yes, we should do that," Evelyn added, though her words lacked any real concern.

"I'll drive you," Liam said, ignoring Olivia's attempts to protest as he effortlessly scooped her up and carried her to his car.

Evelyn stood frozen in disbelief, watching helplessly as Liam left her behind once again, this time to tend to Olivia. The bitter scene left her feeling utterly abandoned.

Moments later, Daniel arrived, breathless and wide-eyed as he took in the bookstore's destruction. "What happened here? Natalie, are you alright?" he asked, rushing to his sister's side. But when he saw Liam holding Olivia, his expression darkened, and he hurried toward them.

Liam cut him off with an icy stare. "Go deal with your sister's enemies and find out who torched her store!" he commanded, leaving Daniel to handle the investigation while he took Olivia to the hospital.

After a thorough examination, doctors confirmed Olivia had no serious injuries. By the time they returned home, midnight had fallen.

Troubled by the day's events, Olivia gestured to Liam, asking if there'd been any updates on the attackers.

"They're being interrogated. It appears connected to Victoria," Liam replied tersely, his attention fixed on his phone, his voice devoid of emotion.

A wave of guilt crashed over Olivia. Once again, her presence had brought disaster to Natalie.

"You shouldn't visit Natalie anymore," Liam suddenly declared. "It's too dangerous."

Olivia's eyes widened. She gestured emphatically, making it clear Natalie wasn't to blame. The trouble was entirely her own fault.

"Natalie can't protect you," Liam added coldly. "She's useless."

Tears welled in Olivia's eyes. Was that all Liam saw in people - their usefulness? Natalie had nearly been hurt because of her, her livelihood destroyed. Yet Liam dismissed her dearest friend as worthless.

For the first time, Olivia pushed back. Her hands moved with unprecedented intensity, signing angrily. She made it clear Liam had no right to dictate her friendships, and she blamed herself for the mess, not Natalie. She didn't need protection from her friend - she needed to fix the problems she'd caused.

After expressing her fury, Olivia turned away and stormed upstairs, slamming her bedroom door behind her. Leaning against the door, exhausted thoughts swirled through her mind. She half-expected Liam to follow, to force the door open in anger.

But the mansion remained eerily silent.

Sliding down to the floor, Olivia felt completely drained.
###Chapter 44

Olivia stormed upstairs, her fury radiating like heat waves. Liam remained in the hallway, his expression dark with contemplation. Every fiber of his being urged him to follow her, but he clenched his fists, knowing confrontation would only fuel the fire. Instead, he reached for his phone and dialed Evelyn. Olivia had insisted neither Victoria nor Evelyn were involved, yet doubt gnawed at him like a persistent itch.

The line connected after two rings. Before Evelyn could greet him, Liam cut straight to the chase. "Do you know anything about the fire at Natalie's bookstore last night?"

Silence stretched for three heartbeats. The question had clearly caught Evelyn off guard.

"Liam, how could you?" Evelyn's voice cracked with wounded disbelief. "What has Olivia told you? Why would I ever do something like this? I've accepted my place beside you. What possible motive would I have to hurt her? It changes nothing for me."

Her words grew more frantic. "In any civilized society, I'd be behind bars for such an act! Killing Olivia would only complicate my life. Why would I invite that kind of chaos?"

Liam let the silence linger, weighing his next words carefully. "I'm not accusing you. I just need to know if Victoria mentioned anything suspicious."

"Victoria?" Confusion colored Evelyn's tone now. "Are you suggesting she's responsible? Did the police find evidence? Liam, I swear I had no knowledge if she was involved. I would have stopped her immediately! I'd never condone something so extreme over petty humiliation."

"Just tell me if she ever said anything that might explain this," Liam pressed, his voice steady but unyielding.

"Absolutely not! I never imagined her capable of this," Evelyn insisted, sincerity ringing clear. "Yes, I envy Olivia, but not enough to wish her harm. Victoria and I aren't even close. If she did this because of what happened at her grandfather's birthday, that's terrifying. I don't understand her at all."

"Alright, I believe you," Liam said evenly before ending the call.

But his investigation wasn't over. He immediately dialed his assistant. "Pull Victoria's complete schedule from when Olivia started at Gregory's studio. And trace the origins of that bracelet Olivia repaired. I want a full dossier by tonight."

Liam suspected this entire situation might have been meticulously orchestrated, with Olivia unwittingly caught in the crosshairs. Rubbing his temples, he glanced up at the closed bedroom door and chose not to pursue her.

Morning light revealed a transformed Olivia descending the stairs. Gone were her usual muted tones, replaced by vibrant colors that seemed to declare her rebirth from shadows.

The butler nearly dropped his tray. "Madam, you seem... unusually radiant this morning?"

Olivia responded with a smile, gesturing toward the dining room.

"Your favorite breakfast selections await," the butler replied, still adjusting to her metamorphosis as he pulled out her chair.

After eating, Olivia made her intentions clear - she planned to spend the entire day at the studio. She requested lunch be delivered there, even offering to take breakfast leftovers if it proved inconvenient.

The butler hesitated. Liam had recently insisted Olivia take all meals at home, a rule she'd followed - until now. "Madam, Mr. Blackwood will be displeased if you're not here for lunch."

Olivia signed sharply that Liam's displeasure was irrelevant. Her decision was final.

Without waiting for approval, she turned toward the door, her resolve unmistakable. She'd reached her limit - Liam's controlling nature, his lack of trust, it had all become unbearable. The fire had brought clarity. She didn't want his protection; she demanded her freedom.

As the door closed behind her, the butler stood frozen in conflict. Ultimately, he reached for the house phone.

When Olivia arrived at the studio, she expected her lunch delivery at noon. What she didn't anticipate was Liam himself appearing at her doorstep with it.
###Chapter 45

Olivia froze mid-step when she spotted Liam standing in the lobby, holding several takeout containers.

The memory of Liam forcing that kiss in front of Marcus flashed through her mind, making her hesitate. Today of all days, with everyone gathered downstairs for lunch, she dreaded what might happen if Liam decided to pull another public stunt. The humiliation would be unbearable.

"Don't just stand there. Come eat," Liam called out, his tone unexpectedly warm rather than commanding.

Swallowing her apprehension, Olivia approached cautiously. Liam guided her to the sofa and began unpacking the containers one by one.

Though technically takeout, the meal had been prepared by the elite chefs and nutritionists Liam employed, making it far superior to ordinary delivery.

Under different circumstances, Olivia might have invited others to join. But Liam's imposing presence created an invisible barrier that kept everyone at a distance.

She kept her eyes downcast as she ate quickly.

Liam studied her for a moment before leaning in. "What's wrong?" he murmured.

Olivia nearly choked on her food. She swallowed hastily and turned to him, confusion flickering in her eyes.

"You've gotten bold," Liam remarked.

Olivia blinked, feeling unfairly judged. She was simply enjoying a rare meal outside her usual routine. Why did Liam feel the need to comment? Couldn't she have this small freedom?

Using Liam's body as cover, Olivia discreetly signed that she'd received the full fifty thousand from Gregory after completing Victoria's restoration.

Liam's expression darkened as he turned fully toward her.

Hesitantly, Olivia suggested they proceed with the divorce now, offering to give him the fifty thousand immediately and pay the rest in installments.

The atmosphere shifted palpably. Olivia instinctively stepped back, immediately regretting bringing up the divorce in this setting.

"In such a hurry?" Liam sneered. "Found your next husband already? That eager to be rid of me?"

Heat rose in Olivia's cheeks. The accusation was absurd. Liam was the one who'd moved on. How dare he suggest otherwise?

Words failed her. Though she'd laid out all her reasons for divorce, Liam stubbornly clung to their failing marriage, ignoring her financial independence.

As Liam studied Olivia's earnest expression, thoughts of the azure porcelain set William had gifted her surfaced. Worth hundreds of millions, its sale could easily cover the twenty million he'd demanded and still leave her free to divorce. His leverage was slipping away.

"Why the rush?" Liam pressed when Olivia remained silent, his voice laced with both curiosity and fury.

Meeting his gaze, Olivia signed that she'd assumed he would be the one pushing for divorce. His reluctance baffled her, especially since he could marry Evelyn afterward.

Bracing for a public outburst, Olivia was surprised when Liam simply stood and walked away without another word.

She pondered his silent departure, a rueful smile touching her lips as she resumed eating. After all these years, she realized she still didn't understand him.

After lunch, Olivia returned upstairs to work.

As evening fell, William's booming voice announced his arrival downstairs. "I've come to explain the situation and apologize to Gregory personally on my granddaughter's behalf."

True to his banquet promise, William had come to make amends.

Choosing to stay out of it, Olivia turned on her desk lamp and focused on her work.

Footsteps approached, stopping at her desk.

"Olivia, you've already started restoring the azure porcelain? Impressive!" William exclaimed as he appeared with Gregory.

Olivia stood quickly, but William motioned for her to remain seated. "Please, don't let us interrupt your work."

Smiling, Olivia gestured that she'd just finished.

The azure porcelain set comprised eight pieces, five of which needed repairs. The piece Olivia had worked on had minimal damage, allowing her to complete it in a day.

She illuminated the translucent dish with a light, inviting William to inspect it closely.

"Incredible! Not a single flaw! Is this magic?" William joked, genuinely astonished by the flawless restoration.

With semi-transparent materials, repairs typically leave visible marks. Yet Olivia's work showed no signs of mending—a seemingly impossible feat.

Beside her, Gregory beamed with pride. "When you set your mind to something, you're truly remarkable."

"You're destined for greatness! Makes us old folks a bit jealous," William added with a chuckle.

Then William asked, "Olivia, how about I take you to dinner to make up for my granddaughter's behavior?"

Olivia blinked in surprise. Did William know about yesterday's bookstore fire? Had Liam told him?

Putting the pieces together, Olivia guessed Liam might have anticipated William's visit. She agreed to dinner, deciding not to inform Liam she wouldn't be home for the evening.
###Chapter 46

The restaurant Jerome had selected wasn't the kind of place just anyone could access. Nestled near Gregory's studio, it exuded an air of refined exclusivity with its understated luxury.

As the group stepped out of their vehicles, a sharply dressed young man greeted them at the entrance. "Grandfather," he addressed Jerome with respectful familiarity.

Jerome made introductions with a proud smile. "This is my eldest grandson, Alexander Hayes."

Alexander, being Victoria's cousin and the heir apparent to the Whitmore family empire, exchanged polite handshakes with everyone present, including Olivia.

Once seated around the elegant table with initial pleasantries exchanged, Jerome took a thoughtful sip of his jasmine tea before addressing Olivia directly. "At the recent gala, my granddaughter may have behaved inappropriately toward you. For that, I owe you an apology," he said with genuine remorse.

Olivia rose quickly, caught off guard by the unexpected apology. She assured him the incident was already forgotten, especially considering the priceless set of azure porcelain he'd gifted her as compensation.

"Your grandfather was instrumental in my early career," Jerome continued, his voice tinged with regret. "I wish I could have supported you better through your difficulties." His meaningful glance hinted at deeper concerns about her marriage.

Olivia understood the unspoken implication. Despite being married to Liam and the carefully maintained facade of their perfect union, she preferred keeping her marital struggles private. She offered Jerome a warm but guarded smile, silently conveying her appreciation while maintaining her dignity.

Jerome's expression brightened as he changed topics. "I hear you're considering starting your own venture." Leaning forward conspiratorially, he added with a chuckle, "I might have an interesting proposition for you."

Olivia hesitated. Liam had been visibly displeased when she began apprenticing at Gregory's studio. Taking on another professional commitment would undoubtedly provoke his temper further. But did his approval still matter? The thought brought a pang of sadness.

She'd come to realize his opinions shouldn't dictate her choices. After years of marriage, she knew exactly what to expect.

"At least hear me out before refusing," Jerome urged, noticing her hesitation.

Olivia met his gaze directly, signaling her willingness to listen.

"As you know, antique collecting has always been my passion - both as hobby and business venture." Jerome's eyes sparkled with enthusiasm. "I'm establishing a new company specializing in antiques. While Alexander will handle operations, we need an expert consultant. Olivia, would you consider joining us?"

Her eyes widened in surprise at being offered such a responsible position.

"Grandfather, I didn't realize you held Mrs. Blackwood in such esteem," Alexander interjected before Olivia could respond.

There was a barely perceptible skepticism in Alexander's tone as he studied Olivia. The unspoken question hung in the air - was she truly qualified?

Olivia maintained her composure. It was natural for others to doubt her capabilities after years as a sheltered society wife.

Gregory quickly came to her defense. "Olivia's restoration skills are exceptional."

"But consultancy requires more than restoration expertise," Alexander countered. "Gregory, when you opened your studio, it wasn't just about your technical skills, was it?"

Olivia understood Alexander's concern. As the Whitmore heir, he couldn't afford mistakes in their new venture. Beyond restoration, the ability to authenticate pieces was crucial to prevent costly acquisitions of counterfeits.

"Why do you assume Olivia isn't qualified?" Jerome challenged, clearly on her side.

Olivia offered a modest smile. After years away from the professional world, she felt fortunate to have retained her restoration skills at all.

Jerome's faith in her remained unshaken. Turning to Alexander, he proposed, "If you doubt Olivia's expertise, test her. If she answers correctly, you'll toast to her success tonight."

"Agreed," Alexander said, his gaze intensifying as it locked onto Olivia.

Under the weight of their expectant stares, Olivia steadied herself with a deep breath, ready to prove her worth.
###Chapter 47

Alexander's question cut through the tense atmosphere like a scalpel, demanding clarity in the midst of uncertainty. "As the newly appointed advisor to our company, what exactly is your strategy? How do you define your responsibilities?"

The inquiry sounded deceptively simple, the kind one might encounter during a routine corporate interview.

William's face darkened visibly, his irritation flaring at Alexander's blunt approach. He moved protectively closer to Olivia, ready to shield her from what he perceived as undue interrogation.

But Olivia remained unshaken. With graceful composure, she raised her hands and began signing her response.

As Olivia articulated her thoughts, William translated each gesture with precision. "Since Mr. Whitmore founded this company based on his passion for antiquities, our acquisitions should align with his personal tastes rather than chasing market trends. Blindly following fluctuations only makes us vulnerable to dealer manipulation. Certain periods are artificially inflated in value - a tactic that benefits merchants at the expense of newcomers like us."

She continued, her gestures fluid and confident. "Regarding restoration and authentication services, I propose we eliminate separate fees. Instead, we should cultivate long-term relationships with serious collectors. By becoming their trusted intermediaries for future acquisitions, we create sustainable revenue streams beyond one-time service charges."

Alexander waited patiently for each translation, his initial skepticism gradually giving way to thoughtful consideration.

William couldn't contain his pride as he conveyed Olivia's final points. "You see? Henry's protégé possesses remarkable business acumen. Olivia's strategy far surpasses your initial proposal, wouldn't you agree?"

Just minutes earlier, Alexander had doubted Olivia's qualifications. Now, his expression revealed nothing but professional respect.

His original plan had been straightforward - ride market trends for quick profits through strategic buying and selling.

But Olivia's analysis illuminated the pitfalls of such an approach for a fledgling company. Her vision offered stability and growth potential that resonated deeply with their long-term objectives.

Before William could prompt him, Alexander reached for his glass and drained it in one decisive motion. "I owe you an apology," he admitted, his voice carrying genuine contrition. "I underestimated your capabilities. Given your... domestic situation," he chose his words carefully, "I assumed you'd been completely removed from the business world."

"She was Henry's brightest student!" William interjected proudly. "There was a time when Liam—" He caught himself abruptly, coughing into his hand before redirecting. "Henry intended for Olivia to take over the family enterprises!"

Olivia's eyes widened in surprise. This revelation was news to her, but William quickly steered the conversation elsewhere.

"Regardless, Olivia, we'd be honored to have you as our advisor," William said earnestly, his gaze intent. "What do you say?"

Olivia shook her head gently, offering William a warm but regretful smile.

She gestured her need for time to consider, explaining there were personal matters requiring careful deliberation.

The unspoken truth hung heavily in the air. Liam's insistence on her domestic confinement complicated matters. Her current arrangement at Gregory's studio provided necessary flexibility. Accepting this formal position would undoubtedly provoke Liam's wrath and potentially strain relations with the Whitmore family.

Alexander raised his glass in understanding. "If my earlier demeanor influenced your hesitation, please accept my sincere apologies—"

Olivia shook her head emphatically, assuring them his behavior wasn't the issue.

Fidgeting with her napkin, she reluctantly confessed her family obligations might prevent her acceptance.

Comprehension dawned on their faces, followed by weighted silence.

Liam's infidelity with Evelyn, along with his other rumored affairs, was common knowledge in their circles. Their silent sympathy for Olivia - the generous, long-suffering wife - was palpable.

As Olivia hinted at Liam's restrictions, disapproval flickered across their expressions. Yet they knew better than to interfere in marital matters. William sighed before making his final offer. "Ten million annual salary, three-year minimum contract. Olivia, when you've reached your decision, contact either Alexander or myself. The position remains open for you."

Leaving the restaurant later, Olivia felt as though she walked through a dream. Twenty million within a year - enough to secure her freedom from Liam's control.

Previously, such wealth had seemed an impossible fantasy. Now, destiny had handed her the key to liberation. She'd underestimated her own worth all these years.

Henry had personally trained her in business strategy, ensuring his mute protégé could navigate the cutthroat world of antiquities. How bitterly ironic that she'd chosen domestic confinement to please Liam, squandering her mentor's faith in the process.

The evening's events replayed in her mind, sparking a long-dormant sense of possibility.

Perhaps she wasn't destined to remain "Liam's worthless wife" forever. If given the chance, she could prove her capabilities to the world.

These hopeful thoughts carried her to the car, where Theodore waited with visible anxiety. "Madam, Mr. Blackwood has called four times inquiring about your whereabouts," he reported urgently.

Two hours at dinner meant Liam had checked on her every thirty minutes.

Olivia's body tensed, dread pooling in her stomach.
###Chapter 48

The sleek black sedan came to a smooth stop at the gated entrance of the Newport estate. Through the wrought iron gates, Olivia could see warm golden light spilling from the floor-to-ceiling windows. She stepped out quickly, her heels clicking against the cobblestone driveway as she hurried inside.

Liam sat at the grand dining table, his piercing gaze locking onto her the moment she entered.

A crystal wine glass half-filled with deep crimson liquid stood before him. The elaborate meal prepared by their private chef remained untouched on fine china. Olivia froze, suddenly transported back to countless lonely nights during their marriage when she'd waited with cooling dinners, only for Liam never to come home.

Now the roles were reversed. The irony wasn't lost on her.

"Out enjoying the nightlife?" Liam's voice cut through the silence as he noticed her hesitation.

Olivia sighed, gesturing vaguely that William had invited her to dinner and she'd assumed he knew.

"Assumed?" Liam's voice dripped with sarcasm. The temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees. "So your assumption excused you from basic courtesy?"

When he suddenly pushed back his chair, Olivia instinctively retreated a step. The loud crash of the overturned chair made her flinch. She wasn't accustomed to this version of Liam - the one who actually came home - and it unsettled her.

"I didn't expect you to be here," she admitted quietly. "You're rarely home to notice whether I've eaten or not."

Liam's jaw tightened visibly. "Is that a complaint?"

Olivia shook her head, eyes downcast. "Just stating facts." She closed her eyes briefly, whether to compose herself or hide her emotions, she wasn't sure.

To her surprise, Liam didn't advance. Instead, he stalked to the liquor cabinet, selected an expensive bottle, and poured himself another drink in silence. Olivia hesitated, then took a tentative step forward. The words "don't drink so much" hovered on her lips, along with the impulse to fetch him some milk to soothe his stomach.

But she stopped herself. Liam didn't want her mothering. His anger stemmed from her defiance, nothing more. If playing the docile wife would keep the peace, so be it. With a quiet sigh, she turned and ascended the staircase without another word.

The next morning found Olivia not at her design studio, but at an upscale café near her home meeting Natalie. Since the bookstore fire, this had become their usual spot.

"Still on the mineral water diet, I see?" Natalie teased as she ordered an $88 bottle of imported water for Olivia. "Don't even think about complaining about the price!"

Olivia took a sip and sighed. "Tastes exactly like tap water." She swirled the glass absently. "How have you been?"

Natalie leaned forward, eyes bright with curiosity. "What's this big opportunity you mentioned?"

Olivia took a deep breath and explained William's offer to become a design consultant for Whitmore Holdings.

"That's incredible!" Natalie nearly knocked over her coffee in excitement. "Why are you hesitating? This is a thousand times better than that bookstore!"

Olivia's fingers tightened around her water glass. "There's something else." She warned Natalie to keep calm before revealing the deteriorating state of her marriage and her decision to file for divorce.

"Twenty million? Is he insane?" Natalie's voice rose sharply when she heard Liam's demands. She shot to her feet, ready to storm Blackwood Enterprises that instant.

Olivia grabbed her wrist. "Please, sit down. Everyone's staring."

"How can I sit?" Natalie hissed, though she allowed herself to be pulled back into her seat. "First he cheats, now he wants alimony? The man has no shame!" Her outburst drew several curious glances from nearby patrons.

Olivia pushed the iced coffee toward her friend. "Drink. Cool down."

"That absolute bastard," Natalie muttered darkly into her glass.

Olivia traced the condensation on her own glass. "I think...he resented his grandfather forcing him to marry me. Now that I'm the one initiating divorce..."

"You're still making excuses for him?" Natalie interrupted. "He's a grown man. No one held a gun to his head. Does Blackwood Enterprises really need your twenty million? This is pure spite!"

Olivia frowned. "What would you have me do?"

Natalie exhaled sharply, finally admitting defeat. "Legally, you're screwed. Even with his infidelity, the Blackwood legal team would crush you in court." She drummed her fingers on the table. "Here's an idea - take William's offer. Get the first ten million from the contract, and I'll help raise the other ten. Your freedom is worth it, even if that bastard doesn't deserve a penny."

Olivia's eyes widened. "Natalie, the market's terrible right now. Your family can't spare that kind of money."

Before Natalie could respond, a familiar honeyed voice cut through the café's murmur. "Well, well. Fancy meeting you here. Who exactly are you calling a bastard? Surely not dear Liam?"

Olivia turned slowly to face the smirking Evelyn Hartley.
###Chapter 49

"Look who decided to show up - the queen of manipulation herself!" Natalie scoffed as Evelyn appeared, her perfectly manicured fingers tightening around her coffee cup.

Evelyn's flawless smile faltered for just a second before she regained composure. She slid into the booth with practiced grace, her designer purse landing with a soft thud beside Olivia. "I couldn't help overhearing your little chat. Olivia, darling, is it true you're leaving Liam?"

"Which part of 'private conversation' don't you understand? Or are you just that desperate to insert yourself where you don't belong?" Natalie shot back, her eyes flashing with irritation.

Olivia felt her pulse quicken. How much had Evelyn actually heard? And more importantly - how had Liam shared something so personal with her already?

Evelyn leaned forward, her voice dripping with false concern. "You've already served him divorce papers, haven't you?"

The confirmation stung. Of course Liam would run straight to Evelyn with their marital problems. Those two had no boundaries. But having Evelyn confront her about it? That was a new low.

"You really shouldn't go through with it," Evelyn continued smoothly.

Natalie nearly choked on her latte. "Excuse me? Who asked for your opinion? Get lost!"

Ignoring Natalie's outburst, Evelyn kept her predatory gaze locked on Olivia. "I heard you're doing this for my sake. How noble. But darling, I don't need your charity. I've always gotten exactly what I wanted without anyone's help."

The truth in her words burned. Everyone knew how much Liam spoiled Evelyn.

"And you," Evelyn's manicured nail tapped the table pointedly, "haven't touched a cent of his fortune. So why the sudden change of heart?"

Natalie opened her mouth to protest, but Olivia was quicker. Her fingers flew across her phone screen before turning it toward Evelyn. "Even if I leave him, the Blackwoods would never accept you. Not with your... reputation."

The unspoken word - mistress - hung heavy between them. Evelyn wore the title like a badge of honor in their circles, but Olivia knew the truth. The Blackwoods valued pedigree above all else.

Evelyn's smile turned brittle as she read the message.

Olivia typed again, her fingers steady despite the pounding in her chest. "And when they arrange Liam's next marriage? His new wife won't be as tolerant as I've been."

The barb hit its mark. Evelyn's carefully constructed mask slipped, revealing the venom beneath. "You think you'll fare better? At least I have his heart!"

Unfazed, Olivia typed her final blow. "Don't worry about me. I'll always be Henry Winslow's beloved granddaughter."

Evelyn's nostrils flared. Before she could retort, Natalie snatched up a water glass. "Last warning, Hartley. Get out before I redecorate your designer dress."

"You wouldn't dare!" Evelyn scrambled up so fast her chair screeched across the floor. With one last venomous glare, she stormed out, her stilettos clicking angrily against the tile.

Natalie turned to Olivia, eyes wide. "How the hell did she find out? Did Liam really tell her everything?"

Olivia exhaled slowly. She hadn't expected Evelyn to take the bait so easily. The truth was far more complicated - as the current head of Blackwood Enterprises, Liam could marry whomever he pleased. The family's objections wouldn't stop him if he truly wanted Evelyn.

Apparently, Evelyn didn't know that. Or maybe her insecurities ran deeper than Olivia realized.

"Olivia, listen to me," Natalie said gently, reaching across the table. "This decision is yours alone. Don't let anyone - not Liam, not Evelyn - pressure you into anything."

The sudden ringing of Olivia's phone cut through the moment. Ryan Carter's name flashed on the screen - she'd saved his number during her last hospital visit. Why was he calling now?

Her blood ran cold the second she answered. "Mrs. Blackwood, you need to come to Mercy Hospital immediately. Liam collapsed. We're running tests now."

Collapsed? The same mysterious illness that had claimed Henry's life? The thought sent Olivia bolting from her seat, her coffee forgotten.

"Olivia! What's wrong?" Natalie called after her.

But Olivia was already halfway to the door, frantically signaling for her driver. "Mercy Hospital. Now." Her voice shook as the car peeled away from the curb.

She practically tumbled out before the car fully stopped at the emergency entrance, sprinting through the automatic doors. Ryan's text guided her to the correct floor, each step heavier than the last. The possibility of losing Liam - really losing him - made her chest constrict painfully.

She burst into the private suite, her breath coming in ragged gasps, only to freeze in the doorway.

There sat Liam, perfectly alert in his hospital gown, frowning at a tablet balanced on his knees. He looked up at her sudden entrance, his eyebrows lifting in surprise at her disheveled appearance.

"Someone's eager to see her husband," Ryan teased from behind her, his smirk audible. "I'd say this qualifies as true love - rushing here in record time."

Olivia's cheeks burned as she stood rooted to the spot, suddenly aware of how her frantic dash might be misinterpreted. Especially by the man currently studying her with an unreadable expression.

The realization hit her like a bucket of ice water - she'd just revealed far more than she'd intended.
###Chapter 50

Olivia froze at the hospital room's threshold, her fingers tightening around the doorframe.

"Planning to stand there all day?" Ryan Carter's sharp voice cut through her hesitation as he brushed past her into Liam Blackwood's room.

Her cheeks burned as she finally stepped inside, realizing how foolish she must have looked hovering in the doorway. She'd imagined Liam on death's door, not simply exhausted from overwork.

"He collapsed during a board meeting," Ryan explained while adjusting the IV drip with practiced efficiency. His tone was professional, yet Olivia detected genuine concern beneath the clinical words. "His assistant rushed him here immediately."

Ryan shot Liam an exasperated look. "Skipped breakfast, lived on espresso shots, then chose red wine over lunch. What did you expect would happen?"

Olivia's heart clenched at the sight of Liam's ashen complexion. She'd hired personal chefs and nutritionists for their household, yet he still neglected his own wellbeing.

She schooled her features into careful neutrality, giving Ryan a tight nod.

"Mrs. Blackwood," Ryan continued, "since our patient refuses hospital food, perhaps you could bring him something edible? He's notoriously picky."

Liam's glare could have frozen lava. "Have you tasted the slop they serve here?"

"I eat it daily," Ryan countered with a smirk before turning back to Olivia. "Would that be possible?"

Olivia's quick nod belied the turmoil inside her.

Leaving the hospital, Olivia's legs nearly gave way as relief flooded through her. Liam wasn't seriously ill - just pushed himself too hard, as usual.

In the car, she texted Natalie Bennett, explaining Liam's condition and her decision to postpone the divorce discussion. She couldn't possibly bring it up while he was hospitalized, could she? The thought of how Henry Winslow would react if he were still alive made her stomach twist.

The reply took longer than expected. When it came, Olivia could practically hear Natalie's sigh through the screen.

"This isn't your responsibility," Natalie wrote. "If he valued family, if he appreciated all those mornings you woke at dawn to cook for him, maybe he wouldn't be in this situation. Olivia, stop blaming yourself. Whatever you decide is valid. Don't carry this weight alone."

Natalie's unwavering support warmed Olivia's heart. She always knew exactly what to say.

At home, Olivia moved with purpose straight to the kitchen. The culinary team had prepped dinner ingredients, awaiting her instructions. Selecting three recipes from memory, she set to work alongside the professional chefs.

Early in their marriage, Liam had claimed to love her cooking. If his tastes had changed, the chefs' dishes would suffice.

Within the hour, Olivia packed the carefully prepared meals into insulated containers and returned to the hospital.

But as she approached Liam's room, she collided with Evelyn Hartley.

Their eyes locked in silent battle before Evelyn deliberately shouldered past her into the room.

"Liam darling," Evelyn cooed, placing an elaborate takeout bag on the bedside table. "I brought dinner from Le Ciel. Sebastian opened the kitchen early just for you." She shot Olivia a triumphant look. "Professional cuisine beats amateur efforts any day."

Evelyn produced a box of exotic fruits with a flourish. "Fresh from Thailand this morning."

Olivia stood frozen in the doorway, the homemade meal suddenly feeling inadequate in her hands.

All her careful preparation seemed foolish compared to Evelyn's effortless extravagance. One phone call had secured what Olivia had labored over for hours.

"What's that chemical stench?" Ryan's voice cut through the tension as he entered with medical supplies.

He wrinkled his nose at Evelyn's takeout. "How many artificial additives did they pump into this? Trying to poison my patient?"

Evelyn's smile faltered. "Liam loves this restaurant—"

Ryan wasn't finished. "And that perfume! We should post signs: 'Fragrance-Free Zone - No Pollution Allowed!'" He waved a hand dramatically. "Take this chemical warfare elsewhere, please."

Evelyn turned pleading eyes to Liam, who remained impassive. "Do as the doctor says."

"Exactly," Ryan agreed, adjusting Liam's IV with unnecessary force. "Oops! Needle's in your dominant hand now. Guess you'll need help eating."

Liam's icy stare could have shattered glass. "Oops?"

"Long shift," Ryan said unrepentantly before turning to Olivia. "Since you're here, Mrs. Blackwood, perhaps you could assist your husband? My hands are tied now."

Feed Liam? Olivia's cheeks burned as the implication sank in. The thought of sitting so close, of feeding him bite by bite...

Her pulse hammered in her throat.
###Chapter 51

"What's with the frozen stance? The patient needs to eat! I'm heading out for dinner myself. Just hit the call button if you need anything." With that casual remark, Ryan turned on his heel and exited, the door clicking shut behind him.

Olivia carefully unpacked the meal containers from the insulated bag, arranging them precisely on Liam's bedside table. Her movements were hesitant, betraying how unaccustomed she was to tending to Liam with such care.

As she removed the lids while standing beside him, Liam's firm voice interrupted. "Sit down." His hand gently tugged her wrist, pulling her onto the edge of the hospital bed. "Why are you hovering like hired help?"

Olivia avoided his gaze, wondering if in his eyes, she truly wasn't much different from staff. She picked up a spoon, carefully blew on a bite of food to cool it, and tentatively raised it toward Liam's lips.

Their proximity brought back vivid memories of Liam's mouth claiming hers. Her hand trembled, sending the spoon's contents tumbling onto the crisp white sheets.

Flustered, Olivia gestured an apology and jumped up to clean the spill. Knowing Liam's notorious standards for cleanliness, she braced for his irritation.

Instead, Liam calmly grabbed a tissue, scooped up the fallen food, and tossed it away. "We'll deal with that after I finish eating."

Olivia nodded and cautiously resumed her seat.

"These two dishes are excellent, and this one's decent. You can put the others away - I won't touch them." Liam's comment made Olivia's lips curve slightly. The dishes he'd praised were the ones she'd prepared herself, not the chef's creations.

"Aren't you hungry?" Liam asked mid-meal.

It was indeed dinner time, and Olivia's stomach growled after all her bustling about. Still, she shook her head.

"Eat with me," Liam suggested.

Olivia's cheeks warmed. She'd only brought one set of utensils, having focused entirely on Liam's needs. Now sharing his fork seemed too intimate - surely he'd find it unhygienic. She shook her head again, indicating she'd eat later.

Liam studied her but let the matter drop.

After dinner, Olivia efficiently cleared away the dishes.

Ryan returned shortly after, now in casual clothes instead of his white coat. "My shift's over!"

"You came all this way to announce that?" Liam's skeptical eyebrow arched.

"Thoughtful of me, right?" Ryan's lips quirked. "But wait - there's more. Major hospital inspection means all family cots are being used. Looks like Mrs. Blackwood gets to share your bed tonight."

Olivia's eyes widened in shock. A Blackwood Enterprises hospital, out of spare beds?

Liam chuckled darkly. "Really? Who do you take me for?"

Ryan adopted an exaggerated serious expression. "Why would I lie? Want me to fetch the administrator with the inspection notice? Honestly, what would I gain from making this up?"

With a dismissive snort, Liam waved Ryan away.

Having delivered his message, Ryan exited without further ado.

Left alone, Olivia lingered awkwardly by the bed. The private room contained only the hospital bed and a small sofa. She gestured toward the sofa, indicating she'd keep watch from there.

Liam, connected to monitors but clearly stable, frowned. "I'm not at death's door. Why would you need to keep watch?"

His expression shifted between annoyance and amusement. "Just sleep here."

While the hospital bed was wider than standard, it remained designed for one person.

With Liam's injuries posing no obstacle to sharing the space, there was no physical reason they couldn't sleep side by side.

Yet the idea made Olivia's pulse race. Though they'd been physically intimate, they'd never actually slept entwined. Hesitating, she tentatively suggested going home instead.

"Now you're not concerned about me? Weren't you just offering to keep watch?" Liam's voice carried an edge of frustration.

Seeing no alternative, Olivia nervously fiddled with her sleeve and proposed summoning Evelyn for company.

In Olivia's mind, it seemed more appropriate for Evelyn to share Liam's bed. Evelyn had seemed genuinely upset when Ryan dismissed her earlier, and Olivia assumed Liam might want to comfort her.

But at this suggestion, Liam's expression darkened. "You're that eager to leave me?"

Olivia lowered her gaze, too apprehensive to respond. She wanted to stay, yet feared Liam didn't truly want her there.

Watching her conflicted expression, Liam tapped the mattress twice. "Sleep here. I won't ask again."
###Chapter 52

The hospital bed felt impossibly small as Olivia Sinclair curled up beside Liam Blackwood. She pressed herself against the edge, making herself as compact as possible to avoid touching him.

Olivia turned her back to Liam, but his body heat still radiated against her. The faint brush of his muscular frame and the cold press of monitor wires against her spine made sleep difficult.

She squeezed her eyes shut, willing herself to relax. Exhaustion from the day's events finally pulled her toward sleep.

Then movement. Liam shifted behind her, removing the tangled wires before wrapping an arm around her waist. His chest pressed against her back, his warm breath tickling her neck. Olivia froze.

But he did nothing more. His breathing soon steadied into sleep's rhythm.

When Olivia tried adjusting her position, Liam's sleep-rough voice stopped her. "Stop moving. Hospital bed. Remember?"

Olivia held perfectly still, barely daring to breathe. She didn't remember falling asleep, but a sharp noise jolted her awake.

The door clicked open. Stiletto heels tapped across the floor. Then a shriek.

Olivia jerked upright, only to be pulled back down by Liam's unyielding arm.

Evelyn Hartley stood frozen in the doorway, breakfast tray nearly slipping from her fingers. "You two—?" Her eyes widened in horrified disbelief.

"Must you be so loud?" Liam growled as he sat up slowly, irritation lining his voice.

Olivia scrambled from the bed, flushing when she noticed several shirt buttons had come undone. Her fumbling attempts to fasten them only seemed to fuel Evelyn's rage.

Evelyn approached cautiously, clearly restraining herself in Liam's presence. "I brought breakfast, but I certainly didn't expect to find—"

"No spare beds last night," Liam said dismissively. "She slept here."

Olivia's heart twisted. She was Liam's wife, yet here they were, explaining their intimacy to his mistress.

The nurse entered with a blood draw cart. "After we take samples, you can eat."

Olivia stepped aside while Evelyn remained silent.

"Everything looks stable," the nurse said after checking the overnight heart monitor readings. "Just need those numbers to stay consistent for full recovery."

"Stay consistent?" The words echoed ominously in Evelyn's mind. What had they done last night to cause instability? This was supposed to be a healing space!

Evelyn's nails bit into her palms. After years with Liam, she'd never gotten this close. How did this mute nobody deserve such intimacy?

"Breakfast time," the nurse announced before leaving, the door clicking shut behind her.

"Liam, I brought your favorite porridge," Evelyn said, arranging a small table with practiced elegance that made Olivia feel clumsy in comparison.

Steam rose from the opened thermos, but the aroma wasn't appetizing. "From that place you love. I convinced them to open early just for you. Chef Sebastian personally prepared it—far better than anything homemade." Her pointed glance at Olivia dripped with condescension.

"And I brought imported fruit," Evelyn added, smirking at Olivia's homemade meal.

Standing by the door, food container in hand, Olivia felt like an intruder in her own marriage. Her hours of careful cooking paled against Evelyn's effortless extravagance.

"What's that smell?" Ryan Carter's voice cut through the room as he entered with IV supplies. His nose wrinkled at the thermos's contents. "How many artificial flavors are in that?"

Ryan's disapproving gaze landed on Evelyn. "Trying to poison my patient?"

Evelyn faltered, looking to Liam for support. "It's from your favorite—"

Before she could finish, Ryan's attention shifted to her perfume. "Are you trying to gas us all? They should post signs: 'No Perfume Allowed! Oxygen Zone!'"

His nose wrinkled in disgust. "Take that stuff and leave. Please."

Evelyn turned pleading eyes to Liam, who remained impassive. "Listen to the doctor," he said flatly.

"Exactly," Ryan added. "Doctor's orders trump mistresses."

As Evelyn stormed out, her glare promised Olivia would pay for this humiliation.

"All done," Ryan announced cheerfully as he finished Liam's IV. Then with exaggerated surprise: "Oh no! Needle's in your right hand. Guess you'll need help eating today."

Liam's icy stare could have frozen lava. "Mistake?"

"Long shift. Tired hands," Ryan said without remorse. Then to Olivia: "Since you're here, Mrs. Blackwood, why don't you feed your husband? Can't exactly re-stick him now."

Feed Liam? Olivia's cheeks burned as she stood frozen.
###Chapter 53

Olivia's silent glance nearly pushed Evelyn over the edge. Evelyn had always carried herself with an air of superiority around Olivia. Now, her fury was visible, yet she held back, refusing to break down in Liam's presence.

"Have you eaten?" The door swung open suddenly as Ryan entered, wiping his mouth.

Liam gave Ryan a look of mild disgust. "What's with that face? I left breakfast early to check on you. Doesn't that count for something?" Ryan wiped his greasy hands on his white coat. "Time for your tests!"

Olivia frowned, certain Liam had completed all required examinations. Ryan explained, "We need a comprehensive brain scan today to rule out potential complications. Yesterday's tests only eliminated immediate concerns."

The shadow of the hereditary brain condition that had claimed Henry loomed large. Though Liam showed no current symptoms, the future remained uncertain. The thought of illness claiming him made Olivia's heart clench. She tried to push away the dread, clasping her hands in silent prayer.

Liam, unaware of Olivia's quiet plea, stood and followed Ryan. Evelyn caught Olivia's gesture and scoffed, dismissing it as juvenile. "Need a wheelchair?" Ryan joked as they walked down the hallway. "You're outpacing me, and you're the patient!"

"I've got work waiting," Liam replied sharply. "Projects can't wait."

"Typical you," Ryan shot back. "Always pushing too hard. No wonder you collapsed." Liam entered the examination room.

"The detailed scan will take about thirty minutes," Ryan told Olivia. "You can wait somewhere comfortable."

Olivia nodded silently. Restless, she chose to wait just outside, her nervous energy evident as she paced the corridor.

Evelyn joined Olivia, radiating calm arrogance. She sneered. "Stop pretending. Who are you trying to fool?"

Olivia met Evelyn's gaze with icy clarity, her eyes conveying what words couldn't - that Evelyn, merely the mistress, could never understand.

Infuriated by the silent rebuke, Evelyn stepped closer, voice tight. "I should be the worried one! What happens to me if something happens to Liam? You'll still have your fortune regardless."

Olivia pulled out her phone. "Arguing with me? I'm stating facts. Even if Liam wanted to leave you anything, his family would never allow it. As his mistress, you'll always come first. Who's fooling whom?"

Instead of responding, Olivia typed a message and showed Evelyn the screen: "Would you dare say this where Liam could hear? Speculating about his death and inheritance - I'm sure he'd find that fascinating."

Evelyn's expression darkened. "You know nothing! Even if you told him, he wouldn't believe you!"

Olivia smiled slightly and typed another message: "I recorded it."

Those three words ignited Evelyn. She lunged for Olivia's phone, but Olivia clutched it to her chest. "Recorded it? How cruel! What do you gain by turning on me?" Evelyn's accusations hung in the air as the doctor's office door opened.

"What's going on here?" Ryan demanded, frowning at Evelyn. "This is a hospital, not a battleground."

Everyone knew Ryan favored Olivia, so Evelyn expected no sympathy. She retreated slightly, muttering, "Just joking around."

Ryan pointed upward. "Cameras everywhere," he stated, making clear Evelyn's intentions weren't hers to define.

"You—" Evelyn shot Ryan a venomous look.

"Family should wait outside. Anything else you need? This is a restricted area," Ryan added firmly.

Evelyn clenched her teeth, threw Olivia a threatening glare, and stormed off.

Moments later, Liam emerged from the examination room, and Olivia hurried to him. "All clear. No need to worry," Ryan said, holding the report while addressing Olivia.

Olivia exhaled in relief. "Thanks," Liam said, his gaze shifting to Olivia. She blinked in surprise - she hadn't expected gratitude from Liam.

Ryan chuckled. "No need to be formal with your wife." He clapped Liam's shoulder. "You'll be relying on her more now. No skipped meals, no overworking. Mrs. Blackwood, could you start bringing your husband lunch?"

Olivia nodded eagerly. She'd tried before, only to be turned away at Blackwood Enterprises' entrance.

"Bring me lunch?" Liam looked at Olivia, amusement in his voice. "Shouldn't I be bringing you meals?"

Olivia flushed, remembering when Liam had brought her lunch after she'd skipped meals. She glanced at him hesitantly, gesturing whether she could now bring him lunch to the office. Previously, receptionists hadn't even recognized her as his wife. Would that change?

Liam met her gaze but hesitated to respond, his thoughts unreadable. Olivia's heart sank slightly. Perhaps he still preferred Evelyn's care...
###Chapter 54

"You're welcome to bring me lunch, as long as it doesn't interfere with your studio schedule," Liam remarked, pausing briefly.

Olivia's cheeks flushed deeper as she quickly signaled that she would skip her studio visits for a few days—bringing him lunch was far more important to her.

Liam didn’t comment on her promise before turning to leave. His assistant had already prepared fresh clothes, and a car waited downstairs. Soon, he was on his way to Blackwood Enterprises for the day’s work.

Meanwhile, Olivia returned home and messaged Marcus, explaining that a family member was ill and she wouldn’t be able to visit the studio for a while.

Then, she headed to the kitchen to prepare lunch for Liam. Judging by his reaction the day before, he seemed to prefer her cooking.

A faint smile touched her lips at the thought, but it vanished just as quickly. What did it matter if he liked her food? He didn’t love her. He didn’t want her as his wife. She was just an afterthought in his life.

Now, her role had been reduced to that of a housekeeper—someone to cook and serve meals. Liam wouldn’t thank her. Instead, he’d dismiss her efforts with a detached, "Well done," as if she were just another employee.

Her fingers felt sluggish as she handled the ingredients, longing for the scent of her studio, where she could lose herself in restoring antiques, untouched by the complications of her personal life.

With a bitter laugh, she gestured for the kitchen staff to handle the chopping. Initially, she had planned to do everything herself, but she reconsidered. She would focus on the finishing touches instead.

Once lunch was ready, the driver escorted Olivia to Blackwood Enterprises. On the way, she texted Liam to let him know she was coming, but there was no reply. Doubt crept in. Had he even seen her message? If not, she might be turned away at the lobby again, left to endure the receptionist’s scrutinizing gaze.

As she stepped into the building, the same receptionist from before greeted her with a mix of recognition and thinly veiled disdain.

"Here to see Mr. Blackwood again? With lunch, I assume?" the receptionist asked, skepticism lacing her tone.

Olivia simply nodded.

The receptionist eyed her with contempt. From their last encounter, it was clear Liam knew Olivia, but his demeanor hadn’t been particularly warm.

She quickly concluded Olivia wasn’t important.

After a moment, the receptionist offered a cold smile. "If you're struggling with mental health issues, I suggest seeking help. If you continue disrupting our operations, we may have to involve the authorities."

Olivia, expecting this, calmly pulled out her phone and showed the text exchange with Liam.

The receptionist barely glanced at it before scoffing. "You expect me to believe that’s Mr. Blackwood’s number? If I accepted every random screenshot, I’d have to let anyone in."

With a quiet sigh, Olivia considered her next move. She decided to call Liam. If he didn’t answer, she would leave. Maybe he’d forgotten her promise—or maybe he was with Evelyn and ignoring his phone.

Just as she was about to dial, the elevator doors opened, and a sharply dressed man strode out.

"Mr. Montgomery!" The receptionist straightened immediately, her tone deferential.

As Liam’s top assistant, Sebastian Montgomery held more authority than most vice presidents. He approached Olivia with purpose.

"Madam," he said with a slight nod. "Mr. Blackwood asked me to escort you upstairs."

Relief washed over Olivia, and she gestured her thanks.

The receptionist gaped, stunned. She hadn’t expected Olivia to warrant such treatment. Normally, only high-profile clients were greeted by managers—let alone Sebastian, who usually only acknowledged CEOs of partner companies. Why would someone like him be here for a lunch delivery?

"Were you delayed here?" Sebastian asked Olivia, his tone gentle but firm as he prepared to guide her upstairs.

Terrified, the receptionist stammered, "I—I didn’t realize who she was, and last time Mr. Blackwood—"

"Didn’t you check the notification?" Sebastian cut in sharply.

"I—I haven’t had the chance—"

"It was sent three hours ago. You still haven’t seen it?" His displeasure was palpable.

Caught, the receptionist fumbled for her phone and found the company-wide notice. It clearly stated that a mute visitor named Olivia was expected and should be granted direct access to the CEO’s office.

Realization dawned on Olivia. Liam had arranged everything in advance. He hadn’t forgotten.

"I—I wasn’t feeling well today, so I didn’t check—"

"You’ve neglected your duties," Sebastian said coldly. "Report to HR and submit your resignation."

Without another word, he led Olivia to the elevator.

As they ascended, Olivia took in her surroundings. This was her first glimpse of Liam’s workplace.

The 17th floor buzzed with energy. One side housed a glass-walled secretarial hub, where employees worked diligently. Nearby, a well-stocked pantry and cozy lounge offered a brief escape from the office bustle. Opposite it was Liam’s office, its door closed, a quiet contrast to the floor’s lively rhythm.

"Madam, please wait here. Mr. Blackwood is in a video conference," Sebastian informed her as they reached the lounge.

Olivia nodded and sat. The lounge was framed by floor-to-ceiling windows, offering a breathtaking view of the city. She pulled out her phone and began snapping photos.

"Oh, is that her?" two secretaries whispered as they entered.

Engrossed, Olivia didn’t notice them at first. When they neared, she looked up and smiled warmly.

They returned polite smiles before moving past her to the water dispenser.

"She’s even more stunning than in the photo. I’d recognize her anywhere!" one murmured.

"I thought that notice picture was edited," the other mused skeptically.

Olivia blinked, realizing they were discussing her—likely assuming she couldn’t hear or speak.

Just as she considered leaving to avoid further awkwardness, another snippet caught her attention.

"She’s way prettier than Miss Hartley. Do you think Evelyn’s days are numbered?"

"No chance. Evelyn’s the queen of drama. She knows how to keep his attention. She’s not going anywhere."

A chill ran through Olivia. Evelyn was clearly well-known here.

She took a steadying breath. Her mission was simple: deliver lunch and maintain her composure, no matter the undercurrents of tension.

As the secretaries walked away, Olivia refocused on her phone, ensuring she had a clear path to Liam’s office. She wouldn’t let Evelyn’s shadow shake her resolve.

With one last glance around the bustling lounge, she stood and made her way toward Liam’s office, ready to fulfill her promise—no matter what lay ahead.
###Chapter 55

Olivia's curiosity had been piqued. She abandoned all thought of leaving, eager to catch more of the secretaries' conversation. Just as she settled in to listen, their discussion halted abruptly. The sharp click of approaching footsteps changed the atmosphere instantly, and Liam appeared in the lounge doorway.

"Mr. Blackwood!" The two secretaries gasped simultaneously, their voices laced with equal parts respect and alarm as they scrambled to greet him.

Liam acknowledged them with a curt nod before his gaze landed on Olivia. "Why didn't you come in?"

Olivia rose quickly, explaining that Sebastian had mentioned Liam was in a meeting and she hadn't wanted to interrupt.

"Even during meetings, you're always welcome," Liam stated firmly.

Olivia nodded, picking up the food container she'd set aside earlier. Without another word, Liam turned and left, his departure plunging the lounge into sudden silence. The secretaries exchanged panicked looks, realizing Olivia might have overheard their entire conversation about her and Liam's unusual relationship. Their faces paled at the thought she might report them.

But Olivia simply offered them a reassuring smile. As she gathered her things, a thought struck her. Pausing, she typed a message on her phone and showed it to them: "Does Evelyn often spend private time with Mr. Blackwood in his office?"

The secretaries hesitated before one finally answered, "Not frequently, but there are afternoons when they're alone for hours... and when they emerge..." She trailed off meaningfully.

The implication was clear - something intimate was happening between Evelyn and Liam behind closed doors. Olivia typed another message: "Thank you. Don't worry - I heard nothing today."

Relief washed over the secretaries' faces as they realized Olivia wouldn't cause trouble for them. Turning toward Liam's office, Olivia felt a sudden pang of regret. Why had she even asked? The answer only deepened the ache in her heart.

Liam's office was spacious and impersonal, showing no signs of feminine influence. Holding the food container, Olivia felt momentarily lost until Liam instructed, "Sit on the couch."

She set the container down and had just settled when a knock interrupted them. A male employee entered with documents. "Mr. Blackwood, these require your signature."

"Let me see," Liam said, taking the papers. He seemed more focused on reviewing them than eating. Olivia didn't open the container yet, wanting to keep the food warm. Meanwhile, the employee lingered, casting curious glances at Olivia.

Unaware of her identity - only receptionists and secretaries had seen her photo - the employee assumed she was domestic staff. In a condescending tone, he warned, "Be careful not to spill anything. We can't have stains when Mr. Blackwood has guests."

He nodded smugly, believing he'd prevented a disaster. But Liam's reaction was immediate and icy. His glare sent a visible shiver through the man.

"You don't speak to her that way," Liam said coldly. "Apologize. Now."

"My deepest apologies!" The employee stammered, sweat beading on his forehead. Liam's frosty demeanor often preceded severe consequences, and he feared for his job. Olivia was stunned. She hadn't expected Liam to defend her over something so trivial. The employee's remark, while rude, hadn't been harmful - yet Liam's reaction spoke volumes about his regard for her.

"Don't return to this floor," Liam ordered after signing the documents, flinging the folder back. The employee practically ran from the room, relieved to still be employed.

As Liam turned his attention to lunch, the office door burst open. "Liam! Why didn't anyone tell me you were ill? I had to hear it from the hospital!"

Margaret Winslow, Liam's mother, stormed in, her presence commanding immediate attention. Olivia instinctively stepped back as Margaret's sharp eyes assessed the scene.

"Are you the one looking after my son?" Margaret's voice cut through the air, her gaze flickering between Olivia and the unopened food container. "Can't even manage to serve a meal properly? At this rate, Liam might as well cook for himself!"

"She was waiting so the food wouldn't get cold," Liam interjected, sitting down. Margaret's eyebrows shot up at his defense of Olivia, her disapproval evident.

Taking a seat opposite Liam, Margaret's tone shifted. "How are you feeling?"

"Fine. There was no need for you to come," Liam replied curtly, focusing on his meal.

"Well that's fortunate! With your brother unable to have children, if you fall ill too, the Blackwood lineage could end!" As she spoke, Margaret's gaze slid meaningfully toward Olivia. Her expression made it clear she didn't consider Olivia suitable to carry on the family name. Olivia kept her eyes down, pretending not to notice.

"Is that why you're here?" Liam finally looked up from his food, his question pointed.

"I'm here because I care about your health. Now eat," Margaret replied with a forced smile, conspicuously avoiding further heir talk. She remained until Liam finished eating, then rose to leave - with Olivia reluctantly following. Walking beside Margaret was the last thing Olivia wanted, but there was no polite escape.

In the elevator, Margaret's displeasure became physical. She grabbed Olivia's arm sharply.

"Olivia, I'm begging you," Margaret began, though her tone held more command than plea. "Liam isn't getting younger. The Blackwoods need heirs - multiple heirs. As his wife, any children from other women would be illegitimate!" She spat the word with disgust. "Henry raised you all those years, and you got your wish to marry Liam. Five years is enough. If you have any gratitude, you'll file for divorce immediately!"

Margaret's voice softened slightly, but the threat remained. "Think about Henry. How would he feel, watching from heaven knowing Liam has no heirs?"
###Chapter 56

Olivia lowered her gaze, surrendering to the moment without protest. She couldn't bring herself to confess to Margaret that she'd already mentioned divorce to Liam, only to face his stubborn rejection. Even if she had revealed this truth, Olivia knew Margaret would never believe her.

"Do you understand me? Just nod if you do! Honestly, look at yourself! Completely incompetent! How does the Blackwood family tolerate a daughter-in-law like you?" The entire elevator ride down, Margaret continued her relentless criticism, her voice dripping with disdain.

But the moment the doors opened, Margaret's demeanor transformed instantly. Her face smoothed into a practiced, polite smile as she greeted the lobby staff with perfect composure, playing the role of elegant matriarch flawlessly as they exited Blackwood Enterprises.

"Olivia?" A familiar voice called out as they stepped onto the sidewalk. Olivia turned to see Alexander approaching in a tailored suit, briefcase in hand.

She managed a quick wave and forced a smile, grateful for the distraction. She'd informed Gregory about her scheduling conflicts but hadn't yet told Alexander she couldn't accept the consultant position.

"Alexander!" Margaret's entire posture changed, her face lighting up with genuine delight at the sight of the Whitmore heir.

As the future leader of Whitmore Holdings, a company rivaling Blackwood Enterprises in prestige, Alexander commanded Margaret's automatic respect.

After exchanging pleasantries with Margaret, Alexander turned to Olivia. "Have you reached a decision yet? My grandfather is eagerly awaiting your answer."

"What's this about?" Margaret interrupted sharply, her suspicious gaze darting between them.

"Olivia possesses remarkable skills in artifact restoration," Alexander explained. "Our family wishes to retain her as a consultant."

"Olivia? How could she possibly—" Margaret began, her automatic reflex to belittle her daughter-in-law kicking in.

But Alexander cut her off smoothly. "Olivia has already demonstrated her expertise to my grandfather. He's quite insistent on having her join us."

Margaret's eyes widened in shock as she reassessed Olivia. William Whitmore was a respected figure whose opinion carried weight—even Margaret wouldn't dare contradict him openly. She bit back her usual insults about Olivia being "a worthless mute who can only cook."

Seizing the moment, Olivia typed on her phone: "I have personal matters requiring my attention, so I may not be able to commit to the consultant role." She carefully avoided mentioning Liam's illness, knowing how damaging such news could be to Blackwood Enterprises' reputation.

Though clearly disappointed, Alexander didn't press further. "When do you think you'll be available?"

Olivia shook her head uncertainly, typing: "I'm not sure."

While Liam's condition wasn't critical, Olivia didn't know how long she'd continue delivering his meals. He might grow tired of the arrangement tomorrow, or Evelyn might create problems that would force Olivia to stay away.

"Regardless, we'll keep the position open for you," Alexander stated firmly. "That's my grandfather's wish as well. Handle your priorities first, then contact us when you're ready."

Olivia felt both touched by the recognition and apprehensive about Margaret's newfound knowledge. "I should go now—I have afternoon commitments," Alexander said before departing.

The moment he was out of sight, Margaret's pleasant facade vanished. She pinched Olivia's arm sharply. "Why does Alexander treat you so well? Have you been seducing men behind our backs? Have you no shame?"

Olivia shook her head vehemently, but Margaret remained unmoved. This pattern had repeated for five years—no matter how Olivia tried to explain, Margaret never listened.

"If you dare flirt with another man again, I'll make sure Liam knows everything!" Margaret threatened as she turned back toward the building. "I'll show him your true colors! I'll make him divorce you and throw you out!"

Olivia stood motionless, watching Margaret retreat. She made no move to follow or stop her. The Blackwood Enterprises building buzzed with lunchtime activity, employees from nearby offices flooding the streets—hardly the place for a private confrontation with potential witnesses everywhere.

Realizing the potential damage to the family's reputation, Margaret suddenly stopped. She whirled back and grabbed Olivia's arm. "Since that's the case, you're coming home with me. You need to kneel and properly reflect on your behavior. You require discipline!"
###Chapter 57

Margaret Winslow yanked Olivia Sinclair toward her luxury sedan with brutal force, shoving her into the leather seat without care. Olivia could have resisted—every muscle in her body tensed for it—but she didn't. She assumed Theodore, the driver Liam Blackwood had assigned, must have seen everything from his parked car nearby. He'd likely drive off, powerless to intervene. Olivia stayed silent, her thoughts swirling like storm clouds.

Within minutes, they arrived at the Winslow estate. Margaret tapped her manicured nails against the window until a servant rushed to open her door. Stepping out, she lifted her chin with regal disdain, jabbing a finger toward Olivia. "Drag her to the grand hall! Make her kneel on the marble—and she stays there until I say otherwise!"

This mansion held too many memories of Olivia's suffering. Whether it was failing to brew Liam's tea perfectly or dusting the antique vases inadequately, Margaret always found excuses to punish her.

Now alone in the cavernous hall, Olivia knelt on the icy marble, the cold seeping through her thin dress. Margaret had ordered every cushion removed, ensuring the hard surface bit into her knees. Even hours later, the ache would linger like a ghost.

As twilight painted the windows gold, Olivia shifted slightly—just as the doors swung open. "What do you think you're doing?" Margaret's voice cracked like a whip. "Pretending to suffer for sympathy?"

Olivia shook her head mutely, but Margaret snapped her fingers at a maid. "Fetch my cane. This ungrateful wretch needs a reminder of her place." Ice flooded Olivia's veins. Only once in five years had Margaret resorted to physical violence—a beating so savage Olivia still woke gasping from nightmares of it.

The cane appeared, its polished surface gleaming. Margaret raised it high—but a hand caught her wrist mid-swing. The cane clattered to the floor, snapping in two.

Olivia looked up to see Liam standing there, his grip vise-like around his mother's arm. "Explain yourself," he demanded, voice low with fury.

"She was flirting with Alexander Hayes right in front of me!" Margaret spat. "Disgraceful behavior deserves discipline!"

Olivia's stomach dropped. Liam's trust in her had always been fragile. But then he said, "Alexander was discussing a job offer from Whitmore Holdings. Don't fabricate lies about Olivia."

Her eyes widened. How did he know? She'd never mentioned the offer, but of course Liam had ways of uncovering secrets. Theodore must have reported Alexander's visit.

"Are you planning to stand?" Liam's gaze burned into her.

Olivia staggered upright, her legs numb from hours on stone. She swayed—and Liam caught her, his arms wrapping firmly around her waist.

"Pathetic theatrics," Margaret sneered. "She's never this frail when you're not watching!"

"Has this happened before?" Liam's question was lethally quiet.

Margaret stiffened. "How else will she learn respect?"

Seeing Liam's darkening expression, she hastily changed tactics. "You're home early. Stay for dinner."

Liam ignored her, his attention fixed on Olivia's pale face. "Can you walk?" he murmured. "Or shall I carry you?"

Olivia shook her head frantically. She'd endured Margaret's cruelty silently for years to avoid causing strife between mother and son. If Liam carried her now, it would only escalate tensions.

Yet he swept her into his arms anyway, striding past gawking servants into the main parlor. Olivia buried her flaming cheeks against his chest. They'd never been this intimate in front of his family before. Margaret's face turned thunderous.

"Enough of this childish display," she hissed. "Sit down and eat like adults."

"But she was ill here last time, and I wasn't home to care for her," Liam countered, recalling a different grievance. He'd been buried in critical negotiations at Blackwood Enterprises for weeks back then, only learning later of Olivia's sickness.

Margaret's expression tightened dangerously. It hadn't been just any illness—it was when Olivia had been pregnant, and Margaret had forced the termination. A secret Liam still didn't know.

Olivia felt the unspoken threat in Margaret's glare as Liam carried her to the dining room, his protective embrace sparking both comfort and terror. The storm between mother and son was far from over.
###Chapter 58

Olivia's fingers trembled slightly as she clutched the delicate porcelain shards. The afternoon sunlight streaming through the study windows made the gold leaf detailing shimmer like liquid honey.

"That wasn't actually an illness back then. I ensured she had the finest medical care available," Margaret remarked, her hawk-like gaze studying Olivia's reaction with unsettling intensity. When Olivia finally nodded, her smile felt brittle enough to crack.

A bitter laugh caught in Olivia's throat. What could she possibly tell Liam now? Margaret had explicitly forbidden her from bearing Liam's children and even suggested divorcing him soon - all supposedly for Henry's sake. Revealing her past pregnancy and subsequent termination was unthinkable.

"Indeed?" Liam's expression remained an unreadable mask as he took his seat without further questions.

The dinner passed in tense silence, though Margaret surprisingly refrained from her usual barbed comments. As dessert plates were cleared, Olivia caught Liam's eye with a series of subtle hand gestures she'd perfected over years of silence. The antique teapot - Henry's favorite piece shattered during his final days - had been weighing on her mind since returning to Newport.

Without hesitation, Liam nodded. "We'll retrieve it shortly."

Relief flooded Olivia's chest. She remembered how Henry's hands had trembled uncontrollably that day, the heartbreak in his eyes as the centuries-old heirloom slipped from his grasp. At the time, restoration seemed impossible, but now...

Henry's study remained untouched in the guest house behind the main estate. Liam waited at the threshold while Olivia entered alone. She found the teapot fragments exactly where she remembered - carefully preserved in velvet-lined mahogany.

Clutching the box, Olivia lingered among the leather-bound books and polished oak. The scent of pipe tobacco still clung faintly to the drapes. Memories assaulted her - Henry teaching her to distinguish Ming from Qing dynasty porcelain, his deep chuckle when she'd hidden beneath this very desk during important meetings.

This room held her last real conversation with Henry before marrying Liam. "I'm not asking Liam to care for you," he'd said, polishing his spectacles with that familiar deliberate motion. "I'm asking you to care for him. That boy's built walls thicker than Fort Knox, but you..." His eyes had twinkled then. "You've always had the key."

Olivia had promised fervently. But reality proved crueler than childhood dreams. Liam's rare moments of openness hadn't been trust - just practicality. What secrets could a mute girl reveal? And after their marriage, the combined coldness from Liam and Margaret eroded her confidence completely.

Perhaps she owed Henry one more attempt before considering divorce. The thought surprised even herself. Wiping sudden tears, Olivia exited to find Catherine blocking her path with a saccharine smile.

"Henry's things?" Catherine's gaze flickered over the box dismissively. "Stay tonight, Olivia! We'll go shopping tomorrow - just us girls!" Her sudden warmth set alarm bells ringing. Olivia instinctively turned toward Liam, then caught herself - since when did she expect his intervention?

"She's returning with me." Liam's flat refusal made both women startle. Catherine recovered quickly, squeezing Olivia's arm. "Tomorrow then! I'll collect you at ten!" Trapped, Olivia could only nod.

In the car, Liam turned abruptly. "You're mute, Olivia, not paralyzed." His fingers tapped an impatient rhythm on the steering wheel. "When my mother orders you to kneel, why not walk out? Call the police? Scream? What's stopping you - is she holding a gun to your head?"

Olivia gaped at him. Was Liam Blackwood actually encouraging rebellion against Margaret Winslow?

"If it happens again, you call me immediately. Understood?" His intensity made her nod vigorously, tears pricking her eyes. This version of Liam felt like a stranger.

"Has she done this before?" The questions came rapid-fire now. "How often? What exactly did she make you do?"

The car accelerated toward the iron gates, leaving Winslow Manor behind them. Olivia pressed trembling fingers to the window glass, watching her reflection blur with the passing streetlights. For the first time in years, something fragile and hopeful stirred in her chest.
###Chapter 59

Olivia's fingers trembled slightly as Liam's piercing gaze demanded answers. The memory flashed before her eyes - kneeling on the cold marble floor of the Blackwood mansion, scrubbing until her knuckles bled, when Margaret "accidentally" crushed her fingers under her designer heel. That was merely one drop in an ocean of humiliations.

She used to believe compliance would earn Margaret's approval. The painful truth revealed itself soon enough - her meekness only made her a more convenient target.

Rumors whispered how Catherine, when she first married into the family, commanded respect through sheer force of personality. Even Margaret tread carefully around her. Unlike Catherine who avoided confrontation, Olivia's quiet nature painted a bullseye on her back.

But what could Liam truly accomplish if she confessed? Would he challenge his own mother for her sake? The bitter reality settled in her chest - no blood bond would shatter over someone like her.

After a weighted silence, Olivia forced a dismissive wave, mouthing 'It's nothing' with practiced ease.

Liam's eyes narrowed but he let the matter drop.

The next morning found Liam inspecting a construction site, having instructed Olivia not to bother with lunch. Alone in the penthouse, she awaited Catherine's promised visit.

The doorbell chimed at precisely ten. To Olivia's dismay, Margaret swept in alongside Catherine, her Chanel sunglasses perched arrogantly on her nose. "Olivia darling," Margaret drawled, "we're updating your wardrobe today. Can't have you embarrassing the Blackwoods, can we?"

"Margaret, Olivia knows her place remarkably well," Catherine added with a venomous smile. "She'd never dream of refusing you."

Their tag-team bullying was nothing new. Olivia grabbed her purse and followed silently. The luxury mall's gleaming floors reflected her growing pile of shopping bags - a human pack mule for their retail therapy.

Her knees, still tender from yesterday's punishment, screamed with each step. Then Liam's words echoed: You're mute, not powerless.

When Margaret dumped another armload of bags at her feet outside Prada, something snapped.

The bags hit the marble with a satisfying thud. Olivia met Margaret's shocked gaze with steady defiance.

"How dare you!" Margaret's manicured finger jabbed the air. "Pick those up this instant!"

Olivia turned on her heel and strode toward the exit. Theodore would fetch her. No more torture.

"Stop right there!" Margaret's stilettos clicked furiously behind her. Just as bony fingers grazed Olivia's arm, a whirlwind in pink tulle collided with Margaret, sending frozen matcha latte cascading down her Valentino dress.

"Ah! You imbecile!" Margaret shrieked, now dripping green.

"Watch where you're going, hag!" The pink-clad woman fired back before Margaret could speak.

Catherine rushed to Margaret's defense. "That dress costs more than your car! Apologize now!"

Olivia paused, mesmerized by the unfolding drama. The pink tornado wasn't backing down.

"Those cataracts must be advanced if you can't see where you're walking!" The woman sneered. "Or are you just some lonely crone whose kids abandoned you? And you-" she turned to Catherine, "that resting witch face explains why you're still childless at forty!"

Margaret and Catherine turned puce with rage.

"Penelope?" A new voice cut through the tension. Evelyn Hartley stood frozen, clutching a Birkin. "What are you doing here?"

Penelope Adler's bravado evaporated. "E-Evelyn-"

"Running from creditors again?" Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. "While your boutique collapses under debt?"

"Please, not here-" Penelope whimpered.

Evelyn turned to the seething Margaret. "My apologies for her behavior. Shall I make her beg on her knees?"
###Chapter 60

"Oh my God! She just poured juice all over my new dress!" Margaret Winslow shrieked, her face twisting in outrage.

"I'm so terribly sorry! Please let me make this right. I'll pay for the dry cleaning—whatever you need!" Penelope Adler stammered, bowing repeatedly with her hands clasped together in supplication.

Margaret continued berating Penelope for several more minutes before finally dismissing her with a dismissive wave.

Olivia Sinclair observed the scene from across the boutique, her sharp eyes noting the suspicious timing. Evelyn Hartley appeared almost magically, conveniently acquainted with the clumsy woman who'd "accidentally" bumped into Margaret. In a mall this size, the odds of such a perfect collision seemed astronomically low. The whole scenario reeked of careful staging.

"Mrs. Winslow, what a pleasure to see you again. I'm Evelyn Hartley—perhaps you remember me?" Evelyn approached with calculated grace, her voice dripping with honeyed respect.

"Ah yes... I recall you from when you were younger—" Margaret hesitated, studying Evelyn's carefully constructed expression.

Everyone in their social circles knew Evelyn's reputation as Liam Blackwood's shameless mistress. As Liam's mother, Margaret was painfully aware of the rumors.

Margaret had always despised the idea of her son being with someone like Evelyn. She'd much prefer Liam leave his current wife Olivia for a woman of proper breeding and status. Yet today, face-to-face, Evelyn was making an unexpectedly favorable impression.

"You remember me? That's absolutely wonderful! Since fate has brought us together, why don't we have lunch? My treat!" Evelyn practically vibrated with excitement upon realizing Margaret recognized her. She linked arms with the older woman possessively.

"Why don't you join us for dinner at the estate instead? You've been so helpful dealing with that dreadful woman," Margaret suggested, shooting Olivia a venomous glare across the store.

Despite Evelyn's tainted reputation and inferior family background, Margaret found her infinitely preferable to Olivia.

"Dinner at Blackwood Manor? I'd be honored!" Evelyn's voice trilled with girlish delight.

"First let's get you out of those stained clothes. Come, darling, I'll help you change," Evelyn purred, smoothly edging Catherine Winslow aside as she guided Margaret toward the dressing rooms.

With no reason to remain, Olivia texted Theodore to pick her up. By the time her driver arrived, Margaret's entourage had already departed.

When Olivia finally returned home, she found Margaret, Catherine, and Evelyn already ensconced in the grand parlor—with Liam having returned early as well.

Evelyn clung to Margaret's arm, their laughter ringing through the opulent room. Liam, usually so stern, lounged in his favorite armchair looking uncharacteristically at ease.

The scene twisted something in Olivia's chest. They looked like a perfect family unit. She should have realized sooner—Liam's obvious affection for Evelyn, Margaret's blatant preference. Soon Evelyn would give Liam the heir he deserved, completing their happy picture.

"Dinner is served," announced Winston, the butler. Margaret rose with Evelyn still attached to her arm, completely ignoring both Catherine and Olivia.

As Olivia moved toward the staircase, Liam suddenly blocked her path. "Aren't you joining us for dinner?" His deep voice held an unfamiliar note of concern.

Olivia hesitated. At his words, both Evelyn and Margaret turned to stare, their conversation abruptly halted.

"Olivia darling, do come eat with us," Evelyn called sweetly, sounding for all the world like the lady of the house.

"Why bother? She's a grown woman—if she's hungry, she'll feed herself," Margaret sniffed, her disdain palpable.

Feeling more like an unwanted guest than the mistress of Blackwood Manor, Olivia shook her head at Liam, indicating she had no appetite. She needed time alone to think.

As Olivia ascended the grand staircase, she heard no footsteps following. Reaching her bedroom, she closed the heavy oak door, muffling Margaret's booming laughter. Slumping against the door, silent tears finally escaped.

Henry Winslow had urged Olivia to make her marriage work before his passing, but surely even he couldn't have foreseen this. What would he advise now? To keep suffering in silence? Or to finally let go?

Drawing a shuddering breath, Olivia made her decision. Henry had always taught her never to tolerate unhappiness or cling to what wasn't meant to be hers.

After five years of marriage without earning Liam's affection, Olivia refused to remain a burden any longer. She couldn't continue living this half-life of quiet desperation.

Pulling out her phone, Olivia typed a message to Alexander Hayes: "I'm ready to start as Whitmore Holdings' consultant immediately. But I need to ask you a rather large favor..."

Alexander replied almost instantly: "Fantastic news! Grandfather will be thrilled. Name it—anything you need."

"Would it be possible to receive a two-year salary advance? Twenty million. I find myself in urgent need of liquidity..." Olivia's fingers hovered over the screen as she struggled to explain her situation. In her hesitation, she accidentally sent the incomplete message.

While Natalie Bennett had offered to loan her ten million, Olivia knew that would require pulling resources from multiple places. The Hayes family had far deeper pockets, and if Alexander agreed, she preferred handling this discreetly.

But twenty million was no small sum. William Hayes had already been generous offering a one-year advance. Olivia feared she might be overstepping. Aware of the risk—that she might not fulfill her contract and be unable to repay—she quickly added: "I'll sign any contract you require. You have my word."

Before she could send the second message, Alexander's reply appeared: "Consider it done. Just send me your account details—I'll have the transfer processed immediately."
###Chapter 61

Olivia blinked away sleep as she stared at Alexander's message glowing on her phone screen. The words were real. Hot tears pricked at her eyelids. The Hayes family's generosity overwhelmed her.

She remembered William's earlier confession - how Henry had entrusted him with her care, a duty he'd failed to fulfill. The unanswered questions burned in her chest, demanding resolution.

With trembling fingers, Olivia deleted her drafted response and typed anew. "I can't thank you enough. I'd be completely lost without this opportunity."

Alexander's voice note came through, warm with amusement. "Don't mention it. Consider it an advance on your salary. You're worth every penny. No strings attached."

Gratitude had always been Olivia's default setting. She texted back, "What exactly will my responsibilities entail? I'd like to prepare properly."

"Check your inbox," came the immediate reply, followed by a flood of documents.

Olivia buried herself in the files, sprawled across her bed, completely losing track of time. The sudden creak of her bedroom door shattered her concentration.

Liam sauntered in, his usual brooding demeanor replaced by rare lightness. The change stabbed at Olivia's heart. Evelyn's visit had clearly lifted his spirits - a stark contrast to his usual indifference toward her.

"Not hungry?" Liam asked casually as he retrieved a robe from the walk-in closet.

Olivia shook her head silently. Food was the last thing on her mind.

"You should eat anyway," he suggested, his tone bordering on concern.

She ignored him, returning to her documents. Without warning, Liam snatched her phone and tossed it onto the nightstand.

Still wearing his unbuttoned dress shirt, he leaned down, pressing a rough kiss to her cheek. Something inside Olivia snapped. For the first time in five years, she shoved him away with all her strength.

Liam stumbled back, shock flashing across his features. Seizing the moment, Olivia scrambled off the bed and backed toward the door, her wary gaze locked on him. The cognitive dissonance was staggering - downstairs, Liam had shared an intimate dinner with Evelyn, while upstairs he sought intimacy with her.

Disgust twisted Olivia's features. Liam's expression darkened instantly, all traces of good humor vanishing. Instead of pursuing her, he grabbed his robe and stalked into the ensuite bathroom.

Olivia exhaled shakily. She gathered her devices and slipped out, retreating to the adjacent guest room. The mansion had no designated workspace for her, and she certainly couldn't use Liam's study again - not after being accused of stealing documents.

At the vanity table, Olivia booted up her laptop and began outlining ideas. It had been years since she'd engaged in proper financial work. Since marrying Liam, her days had revolved around domestic drudgery. Yet at university, she'd not only won prestigious competitions but had hands-on experience with multimillion-dollar projects.

Soon, she fell into the familiar rhythm. Hours slipped by unnoticed until fatigue dragged at her eyelids. She leaned back on the chaise lounge to organize her thoughts, but sleep claimed her.

Morning light revealed Liam standing in the doorway. Thankfully, her laptop screen had timed out. His glacial stare pinned her in place. "Avoiding me? Is this some new game?"

Rubbing sleep from her eyes, Olivia stood, still wrapped in exhaustion. Perhaps it was the lingering drowsiness that emboldened her. She gestured pointedly toward the master suite, questioning where Evelyn had spent the night.

"You've grown bold," Liam snarled, irritation lacing every syllable. He advanced, pressing an ice-cold thumb against her pulse point. Olivia's breath hitched. His imposing presence should have cowed her, but something had shifted.

Lifting her chin, Olivia met his gaze with uncharacteristic steel - a defiance she hadn't shown in five years of marriage. She refused to sacrifice her dignity any longer. Their silent battle lasted several heartbeats before Liam unexpectedly retreated.

"Bring my lunch at noon," he commanded before striding away.

This time, Olivia had no intention of complying.

After freshening up, she texted Alexander: "Would it be possible to work a half-day today?"

His understanding reply came instantly. Dressed professionally, Olivia descended the stairs with her laptop bag. The butler, Theodore, blinked in surprise at her departure. "Madam, will you be returning? Mr. Blackwood requested his lunch delivery."

Olivia paused, considering. With deliberate indifference, she gestured for the kitchen staff to handle the meal delivery to Blackwood Enterprises. She specified it should be left at reception - she'd take it upstairs herself if necessary.

Theodore watched her go, astonished. The old Olivia would have insisted on preparing everything personally. This new version barely seemed to care. The change was undeniable.

The transformation had begun.
###Chapter 62

Olivia arrived at Whitmore Holdings precisely at nine o'clock. Alexander stood waiting by the marble pillars, his tailored suit accentuating his broad shoulders.

"This is Olivia Sinclair, our new antiquities consultant," Alexander announced to the security team while handing her a platinum access card. His voice carried the weight of undisputed authority.

The sight of the company's COO personally escorting a junior consultant sent whispers rippling through the lobby. Such preferential treatment was unheard of for someone at Olivia's level.

Olivia typed rapidly on her phone screen: "Mr. Hayes, you're too kind. Just direct me to my workspace."

Alexander's lips curved slightly. "Consider it professional curiosity. I'm eager to see our new department take shape." He guided her to the elevator bank.

The ninth floor spread before them - a blank canvas of polished floors and floor-to-ceiling windows. "This will be the Antiquities Research Division's headquarters," Alexander explained. "Eventually we'll occupy an entire building in our Newport campus."

Olivia's fingers trembled against her phone case. She'd expected a cubicle, not an executive floor. The morning light streaming through the windows painted golden rectangles across the empty space.

"Meet Isabella Rossi," Alexander gestured to a sharp-eyed woman with a sleek bob. "Your personal assistant. She's fluent in ASL."

Isabella greeted Olivia with perfect sign language: "Welcome, Ms. Sinclair."

Olivia's eyes widened. She signed back quickly, explaining she could hear perfectly but couldn't speak due to damaged vocal cords.

"Understood," Isabella replied without missing a beat, her professional mask unbroken.

Olivia settled into her corner office, booting up the sleek workstation. As she queued documents for printing, Isabella appeared at the door.

"Have you eaten breakfast? The executive kitchen makes excellent espresso." The assistant's tone carried subtle challenge.

Olivia hesitated. She rarely drank coffee, but the sleepless night had left her exhausted. She signed that she'd take a latte if it wasn't trouble.

Isabella produced a leather-bound notebook with theatrical flourish. "Milk preference? Sugar quantity? We'll establish your permanent profile."

Olivia blinked at the formality. She gestured that she'd visit the kitchen herself later.

"Is there anything else you require?" Isabella's voice held an odd tension.

Seizing the moment, Olivia asked if Isabella had transferred from another department.

"Corporate Finance," came the clipped reply.

Olivia turned her laptop screen toward the assistant, displaying her proposal for the department's inaugural project. Isabella's polished demeanor cracked as she scanned the document.

"You authored this?" Her voice dipped in genuine surprise.

At Olivia's nod, color rose in Isabella's cheeks. "I assumed...forgive me. I thought you were another socialite placement." Her hands tightened around the notebook. "They assigned me as your babysitter."

Understanding dawned. Olivia signed firmly that she intended to prove her worth through results, not connections.

The morning passed in productive frenzy - staffing plans, budget projections, acquisition targets. By noon, Olivia's driver navigated toward Blackwood Enterprises.

The buildings stood barely ten blocks apart. A household staff member waited curbside with an insulated lunch bag bearing the Winslow crest.

The new receptionist - clearly briefed after her predecessor's dismissal - ushered Olivia directly to the penthouse elevator.

Liam sat alone in his cavernous office, sunlight glinting off his gold pen. Olivia set the meal containers on the conference table with quiet efficiency.

"Not your cooking," Liam observed, lifting a lid with visible distaste.

Olivia confirmed the house chefs had prepared it.

Liam's gaze swept over her tailored blazer and pencil skirt. "You didn't come from home." It wasn't a question.

Olivia met his stormy eyes. She typed: "I started at Whitmore Holdings today."

The air thickened. Liam's knuckles whitened around his pen. "We had an agreement."

Olivia remained still as a statue. She pulled up her banking app, showing the $20 million balance. Her fingers moved deliberately across the screen: "I'm ready to transfer the money. Can we finalize the divorce now?"

Liam's chair screeched as he stood. "Twenty million in three days?" His laugh held no humor. "No wonder you took Hayes' offer. Is this your exit strategy? Does Alexander know you're using his money to leave me?"

He rounded the desk, crowding her space. "Tell me truthfully - are you sleeping with him?"

Olivia shook her head violently. She wished she could scream that she wasn't like him - that she honored her vows even in this sham marriage.

The silence between them grew teeth.
###Chapter 63

Olivia clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms. She knew pushing Liam further would only make things worse. With measured movements, she repeated her earlier question in sign language. "Don't you want to marry Evelyn? Why reject my attempts to step aside? Doesn't she want this wedding?"

The silence stretched between them like a taut wire. Liam's expression remained unreadable, the earlier storm in his eyes having dissipated.

After what felt like an eternity, Liam finally spoke. "Leave. We'll discuss the divorce later."

Olivia hadn't expected immediate agreement. She simply nodded, gesturing toward the cooling meal before turning away. The door clicked shut behind her with finality.

That night, the Blackwood mansion remained empty of its master.

Olivia's mind conjured images of Liam at Evelyn's penthouse. Were they planning their wedding date? Or was something more complicated unfolding?

Her feet carried her to the antique vanity. With trembling fingers, she opened the hidden compartment, revealing the shattered remains of Henry's teapot.

The porcelain fragments blurred as tears welled up. Memories of Henry's laughter, her carefree childhood, and abandoned dreams crashed over her. Why hadn't she repaired this while Henry still breathed? Maybe it could have brought him some comfort in those final days.

Her phone buzzed against the mahogany surface. Marcus's text glowed on the screen: "Checking in. Everything alright at home? No pressure about returning to the studio."

A ghost of a smile touched Olivia's lips. She missed Thornton Antiquities desperately - the scent of wood polish, the weight of tools in her hands, the satisfaction of restoring history.

Her reply was brief: "Sorting things here. Will visit soon."

Marcus responded instantly: "Want your tools? I'm heading out tomorrow - could drop them by."

Olivia's fingers flew across the screen. She needed those tools. Henry's teapot couldn't wait any longer.

After exchanging addresses and gratitude, Marcus promised to call before arriving. Olivia set the phone down, assuming this was simple professional courtesy.

She couldn't have been more wrong.

Morning light revealed the truth. Marcus, scion of the influential Whitmores, always knew society's secrets before they broke. The trending headlines confirmed it: "Blackwood Heir's Shocking Diagnosis - End of an Empire?"

Olivia's stomach dropped. Blackwood Enterprises stock plummeted at opening bell.

The articles were vicious. They claimed Liam suffered the same degenerative brain condition that had claimed previous Blackwood patriarchs within three years. Worse, they emphasized his lack of heirs, implying the family line would end with him.

Marcus had known. His texts took on new meaning.

But Olivia's focus shifted from Marcus's foresight to the leak itself. Who else knew? She'd told no one. Surely Ryan Carter kept professional confidences. Evelyn and Margaret loved Liam - they'd never hurt him like this.

Unless... Had Olivia slipped somehow? She'd mentioned family illness before. Could someone have connected dots that didn't exist?

Blackwood Enterprises moved with characteristic efficiency. Within hours, they announced a press conference where Liam would personally debunk the rumors and pursue legal action.

The online frenzy diminished, some articles disappearing entirely. But the damage lingered.

Margaret Winslow's arrival shattered the uneasy calm. "Olivia!" Her shriek echoed through the foyer. "You vile little snake! Did you leak my son's condition? I know it was you!"

Olivia emerged from her room, back straight.

Where Liam might entertain doubt, Margaret embraced certainty. She lunged, manicured claws outstretched, only to be intercepted by the butler. "Madam, please—"

"Don't 'madam' me! This family's suffered enough because of her!" Margaret's chest heaved. "A thousand deaths wouldn't be enough!"

The butler, loyal to the Blackwood household rather than Margaret, defended gently: "She's cared for Mr. Blackwood diligently. Carried his meals daily. It's no small task."

Margaret collapsed onto a settee, temporarily subdued.

The doorbell's chime sliced through the tension.

Olivia's stomach dropped. Marcus. She moved to intercept, but too late.

The butler admitted Marcus, toolbox in hand. "Missed my text?" He smiled. "Brought your gear."

Margaret sprang up like a jack-in-the-box. "Another man? First Alexander Hayes, now this? Have you no shame, Olivia?"

Her voice rose to a shriek that rattled the chandeliers.
###Chapter 64

"Who the hell is this madman?" Marcus gasped, his eyes widening in shock as he stared at Margaret.

Before Olivia could respond, Marcus's expression shifted to one of regret. "Oh, I apologize. You're the patient, aren't you? I shouldn't have said that."

"Shut your mouth!" Margaret's rage was electric, her body coiled like a spring ready to snap.

Olivia quickly stepped between them, flashing Marcus a silent warning—this was her mother-in-law.

"Ah, I see. That must be... challenging," Marcus murmured sympathetically, which only fanned Margaret's fury higher.

"Get out of my house!" Margaret's voice cracked like a whip through the room.

"At your age, you really should watch your temper. High blood pressure isn't a joke," Marcus said calmly. "I'm just here as Olivia's colleague, dropping off some work files. What's got you so riled up? Paranoid much?"

Margaret wasn't listening. She seized Olivia's wrist, her grip like iron. "Caught you red-handed this time, didn't I? You slipped away before, but I'm calling Liam back now! Let's see how you talk your way out of this!"

Olivia twisted her arm, trying to break free, her stomach sinking.

Margaret could play the perfect society matron in public, but behind closed doors, Olivia bore the brunt of her venom.

She had always been Margaret's emotional punching bag.

"Of course you won't divorce—too busy spending Liam's money while keeping a boy toy on the side!" Margaret spat, glaring at Marcus, whom she assumed was some gold-digging plaything. Little did she know, Marcus came from old money himself.

Given Marcus's notorious gossip-mongering, the rumor mill would soon churn out tales of Liam Blackwood's unhinged mother.

The thought lifted a weight off Olivia's chest. She had already decided to divorce Liam. Now, she felt vindicated.

With a sharp jerk, Olivia wrenched her arm free.

Margaret stumbled back, collapsing onto the sofa with a thud.

"You—you hit me!" Margaret gaped at Olivia in disbelief.

Olivia met her gaze with icy detachment. They both knew the truth. So did Marcus and the butler, who had witnessed everything.

Ignoring Margaret's accusations, Olivia turned to Marcus first, thanking him. She admitted she hadn’t checked her phone, missing his messages. Then, hesitating, she gestured—had he known about Liam’s situation before coming?

Marcus, caught but unashamed, shrugged. "Yes."

Olivia blinked. If he’d known all along, he could’ve warned Liam before things escalated. That would’ve earned him Liam’s favor. Telling her had been unnecessary.

The unspoken implication hung in the air—insider information was priceless in their world.

But Marcus didn’t seem to care. "You misunderstood. I’m not that well-connected. Before this blew up, I couldn’t even confirm if the rumors were true."

Olivia exhaled softly. What was done was done. Marcus wasn’t close enough to her or Liam for this to matter.

Unnoticed, Margaret reached her breaking point. She shoved Olivia from behind with all her strength. "Today, you’re going to pay!"

Ever since news of Liam’s illness spread, Margaret’s temper had spiraled. This incident, piled atop her frustrations, unleashed a storm of rage.

Olivia, unprepared, crashed into a cabinet with a sickening crack.

"Olivia!" Marcus shouted, alarmed, as the butler rushed forward—but too late.

Olivia crumpled to the floor, unconscious.

"Open the door!" Marcus barked at the butler, scooping Olivia into his arms. "I’m taking her to Mercy Hospital!"

"Hospital? She’s faking! A slap will wake her up!" Margaret sneered, but no one listened.

The butler flung the door open and frantically dialed Liam’s number. With the house in chaos, he knew he couldn’t handle Margaret alone. After years serving the Blackwoods, he knew only Liam could rein her in.

But the line rang and rang. No answer.

When Olivia opened her eyes, the sterile white ceiling of the hospital greeted her. Natalie’s worried face swam into view. "Olivia, how are you feeling?"

Olivia blinked, disoriented. How had she gotten here?

Glancing down, she saw the IV in her arm. Beside her stood Natalie, Marcus, and Daniel.

"Marcus saw my message on your phone and called me," Natalie explained. "He told me you’d fainted."

Marcus added, "You were out cold, so I used your fingerprint to unlock your phone. Didn’t snoop—just made the call."

Olivia nodded her thanks. Right now, that was the least of her concerns.

Natalie pressed, "How do you feel now?"

Olivia took stock. Aside from a dull ache from the impact, she was fine. She sat up, gesturing that she was okay and thanking everyone.

"Thank us? Please. I’m just glad you’re alive. Who knows what that woman would’ve done to you!" Natalie muttered darkly.

"Olivia fainted because of her mother-in-law. Honestly, someone should drag that woman in for a psych eval," Marcus drawled.

Just then, the door creaked open. The doctor entered. "Awake, I see?" He glanced at Olivia. "Family here? There’s something important we need to discuss."

A heavy silence fell over the room.

Natalie’s voice tightened. "Is it... something serious?"

"Not life-threatening," the doctor reassured. "Just a physical condition."

"Then—Daniel, Marcus, step outside," Natalie ordered firmly. "This doesn’t concern you."

The two men nodded and left without protest. The doctor laid a medical report in front of Olivia. "You’re three weeks pregnant. Were you aware?"

###Chapter 65

The flimsy paper trembled in Olivia Sinclair's hands as her vision blurred. The world around her seemed to warp, reality slipping through her fingers like sand.

She barely registered the doctor's next words. "Her blood work shows severe anemia and malnutrition. She hasn't fully recovered, and now with the pregnancy draining her nutrients, it caused the fainting spell."

"She was malnourished before," Natalie Bennett murmured, equally stunned. She had just begun processing Olivia's decision to leave Liam, and now this? Her thoughts scattered like leaves in the wind.

The doctor folded her arms. "It's your choice. Her current condition isn't ideal for carrying a child, but termination isn't medically necessary."

This wasn't a Blackwood-affiliated hospital. Marcus Whitmore must have taken Olivia somewhere discreet—somewhere the Winslows had no influence. The staff likely didn’t recognize Liam or his family.

Olivia exhaled slowly. If she could trust Marcus to keep this quiet, she could control the narrative.

The doctor tilted her head. "Well? What are you thinking?"

Olivia blinked, snapping back to the present.

Natalie cleared her throat, cheeks flushing. "She's... confused. She thought she wasn't fertile when they—you know."

The doctor smiled knowingly. "There's no such thing as a completely safe window. Without protection, pregnancy can happen at any time."

Olivia's pulse roared in her ears. She had no regrets about leaving Liam, but this? A child—his child—again? After the last time, when the doctor told her she might never conceive again?

"Olivia?" Natalie pressed gently. "Do you want to tell Liam? Or... we could have the hospital contact him discreetly."

Olivia shook her head violently.

The doctor nodded. "Take your time. If you decide to keep it, I can guide you through the precautions." With that, she left, the door clicking shut behind her.

Silence settled—until the door swung open again.

Daniel Bennett stepped in, brow furrowed. "Marcus had to leave—some emergency." His gaze flicked between them. "What's going on? Can I know?"

Olivia exchanged a glance with Natalie. She trusted her best friend implicitly, and Daniel was family. She nodded.

Natalie exhaled. "Olivia's pregnant."

Daniel's jaw slackened. "Damn."

Another heavy silence. Olivia gestured sharply—keep this secret.

"Of course," Natalie said instantly.

Daniel nodded. "Not a word."

"You're not telling Liam?" Natalie asked carefully.

Olivia's throat tightened. She remembered the first time—how she'd handed Liam the ultrasound, heart swelling with hope.

His reaction had crushed her.

His face had darkened as he stared at the image. "Why now?" he'd muttered, voice thick with frustration—not joy.

After that, he'd sent doctors to monitor her, but his indifference never wavered.

He hadn’t wanted that baby.

And Margaret Winslow? She'd whispered fears about Olivia's "condition" being passed down. Liam never contradicted her.

Then, while he was away, Margaret had cornered Olivia. Pressured her. Made her feel like Liam had approved it.

Afterward, the doctor's words had been a death knell: Your uterine lining is too thin. Conceiving again will be difficult.

Yet here she was. Pregnant. Against all odds.

This child was a miracle. And she would protect it.

Olivia signed fiercely to Natalie and Daniel—No one tells Liam. She'd beg Marcus for the same.

Natalie sighed. "Alright, but..." Being a single mother wouldn’t be easy, especially with the Blackwoods as enemies.

Still, she squeezed Olivia's shoulder. "Don’t worry. I’ll be the best godmother this kid could ask for."

Olivia managed a weak smile.

"Shit!" Daniel suddenly cursed, staring at his phone.

Natalie frowned. "What?"

"Nothing. I—I need to call the doctor about something." He scrambled for an excuse.

But Natalie's phone buzzed too.

Olivia leaned over—and her blood turned to ice.

Blackwood Enterprises Announces Press Conference: CEO Liam Blackwood Appears with Evelyn Hartley!

The screen blurred.

Her stomach dropped.

No.

Not again.
###Chapter 66

Olivia Sinclair stood frozen as Natalie Bennett tried to block her view of the television screen. "Olivia, don't—" But it was too late.

A bitter smile twisted Olivia's lips. She'd already witnessed Liam Blackwood and Evelyn Hartley's intimate display at the gala. These tabloid headlines couldn't shock her anymore.

Yet the media frenzy was undeniable. The breaking news featured a shaky video of Liam, supposedly gravely ill. Blackwood Enterprises moved swiftly, issuing a statement promising clarification. True to their word, Liam appeared at a corporate press conference that afternoon.

The camera captured Liam's imposing figure radiating icy authority. Social media erupted with comments about his obvious good health, debunking the rumors instantly.

To silence all doubters, Liam produced his medical records live on air. Investors sighed in relief as stock prices began climbing during his speech.

But the real bombshell was yet to come.

With calculated timing, Liam unveiled Blackwood Enterprises' latest patent - revolutionary technology that would redefine their industry. The stock soared to unprecedented heights within minutes.

Early sellers groaned in regret while those who'd bought the dip celebrated windfall profits exceeding half a year's earnings.

Evelyn's conspicuous absence became the next talking point. She arrived as the conference ended, lingering at the door before joining Liam. Paparazzi captured their exit, spinning tales of romantic tension.

Watching the footage, Olivia exhaled in relief. Her careless comment about family illness could have caused Liam professional harm. But as Marcus Whitmore once told her, in business, even scandals could be leveraged for gain.

"Olivia?" Natalie pocketed her phone, studying her friend with concern. "Are you—"

Olivia shook her head firmly. Using sign language, she explained how nearly dying in the fire had changed her perspective. She would no longer define herself through Liam's eyes. Now, carrying new life within her, she found fresh resolve to stand strong.

"Brilliant decision! I'm with you completely!" Natalie squeezed her hand. "Let me call Mercy Hospital for prenatal care recommendations."

After Natalie left, Olivia texted Marcus. She needed assurance her condition would remain confidential, suspecting his family's hospital connections might already know.

Marcus replied instantly: "Patient confidentiality is sacrosanct here. The staff would protect your privacy regardless." His response carried the weight of Whitmore family honor.

Relieved, Olivia thanked him.

"Don't mention it," Marcus responded. "Actually, Westfield University is launching an antiquities program. They need an expert for promotional videos. You'd be perfect."

Olivia blinked at her phone. "Me?"

Marcus's voice message crackled through: "Absolutely. They want someone with both expertise and screen presence. Who better than the woman who restored the Montgomery collection?"

A spark of excitement flared in Olivia's chest. This was far from her childhood acting dreams, yet the opportunity thrilled her.

Then came the instinctive hesitation—what would Liam think?

Olivia caught herself, disgusted. She'd promised to stop living by Liam's approval. Squaring her shoulders, she typed: "I'll do it."

Marcus sent the schedule immediately. "Shoot's this afternoon. Available?"

The suddenness startled her, but her restoration schedule was flexible. Only Liam's lunch delivery posed a conflict—a habit she needed to break anyway.

As she confirmed, Marcus arranged her flight to Westfield.

Following doctor's orders, Olivia returned home to pack. She needed to deliver something important before leaving.

The sight of Margaret Winslow in her foyer made Olivia freeze.

Margaret's triumphant smirk faltered upon seeing her. "Oh? Crawling back now that the cameras are off?" She advanced like a predator. "No scheme of yours will ever trap my son! Liam turns every situation to his advantage. When the time comes—"

Olivia walked straight past her, ascending the stairs without acknowledgment.

"You insolent—! I'm speaking to you!" Margaret's shriek echoed through the hall. Never had Olivia dared such defiance. The older woman charged after her, only to meet a slammed bedroom door.

"Olivia Sinclair! Have you lost your mind?" Margaret's shrill voice carried through the wood.

Inside, Olivia pressed a hand to her racing heart. This small act of rebellion felt terrifying—and exhilarating. The old Olivia would never have dared. The new Olivia? She was just getting started.
###Chapter 67

Olivia signed both copies of the divorce agreement with steady hands. She sealed them in a sleek document folder and arranged for same-day delivery to Liam's office.

Her personal belongings barely filled a small carry-on. Despite her privileged life at the Blackwood estate, Olivia refused to take anything Liam had given her. Not a single designer dress or piece of jewelry.

Only her essentials and a few childhood treasures made the cut - a faded photograph, her mother's pearl earrings, and a worn copy of her favorite novel. Everything fit neatly into one bag.

Descending the grand staircase, Olivia heard Margaret's shrill voice before seeing her. "Finally decided to show yourself?" Margaret snapped, having already ordered the butler to confiscate Olivia's room keys.

The older woman rushed forward, blocking Olivia's path. "What? The little mute can't even acknowledge me now? Have you completely lost your senses?"

This time, Olivia met Margaret's glare head-on - a stark contrast to her usual submissive demeanor.

Dressed in a tailored black pantsuit with heels that added inches to her frame, Olivia now stood taller than her mother-in-law. Light makeup accentuated her striking features, giving her an air of quiet authority that made Margaret falter.

Margaret's mouth gaped. Was this really the same girl who'd silently endured her abuse for years? The one who'd scrubbed floors on her knees without complaint?

Without breaking eye contact, Olivia raised her hand. With an elegant flick of her wrist, she made a dismissive gesture that needed no translation.

"How dare—" Margaret sputtered, clutching her chest as Olivia strode past. Regaining her voice, she scurried after her. "You ungrateful little—"

Olivia stopped abruptly at the front door. Margaret nearly collided with her back, halting mid-tirade.

Pulling out her phone, Olivia typed rapidly. The mechanical voice announced: "Take up the divorce with your son. If he agrees, I'll leave the Blackwood name behind today."

Margaret's face purpled with rage but she had no retort.

Outside, Olivia handed the documents to the waiting courier. A sleek black Mercedes idled at the curb. Isabella waved from the driver's seat - she'd insisted on accompanying Olivia to the airport.

Whitmore Holdings had expedited all arrangements for Olivia's business trip to Newport after learning of her participation in their new campaign.

"We've got VIP clearance," Isabella said as they pulled away. "We'll bypass security and go straight to the gate. Our flight boards in forty minutes."

Watching the Blackwood mansion shrink in the rearview mirror, Olivia exhaled deeply. For the first time in years, she felt light. Free.

After the streamlined security process, Olivia settled into her first-class seat. She tapped Isabella's arm, gesturing to her phone.

Though the divorce papers had been delivered to Blackwood Enterprises, Olivia knew they might sit at reception unless Liam was notified. The front desk wouldn't automatically forward personal correspondence.

Isabella's eyes sparkled with understanding. "Say no more," she grinned, already dialing.

Olivia's tumultuous marriage was hardly secret. In elite circles, everyone knew about Liam Blackwood's "hidden wife" - the childhood sweetheart he'd wed then ignored, while his very public affair with Evelyn Hartley played out in tabloids.

Sebastian answered on the second ring. "Mr. Blackwood's office."

"This is Isabella Rossi, Olivia Sinclair's assistant," she announced crisply. "The divorce documents have arrived at your headquarters. See that Mr. Blackwood signs them immediately." She hung up before Sebastian could respond.

At Blackwood Enterprises, Sebastian froze outside the conference room. As one of the few who knew Olivia's true status, he'd never expected this call.

He dispatched an intern to retrieve the envelope. The thick packet felt heavy in his hands. How to present this bombshell during a board meeting?

Inside, the mood was celebratory. Blackwood Enterprises had just weathered a damaging PR storm, and executives were dissecting the source of the leak.

"Mr. Blackwood," ventured one VP, "aside from family, who knew about your medical appointments?"

"We wouldn't have known you'd collapsed if not for the news reports!"

"Only Sebastian knew. He arranged the airlift to Mercy Hospital."

The unspoken accusation hung in the air. Eyes darted toward Sebastian, who stood paralyzed by the door.

"She wouldn't do that." Liam's voice cut through the murmurs like ice.

At that moment, Sebastian approached. "Sir," he whispered, "your wife sent this."

Liam's brow furrowed as he opened the folder. Seeing "Divorce Agreement" in bold letters, he let out a humorless laugh. "Where is she?"

His call went straight to voicemail. Olivia's phone was off.

Sebastian checked the tracking. "She's airborne, sir. Flight 227 to Newport. Just took off twelve minutes ago."

Liam's face darkened. "Contact air traffic control. Turn that plane around."
###Chapter 68

The command left Liam's lips like a whip crack. Sebastian Montgomery sprang into action immediately. With Blackwood Enterprises' vast influence in the city, grounding a flight or removing a passenger should have been child's play.

But fate had other plans. Olivia's plane had already taken off.

Forcing an airborne aircraft to turn back required serious justification - mechanical failure or medical emergency - none of which applied here. Liam's expression darkened like a gathering storm, fury simmering in his piercing gaze. Olivia had always kept him informed of her movements, yet this time she'd slipped away to Halstead without warning, serving him divorce papers at the last possible moment.

"Contact our Halstead team," Liam ordered through clenched teeth. "Have them stationed at arrivals. The moment Olivia steps off that plane, detain her. I want her brought back to me immediately!"

Meanwhile, thirty thousand feet in the air, Olivia managed to catch some restless sleep. She only stirred when Isabella Rossi gently shook her shoulder as they began their descent.

Straightening her blouse, Olivia reviewed her packed schedule. A screen test awaited them immediately after landing, followed by intensive preparations for the upcoming shoot.

"Thank heavens Mr. Whitmore booked us first class," Isabella remarked, stretching her arms. "We'll be able to clear customs quickly."

No sooner had they stepped into the arrivals hall than a dozen imposing men materialized around them, dressed as ordinary travelers but moving with military precision. Their leader held up a photo for verification before addressing Olivia with polite firmness.

"Mrs. Blackwood," he said, "Mr. Blackwood insists on your immediate return. Please don't make this difficult."

Olivia's stomach dropped. She'd anticipated Liam's resistance, but not this swift response. Despite his apparent interest in ending their marriage for Evelyn Hartley, he seemed determined to drag her through the wreckage of their five-year union.

She shook her head defiantly, signing with sharp, emphatic gestures that she wouldn't be going anywhere. Her chin lifted in silent challenge as curious travelers began to slow their steps, sensing drama.

The leader's expression hardened. "I don't know what's between you and Mr. Blackwood, but we have our orders—"

Isabella cut in, her voice rising with theatrical outrage. "We have professional commitments! And what you're doing borders on kidnapping! Think carefully before crossing that line!"

When the men hesitated, Isabella played her trump card. She threw her arms wide and shrieked, "Help! They're trying to traffic us!"

"Quiet!" the leader hissed, panic flashing across his face as airport security turned their way. "Miss, if you don't want to come, fine, but this hysterics will land us all in handcuffs!"

Isabella bared her teeth in a feral grin. "Get lost!"

In the ensuing confusion, they bolted for the exit where their prearranged transport waited. The car sped toward Halstead University's renowned film studio, a favorite location for the cinema department's projects.

"This is Olivia Sinclair," Isabella announced as they entered the soundstage. "She communicates through sign language due to a vocal condition. I'll be interpreting for her."

The director, a recent Halstead graduate, shook Olivia's hand warmly. "Understood. We're shooting an alumni promotional piece today."

Olivia offered a professional smile, her attention already shifting to the task at hand.

Isabella translated Olivia's quick signs. "What's the shooting plan? What do you need from her?"

To everyone's surprise, Olivia displayed remarkable comfort before the cameras, her nerves nowhere in sight.

"We'll need various angles - close-ups of the restoration work, wider shots showing technique," the director explained. "When you're on camera, amplify your movements slightly for clarity."

A woman with cascading curls stepped forward unexpectedly. "Let me demonstrate proper framing," she offered with a saccharine smile. "I'm studying method acting."

Olivia nodded politely, though her sharp eyes caught the whispered exchange between the actress and director: "If my takes are stronger, can I replace her? Wouldn't that make more sense?"

"What's this about?" Isabella demanded, stepping between them like a protective lioness. "Olivia is the featured talent for this project."

The actress batted her lashes. "But as a current student, wouldn't I better represent the university's standards?"

The air between the women crackled with unspoken challenge as the crew held their collective breath.
###Chapter 69

Olivia's blood boiled at the woman's veiled insult, but Isabella discreetly pulled at her sleeve, silently urging restraint. With practiced fingers, Olivia signed, "Plans may falter, but effort never betrays."

These very words had been Henry's gift to her years ago.

Taking a steadying breath, Olivia retreated, clearing the stage for the audition.

"Action!" The director's monotone call lacked conviction as cameras rolled. Their rival struck a practiced pose, her angles calculated for maximum flattery. Every movement screamed professional training, her symmetrical features glowing under studio lights.

When the director called cut, the woman turned with theatrical confidence. "Well? How was that?"

"Passable," the director muttered, rubbing his temple in clear dissatisfaction.

Smirking victoriously, the woman dismissed Olivia with a wave. "I suppose we're done here? Do thank Olivia for wasting everyone's time."

Isabella's hands clenched into fists, but Olivia calmly signed her response.

Bypassing the woman entirely, Isabella addressed the director after interpreting Olivia's signs. "The methodology demonstrated fundamentally misrepresents artifact preservation."

The director leaned forward. "Elaborate."

"Excessive pressure from the tweezers risks permanent damage," Olivia observed through Isabella's voice. "The inspection angle violated basic protocols. And the magnifying glass?" A pointed pause. "It was inverted. No trained professional would make such elementary errors."

With each critique, the woman's smugness crumbled like ancient parchment.

"Let me retake!" she begged the director.

But his patience had evaporated. "This isn't some modeling gig," he snapped. "We're showcasing academic rigor, not your Instagram portfolio. Your technique undermines our department's credibility."

His glare could have etched glass. "Why are you still here?"

The woman fled without another word.

"My apologies," the director sighed, turning to Olivia. "Trustee's daughter. Political favors."

Isabella frowned. "Won't she complain to her father?"

The director smirked. "My father chairs the board. She wouldn't dare."

Adjusting his glasses, he guided Olivia into position. "No theatrics needed. Just show us the precision that earned you the Whitmore Fellowship."

Olivia nodded, fingers already moving with practiced grace.

The session flowed seamlessly afterward, concluding with plans for tomorrow's final shoot.

At their luxurious hotel suite courtesy of Marcus Whitmore, Isabella twirled in delight. "This beats Whitmore Holdings' budget accommodations by miles!"

After ensuring Olivia needed nothing, Isabella grinned. "Room service is ordered. I'm off to soak in that jacuzzi until I prune!"

Alone, Olivia changed into silk pajamas when sharp knocks interrupted her solitude.

Expecting dinner, she opened the door—only to be shoved against the wall by a hurricane of expensive cologne and fury.

Liam Blackwood loomed over her, his breathing ragged as if he'd sprinted across the city. "Since when do you ignore my calls?" he demanded, fingers digging into her chin.

But the trembling doe eyes he expected to find had hardened into glacial steel.

Her single signed "Yes" struck like a slap—affirmation of her newfound defiance.

Liam barked a disbelieving laugh before lunging for a kiss.

Olivia's knee met his abdomen with surgical precision. As he doubled over, she wrenched free and flung the door open—a silent ejection notice.

"I'm your husband—" Liam rasped, then straightened with fresh determination. "I'm staying."

Olivia's refusal needed no interpreter.

His smirk turned predatory as he snatched her handbag. "How was the shoot?" he taunted, unzipping it with deliberate slowness.

Olivia froze—then lunged. Inside lay the ultrasound image she couldn't let him discover.
###Chapter 70

"What's wrong with you?" Liam demanded, his expression stunned by Olivia's violent reaction. His fingers tightened around her designer handbag, his other hand clamping down on her wrist like a vice. "Have you completely lost it? My mother said you've been behaving oddly at the estate! Explain yourself!"

Olivia remained silent. When Liam grabbed her, pure instinct took over - she sank her teeth into his hand without hesitation.

The overwhelming need to protect her secret pregnancy consumed her. She couldn't risk Liam discovering the truth, not when she knew exactly how dangerous that knowledge would be.

"Jesus Christ!" Liam jerked back, staring at the bite marks in shock. This wasn't the docile Olivia he knew. Seizing the moment, she yanked her bag free from his grasp.

"You're hiding something," Liam accused, his eyes narrowing. Then realization dawned. "It's true then? You actually cheated on me?"

Olivia quickly checked her bag's contents before meeting Liam's gaze with icy defiance.

"You're taking me back to our childhood," Liam murmured, his voice softening unexpectedly. "Remember our first real fight?"

The memory flashed through Olivia's mind unbidden. As a child, her fiery temper had been legendary. It was that same passionate spirit that had first drawn Natalie to her.

There had been an incident where Liam stole something precious from her, and young Olivia had launched herself at him with the fury of a hurricane.

Liam, several years older, had been raised with the old-fashioned rule about never striking girls. He'd endured her pummeling without retaliation, even as Henry chuckled in the background, amused by Liam's poor decision to provoke someone as fierce as Olivia.

"Haven't seen that side of you in years," Liam commented, an odd smile playing on his lips. "Still as wild as ever."

But Olivia remained unmoved by his nostalgia. The memory only reminded her of old wounds that never properly healed. She recalled overhearing Liam complain about how he disliked strong-willed women, specifically citing her once-fiery personality as unattractive.

In her desperate attempts to win his affection, Olivia had carefully tempered her spirit, molding herself into someone softer, more pliable. And still, it hadn't been enough.

Suddenly, Liam moved with startling speed, snatching the bag from her grasp. With one fluid motion, he upended it onto the bed. His eyes immediately locked onto several folded documents among the scattered items.

Snatching one up, Liam unfolded it quickly, his expression darkening as he read. He whirled toward Olivia, brandishing the paper like a weapon. "You carry divorce papers with you on business trips now?"

It was an exact copy of the documents Olivia had sent him weeks ago.

Olivia stood perfectly still, her face an unreadable mask, but her hand drifted unconsciously to cradle her stomach in a protective gesture that spoke volumes.

"Olivia," Liam said, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper as he stepped closer. "You're already my wife."

He reached out to tuck a stray lock of hair behind her ear, his touch deceptively gentle. "You belong to me. Forever. Do you understand?"

Olivia met his gaze squarely, her eyes blazing with silent challenge that seemed to ask, "Yours? On what terms?"

Before Liam could respond, Olivia's gestures became sharp and emphatic, making it clear she was neither his pet nor his possession - she refused to be controlled at his whim.

Liam's face twisted in confusion and irritation. "What the hell are you saying?"

Olivia didn't retreat. Her hands trembled slightly as she signed rapidly, accusing him of treating Evelyn as his lover while keeping her like some prized show dog, with no regard for her feelings.

This marked the first time Olivia had ever been so brutally honest about their twisted relationship.

"A pet?" Liam scoffed, shaking his head in disbelief. "You begged for this marriage. Now you want out? It doesn't work that way!"

With that final declaration, Liam slammed the door behind him, leaving Olivia alone in the ringing silence.

For what felt like hours, Olivia remained frozen. Eventually, she moved to gather her scattered belongings. Hidden in a secret compartment of her bag was the crumpled pregnancy test - mercifully unnoticed during their confrontation.

Despite Liam's accusations, Olivia knew the truth. She'd never forced him into marriage. He'd chosen this path willingly.

The next morning at precisely nine, Olivia and Isabella arrived at the filming location. While this marked Olivia's first professional shoot, she felt an unexpected calm beneath her nervous excitement.

That calm shattered the moment they entered the studio. There, lounging comfortably in the director's chair as if she owned the place, sat the last person Olivia wanted to see: Evelyn, all smiles as she chatted up the director.

"Who invited the uninvited guest?" Isabella muttered under her breath, her displeasure evident.

"She's just here for a screen test," a familiar male voice remarked casually from behind them.

Olivia's stomach dropped as Liam appeared. She closed her eyes briefly, a bitter smile touching her lips.

Natalie had always told her to do her best and let fate handle the rest. But here was proof that sometimes, no matter how hard you tried, certain people would always interfere.

Even here in Newport, Liam's influence reached like dark tendrils.

The director, despite his prestigious reputation and the authority he'd displayed during yesterday's casting, suddenly seemed diminished in Liam's presence.

"Does she even know the first thing about antique restoration?" Isabella snapped, her frustration boiling over. "If this is going to be some kind of joke, we shouldn't have wasted our time!"

"Now, now, no need for rudeness," Evelyn said, rising gracefully from the director's chair with a practiced smile. "I actually have acting experience, and I'm looking to return to the industry. This project seemed like the perfect opportunity."

The director coughed awkwardly, clearly uncomfortable with Evelyn's transparent excuse.

Everyone present could see through the charade - this university promotional shoot had simply become another stage for Evelyn to upstage Olivia.

And Liam, doing nothing to stop it, appeared to be endorsing the whole farce.

Turning to Olivia with a saccharine smile, Evelyn proposed, "Since restoration isn't my expertise, I'll handle the establishing shots. Olivia, perhaps you could manage the detailed close-ups?"
###Chapter 71

Olivia's suggestion made Isabella gasp sharply, her eyes widening in shock at the boldness of the idea. If she hadn't restrained herself, Isabella might have erupted into a furious outburst right then.

Olivia turned to Liam, her face an unreadable mask. The mere thought of performing hand movements while her actual role was being stolen without consent felt like a slap to her dignity.

In the past, Olivia might have endured such disrespect, believing pleasing Liam was worth the sacrifice. But she'd learned the hard way that silence only invited more exploitation.

Despite her growing awareness, a tiny part of Olivia still hoped Liam would step in, that he'd finally defend her against Evelyn's overreach.

Their eyes met briefly in silent communication. Olivia searched his gaze for any sign of support, but found none.

"Interesting idea," Liam finally said in an indifferent tone. "Olivia, come here."

"How dare you!" Isabella exploded, her fiery glare locked onto Liam.

Olivia responded with a rare, bitter smile that momentarily stunned Liam with its striking beauty.

With one decisive motion, Olivia made her choice - she walked off set.

"She's not doing it!" Isabella immediately voiced Olivia's decision, shooting daggers at Evelyn. "No one said Olivia had to participate. She's here as an assistant, not to be forced into something against her will."

Taking Olivia's arm firmly, Isabella marched them toward the exit.

The studio fell silent. Liam's irritation grew visibly while Evelyn, caught off guard, forced a tight smile. "I'll do it myself then," she told the director.

"Fine," the director replied smoothly, already adjusting his camera settings.

When Evelyn picked up the tweezers, the director stopped her with a raised hand. "Wait, your grip is all wrong. You'll damage the artifacts holding them like that," he said, echoing Olivia's earlier advice.

Evelyn blinked in confusion. "How should I hold them then?"

The director pulled up footage from yesterday, showing Olivia's flawless technique. He paused the video to emphasize her precise movements.

Evelyn's face tightened as she watched Olivia's skilled demonstration, the comparison clearly stinging her pride.

When she attempted to use the magnifying glass next, the director stopped her again. "Your positioning is still incorrect. Do you even know how to use these tools? We didn't cover this yesterday."

Evelyn stared helplessly at the unfamiliar equipment. Flustered, she turned to Liam. "What should I do?"

"I'll find someone," Liam said tersely, pulling out his phone without concern.

"Mr. Blackwood," the director said professionally, "we only have this morning to shoot. Another crew takes over this afternoon, and I have other commitments."

The director sat back, waiting as minutes ticked away with no replacement found.

"Liam..." Evelyn's voice trembled, tears welling in her eyes. "Please call Olivia back to do the hand movements for me. She'll listen to you."

Liam hesitated, remembering Olivia's firm stance about their impending divorce. Would she really obey him now?

He sensed a change in her - she wasn't the compliant Olivia who always yielded to his demands anymore.

Without a word, Liam left the studio.

Olivia and Isabella hadn't gone far, waiting nearby for their ride.

"Olivia," Liam called as he approached.

"What do you want now?" Isabella snapped, stepping protectively in front of Olivia.

"She's my wife," Liam said firmly, meeting Isabella's glare. "I need to speak with Olivia privately."

Isabella clenched her jaw but stepped aside after Olivia's subtle nod, though her anger remained palpable.

"I need you to film the hand movements," Liam demanded, trying to assert his authority.

Olivia stood her ground, shaking her head firmly.

"Just do as I say," Liam said, discomfort flickering across his face at her defiance. "If you cooperate this time—"

Before he could finish, Olivia gestured sharply - asking if he'd agree to the divorce in exchange for her cooperation. Her terms were clear.

Liam recoiled at her audacity to use divorce as leverage. A disbelieving laugh escaped him.

"Divorce? You're negotiating with me now?" His laughter died as he grabbed her wrist, pulling her close in intimidation. "Just because you work for the Whitmores doesn't mean you can dictate terms. How long do you think they'll protect you? If I go after them, do you really believe they'll stand by you?"
###Chapter 72

Olivia's jaw tightened, her lashes fluttering slightly as she confronted the harsh truth of her circumstances. No matter where she went, complications always seemed to chase her. But did that mean she should surrender to Liam's control forever?

Her gaze locked with Liam's, burning with an intensity that made him blink. The fire in her eyes was new - a blazing defiance he'd never witnessed before.

"Liam, we shouldn't pressure her. If Olivia isn't comfortable, I'll withdraw from the shoot. She deserves that choice," Evelyn interjected, her voice dripping with false sympathy.

Olivia gave Evelyn a dismissive glance, signaling she could manage perfectly well without her.

"Isabella says you're free to leave. Olivia will begin filming the moment you're gone," Isabella relayed sharply, irritation coloring her tone.

"Perfect, let's have Olivia take over then. We're all set to begin," the director announced, swiftly organizing the crew. The unspoken consensus in the room clearly favored Evelyn's departure.

Evelyn's eyes darted to Liam, seeking support, but found his attention wholly consumed by Olivia. His intense stare held no room for Evelyn's theatrics.

When the successful shoot concluded, Westfield University sent Olivia a glowing commendation letter. Beaming with pride, she snapped a photo and shared it across her social platforms, savoring this hard-earned victory.

For the first time in years, Olivia tasted genuine happiness - a stark contrast to the suffocating existence under Liam's thumb. She'd spent too long walking on eggshells, catering to Liam's moods and Evelyn's manipulations. Why should she keep considering their feelings when hers were constantly disregarded?

"Did you hear? Miss Clarke is coming for an inspection today!"

Office chatter swirled around Olivia as she worked at Whitmore Holdings. Normally, she ignored such gossip, but one name caught her attention.

"Victoria? She always makes a spectacle of these visits," a colleague scoffed.

Another voice chimed in, "Exactly. All show, no substance. She holds no real authority here."

"Besides, she won't even visit our department. Nothing to worry about."

Despite their reassurance, unease prickled Olivia's skin. Victoria bore a personal grudge against her. With Alexander and William's backing, Olivia hoped Victoria wouldn't dare cause trouble.

She underestimated Victoria's audacity.

A commotion erupted in the hallway, followed by Victoria's shrill voice. "A new department? My expertise in antique restoration qualifies me to inspect it."

Olivia's pulse quickened. Victoria was coming for her. Their last encounter had ended with Victoria's humiliation after destroying an artifact Olivia restored.

Though vindicated, Olivia knew Victoria's resentment hadn't faded. Now that Victoria discovered Olivia's position at Whitmore Holdings, trouble was inevitable.

Clicking heels announced Victoria's arrival. She appeared in the doorway, clad in an eye-searing fuchsia ensemble.

"Olivia! What a...surprise," Victoria lied through her teeth, her gaze sweeping the room. "So this is where you've been hiding. Explains all the commotion I've heard since arriving. Your talent for disruption remains unmatched!"

Olivia rose calmly, meeting Victoria's glare with steady composure. The office had been silent until Victoria's dramatic entrance.

Olivia knew exactly why she'd come - to fabricate issues and stir conflict.

"Even new departments must follow company regulations. These cabinets violate standards. Rearrange them immediately or face consequences," Victoria demanded, pointing to storage units in the corner.

"Those items are heat-sensitive," Isabella countered sharply. "Their placement complies with company policy regarding temperature control."

Isabella, familiar with Victoria's antics, refused to indulge her theatrics.

"Was this arrangement approved? Or are you making arbitrary changes? Look at your manager!" Victoria sneered. "A housewife with no professional experience dictating procedures? The absurdity!"

Olivia had anticipated this. Earlier, she'd prepared a message on her phone. Now, she displayed it calmly: "Does William know about the bookstore fire?"

William had once apologized for Victoria's behavior after she'd humiliated Olivia at a party. Olivia now realized the Hayes family remained unaware of the bookstore arson incident.

Victoria's smug mask cracked. Fear and rage twisted her features. "You dare threaten me?" she hissed.

Then her expression morphed into a vicious grin. "You should know Abigail is marrying my cousin soon. Not only is she my dearest friend, but your mother-in-law's niece. Soon, Margaret will side with me. How long do you think you'll last here?"
###Chapter 73

"Victoria, what are you doing here?" Alexander's voice sliced through the tension as he unexpectedly appeared in Olivia's office.

He carried a thick stack of files, likely there for a business delivery, but his expression darkened the moment he spotted Victoria. "Who authorized your presence here?"

"I-I just wanted to inspect—" Victoria's earlier confidence evaporated under Alexander's piercing gaze, replaced by sudden timidity.

"Inspect what? You hold no position in Whitmore Holdings. There's nothing here for you to inspect." Alexander's contempt dripped from every clipped word.

"How can you say that? I'm a Whitmore too—" Victoria protested weakly.

"Being a Whitmore grants you no privileges here. You own zero shares in this company, and your interference won't be tolerated. I've overlooked it before, but next time, I'll bring Grandfather into this."

Victoria paled at the mention of William Whitmore, recalling how he'd publicly humiliated her at the last gala without a second thought for appearances.

"Alexander, I merely came to see Olivia," Victoria attempted to explain before adding with false sweetness, "Besides, Abigail—Olivia's sister-in-law's niece—is preparing to become your bride—"

Before she could finish, Alexander interrupted sharply. "Who told you Abigail and I are marrying? I've made my refusal clear to Grandfather. Where are you getting these absurd rumors?"

Victoria flushed crimson.

"Leave. Now." Alexander's patience had clearly expired. "Or shall I have security remove you?"

Faced with the prospect of being dragged from her family's company, Victoria muttered, "Fine, I'm going!"

The moment she disappeared, Alexander turned to Olivia with unexpected intensity. "I have no intention of marrying Abigail."

Olivia blinked in surprise, uncertain why he felt compelled to share this with her. Still, she offered a gentle smile and signed, "My marriage was a mistake. If you marry, let it be for love, not obligation."

Realizing Alexander couldn't understand sign language, Olivia quickly typed the message into her phone.

Neither noticed the discreet phone recording their entire exchange from the hallway.

Later that afternoon, as Olivia exited Whitmore Holdings, she spotted a familiar Rolls-Royce idling nearby. Liam's car.

Olivia hesitated, considering retreating back inside, but the car door swung open before she could move.

"You see me and your first instinct is to run?" Liam's voice carried an edge she hadn't heard in weeks.

Reluctantly, Olivia approached.

"Why haven't you returned home?" Liam demanded, his grip tightening around her wrist.

Since returning from Westhaven with Isabella, they'd checked into a hotel near the airport and Olivia had gone straight to work the next morning, avoiding the Blackwood estate entirely. She'd assumed Liam would be too preoccupied comforting Evelyn after her failed sabotage attempt to notice Olivia's absence.

Yet here he stood, personally collecting her from work.

Olivia pulled her hand free with deliberate slowness.

Liam's demeanor shifted instantly, frustration rolling off him in waves. He seemed torn between forcing her into the car and maintaining appearances before Whitmore Holdings employees.

"What game are you playing?" His gaze burned into her.

Olivia signed firmly, reminding him she'd already made her stance on divorce clear.

A spark of anger flashed in Liam's eyes. "You think mentioning divorce means you can abandon our home? I never agreed to that! You're coming with me now!"

Olivia instinctively stepped back.

In the past, such fury from Liam would have sent her scrambling to appease him. Normally, the slightest frown had her rushing to smooth things over.

But today was different. Despite his visible rage, Olivia held her ground, signing firmly that she'd only return if he promised not to lay a hand on her. Otherwise, she'd never set foot in that house again.

Liam's anger simmered, each passing second testing Olivia's resolve.

Defying Liam felt foreign, terrifying. But she couldn't continue like this. For her child's sake, she needed to break free from this toxic cycle.

After an eternity of tension, Liam relented. "Fine. Have it your way. Get in."

With his begrudging assurance, Olivia entered the car. She'd expected a chauffeur, but Liam himself took the wheel.

Buckling up, Olivia stared resolutely ahead, preferring silence to conversation. The last time she'd sat in this car, Evelyn had made a show of sanitizing the seat afterward, as if Olivia carried some contagion.

"Mother's birthday is in three days," Liam announced as the engine purred to life. "Keep the peace until then. We'll discuss everything after."

The mention of Margaret's birthday sent ice through Olivia's veins. Those were memories she'd rather forget. While Liam merely had to make a fashionable entrance at the party, Olivia had been forced to arrive a week early each year—scrubbing silverware, polishing floors, enduring Margaret's cruel whims.

This year would be different.

Unable to sign while Liam drove, Olivia typed a message and let her phone's voice assistant declare: "I won't be assisting with the birthday preparations. Hire staff if needed."

Liam shot her a startled glance. "What's this about? Since when do we need extra staff for Mother's party?"

Olivia met his gaze squarely as her phone continued: "Am I not treated as staff? Cleaning, taking out trash, washing dishes—I do the work no servant would tolerate."

Liam's expression darkened. He abruptly pulled the car onto the shoulder, turning to face her with urgent intensity. "Explain yourself. Now."
###Chapter 74

Olivia studied Liam with detached composure, her hopes already extinguished. She knew his questions arose from idle curiosity rather than genuine care. The man who'd never defended her wouldn't suddenly start confronting Margaret or shielding her from the constant torment.

With economical gestures, she signed her reply. "Every year on your mother's birthday, I become the mansion's unpaid servant for a week. I won't endure this anymore. Do you object?"

"Did she force you? What exactly did they make you do? What happened last year?" Liam pressed, his brow furrowing. "Why keep silent until now?"

Olivia's hands moved with practiced efficiency as she listed her humiliations - washing mountains of dishes after parties, scrubbing marble floors on her knees until they bled. The antique gallery's dust had triggered asthma attacks that left her coughing for weeks.

Liam's expression darkened. "Why didn't you tell me sooner?"

Her signing turned sharp, fingers slashing through the air. "Would you have believed me then? Do you believe me now? When have you ever taken my word over theirs?"

The silence stretched between them, thick with unspoken accusations. Liam had always trusted his own flawed judgment over others' accounts. Even now, part of him wondered if Olivia fabricated these claims to strengthen her divorce case.

Disappointment flashed in Olivia's eyes. She gave him one final piercing look before turning toward the window, withdrawing into herself.

The engine roared to life as Liam pulled back onto the road. "I never knew," he murmured, the words heavy with belated remorse.

Olivia remained motionless, her profile carved from ice. There were countless things Liam didn't know - not because they were hidden, but because he'd never cared to look. His willful blindness regarding Evelyn proved that.

When they reached the estate, Liam killed the engine but made no move to exit. "Go ahead inside," he instructed abruptly.

Olivia didn't hesitate, slipping from the car with palpable relief.

Alone in the driver's seat, Liam exhaled sharply before dialing Margaret's number.

"Darling!" Margaret's musical laughter filled the line. "Have you finished your meeting?"

"I need answers," Liam cut through her pleasantries. "What exactly did Olivia do during last year's birthday preparations?"

A beat of silence. Then Margaret's carefully modulated reply: "She helped with guest arrangements, dear. Mostly lounged about, if I recall."

"That's all?" Liam's grip tightened on the phone. "No household chores? No floor scrubbing?"

"Goodness, no! We have staff for that." Margaret's forced chuckle grated against his ear. "Why would you even ask such things?"

"Because Olivia described spending the week as your personal maid."

"Preposterous!" Margaret's voice climbed an octave. "That ungrateful girl would say anything to turn you against me!"

"I saw you raise your cane at her," Liam countered coldly. "More than once."

The line went quiet before Margaret adopted a defensive tone. "Discipline is necessary when she misbehaves. If she's like a daughter to me, isn't that my right?"

"Mistakes like supposedly seeing Alexander?" Liam's voice turned dangerous.

"Even if nothing happened, she should've known better than to be alone with him!" Margaret's self-righteousness made Liam's stomach churn. In her world, Olivia was always at fault, regardless of facts.

Liam ended the call without another word, immediately dialing a different number. "Adrian," he greeted the family's former butler.

Adrian Mueller had served Henry Winslow for decades, overseeing the estate with military precision. Even in retirement, he remained the family's most trusted confidant.

"I need the truth," Liam said without preamble. "How did my mother really treat Olivia during those birthday weeks?"

A weighted pause. Then Adrian's measured response: "Why ask now? Your grandfather always said truth-seekers must examine their motives. Are you looking to defend your wife or justify your mother?"

The unspoken challenge hung between them - a test of Liam's character that went far beyond this single question.
###Chapter 75

After Adrian posed his question, Liam fell into silence. Would he confront Margaret for an apology if Olivia was telling the truth? And if Olivia was lying, would he demand she apologize to Margaret? The hostility between Margaret and Olivia was common knowledge, and Liam had always been aware of their strained relationship. He'd simply chosen not to interfere, assuming they'd work it out themselves.

"Think it over. When you're ready for the truth, come find me," Adrian said with sincerity.

True to his word, Liam didn't lay a finger on Olivia. That night, he avoided the master bedroom entirely, leaving it for Olivia while he slept in one of the guest rooms.

At dawn, Olivia rose before the sun. Without exchanging words with Liam, she ate breakfast alone and headed straight to Gregory's studio. Her commitments at Whitmore Holdings were nearly complete, freeing her to focus fully on restoration work.

Olivia's life had transformed remarkably - a stark contrast to her previous existence. Once confined to the role of an ignored wife, she now flourished professionally, juggling projects like Westfield University's promotional video while dividing her time between Whitmore Holdings and Gregory's studio.

In the studio, Olivia retrieved Henry's teapot, eager to restore its simple elegance. She worked diligently through the morning, nearly completing her task when raised voices erupted downstairs.

Tension coiled in her shoulders as Olivia stood, drawn toward the commotion.

"We don't accept work from competitors," Marcus declared heatedly from below.

"Competitors? We're simply clients. Are you admitting you can't handle such a simple job?" A smug young man retorted, flanked by a haughty woman. Both lounged on the sofa, expressions dripping with contempt.

Olivia approached, her gaze falling to the open box before them. At first glance, it appeared empty.

Upon closer inspection, however, it contained countless glass fragments - as if someone had shattered an object and painstakingly ground it to dust. Clearly, they expected the studio to perform a miracle.

"We know your firm accepted this project last month, and now you're dumping it on us? You dare call yourselves mere clients?" Marcus countered, rising to his feet.

He briefly glanced at Olivia before addressing the pair again, scowling. "You're not welcome here!"

"What? Is Gregory not around? Too scared to take the job? We're paying customers," the smug man sneered.

"We're offering premium rates. VIP treatment," the woman added mockingly. "Or is your studio incompetent? Even Gregory can't handle this?"

"There's nothing Gregory can't restore! He's traveling abroad!" Marcus's frustration mounted.

Clearly these two were here to cause trouble, not seek genuine service. Yet turning them away risked damaging the studio's reputation.

Olivia moved closer to examine the glass fragments. Studying the larger pieces, she could visualize the original structure. The slightly opaque, aged glass provided clues to its reconstruction.

"What are you staring at?" the woman snapped, noticing Olivia's intense focus.

With a sneer, she taunted, "Think you can put Humpty Dumpty back together again?"

Olivia met the woman's gaze and signed her response: she could indeed restore it.

"You—" Marcus, understanding Olivia's sign language, looked astonished. "Are you certain?"

Olivia nodded firmly, gesturing she'd happily restore it to protect the studio's reputation, but would equally refuse if that better served their integrity.

Marcus's shock melted into pride. If Olivia believed she could do it, he trusted her completely.

"She says she can fix it," Marcus told the duo. "What's your next move?"

"She can? Who is she?" the smug man asked, surprised.

"Looks like the mute wife from the Blackwood family - just a housewife," the woman sneered, recognizing Olivia with disdain.

Marcus frowned at the insult, but Olivia remained composed. She signed for Marcus to translate: "They don't need to pay VIP rates. Standard fees will suffice. But after restoration, they must promote our services under their company name."

Marcus relayed Olivia's terms.

The duo, clearly here to provoke, looked utterly stunned.

"If she fails, we'll ensure the entire industry and social media know Gregory's Studio is a joke!" the man threatened after a pause.

Without hesitation, Olivia nodded agreement. She carefully lifted the box and moved toward the first-floor workbench.

Though Gregory's designated space, others used it in his absence. Olivia arranged her tools and began systematically sorting the glass pieces.

"This is a five-hundred-year-old antique. Damage it further, and you'll compensate tenfold," the woman warned.

Gregory's Studio had an ironclad policy: failed restorations required ten times market value compensation. Since Gregory instituted this rule, no client had ever received payment - his team never failed.

"Naturally, we honor our policy," Marcus replied coldly.

Olivia stood and signed.

"What's she saying now?" the duo perked up, hoping she'd been intimidated by the penalty.

Marcus scoffed. "She says you're mistaken. This piece is barely two hundred years old."

"Impossible!"

In their stunned silence, Marcus added, "Olivia also requests you stay back and refrain from stealing her techniques."
###Chapter 76

Olivia Sinclair's fiery spirit hadn't surfaced often since her marriage. As a child under Henry Winslow's guidance, she'd been quick with sharp comebacks and carried herself with quiet confidence, silencing anyone who dared challenge her.

But after becoming Mrs. Blackwood, that spark had faded. She'd learned to shrink behind Liam, lowering her gaze to avoid confrontation, swallowing every insult with practiced indifference.

Today was different. As Marcus Whitmore relayed her response to their rude visitors, Olivia sat perched on her work stool, carefully arranging glass fragments. Though seemingly absorbed in her task, the subtle lift at the corners of her mouth betrayed her satisfaction.

This small act of defiance filled Olivia with unexpected lightness. The simple pleasure of standing her ground felt like rediscovering a long-lost part of herself.

Lost in her restoration work, Olivia skipped lunch entirely. The world narrowed to the puzzle before her - first identifying the outline of a Victorian perfume bottle from larger fragments, then meticulously matching smaller pieces using their unique imperfections as guides.

As she worked, Olivia felt an almost spiritual connection to the century-old artifact. With most fragments aligned, she picked up her specialized tools, beginning the delicate process of reassembly, her movements precise and reverent.

When twilight painted the studio windows, Marcus switched on the overhead lights, but Olivia barely noticed. Though she hadn't eaten since breakfast, hunger couldn't compete with the thrill of watching the antique slowly regain its form. This wasn't just about winning a bet - it was the profound satisfaction of giving broken things new life.

"Olivia?" Liam's voice shattered her concentration. She looked up to find him leaning against the doorway, his expression unreadable.

He'd been watching her longer than she realized. When Marcus had noticed Liam's arrival earlier, he'd simply gestured for silence, valuing Olivia's focus over formalities. Surprisingly, Liam hadn't minded waiting.

This was a side of his wife Liam had never seen before. The woman who usually moved through their mansion like a ghost now worked with quiet confidence, her fingers dancing with tweezers as she reconstructed history. The contentment on her face was mesmerizing.

Only the vibration of his phone - a message from Alfred about dinner - broke the spell.

"We should head home," Liam said softly, startling Olivia from her work.

Marcus suddenly remembered Olivia hadn't eaten all day. "You should go. This can wait until tomorrow."

Liam's expression darkened. "Is this how you run your studio? No lunch breaks?"

"My apologies," Marcus murmured, the first time he'd ever apologized to Liam Blackwood.

Olivia quickly intervened, explaining it had been her choice. As she secured the final fragment, the bottle stood nearly complete - still needing finishing touches, but unmistakably whole again.

The same visitors who'd mocked Olivia earlier now stood silent. Taunting a neglected society wife was one thing; challenging someone under Liam Blackwood's protection was another matter entirely.

Methodically cleaning her workspace, Olivia secured the bottle in its case and washed up. Liam waited patiently by the door, an uncharacteristic show of support.

After bidding Marcus goodbye, Olivia tried to pull away when Liam took her hand. "We have guests," he murmured.

Reluctantly, Olivia let him lead her to the car. Today, unusually, Liam had driven himself.

As the engine purred to life, Liam mentioned casually, "I stopped by Whitmore Holdings first. Had to track you down when I realized you weren't there."

Olivia blinked. He'd actually come to pick her up? The exhaustion from her marathon work session made it hard to process this unexpected gesture.

"Did you finish Grandfather's teapot?" Liam asked, his tone curious rather than demanding.

At the next red light, Olivia gestured that it was nearly done.

"Can it hold water now?" There was genuine interest in his voice.

Olivia's expression remained serene as she signed her response: The teapot would never function as it once had. Some breaks couldn't be fully mended, no matter how skilled the restorer.

The next morning found Olivia back at the studio while Liam headed to Blackwood Enterprises. Yet throughout the day, Liam found himself distracted, Olivia's teapot analogy lingering in his mind like an unsolved riddle.

His concentration shattered completely when Sebastian Montgomery burst into his office unannounced. "Mr. Blackwood, there's a viral rumor about your wife circulating online. Should I alert PR?"

"A rumor?" Liam's interest sharpened as he took the tablet.

The screen displayed a trending video showing Olivia laughing intimately with an unidentified man. The caption screamed: "Mrs. Blackwood's Sweet Revenge - Caught in Secret Affair!"
###Chapter 77

Liam's brow furrowed as he watched the viral clip of Olivia's radiant smile - that same smile which had once been his alone, now freely given to another man.

"Mr. Blackwood, the PR team has prepared several crisis management strategies—" Sebastian began, spreading documents across the desk.

Liam held up a hand. "Not yet."

He replayed the footage, studying every frame. Olivia was signing, her expression tender. Though her hands were slightly blurred, Liam recognized the familiar movements. Her message cut deep: "My marriage is miserable. When you marry, choose love, not obligation."

"Is that Alexander she's speaking with?" Liam asked through clenched teeth, though he already knew the answer.

"Indeed," Sebastian confirmed with a nod.

"I see." A dangerous smirk twisted Liam's lips. Olivia had shared intimate details of their marriage with Alexander. While he never doubted her fidelity, this betrayal stung worse than any physical affair.

Sebastian cleared his throat. "Your instructions, sir?"

Liam's gaze remained fixed on the frozen image of Olivia's smiling face. "Find out who orchestrated this."

"I beg your pardon?" Sebastian blinked, expecting orders to remove the video or confront Olivia directly.

"Trace the origin of this trending topic. Identify every account spreading it. Map the entire network." Liam's voice remained eerily calm. "Assemble a dedicated team. I want them working from my office within the hour."

The gravity of the situation finally struck Sebastian. Over the years, countless false rumors had circulated about Liam - minor celebrities seeking clout, business rivals spreading misinformation. Never had he paid them any mind. Yet this first public scandal involving Olivia had halted all other Blackwood Enterprises operations.

Their investigation led inexorably to Victoria Clarke. Despite her attempts to hide behind shell companies, Blackwood's resources uncovered damning evidence - chat logs showing Victoria had paid marketing firms to promote the rumor.

"Victoria is a Hayes by blood. Why would she attack her own cousin and Mrs. Blackwood?" Sebastian mused aloud while presenting the final report.

"Bad blood with Alexander," Liam replied tersely.

The Hayes family's internal strife was no secret. Victoria, wielding considerable influence yet lacking the competence to achieve her ambitions, often resorted to underhanded tactics. Even her limited business dealings had only succeeded through Evelyn's connections - connections Liam himself had facilitated.

As Liam considered Evelyn's potential role in manipulating Victoria, his expression darkened. The possibility that Evelyn might be pulling strings from the shadows couldn't be dismissed.

"Leave the report," Liam ordered coldly.

Managing online rumors was typically straightforward. Even without Liam's intervention, Alexander's PR team could have contained the damage. The real challenge lay in dealing with the mastermind behind it.

After a moment's consideration, Liam forwarded an investigative report about the fire incident directly to the Hayes family patriarch.

Meanwhile, Alexander had already seen the trending rumors and texted Olivia assurances that his PR team was handling the situation. He even offered to explain everything to Liam personally.

Olivia hesitated before responding that no explanation was necessary. She found it difficult to articulate why, but she assumed Liam - so accustomed to media scrutiny - would dismiss this as trivial gossip.

Focusing on work, Olivia prepared for Whitmore Holdings' important client meeting. Though she'd originally planned to skip it due to her speech impairment, not wanting to tarnish the company's image, circumstances demanded her presence.

Isabella returned from the preliminary discussions looking troubled. "Olivia, there's an issue. The clients insist on meeting you personally."

Olivia gestured for clarification.

"They've raised concerns about certain contract details," Isabella explained, handing over marked documents. "Points we couldn't adequately address."

Scanning the pages, Olivia immediately identified the oversight - critical issues she'd somehow missed. These clients were sharp; their questions exposed weaknesses her team couldn't defend.

She signaled her readiness to join the meeting.

"Are you certain you don't need preparation time?" Isabella asked, startled by Olivia's swift decision.

Olivia shook her head firmly. Delay wouldn't help.

Though the documents were incomplete, Olivia had every answer memorized.

Entering the conference room, Olivia nodded politely to the assembled executives.

"This is Olivia Sinclair. She communicates through sign language but understands everything perfectly," Isabella announced. "I'll be interpreting today."

Standing beside Isabella, Olivia fought back nerves. Would she meet Whitmore Holdings' exacting standards?

The clients surprised her with warm smiles.

"We're quite familiar with Ms. Sinclair's exceptional work," one remarked.

"Her restoration projects at Gregory's studio are legendary," another added.

Olivia's eyes widened at their recognition.

Just as she began to relax, the lead client leaned forward. "The question remains - will you uphold Gregory's legacy... or diminish it?"
###Chapter 78

Olivia had grown accustomed to skeptics by now. She remained composed, though Isabella beside her bristled with visible irritation. "You—" Isabella began, but Olivia subtly raised a hand to stop her. Representing Whitmore Holdings demanded absolute professionalism.

With practiced ease, Olivia turned to the clients, her smile warm yet authoritative.

Isabella translated Olivia's graceful hand movements. "Allow me to clarify an important point. The restoration process for calligraphic works depends entirely on the material's condition and damage extent. Severe deterioration makes mounting impossible, requiring alternative techniques."

The clients had been puzzled by vague documentation, but as Olivia elaborated through Isabella's translation, their confusion melted away.

One client exclaimed, "Ah, now I understand! I thought perhaps there'd been an oversight, but your expertise is undeniable!"

Olivia maintained her poised expression as she signed, "I represent Whitmore Holdings, and upholding our reputation is my foremost duty."

After Isabella translated, the client regarded Olivia with newfound respect. "You've completely altered my perception of your company!"

"And how's that?" came an unexpected voice from the doorway. William Hayes himself stood there, impeccably dressed.

Olivia's lips curved into a genuine smile at his arrival. William turned to the client. "Do enlighten me."

The client and William appeared to be old acquaintances. After exchanging pleasantries, the client praised Olivia enthusiastically. "William, I heard you paid a fortune to bring Olivia on board. Initially, I assumed she was just window dressing."

William burst into hearty laughter. "When have I ever made such superficial decisions? You think so little of my judgment?"

"My apologies! Drinks are on me next time!" The older client suddenly seemed deferential in William's presence. "Having witnessed Olivia's skills today, I must say your discernment remains impeccable!"

William beamed at the compliment while Olivia stood quietly, savoring this hard-earned validation. Proving her professional worth meant more than any admiration for her status or appearance could.

After seeing the clients off, William praised Olivia again. "I knew Henry wasn't exaggerating about you! Why else would he specifically ask me to mentor you?"

Olivia's curiosity sparked. She signed to William, "What exactly did Henry tell you? Would you share the details?"

William considered her question before responding, "Why not join me for dinner at my estate? I'll reveal everything then."

Without hesitation, Olivia nodded in agreement.

William instructed his butler to provide Olivia with the details before departing.

Assuming this was merely a casual dinner, Olivia initially decided against mentioning it to Liam. However, reconsidering, she thought transparency might prevent misunderstandings.

When Olivia mentioned the dinner, Liam's brow furrowed. "You're going alone?"

Olivia confirmed, explaining William hadn't specified bringing anyone.

Liam's expression darkened. "This Saturday?"

At her confirmation, Liam's face grew stormy, though he seemed to bite back whatever comment came to mind.

Olivia assumed he was displeased about her solo outing but dismissed it. Liam's opinions mattered less to her with each passing day.

Yet when Saturday arrived and Olivia entered the Hayes mansion, she froze. What she'd anticipated as an intimate dinner was in fact a lavish family gala.

Dressed in a simple black cocktail dress suitable for a private meal, Olivia now stood painfully underdressed amidst the glittering Hayes women in their designer gowns.

Victoria was first to notice her and immediately erupted in cruel laughter. "Look what the cat dragged in! Who let this provincial mouse into our gathering? She must be lost!"

"Being mute clearly affects her fashion sense too!"

"Poor Mr. Blackwood, no wonder he seeks companionship elsewhere. Who could bear having this useless creature at home?"

Victoria's vicious remarks emboldened other relatives to join the mockery, their cruel laughter surrounding Olivia.

"Someone remove her! Where's security? How did she even get past the gates?"
###Chapter 79

"Alexander invited Olivia personally. What's your issue with that?" Victoria and her clique were interrupted by a commanding voice. It was Alexander Hayes, descending the grand staircase with effortless grace.

Alexander's status among the Whitmore heirs was undeniable. The room instantly hushed at his presence.

His words detonated like an explosion. Olivia Sinclair had been personally summoned by William Hayes himself. The crowd suddenly remembered Olivia's prestigious role as consultant for Whitmore Holdings, with that staggering compensation package.

The same people who'd been mocking Olivia moments ago now paled, hastily distancing themselves from Victoria. Some even began shooting her disapproving glances.

Cornered and humiliated, Victoria's face twisted as the silence around her thickened.

Ignoring her discomfort, Alexander approached Olivia. "Grandfather is expecting you. Let's proceed to the study."

His announcement sent shockwaves through the gathering. William Hayes was waiting for Olivia in his private study - a privilege rarely granted to anyone, let alone someone outside the family.

"Is she dating Alexander?" someone whispered after Olivia departed.

"Don't be absurd! She's Liam's wife!" another countered.

"Ah, so she's favored because she's Mrs. Blackwood."

"But haven't you heard? Liam and Olivia are having problems. Rumor has it he's been seen with Evelyn Hartley frequently."

As realization dawned about William's high regard for Olivia, the crowd turned on Victoria.

"Victoria, are you deliberately tarnishing the Whitmore name? We won't tolerate such disgraceful behavior!"

"Olivia outranks you at Whitmore Holdings! How dare you speak to her like that?"

"Clearly Victoria hasn't learned from Grandfather's last reprimand. Now she's targeting Olivia again."

"Perhaps she needs psychiatric evaluation. Someone should arrange a mental health check!"

Overwhelmed by her family's sudden condemnation, Victoria burned with rage and humiliation. She nearly bolted upstairs to confront Olivia directly.

At the end of the second-floor corridor stood William's study. Following Alexander, Olivia experienced déjà vu at how similar the layout was to Henry Winslow's private office.

"Grandfather, Olivia is here," Alexander announced, holding the door open for her before discreetly closing it behind her.

Olivia offered William a warm smile and respectful nod.

"Come in, my dear!" William greeted her enthusiastically. After seating her, he gestured to an array of delicacies. "I wasn't certain what young people enjoy these days, so I had these prepared specially. Please, indulge yourself."

The gourmet treats were clearly selected with care, bringing a delighted smile to Olivia's face as she expressed silent gratitude.

Even Alexander didn't enjoy such private audiences with William, making Olivia increasingly curious about what discussions William had shared with Henry in the past.

"Olivia, you might assume my generosity stems from Henry, but that's only partially true," William began carefully. "Your exceptional skills warrant both the compensation and special treatment. You're far more capable than any of my disappointing grandchildren! Do you understand my meaning?"

Olivia nodded gratefully while subtly indicating her curiosity about Henry's revelations to William.

"I know you're curious. Be patient, and I'll explain everything," William said, motioning for her to relax. "You're wondering what Henry told me previously, and truthfully, it's quite straightforward."

Olivia's eyes widened slightly in anticipation.

"I owe Henry a life debt, just as Henry owed your biological grandfather," William explained, pausing to sip his drink thoughtfully. "Your grandfather - whom I never met - saved Henry's life. Without his intervention, Henry wouldn't have survived. Does that clarify matters?"

Olivia was stunned. She'd always believed herself an orphan without any family legacy.

"Henry once saved my life as well. You know about his chronic knee injury from wartime shrapnel?" William tapped his temple meaningfully. "That shrapnel was meant for me. It would have pierced my skull if Henry hadn't intervened."

"Henry didn't just provide financial support when my family struggled. He literally saved my life. So when he asked for this favor, how could I refuse? I'd never face him in the afterlife if I failed you," William continued, voice thick with emotion.

Tears welled in Olivia's eyes as she nodded understanding.

"But-" William hesitated, his expression darkening with regret. "I failed you in another way. I allowed you to suffer after marrying Liam-"

Olivia quickly gestured that he bore no blame.

William's face clouded with guilt. "I should have checked on you. After your marriage, I never inquired about your wellbeing. Even when rumors spread about Liam and Evelyn, and people pitied you for enduring it, I did nothing... That failure is mine."

Olivia shook her head emphatically, signing: "Marriages are complex. You can't blame yourself. Besides, I wasn't unhappy before."

She paused, then added decisively that she'd chosen to divorce Liam, and knowing William supported her was enough.

"What? You're considering divorcing Liam?" William's eyes widened in shock.
###Chapter 80

Olivia nodded but instantly wished she hadn't confided in William. She knew Liam's temper all too well.

Still, she trusted William to keep her secret. After a hesitant pause, she continued signing, "I even requested a twenty-million-dor advance on my sry to satisfy Liam's demands. He claims I must pay him twenty million if I want the divorce."

William's reaction was immediate and explosive. He slammed his fist against the armrest. "After all his scandals, that bastard still dares to extort money from you for a divorce? The audacity!"

Olivia quickly grasped William's hand, shaking her head while signing that she'd been the one to choose this marriage.

William exhaled sharply. "Fine... But let me remind you - Henry entrusted Liam with your care, and he's failed spectacularly! If Henry were alive today, he'd be rolling in his grave!"

Olivia offered a bitter smile, signing her firm decision that she couldn't endure this marriage any longer.

"That's my girl," William said, his voice softening with pride. "I'm relieved you've finally made this decision. You have my full support!"

His expression grew serious. "There's something else."

William stood abruptly and moved to his desk, shuffling through documents before producing one. "I'm giving you a property."

Olivia rushed forward in protest.

But William remained firm. "Don't argue. I promised Henry I'd look after you, and I owe him my life. Do you really think my life is worth less than some house?"

Seeing his determination, Olivia reluctantly epted.

"You don't owe me anything, Olivia. I owe Henry, and by extension, I owe you. Understood?"

She wanted to refuse such generosity, but William's stubbornness left her no choice but to ept with gratitude.

"Excellent. Once I find the perfect property and prepare it, you'll receive the keys. If trouble arises, you'll always have a safe haven."

This unexpected gift solved Olivia's most pressing concern. After divorcing Liam, returning to the Blackwood estate was impossible, and her only n had been temporary refuge with Natalie. Now William had provided a permanent solution.

Yet Olivia worried Liam might retaliate against the Hayes family over this.

As she prepared to voice her concern, William stood abruptly. "Enough serious talk - let's go down for dinner."

The moment passed, and Olivia shelved her worries for now.

Descending the staircase together, they found the younger family members lined up in formal attire, offering respectful greetings.

Olivia instinctively retreated under their sudden attention.

William patted her arm reassuringly. "Rx," he whispered.

Then, addressing the room with a chuckle: "It's just a family dinner, not a royal ball! You're all dressed like we're hosting the Queen!"

"Grandfather, we simply wish to show our respect," one rtive chimed in, sparking a chorus of agreement.

"As long as it pleases you, that's what matters!"

The younger family members quickly clustered around William, vying for his attention.

Only Victoria remained apart, her dark eyes burning with jealousy as they fixed on Olivia.

"Grandfather!" Victoria's sharp voice cut through the pleasantries. "Olivia's deceiving you! Don't trust her act!"

The room plunged into tense silence. Everyone remembered the last family gathering where Victoria had tried humiliating Olivia, only to be pped by William.

Now, with Victoria attacking again, all eyes turned to William. Would he side with his blood relative, shifting family dynamics? Or would he defend Olivia, cementing her position?

The tension thickened until William finally spoke.

He didn't address Victoria's usations or demand explanations. His words were simple and cutting: "Didn't you learn from last time?"

"Grandfather, please let me exin—" Victoria began.

"Perhaps you should hear Victoria out," whispered some of her supporters, hoping to see Olivia's downfall.

"Do you take me for a fool?" William's voice turned icy. "Am I too senile to distinguish truth from lies? Must I rely on your judgment?"

His anger shocked the room, a stark contrast to his earlier cheerfulness. He fixed Victoria with a piercing re. "I intended to speak with you after dinner, but since you've chosen to make a scene now, we'll settle this immediately."

Victoria paled.

"Grandfather, I—"

But it was toote.

William's voice boomed. "You orchestrated that bookstore fire that nearly killed Olivia, didn't you? And you spread those vile rumors online about Olivia cheating with Alexander behind Liam's back. Did you think I wouldn't discover the truth? Did you think I lacked proof?"
###Chapter 81

Olivia Sinclair stood frozen as William Hayes finished his damning speech. Her breath caught in her throat, eyes widening in shock.

How had William uncovered all this? Did he know about Victoria Clarke's involvement in the arson and cyberbullying? Had he been conducting his own investigation? Was it William, not Alexander, who had silenced the online rumors?

Olivia's fingers trembled as she stared at the elderly patriarch, her mind racing with possibilities.

Across the room, Victoria had turned deathly pale. Her manicured nails dug into her palms as she gasped. "Grandfather, who fed you these lies? None of this is true! I would never—"

"Lies?" William's voice boomed through the grand hall. "I have proof! Do you take me for a senile old man who can't distinguish truth from fiction?"

Victoria's carefully applied makeup couldn't hide her panic.

"Rafael!" William called to his butler. "Fetch the dossier from my study desk immediately."

The butler bowed and hurried upstairs.

Victoria's knees nearly buckled. She knew apologies wouldn't work now. William's temper was legendary in the Whitmore family. Her only chance was discrediting the evidence.

"Grandfather, ask Olivia!" Victoria suddenly cried, pointing at her rival. "Does she truly believe I'm capable of such things? She's framing me because of my friendship with Evelyn!"

The mention of Evelyn Hartley made several family members exchange glances.

"Olivia," Victoria challenged, forcing confidence into her shaking voice. "Can you actually prove any of these accusations?"

She prayed Olivia hadn't gathered concrete evidence. Maybe there was still a way out.

Tears streamed down Victoria's cheeks as she turned pleading eyes to William. To an outsider, she might have appeared the victim.

But William Hayes wasn't easily fooled. His sharp gaze shifted to Olivia, softening slightly. "Do you believe these allegations hold merit?"

All eyes turned to Olivia.

Victoria's desperate stare held silent threats, warning Olivia not to cross her. She'd already decided—if Olivia betrayed her now, she'd run straight to Evelyn. Evelyn would twist the story to Liam Blackwood, and Liam would make Olivia pay.

But Olivia no longer cared about Liam's reactions. Her resolve hardened as she gestured to William that while she hadn't collected proof herself, Victoria's hostility since their first meeting spoke volumes.

William interpreted Olivia's silent response for the room. "Olivia is my honored guest. Any matter concerning her will be investigated personally by me. Victoria, you will answer for your actions."

Victoria trembled, realizing too late that Olivia had ignored her silent threats.

Rafael returned with a leather portfolio.

"Charles!" William barked at Victoria's father.

Charles Hayes stepped forward, his face ashen. His entire body shook, but he couldn't refuse the family patriarch.

"Read it aloud," William commanded. "Let everyone hear."

Despite the late hour, no one dared mention dinner. The tension was palpable.

Charles's voice quavered as he began. "The... the bookstore fire... Police reports indicate—"

"Louder!" William snapped. "Or has hunger stolen your voice?"

Terrified, Charles raised his volume.

The documents painted a damning picture. Even those unaware of the details quickly understood.

The arsonists—hired thugs—had been apprehended. Their testimonies matched perfectly: they'd been hired by Victoria's personal assistant.

The assistant had cracked under questioning, providing message logs and bank transfers linking directly to Victoria. Audio recordings even captured Victoria instructing her assistant to commit the crime.

The investigation also exposed Victoria's role in hiring internet trolls to defame Olivia and Alexander.

With the evidence laid bare, Charles erupted. "How could I have raised such a monster? Did you inherit this wickedness from your mother?"

Charles had remarried after divorcing Victoria's mother.

"Father, please," Victoria begged, falling to her knees. "I made terrible mistakes—"

"You're an adult," Charles said coldly. "Face the consequences."

With a new wife and young son to consider, Charles couldn't afford William's displeasure. Protecting Victoria would jeopardize their future.

"Olivia!" Victoria suddenly turned, crawling toward her rival. "Please, I'm begging you!"

Her voice dropped to a desperate whisper. "I admit everything. You're a good person—forgive me? I'll tell you all of Evelyn's secrets! I'll help you separate her from Liam!"

###Chapter 82

Olivia instinctively retreated, her eyes locked on Victoria from across the room. There was a time when such an offer might have swayed her, but those days were long gone. She couldn't care less about who Liam was seeing now.

"Grandfather, are we absolutely sure this evidence isn't fabricated?" Victoria wasn't completely abandoned yet. A few voices still dared to speak in her defense. "Grandfather, this seems like circumstantial evidence at best—"

"Preposterous!" William thundered, silencing the dissenters with a glare. "Do you realize who provided this evidence? Liam Blackwood himself!"

The room fell into stunned silence.

Though Liam was Olivia's husband, no one would dare question his credibility or suggest he'd falsify evidence against Victoria just to protect Olivia. Everyone knew their marriage was far from perfect.

When Olivia learned Liam was behind the evidence, her breath caught. Had he anticipated today's confrontation? She remembered the complicated look in his eyes when she mentioned attending the Hayes family dinner. Now she understood what that look had meant.

"Grandfather, regardless of everything, Victoria is still your granddaughter, still part of the Hayes family," a woman pleaded, still advocating for Victoria. "Since she's admitted her wrongdoing, shouldn't we give her a chance to redeem herself?"

Only one person remained by Victoria's side now—this distant cousin whose connection to the Hayes family existed solely through Victoria. Without her, she'd be cast out completely.

"She orchestrated an arson attempt, and you suggest we give her a chance?" William scoffed derisively. "She tried to take a life! If you're so eager to defend her, perhaps you'd like to share her punishment!"

The woman immediately fell silent, all courage draining from her.

William's voice cut through the tension like a blade. "Let me make one thing perfectly clear. Olivia is now my sworn granddaughter. I will protect her with everything at my disposal. Anyone who crosses her, answers to me."

Turning to Olivia, his tone softened slightly. "Olivia, remember this—no matter who tries to harm you in the future, my door is always open to you."

His words didn't just reassure Olivia—they served as a public declaration that she now had the full weight of the Hayes family behind her.

The atmosphere in the room shifted palpably. The way everyone looked at Olivia transformed from mere curiosity about the newcomer to genuine respect and admiration.

It was rare for William to show such open affection to anyone in the family—even Alexander, whom he occasionally praised for his business acumen. This public display of warmth toward Olivia was unprecedented.

Facing Charles, William spoke gravely. "Charles, now that my position is clear, how do you propose we handle your daughter's situation?"

Without hesitation, Charles replied, "She is no daughter of mine!"

His words made it clear he wouldn't sacrifice his and his son's future to save Victoria.

"Father! How could you?" Victoria wailed, tears streaming down her face, but Charles shoved her away harshly. "You dare speak after what you've done? Your grandfather is right—you're a danger to society!" He yanked out his phone. "I'm calling the police. You're going to prison! I'm done trying to discipline you. Let the justice system teach you some manners!"

With Victoria officially cast out, the family banquet commenced.

Almost immediately, Olivia found herself surrounded. Every face bore either genuine admiration or sycophantic smiles as they vied for her attention. Some even attempted rudimentary sign language, desperate to impress.

"Alright everyone, give her some space," Alexander interjected, noticing Olivia's discomfort.

He chuckled, "Olivia and I go way back. If you want to get close to her, you'll have to get in line!"

"How selfish of you! Why didn't you introduce us to someone as remarkable as Olivia sooner?"

"I nearly majored in archaeology in college! Olivia and I must have so much in common!"

These were the same people who'd looked down on Olivia when she first arrived at the Hayes estate. Now they showered her with flattery, suddenly recalling all her interests and accomplishments.

The banquet proceeded in high spirits, with Olivia as the guest of honor seated right beside William.

Even as the event wound down, people kept approaching her nonstop.

"If you all keep this up, I might have to start handing out numbers," Alexander teased, seeing their eagerness. "There will be plenty of opportunities to get to know Olivia. Why the rush tonight?"

Amused, Olivia shook her head with a gentle smile, indicating she didn't mind.

Just then, Liam arrived to pick Olivia up. He saw her smiling—not at him, but at another man.

A dark expression crossed his face as he strode over and grasped Olivia's wrist. "My wife is my responsibility," he declared, his commanding presence making the crowd instinctively give them space.

William's voice cut through the tension. "Liam, a moment."

Emerging from the crowd with a smile, William fixed Liam with a knowing look.

"Mr. Hayes," Liam acknowledged respectfully.

"I've made it clear to everyone today that Olivia is now my sworn granddaughter," William announced, clapping Liam on the shoulder. "You'll be taking good care of her from now on!"

Both Liam and Olivia were startled by his words. The moment felt eerily reminiscent of the past, before their marriage, when Henry had expressed similar sentiments.

Sadly, Liam had failed to live up to those expectations.

"I understand," Liam responded solemnly. "You have nothing to worry about."

William turned to Olivia and presented her with a set of keys. "This is the townhouse I've arranged for you. From today onward, it's yours. Move in whenever you're ready."

Olivia, taken by surprise, instinctively glanced at Liam. He now knew about the property. How would he react?
###Chapter 83

The sun was just beginning to set when Olivia received the unexpected call. William had promised to notify her when the Newport estate was ready, but she'd anticipated weeks of preparation - not mere hours.

The weight of the keys pressed into her palm as Liam's piercing gaze burned into her. She hesitated, but William's firm grip closed her fingers around the metal.

"Consider this my promise," William declared, his words carrying a clear challenge to Liam. "You'll always have my protection."

Liam's jaw tightened visibly, his knuckles whitening around the steering wheel. "She needs no one's protection but mine," he countered through clenched teeth.

The tension hung thick in the air until William finally stepped back with a satisfied nod.

Once inside the car, Liam drove in silence for exactly seventeen minutes before abruptly pulling onto the shoulder. Olivia's pulse quickened as she felt his intense stare.

"What exactly does William know?" The question came out sharper than intended. "Did you tell him?"

Olivia bit her lip. She couldn't admit William not only knew about her desire for divorce but actively supported it. Instead, she shook her head, focusing on the passing headlights.

"And yet he defends you?" Liam's voice dropped dangerously low. "Haven't I given you everything? Why would you need his protection?"

It was true - unlimited credit cards, couture wardrobes, jewels beyond measure. Liam had provided every material possession imaginable.

Yet he'd withheld the one thing she truly wanted - his heart. His public affairs and emotional distance spoke louder than any luxury ever could.

Before she could respond, a memory surfaced. She gestured her gratitude for his help gathering evidence earlier that day.

Her expression held pure thankfulness - nothing more. No lingering affection, no wifely devotion. Just simple appreciation.

Something in Liam snapped.

In one fluid motion, he unbuckled his seatbelt and captured her lips in a searing kiss. Olivia initially resisted, which only made him press harder.

Then suddenly, she stopped fighting.

The kiss deepened, and Olivia let her mind go blank, surrendering to the moment.

Just as abruptly, Liam pulled away, studying her face with unnerving intensity.

Olivia struggled to compose herself, unwilling to reveal how much the kiss had affected her.

What Liam saw in her eyes made his blood run cold. Not passion, not love - just that same damned gratitude from before. As if his affection was merely repayment for a favor.

With a muttered curse, he slammed back into his seat and restarted the engine. "Where to?" he asked icily. "The Blackwood estate? Or your new Whitmore property?"

The accelerator met the floorboard as they sped through the night.

Somehow, Olivia found herself back at their mansion. She sat frozen even after unbuckling, wary of his volatile mood.

"Come to Mother's birthday gala with me." The invitation came suddenly, his voice rough.

Just days ago, Olivia had vowed never to endure Margaret Winslow's cruelty again. She opened her mouth to refuse.

"This time will be different." Liam cut her off. "I've spoken to her. I know how she treated you."

Olivia's eyes widened. Apparently Liam had visited the estate and learned from Adrian about Margaret's abuse.

Her hands trembled as she signed her question - why?

"Why what?" Liam frowned.

Why the sudden change? Why now?

Liam actually chuckled at her confusion. "Because you're my wife. Isn't it natural I'd protect you?"

Olivia barely suppressed her disbelief. Since when had Liam Blackwood ever behaved naturally as a husband? Yet she simply nodded, storing her doubts away.

After William publicly named Olivia as his god-granddaughter, her status at Whitmore Holdings transformed overnight. Where colleagues once offered polite nods, they now bowed with near reverence. Distant Hayes relatives suddenly materialized in her path, eager to claim connection.

The attention made Olivia's skin crawl. She wanted respect earned through merit, not inherited through title.

Determination set her jaw. She would prove herself worthy through work alone.

One particularly long afternoon, just as the elevator doors began closing, a woman rushed inside - the same one who'd staunchly defended Victoria at the recent Whitmore gala.

"Olivia!" The woman gasped for breath. "I'm Cassandra Blake. My great-aunt married into the Whitmore family ages ago."

Olivia studied her with open skepticism. The tenuous family link meant nothing, and Cassandra's earnest demeanor reminded her uncomfortably of Victoria.

"I owe you an apology," Cassandra continued. "For myself and for Victoria. Could you ever forgive us?"

The elevator continued its ascent, the silence stretching between them. Olivia weighed her response carefully, unaware of the storm brewing just floors above.
###Chapter 84

"I accept your apology and forgive you." Olivia typed into her phone and read the message aloud for Cassandra.

Though forgiveness was Olivia's to give, the decision to punish Victoria rested entirely with William, and Olivia held no influence over Victoria's fate. Yet Cassandra clearly sought more than mere forgiveness. Her face lit up at Olivia's quick response. "Thank you, Olivia! You're absolutely amazing! Could you possibly help me with one more thing?"

As Cassandra's eagerness intensified, Olivia instinctively retreated a step, bracing for another request.

Cassandra grabbed Olivia's hand, desperation thickening her voice. "Could you speak to William on my behalf? Even if you don't defend Victoria directly, just say something kind about me. Please?"

Seeing Olivia's hesitation, Cassandra hastily added, "The Hayes family member married to my mother's aunt is Victoria's father's cousin. If Victoria falls from grace, I'll lose my standing within the Hayes family. You, being adopted by the Blackwood family, must understand the importance of family support, right? I'm desperate. Imagine how helpless I'd be if they cast me out alongside Victoria!"

Cassandra's plea tugged at Olivia's heartstrings but clashed with her principles. Olivia had become a Blackwood not by choice but because tragedy had claimed her family. Given the choice, she'd trade all wealth and status for one more moment with her loved ones.

Olivia shook her head, rejecting Cassandra's plea with another message. "I can't do that. William wouldn't approve."

"But he adores you! You don't understand how harsh he is with the younger generation. He doesn't warm to any of the kids, no matter their lineage! It's practically unheard of for him to take a liking to someone like you!"

Olivia knew William's eccentricities well. When she'd first accompanied Liam to the Hayes family estate, William had called her Mrs. Blackwood, clearly not recognizing her.

Back then, Olivia had seemed insignificant. Despite instructions for William to look after her, he'd barely acknowledged her presence, as she appeared to lack any qualities worth his attention. Only after observing Olivia's ambition and determination had William begun offering support.

Olivia understood why William's stance had changed. No one rushes to help those who've surrendered to despair. Had she resigned herself to misfortune without seeking assistance, no one could've saved her. William's fondness wasn't what others assumed.

Olivia typed firmly, "Sorry, I truly can't help you. Don't waste your breath trying to convince me. It's pointless."

"Olivia!" Cassandra's voice cracked with frustration after the rejection. "Victoria may have made mistakes, but you shouldn't corner her! Circumstances change! Just because William favors you now doesn't guarantee it'll last! What if Alexander falls? Aren't you worried about the consequences for yourself?"

Olivia remained unmoved. She kept herself detached from the Hayes family's internal conflicts, focusing solely on her responsibilities.

"If you help, I'll compensate you. I know you refuse Liam's money—" Cassandra offered desperately.

A pang of sadness struck Olivia. That she declined Liam's financial support was a secret known only to Liam himself, not even to Margaret. Cassandra's knowledge meant Liam had shared this with Evelyn, who must have told Victoria. Their private matters had become gossip fodder and even leverage.

Olivia's expression hardened. She stopped typing and instead conveyed refusal through sign language, her gaze briefly flicking to the elevator controls.

The elevator continued ascending strangely—it shouldn't take this long to reach her floor.

Upon closer inspection, Olivia realized her mistake. She'd forgotten to press her floor button. The elevator rose because someone upstairs had summoned it.

Olivia reached for the button, but Cassandra seized her arm, expression darkening.

"Olivia, don't push me! Just talk to William! Even if he ignores it, at least I tried! How can you be so heartless? You owe your position to the Blackwoods, yet refuse to help others?"

Olivia desperately wanted to clarify the misunderstanding, but Cassandra's iron grip made it impossible.

As Olivia considered acquiescing just to escape, the elevator halted.

The doors slid open to reveal Alexander about to enter when he witnessed the tense scene.

"Cassandra!" Alexander barked, fury evident. "What the hell are you doing? Release her immediately!"

"Alexander—" Cassandra turned, face etched with regret, but Alexander remained unconvinced.

With one glance, Alexander grasped the situation. Swiftly, he dialed security. "Revoke Cassandra's building access! Send someone to the 17th floor now to escort her out!"

"Alexander—" Cassandra tried to interject, but Alexander yanked her arm, forcibly removing her from the elevator.

Alexander then pressed his floor button and assisted Olivia with hers. "Did she scare you?"

Olivia simply shook her head, choosing not to discuss Cassandra's actions, and reassured him she was fine.

Meanwhile, Cassandra, now disheveled from the ejection, trudged to a waiting car where Victoria and Evelyn sat.

"Olivia refused, then Alexander appeared and threw me out," Cassandra muttered, head lowered.

Victoria swore under her breath, turning to Evelyn. "Evelyn, I never betrayed you. You must help me!"

"Don't worry," Evelyn soothed. "The real issue is Olivia, and she heeds Liam's advice. And Liam is utterly devoted to his mother."

Evelyn chuckled lightly. "Relax, Liam's mother has a birthday gala soon. I'll humiliate Olivia there. After that, she won't have a single ally left!"
###Chapter 85

Olivia's birthday soon arrived.

For the first time, Olivia Sinclair crossed the threshold of the Blackwood mansion not as a servant but as an honored guest.

Accompanied by Liam, Olivia couldn't shake off the butterflies in her stomach. She wore an emerald green gown Liam had personally selected, while he sported a matching silk tie. Their coordinated outfits silently declared their relationship to everyone present.

As they entered the grand foyer, Liam's strong fingers intertwined with Olivia's, making the once-familiar estate feel strangely foreign.

"Liam's here!" Margaret's voice rang through the marble halls, followed by another that made Olivia's spine stiffen. Evelyn.

"Liam, you're finally here," Evelyn cooed, her arm linked possessively with Margaret's. Both women wore matching smiles that didn't reach their eyes. Evelyn's lavender dress perfectly complemented Margaret's deep violet gown - a calculated choice that had clearly pleased the older woman. Margaret's smile vanished the moment she noticed Olivia.

Forcing a polite smile, Olivia offered her greetings.

"Liam, you wouldn't believe how invaluable Evelyn has been lately," Margaret gushed, deliberately ignoring Olivia's presence. "She's absolutely brilliant at everything!"

"From guest lists to vendor coordination, she's outperformed even our most experienced event planners!" Margaret continued, her voice dripping with admiration.

Olivia kept her head slightly bowed, a familiar numbness spreading through her chest. When Margaret needed Evelyn, it was for social planning. But when she summoned Olivia, it was always as a servant.

"Don't we have staff for these tasks?" Liam's voice cut through the praise.

Rather than joining in the adulation, Liam asked pointedly, "You're having guests do unpaid labor? That seems rather inappropriate."

Margaret's face flushed crimson. "What nonsense are you—"

Evelyn quickly interjected, "It's no trouble, Liam. I'm happy to help your mother—"

"If you need assistance, I can arrange professional event coordinators from my company," Liam offered coolly, his expression unreadable.

"Enough!" Margaret snapped, realizing her plan had backfired. She cleared her throat awkwardly and tried to pull Liam toward Evelyn, away from Olivia.

But Liam stood firm. "Why are you dragging me? Doesn't Evelyn have you covered? Are you feeling unwell? Do you need two people to hold you up?"

"You're impossible!" Margaret exclaimed, glaring at her stubborn son.

Olivia looked up at Liam in surprise. His complete disregard for Evelyn's feelings puzzled her. Why was he acting this way?

Olivia had assumed Evelyn's presence signaled her acceptance into the Blackwood family, possibly heralding an engagement announcement. Seeing Evelyn had made Olivia feel like a pawn in some cruel game. So why had Liam insisted she come? Yet here he was, shielding her from humiliation.

Still dazed, Olivia followed Liam into the formal living area.

"Liam, it's been too long," Richard greeted his brother, standing beside his wife Catherine.

Richard had managed the family's European operations for years and rarely visited. Olivia had only encountered him during major family events like Margaret's birthday.

Though Olivia had lived with the Blackwoods for five years, her interactions with Richard were minimal. Her relationship with Catherine was equally distant - they barely exchanged words beyond polite greetings.

This visit proved different.

After greeting Liam, Richard turned to Olivia. "Olivia, you've been making waves! News of your accomplishments reached me in Paris!"

Olivia stiffened, and Catherine quickly added with a sneer, "Yes, embarrassing yourself publicly! Who do you think you are?"

But Richard's intent wasn't to mock Olivia. Ignoring his wife's jab, he continued with genuine admiration, "I've always known about your talents. I worried you might lose your edge, but you're more impressive than ever."

Catherine's expression soured, and even Margaret looked at Richard in shock.

Olivia was too stunned to respond immediately. Was Richard actually complimenting her?

"Your restoration work is exceptional. I still remember when Gregory Thornton praised your skills during his visit. I was there that day," Richard continued warmly.

"When you married Liam, I feared you might set aside your talents, but you've clearly maintained your skills! I've heard about your projects at Gregory's studio and with Whitmore Holdings from overseas! One of my clients mentioned—" Richard's praise seemed endless.

"Alright—" Catherine, noticing Margaret's growing irritation, tugged at her husband's sleeve.

Unaware, Richard turned to Catherine for confirmation, "Isn't that right? You're here witnessing everything firsthand. Isn't Olivia remarkable?"

Catherine shot a glance at Margaret. Reluctant to praise Olivia but unable to contradict her husband, she gave a tight nod. "Yes, quite."

"You certainly keep up with domestic affairs. How... thorough of you." Margaret forced a brittle smile. Her love for her sons prevented open confrontation with Richard.

Thus, Margaret reluctantly added her own strained compliments as the group moved toward the dining room, leaving Evelyn behind.

Watching Olivia's retreating figure, Evelyn clenched her fists, her eyes burning with bitter resentment.
###Chapter 86

Margaret Winslow's birthday celebration was divided into two distinct parts. The morning belonged exclusively to the Winslow family, while the afternoon welcomed their elite social circle.

As they stepped into the grand foyer, Richard and Catherine were the first to present their gifts.

"Mother, this is for you," Richard declared, offering an elegant velvet box. "The rare pink diamond you've coveted for years. I pulled every string to acquire it."

Margaret's face glowed with delight as she lifted the lid, immediately replacing her existing necklace with the dazzling new jewel.

"Exquisite," Margaret breathed, admiring her reflection. "Richard, you always know my heart's desires."

"Margaret, my gift awaits," Catherine interjected smoothly, presenting a lacquered case. "Nine flawless South Sea pearls." Tradition dictated that couples presented joint gifts, making this separate offering unexpected.

The deviation from protocol caught Olivia off guard. She and Liam had prepared a single gift together, and now she feared appearing thoughtless.

Liam seemed unperturbed. He approached Margaret confidently with their shared present. "Olivia and I selected this for you," he announced.

Margaret accepted the gift but couldn't resist a barbed comment. "This must be your doing, Liam! Surely Olivia has her own token for me?" Her sharp gaze pinned Olivia in place.

Olivia felt the trap closing around her. The sudden rule change reeked of manipulation. Had Catherine not broken tradition, she knew Margaret would have criticized her for grandstanding.

"This represents both of us," Liam stated firmly, shielding Olivia.

"Very well. I see Olivia couldn't be bothered," Margaret sniffed, rolling her eyes dramatically.

"Margaret, happy birthday! May your year overflow with joy." Evelyn appeared at that moment, presenting an ornate box right after Liam. The seamless transition made Olivia feel like an intruder in their carefully choreographed performance.

"Darling Evelyn!" Margaret exclaimed, embracing the younger woman as if she were the true daughter-in-law.

Olivia instinctively retreated, contemplating an early exit.

But Margaret wasn't finished. Her disdainful gaze raked over Olivia. "Observe Evelyn's thoughtfulness. Five years in this family, Olivia, and what have you contributed besides spending Winslow money? Now you're trading on our family name!"

The tirade continued until even typically reserved Richard intervened. "Mother, this is a celebration. Let's maintain the festive spirit."

"I simply can't tolerate her exploiting Liam!" Margaret exploded. Olivia's heart turned to ice with each cruel word. After everything, was this how they saw her? A mere opportunist?

Liam decided to address the elephant in the room. "Mother," he began, voice steel-edged.

Margaret attempted to steer the conversation toward managing Olivia. "Liam, we really must discuss—"

But Liam cut her off. "We need to talk about how you've treated Olivia."

Margaret recoiled at his icy tone. "What nonsense is this?"

"Did you force her to kneel and scrub floors? Treat her like household staff?" Liam's accusatory questions hung in the air.

Olivia looked up, stunned by his defense.

Flustered, Margaret deflected. "Who's been filling your head with lies? Don't listen to Olivia's fabrications."

"I didn't need to hear it. I have photographic evidence," Liam countered.

Olivia's breath caught. Who had documented Margaret's cruelty? Or was this a strategic bluff?

"At such a joyous occasion, Liam—" Catherine attempted damage control.

Liam remained unmoved. "Richard called this joyful while Mother berates Olivia. I think the timing's perfect."

Margaret's expression darkened. She enjoyed tormenting Olivia but hated being challenged. Clearing her throat, she muttered, "I was merely instructing her. Nothing consequential."

Liam stood his ground. "She's done nothing wrong. Your persecution must end."

"How dare you! Is this how you see your own mother?" Margaret shrieked.

"I don't want to believe it, but the evidence speaks for itself," Liam stated coldly.

Producing his phone, Liam displayed damning proof—photos, videos, detailed timelines. Margaret's mouth opened and closed like a stranded fish.

Faced with irrefutable evidence, Margaret turned livid. "You're interrogating me like a common criminal!"

Unmoved, Liam delivered his verdict: "You will apologize to Olivia."
###Chapter 87

"Liam, please. It's Margaret's birthday. Don't argue with her today." Catherine intervened, sensing the rising tension and Margaret's darkening expression.

"But she provoked this," Liam countered firmly. "She committed an unforgivable act yet refuses to accept criticism."

Catherine fell silent, overwhelmed by Liam's sharp retort. She glanced helplessly at Richard, silently begging for intervention.

To her surprise, Richard turned to Margaret with disbelief. "Mother, is this true? Did you really mistreat Olivia? You've never treated Catherine this way. What's changed? You used to be so patient."

"I did nothing wrong! I've always treated Catherine well!" Margaret snapped, her voice rising with indignation.

The atmosphere grew increasingly volatile. Olivia stood silently at the center, never expecting Liam to defend her so fiercely or demand an apology from Margaret.

But none of it mattered now. She longed for divorce, for freedom from this toxic environment. The pain she'd endured couldn't be undone by mere words. Even if Margaret knelt to scrub floors as Olivia once had, it wouldn't change anything.

Gently tugging Liam's sleeve, Olivia conveyed with her eyes that no apology was necessary.

Margaret caught the gesture and understood.

This wasn't about forgiveness. Olivia's gaze held pity - as if she stood above Margaret, completely indifferent to the situation.

The realization stoked Margaret's fury. Yet despite her rage, she knew Liam wouldn't support her. He'd chosen Olivia's side, leaving her powerless.

Summoning her acting skills, Margaret blinked back tears. "I was wrong before."

Approaching Olivia, Margaret took her hand. "I only wanted what's best for Liam. I worried you couldn't care for him properly, so I tried to teach you household management. My methods were... misguided."

Olivia's expression remained neutral. Margaret's apology sounded like empty justification for cruelty.

She was tired of dwelling on the past. Liam had already done enough, especially confronting Evelyn earlier.

Olivia forced a polite smile.

"Have you forgiven me, Olivia?" Margaret pressed, seeking closure.

Olivia met her gaze but didn't nod. Forgiveness was impossible.

Margaret had once forced Olivia to kneel and scrub floors, then "accidentally" stepped on her hands. When Olivia cried out, Margaret twisted the story, claiming she'd been cursed and ordering the maid to strike her.

In those moments of agony, Olivia wondered how Henry would have reacted to such cruelty. She could never forgive such malice.

"Olivia?" Margaret repeated, squeezing her hand tighter.

Olivia remained still - neither accepting nor rejecting the apology.

"That's enough," Liam declared, pulling Olivia to his side.

"Liam, I've apologized but she—" Margaret tried to justify.

"Let's eat," Liam interrupted, ending the discussion without pressuring Olivia.

He led the way to the dining room, expression stern, with Olivia close behind.

"Yes, let's eat," Richard chimed in, ushering Catherine to assist Margaret as they all moved toward dinner.

Left behind, Evelyn stood frozen, nails digging into her palms as she watched them leave.

The meal passed in tense silence. By afternoon, guests began arriving. Despite her anger, Margaret plastered on a smile, greeting each visitor cheerfully in the parlor.

Yet whenever Olivia appeared nearby, Margaret's smile faltered, eyes flashing with suppressed rage. So many guests had come specifically for Olivia!

When birthday RSVPs poured in days earlier, Margaret assumed they came for her, Liam, or Richard. To her shock, several had come solely for Olivia.

"Mr. Bradford! What an honor! You rarely return from overseas!" Richard warmly welcomed the prominent international client, prompting Margaret to rush over.

Nathaniel Bradford presented a gift but ignored Margaret, heading straight to Olivia instead.

With his sign language interpreter, Nathaniel beamed at Olivia. "Olivia, who knew Gregory's studio housed such talent? I've wanted your expertise on antique restoration but never found the right opportunity. When I heard you'd be here, I made sure to return. Might you assist me?"

Olivia responded with a shy smile, eagerly nodding agreement.

"Nathaniel came for Olivia?" Margaret whispered to Catherine, voice tight with disbelief. Another guest for Olivia! It was unbearable. She longed to banish Olivia immediately!

###Chapter 88

"Margaret, darling, don't let this upset you. Tonight is your night—"

Catherine forced a smile, trying to soothe Margaret's rising temper.

"That woman was supposed to be invisible! Now she's stealing my spotlight!" Margaret's face twisted with barely contained rage, her manicured nails digging into her champagne flute.

"Let me handle this." Evelyn materialized beside them, her cat-like eyes glinting with mischief.

"Evelyn, you have a plan?" Margaret's expression brightened instantly.

"It'll require your cooperation." Evelyn's lips curved into a sly smile before she melted into the crowd.

Moments later, she discreetly signaled Vincent Holloway toward Liam.

"Mr. Blackwood, might I discuss the Royal Arch project with you?"

Vincent approached Liam, who stood protectively beside Olivia. Liam swirled his champagne absently, his posture deceptively relaxed.

When business was mentioned, Liam politely declined. "Tonight is my mother's celebration. Let's keep this social."

"Mr. Blackwood, when are you ever not working?" Vincent feigned surprise. "This concerns the Royal Arch project. Surely you're interested?"

Liam's grip tightened imperceptibly on his glass. "Mr. Holloway, you're aware of Blackwood Enterprises' stake in this."

"Precisely why I'm puzzled by your setbacks." Vincent's smile turned conspiratorial as he glanced meaningfully at Olivia. "Governor Sinclair has... particular preferences regarding business partners' marital situations."

Liam's brow furrowed. "The governor plays favorites? This is news to me."

"New administration, new rules." Vincent shrugged. "Frankly, he asked me to enlighten you."

"And your suggestion?" Liam's voice turned dangerously calm.

"A simple public gesture would suffice." Vincent leaned closer. "Show some distance from your wife. Perhaps demonstrate... preference toward Miss Hartley?"

Vincent stepped back, smug. "Billions at stake, Mr. Blackwood. Surely a small performance is worth it?"

Liam's gaze turned glacial. "How do I know this isn't a trap?"

Vincent chuckled nervously. "If the governor still denies you after this, you have my permission to ruin me. I wouldn't dare cross you."

Across the room, Evelyn felt Liam's gaze and turned deliberately, linking arms with Margaret just as Julian Martinez approached.

"Liam, darling," Margaret simpered, "would you introduce me to Mr. Martinez?"

Julian turned expectantly. Trapped by social decorum, Liam approached, allowing Evelyn to cling to his arm while Margaret preened—the picture of a perfect family.

Olivia watched from the shadows, her chest tightening. She'd been paraded here like a trophy, forced to endure Margaret's half-hearted apology, subjected to Liam's performative affection. It was more than she'd ever received from his family, yet it still stung.

She turned toward the exit, her heels silent on the marble. Before, watching Liam with Evelyn would have shattered her. Now, she just felt... numb.

"Olivia."

Liam's voice stopped her mid-step. He'd broken away from Evelyn's grasp and was striding toward her.

"Mr. Blackwood, you—" Vincent interjected loudly, "This isn't enough! You must show estrangement! Ignore her completely!"

The words hung in the air, reaching Olivia's ears with cruel clarity. People always assumed her silence meant deafness. They were wrong. She'd heard every whispered word, understood the stakes. She wouldn't be the reason Liam lost this deal.

She turned to leave—only for a strong hand to encircle her wrist.
###Chapter 89

Liam was the one who grabbed Olivia's wrist. His dark eyes burned with displeasure as he glared at her, clearly irritated by her attempt to leave the gathering.

"Where do you think you're going?" Liam demanded in a low, controlled voice. "You're staying with me."

Olivia met his gaze, confusion flickering across her delicate features. She had attended countless events with Liam before, yet always felt like an outsider. Whether she stayed glued to his side or slipped away early, his disapproval was inevitable.

Eventually, Olivia stopped accompanying Liam altogether, and Evelyn had taken her place.

Now, facing Liam's familiar scowl, Olivia braced for another lecture about proper social etiquette.

But to her astonishment, Liam simply pulled her back to his side without comment and guided her toward Julian to continue their discussion.

Vincent, witnessing the exchange, shifted uncomfortably before shooting Evelyn a meaningful look and discreetly withdrawing.

"Mr. Blackwood, you and your wife make such a striking pair," Julian remarked with a charming smile, drawing Liam into conversation as other guests gathered around.

Throughout the evening, Liam's grip on Olivia's hand remained unyielding, his fingers interlaced with hers until the last guest departed.

As the mansion fell silent, Richard pulled Liam aside for a private word, leaving Olivia waiting near the grand staircase.

It was then that Margaret approached.

Margaret's critical gaze swept over Olivia from head to toe, her lips curling in disdain. "You didn't lift a finger all evening, and now you can't be bothered to help clean up?" she sneered, her voice dripping with contempt.

Olivia faced her mother-in-law with calm detachment, offering no response.

"First mute, now deaf too?" Margaret muttered under her breath as she reached to grab Olivia's arm.

Margaret's bony fingers always sought out the tenderest spots on Olivia's arms, leaving behind bruises that took weeks to fade.

In the past, Olivia had endured the abuse silently, only occasionally flinching when Margaret came too close. Tonight should have been no different.

"Do you really think Liam would choose you over his own mother?" Margaret hissed venomously. "You'd better behave unless you want to find yourself divorced!"

As Margaret reached to pinch Olivia again, Olivia suddenly twisted free from her grasp.

The movement was swift and decisive, accompanied by an audible snap as their connection broke.

Margaret froze, shock etching deep lines into her face as she gaped at Olivia's unexpected defiance.

Olivia pulled out her phone and typed rapidly: "Ask Evelyn if she needs help cleaning. I won't be doing it."

She showed the message to Margaret before turning on her heel and striding away, leaving her mother-in-law speechless.

"You ungrateful—" Margaret reached out to stop her, but Olivia easily shook off her grasp.

Margaret had always bullied Olivia because she rarely fought back. Despite Olivia's slender frame, she was decades younger than Margaret, and the older woman couldn't actually harm her without risking exposure.

As Olivia shrugged her off again, Margaret nearly stumbled from the force, but Olivia didn't even glance back.

"You'll regret this!" Margaret barely contained her scream, not wanting to draw Liam's attention. She glared at Olivia's retreating figure, her fingers curling into claws. "Just you wait!"

Heading toward the parking lot, Olivia was startled by a voice calling her name. Nathaniel stood near the mansion's front gates, the sign language interpreter beside him.

Olivia's face lit up with surprise as she signed a greeting.

Nathaniel smiled warmly, his aristocratic features softening. "I was waiting for you, Olivia. As I mentioned earlier, there's something I'd like to discuss."

During the party, Nathaniel had briefly mentioned needing Olivia's expertise for an antique restoration project, but they'd been interrupted before he could explain fully.

Seeing him waiting, Olivia signed eagerly, asking about the artifact and expressing her enthusiasm for the restoration work.

Olivia was always willing to help within their social circle. Whether artifacts went to Gregory's studio or Whitmore Holdings' Antiquities Department, she was happy to contribute personally. It was excellent professional experience and might even benefit Liam's business connections—

Olivia caught herself mid-thought. Why was she still considering Liam's interests when she was contemplating divorce?

"You're always so generous with your time! Don't worry, compensation won't be an issue. Actually, there's another dimension to this project—" Nathaniel began, but was abruptly interrupted by a cold, commanding voice.

"If you want my wife to take on a project, you should start with a proper proposal, don't you think?" Liam's voice cut through the night as he approached, his steely gaze fixed on Nathaniel with unmistakable possessiveness.
###Chapter 90

"Mr. Blackwood, you're absolutely correct. I should show my sincerity," Nathaniel said, motioning to his sign language interpreter to fetch the gift from his car.

But Olivia didn't want this. She wasn't the calculating type who obsessed over every penny. Though she understood corporate culture, she wasn't purely a businesswoman. She was nothing like Liam, who put profits above everything.

Olivia quickly gestured to Nathaniel that gifts were unnecessary, conveying she'd gladly help if needed.

The interpreter had already left, and Nathaniel missed Olivia's signals.

Liam caught on immediately.

As Olivia reached for her phone to clarify, Liam stepped closer. "How generous of you," he remarked, eyeing her with undisguised skepticism.

Olivia met his gaze defiantly - she refused to become someone like him.

Moving aside, Olivia typed a message and showed it to Liam. "What's this about?"

"Olivia, you're too kind!" Nathaniel exclaimed, his face lighting up. "Actually, it's for Westfield University's anniversary event. I was hoping you'd give a presentation."

Nathaniel had originally planned a speech, but Olivia's condition made a presentation more suitable.

"It's the Archaeology Department's 50th anniversary, coinciding with Westfield's 80th. As an alumnus, I felt compelled to participate," Nathaniel explained in detail.

Olivia nodded understandingly. Westfield University was nationally renowned, and Nathaniel's invitation was indeed an honor.

"We're inviting several distinguished alumni to share insights. I'd love you to be one of them. Would that work?" Nathaniel asked.

Olivia considered it might just be a panel discussion. Even if she attended, she imagined playing a minor role, especially with experts like Gregory likely present.

Yet Nathaniel's hopeful expression made Olivia agree without hesitation. She nodded her acceptance.

"Thank you, Olivia!" Nathaniel said gratefully, visibly relieved.

Liam scoffed, "Do you even know what this event involves? And you're agreeing so easily?"

Though uncertain what awaited, Olivia felt excited about new experiences. She was open to adventures she'd never tried before.

Liam had questioned her repeatedly. Ignoring him again might make him lose face. So Olivia turned to Liam, gesturing that she simply wanted new experiences and wouldn't embarrass him.

She felt confident. Despite the interrogation, she'd maintained her composure each time.

Liam looked displeased but stayed silent.

When Nathaniel's interpreter returned with the gift, Olivia politely declined, expressing appreciation but suggesting they wait until after her presentation. Accepting it now felt inappropriate.

Unable to insist, Nathaniel simply smiled gratefully.

Liam remained sullenly quiet until they left the Blackwood estate and were alone in the car.

Pulling over, Liam turned to Olivia with intense seriousness. "What's your real game here?"

Olivia met his gaze steadily. Since resolving her inner conflicts, Liam's attempts to unsettle her had lost their power.

"Must you be so friendly with everyone?" Liam pressed.

Olivia signed calmly that if being helpful improved people's view of Blackwood Enterprises, she was willing.

"You're considering my career in this?" Liam raised an eyebrow.

Olivia countered, "Isn't that what partners do? Support each other?"

"I've told you before - you don't need to work or stress about these things," Liam sighed.

Sorrow flickered in Olivia's eyes as she signed, "So I'm worthless then?"

She continued firmly, "Am I less important than your career? You can pretend to dislike me for a project, and I should accept that?"

Earlier, Olivia had absorbed Vincent's words, now voicing her displeasure directly.

"What nonsense are you spouting?" Liam's face twisted in scornful irritation. "Listen - you're more important than my career! More than my job! Have I ever embarrassed you for a project? Never!"

Olivia blinked, emotion washing over her. Could she truly mean more to Liam than his work?

Her thoughts shattered as Liam's phone rang. Evelyn was calling.

"What is it?" Liam answered, his voice filling the silent car. Evelyn's sweet, enticing tones followed.

Liam's voice softened noticeably - an involuntary reaction. Despite his affectionate words to Olivia, his actions spoke volumes. Deep down, Evelyn still held his heart.
###Chapter 91

Olivia watched Liam's furrowed brow as he spoke softly into his phone. Without waiting, she slipped out of the passenger seat unnoticed.

"Liam, today was absolutely terrible," Evelyn's pitiful voice crackled through the receiver.

She'd spent the entire day trying to impress Margaret by running errands, only for Olivia to steal all the praise at the banquet.

Suppressing her rage, Evelyn played the victim to gain Liam's sympathy.

Liam murmured comforting words before hanging up. When he stepped out, Olivia was gone.

His phone buzzed with a fifteen-minute-old message: "Took a cab to William's apartment."

No goodnight. No explanation. Liam's fist slammed against the car window, his jaw tightening.

Meanwhile, Olivia entered her new luxury apartment for the first time. The automatic lights revealed a pristine space - William had thought of everything.

Top-tier security ensured no delivery personnel could enter without screening. The fridge was stocked, the furniture brand new.

Tears welled in Olivia's eyes as childhood memories flooded back.

Henry had doted on her with unmatched care. Yet she'd stubbornly married Liam, throwing herself into misery.

Collapsing onto the couch, she acknowledged her slow but steady transformation.

Her phone's sudden ring startled her.

Natalie rarely called since Olivia couldn't speak. Worried, she answered immediately.

"Olivia! Tap our code if you're safe!" Natalie's urgent voice demanded.

Three quick taps - three-three-four - the emergency signal they'd established years ago.

"Thank God! Switching to text," Natalie said before hanging up.

A voice message followed: "I'm SO sorry! My family dragged me into this nightmare project and I completely forgot about Margaret's birthday! Did that witch give you trouble again?"

Olivia had never shared the full extent of Margaret's cruelty over the years.

Last year, Natalie had noticed Olivia's bruises and vowed to protect her. Now she'd forgotten her promise.

Olivia texted: "Actually, I refused to help with preparations this year."

She described how she'd attended as Liam's date and countered Margaret's schemes.

"Incredible! Where are you now? Is Liam bothering you?" Natalie pressed.

"At William's gift. Come see?" Olivia sent the address, explaining the luxury apartment.

"On my way with snacks! You're spilling EVERYTHING!"

When Natalie arrived, arms laden with food, she pulled Olivia into a crushing hug. "You look amazing! Unlike me - my father's been torturing me with this impossible project!"

She dramatically flopped onto the couch. "Why me when Daniel exists? He's threatening to cut my allowance if I don't deliver!"

Olivia gestured that perhaps her father wanted her to take over the business.

"Over my dead body!" Natalie groaned. "I need a month-long spa retreat after this!"

After venting, she turned serious. "Now tell me everything."

Olivia shared her recent encounters with both families, prompting Natalie to curse Margaret violently.

Olivia soothed her friend - she'd moved past needing revenge.

Then she hesitated before gesturing an important question: Could Natalie accompany her to prenatal appointments? The pregnancy remained their secret.

###Chapter 92

"Of course! Who else would accompany you to your prenatal appointment? Should we let that scoundrel Liam near you?" Natalie declared passionately before launching into a tirade about Liam's failings as a father.

Olivia responded with a serene smile, silently conveying they should focus on their happiness rather than past grievances.

"You're absolutely right," Natalie agreed with an emphatic nod.

They spent the evening chatting over midnight snacks before Natalie stayed over. At dawn, they set out for Mercy Hospital together.

Natalie initially proposed inviting Daniel along, but Olivia declined. She wanted to keep this private, concerned about potential misunderstandings if Daniel attended the prenatal visit.

Choosing the Whitmore family's hospital where she'd first discovered her pregnancy, Olivia hoped to minimize any chance of Liam learning about her medical visit.

"Your test results show improvement in the anemia and malnutrition, but levels still aren't normal. Continued imbalance could affect fetal development," the physician explained while reviewing Olivia's charts, detailing each concerning marker before prescribing specialized supplements.

"These must be taken precisely as directed. You'll need more frequent monitoring than typical expectant mothers, even after stabilization," the doctor emphasized.

"Understood," Natalie answered for Olivia, her brow furrowed with concern. "We'll follow every instruction meticulously."

"Good. Are you family?" The doctor glanced at Natalie. "Where's the father?"

Olivia froze at the unexpected question. Before she could respond, Natalie snapped, "Dead!"

"Oh... My condolences," the doctor stammered, taken aback.

"Save your sympathy. He died in another woman's bed!" Natalie clenched her jaw and gestured toward Olivia. "His betrayal caused her condition. That bastard broke her heart!"

"I... see." The physician clearly hadn't anticipated such drama from a routine question. After offering additional care instructions, he quickly dismissed them.

"Don't overexert yourself," Natalie cautioned as they exited the hospital.

Olivia shook her head - work brought her solace.

"Then work remotely! William thought of everything - your apartment has a full restoration studio now. No need to visit the office!" Natalie insisted. "But promise you'll rest when needed!"

Olivia nodded with a grateful smile.

Truthfully, losing herself in restoration work helped Olivia escape emotional pain - a coping mechanism Natalie might not fully understand, so Olivia kept silent about it.

"At least there are no dietary restrictions, so—" Natalie's sentence cut off abruptly.

They'd just exited obstetrics when Evelyn and Liam appeared from the opposite corridor.

Olivia's pulse spiked. Had Liam discovered her pregnancy? How would she handle this confrontation?

"What are you doing here?" Evelyn sneered before Liam could speak, her gaze raking over Olivia with contempt.

"Little mute, did you catch something disgusting? Is that why you're seeing a gynecologist?" Evelyn's voice dripped with malice.

Natalie fired back instantly. "Shut your filthy mouth! Gynecologists don't treat infections! But you two came from dermatology - getting STD treatment? Projecting much? Did you infect Liam too? Is that why you're both here? Liam, stay away from Olivia with your contagious diseases!"

Natalie's outburst turned Evelyn crimson with rage. "Don't slander me!" she shrieked.

"Slander? I didn't accuse you of slandering Olivia earlier, so why is it slander when it's about you?" Natalie countered fiercely.

Eyes blazing, Evelyn looked ready to strike.

Liam finally intervened. "Enough!"

Then, surprisingly, he explained to Olivia, "We're visiting a mutual friend recovering from burn injuries."

Olivia nodded slowly, taken aback by his unprompted clarification.

"And you?" Liam's gaze dropped to the medical forms peeking from Olivia's bag. He stepped closer, hand outstretched. "What were you tested for? Show me."

Olivia's heartbeat thundered as she clutched the bag behind her. Those papers would reveal everything.

Her evasion only heightened Liam's suspicion. His eyes narrowed dangerously. "What are you hiding from me?"
###Chapter 93

"Mr. Blackwood, isn't this crossing professional boundaries?" Natalie stepped protectively in front of Olivia, confronting Liam directly.

Olivia's pulse quickened, her heartbeat thundering in her ears.

"What do you think you're doing?" Liam's voice cut through the air like a whip as he glared at Natalie. "Step aside!"

His hand shot out toward Olivia's bag, fingers grasping for her medical records.

The moment Liam touched the documents, Natalie raised her voice dramatically. "Why are you so obsessed with my private gynecological reports? Have you completely lost your senses, Liam?"

Liam froze mid-motion. Natalie seized the opportunity to widen the distance between him and Olivia.

This time, Liam didn't pursue them.

"What did you just say?" His dark brows drew together as he fixed Natalie with an intense stare.

"I said those are my medical files in Olivia's bag." Natalie enunciated each word clearly, drawing curious glances from nearby hospital staff. "I've been having irregular cycles, so I asked Olivia to accompany me to my OB-GYN appointment!"

She squared her shoulders defiantly. "What's your sudden interest in my reproductive health, Mr. Blackwood? Developing an unhealthy obsession with me? Should I read my pelvic exam results aloud for you?"

Natalie's audacious claim effectively shut down any further questioning.

Behind her protective stance, Olivia released the breath she'd been holding.

"I assumed Olivia was ill." Liam's expression remained unreadable, though his voice carried an edge.

"Can't I ask my best friend for support when I'm unwell?" Natalie countered sharply.

"She can't even speak. What kind of support is that?" Evelyn's mocking voice carried across the hallway.

Olivia's shoulders hunched instinctively under Evelyn's barb. Then, remembering the life growing inside her, she straightened and met Evelyn's gaze head-on.

With deliberate movements, Olivia began signing her response.

While Evelyn looked bewildered, Liam's frown deepened as he deciphered Olivia's gestures.

Natalie translated aloud. "Olivia may have lost her voice, but she was your wife first."

She couldn't resist adding, "If you're so special, why are you still just the mistress, looking so pleased with your second-rate position?"

"You—!" Evelyn's face flushed crimson, her chest heaving as she shot Liam an imploring glance.

But Liam's attention remained fixed on Olivia, his dark gaze burning with unreadable intensity.

"Let's go," Natalie muttered, pulling Olivia away before Liam could notice anything suspicious about her friend's condition.

Miraculously, Liam didn't follow.

Even as they walked away, Olivia could feel the weight of his stare. Only when safely inside Natalie's car did she realize her blouse clung to her back with cold sweat.

Deceiving Liam and standing up to him were things Olivia never imagined herself capable of. Yet here she was, doing both repeatedly. Though fear still gripped her physically, the emotional chains had loosened.

Why should she continue obeying Liam's every whim?

"You alright?" Natalie's concerned voice pulled Olivia from her thoughts.

Olivia nodded silently.

"About that divorce you mentioned..." Natalie hesitated. "Any progress? Need help finding a lawyer? Is he still demanding that ridiculous sum?"

Olivia confirmed she'd gathered the twenty million and raised the divorce again, but Liam continued stalling.

"That bastard!" Natalie's grip tightened on the steering wheel. "Why's he stringing you along? He's practically glued to Evelyn's side but won't let you move on?"

A bitter smile touched Olivia's lips as she signed that this was typical Liam behavior.

"True." Natalie sighed. "He's been cheating since your wedding day. Why expect anything different now?"

"I've got an idea!" Natalie suddenly grabbed Olivia's arm, eyes lighting up.

Olivia tilted her head in question.

"You need to shake him up properly. I read about this woman whose abusive husband refused to grant a divorce," Natalie explained excitedly.

Olivia listened intently, assuming Natalie had conceived some brilliant legal strategy.

"The woman? She poured boiling water on her husband while he slept. Scared him so badly he signed the papers immediately, terrified she might actually kill him next time!"

Olivia's eyes widened in horror.

But Natalie looked thrilled. "Isn't it perfect? Imagine standing over Liam's bed with a knife! If you frighten him enough, he'll sign anything! Men like him value their lives above all else."

Olivia shook her head vehemently.

"Why not?" Natalie pressed. "Don't tell me you still have feelings for him?"

Olivia signed that such extreme measures weren't in her nature. Besides, she added, Liam would probably have her committed if she tried anything like that.

"Fair point..." Natalie conceded reluctantly. "Liam isn't like other men..."

"But!" Natalie turned the key in the ignition. "What if he discovers the pregnancy? Olivia, have you thought about what you'll do then?"

Olivia shook her head. She hadn't formulated a plan yet, only hoping that day would never come.

For now, she needed Natalie's help with something else. She gestured urgently, asking for a favor.
###Chapter 94

"What's going on? Just say it! You know you don't need to stand on ceremony with me!" Natalie pressed urgently.

Olivia revealed that Nathaniel had invited her to speak at Westfield University. She then mentioned knowing Natalie's brother Daniel had graduated from there and wondered if he'd heard anything about the upcoming event.

Since she couldn't verbally communicate, Olivia expressed concern through gestures that something might go wrong during her participation in the panel discussion.

Before Olivia could fully explain her worries, Natalie immediately understood and grasped her hand reassuringly.

"Don't stress about it. I've got your back. Westfield's anniversary is familiar territory for me. Daniel and I can both attend with you," Natalie promised, her confident tone easing Olivia's nerves.

For reasons she couldn't quite pinpoint, Olivia had been plagued by unease about this event, a nagging fear that disaster loomed.

Tragically, Olivia's premonitions proved accurate when shocking news greeted her the following morning.

Waking before her usual time, Olivia checked her phone while still wrapped in blankets. Scrolling through news alerts, her own name jumped out at her.

An attention-seeking influencer had leaked the guest list for Westfield University's anniversary, specifically highlighting Olivia's name and emphasizing her speech impairment.

The inflammatory caption read: "A mute giving a lecture? Has Westfield University lost its mind?"

Though Olivia had braced for criticism, the speed and cruelty of the online attack still shocked her.

The comment section showed genuine confusion from most readers. Westfield University maintained rigorous standards and had never invited unqualified speakers before.

Even a famous actress had been rejected for a lecture spot after character flaws surfaced, despite her massive popularity.

Therefore, few questioned Westfield's judgment in selecting Olivia. Most assumed the blogger was simply stirring controversy for clicks.

But soon, a flood of suspicious accounts drowned out the reasonable comments.

These trolls viciously attacked Olivia, claiming she'd only achieved success through her husband and family connections. They accused her of using Liam for fame and secretly leveraging the Blackwood name. Far from the understanding wife aware of Liam's affairs, they painted Olivia as a cunning manipulator whose public image was just an act.

After his morning executive meeting, Liam learned about the situation from his team. "Why wasn't this handled immediately?" he demanded, his expression darkening as he grasped the severity of the smear campaign.

"It's complicated, sir," the PR director explained awkwardly. "Before we could act, another party had already addressed the situation."

"Who?" Liam snapped.

"The Whitmore Holdings group," the PR director admitted, lowering his head. "They moved faster than we did."

Liam's silence filled the room with palpable tension.

The PR director kept his gaze down. He'd followed company protocol precisely. Who could have predicted Whitmore Holdings' lightning-fast response?

During her commute to work, Olivia's forehead creased with worry. She had a scheduled session at Gregory's studio today and feared how the online storm might affect her colleagues.

While Gregory's fearlessness was legendary in their circle, internet trolls didn't know that.

The thought of Gregory facing backlash because of her filled Olivia with guilt.

Upon arriving at the studio, however, Olivia was relieved to find the malicious posts had vanished. Whoever had erased the damaging content so thoroughly must wield serious influence. She wondered if Nathaniel was responsible.

Olivia resolved to apologize to Gregory immediately - this mess had started because of her after all.

As Olivia entered, Marcus and several concerned coworkers immediately approached. "Olivia, are you okay?"

"We all saw what happened online, but don't let it get to you."

"Clearly someone's trying to sabotage you, which just proves how talented you are. Only petty, jealous people would stoop so low. Keep your head up!"

Marcus had a knack for delivering perfect comforting words.

Though touched, Olivia still felt compelled to apologize for the studio's reputation being dragged into the mess.

"Why are you apologizing? You didn't spread those lies!" Marcus raised an eyebrow, genuinely puzzled by Olivia's remorse.

Blushing, Olivia explained through gestures that by targeting her, the attackers had indirectly gone after Gregory too.

"Olivia, maybe you should consider talking to a professional," Marcus said seriously. "You always blame yourself for everything, and that's not healthy, you know?"

Olivia froze, struck by realization. Throughout her marriage, she'd believed Liam's unhappiness was her fault. But Marcus' words sparked new clarity. Maybe she wasn't as responsible as she'd always thought.

"Olivia, you've got a visitor," a voice called from the doorway as Olivia processed this revelation.

Turning, Olivia saw Nathaniel enter the studio.

"I owe you an apology, Olivia," Nathaniel said remorsefully. "I mishandled things, and you got dragged through the mud just for accepting Westfield's invitation."

Marcus quipped teasingly, "Ah, another guilt-ridden soul."

Olivia approached Nathaniel with a reassuring smile, gesturing her appreciation for how quickly he'd contained the situation after the blogger's attack.

"What?" Nathaniel looked genuinely confused. "But I didn't handle it. I thought your studio took care of everything!"

Olivia's eyes widened in surprise - if not Nathaniel, then who? Resolving the crisis so swiftly required serious influence. Could Liam have been involved?

###Chapter 95

Memories of Liam's handsome face and commanding presence flooded Olivia's mind, making her pulse quicken. A soft smile tugged at her lips as she recalled their last encounter.

Turning to Nathaniel, Olivia assured him she'd prepared herself for the inevitable skepticism and judgment, emphasizing how little such baseless accusations affected her now. She reminded him those issues had already been resolved, making further concern unnecessary.

Nathaniel exhaled in relief as he studied Olivia's serene expression bathed in afternoon light, feeling an unexpected pang of sympathy. Even someone as extraordinary as Olivia wasn't perfect - her damaged vocal cords remained a cruel limitation.

After parting ways with Nathaniel, restless energy coursed through Olivia. She approached Marcus, explaining she needed to run an important errand that afternoon.

Marcus arched an eyebrow knowingly. "Going to see your husband, aren't you? Why the hesitation? You're married - this should be perfectly normal."

Olivia shook her head solemnly. Things had changed between them. Their marriage stood on the brink of collapse.

During breaks from her restoration work, Olivia had sculpted a small piece - a delicate songbird soaring through wispy clouds, symbolizing resilience and freedom.

Gregory had once expressed interest in acquiring this very piece.

At the time, Olivia dismissed it as merely an experimental work, unworthy of collection. She'd promised Gregory she'd create something more refined if inspiration struck again.

Though imperfect and lacking professional polish, Olivia now believed it carried genuine sentiment - a fitting token of gratitude.

After having it carefully wrapped at a boutique, Olivia headed for Blackwood Enterprises.

Her previous dramatic visit ensured no one dared interfere this time.

The receptionist escorted Olivia to the executive elevator, whisking her to the top floor.

As they arrived, they nearly collided with Sebastian rushing down the corridor. Spotting Olivia, his expression froze momentarily.

"Mrs. Blackwood—" Sebastian caught himself, noticing nearby staff. "Miss Sinclair. What brings you here today?"

Olivia retrieved her phone and typed: Is Liam available?

Sebastian cleared his throat. "He's in, but currently occupied. Perhaps you could wait in the lounge?"

Olivia declined with a shake of her head. She only wanted to deliver her gift of appreciation. If he was too busy, she'd simply leave it with a note.

After a brief hesitation, Sebastian stepped aside, gesturing toward Liam's office.

The door stood slightly ajar.

Voices filtered through the gap - Liam wasn't alone.

Olivia's hand hovered over the handle when distinctive feminine laughter froze her in place. Her heartbeat stuttered, but she maintained outward composure.

Just as Olivia raised her hand to knock, Evelyn's voice carried clearly: "Liam, why bother with that mute wife of yours? She's nothing but trouble. Always causing scenes. If I were her, I'd hide at home to spare you the embarrassment."

Olivia's breath caught. She strained to hear Liam's response.

His low chuckle sent ice through her veins. "True, she's exhausting. Not nearly as understanding as you."

Olivia's heart constricted painfully. Though she'd anticipated this reaction, hearing the words from Liam's lips shattered her. To him, she was merely an inconvenient burden. The cruelest part? Her inability to even voice her pain.

Evelyn's triumphant laughter rang out, grating against Olivia's raw nerves.

Grimacing, Olivia set down her carefully wrapped gift by the door and turned away.

Inside the descending elevator, bitterness coated Olivia's tongue. She'd foolishly imagined suggesting they attend Westfield University's anniversary together - a selfish fantasy where she could prove her independence to Liam. Now, the idea seemed laughable.

Regaining composure, Olivia texted Isabella: I've got free time tonight. Interested in visiting Westfield University?

Unaware of Olivia's presence, Liam watched Evelyn's advances with icy detachment.

He stepped back, his entire posture radiating rejection. "Was this your entire purpose for coming? Are you satisfied now? Please leave."

Evelyn's face darkened. "What do you mean, Liam? You didn't mean what you said? I was just speaking the truth everyone knows - Olivia's a nuisance."

Liam's gaze turned glacial as he gestured toward the door. "Get out. I have actual work to do."

Pouting, Evelyn flounced toward the exit. Outside Liam's office, her stiletto caught on something. Already irritated, she roughly handled the delicate package.

"More useless clutter," she muttered.

Then she froze, recognizing the handwriting on the attached note.

Crouching, Evelyn extracted the sculpture, her eyes gleaming with sudden interest.

Meanwhile, Liam called Sebastian. "Clear my schedule for Westfield University's anniversary."

"Westfield—" Sebastian hesitated. "Is this about your wife?"

Liam's voice turned sharp. "Just make the arrangements."

Despite disapproving of Olivia's public appearances, Liam had tried mitigating the backlash against her - always a step too late.

Lately, Olivia had become increasingly defensive, prickly as a threatened hedgehog.

Abandoning his work, Liam headed not home, but to Olivia's new residence. After several unanswered rings, frustration creased his brow.

He abandoned the doorbell for sharp raps on the wood, growing more insistent.

"Olivia!" His knocks became pounding, his hands aching, yet only silence answered.

Pulling out his phone, Liam debated calling authorities or a locksmith.

A security guard approached cautiously. "Sir, the resident is traveling and won't return for days. You can leave your information—"

Liam's eyes darkened. "She just left, didn't she?"

At the guard's nod, Liam stormed out. His phone rang - Evelyn. He answered abruptly. "You wanted a getaway? I'm free. Pick somewhere."

Stunned, Evelyn recovered quickly. "My choice then. It'll be a surprise."

###Chapter 96

The trip was supposed to be just Olivia and Isabella's getaway, but when Natalie caught wind of their plans, she insisted on tagging along.

Natalie volunteered to arrive first to handle hotel arrangements and meet them at the airport.

Yet when they landed, it was Daniel who stood waiting at arrivals.

Olivia blinked in surprise, quickly signing to ask why he was there when she knew he'd been swamped with work.

Daniel flashed his signature charming grin. "True, I've been drowning in paperwork lately. But everyone needs a break, right? Might as well make it a group vacation. Natalie found this incredible place and is waiting for us there."

Seeing his enthusiasm, Olivia didn't protest. She and Isabella climbed into Daniel's waiting car.

Only when they arrived did they understand Natalie's idea of "fun."

Their destination turned out to be a museum adjacent to Westfield University, famous for its collection of artifacts from nearby ancient burial grounds. The exhibits featured jewelry and ornaments dating back millennia.

Reading the museum's introduction plaque, Olivia's eyes sparkled with excitement. She turned to Isabella, hands flying as she expressed her delight through animated signing.

Though voiceless, Olivia's entire body radiated joy.

Isabella watched her with affectionate warmth. "You're absolutely loving this, aren't you? Let's grab some souvenirs before we leave. Maybe they'll inspire your restoration work." Olivia nodded eagerly.

Spotting them from across the hall, Natalie came barreling over and swept Olivia into an enthusiastic embrace.

Used to Natalie's boundless energy, Olivia returned the hug with a bright smile.

Natalie gestured proudly around them. "So? Isn't this place amazing? No photos allowed, but there's so much to see. They've got interactive exhibits too - we should definitely try them!"

The group exchanged lighthearted banter as they explored deeper into the museum.

They soon discovered a cultural experience zone.

The museum had set up a special area for traditional lantern displays.

Staff in period costumes engaged visitors with riddles. Winners received exquisitely crafted rabbit lanterns.

While not ancient artifacts, these lanterns were made using historical techniques documented throughout the museum.

Olivia's breath caught at the sight. She longed to take one home as reference material.

An opportunity arose, but participation required mixed-gender pairs.

Eyes shining, Olivia grabbed Natalie's hand excitedly.

Natalie sighed dramatically. "Fine, I'll team up with my brother, but don't get your hopes up. Riddles aren't exactly my forte."

Daniel offered an encouraging smile. "Just do your best. Since Olivia's so interested, I'll give it my all."

Natalie rolled her eyes playfully. "If it was something I wanted, you'd probably make me solve it alone. Some brother you are."

Unaware of their teasing, Olivia thanked Daniel with a grateful gesture.

Ten minutes later, Natalie returned looking crestfallen. She pouted at Olivia. "Sweetie, I really tried."

Isabella added with resignation, "I'm terrible at these things too. I wouldn't be much help."

Watching Daniel still struggling through the crowd, Olivia's guilt intensified. Setting her jaw, she decided to try herself.

Natalie had given her best effort, but the final riddle proved too difficult.

Olivia and Daniel teamed up on the spot, tackling each puzzle together.

Though Olivia couldn't speak, her mind worked quickly.

Once she solved a riddle, she signaled to Daniel.

He understood her signs perfectly.

They reached the final question.

Olivia's expression turned serious as she studied it. "Sitting to the south, facing the north, it looks sad when you do, and happy when you do."

She glanced at Daniel questioningly.

He shook his head, equally perplexed.

Olivia mouthed the riddle to herself, searching for meaning. Then it hit her - a mirror!

Excited, she raised her hand to signal Daniel.

"It's a mirror," a cool, familiar voice declared from behind.

Olivia spun around to see Liam and Evelyn approaching. Their striking presence drew every eye in the room.

Shock and bitterness twisted in Olivia's chest. Liam's appearance stunned her, and Evelyn clinging to his arm seemed to explain everything.

Without glancing at Olivia, Liam addressed a staff member. "Is my answer correct?"

The attendant beamed. "Congratulations, sir! You've solved it!"

Evelyn squeezed Liam's arm, simpering. "Liam, you're amazing! I never thought you'd play along with these silly games."

Liam gave her a brief look. "You wanted that lantern, didn't you? Go claim your prize," he said, his tone flat but indulgent toward Evelyn.

Olivia's heart sank further. She lowered her gaze, unwilling to meet Liam's eyes.

"Wait a moment." Daniel stepped forward, blocking Evelyn's path to the lantern. "The rules state answers must be given in turn. We raised our hands first. My friend had already solved it - she just couldn't verbalize the answer quickly. Why does that mean you win?"

Evelyn crossed her arms defiantly. "Prove she knew the answer first."

Olivia pulled out her phone and typed rapidly. The clue was in the first line - 'looks sad when you are, looks happy when you are.' I'd already figured it out. I can explain my reasoning.

As Olivia explained, she felt Liam's icy stare. No doubt he resented her interfering with Evelyn's moment.

But Olivia refused to back down. She rarely stood up for herself, but that didn't make her a pushover.

"Well..." The staff member looked increasingly uncomfortable.

Suddenly Evelyn burst into shrill laughter, covering her mouth mockingly. "Honestly, I thought the rule was male-female pairs. Can someone who can't even speak participate? Seems like the man does all the work while she takes credit. How is that fair? A mute solving riddles? That's just ridiculous."
###Chapter 97

Whispers rippled through the gathered crowd like a sudden breeze.

Olivia felt the sharp sting of sarcasm cutting through her, her fingers curling into tight fists at her sides.

Then, a voice of reason cut through the tension. "Enough. We shouldn't judge someone by their disabilities. She hasn't done anything wrong. You're being unfair."

Evelyn's face twisted in barely contained rage, her jaw clenched so tight it might crack. "Olivia was the one who bid. Let her answer for herself. I want to hear it from her lips."

Each word struck Olivia like a physical blow.

"Enough!" Daniel's temper flared, his body tensing as he moved toward Evelyn.

Olivia reacted instantly, her hand shooting out to grasp Daniel's wrist. In her urgency, she didn't realize how intimate the gesture appeared.

Her eyes wide with silent pleading, Olivia shook her head at Daniel.

She knew if Daniel provoked Evelyn, Liam would inevitably intervene. And in her current position - with divorce papers practically signed - she had no right to influence Liam's actions anymore.

Liam's gaze darkened as he watched Olivia's hand on Daniel's wrist. Without hesitation, he strode forward and snatched the rabbit-shaped lantern from the auctioneer's hands.

His commanding presence silenced the room instantly.

After claiming the prize, Liam handed it directly to Evelyn.

His voice was ice-cold as he declared, "I was the first to speak up, which makes this rightfully ours. While we should show compassion to those with disabilities, that doesn't automatically make them correct. If pity determined every dispute, justice would cease to exist, wouldn't it?"

Olivia's head snapped up at Liam's words. She took an involuntary step forward, her hands lifting slightly as if to explain - she'd never meant it that way. She only wanted what was rightfully hers.

But then she hesitated. If this was how Liam saw her, would any explanation matter?

Her thoughts tangled like yarn in a kitten's paws. Tears pricked at her eyes, but she refused to let them fall.

Surrounded by curious onlookers, Olivia clenched her jaw and turned to Daniel, gesturing that she needed to leave and rest.

Daniel caught the pain in Olivia's eyes. His glare at Liam could have frozen hell over.

The air between the two men crackled with unspoken threats.

As Daniel led Olivia away, Liam's control finally snapped.

"Olivia!" His voice carried both command and unexpected hurt. "You see me and don't even say hello?"

Too exhausted to respond, Olivia kept walking without turning back.

Liam's frustration erupted. He stormed past her, his expensive cologne mixing with the faint scent of cigarettes, leaving bitterness in his wake.

His abrupt departure felt like the final punctuation to their relationship - two souls now walking separate paths, with no more waiting between them.

Seeing her opportunity, Evelyn hurried after Liam.

When Liam reached his car, he started the engine without hesitation.

Desperate, Evelyn tapped on the window, her eyes pleading. "Liam, what about our dinner plans?"

He didn't even glance at her. "Business calls. My security will take you back to the hotel. Call if you need anything."

Evelyn's frustration boiled over. "I thought we were staying together tonight?"

Liam's stony silence was answer enough.

Evelyn's face flushed with anger. Just when she thought she was making progress, Liam's indifference proved otherwise.

Watching his car disappear, Evelyn stormed back to her room. A long shower somewhat restored her mood - until an insistent knock interrupted her solitude.

Olivia assumed it was Natalie or Isabella. The hotel's excellent security gave her little reason for concern, and she had a panic button installed in her suite for emergencies.

Comforted by these precautions, Olivia opened the door - only to find Liam standing there, his expression stormy.

Startled, she immediately tried to close the door, but Liam wedged his foot in the gap.

Just as the door nearly shut, a pained grunt came from the hallway.

Concern overriding caution, Olivia reopened the door to find Liam still there, his face a mask of displeasure.

Despite the pain in his wrist, Liam couldn't help a bitter chuckle at Olivia's cold demeanor. "So now you're the victim here?"

Olivia signed that she needed rest, emphasizing her important schedule tomorrow required all her energy.

After a pause, she made it clear she didn't want to see either him or Evelyn at Westfield University tomorrow.

Better to avoid awkward encounters altogether, she reasoned.

Liam's expression darkened, his handsome features turning severe. He caught Olivia's wrist mid-gesture, his grip unyielding.

Olivia winced. She wanted to tell him he was hurting her, but no sound came out.

Liam's voice dripped with accusation. "You're pushing me away because you don't want me seeing you with Daniel, aren't you? I can't believe you'd avoid me just to be with him."

Olivia felt a surge of indignation. A date with Daniel? He was just a friend. Given Liam's obvious closeness with Evelyn, how dare he make demands of her?

Reading Olivia's expression, Liam's eyes turned glacial. Without warning, he scooped her up and carried her into the suite, kicking the door shut behind them.

Olivia struggled, but her resistance ended when Liam pinned her to the bed. She lay silent, her eyes begging for understanding.

In a moment that blurred punishment and passion, Liam nipped at her earlobe. Feeling her tremble, he intensified his touch.

As confusion and desire warred within Olivia, Liam's hand slipped beneath her clothes, his touch scorching as if trying to brand her from within.

Then reality struck. With sudden clarity, Olivia bit down hard on Liam's tongue.

Liam recoiled with a pained frown, his expression shifting from desire to shocked anger as he sat up, staring at her.

Olivia clutched her stomach, her face contorted in pain and fear.

Seeing her distress, Liam's anger dissolved into immediate concern.
###Chapter 98

"Did I hurt you?" Liam's voice was rough with concern.

Olivia instinctively curled into herself, creating a physical barrier between them with her folded arms.

Liam's brow furrowed. "What's wrong? Are you in pain?"

Her fingers brushed against her stomach before she shook her head, avoiding his gaze as she gestured about her menstrual cycle.

A harsh laugh escaped Liam's lips as he gripped her chin. "If you don't want me touching you, just say so. I could recite your cycle better than you. Did you really think that excuse would work?"

Heat flooded Olivia's cheeks - equal parts anger and embarrassment. How could he possibly know her that intimately? It shouldn't have been possible.

Her brief hesitation only confirmed Liam's suspicions. His expression darkened dangerously, making Olivia shrink back against the headboard.

With one swift movement, Liam pulled her against his chest, their bodies pressed together while his voice remained icy. "You've become quite the liar. I'm canceling your independent living arrangement. I'll call Westfield University myself. We're leaving tonight."

Leave with him? Olivia's eyes widened in panic. Pushing through her discomfort, she signed rapidly - she had commitments here, he couldn't just dictate her life anymore.

Liam's lips curled in a cruel smile. "Consider this the price of deception. If you don't want to come, then tell me the truth. Do you find me so repulsive? Or is there someone else? Was it Daniel who put these divorce ideas in your head?"

As Liam's accusations grew wilder, Olivia's anger gave way to crushing hurt. She stared at him defiantly. Here she was, carrying his child, while he hurled baseless accusations without even realizing her condition.

Seeing the pain in Olivia's eyes, Liam's tirade faltered, an uncomfortable weight settling in his own chest.

The silence between them grew heavy.

Olivia watched from the corner of her eye as Liam pulled out his phone, booking two first-class tickets with sharp, angry taps.

Unable to take it anymore, she sprang from the bed and flung the hotel door open, gesturing violently toward the hallway in clear dismissal.

Liam stood frozen, his face like carved marble. "Is this really what you want?"

Her hands moved sharply - they were getting divorced, her choices were no longer his concern.

Liam's eyes narrowed dangerously as he seized her wrist in an iron grip.

He opened his mouth to respond but froze when Daniel emerged from the elevator, a gift box in hand, walking purposefully toward Olivia's room.

Daniel stopped short at the unexpected sight of the open door and the tense scene before him.

All warmth drained from Daniel's expression the moment he saw Liam.

Feeling Liam's grip tighten painfully, Olivia turned to see Daniel standing there. She instinctively tried to pull away.

Instead of releasing her, Liam yanked her closer against him.

Silent but furious, Olivia struggled against his hold, her entire body screaming resistance despite her physical disadvantage.

Liam maintained his possessive grip, smirking challengingly at Daniel.

Daniel took an aggressive step forward, his voice steel. "Let her go. Can't you see she doesn't want this?"

Liam's response was deceptively calm. "Her wants are irrelevant. I'm her husband. Who would know her better than me?"

Daniel's hands clenched into fists, his protective stance unmistakable.

"If you actually cared about Olivia, I'd step aside. But seeing how you treat her, flaunting your mistress... I thought Evelyn was shameless, but you've outdone her completely today."

Panic fluttered in Olivia's chest. She tried to intervene - everyone knew Evelyn held a special place in Liam's heart.

Liam's face hardened, his voice cutting. "You seem to have too much free time, meddling where you don't belong. Whatever issues exist between Olivia and me are ours to resolve. We don't need interference from outsiders."

Daniel took a deep, frustrated breath, his gaze shifting to Olivia still trapped in Liam's arms. "Come with me, Olivia. Let's go find Natalie," he urged.

Olivia instinctively struggled again, trying to break free.

Liam's grip became punishing.

A sharp gasp escaped Olivia's lips, tears springing to her eyes from the pain.

Liam's voice turned glacial. "I'll be staying with my wife tonight. I trust you won't disturb us?"

His words landed like physical blows.

Daniel's fists clenched helplessly.

Seizing the moment of distraction, Olivia finally wrenched free. She turned to Daniel, signing quickly: "Don't worry about me. You should rest."

But Daniel remained stubborn. "Olivia, you don't want to be alone with him, do you? Don't be afraid. I'll protect you. He lost any right to you after what he's done."

Olivia shook her head vehemently.

The hope in Daniel's eyes dimmed. Her refusal was clear - she wouldn't leave with him.

With visible effort, Daniel extended the gift box. "I brought your favorite fruits. Get some rest, okay? Call me if you need anything."

Before Olivia could accept it, Liam snatched the box and threw it into the nearest trash bin.

His face was unreadable. "She's fine. You can leave now."

Daniel stormed off, his frustration evident in every stiff movement.

Olivia turned back to Liam, her expression equally icy. Her hands moved: "I don't want to share a room tonight. I need rest, and Evelyn might visit. You'll only disturb me."

Liam's irritation flared. "What's really bothering you, Olivia? Afraid I'll interrupt your sleep? Or worried you'll miss another chance to see Daniel?"

His hand closed painfully around her shoulder. "We're still married. Isn't it a bit soon for you to be getting so close to Daniel?"

Olivia had a dozen retorts about his relationship with Evelyn ready, but the words died unspoken. Arguing with Liam never felt fair. She always ended up feeling indebted to him and the Blackwood family in some way. Maybe she was.

A heavy sadness settled in Olivia's chest, forming an ache she couldn't swallow away.
###Chapter 99

Olivia's stomach twisted into knots. She pulled away from Liam's embrace and turned toward the bed.

Liam's dark eyes burned into Olivia's retreating figure, his jaw tightening with barely restrained emotion.

Burying herself under the covers, Olivia waited until she heard the door click shut behind Liam before emerging.

A shaky breath escaped her lips - equal parts relief and heartache. There was no stopping her husband from visiting that woman. The worst part? She was expected to smile through the betrayal.

Cradling her abdomen, Olivia seriously considered divorce for the first time. Maybe it was the only way to protect herself and their unborn child.

Morning came quicker than expected, bringing mercifully dreamless sleep.

Natalie's cheerful voice greeted Olivia when she opened her eyes. Daniel stood beside his sister, already dressed and waiting.

As Olivia opened the door, Daniel's eyes darted past her, his shoulders relaxing when he confirmed Liam wasn't present.

Natalie linked arms with Olivia. "Let's hit the Westfield University cafeteria! It's been years since graduation. I barely remember what their pancakes taste like."

Olivia's spirits lifted instantly at Natalie's infectious energy.

The quartet headed to campus for breakfast, the morning sun casting golden light across the historic buildings.

The university buzzed with activity - students rushing about, last-minute preparations underway everywhere.

Surrounded by the youthful energy, Olivia felt a pang of nostalgia for simpler times when her biggest worry was passing exams.

How quickly life changed. Those carefree days felt like someone else's memories now.

They searched the exhibition area, but Olivia's designated space was conspicuously absent.

Natalie frowned. "Where's your presentation area? Didn't they arrange for you to demonstrate restoration techniques?"

Olivia shook her head, equally confused. The schedule had clearly outlined a small platform where she'd give a live demonstration while Isabella translated. There was even talk of a Q&A session if time permitted.

Yet after checking every platform, Olivia's spot remained missing.

Natalie sprang into action, interrogating staff and students alike, but no one had answers.

Unable to locate Nathaniel, Olivia pulled out her phone to contact him.

His reply came swiftly via voice message. "Olivia, my deepest apologies. An emergency came up. Vice Principal Harrison Ellington is on site - I'll send his photo. Again, so sorry for the inconvenience."

The background noise in Nathaniel's message suggested chaos. Olivia had Isabella text back their understanding.

With Nathaniel's photo, they spotted the vice president in the crowded venue.

Harrison appeared harried and visibly irritated when he noticed their approach, deliberately turning away.

Undeterred, Natalie intercepted him. "Excuse me, Vice President Ellington?"

Harrison's frown deepened. "Yes? What is it?"

Before Natalie could explain, Harrison cut in, "If you need assistance, please speak to a staff member. Guests should remain in designated areas."

Natalie remained calm. "Actually, we're invited guests."

This information softened Harrison's demeanor slightly. "I see. And you are...?"

Isabella stepped in. "This is Olivia Sinclair, invited by Mr. Nathaniel Bradford. Could you direct us to her exhibition space?"

Recognition flickered across Harrison's face, followed by confusion. "Olivia... that name does sound familiar," he muttered.

He vaguely recalled Nathaniel mentioning something about a special guest, but he'd assumed it was just another pretty face to enhance the event's appeal. The details had slipped his mind.

Harrison's expression cleared slightly. "Ah, right. You're giving a presentation? Everything's prepared. Are you ready, or do you need proper attire? Either way, make it quick. I'm extremely busy."

Olivia remained silent, though Natalie and Isabella exchanged shocked glances.

Isabella asked quietly, "Is this really the arrangement Mr. Bradford made?"

Harrison's patience wore thin. What more could they possibly want?

His gaze then fell on Olivia, who stood out strikingly despite her silence. Yet she seemed oddly out of place amidst the chaos.

Exasperated, Harrison approached Olivia directly. "Tell me what you need. I don't have all day."

Olivia typed rapidly on her phone before a synthesized voice spoke: "My apologies. Speaking is difficult for me."

Harrison initially thought she was being difficult, then realization dawned. Despite curious onlookers, he blurted, "You can't speak? Then why would Nathaniel invite you? What's the point?"

All eyes turned toward them.

Olivia felt the weight of dozens of stares. She clenched her fists, forcing herself to remain calm.

Isabella's face darkened. "Shall I call Nathaniel right now to verify how guests should be treated?"

Harrison scoffed. "It was a misunderstanding. Can't you see I'm overwhelmed? We only have one speaking slot available."

Secretly, Harrison doubted their claims. If Olivia were truly important, Nathaniel would be here. His absence spoke volumes.

As Natalie prepared to retort, Daniel placed a restraining hand on her arm. "Don't make a scene. Olivia came for the exhibition, not just the invitation."

Daniel introduced himself to Harrison with practiced charm.

Finally, Harrison agreed to arrange a small display area in a quiet corner - though no interviews or special accommodations would be made.

Isabella, more guilty than angry, apologized to Olivia. "I should have confirmed everything earlier. This is my fault."

Olivia signed gently that it wasn't Isabella's fault. She understood her lack of recognition stemmed from her reclusive nature.

The painful truth? Talent meant nothing without visibility in their world.

Setting up her tools on the makeshift platform, Olivia began her restoration work.

Westfield University's artifact restoration program was always conducted in carefully controlled environments.

Now, Olivia's meticulous work drew curious crowds, as such delicate procedures were rarely performed publicly.

Though seated in a corner, Olivia became completely absorbed in her work, her skilled hands moving with graceful precision under the sunlight. Her long fingers danced across the ancient artifact with surprising delicacy.
###Chapter 100

Olivia instantly became the center of attention.

The crowd pressed closer, bombarding her with questions about her craft.

Isabella stood nearby, beaming as she answered inquiries on Olivia's behalf.

No one seemed to mind Olivia's silence. If anything, it only added to her mystique.

"Her technique is mesmerizing. The tools practically dance in her fingers."

"I'd kill for half her skill in artifact restoration. My professor would stop failing me."

"There's something almost spiritual about her focus. The silence makes her work more profound to watch."

As the gathering grew, Isabella seized the opportunity to share Olivia's background, increasing her exposure.

Olivia's delicate features and serene smile only enhanced her appeal.

Dozens of phones appeared, capturing the moment.

Even Westfield University's media team redirected their cameras toward Olivia, captivated by her quiet presence.

Harrison observed from the shadows, his face unreadable. His carefully orchestrated opening ceremony was being overshadowed by a mute woman he'd deemed unworthy. If this event failed, the blame would land squarely on him.

Steeling himself, Harrison approached. As cameras turned his way, his stern expression melted into practiced charm. "Ladies and gentlemen," he announced, "I encourage you to explore our students' other exhibits. Your appreciation for their efforts would be most welcome."

A voice from the crowd challenged, "Wasn't this woman invited by Westfield University?"

Harrison responded smoothly, "At Westfield, we believe in inclusive participation. Anyone inspired to share their passion is welcome to do so."

The implication rippled through the crowd.

"So she just showed up uninvited? Why wouldn't she clarify that?"

"I nearly made her the focus of my article. That would've been embarrassing."

"She's clearly an influencer here for clout."

Natalie bristled at the accusations, ready to defend their invitation.

Olivia caught her wrist, shaking her head in warning.

After Harrison's departure, no one remained interested in their side of the story.

Isabella fumed. "What kind of game is Westfield playing? They invite you then treat you like this?"

Olivia thought of Nathaniel's sincerity and shook her head. Setting down her tools, she signed that it was likely a misunderstanding, and she was simply grateful to participate.

Her calm gestures soothed Isabella's anger. "You're right. If this escalates, we have the contracts to prove our position."

Natalie nodded. "The paperwork protects us."

Observers watched Olivia's composure with mixed reactions, though none could deny her restoration skills.

Emboldened by her tranquility, a man approached about repairing his heirloom.

Olivia declined payment, signing she was here to connect with fellow enthusiasts.

They didn't know her standard rate started at $10,000.

As word spread, more people sought Olivia's expertise.

Harrison's attempts to redirect attention failed repeatedly.

Then a sharp voice cut through the murmur. "Can you fix this?"

The crowd parted for the newcomer.

Evelyn removed her sunglasses, revealing striking features.

Olivia's breath hitched. Dread coiled in her stomach.

With everyone watching, Olivia couldn't refuse. She gestured toward the line's end.

Evelyn scoffed. "Really? You think you're some celebrity demanding queues? Even A-listers aren't this pretentious."

Natalie's face flushed. "Better than being a homew—"

Isabella yanked her back before she could finish. Calling Evelyn out publicly would only complicate Olivia and Liam's situation.

The crowd eyed Evelyn's designer ensemble. Though resentful of her cutting in, no one protested as they made way.

Olivia, appearing exhausted, signed that the instigator would only embarrass themselves before witnesses.

To everyone's surprise, Evelyn understood. She smirked. "Making a scene? I just want something fixed. Do you have a problem with me? Won't help me? What exactly did I do to deserve this?"

Olivia's mind raced to de-escalate. She gestured to her worktable.

Evelyn smirked and retrieved a tattered bag from her bodyguard.

Olivia froze. Her hands trembled violently.

She prayed it wasn't what she feared. Opening the bag confirmed her nightmare.

Inside lay the first gift she'd ever made for Liam - now deliberately shattered, dirt ground into the cracks.

As Olivia's face contorted in pain, Evelyn's satisfaction grew. "Honestly, it was nothing special. Just some trash my boyfriend got from his ex. He said if I hated it, he'd destroy it. I thought it was hideous. Didn't expect him to actually stomp on it repeatedly. Asked if that made me happy." She licked her lips. "Later I thought... maybe it was a sincere gift after all. Pity he crushed it so thoroughly."
###Chapter 101

Evelyn Hartley stared provocatively at Olivia Sinclair. "This should be child's play for someone like you, right?"

A bitter taste flooded Olivia's mouth, spreading through her veins until her fingertips tingled with suppressed emotion.

Olivia couldn't fathom how Liam Blackwood could speak so disparagingly about her work behind her back. Surely he'd recognize her handwriting—she'd attached her personal note to the piece.

Her mind drifted to their shared past.

As children, Liam had constantly teased Olivia about her messy penmanship. He'd insisted on daily practice sessions until her handwriting transformed into something elegant.

One afternoon, Olivia had mischievously mixed her writing samples with others of similar style, challenging Liam to identify hers.

He'd picked it out instantly. "You're practically my protégé," he'd said with that infuriating smirk. "I'd know your strokes anywhere—though you've developed some peculiar flourishes of your own."

Olivia had hidden her laughter behind her hands at his arrogance.

How could she have known those trivial moments would become priceless memories now out of reach?

The shattered sculpture before her seemed to mock those lost days, a painful reminder that the past might remain forever unrecoverable.

Evelyn widened her eyes in faux concern. "What's the matter? Is this beyond your skills? I'm no expert, but even I could manage this repair."

A bystander bristled at Evelyn's tone. "You're being unreasonable. Why attack Olivia? She's not at fault here."

"Exactly," another chimed in. "Her hesitation probably stems from your attitude."

"Olivia restored my nearly destroyed painting last week," a third person added. "This is simple by comparison."

Their defense only deepened Olivia's sorrow. She drew a steadying breath, wrestling her emotions under control before meeting Evelyn's gaze with practiced calm. With a silent gesture, she indicated she'd handle the repair.

Evelyn's lips curled in triumph. "I'll await your masterpiece then." She strode away, the click of her heels echoing her victory.

Natalie Bennett leaned close, whispering, "She's clearly baiting you. Why agree? What if she claims you damaged it further?"

Olivia shook her head dismissively. These objects meant little—just as Liam had so easily discarded her feelings.

Pushing Evelyn's item aside, Olivia returned to other clients' work.

Her eyes kept searching the room for any sign of Liam, but he remained conspicuously absent.

The realization settled like lead in her chest. Of course he wouldn't come—not when he was supposedly on a date with Evelyn. Her presence would only spoil their romantic outing.

When Olivia finished the repair, she had Isabella Rossi message Evelyn to collect it.

"I'm busy," came the breezy reply. "Why don't you deliver it to me?"

Isabella's voice turned icy. "If unclaimed by day's end, we'll dispose of it."

Evelyn's laugh crackled through the phone. "Then tell Olivia Liam will collect it. Consider it my gift—a chance for her to see him again."

Natalie snatched the phone. "You shameless homewrecker! Liam might be blind to your scheming, but everyone else sees your true colors. Olivia's interactions with Liam have always been honorable—unlike your underhanded manipulations."

"You!" Evelyn's voice dropped to a venomous whisper. "I've said my piece. This is between Olivia and me."

The line went dead.

Olivia patted Natalie's shoulder in silent thanks.

Natalie's expression softened. "You don't have to go. If Liam complains later, we'll all vouch for you."

Olivia shook her head firmly. She needed to face this. Liam had already rejected this gift once. If he came to retrieve it, wouldn't that just give him another opportunity to spurn it—and her—publicly?

This had been a gift from her heart. She couldn't bear to see it mistreated again. While she wouldn't return it to Evelyn, certain clarifications were necessary.

Natalie frowned. "She's plotting something. Walking into her trap serves no purpose."

Olivia puzzled over Evelyn's motives. With Liam's devotion secured, what more could the woman want? Besides, Olivia had been seeking a divorce. She'd happily share that detail if provoked.

If Evelyn pushed too far, Olivia might just prolong the divorce proceedings. Then she wouldn't be the only one eager for resolution.

Recognizing Olivia's determination, the others reluctantly stepped back.

Daniel Bennett moved forward. "I'll accompany you. You won't face her alone."

Olivia nodded gratefully.

Evelyn had chosen Westfield University's humanities building for their meeting—an odd location that raised Olivia's suspicions.

As Olivia and Daniel approached the stairs, Evelyn descended with theatrical timing.

"Olivia alone," Evelyn commanded, chin lifted. "Mr. Bennett, I'd prefer this remain between us."

Daniel's gaze turned flinty. "Can you guarantee Olivia's safety?"

Evelyn's laugh tinkled like broken glass. "Playing the white knight? Should I show Liam those cozy photos of you two? Given they're still married, he might find them... illuminating."

Daniel's hands clenched, then forcibly relaxed. He wouldn't give Evelyn ammunition to hurt Olivia further.
###Chapter 102

Daniel stepped back, his concern for Olivia evident in his piercing gaze. "Call me the moment you need anything," he insisted.

Olivia gave a silent nod before following Evelyn up the marble staircase.

They reached a dimly lit landing where Evelyn suddenly whirled around. "Give it to me," she demanded, palm outstretched.

Olivia's grip tightened around the small package. She typed rapidly on her phone and turned the screen toward Evelyn: "This belongs to me. It was meant as a gift for Liam, but since he refused it, I'll keep it. You won't destroy what's mine."

Evelyn's laughter echoed coldly through the stairwell. She stepped closer, arms crossed. "How transparent. You're keeping it as leverage - to make Liam believe I've wronged you, then use this pathetic gift to worm your way back into his life."

Olivia's jaw clenched. She activated her phone's voice function: "You're mistaken. I'm done with Liam. That's why I agreed to meet today - to make this clear. After the divorce, we'll be strangers. Stay out of my life, and I'll stay out of yours."

Evelyn studied Olivia's face like a predator examining prey. She searched for any flicker of hesitation but found only steel resolve.

This wasn't what Evelyn had anticipated. She'd assumed Olivia's divorce talk was a ploy, but the woman before her seemed genuinely determined.

Lately, Evelyn had noticed Liam's growing indifference. The few times he showed warmth coincided with Olivia's presence - a pattern too consistent to ignore.

Evelyn had expected Liam to turn to her after the divorce announcement. Instead, he'd withdrawn completely.

Now Olivia's actions confirmed Evelyn's worst fear - it was Olivia who wanted the divorce, not Liam. Liam was being rejected.

The realization burned through Evelyn. She was the perfect match for Liam Blackwood! Olivia had stolen her rightful place, and now dared to act magnanimous in leaving?

Olivia remained oblivious to Evelyn's inner turmoil, only noticing how her smile had frozen into something dangerous.

Thinking Evelyn needed further assurance, Olivia typed again: "I won't contact Liam first. Just keep him away from me."

Evelyn's lips curled. "So if he comes crawling back, you'll graciously accept?"

The suggestion startled Olivia. Liam would never seek her out. She'd said her piece. With a final gesture, she turned to leave.

"Olivia!" Evelyn's voice cracked like a whip.

Then came the lunge.

Olivia's reflexes saved her. Instead of turning, she grabbed the banister and sidestepped just as Evelyn's hands shot out.

Evelyn's momentum carried her forward. She teetered for one horrifying second before her stiletto snapped. A scream tore through the air as she tumbled down the stairs.

The sickening crack of bone meeting marble.

Blood pooled instantly.

Olivia stood frozen, mouth open in a silent scream.

Daniel arrived seconds later, his shocked gaze darting between Olivia and the crumpled figure below.

"Are you hurt?" His hands hovered protectively as he scanned Olivia for injuries.

She shook violently, fingers trembling too much to dial emergency services. Someone below had already called for help.

The approaching footsteps were swift and organized.

Then Liam appeared.

Olivia's breath hitched as Daniel moved to shield her.

Liam's expression darkened when he saw Evelyn's unconscious form. His glare could have melted steel as he carefully gathered Evelyn into his arms.

Olivia tried to explain, but Liam cut her off with a venomous look at Daniel. "No excuse justifies attacking a defenseless woman. This was deliberate. The police will handle this."

Olivia's mouth fell open. She wanted to protest - only she and Evelyn had been present initially. The staff Evelyn brought could confirm this.

But Daniel squeezed her wrist in warning before addressing Liam with icy precision: "Your accusations are baseless. We arrived to find Miss Hartley already fallen. Neither of us touched her."

Liam's voice dropped dangerously. "The authorities will determine the truth. But mark my words - whoever did this will pay."

His words felt like daggers aimed at Olivia's heart. Why not accuse her directly? Was he protecting his reputation since they remained legally married?

The thought chilled Olivia to her core.

Paramedics swarmed in, efficiently stabilizing Evelyn.

Liam followed without a backward glance, treating Olivia like a stranger.

Tears blurred Olivia's vision as she noticed the shattered sculpture in the corner - its fragments scattered through Evelyn's blood. Her parting gift, destroyed.

###Chapter 103

Olivia's last glimmer of hope for Liam was now shattered, just like the broken sculpture. But the nightmare wasn’t over yet.

As Olivia and Daniel descended the stairs, they were ambushed by a swarm of reporters.

The media had been covering the exhibition, but rumors of a girl falling down the stairs had turned the scene into chaos.

Olivia wondered how the news had spread so fast. Was this Liam’s way of punishing her?

But there was no time to dwell on that. Daniel quickly shrugged off his coat and draped it over Olivia’s shoulders.

She shook her head firmly, pushing it away. She gestured that she was nobody—just an ordinary girl who wouldn’t be affected by the cameras. But Daniel, with his status, would face scrutiny if he were caught in the scandal.

He gave her a reassuring smile. "Don’t worry about me. I’ll handle it. But you need to stay out of this mess."

The moment they stepped outside, reporters swarmed them.

Despite the confusion, the sight of Olivia and Daniel together sparked a frenzy of questions.

"Are you students here? Can you tell us what happened inside? Was there a fight that led to the girl falling?"

"Is the girl connected to you in any way?"

"Was this a love triangle gone wrong?"

Daniel seized the opportunity to guide Olivia through the crowd.

Reluctantly accepting his help, she used her slender frame to slip past the reporters, leaving them to focus on Daniel.

With practiced ease, he faced the cameras, his expression unreadable. "First, I’m not a student here. Second, we know the girl, but I can’t explain what happened. Third, if you have questions, take them to the police. Harassing a bystander won’t get you answers."

His calm, authoritative tone defused the situation quickly.

Meanwhile, Natalie and Isabella caught up with Olivia.

Knowing about Evelyn’s fall, they didn’t bombard her with questions. Instead, they surrounded her, offering comfort and checking if she was hurt.

Warmth spread through Olivia’s chest, melting the icy dread in her limbs. For the first time in a while, she felt like she belonged.

Once she had calmed down, Olivia typed out the details of what had happened, her phone’s text-to-speech function narrating her words.

"I was leaving when Evelyn called out to me. The next thing I knew, she was falling. At the time, I thought maybe she was dizzy or lost her balance. Before she fell, I felt something rush toward me, so I grabbed the railing and pressed myself against it. It all happened so fast—I didn’t have time to react and pull her back. Now, I wish I had been quicker. Maybe I could’ve stopped her."

Despite their history, Olivia didn’t wish harm on Evelyn.

She remembered how she had lost her voice—an accident. No one wanted tragedy in their life.

Evelyn had always been proud of her beauty. If this fall scarred her, how would she cope?

Olivia felt a pang of pity, though not true sympathy.

Isabella, however, frowned and pressed Olivia for more details.

Confused but obliging, Olivia reenacted the scene with Natalie’s help.

Isabella’s expression darkened. She pulled Olivia aside and whispered, "I think Evelyn didn’t just fall. She might’ve tried to push you, but you reacted in time, and she lost her balance instead."

Olivia’s stomach twisted. She and Evelyn had their issues, but attempted murder? That was extreme.

Isabella tightened her grip on Olivia’s hand. "It’s just a theory, but it makes sense. Why else would she fall like that? If I’m right, once she wakes up, she’ll blame you for everything."

"Olivia, you—" Isabella hesitated, concern flickering in her eyes.

Olivia forced a smile and gestured that she would handle whatever came her way.

Isabella sighed, unconvinced.

With the exhibition abruptly canceled, all they could do was go home.

Back in her apartment, Olivia couldn’t shake Isabella’s words. Her thoughts spiraled as she kept checking the news for updates.

But nothing new surfaced. She decided to wait for Nathaniel to finish his task so she could request the security footage.

Late that night, sharp knocks jolted her awake.

Heart pounding, Olivia crept to the door and typed a message on her phone.

Then, a cold voice called out. "Olivia, open the door."

It was Liam. His tone was icy, his mood clearly foul.

She hesitated. He was probably here about Evelyn.

When she didn’t move, he spoke again, sharper this time. "I know you’re there. Open up, or I’ll let myself in."

With no choice, she unlocked the door.

Liam strode in, his tall frame dominating the space. The chill of the night clung to him.

As he passed, Olivia shivered.

His gaze locked onto hers, frosty and unreadable.

She quickly gestured that she had nothing to do with Evelyn’s fall.

Liam’s jaw tightened. Then, to her shock, he said, "I know you didn’t push her. It was Daniel. He’s always hated Evelyn, and in their argument, he shoved her by accident. This isn’t your fault, but you need to come with me to apologize. It started because of you."

Olivia’s eyes widened in disbelief. Her hands moved frantically—No, Daniel wasn’t even there when it happened! He only came after she fell!

Liam exhaled sharply, then suddenly grabbed her wrist and pulled her close.

His dark eyes burned into hers, emotions swirling too violently for her to decipher.

His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "If it wasn’t him, then are you saying it was you?"

A sharp clarity cut through Olivia’s panic. Her chest tightened with indignation.

So that was why he blamed Daniel.

Tears pricked her eyes as she signed furiously, "You don’t believe me. You think I did it, but you’re worried about the scandal. So you’re pinning it on Daniel and still expecting me to apologize? Liam, you know me. I would never do something like this!"

###Chapter 104

Liam avoided Olivia's question with a chilling stare.

His voice was like ice. "Why haven't you visited the hospital? Evelyn has a severe head injury. The doctors say the scar might never fade. Think about how she must feel."

Olivia felt the accusation in Liam's gaze burning through her. Her hands shook as she signed that she didn't mind his concern for Evelyn, but begged him to leave her out of it since she wasn't involved.

A humorless laugh escaped Liam's lips. "Do I need to spell it out, Olivia? Why are you so desperate to defend Daniel? It makes me wonder what's really between you two."

Her heart cracked like thin ice. She signed forcefully that her relationship with Daniel was none of his business. There was nothing between them, and neither would apologize for something they didn't do.

"Oh?" Liam's jaw tightened visibly.

He stormed out after delivering his final blow: "This is on you. Don't come crying to me later!"

The slamming door echoed through Olivia's chest. Alone at last, the tears she'd been holding back flooded down her cheeks.

She'd prepared for this moment, warned herself not to hope. Yet the pain still cut deeper than expected.

Meanwhile, Liam sat rigid in his car, knuckles white around a cigarette.

Sebastian, his driver, kept silent.

Smoke curled around Liam's sharp features as he struggled to contain his fury. Every exhale seemed to release another wave of pent-up rage. His muscles tensed like a predator ready to strike.

When his phone buzzed, Liam barely glanced at the caller ID before rejecting the call.

The Hartleys had been trying to reach him all morning.

Sebastian finally spoke up. "Sir, the entire Hartley family is at Mercy Hospital. They're blaming your wife for what happened."

"Not my problem," Liam sneered. "I tried to help her, but she's too busy playing knight for Daniel. If she cares so much about him, let him deal with it."

Only three people had been present when Evelyn fell - Evelyn herself, Olivia, and Daniel. Evelyn's security detail had been keeping their distance.

By the time Liam arrived after receiving word of the accident, he'd only seen Olivia and Daniel together. Outside, reporters swarmed like vultures.

Truthfully, the Hartleys didn't concern Liam. But when the story exploded online, everything changed.

Daniel had his family's protection and resources to handle the fallout if blame shifted to him.

Though the investigation was ongoing, Liam believed pinning it on Daniel would protect Olivia by redirecting the Hartleys' wrath. Yet Olivia seemed determined to shield Daniel instead, rendering all his efforts pointless.

Sebastian watched Liam's mounting frustration. "Sir, are we really doing nothing?"

Liam's gaze flickered to Olivia's window where light still glowed. "If she needs help, she can ask Daniel. Why should I care? Take me to the hospital."

At that last sentence, Sebastian sighed quietly. He knew Liam wouldn't truly abandon Olivia. Their marriage was complicated, and as an outsider, his input was limited.

Olivia endured a sleepless night, her phone bombarded by morning.

The incident had spawned countless rumors.

Some claimed Daniel and Evelyn had been lovers, with Olivia as the homewrecker who'd driven Daniel to push Evelyn in a fit of rage.

Others whispered Olivia and Daniel were secret lovers caught by Evelyn, leading them to conspire against her.

Every version painted Olivia and Daniel as villains.

Complicating matters, anonymous insiders leaked "truths" online. "There's more to this story than meets the eye."

Soon, salacious theories about the tangled relationships between Olivia, Daniel, Liam and Evelyn spread like wildfire across social media.

One comment read: "So the injured girl was the other woman? But quiet Olivia isn't so innocent. That demure act hides a cheating wife."

Another countered: "Don't spread lies! Liam and Evelyn were childhood sweethearts. Olivia used her status as the Blackwoods' ward to force Liam into marriage while carrying on with other men. She dares call Evelyn the other woman? If I were Liam, I'd stray too. Some women can't be trusted."

A third added: "Evelyn's fall was no accident. This reeks of a setup."

The online vitriol escalated by the minute.

Though accustomed to hostility, Olivia had never faced such widespread public condemnation.

The vicious comments left her feeling helpless and furious, especially worrying about dragging the Bennetts and Gregory into this mess.

She'd planned to have Isabella contact them while she laid low to avoid further complications.

But before Olivia could reach Isabella, unexpected defenders emerged online.

Gregory's post caused particular stir: "I know Olivia well. Normally I avoid online drama, but the cruelty here is appalling. Why attack someone you don't know? If ignorant, silence is golden."

Several of Gregory's followers amplified his message.

Olivia was stunned - but mostly deeply grateful.

Yet despite these voices, the online storm raged on.

Soon, the Hartleys found her.

As Olivia left her apartment building, black sedans boxed her in. Menacing figures emerged.

Their leader grabbed her arm roughly. "Someone wants to see you. Come quietly."

Olivia struggled uselessly against his grip. Mute, she typed frantically on her phone: "What do you want?"

The man smirked. "You'll see. Don't worry - we're civilized people. We won't hurt you."

Realization struck. "You're with the Hartleys?"

Her question earned only a contemptuous snort as they shoved her into a car.

Meanwhile, Daniel arrived just in time to see Olivia being forced into the vehicle by the ominous group.
###Chapter 105

Olivia's breath hitched as she watched Liam's car disappear around the corner. The threatening figures had vanished like shadows at dawn.

Her pulse pounded in her ears as she followed the grim-faced security team into Mercy Hospital. The sterile white walls closed around her like a cage.

The private ward was empty except for unfamiliar faces. At its center stood an aristocratic couple radiating icy disdain - Evelyn's parents, the Hartleys.

Olivia squared her shoulders, refusing to let her trembling hands betray her fear.

Without warning, a rough shove sent her sprawling. The polished floor burned against her skin as mocking laughter echoed above her.

Beatrice Hartley's lip curled. "Look at this pitiful creature who dared hurt my daughter. Such a delicate face hiding such cruelty!"

Olivia's palms stung where they'd scraped against the tile. She typed with shaking fingers: "I didn't cause Evelyn's accident. Call the police if you believe I'm guilty, but this harassment is illegal."

Frederick Hartley's chuckle sent chills down her spine. "Police? Who do you think controls this city's law enforcement, little mouse?"

Olivia's nails bit into her palms. The Hartleys' reputation for ruthlessness was legendary. She typed faster: "What do you want? An apology? The truth is Evelyn fell alone. We should be finding what really happened."

Beatrice made a sharp gesture. A guard's slap cracked across Olivia's face, sending her reeling.

Frederick held up a hand. "Our terms are simple. First, you'll nurse Evelyn back to health. Second, you'll divorce Liam. Finally, you'll publicly admit you stole him from Evelyn."

Olivia's blood ran cold. She typed: "I'm still Liam's wife. Do you really want to make an enemy of the Blackwoods?"

Beatrice smirked, swiping through her phone. The screen showed Liam keeping vigil at Evelyn's bedside, Margaret Winslow feeding Evelyn fruit like a doting mother.

The message was clear - the Blackwoods had already chosen sides.

"Call Liam," Olivia typed desperately. "I can't decide this alone."

Beatrice laughed. "Still clinging to hope? Westfield University's Vice Principal Ellington confirms witnesses saw you push Evelyn. What say you now?"

Olivia's stomach twisted. The stairwell had been empty - this was a blatant lie.

"Kneel," Frederick commanded.

Strong hands forced Olivia to the ground. Beatrice recorded with glee. "This will cheer Evelyn up. Justice for my baby."

"Evelyn might scar," Frederick mused. "Shall we give the mute the same mark?"

They debated her punishment like she was livestock at auction.

A sharp pain lanced through Olivia's abdomen. She pressed a protective hand over her stomach, typing frantically: "I'm pregnant!"

Beatrice's eyes gleamed. "Even better. Liam's heir will be raised by its proper mother - Evelyn."

Dark spots danced in Olivia's vision as a guard ground her face into the floor. She managed one last defiant glare at the camera before darkness threatened to consume her.

A single thought echoed as consciousness faded - her baby. She'd failed them both.

The door burst open with a crash.

"WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE?"

Olivia's fading vision caught a familiar silhouette in the doorway. Could it be...?

###Chapter 106

Daniel burst into the hospital room, his face darkening with fury when he saw Olivia collapsed on the cold tile floor.

Something had felt off all morning. Daniel had spent hours combing through Newport's surveillance network. The search was grueling, but he'd finally tracked the armed men who'd dragged Olivia to Mercy Hospital.

He was too late.

Beatrice Hartley turned with venom in her eyes, her finger shaking as she pointed at Daniel. "How dare you show your face here? You and that wretched woman destroyed my daughter's life. Now she'll pay for what she's done."

Daniel knelt, gathering Olivia's limp form with surprising tenderness. His voice cut like ice. "Our guilt—or innocence—will be decided in a courtroom, not by your hysterics. The police are already on their way. What you've done here today is criminal. Save your theatrics for the detectives."

Frederick and Beatrice exchanged panicked glances.

Daniel had barely taken three steps down the hallway when Liam appeared like a specter, flanked by a small army of Blackwood security.

Liam's expression could have frozen hell itself. "Put. Her. Down. This is between the Blackwoods and Hartleys. You're not part of this equation."

Daniel's laugh was razor-sharp. "Really? Were you too busy with Evelyn to notice Olivia nearly died today? She's always been an afterthought to you. Just because you discard people like trash doesn't mean the rest of us do."

Liam's knuckles whitened.

Sebastian Montgomery glanced at Olivia's ashen face and intervened. "Sir, she needs medical attention immediately."

With visible reluctance, Liam stepped aside.

Daniel rushed toward the ER, Olivia's shallow breaths warm against his neck. As he passed Liam, the billionaire's whisper slithered between them: "She's still my wife. No matter what happens, you'll never have her."

Daniel's grip tightened. "We'll see about that."

Sebastian watched storm clouds gather in Liam's expression. "Sir, perhaps we should—"

"Why bother?" Liam cut him off. "She called him, not me. Showing up now would just make me look like some pathetic knight in shining armor. She made her choice."

Yet despite his words, Liam found himself standing outside Evelyn's private suite, his mind churning with thoughts of Olivia.

Evelyn had been recovering well under Mercy Hospital's care, her spirits buoyed by Liam's daily visits.

Hearing the door open, she quickly schooled her features into a pained expression. "Liam, could you fetch the doctor? My head...it's like the concussion never healed."

"Enough," Liam snapped, taking the chair by her bed. "The medical report shows your only serious injury is to your hand. That forehead wound? Barely a scratch."

Evelyn batted her lashes. "But the nightmares...I keep reliving Olivia pushing me. Why would she—"

"Give me your phone."

Evelyn clutched it behind her back. "That's an invasion of privacy! We're not even—"

"Now."

With trembling fingers, she surrendered it—just as a video notification from Beatrice appeared.

The moment Liam tapped play, Beatrice's shrill voice filled the room: "Make her sign it! She'll pay for what she did to our Evelyn!"

Evelyn turned deathly pale. "Liam, I swear I didn't know—"

"Shut up."

It was the first time Evelyn had ever seen Liam truly lose control. She shrank back, her carefully constructed facade crumbling.

Liam took a steadying breath. "My mother and I have given you everything. What more do you want?"

Evelyn's gaze darted like a cornered animal's. "I don't understand—"

"Name your price." Liam's voice was steel. "Olivia remains my wife. Humiliating her humiliates me."

A calculated gleam entered Evelyn's eyes as she reached for Liam's hand. "Just two small things. A public apology admitting she's the other woman...and personal care during my recovery. That scar on my forehead—"

"Impossible." Liam jerked away. "The second demand is off the table."

Evelyn's mask slipped. "Then at least make her apologize and tend to me!"

###Chapter 107

Olivia watched Liam's retreating figure disappear down the sterile hospital corridor. The moment he turned the corner, Sebastian rushed to catch up with him.

"Mr. Blackwood, this situation remains highly uncertain. There's no concrete evidence that your wife pushed Miss Hartley. Why agree to their demands? It's completely—"

Sebastian's words died in his throat.

Though Olivia appeared delicate, she had an iron will that contradicted her fragile exterior. Learning about Liam's concession would undoubtedly ignite another explosive confrontation between them.

Liam turned, his glacial stare freezing Sebastian mid-step. "Do you have a superior alternative?"

Sebastian pressed his lips together, silent.

The crisis escalated daily. While the Hartleys lacked the influence to truly threaten Liam, their persistent agitation created complications.

Without definitive proof of Olivia's innocence, allowing the Hartley family's resentment to fester invited unpredictable consequences.

At the corridor's end, Liam paused to light a cigarette. The ember glowed as he inhaled, his expression turning arctic. "If alternatives existed, Olivia eliminated them herself. She's determined to protect Daniel at all costs. Her choice is made," he murmured, more to the night air than to Sebastian.

Sebastian opened his mouth, then reconsidered. His gaze followed Liam's departing silhouette before he swallowed his words.

In her hospital room, Olivia jolted awake in the witching hour.

Daniel remained vigil at her bedside, his sleep light. At her slightest movement, his eyes flew open.

"How are you feeling?" Concern laced Daniel's voice as he noticed Olivia's discomfort. He reached to assist her upright.

Olivia shook her head slightly, evading his touch.

She gestured that she felt improved, though exhaustion lingered. She expressed gratitude for his timely intervention but didn't wish to involve him further. Then, she insisted he return home—it was late, and she could manage alone.

Daniel's headshake was decisive. "Leaving you unprotected isn't an option. The Hartleys could return. What if they harass you after I depart?"

Olivia shook her head more vehemently, signing she could defend herself.

Anxiety twisted Olivia's features as Daniel hesitated. She nearly rose to physically usher him out.

Daniel noted her resistance, a pang of sorrow flashing across his face. "I understand your reluctance to burden others, but you must know—you're never a burden to me. I'll stand by you, always," he vowed.

Olivia's gaze flickered before she looked away.

The chair scraped. Footsteps receded.

When the door clicked shut, Olivia exhaled shakily. Guilt gnawed at her, but she saw no alternative. She recognized Daniel's feelings and cherished his kindness.

Yet reciprocation was impossible. His affection had become pressure. Knowing she couldn't give him what he wanted, the least she could do was spare him further pain.

Olivia drifted into uneasy sleep, only to startle awake when a nurse entered to adjust her IV.

She struggled upright, the IV hindering her movements. Fumbling one-handed on her phone, she made multiple errors before managing to ask about her baby's condition.

The nurse waited patiently, interpreting Olivia's distress. "Your baby's fine," she soothed. "You need rest—you're still weak. Your doctor wishes to speak when you're stronger. Visit his office when ready."

Relief flooded Olivia at her baby's safety, but the nurse's final words reignited anxiety. She nodded meekly, cradling her abdomen as emotions warred within.

After her final IV, Olivia forced down some food to regain strength.

When steadier, she followed the nurse's directions to the physician.

"Miss Sinclair?" The doctor gestured to a chair. "Please sit."

Nervous, Olivia sat and immediately typed: "Is my baby in danger?"

The doctor sighed. "You sense something's amiss."

Olivia's pulse spiked. Her phone nearly slipped as she typed frantically: "What's wrong? Please be direct!"

The physician retrieved her chart. "Your physical fragility, compounded by stress, affects the baby. Chances of a healthy birth are slim—even if the baby survives, significant weakness is likely." He paused. "You've miscarried before?"

Olivia stiffened, then nodded.

The doctor's expression sobered. "Your uterine wall is abnormally thin. Additionally..." He hesitated. "Terminating this pregnancy may prevent future conceptions given your condition."

Olivia's nails bit into her palms. Anguish and helplessness crashed over her.

Noting her pallor, the doctor softened his tone. "Discuss this thoroughly with family. This decision carries profound physical consequences."

Olivia shook her head, bitter resignation in her eyes. Her phone's mechanical voice stated: "I have no family."

The doctor blinked. "Your husband?"

Olivia's lips pressed together, too weary for explanations.

Comprehension dawned on the physician's face. "Consider carefully. I recommend hospitalization for treatment and monitoring. If agreeable, I'll arrange immediate admission."

Olivia shook her head vehemently, panic flashing. Her phone declared: "I can't stay."

The Hartleys—and Liam—haunted these halls. Remaining here was unbearable.

Recognizing her resolve, the doctor relented, prescribing medication and directing her to the pharmacy.

Heart heavy, Olivia approached the payment counter. Movement caught her eye—a familiar silhouette.

Footsteps approached. Olivia glanced up to see Liam advancing.

Her heart leapt into her throat. The prescription crumpled in her tightening grip.

He hadn't spotted her yet.

Among the hospital's bustle, Liam's commanding presence stood out.

As he neared, Olivia clenched her jaw and ducked into the emergency stairwell, descending rapidly to avoid detection.

Unseen by her, Liam witnessed the entire evasion. His mouth thinned. "Fleeing me like I'm contagion," he remarked coldly to the empty corridor.
###Chapter 108

"Am I really that terrifying?" Liam questioned.

Sebastian didn't respond, merely chuckling with an awkward edge.

After a brief silence, Sebastian proposed, "Mr. Blackwood, I noticed your wife with a medical prescription earlier. She might be unwell. Should I discreetly check on her condition? Or would you prefer I simply monitor the situation for now?"

Liam's face darkened as realization struck him. "Her health is her own concern," he dismissed coldly. "If she wants to share, she'll speak up. Otherwise, she can find another confidant."

Respecting Liam's position, Sebastian remained quiet.

Just then, a physician walked past muttering, "Such a troubling case. Pregnant yet in that condition. I strongly recommended hospitalization, but fear made her flee immediately. She clearly isn't financially constrained, so what could possibly be her reasoning?"

The doctor's voice faded down the corridor.

Liam froze mid-step upon catching the word "pregnant," his gaze snapping toward the retreating figure, his expression unreadable.

He was about to pursue the doctor when a nurse urgently intercepted. "Mr. Blackwood! Miss Hartley has collapsed! The situation appears critical—please come immediately!"

Without hesitation, Liam quickened his pace, shoving all other thoughts aside as he rushed toward the emergency.

Olivia had believed the hospital confrontation with the Hartleys marked the end of her troubles, that peace would finally return.

She couldn't have been more mistaken.

This was only the beginning.

Her home address had been leaked. Disguised reporters ambushed her on streets, demanding explanations for alleged crimes.

Footage of Olivia desperately fleeing circulated online, maliciously edited into damning compilations.

Someone even photoshopped her image onto gravestones.

"What a brilliant actress, playing the innocent victim. Who does she think she's fooling?"

"Don't you think this is excessive? She's literally disabled."

"Are you insane? Defending someone like her? Watch out—she might seduce your boyfriend next and push you down a staircase too."

"Am I the only one enjoying this? People are too soft on her. She deserves worse."

Under relentless persecution, every breath felt like a battle. Olivia had repeatedly clarified she couldn't have pushed Evelyn down the stairs that day.

But truth no longer mattered. The storm had raged too long, with the Hartleys fanning flames behind the scenes, determined to break her.

Yet Olivia remained unyielding.

Fortunately, developments offered hope. Nathaniel would return soon. Though swamped, he seemed aware of recent events. While lacking details, he'd promised to secure surveillance footage immediately upon arrival.

Meanwhile, Harrison staunchly supported Evelyn, claiming campus cameras clearly showed Olivia and Daniel pushing Evelyn—confirming cameras existed in that area.

Gathering her belongings, Olivia headed to Liam's residence.

Standing before the familiar door, her pulse raced. Who was Liam Blackwood? Even the boldest hackers would hesitate before exposing his address.

She reassured herself. They remained legally married—her return wasn't inappropriate. Besides, Liam was undoubtedly preoccupied with Evelyn at the hospital, unlikely to return soon.

She entered the passcode.

"Incorrect password."

"Incorrect password."

After multiple failed attempts, only the automated rejection echoed.

Had she misremembered the code?

Suddenly, the door swung open.

Olivia froze face-to-face with Evelyn, both equally stunned.

Evelyn recovered first, crossing her arms with a contemptuous once-over. "Well, well. Olivia Sinclair. Run out of hiding places? Hoping Liam will take you back?"

Noticing Evelyn wore casual homewear, alarm bells rang. Olivia's phone voiced her question: "Why are you here? Have you moved in?"

Evelyn's smirk was unmistakable. "Exactly. I told Liam how lonely the hospital felt, so he invited me here." Her tone dripped with satisfaction. "More convenient for my care. Understand? You're obsolete now. Just leave."

A crushing weight compressed Olivia's chest. So this explained the changed passcode. Had Liam grown that impatient? Then why delay the divorce?

"Oh, almost forgot." Evelyn vanished briefly, returning with a suitcase.

She dropped it harshly on the threshold, kicking it like trash. "Packed all your things myself. No thanks necessary."

Olivia steadied the wobbling luggage, leveling an icy glare.

Evelyn initially faltered, then bristled. "What's that look? Who do you think you're staring at?"

Olivia smirked, typing rapidly: "You're the trespasser. Henry left this house to Liam and me. I own half. We're still married—I'm staying."

Done with explanations, Olivia brushed past Evelyn, suitcase in hand.

Fate intervened as she collided with Liam descending the stairs.

Evelyn's arrogance evaporated instantly. "Liam, it hurts—"

His expression darkened at the scene. Why was Evelyn still here? He descended faster.

"What's happening?"

Evelyn clutched her side where Olivia had nudged her, eyes glistening with unshed tears—though Olivia had barely touched her.

Olivia remained impassive, setting down her bag.

As Liam passed, she caught his arm.

He stopped, turning with an unreadable expression.

Olivia signed emphatically that she meant no trouble—her apartment was currently unsafe, so she'd stay here temporarily. Regardless, she owned half the property.

"You—" Liam's brow furrowed.

She cut him off, signing she'd take the guest room, leaving him the master suite.

A flash of anger crossed his eyes. "The guest room?"

Olivia nodded. What was wrong with that? She hadn't evicted them—that was mercy enough.

Liam shook off her grip, his sneer glacial.
###Chapter 109

"Very well, I won't stand in your way," Liam murmured as he closed the distance between himself and Olivia.

His tone transformed completely when speaking to Olivia, a stark departure from his earlier harshness with Evelyn. "Does it still hurt?"

Olivia shook her head, tears glistening in her eyes. "The pain's gone. But I'm terrified. What Evelyn just did... It brought back memories of when she shoved me down those stairs."

Liam's lips curved into a protective smile. "Don't be afraid. She's restricted to the guest quarters. You're under my protection now. I won't let anyone harm you."

A flicker of hope illuminated Olivia's expression, her cheeks flushing pink as she nodded in silent gratitude.

Across the hall, Evelyn suddenly slammed her palm against the banister with enough force to make the wood shudder. Her glacial stare and sharp gestures radiated barely contained rage.

Every movement screamed her unspoken words: "Olivia, I never laid a hand on you! You know exactly how you fell. Don't think playing the victim gives you license to twist the narrative. The world may judge me now, but the truth will surface. Destroy all the evidence you want - my innocence will be proven!"

Olivia's eyelashes fluttered, her face the perfect mask of wounded confusion as she clung to Liam's sleeve. "What's she doing with all those dramatic gestures? Is she... cursing at me?"

Liam blinked in astonishment. This fiery side of Olivia was entirely new. She'd always been the picture of composure, unshakable in every circumstance.

Even during tense family gatherings with the Blackwoods, Olivia maintained her serene smile, carefully smoothing over every conflict.

A realization struck Liam. Olivia's fury wasn't solely directed at Evelyn. Her accusations included him as well.

Yet instead of anger, Liam felt an unexpected thrill seeing this passionate side of her emerge.

Turning back to Evelyn, Liam's voice turned dismissive. "Why does her opinion matter to you?"

Evelyn's lips curled in smug satisfaction, her eyes glittering with triumphant malice.

Olivia's hands trembled as bitter disappointment washed over her. Without a backward glance, she seized her luggage and marched toward the exit.

Finally alone, Liam savored the quiet before reaching for his phone. "What's the status on the investigation?"

Sebastian's voice crackled with frustration. "Westfield University claims the surveillance footage is protected under student privacy laws. They refuse to release it without proper academic affiliation."

Normally, no institution would dare defy Liam Blackwood. The Hartleys lacked the influence to orchestrate such resistance.

Liam rubbed his temples as a headache blossomed, remembering Margaret's obvious vendetta against Olivia.

Sebastian ventured carefully, "Mr. Blackwood, shall I... handle this through unofficial channels?"

A cold chuckle escaped Liam. "If intimidation worked, we wouldn't be in this mess. Monitor their movements. Nathaniel's rushing back, isn't he? He must have uncovered something to clear Olivia's name. Whether I defend her or not hardly matters now."

Sebastian fell silent, recognizing the familiar edge of jealousy in Liam's voice.

"Understood, sir," he replied.

Meanwhile, an associate questioned Sebastian's next steps regarding the media storm.

Sebastian studied the online frenzy with a critical eye. "The current buzz lacks teeth. Since the Hartleys are known for deploying internet trolls, perhaps we should adopt similar tactics."

The associate frowned. "You mean hire trolls to defend Mrs. Blackwood?"

Sebastian's lips curved into a sly smile. "Not exactly. We're simply going to... amplify the conversation. Things only get interesting when the pot starts boiling."

His team exchanged puzzled glances. As Liam's right-hand man, Sebastian's words carried the weight of his employer's intentions.

The assistants whispered among themselves:

"I think Mr. Blackwood has truly abandoned that poor girl."

"Seems likely. With his status, he'd want a socially polished partner. It's embarrassing bringing someone who can't speak to elite events."

"I wonder how long until the divorce. It's maddening seeing her live better than us."

"Careful - she might push you down the stairs if she overhears."

Cruel laughter rippled through the group. To them, Olivia remained an enigma - someone they'd never truly engaged with, yet felt entitled to mock without consequence.

Amidst the turmoil, an unexpected invitation arrived for Olivia.

She examined the embossed card with suspicion, gesturing to confirm its authenticity.

The maid nodded respectfully. "Yes, madam. The courier hasn't departed yet. Shall I recall him if you doubt its legitimacy?"

Olivia shook her head decisively, her fingers tracing the elegant calligraphy as unease coiled in her stomach.

The maid, who'd previously benefited from Olivia's kindness, felt compelled to warn her. "Madam, I'd advise against attending. Given current circumstances... this may be designed to humiliate you."

Olivia responded with a gentle but firm smile. Precisely because of the scandal, she needed to appear. She believed in her innocence - hiding would only fuel speculation. Staying home might be interpreted as admission of guilt.

The maid persisted. "Should I inform Mr. Blackwood? His presence could deter any unpleasantness."

Olivia paused thoughtfully before signing a question about the invitation distribution.

The maid's expression darkened. "Three were delivered. Miss Hartley and Mr. Blackwood received theirs as well."

Olivia's smile turned wry. Then there was no need to involve Liam. She'd count herself fortunate if he didn't publicly side with Evelyn against her. Expecting his defense was pure fantasy.

As Olivia departed with the invitation, the maid released a quiet sigh of resignation.

While outsiders misunderstood Olivia, the staff recognized her true nature. Kindhearted by disposition, her silence made her an easy target. Yet she never took her frustrations out on the household. Her compassion had touched many lives within these walls.

Consequently, the entire staff resented Evelyn's temporary residence.

Lately, Evelyn had grown increasingly comfortable in Liam's home, reveling in the situation. The only obstacle remained Olivia's refusal to leave.

Evelyn had made multiple attempts to lure Liam into prolonged stays in her bedroom.

Yet Liam resisted, even erupting when Evelyn tampered with Olivia's belongings.

Evelyn couldn't comprehend it. In her mind, she and Liam were star-crossed lovers torn apart by Olivia's interference.
###Chapter 110

The afternoon sunlight streamed through the windows of the Blackwood mansion, casting long shadows across the polished floors. In Evelyn Hartley's twisted perception, Olivia Sinclair was the homewrecker, not herself. She quickly justified Liam's actions in her mind. Their marriage had been arranged by the Winslow family, after all. Even with Henry Winslow gone, such defiance would surely anger the remaining family elders.

Evelyn's fingers tightened around the embossed invitation, her lips curling into a vicious smile. This was her moment. She would use this gala to show Olivia the insurmountable divide between her and Liam. No matter what, Evelyn believed she alone deserved the Blackwood heir.

Storming to the walk-in closet, Evelyn yanked Olivia's designer dresses from their hangers, letting them pool on the marble floor like discarded rags. "Remove this trash immediately," she commanded a passing maid. "And summon an interior designer first thing tomorrow. I can't stand this outdated decor another day!"

Beatrice Whitmore, the head housekeeper, stepped forward with practiced calm. "Miss Hartley, I'll need Mr. Blackwood's authorization for such changes. These garments belong to Mrs. Blackwood. Their disposal requires her consent."

The deliberate emphasis on "Mrs. Blackwood" made Evelyn's face contort with rage.

A sharp crack echoed through the bedroom as Evelyn's palm connected with Beatrice's cheek. The older woman staggered back, her face already blooming red.

"You forget your place," Beatrice said evenly, cradling her injured face. "This is the Blackwood estate, not your family's property."

Liam might be distant, but he treated staff with basic respect. They were well-compensated professionals, not punching bags for spoiled heiresses.

Evelyn laughed mockingly. "Soon enough, this will be my household to command. Cross me now, and you'll be the first one I fire when I'm lady of the house." Her voice dripped venom. "Run crying to that pathetic mute if you like. She can't even speak for herself, let alone defend you."

Beatrice stood her ground. "My employment terms require Mr. or Mrs. Blackwood's approval for termination. Unless you have that, these items stay."

Each "Mrs. Blackwood" struck Evelyn like a physical blow. Enraged, she grabbed Beatrice's arm and dragged her toward the grand staircase. "Consider yourself fired! Get out!"

At that moment, Olivia appeared at the top of the stairs, having heard the commotion. Beatrice teetered dangerously at the landing's edge.

Seeing the opportunity, Evelyn didn't just release her grip—she gave a calculated shove.

The housekeeper tumbled down the marble steps with a cry that turned Olivia's blood to ice.

Evelyn's face morphed into theatrical shock, hands flying to her mouth. "She just collapsed! It was an accident!"

Olivia ignored the performance, rushing to Beatrice's side. Her skilled fingers flew in urgent signs: Are you hurt? Can you stand?

Though bruised and shaken, Beatrice managed a weak smile. "Just my pride, ma'am."

"What's happening here?" Liam's voice cut through the tension like a blade.

Evelyn transformed instantly, throwing herself against Liam's chest with practiced sobs. "That maid fell right in front of me! After what Olivia did to me on these stairs... it triggered my trauma!" Her entire body trembled with manufactured panic.

Liam gently disentangled himself, his stormy gaze shifting between the women. "Explain."

Olivia moved first, signing rapidly with fierce precision. Evelyn pushed her. I saw everything.

"You lying bitch!" Evelyn abandoned her fragile act, rounding on Olivia. "She slipped! You're just trying to turn Liam against me!"

Liam's expression darkened as he studied Beatrice's injuries. "You have one chance to tell me exactly what happened."

Beatrice wiped her bleeding lip. "Miss Hartley demanded we redecorate the master suite. When I said that required your approval, she struck me. Then she dragged me to the stairs and..." Her voice broke. "Your grandfather hired me thirty years ago, sir. I was following household protocol."

Evelyn's eyes welled with crocodile tears. "Liam, you know me! I may be spoiled, but I'd never resort to violence. Olivia's been trying to destroy me since day one—first my face, now my reputation!"

The air thickened with tension as Liam's jaw tightened. He turned to Beatrice. "Security cameras cover every inch of this hallway. Shall we review the footage, or will someone start telling the truth?"
###Chapter 111

Beatrice Whitmore trembled, her fear of Liam Blackwood's imposing presence palpable. She flushed at Evelyn Hartley's smug expression, ready to speak, but before she could, Olivia Sinclair stepped in front of her, gesturing firmly that she had witnessed Beatrice being pushed down.

The scene had been chaotic, and those involved might not have realized what truly occurred. Olivia added that she'd seen Evelyn and Beatrice arguing on the stairs moments before Beatrice tumbled down.

Liam's face twisted into a frown, disapproval etching his features. "So you're not even certain what happened, yet you immediately concluded Evelyn pushed her? Olivia, since when do you jump to conclusions?"

Evelyn blinked, the picture of wounded innocence as she clung to Liam's arm. "Liam, without your intervention, I would've been falsely accused today. I've already suffered enough humiliation in front of Olivia. What more does she want from me?"

Liam ignored Evelyn, his icy gaze locked with Olivia's. Olivia lifted her chin defiantly, meeting his stare without flinching. She deliberately avoided using sign language, choosing instead to let her phone's text-to-speech function articulate her response for Evelyn's benefit: "I did this intentionally. I wanted to make a point. Now you see - not everything you hear is true. Evelyn was quick to accuse Daniel and me of pushing her down, and you believed it without question. Why then, when Beatrice and I accuse Evelyn, do you hesitate?"

Understanding dawned in Liam's eyes. Evelyn's smile slowly faded. Visibly irritated, she muttered, "This isn't the same situation."

Despite her words, Evelyn studied Liam's face anxiously. She hadn't anticipated this response from him.

Liam stated coldly, "Having known Evelyn for years, I can recognize when she's being dishonest. There was no need for such a crude demonstration."

Olivia's face paled. Was this what trust looked like? Had he ever trusted her that completely? She immediately dismissed the thought as ridiculous.

Olivia retorted through her phone: "Beatrice didn't simply fall down those stairs. Neither of us would stage such an accident. You should be questioning Evelyn about what really happened. She's been targeting Beatrice because of me."

She gestured pointedly toward the vivid bruise marring Beatrice's left cheek.

Liam's lips tightened, his expression indifferent. "Call the family physician," he instructed dismissively.

Olivia held his gaze for a long moment before turning wordlessly to leave.

Evelyn felt some tension ease from her shoulders. She shot Beatrice a venomous look. "Why am I being blamed for this? Beatrice has been taunting me relentlessly with her snide remarks. I wonder who's putting her up to it. Liam, why do you tolerate such behavior? Someone like her should be dismissed immediately. And as for Olivia... I dread to think what might happen if she remains in this house. Perhaps—"

Evelyn looked at Liam expectantly.

Liam offered a chilling smile, his gaze sharp and calculating. "Perhaps I should remove Olivia immediately so you can take her place as lady of the house, is that it?"

That was precisely Evelyn's hope, though she'd never admit it outright. She merely pouted. "Liam, what are you implying? I only want what's best for you."

Liam's expression hardened. "I'm capable of making my own decisions. Beatrice was hired by Henry Winslow and isn't someone I can simply dismiss. If you can't tolerate her presence, stay away from her."

Evelyn's eyes widened in disbelief. Being forced to endure a servant's presence was unacceptable. Anger threatened to overwhelm her, but she forced it down. With a hollow laugh, she conceded, "Very well. I don't want to cause trouble. I'll... tolerate her."

She hoped her show of martyrdom might earn some sympathy.

Seizing the moment, Evelyn made her plea. "Liam, I was truly frightened today. Would you stay with me tonight? I don't ask for anything... just having you nearby would make me feel safe."

Liam gave her a brief, unreadable look before turning away without response.

Evelyn watched his retreating figure, her teeth clenched in frustration.

After Beatrice recovered from her injuries, she grew closer to Olivia. This shift didn't go unnoticed by the other staff in the Blackwood estate, who became more willing to engage with Olivia. Evelyn found herself increasingly isolated.

One afternoon, noticing Olivia deep in thought, Beatrice approached quietly. "Olivia?"

Olivia looked up and quickly signed, inquiring about Beatrice's recovery and whether she experienced any discomfort.

Beatrice smiled reassuringly. "Much better now. Mr. Blackwood arranged for an excellent physician. He said if any discomfort persists, he'll take me to Mercy Hospital personally."

Olivia nodded, then gestured that she preferred to be called by her first name rather than "Madam."

Beatrice hesitated before speaking carefully. "I don't believe Mr. Blackwood is as indifferent as he appears. For the record, I wasn't hired by Henry Winslow. If Mr. Blackwood truly cared for Evelyn, he would have dismissed me already. I believe he still respects your feelings. In his eyes, you remain his lawful wife, while Evelyn is merely an intruder. Perhaps when he tires of her, things will return to normal."

Olivia's expression darkened as she absorbed these words. Though unable to voice her thoughts, her gestures conveyed her resolve clearly. She signed emphatically that she refused to be merely one woman among many competing for Liam's attention. In a world that claimed to value equality, she couldn't comprehend why she, as his wife, should have to fight for his affection. The injustice of it rankled.

Olivia had never before confronted the inherent imbalance in their relationship.

Recognizing her distress, Beatrice quickly changed the subject. "I heard you're attending the upcoming gala. I did some research for you. It's Miss Ellington's birthday celebration. Her family may not be wealthy, but they've been prominent in education for generations and command considerable respect. Miss Ellington herself is known for her integrity, so you shouldn't encounter any difficulties. You can attend with confidence."

Olivia managed a small smile. This was indeed good news. Yet the thought of Evelyn and Liam attending together soured her mood. Still, she felt powerless to change the situation. She'd done nothing wrong and refused to hide. Avoiding them would only give Evelyn ammunition for rumors.

"Olivia!" A sharp feminine voice cut through the air.

Turning, Olivia saw Evelyn approaching, her elegant stride belying the determination in her eyes.
###Chapter 112

Olivia didn't even attempt to hide the cold disdain in her expression.

"Don't glare at me like that." Evelyn's lips curled into a smirk as she dangled a designer shopping bag. "Liam was free this afternoon, so he took me shopping. We picked out this little something for you together."

The silent woman simply stared at her rival without blinking.

Beatrice immediately positioned herself protectively in front of Olivia. "Miss Hartley, if you value your peace, I suggest you stop provoking trouble. Your mere presence here is disgraceful enough without openly challenging the mistress of this house."

Evelyn let out a derisive laugh. "Mistress? Does Olivia truly believe she holds that title? Liam would laugh at the notion. This is the Blackwood estate. What right do you have to speak?"

"You—" Beatrice's face flushed with anger.

Olivia calmly took the gift bag from Evelyn's hands. Inside lay an outdated dress that might have been fashionable decades ago, though it bore some craftsmanship.

She couldn't comprehend Evelyn's motives for this insulting gesture. Without hesitation, Olivia tossed it straight into the nearby wastebasket.

Evelyn's smirk only widened. "I warned you. This was Liam's choice, and you've just thrown his gift away like trash."

Olivia remained silent, meeting Evelyn's gaze steadily as she typed on her phone:

"We need to talk."

Evelyn's lips pursed momentarily, but she didn't refuse. She clearly relished any opportunity to assert dominance over Olivia.

As Beatrice exited to give them privacy, Evelyn perched on an armchair, chin lifted arrogantly. "Make it quick. Liam's taking me to that new French bistro tonight."

Olivia bowed her head slightly, shoulders slumping in apparent defeat as her fingers moved across the phone screen:

"I swear I'll leave Liam. The divorce papers are being prepared. Just leave me alone."

Evelyn's expression twisted strangely. "Leave you alone? Darling, that's my line. That day was absolutely terrifying—I never want to experience anything like it again." Her theatrical shudder didn't match the cold calculation in her eyes.

Olivia's grip on the phone tightened, knuckles whitening. She kept her gaze lowered to hide the fire burning behind her composed facade. The words on her screen were razor-sharp:

"You know I didn't push you. This isn't about that stair incident or what happened to Beatrice. None of it matters now. If you and the Hartleys stop hounding me, I'll disappear from Liam's life forever. Isn't that what you've always wanted?"

Evelyn stood abruptly and closed the distance between them. Seeing Olivia's bowed head filled her with vicious satisfaction.

She tsked mockingly. "How pathetic you've become, Olivia. You're right—I have no intention of making this easy for you. Truth is irrelevant. The entire social circle backs my version. Even your husband stands with me. Who cares about facts when perception is everything?"

Her manicured nails dug into Olivia's chin, leaving angry red marks on the pale skin. Tears welled in Olivia's eyes, but she stubbornly refused to let them fall.

Evelyn's smile turned cruel. "You brought this on yourself by manipulating Liam into marriage with Henry's help. That should have been my ring, my title. You stole my future, and for that, you'll pay."

She released Olivia's face with a rough shove. "Honestly, I nearly pushed you that day. Pity you reacted too quickly. But it changes nothing. Liam will always choose me. Had you fallen, no one would have questioned it." Her laugh was icy. "If I were as pitiful as you, I'd never show my face again."

Olivia straightened suddenly, all traces of vulnerability gone. Her glacial stare seemed to say: Push me too far, Evelyn, and we'll both burn.

Evelyn's phone buzzed unexpectedly. She deliberately angled the screen to show Liam's caller ID.

"Look at this, Olivia. When did Liam last call you?" Her voice dripped with malice. "Oh wait—you can't hold conversations, can you? Did you know after every night with you, he'd spend hours talking to me? Everything you failed to give him, I provided. Since you insist on clinging to that wedding ring, don't blame me for being merciless."

With a triumphant smile, she answered the call and strutted away, leaving Olivia standing frozen.

At the restaurant, Evelyn's heart leaped seeing Liam waiting alone in the private dining room. Lately, he'd always brought Sebastian along, maintaining careful distance between them.

Perhaps he'd finally come to his senses.

Instead of sitting across from him, Evelyn slid into the adjacent chair, pressing close. "Liam, what's the occasion for this intimate dinner?"

"Maintain proper decorum." His voice was arctic.

Evelyn pouted dramatically. "Since when do you mind me sitting close? Don't tell me you've developed feelings for that mute—"

Liam's silence made her stomach drop. A fleeting image of Olivia's detached expression crossed his mind—when had the woman who once adored him become so distant?

To avoid further conversation, Liam pulled out his phone and showed Evelyn a video. He didn't need to play it—the thumbnail alone drained the color from her face. Her hands clenched into fists, all words failing her.
###Chapter 113

"Liam, where did you get this?" Evelyn gasped.

Liam gave Evelyn a bone-chilling stare. "I've warned you before—when I decide to uncover the truth, there are endless ways to do it. This shouldn't surprise you, should it?"

Evelyn's throat tightened. She bit her lip hard enough to draw blood, frustration boiling inside her.

Nothing stayed hidden from Liam when he went digging. She had foolishly believed he trusted her enough not to investigate. Yet here he stood, having uncovered everything without her even noticing.

Clutching at straws, Evelyn confessed, "The fact that you're telling me this instead of exposing me publicly means you don't want to hurt me. Yes, I framed Olivia deliberately. I loathe her! Why does she get to stand by your side? It should be me!"

Liam slid his phone back into his pocket, his voice glacial. "Regardless, my relationship with Olivia is none of your concern. I don't know what delusion made you think you ever stood a chance. Let me make this clear—no one forces me into anything against my will."

The realization hit Evelyn like a physical blow, draining the color from her face. His marriage to Olivia had been his choice alone. But how could this be?

To Evelyn, Olivia was just a worthless mute—completely unworthy of Liam. Yet now she had to face the unbearable truth: Liam had genuine feelings for Olivia. The mere thought made her vision swim with rage.

Liam's cutting words continued to echo. "I'm keeping this quiet out of respect for the Hartley family's reputation. Do you understand?"

The sound of the door slamming shattered Evelyn's composure. Her legs gave way as she collapsed against the table, bitter despair flooding through her. Despite biting her lip until it bled, hot tears streamed down her face uncontrollably.

"No..." Evelyn rasped, her nails digging into the table's edge. "I won't accept this!"

Reconciliation was impossible. Liam belonged to her. She refused to surrender him. If his affections had strayed, she'd simply reel him back in.

Outside, the storm intensified, lightning splitting the sky.

Sebastian arrived with an umbrella to collect Liam.

As icy wind lashed at them, Liam was seized by a violent coughing fit.

"Mr. Blackwood," Sebastian fretted, "you must take better care of yourself. Pushing your limits like this—"

Liam waved him off, catching his breath. Settling into the car, he leaned back with a weary sigh, swallowing with visible difficulty. "Most problems are handled now. There's little left to worry about."

Sebastian sighed. "You're still concerned about your wife, even if she doesn't realize it. Perhaps it's time you spoke honestly with her."

Liam gave a bitter chuckle. "What's there to discuss? She wants a divorce. Everything I've done wasn't just for her. As the adopted daughter of the Blackwoods, she's been family for years. My actions were merely... compassionate."

Sebastian remained silent, contemplating the stubbornness both Liam and Olivia shared.

After a pause, Sebastian ventured, "With this evidence, why not dismantle the Hartleys? They manipulated you, turned you against your wife. Their behavior is despicable."

Liam smirked. "Did I ever say I believed them? As for holding back..." His voice trailed off meaningfully.

Sebastian's eyes widened in understanding. "You're worried pushing them too far might endanger Olivia."

"Actually, no," Liam corrected lightly. "I'm avoiding unnecessary complications. I'll resolve this cleanly, then step away. Olivia can handle her own affairs from then on. I'm done."

Though Sebastian doubted Liam's resolve, he chose not to argue. Starting the car, he drove in silence.

Meanwhile, Olivia jolted awake as thunder shook the manor. She tossed restlessly, pulling the covers over her head. No matter how old she grew, thunderstorms still terrified her—a fear tied to some half-remembered trauma that brought splitting headaches whenever she tried recalling it.

As the storm raged, Olivia curled into a tight ball, squeezing her eyes shut as fragmented memories surfaced.

She remembered trailing after Liam as a child. During storms, she'd sneak into his room despite his feigned annoyance. He'd call her shameless for clinging to him so tightly, but never actually pushed her away.

Olivia couldn't pinpoint when her feelings for Liam had changed. Maybe when she noticed how even the strongest Reeves child could look so lonely. Maybe it was the kindness hidden beneath his stern exterior. Or perhaps all those times he'd stood up for her.

Whatever the reason, their relationship was doomed to remain platonic—bound by kinship or friendship. Yet her treacherous heart had led her to cross lines.

Now that they were practically strangers, perhaps this distance was for the best.

Olivia opened her eyes, startled by the wetness on her cheeks. She hadn't realized she was crying. Struggling upright, she froze when the door suddenly opened.

Her breath caught at the shadowed figure in the doorway. Even in darkness, she'd recognize Liam anywhere. They remained motionless, the air between them charged with unspoken words.

Time stretched as neither moved.

Almost against her will, Olivia's hand lifted—only to freeze when Evelyn's saccharine voice called out.

"Liam..." Evelyn's voice dripped with a honeyed charm Olivia could never mimic.

Liam turned immediately, leaving without a backward glance.

Once he disappeared, Olivia slipped from bed, padding barefoot to where he'd stood. There, she found earplugs. Her heart leapt—had he left them for her?

On impulse, she yanked the door open to thank him—only to freeze at the sight before her.

Liam and Evelyn stood dangerously close, their bodies angled in unmistakable intimacy.

A wave of crushing disappointment washed over Olivia. Silently chastising her foolish hope, she shut the door quietly, leaving the earplugs untouched—as if ignoring them could erase what she'd seen.

Evelyn clung to Liam's hand pleadingly. "I know framing Olivia was wrong, but I've paid dearly. See?" She pushed her bangs aside, revealing an ugly scar. "This permanent reminder..."

###Chapter 114

Olivia's scar had mostly faded, but the angry red mark still marred her porcelain skin. She used to hate bangs, considering them childish. Now they became her shield - hiding the ugly reminder of her humiliation. The mirror reflected a wounded pride that festered beneath her carefully constructed composure.

"I've suffered enough while Evelyn walked away unscathed. I swear I won't bother her again, so please... don't hate me," Olivia whispered, her voice trembling with suppressed emotion.

Liam studied her face - the mix of vulnerability and resentment twisting her delicate features. His response came sharp as a blade. "This was never about Evelyn. You had no business targeting her. I warned you to stop before things escalated. Did you honestly believe I'd approve of your petty schemes?"

Olivia flinched, words catching in her throat. Yet she pressed forward with desperate determination. "I saw you declined Victoria Ellington's invitation. She's my close friend, you know. And now you're avoiding all her events?" Her voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. "Let's be honest - you and Evelyn won't last. Why not give us a chance when it ends?"

Ice crystallized in Liam's gaze. "There is no 'us.' Stop these delusions, Olivia, or I'll expedite our professional separation."

As Liam turned to leave, Olivia's composure shattered. "What about all those times?" Her voice cracked. "You always chose me over her! Don't pretend there wasn't something between us!"

Liam didn't break stride.

Then realization struck Olivia like lightning. A bitter smile curved her lips even as tears streaked her makeup. "I understand now," she murmured to the empty room. "You were only using me to make Evelyn jealous, weren't you?"

The truth settled like shards of glass in her chest. Every glance, every favor - all calculated moves in some twisted game. But why? She loved Liam more deeply than that wretched Evelyn ever could.

Olivia scanned the hallway, but Liam had vanished. Only the bitter taste of betrayal remained. She cursed them both for pushing her to this desperate edge.

The media storm had quieted like last night's thunder - deafening in the moment, but gone without trace by morning.

Today was the gala. Olivia noticed the rumors about her supposedly pushing someone down the stairs had mysteriously disappeared. At first it puzzled her, then the answer became obvious - Liam wanted to avoid scandal before Victoria's prestigious event.

Not that she needed his help. She could have cleared her name perfectly well alone. Tonight marked her triumphant return. With Nathaniel Bradford's surveillance footage, her reputation would be restored.

Downstairs, Evelyn was packing, apparently preparing to leave. Olivia found this odd but didn't inquire. Couples fought - whatever issues Evelyn had with Liam weren't her concern. After dressing, Olivia descended to find Evelyn still in the foyer.

Evelyn was directing servants to load luggage into waiting cars. Spotting Olivia, she approached with a smile that didn't reach her cold eyes. Despite the pleasant expression, Olivia always sensed venom beneath Evelyn's polished surface.

Instinctively, Olivia took a step back, maintaining distance.

"Off to the Ellingtons', are we?" Evelyn chirped. "Why don't we ride together?"

Olivia shook her head, her expression frosty. With a mocking curtsy, she signed that she preferred traveling alone.

Evelyn's smile tightened. "Let's hope you don't regret that choice later." Her gaze dropped to the gift box in Olivia's hands. "Is that for Victoria? You should know she has... particular tastes. Perhaps something less... common would be more appropriate."

Olivia responded with an exaggerated sign of gratitude, her eyes sparkling with sarcasm.

"And the outfit I selected for you?" Evelyn pressed. "A bit dated, I admit, but it suited your... aesthetic."

Olivia pointed to the trash bin near the door where the discarded garments lay.

For a fleeting moment, Evelyn's mask slipped. With a disdainful sniff, she whirled away in a swirl of expensive perfume.

Liam had no intention of attending tonight. Evelyn had commandeered every available vehicle in some dramatic power play. The pettiness was almost impressive.

Olivia saw through Evelyn's charade. The woman lived to humiliate her. A taxi seemed the simplest solution - or so she thought.

Despite Beatrice Whitmore's assurances about Victoria's character, Olivia suspected tonight wouldn't be straightforward. Her instincts proved correct the moment she reached the venue.

The doorman examined her invitation with growing suspicion. "I'm afraid this is counterfeit," he announced loudly enough for nearby guests to hear. "It lacks Madam Ellington's official seal. You'll need to verify this directly with her if you wish to enter."

Murmurs rippled through the crowd.

"How embarrassing," someone tittered.

"Isn't she the Winslow family's ward? The one involved in that scandal with Miss Hartley?" another whispered.

"Apparently caught with her lover by Miss Hartley," a third voice added, not bothering to lower their volume.

"She looks so innocent, but that's clearly an act."

"Rumor has it she trapped Liam Blackwood into marriage with Henry Winslow pulling strings."

"Her story was everywhere, then suddenly vanished. Must be her lover's doing."

"And now she crashes Madam Ellington's gala with a fake invitation? Pathetic."

The cruel whispers swirled around Olivia like a toxic fog. Her knuckles whitened around her clutch.

Olivia pieced together what happened. Three invitations had arrived together, with Beatrice handling distribution. Beatrice wouldn't deliberately give her a fake - she couldn't distinguish real from forged.

Only one explanation remained: all invitations were counterfeit. No matter which Beatrice gave her, humiliation was inevitable.

But questions lingered. How had Evelyn entered so effortlessly? Did Liam know about the fake invitation, explaining his absence? It seemed both had known this trap awaited her.

Evelyn's motives were transparent - another attempt to embarrass her. But Liam's silence? That cut deeper than Olivia dared examine.
###Chapter 115

Olivia Sinclair quickly composed herself and pulled out her phone, typing a message to show the waiter. Her fingers trembled slightly as she tried to explain that the invitation had genuinely come from Victoria Ellington and there must have been some mistake.

The waiter's mocking laughter echoed through the grand hall, dripping with contempt. "Oh really? So you're claiming Miss Ellington personally arranged this elaborate prank just for you?" His voice carried across the room, drawing curious glances.

Whispers spread like wildfire among the gathered guests.

"Impossible. Victoria is far too gracious for such pettiness," one socialite murmured behind her champagne glass.

"Looks like someone's trying to shift blame for their own mistake," another guest added with a disdainful sniff.

A cold realization washed over Olivia. This felt like a carefully orchestrated trap. But why would Victoria target her? They'd never even exchanged words before.

"Would someone care to explain this commotion?" A crisp, commanding voice cut through the murmurs like a knife.

All heads turned toward the elegant figure making her entrance.

Dressed in an ice-blue couture gown that shimmered with every step, Victoria Ellington carried herself with effortless authority. Her sharp eyes scanned the room before landing on Olivia, her expression hardening as she took in the scene.

One of the guests immediately stepped forward to recount the situation.

As the explanation unfolded, Victoria's lips pressed into a thin line. She approached Olivia with measured steps. "Miss Sinclair," she began, her voice cool, "I'll be frank. Your recent... exploits have left a rather unpleasant impression. But even so, I would never resort to such childish games. Perhaps you should examine your own actions before casting accusations."

Olivia's throat tightened. She hurriedly typed out a response. "Miss Ellington, there's clearly been a misunderstanding. I've never spoken against you. I'd appreciate the chance to clear this up."

"Enough!" Victoria snapped, turning briefly to address the smirking waiter. "Regardless of invitations, we don't turn guests away at the door. Show her in."

Olivia's fists clenched at her sides. The injustice burned - being denied even the basic dignity of defending herself.

The waiter gave Olivia a patronizing look before rolling his eyes dramatically.

Shaking her head, Olivia made no move to enter. Without a proper invitation, it would be beyond inappropriate.

Victoria misinterpreted Olivia's hesitation. "What now? Playing the victim?" she asked with a mocking tilt of her head. "Expecting me to grovel? That pitiful expression doesn't suit you - it makes me look like the villain here."

Overwhelmed, Olivia shook her head vehemently, abandoning her phone to sign rapidly. Her hands moved with desperate clarity - she wasn't blaming anyone, just seeking understanding.

A derisive snort came from the crowd. "Who here understands sign language? For all we know, she could be insulting Victoria right now."

"Wouldn't surprise me. That one's got a nasty streak. Honestly, Victoria's being too generous letting her stay. I'd have security escort her out."

"Don't trouble yourself, Victoria. We all saw what happened. You've done nothing wrong. If she's upset, that's her problem."

The realization hit Olivia like a physical blow. Prejudice was an immovable mountain. The online rumors might have died down, but their judgment was set in stone. No amount of truth could shift it now.

A quiet sigh escaped Olivia's lips as she blinked back the sting in her eyes.

Victoria caught the subtle change in Olivia's expression. Her posture softened slightly. "Let's put this behind us. Today's meant for celebration, not drama. Whether she chooses to stay or leave is her decision."

Despite the conciliatory words, the disdain in Victoria's eyes remained.

The collective scorn from the crowd pressed in on Olivia like a tidal wave, leaving her stranded on an island of isolation with no hope of escape.

Then, like a lifeline, a familiar presence cut through the tension.

Gregory Thornton approached with his characteristic warm smile, positioning himself protectively beside Olivia.

"Gregory!" Victoria's face lit up with genuine pleasure. "I didn't think you'd come!"

Gregory typed out his reply. "Your grandfather and I go way back. How could I miss his favorite granddaughter's birthday celebration?"

After exchanging pleasantries, Gregory's attention turned to Olivia. His next message was clearly in her defense. "I couldn't help but notice some tension earlier. Olivia may be quiet, but she's one of the kindest souls I know. There must be some misunderstanding here."

Victoria's smile dimmed slightly, though she didn't challenge Gregory directly. "You rarely speak so highly of anyone. If you vouch for her character, I'll take your word for it. But let's set this aside for now - Grandfather's been asking after you all evening."

Gregory nodded amiably before gesturing for Olivia to accompany him inside.

With Gregory's endorsement, the crowd's hostility dissipated like morning fog.

Olivia's eyes shone with unshed tears as she followed Gregory into the ballroom. Once they had relative privacy, her fingers flew across her phone. "Thank you, but you shouldn't have done that. It might reflect poorly on you."

Gregory's responding smile was gentle as he typed back. "At my age, reputation matters little. You're my protégé - defending you is both my privilege and responsibility."

The simple sincerity brought a lump to Olivia's throat. Her reply was equally heartfelt. "Your belief in me means everything."

Gregory sighed softly before sharing another thought. "Victoria's fundamentally good-hearted. She's likely heard too many distorted stories about you. Spend some time with her - let her see the real you."

Olivia nodded in quiet agreement.

Then Gregory revealed something unexpected. "She once asked to apprentice under me. I declined, saying I'd already chosen my student."

Olivia's brow furrowed in confusion. From what little she knew, Victoria seemed exceptionally bright. Wouldn't her intellect be an asset in their specialized field?

Gregory shook his head knowingly. His next message held wisdom born of experience. "Raw talent isn't everything. Victoria's impatient by nature - a fatal flaw in our work. You possess the rarest qualities: patience, focus, and an unshakable dedication to truth."

A faint blush colored Olivia's cheeks as she typed her humble response. "You honor me."
###Chapter 116

Two figures watched the tense exchange between Gregory and Olivia from a distance. Victoria Ellington's face was a canvas of conflicting emotions—irritation blended with reluctant distress.

Just then, Evelyn Hartley glided over, placing a comforting hand on Victoria's shoulder. "Olivia truly is a master manipulator, isn't she? She's perfected the art of deception. Everyone who crosses her path falls victim to her schemes. No matter what happens, she always emerges unscathed."

Evelyn's voice trembled as tears welled in her eyes. "See this scar? It's permanent. But what could I do? She blackmailed my parents by threatening self-harm, and she wouldn't leave Liam alone. They had no choice but to protect her, pretending everything was fine."

Victoria's fists clenched at her sides. "I knew she was cunning, but this level of cruelty..."

A smirk flickered across Evelyn's face before she quickly schooled her features. "We were powerless. She always plays the victim. In this world, the most pitiful often receive the most sympathy."

Victoria met Evelyn's gaze squarely. "Don't worry. I won't let her get away with this. Women like her disgust me."

Evelyn's poisonous words continued fueling Victoria's rage.

"I remember how you once wanted to apprentice under Gregory. I never understood why he refused until I discovered Olivia's interference. She—"

Victoria cut her off sharply, her brow furrowed in displeasure. "Enough. This is my battle. Even if that woman overstepped, I won't blame everything on her."

Evelyn gave an awkward chuckle. "Of course, you're absolutely right."

The banquet hall hummed with conversation, many guests not bothering to lower their voices as they judged Olivia. She reminded herself why she'd come tonight, steeling herself against their stares. But Nathaniel Bradford's sudden appearance caught her off guard.

Nathaniel approached swiftly, his voice thick with remorse. "Olivia, I'm so sorry. I invited you to that exhibition with good intentions, never imagining it would cause you such distress. The full surveillance footage from the university will be ready soon—it'll clear your name completely. Should I release it immediately?"

Olivia shook her head, typing rapidly on her phone. "Thank you for believing in me. But aren't you worried? What if I really was the instigator?"

Nathaniel smiled warmly. "If I thought you capable of such things, I'd never have invited you. Rumors spread like wildfire, and people swallow them whole. As for Harrison, once this settles, I'll ensure he's fired and issues you a public apology."

Warmth flooded Olivia's chest as she typed firmly: "Let's not act hastily. I came tonight to confirm my suspicions. Now I see Evelyn deliberately lured me here to humiliate me—but I won't go down without a fight."

Her icy gaze found Evelyn across the room. At that precise moment, Evelyn met her stare, lips curling into a sneer as she silently mouthed an insult.

Rather than react, Olivia offered a composed smile.

When gift presentations began, Olivia offered something tasteful yet understated—appropriate given her distant relationship with Victoria.

Victoria barely glanced at it before waving a servant away, her dismissiveness bordering on contempt.

Evelyn's lips twitched in satisfaction.

As Olivia turned to leave, Evelyn's voice rang out: "Olivia, wait!"

Olivia's instincts prickled. She turned calmly to face Evelyn, who wore an expression of feigned distress.

"It's probably nothing, but I just remembered something important." Evelyn turned to Victoria. "Remember those missing items of your mother's?"

Victoria nodded cautiously. "Yes, but why bring that up now?"

Evelyn continued smoothly, "Well, at the vintage shop recently, I found two exquisite dresses—clearly valuable heirlooms. I bought them for Olivia. Today, seeing your mother's photos, I realized—those were her missing pieces."

Victoria stood abruptly, face paling. "Are you certain? Could you be mistaken?"

Evelyn shook her head emphatically. "No mistake. I recognized their quality immediately and took photos." She produced her phone eagerly.

Victoria's eyes welled instantly. Even years later, anything connected to her late mother undid her completely. "You gave these to Olivia?" she asked hoarsely.

Evelyn struggled to hide her triumph. "Yes, but she dismissed them as trash. Perhaps she lacks appreciation for vintage pieces. Or maybe her hatred for me taints everything I offer."

Victoria absorbed this silently before turning to Olivia, eyes brimming with sorrow. "Despite our differences, I'll pay any price for those items. They're my mother's. I don't know how they went missing, but I beg you to return them."

Olivia's breath hitched, discomfort flashing across her features.

Seizing the moment, Evelyn interjected loudly: "Olivia, please tell me you didn't discard them! Those were Miss Ellington's mother's belongings! How could you be so heartless?"

Olivia clenched her fists, maintaining composure. She'd suspected Evelyn's "gift" from the start—why would her enemy suddenly show generosity?

The dresses remained untouched in her closet, but Olivia hesitated to reveal this. With so many hostile witnesses, even pristine items could somehow appear damaged.

Turning to Victoria, Olivia typed urgently: "Miss Ellington, please believe me, the—"

Victoria recoiled before she could finish.

Her gaze turned glacial, like frozen shards piercing Olivia's heart. "You truly are venomous."
###Chapter 117

The tension in the room was palpable.

"Even if you have personal grievances with Miss Hartley, those clothes she gave you were precious. Is this how you treat them?" Victoria Ellington's voice trembled with restrained fury. "Those were my mother's belongings. How can I not hold you accountable?"

The guests exchanged uneasy glances. Everyone knew how deeply Victoria mourned her late mother. To finally receive news of her mother's possessions, only to find them ruined—it was a cruel twist of fate. Who wouldn't be devastated?

Evelyn Hartley barely suppressed a smirk, her fingers tightening around Victoria's shoulder in a mock display of sympathy. "I'm so sorry, Victoria. I never imagined my disagreement with Olivia would hurt you like this. If I'd known, I wouldn't have given her those clothes."

Victoria wiped her tears with a delicate handkerchief. "It's not your fault. How could you have predicted this? The blame lies entirely with Olivia. She's the one responsible."

"Victoria." A deep voice cut through the murmurs.

A distinguished middle-aged man strode forward, his sharp gaze sweeping the room. Behind him followed a tall, imposing figure—Liam Blackwood.

Evelyn's smile faltered, and Olivia's breath hitched.

Victoria forced a strained smile. "Father."

Reginald Ellington's expression darkened as he took in his daughter's red-rimmed eyes. Victoria was known for her composure—seeing her this distraught was alarming.

"Victoria, has someone upset you?" His voice was ice.

The guests immediately launched into explanations, each account painting Olivia in a worse light. The collective resentment solidified into one damning conclusion: Olivia was at fault.

Reginald turned his piercing glare on Olivia. Without giving her a chance to speak, he declared, "Regardless of the circumstances, my daughter doesn't want you here. Today is her birthday. Her happiness is my priority."

Olivia's face paled. She stood frozen, the weight of their judgment crushing her.

She knew leaving would only fuel the rumors, but staying was impossible.

Liam remained silent, his expression unreadable. His indifference stung more than any accusation. She would’ve preferred his absence over this cold detachment.

Clenching her fists, Olivia typed out a message on her phone: "I apologize for the misunderstanding. The clothes are intact. I'll return them as soon as possible. But let me be clear—I never pushed Evelyn, nor did I intentionally disrespect your mother’s belongings."

No one paid her words any mind.

Reginald gestured toward the exit. "Leave. Now."

Olivia turned, her steps heavy.

Then Liam spoke.

"Wait."

He pulled out an invitation. "This is a forgery." His voice was sharp. "Care to explain why I was nearly barred from entering?"

Victoria's eyes widened. The invitation in Liam's hand was identical to Olivia's.

Her gaze snapped to Evelyn, who paled.

Liam continued, his tone cutting. "And since we're addressing misunderstandings, perhaps an apology is owed to my wife?"

Olivia turned, stunned.

Liam was defending her?

Then it clicked—this wasn’t about her. It was about the Blackwood name.

Victoria hesitated before stepping forward. "Olivia, I... I misjudged you. The invitation—I assumed the worst." Her voice grew quieter, her cheeks flushing with shame.

Olivia exhaled. "Miss Ellington, I swear I preserved your mother’s clothes. They’ve been in storage, so they might need minor repairs. But I’ll return them to you personally. You’d recognize if they were replicas, wouldn’t you?"

Victoria nodded stiffly.

The room fell silent.

The truth, it seemed, was far more complicated than anyone had anticipated.
###Chapter 118

Olivia Sinclair struggled to find the right words to respond.

This was the first time Olivia had truly examined Evelyn Hartley with such intensity.

Evelyn's eyes shone with such sincerity that it seemed impossible she could be capable of deception.

Olivia recognized she might have judged too harshly before, yet she couldn't ignore how her closest friend Victoria had been hurt by Evelyn. That incident had spread across social media, appearing undeniable.

Victoria's brow furrowed as she hesitated, torn between conflicting thoughts. Maybe Evelyn had a point. That innocent facade might hide something darker.

"Victoria," Evelyn interrupted suddenly, clutching her forehead as if struck by sharp pain.

Evelyn gripped Victoria's hand tightly. "I feel so dizzy. Will you take me to Mercy Hospital?"

Bringing up the headache now was clearly Evelyn's calculated move to remind Victoria of her suffering - allegedly caused by Olivia.

Victoria's protective instincts flared, her gaze turning icy as she glared at Olivia. "Forget it. Since those dresses seem connected to you, keep them. Whether they were my mother's means nothing to me."

Her words carried a subtle jab at Olivia.

Olivia felt heat rise to her cheeks as she bit her lip.

Before Evelyn could pull Victoria away, Olivia suddenly reached out and grabbed Evelyn's wrist.

Caught off balance, Evelyn nearly stumbled. Annoyance flashed across her face. "Olivia, what now? First you push me, and now this?"

Olivia quickly shook her head and used her phone's text-to-speech function: "Your injury looks serious. You mentioned dizziness - could it be a concussion?"

Evelyn frowned, studying Olivia suspiciously. Was this genuine concern?

Clutching her forehead dramatically, Evelyn gave Olivia a withering look. "Isn't it obvious? You pushed me hard. The doctors said this scar might never fade."

Reluctantly, Evelyn lifted her bangs to reveal a faint red mark.

The Hartleys had hired top specialists, yet the scar remained slightly visible. To most, it was barely noticeable.

But for perfectionist Evelyn, even this minor flaw was intolerable.

Tears welled in Evelyn's eyes as she sobbed, "Happy now? Everyone's seen it. I knew you didn't really care - you just wanted to humiliate me."

As Evelyn wept dramatically, she hid behind Victoria like a frightened child.

Victoria's face darkened with anger as she seized Olivia's wrist. "What's your game? Still trying to hurt Evelyn?"

Trapped, Olivia shook her head frantically, resorting to sign language few understood.

Flushing with embarrassment, Olivia desperately wished Victoria would release her so she could type an explanation.

But Victoria's grip only tightened, her eyes blazing with fury.

Then Liam Blackwood's icy voice cut through the tension.

"Release her before you break her wrist."

Under Liam's cold stare, Victoria reluctantly let go with a scoff. "Mr. Blackwood, while she's your wife, everyone knows she's manipulative and cruel. Evelyn's the one who deserves your affection. You don't need to pretend for Olivia's sake - no one here would blame you."

Victoria believed Liam only defended Olivia to save face. Meanwhile, Evelyn gazed at Liam with hopeful eyes.

Ignoring both women, Liam went straight to Olivia. Noticing her reddened wrist, anger flickered in his eyes though his voice softened. "Does it hurt?"

Olivia avoided Liam's outstretched hand. His kindness was always fleeting, and she'd learned not to expect anything. Keeping expectations low prevented disappointment.

Brushing past Liam, Olivia wanted to settle this quickly. Her phone's mechanical voice stated firmly: "I never meant to insult Miss Hartley. Right now, we should focus on exposing the real culprit."

The room fell silent, all eyes fixed on Olivia in confusion.

"What's she playing at? Didn't she push Evelyn down?"

"Probably trying to clear her name. Let's see what she does next."

Olivia stood confidently amidst the whispers.

Evelyn felt uneasy, tugging Victoria's sleeve. "We should go. She's just causing drama to steal attention. If we leave, her show ends."

Victoria bristled. "Why should we run? We face bullies head on. Don't worry, I won't let her frame you."

Despite Victoria's assurance, Evelyn remained unsettled.

Evelyn had specifically chosen that stairwell because it lacked surveillance. Olivia couldn't possibly have proof.

Feeling slightly reassured, Evelyn watched as Olivia signaled Nathaniel Bradford to start a projector.

While the stairwell had no cameras, the adjacent building did - something Evelyn had overlooked.

The footage was grainy but clearly showed two figures. Evelyn stood at the top, Olivia below. Suddenly, Evelyn tumbled down.

A stunned silence filled the room when the video ended.

Everyone had believed Olivia pushed Evelyn, especially given Evelyn's injuries. No one would willingly take such a fall.

Yet the video told a different story. Olivia hadn't touched Evelyn.

"No, that's not what happened!" Evelyn protested, face paling as she clenched her fists. "I didn't just fall - Daniel pushed me! The camera angle just didn't catch it!"

Before Evelyn could continue, Olivia swiftly played another clip showing Daniel waiting downstairs the entire time, only running up when he heard the commotion.

Victoria looked shocked, her eyes darting to tearful Evelyn.

Despite the evidence, Victoria stood by her friend, fixing Olivia with a stern look. "Olivia, videos can be manipulated," she stated firmly.
###Chapter 119

Olivia stood frozen, unable to defend herself. The video evidence could have been manipulated, but what about everything else?

With trembling hands, Olivia retrieved her phone and played a recording. This was from the day she'd swallowed her pride and begged Evelyn for mercy.

Such desperate measures were foreign to Olivia, but life had taught her harsh lessons.

As the audio played, Evelyn's sharp, commanding voice filled the room. Olivia's silent responses were lost to everyone present.

Then came the damning confession. Evelyn's voice rang clear: "I did try to push you that day. I just never expected your quick reflexes or dumb luck. But it doesn't matter now. No matter what I do, Liam will always choose me. If you'd actually fallen, no one would have cared."

Every syllable cut through the tension like a knife.

Olivia signed firmly, her gaze sweeping the room. She made it clear she'd welcome any investigation into the recording's authenticity. She was prepared to involve the police if necessary.

Victoria stood speechless. Her eyes darted between Olivia and Evelyn, the air thick with unspoken accusations.

Evelyn, pale with shock, stepped forward and struck Olivia across the face. "You scheming liar! This is all fabricated! Olivia, how could you sink this low?"

The force sent Olivia stumbling backward.

Cradling her stinging cheek, Olivia met Evelyn's glare with steely determination. Her phone's mechanical voice spoke for her: "Low? I learned from the master. If you hadn't started this game, I wouldn't have needed to play. You've only yourself to blame. Don't create secrets if you can't bear them being exposed."

Evelyn's hands shook with rage. "It's not me! The recording's fake! She must have hired someone to imitate my voice!"

Her protest died in her throat when she noticed Liam watching.

Others might doubt, but Liam knew the truth.

During the online harassment, Olivia had been in seclusion. She lacked both the time and resources to arrange such an elaborate scheme.

Moreover, Liam already possessed evidence proving Evelyn's fall had been staged.

Yet Evelyn refused to surrender. She'd sacrificed too much to destroy Olivia, only to have the tables turned so spectacularly.

With Olivia's innocence irrefutably established, Evelyn's desperate excuses fell on deaf ears.

Comparing the recording to the video made the truth undeniable: Evelyn had attempted to push Olivia but lost her balance instead.

Even with the facts laid bare, no apologies came Olivia's way.

To these people, Olivia remained just a mute nobody - insignificant without the Blackwood name. And with her strained relationship with Liam, most assumed he'd side with Evelyn.

Someone attempted to smooth things over with forced cheer. "Alright, let's all calm down. Clearly this was just a misunderstanding. Miss Hartley must have simply tripped, making it appear Mrs. Blackwood pushed her. Now that we know the truth, perhaps Miss Hartley should apologize. No harm done, right?"

Evelyn, visibly agitated, pointed to her forehead. "I'm the injured party here! She's perfectly fine while I'm hurt! Why should I apologize?"

The peacemaker persisted, "You make a fair point, Miss Hartley. You've suffered enough. Let's just move past this."

Olivia watched the exchange with bitter amusement. Was she expected to endure bullying simply because she appeared vulnerable? When the truth was unclear, everyone had been quick to condemn her, using the confusion as an excuse to unleash their cruelty.

Now that her innocence was proven, they expected her to quietly accept this injustice.

But Olivia refused to comply.

Before she could respond, a clear female voice cut through. "Easy for you to say. Imagine enduring what Olivia has. Cyberbullying, public humiliation, constant judgment. Could you remain so forgiving?"

Olivia turned in surprise. Victoria's defense was unexpected.

Evelyn looked equally shocked, stamping her foot in frustration. "Victoria! Whose side are you on? I thought we were friends! Has this little witch deceived you too?"

Victoria avoided Evelyn's gaze, her expression cold. "I stand with the truth. You claimed Olivia tormented you, making me disrupt my own birthday celebration to support you. Yet she's the victim here. If you hate her, fine, but you manipulated me against her. Is that how you treat friends?"

Evelyn faltered, guilt flashing in her eyes. "Victoria, you're my friend. Remember when I protected you from those harassers? Have you forgotten?"

Victoria hesitated, then straightened. She produced two invitations. "You accused Olivia of using fake invitations to crash this event. But her husband? Why would he need to? I entrusted all three invitations to you, never imagining you'd alter them to exclude Olivia and her husband. This was supposed to be my celebration. A true friend wouldn't have created this chaos today."

"You--!" Evelyn gasped, feeling the walls closing in.

Since her disfigurement, Evelyn had grown painfully sensitive. The weight of everyone's stares crushed her. Were they mocking her? Judging her? She couldn't possibly be at fault. The fault lay with Olivia.

As whispers spread, Evelyn's complexion turned ashen. She swayed, then collapsed to the floor.

Gasps filled the room. Despite everything, Victoria immediately called for help, directing someone to take Evelyn to the hospital.

Olivia spotted Liam among those rushing to Evelyn's side. She wondered if he'd resent her for publicly shaming Evelyn, then realized it no longer mattered. She'd cleared her name. Soon, she'd be free from living under the same roof as Liam.

But first, there was something far more urgent she needed to address.
###Chapter 120

Olivia approached Victoria with a tentative smile, her text-to-speech device set to a warm feminine tone. "Thank you for standing up for me earlier. I truly didn't expect that kindness."

Victoria blinked, suddenly self-conscious about her earlier assumptions. She turned her face slightly away. "Don't misunderstand - I was just being fair. And... I owe you an apology for misjudging you. But this doesn't make us friends."

Olivia's smile deepened. After a thoughtful pause, she typed, "Your mother's garments are in good hands. As a professional restorer, I can return them exactly as they were. Or if you prefer, I could give them a subtle refresh."

Victoria's posture softened, her eyes glimmering with memory. "It's not about preservation," she murmured. "Those clothes still carry my mother's scent. When I see them, I see her exactly as she was."

Olivia felt her throat tighten with shared sorrow. Carefully selecting her words, she typed, "Your mother must have been extraordinary to raise someone as compassionate as you."

"Compassionate?" Victoria scoffed, raising an incredulous eyebrow. "That's a first. Evelyn warned me about your silver tongue, though it seems painfully obvious you're forcing it. Save your flattery."

Olivia shook her head emphatically, fingers flying across her phone. "I mean every word. You're remarkable - fiercely loyal to your friends. Even Liam mentioned it."

"Liam?" Victoria's voice hitched. "What exactly did he say?"

Olivia recalled, brow furrowing slightly. "He said you're incredibly gifted with antiques. That with proper focus, you'd make an exceptional apprentice for Gregory."

Victoria's eyes instantly welled with tears.

The Ellingtons had never been wealthy, but their name carried generations of respect and integrity.

Victoria had inherited her father's stubborn pride, while her mother had been the family's gentle anchor - a presence Victoria barely remembered, having lost her so young.

As she grew, Victoria became increasingly withdrawn, her circle shrinking to a select few.

Many who initially seemed kind secretly mocked her as arrogant and temperamental, making her despise social gatherings.

One fateful night, thugs cornered Victoria on her way home.

The police arrived just in time, with Evelyn conveniently appearing as her savior.

This incident had made Victoria consider Evelyn a friend - a misjudgment she now bitterly regretted.

Attending this birthday party had been another mistake.

Victoria preferred intimate family celebrations, but Evelyn's relentless pressure wore her down.

Only now did she realize she'd been nothing but a pawn in Evelyn's schemes.

Seeing Victoria's tears, Olivia panicked, waving to regain her attention before typing urgently. "I envy you, truly. You were clearly raised with such love - that's why you trust so easily, even when it hurts you. My life... was different. No parents, no real family. The Blackwoods took me in, and I'll always be grateful. Henry protected me as a child, and Liam stood by me as I grew. But I know my place - I'll never truly belong, and one day I'll have to leave."

Victoria wiped her eyes, studying Olivia with new understanding. "The rumors... Liam is your husband, yet they say he's involved with Evelyn. I thought you were the one causing trouble between them."

Olivia looked away, her expression shadowed. "It's fine. I hold no grudges. The Blackwoods' kindness is something I'll cherish forever."

Victoria, perceptive beyond her years, pressed gently. "Just kindness?"

Meanwhile, Liam, having dealt with Evelyn, spotted the intense conversation from across the room.

Misreading the situation, he quickened his pace toward them.

As he approached, he caught Victoria's probing question: "Just kindness?"

Liam froze, his expression unreadable as he watched Olivia.

After a weighted pause, Olivia met his gaze with a fragile smile, typing carefully. "Yes, just kindness. Anything more would be... sibling affection. I confused that once, and it caused problems. But really, I'm fine."

Olivia had made her peace. She knew her path would diverge from Liam's, that he and Evelyn were inevitable. No more tangled emotions - just bury that foolish love where it belonged.

Unseen, Liam's hands clenched at his sides.

His phone buzzed - Sebastian calling.

Liam answered silently.

"Mr. Blackwood," came the urgent whisper, "Miss Hartley is refusing treatment at Mercy Hospital. She's demanding to see you. The entire Hartley family is causing a scene, blaming your wife—"

"I'm on my way." Liam cast one last lingering look at Olivia before striding away.

Olivia turned, sensing movement, but found only empty space behind her.

Victoria studied Olivia, sensing the half-truths but feeling her resentment fade. She was beginning to appreciate Olivia's quiet strength.

With a genuine smile, Victoria placed a hand on Olivia's shoulder. "I'll entrust you with my mother's collection. I'm planning an exhibition of her pieces - she had many devoted students. As Gregory's apprentice, this could be your chance to shine."

Olivia startled, typing rapidly. "No, that's unnecessary! Restoration is my job. If there's an exhibition, my involvement doesn't need mentioning."

Victoria shook her head, smiling. "Gregory rejected me, and it wounded my pride. You've helped me see clearly, Olivia. For that, I should thank you."
###Chapter 121

Olivia stopped protesting when Victoria spoke.

After saying goodbye to Victoria, Olivia left the Ellington estate.

Though most guests had departed, whispers about the banquet's dramatic events still lingered among the stragglers.

Evelyn might have silenced Olivia temporarily, but she couldn't stop the gossip spreading through high society.

By now, Nathaniel had probably convinced Westfield University officials to clear Olivia's name and expel Harrison.

Everything appeared to be falling into place.

The crisp night air sharpened Olivia's thoughts as she pulled out her phone to call a cab, completely missing the familiar black sedan parked nearby.

She was about to walk past when a sharp honk froze her in place.

Olivia's pulse quickened at the sight of the luxury vehicle. Could it be Liam?

When Daniel stepped out from the driver's seat instead, disappointment flashed across Olivia's face before she schooled her features.

Daniel greeted her with his usual charming smile.

Regaining her composure, Olivia approached him and explained the banquet incident had been resolved.

"I know, and I owe you for intervening," Daniel said, his eyes softening with sympathy. "Things have been difficult with Liam lately, haven't they?"

Olivia shook her head dismissively. She gestured that aside from Evelyn's antics, the situation had been manageable. More importantly, she'd gathered crucial evidence during the ordeal. Given the chance, she'd make the same choice to stay under Liam's roof again.

Daniel moved to open the passenger door. "You don't need to return to Liam's place. I've arranged secure private accommodations where you won't face similar disruptions."

Olivia remained rooted to the sidewalk, shaking her head gently. Her refusal carried more weight than just declining his offer.

Daniel's smile faltered, his voice turning urgent. "Olivia, please understand - this isn't about obligation. I'm just concerned as a friend."

Despite his earnestness, Olivia stood firm. She explained that with divorce proceedings imminent, she and Liam wouldn't remain friends, making it inappropriate to impose on Daniel either. True friendship shouldn't involve such burdens.

A bitter taste rose in Daniel's throat. "At least let me drive you home. After seeing Liam rush to Mercy Hospital where Evelyn was admitted, I assumed he'd left you stranded."

Olivia appeared unfazed, waving her phone to show she'd already booked a ride.

Just then, a taxi pulled up to the curb.

Daniel reached out instinctively, then let his arm drop. Natalie had been right - he needed to move forward instead of clinging to the past.

His phone rang with Natalie's call.

"Where are you?" Her voice was barely audible over background chatter. "Can you come back?"

Daniel frowned. "What's wrong? Is it urgent?"

Natalie sounded uncomfortable. "Just come see for yourself. I can't handle this alone."

Understanding dawned. "Another arranged match? Or another childhood engagement sprung from nowhere?"

Natalie's silence confirmed his suspicion.

Daniel massaged his temples as a headache formed.

"You don't have to come," Natalie whispered. "I only called because they pressured me in front of everyone."

Watching Olivia's taxi disappear, Daniel exhaled sharply. "Tell them I'll be there in twenty minutes."

"But—" Natalie sounded confused.

"Twenty minutes," Daniel repeated firmly before ending the call.

Natalie stared at her phone, emotions warring on her face.

Meanwhile, Olivia headed straight back to Liam's penthouse to collect her remaining belongings.

Confident that Evelyn's hospital stay and Liam's presence there would ensure she avoided them both, Olivia felt an unexpected lightness.

But her brief cheer evaporated when she arrived to find the door ajar.

Dread pooled in her stomach as she stepped inside.

Chaos greeted her - two gift boxes torn open, their contents shredded and scattered across the floor.

Evelyn's smug smile from earlier flashed through Olivia's mind.

She'd suspected Evelyn might tamper with the outfits during their Ellington visit, but hadn't realized the sabotage had been premeditated.

Which raised a disturbing question: how had Evelyn accessed the locked room?

The only explanation was that she'd obtained a key.

Hands trembling, Olivia dialed Liam's number.

The first call disconnected abruptly.

She tried again. And again.

On the fourth attempt, Liam finally answered with derision. "Why keep calling? Unless Ethan wants to speak, I'm busy."

Refusing to be dismissed, Olivia activated video call, her frantic gestures conveying distress. Though tears welled in her eyes, the distance prevented Liam from seeing them clearly.

Still, he noticed something amiss in her expression.

Olivia gestured sharply, demanding to know if he'd given Evelyn access to her room. She argued that even as a foster daughter, she deserved basic respect and privacy.

Liam's expression darkened. "What are you implying? What did she do?"

Olivia fought back tears, nearly showing the destroyed garments before stopping herself.

Her gestures turned furious as she practically shouted through sign language, "Just tell me - did you give her the key? You must have known her intentions weren't innocent!"

She could picture it - Evelyn clinging to Liam's arm, sweet-talking him into handing over the key without considering the consequences for Olivia.

Liam's grip tightened on his phone, veins standing out along his forearm. Olivia's direct accusation struck a nerve.
###Chapter 122

The line went dead, leaving Olivia in suffocating silence. She exhaled sharply, forcing down the acrid taste of betrayal rising in her throat. If this was where they stood, then Liam Blackwood deserved nothing more from her.

Her thumb jabbed the end call button with finality.

Olivia refused to drown in self-pity. The torn gown wasn't her fault, but she'd promised Victoria Ellington. A promise was sacred. She'd find a way to make this right.

Across town, Liam's grip tightened around his silent phone. His knuckles whitened.

He strode back into the hospital lounge where Frederick and Beatrice Hartley waited, their faces pinched with anxiety. They scrambled to their feet when he entered.

Frederick cleared his throat. "Liam, Evelyn acted rashly, but her heart was in the right place. The doctors say she's emotionally fragile right now. She needs our understanding."

"Understanding?" Liam's laugh was razor-sharp as he crossed his arms. His glacial stare made Beatrice shrink back. "What exactly would that entail?"

The Hartleys exchanged hopeful glances.

Beatrice ventured, "This is all a misunderstanding. Olivia may feel slighted, but publicly humiliating Evelyn was unacceptable. If Olivia apologizes at Evelyn's bedside, we can put this unpleasantness behind us."

Encouraged by Liam's neutral expression, Frederick added, "Our families are nearly bound by marriage. We shouldn't let an outsider cause discord."

"An outsider?" Liam's smile vanished.

He stood abruptly, looming over them. "I knew from the start Olivia never pushed Evelyn. I came to verify Evelyn's injuries myself - to ensure no mysterious bruises appeared on Olivia later."

Frederick's smile faltered. "What are you suggesting?"

"My mother's matchmaking fantasies are her own. I came to protect Olivia from your retaliation." Liam's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "But you actually dared threaten her. Do I look like someone you can manipulate?"

Frederick's face drained of color. "That's not—"

He'd assumed Liam had grown tired of the mute girl. With Liam visiting Evelyn daily and Margaret Winslow's obvious approval, the Hartleys had taken their alliance for granted.

But now Frederick noticed the chilling pattern - Liam only ever asked doctors about Evelyn's recovery timeline. His first question when she woke? Whether she remembered the "accident" clearly.

Liam hadn't been concerned for Evelyn at all. His focus had always been Olivia. The realization struck Frederick like a physical blow.

Beatrice burst into theatrical sobs. "Evelyn adores you! She's sacrificed so much—"

Liam ignored her. He seized Frederick's collar, hauling him up until their noses almost touched. Despite their age difference, Frederick trembled under the younger man's arctic glare.

"You'll control Evelyn. If she touches Olivia again..." Liam's whisper carried the weight of a death sentence. "And those online rumors disappear today. Or you'll regret it."

Frederick nodded frantically.

Satisfied, Liam released him with a disgusted shove. Storm clouds gathered in his eyes as he stalked out, the door slamming behind him like a gunshot.

The moment he left, the room's tension shattered. Beatrice collapsed into hysterical weeping. "Our Evelyn's chances with Liam are ruined!"

"Stop your blubbering," Frederick snapped, face mottled with shame and rage. "Liam and Olivia's breakup was inevitable. She was the Reeves' charity case - of course he'd defend her out of obligation. But Evelyn went too far fabricating that story about the push. For now, she must stay away from their drama. When Liam cools off, he'll remember their years together. He can't possibly—"

Beatrice relayed this to Evelyn, who promptly hurled a vase against the wall. "Wait? I've waited years! If I back off now, Olivia will steal him completely!"

Beatrice gasped as medical equipment crashed to the floor. "Evelyn! Liam clearly cares for you! He's just angry about this incident. Provoke him again, and you'll lose him forever!"

Tears streaked Evelyn's contorted face. "You don't understand!"

The terrible truth dawned on her - Liam's supposed affection had always been a performance to make Olivia jealous.

Evelyn's nails bit into her palms. There was only one solution now. Olivia Sinclair needed to disappear. Permanently. With her gone, Liam would have no reason to reject Evelyn.

Her whisper was venomous as she clutched Beatrice's wrist. "Mother... we need to talk."
###Chapter 123

"You'll help me, won't you?" Evelyn's voice was barely above a whisper, fragile as glass.

Beatrice's temples pulsed as she studied her daughter. No matter what had happened, Evelyn was still her flesh and blood. A wave of protectiveness surged through her.

"Of course, I'll help you," Beatrice murmured, brushing a strand of hair from Evelyn's forehead. "Rest now. I'll deal with anyone who tries to interfere."

Evelyn exhaled, the tension in her shoulders easing as her lips curved into a faint, grateful smile. Within moments, she was asleep.

Meanwhile, Olivia Sinclair stood amidst the wreckage of fabric and memories, her stomach twisting with unease. This restoration project was far more daunting than she'd anticipated.

Her phone buzzed—Victoria Ellington had sent two photos of her mother in exquisite gowns from decades past.

Though time had yellowed the edges of the photographs, the elegance of the woman in them remained untouched.

The sight only strengthened Olivia's resolve. She would bring these garments back to life.

First, she gathered every scrap of fabric she could salvage. Then, she mapped out a plan: she needed to visit vintage shops for replacement materials.

Most vintage pieces came with their own scars—frayed hems, faded colors, loose threads.

Olivia was no stranger to needlework, but this was beyond her usual skill. She needed guidance.

Reality, however, was unkind.

Shop after shop turned her away. Some dismissed her outright; others mocked her silence. Olivia clenched her jaw and moved on. Arguing with ignorance was a waste of breath she didn’t have.

Her last hope was a boutique tucked away in a quiet corner of Newport.

Genevieve Fontaine's Vintage Atelier had been a staple for years, its reputation impeccable despite its modest location.

Olivia arrived just before closing. The shop was nearly empty, save for the striking woman behind the counter.

Genevieve Fontaine was breathtaking—sharp cheekbones, piercing eyes, and an air of effortless grace.

After a quick introduction, Olivia typed out her request on her phone, adding that she was willing to pay for lessons if Genevieve didn’t have time for hands-on teaching.

Genevieve’s lips curved into a slow, knowing smile. "I don’t want your money."

Olivia’s heart sank. Another rejection.

But then—

"I’ll teach you," Genevieve said, tilting her head. "On one condition."

Olivia tensed.

Genevieve laughed, reaching out to pinch Olivia’s cheek playfully. "Relax, darling. I’m not asking you to rob a bank." She leaned in. "You’re stunning. I’ve been searching for a model for my new collection. Would you consider it?"

Olivia blinked. A model? She pointed at herself, eyes wide with disbelief.

Genevieve nodded. "You’d be perfect."

Olivia hesitated, then typed: "Are you sure?"

"Absolutely," Genevieve said. "Trust me."

Olivia exhaled. If Genevieve was willing to teach her for free, the least she could do was humor her. She nodded.

Genevieve’s excitement was contagious. She immediately pulled out three outfits—each wildly different from the last.

Olivia eyed them skeptically.

"Trust the process," Genevieve assured her, already reaching for her makeup kit. "I know what I’m doing."

The next few hours were a whirlwind.

Outfit changes. Makeup. Poses.

Genevieve worked with the precision of an artist, adjusting every fold of fabric, every angle of Olivia’s posture.

By the end, Olivia had learned more about garment repair than she’d expected—and Genevieve had a camera full of breathtaking shots.

"You’re a natural," Genevieve murmured, scrolling through the images. "Ever considered modeling professionally?"

Olivia shook her head, typing: "I can’t speak."

Genevieve waved a hand. "So? Talent doesn’t need a voice."

Before Olivia left, Genevieve hesitated. "Mind if I display these in the shop window? I can blur your face if you prefer."

Olivia shook her head again. She owed Genevieve this much.

"It’s an honor," she typed.

Genevieve beamed.

As Olivia stepped out into the evening air, she didn’t notice the passerby snapping photos of the display.

Nor did she see the caption he added before posting:

"Beauty in Silence—Newport’s Hidden Gem."

By morning, the post had gone viral.
###Chapter 124

Olivia was walking home with a light heart, completely unaware of the social media storm brewing about her.

Under Genevieve's skilled instruction, Olivia had quickly repaired Victoria's mother's vintage dress.

As she packed her sewing kit to leave, a sudden wave of dizziness made her sway dangerously.

She steadied herself against the armrest, one hand instinctively cradling her still-flat abdomen.

It struck Olivia how easily she lost track of time when working, often skipping meals. While she could handle hunger, her unborn child couldn't.

She whispered silent apologies to her belly, a pang of guilt twisting her heart. This baby might never hear her voice, let alone learn words from her.

But the melancholy passed quickly. Pulling out her phone, Olivia searched for healthy pregnancy meal plans before heading to the grocery store.

She now lived in the luxury condo William had arranged.

Browsing the supermarket aisles with focused determination, Olivia suddenly found herself nearly knocked over by a charging child.

Her arms flew protectively around her stomach. In her concentration, she hadn't seen the boy coming.

The child fell hard on his bottom and immediately began wailing.

Olivia's lips pressed into a thin line as she observed the tantrum-throwing boy. He appeared about eight, with a sturdy build. The impact had been minor, but a serious collision could have sent her to Mercy Hospital.

The child's piercing cries drew curious shoppers like moths to flame.

Not interested in drama, Olivia turned to leave.

"Stop right there!" A shrill voice cut through the air. "You think you can knock down my grandson and just walk away? What kind of behavior is that?"

Olivia kept walking.

The elderly woman proved persistent, grabbing Olivia's wrist with surprising strength.

Sharp nails dug into Olivia's skin, drawing blood.

Olivia gasped in pain and whirled around, her expression darkening.

The woman's face twisted with greater fury at being ignored. "Everyone, look at this! An adult bullying a child! I saw her push my grandson down with my own eyes, and now she acts innocent! This is outrageous! Apologize now!"

Olivia nearly laughed. Shaking off the woman's grip, she typed rapidly on her phone. "Your grandson ran into me. He fell on his own. If anyone owes an apology, it's him to me."

The woman's face flushed with rage before suddenly transforming into a mocking smirk.

"Why don't you speak? Ah, I see now—" Her eyes glittered with malice. "You're mute. Serves you right."

Several bystanders immediately protested.

"That's going too far. This young woman is clearly delicate. Your grandson is twice her size. And mocking her disability? That's cruel."

"I saw what happened. The boy ran into her."

Realizing public opinion was against her, the woman changed tactics. "Even if it was an accident, shouldn't she have helped him up? Instead she just watched him cry and walked away! Wouldn't you be angry if this happened to your child?"

She yanked the boy up, pointing dramatically at a faint red mark on his arm. "Look how he's hurt!"

In truth, the mark came from the child refusing to stop rolling on the floor.

As his wails continued, the crowd exchanged skeptical glances.

Olivia remained calm. Her hand drifted to her stomach, nearly revealing her pregnancy as explanation for not intervening. But she stopped herself—these strangers didn't need to know her private life.

The sharp-eyed woman noticed the gesture. Her eyes narrowed with sudden understanding. "Oh ho! Are you pregnant? I saw what you were buying—all prenatal items. Living alone, are we? Pregnant and unmarried? I wonder who the father is..."

Murmurs of disapproval rippled through the crowd. "That's completely inappropriate!"

The woman raised her voice triumphantly. "Oh, it's very much my business! She lives in the most exclusive building in our neighborhood. My son's been trying to buy there for months, yet she waltzed right in. There's something fishy going on. How does someone like her afford it? Probably some rich man's mistress. Disgusting!"

Olivia's face paled. This wasn't random—it was targeted hatred.

The neighborhood was Whitmore Holdings territory.

William had insisted Olivia move there for security reasons.

She'd complied, never imagining it would breed such resentment.

With steady fingers, Olivia typed: "Where I live is none of your concern. Continue spreading lies and I'll involve the police."

The woman faltered momentarily before pressing on. "Then prove you're not pregnant! I know what I saw—you're definitely expecting."

Her hands shook with excitement as she grabbed her phone. "I'm posting this in our community group. Let everyone see what kind of woman lives among us! Pregnant out of wedlock—how scandalous!"

Panic surged through Olivia. Most residents here were influential figures in tight social circles. The potential damage to the Blackwood family reputation if this got out...

Before Olivia could finish typing a response, the woman gave no chance.

In desperation, Olivia quickly messaged the police while trying to wrestle the phone away.

During the struggle, the boy saw his opportunity and shoved Olivia violently.

She stumbled backward, her waist hitting the sharp corner of a display table.

But instead of pain, Olivia found herself caught in strong, comforting arms as her vision swam.

Then an icy male voice sliced through the tension. "I'd like to see who dares spread rumors about my wife!"
###Chapter 125

Olivia barely caught her balance. The adrenaline from her near-miss still coursed through her veins, leaving her chilled and shaken. When had Liam arrived? How much had he heard?

Her nervous gaze flickered up to meet Liam's. His obsidian eyes revealed nothing, a perfect mask of indifference.

Liam sensed Olivia's stare but refused to acknowledge it. Instead, he pulled her protectively behind him, advancing with deliberate steps toward the elderly woman and her grandson.

The old woman recoiled slightly but held her ground. "You must be her husband? Let me enlighten you. Your wife has been unfaithful, carrying on with some man who bought her that penthouse. She's even pregnant with his child!"

"Is that a fact?" Liam's lips curled into a mocking smile, his eyes turning glacial.

He continued sharply, "You sound so certain. That must mean you have proof."

The elderly woman straightened proudly, believing she'd successfully planted seeds of doubt.

But Liam's next words shattered her confidence. "Since you claim to have witnessed everything, describe this man to me. Tell me when he visits, and I'll check the security footage. If I find nothing, that means you've been spreading malicious lies - a crime punishable by law. The length of your jail sentence would depend entirely on my mood. And if I'm particularly displeased, criminal charges could ruin your grandson's future prospects, especially with you as his legal guardian."

Though bluffing, Liam's mention of the boy's future struck terror into the woman's heart.

Her voice trembled. "Why should I be arrested because of your wife's scandalous behavior? It's suspicious how someone with no visible income can afford the most expensive residence in town! And she's always covering her stomach - doesn't that suggest pregnancy?"

Before Liam could respond, Olivia swiftly typed on her phone, the mechanical voice declaring: "You have zero evidence of pregnancy. These are baseless accusations damaging my reputation. We'll let the police determine the truth."

"No!" the woman gasped, panic rising. "Whether you're pregnant or not isn't my concern! I merely observed you might be. That's all!"

Bystanders erupted in laughter at the woman's desperate backtracking.

Humiliated, the elderly woman dramatically collapsed to the ground, wailing and beating her thighs. "The world's gone mad! Young people assaulting elders, knocking over children without apology, now threatening jail! Where's the justice?"

Olivia couldn't suppress a scoff at the woman's sudden concern for "justice."

The crowd, recognizing the absurdity, offered no sympathy to the dramatic performance.

Exhausted by the spectacle, Olivia tugged Liam's sleeve, signing her desire to leave.

He glanced down at her, hesitating briefly before nodding.

"Who's harassing my mother?" A furious shout cut through the crowd.

A barrel-chested man pushed forward, oblivious to his mother's theatrics and son's wails. His threatening demeanor made onlookers shrink back nervously.

Olivia's eye twitched in frustration. Would this circus never end?

The man's furious scan of the crowd halted abruptly when he spotted Liam. His expression transformed instantly. "M-Mr. Blackwood?" he stammered.

Olivia shot Liam a questioning look. Did they know each other?

Meanwhile, the elderly woman scrambled up at her son's arrival, pointing dramatically. "These hooligans! Look what they did to your son! Don't you work for Blackwood Enterprises? Didn't you brag about the CEO favoring you? Deal with these brats!"

As his mother continued berating Liam, the man's eye twitched violently. He looked ready to strangle her.

His stern glances failed to silence her tirade, which only grew more venomous.

Liam's voice turned arctic as he addressed Donovan Prescott. "Mr. Prescott, is this how your family operates? My wife lives in the neighborhood's finest residence, so your son attacks her while your mother spreads vile rumors about infidelity. Should all your neighbors expect such treatment?"

Each word struck Donovan like a physical blow. He visibly shook before collapsing to his knees.

"Mr. Blackwood, I swear I knew nothing! I came immediately! My mother's mind isn't right, and my son... he's just a mischievous boy! This is all my fault!" Donovan babbled desperately.

As he spoke, he began slapping his own face repeatedly, terrified.

The elderly woman paled, finally sensing the gravity of the situation, and fell silent.

But her spoiled grandson shattered the tense moment. Pointing at Olivia, he shrieked, "Dad, why kneel to her? Grandma says women like her are trash! Grandma says I should teach her a lesson!"

Olivia stood stunned. What kind of environment bred such a disrespectful child?

Donovan looked ready to vanish into thin air.

Liam's expression darkened. "If your son speaks this way, it reflects your parenting. That he'd insult my wife to my face makes me wonder what he says behind my back. You'll take time off to properly educate your son."

This "time off" was clearly a dismissal in disguise.

Liam continued icily, "You seem ill-suited for this community. Perhaps returning to your hometown would help you learn basic decency."

"No, please!" Donovan begged desperately, recognizing his career's abrupt end.
###Chapter 126

The murmurs from the crowd grew louder as Olivia Sinclair stood frozen in place.

"That family finally got what they deserved," a middle-aged woman muttered, adjusting her glasses. "They've been terrorizing this neighborhood for years."

A man in a leather jacket nodded vigorously. "Just last week, their brat of a son keyed my brand new Mercedes. When I confronted them, that old hag threatened to sue me for harassment!"

"My granddaughter came home crying yesterday," another woman chimed in, clutching her purse tightly. "That boy pushed her off the swings and laughed when she scraped her knee. The grandmother actually applauded him!"

Olivia's initial sympathy evaporated as she listened. These weren't just minor disputes - the Kensington family had systematically made everyone's lives miserable. Liam Blackwood hadn't been cruel; he'd done the entire community a favor.

The Kensingtons' desperate pleas for mercy fell on deaf ears as Liam turned away, his expression unreadable. Without warning, his hand shot out and clamped around Olivia's wrist.

She stumbled as he dragged her forward, her free hand flailing for balance. Shooting him a venomous glare, Olivia twisted her arm, trying to break free.

Liam's icy gaze didn't waver. "After that ridiculous phone call where you gestured like a deranged mime, I let it slide," he hissed. "If not for me today, you'd be picking up the pieces of your dignity from the pavement. A little gratitude would be appropriate."

Olivia's hands flew up in furious signs, her movements sharp and precise. Helping her today didn't erase his past wrongs - the two things weren't connected.

A dark chuckle escaped Liam as he grabbed her chin, forcing her to meet his eyes. "Wrongs? Enlighten me, Olivia. What exactly are these terrible crimes I've committed?"

Her expression shuttered, eyes dimming like lights being switched off. What was the point? Even if she explained, he'd never understand.

Liam's grip tightened as anger surged through him. The words came unbidden, explosive and raw. "You assumed I helped Evelyn with those keys? Do you really think I'd bother with something so trivial? Am I the only person who could access your apartment?"

Olivia listened impassively, then took a deliberate step back, putting physical distance between them. Her hands moved in quick, precise gestures: Then how did Evelyn get them?

"The butler gave them to her without my knowledge," Liam snapped.

Olivia's fingers flew faster now, her signs accusatory. Why would the butler obey Evelyn unless he believed it was Liam's wish? As the head of Blackwood Enterprises, wasn't Liam ultimately responsible for what happened in her apartment?

Liam stiffened, then his voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "You're twisting facts to fit your narrative."

A soft, bitter laugh escaped Olivia as she turned on her heel and walked away.

For a long moment, Liam remained rooted to the spot, torn between pursuit and pride. Finally, with a grimace, he yanked out his phone.

The butler answered on the second ring. "Mr. Blackwood, how may I—"

"You're fired." The words were glacial. "Pack your things and be gone within the hour."

"But sir, I—" The line went dead, leaving the butler pale and trembling. "It's over," he whispered to the empty room, knowing better than to question Liam's wrath.

Meanwhile, Olivia stormed into her apartment, slamming the door hard enough to rattle the frames. Between the Kensingtons and Liam, she'd failed to get groceries, and now hunger clawed at her insides. Her hands trembled as she pressed them to her queasy stomach.

Then came the inevitable knock.

Peering through the peephole confirmed her suspicions - Liam stood there, his expression thunderous. Olivia held her breath, praying he'd leave.

"Don't play games," his voice sliced through the door. "Open up or I'll find another way in."

With a frustrated growl, Olivia yanked the door open, signing sharply: What will it take for you to leave me alone?

"Let me in," Liam commanded.

She shook her head vehemently, bracing herself against the doorframe.

In one fluid motion, Liam scooped her up and over his shoulder. Olivia's startled yelp turned into a whimper as she instinctively cradled her stomach, her entire body tense with fear.

Liam frowned at her unusual reaction. Since when did she recoil from his touch like this? The realization that she might genuinely despise him sent a strange pang through his chest.

Depositing her gently on the couch, he noted how she immediately curled into a protective ball, one hand splayed across her abdomen. The sight of Olivia - usually so fiery - looking so small and vulnerable unsettled him.

"Are you sick?" Liam's brow furrowed as he reached out.

Olivia scrambled back, signing quickly: Just a stomachache. Nothing serious.

Liam's sharp eyes scanned the empty kitchen, the lack of groceries. "Have you eaten at all today?" His voice held an unfamiliar edge of concern.

She shrugged, signing that she'd been busy and it wasn't his concern anyway.

To her astonishment, Liam's expression softened. "Do you want me to cook for you?"

Olivia blinked, certain she'd misunderstood.

His jaw worked as he forced out the next words. "What would you like to eat?"

She shook her head, signing that she could manage on her own.

Liam's patience snapped. "Fine," he growled. "We'll do this the hard way. How does a hospital IV sound for dinner?"

The threat hung between them as Olivia's eyes widened in alarm.
###Chapter 127

Olivia froze when she heard Liam's unexpected offer. Her pulse quickened as she scrambled to her feet, waving her hands in protest. "Just something simple would be fine," she typed hastily on her phone.

Liam's irritation melted at her flustered response. He strode into the pristine kitchen and dialed Sebastian's number without hesitation.

When his phone buzzed with Liam's caller ID, Sebastian nearly dropped it. He checked twice to confirm it wasn't a prank. Even hearing Liam's distinctive voice didn't quell his disbelief.

"Mr. Blackwood, you want me to arrange grocery delivery... for cooking?" Sebastian's lips twitched with suppressed amusement.

A low growl came through the line. "Do you have a problem with that?"

"None whatsoever! I'll have everything delivered immediately!" Sebastian snapped to attention, chastising himself for overstepping.

After hanging up, Sebastian barked orders to his team with unusual urgency. "Deliver and leave immediately. Do not disturb Mr. Blackwood under any circumstances."

True to his reputation, Sebastian had everything Liam needed within fifteen minutes. Olivia watched from the doorway as Liam moved with surprising confidence around the kitchen, her emotions in turmoil.

This domestic scene felt surreal. Liam's sudden kindness unsettled her more than his usual coldness. Perhaps he felt guilty about Evelyn's actions, but Olivia no longer needed such gestures.

When Liam presented an impressive spread of dishes, Olivia's eyebrows shot up. The food looked professionally prepared - far beyond her expectations.

Liam sat across from her without serving himself. "Try it," he urged, his voice rough with uncharacteristic vulnerability. His intense gaze tracked her every reaction.

Olivia took a tentative bite. The flavors exploded on her tongue, surpassing anything she'd imagined. She gave an appreciative nod, complimenting his skills while thanking him politely. Her words were gracious, but her eyes remained guarded.

Memories flooded back - all those years she'd spent perfecting recipes to please him, while he'd often refused to eat her cooking. The irony wasn't lost on her.

She remembered one childhood incident when the servants had neglected her. Young Liam had stormed in, fired the staff immediately, then attempted to cook for her. The disastrous scrambled eggs had convinced her to ban him from the kitchen forever.

Now, seeing his culinary mastery, a painful realization struck - he'd simply chosen not to cook for her before. These skills had clearly been developed for Evelyn's benefit.

The silence between them grew oppressive. Liam's unwavering stare made Olivia's skin prickle. Finally setting down her fork, she met his gaze directly. "What is it?"

Liam feigned nonchalance. "So what are your plans? Staying here?"

Olivia nodded cautiously.

His knuckles whitened as he clenched his fists. "Whatever Evelyn did, that wasn't me. I never gave her keys. Had no idea she'd approach the butler." A muscle jumped in his jaw. "I fired him, by the way."

Olivia blinked in surprise. So this was about clearing his conscience. She sighed, telling him it didn't matter now - some things couldn't be undone.

Liam searched her face desperately, but found only detachment. He shifted uncomfortably, crossing his long legs. "I'm taking Evelyn away soon. Too much has happened. If you need anything, Sebastian can help."

Olivia's lashes fluttered briefly before she nodded with practiced indifference.

Frustration bubbled in Liam's chest. The vibrant girl who once followed him everywhere had vanished, replaced by this guarded stranger. Had his possessiveness turned love into resentment? Had she become a caged bird desperate for freedom?

His chair screeched violently as he stood suddenly. Olivia startled at the abrupt movement.

Liam's expression darkened. Why was she so unaffected? Had his attempt at reconciliation meant nothing? Or did she assume this was all for Evelyn's benefit?

Before he could speak, Olivia typed rapidly. "I promise not to interfere with Evelyn if she leaves me alone. What happened was inevitable. I won't disrupt your lives."

Liam's eyes turned glacial. "Is that really how you feel?"

When she didn't respond, he laughed bitterly. "Fine. Remember your words today."

Olivia bit her lip hard enough to draw blood, hiding her anguish.

Without another word, Liam turned on his heel. The door slammed with finality behind him.

Olivia didn't watch him leave. Hot tears spilled over despite her efforts. The lavish meal mocked her - a temporary illusion of domesticity that evaporated with Liam's departure.

Determined to erase this moment, she resolved to throw everything away untouched.

As she gathered her composure, Olivia reminded herself to keep moving forward.

Later, with the repaired dresses carefully packaged, Olivia rushed to meet Victoria, anxiety twisting her stomach. The damage had been extensive - would her efforts be enough?

To her shock, Victoria's eyes welled up the moment she saw the restored garments.

Flustered, Olivia typed an apology. "This was the best I could do. I'm so sorry if it's disappointing."

Victoria suddenly grasped Olivia's hands, tears streaming down her face. "No, you don't understand," she whispered. "These are perfect. Now I see why Gregory chose you. You've worked miracles."

Victoria's unexpected praise left Olivia speechless. For the first time in weeks, a glimmer of hope flickered in her chest. Perhaps this new path held possibilities she'd never imagined.
###Chapter 128

Olivia Sinclair froze at Victoria Ellington's words. How had Victoria known about the damaged condition of the garments beforehand?

She had contemplated sharing the truth with Victoria but held back, worried it might distress her. Olivia decided to attempt restoring the items herself first, intending to confess only if her efforts failed.

"Thank you," Victoria whispered emotionally, squeezing Olivia's hand. "I don't even know how to express my gratitude."

Curious, Olivia typed on her phone, "Who told you about the damaged clothes earlier?"

Victoria opened her mouth to respond when a deep baritone voice interrupted from behind. Reginald Ellington had arrived.

The usually stern patriarch approached with purposeful strides, his expression softening at Olivia's presence. "Mrs. Sinclair, I've been meaning to personally apologize for my behavior at the gala. Time got away from me. Victoria is my entire world, and my words were out of line. Please accept my sincere apology."

Olivia immediately shook her head, assuring Reginald she bore no ill will.

Victoria carefully handed the restored garments to her father as if presenting sacred relics. "Father, look! Olivia repaired them perfectly. Isn't she incredible?"

Tears welled in Reginald's eyes as recognition dawned. "Your mother wore this one during our first date... and I gifted her that one for her twenty-fifth birthday. Over the years, so many of her possessions were lost for various reasons. I've searched everywhere... I thought they were gone forever. I was—"

"Mrs. Sinclair," Reginald turned to Olivia with profound gratitude, "words cannot express my thanks." He extended a formal invitation. "We'd be honored if you'd join us for dinner this evening."

Seeing the hopeful gleam in Victoria's eyes, Olivia accepted with a warm nod.

The young woman then excitedly proposed creating an exhibition of her mother's cherished belongings.

Reginald's face lit up. "An excellent idea. Let me know how I can assist."

Observing their affectionate interaction, Olivia felt an unexpected pang of loneliness. During her brief time with the Ellingtons, she'd experienced such familial warmth—fleeting moments that now seemed painfully distant.

Yet the atmosphere at the Ellington residence remained welcoming. Despite his naturally serious demeanor, Reginald made concerted efforts to include Olivia in conversation.

Noticing her silence, he summoned a servant fluent in sign language to facilitate communication.

Victoria beamed at her father's thoughtful gesture.

Leaning close, she whispered to Olivia, "Father rarely speaks this much with new acquaintances. He must truly admire you."

Olivia gestured modestly that she'd simply honored her promise—no thanks were necessary.

Victoria's expression suddenly turned serious. "Olivia, there's another matter I wish to discuss. I hope you'll consider it favorably."

Before she could elaborate, a flustered servant interrupted. "Miss Ellington, Miss Hartley has arrived unannounced and insists on seeing you."

Given their recent estrangement, the staff knew better than to admit Evelyn without permission.

Victoria exchanged a meaningful glance with Olivia before shaking her head. "Send her away."

The servant hesitated. "Miss Hartley threatens to camp at our gates if denied entry."

Olivia gestured that confronting Evelyn might be wiser—the woman's notorious stubbornness could create unnecessary drama.

With a resigned sigh, Victoria relented. "Very well. Show her in."

Moments later, a visibly distressed Evelyn entered the hall. "Victoria, I feared you'd never speak to me again—" Her voice caught when she noticed Olivia.

Victoria rose, her expression guarded. "Allow me to introduce my dear friend, Olivia Sinclair. Since you're already acquainted, I'll spare the formalities."

Evelyn's hands clenched into fists. She'd come strategically prepared—pale complexion devoid of makeup, eyes red-rimmed from crying—a calculated display meant to evoke sympathy.

She hadn't anticipated Olivia usurping her place during her brief hospitalization.

"How could you associate with someone I despise?" Evelyn's voice dripped with venom. "Has she deceived you too?"

Victoria's brow furrowed. "Deceived? I'm perfectly capable of discerning character."

Evelyn's face flushed as fresh tears appeared. "Victoria, I only worry for you! Don't you remember our history? How I risked everything to save you? You promised never to forget."

When her emotional appeal failed, Evelyn doubled down on guilt-tripping.

Victoria's resolve wavered momentarily. Observing this, Reginald cleared his throat pointedly.

"Your heroic act is something I'll always appreciate," he stated firmly. "As my only child, Victoria is precious to me, and by extension, so were you. Miss Hartley, Victoria has supported you unquestioningly through every hardship. The Ellington family has extended considerable generosity. A true friend wouldn't exploit that."

Evelyn protested hastily, "I would never—"

Under Victoria's piercing gaze, she faltered.

As anger simmered within her, Victoria realized how Evelyn had manipulated her trust, nearly placing her in an untenable position. Had she rejected Olivia yesterday on Evelyn's behalf, she would have borne the consequences when the truth emerged—potentially tarnishing the Ellington name irreparably.
###Chapter 129

The realization hit Victoria like a thunderbolt. Evelyn's motives for causing chaos at her birthday party became crystal clear. She had been set up to take the fall.

It was Reginald's revelation that finally made everything click into place. Victoria stood abruptly, gripping Evelyn's wrist with surprising strength as she marched them both outside. "You might think I'm cruel, but this friendship ends here."

Evelyn's tears flowed freely, yet her gaze burned with stubborn defiance.

Even at the threshold, Evelyn refused to leave gracefully. "Victoria, I admit I was wrong. I let my anger control me. Liam and I were fine until Olivia interfered. I lost my head and made a terrible mistake. Please don't cut me out of your life."

Victoria's expression remained icy, her voice cutting. "I've known Olivia longer than you've breathed. I don't need lectures about her character from anyone."

Evelyn's lips quivered violently. "You're right. This was all a misunderstanding. My fault entirely. Are you really going to throw away years of friendship over this?"

Her eyes brimmed with fresh tears as she played her trump card. "I remember your passion for antique restoration. Liam never appreciated your talent, but I've got connections. There's a world-renowned expert looking for apprentices. If you're interested, I can arrange an introduction. Besides, Olivia is one of Gregory's apprentices, and she's never said a kind word about you to him."

Victoria's face darkened further at this revelation, prompting Evelyn to backtrack hastily. "Though I'm sure Olivia has her reasons..."

A curt nod was Victoria's only response. "Appreciate the thought, but unnecessary. I've already found a superior mentor for my restoration work."

Evelyn's jaw dropped. "Who could possibly be better?"

A humorless smile touched Victoria's lips. "Truthfully? Olivia's exceptional. If she'll have me, I'll be her apprentice. So you needn't concern yourself with my career."

Disbelief twisted Evelyn's features. "Victoria, you can't be serious! Why her?"

Victoria offered no explanation.

Just then, the car arrived. Victoria held the door open. "Miss Hartley, I have prior commitments. I won't be seeing you off."

Evelyn's face flushed crimson as she bit her lip hard and climbed inside.

As the car began moving, rage overcame Evelyn. She suddenly bolted from the vehicle and stormed into Liam's car.

Liam frowned in annoyance. "Finished causing scenes?"

Evelyn's voice trembled with indignation. "Liam, they treated me horribly! Don't you care?"

His lips curled in a mocking half-smile. "I warned you Victoria's no pushover. You chose to provoke her. This is on you."

Humiliation burned Evelyn's cheeks as tears spilled over. She clutched at Liam's hand desperately.

His expression darkened with irritation. Reaching his limit, Liam abruptly exited and strode toward another vehicle.

Evelyn stared in shock as he walked away without a backward glance. Scrambling out in her heels, she ran after him. "Liam! You promised a trip to cheer me up! What am I supposed to do now?"

He shot her a dismissive look. "Plans change. You're insufferable right now. Don't worry - someone else will entertain you."

Evelyn paled but forced a shaky smile. "You're joking, right?"

Without responding, Liam gestured sharply. Several bodyguards materialized, surrounding Evelyn. Ignoring her pleading eyes, they guided her firmly into a different car.

Trapped between two guards with no escape, Evelyn overheard Liam's chilling instructions to Sebastian: "Keep her out of my sight. I can't stand her right now, but make sure everyone thinks she's still with me."

Horror dawned on Evelyn's face as she understood - she was being used again as a pawn in Liam's game to make Olivia jealous.

Sebastian hesitated. "Mr. Blackwood, is this truly necessary?"

Liam's glacial stare silenced him. "Since when do I justify my decisions to you?"

Sebastian immediately set about executing the orders.

As Evelyn's car drove away, Liam didn't spare it a glance. His expression darkened as he took one last look at the Ellington estate before turning on his heel.

Three days later, Evelyn found herself abandoned in a remote village thousands of miles from civilization.

Liam had praised the location's fresh air and tranquility, claiming it was perfect for her to "recover."

Dragging her suitcase through mud, Evelyn's frustration mounted. Her parents had actually approved this exile, believing any connection to Liam was worth maintaining, regardless of her suffering.

Blind rage overtook her. She hurled her suitcase violently, losing her balance and tumbling into the mud.

Drenched and filthy, the polished socialite was unrecognizable.

"Bitch! Whore!" she screamed, directing her fury at Olivia and Victoria since she couldn't attack Liam directly.

Eventually, Evelyn calmed enough for clarity. One realization stood out - she still held leverage over Victoria.

The exhibition of Victoria's mother's belongings had been a resounding success, attended not just by students and beneficiaries but by society's elite.

During the event, Victoria had publicly praised Olivia, even declaring her as her closest friend.

This endorsement had shocked those who'd previously scorned Olivia, given the Ellington family's prestige.

Evelyn's own social standing had largely depended on her association with Victoria.

Once viewed as a disposable woman the Blackwoods would discard, Olivia's fortunes had reversed thanks to Victoria's support.

With such powerful backing, high society began reevaluating their stance toward Olivia. At minimum, they could no longer openly dismiss her.
###Chapter 130

Olivia instinctively understood Victoria's intentions behind the arrangement. She was deeply touched by her friend's thoughtful gesture.

The exhibition had finally ended, giving Olivia a much-needed chance to breathe.

The Whitmore Holdings team wasn't expecting her back immediately, and Gregory's studio was in its seasonal lull.

The timing was perfect for Olivia to take a step back and clear her mind. She had considered going out, but before she could, Natalie burst through her door, panting with excitement.

"Sweetheart, do you realize you're trending right now?"

Natalie's eyes sparkled with enthusiasm.

Olivia tensed, bracing for another wave of bad news. Her pulse quickened with unease.

But Natalie quickly shoved her phone into Olivia's hands, directing her to a link she'd sent.

Olivia's anxiety melted into relief as she scrolled through the post. Photos of her modeling vintage dresses at Genevieve's boutique had unexpectedly gone viral.

Genevieve, protective of Olivia's privacy, had kept her identity hidden.

Yet, the recent exhibition had led curious netizens straight to the stunning woman in the photos.

The comments section buzzed with admiration.

"She's breathtaking. What a waste that she's not in entertainment."

Natalie leaned in, eyes gleaming. "The industry isn't just glamour and drama, but my family owns a talent agency. It's no rival to the Blackwoods, but they'd back you fully. Olivia, this could be your moment. Imagine having wealth, fans, and influence. Evelyn would think twice before messing with you. With a little luck, you could carve out your own empire. Doesn’t that sound tempting?"

For a second, Olivia felt the pull of the idea. But then reality crashed back in. She gestured to her throat, signing, I'm mute. Have you ever heard of a star who can't speak? I couldn’t act. I'd just be a pretty face. I don’t want that. Let’s drop it.

Natalie hesitated, watching what she saw as a golden opportunity slip away. Still, she squeezed Olivia's hand. "It's okay. You'll always be incredible to me. Whatever you decide, I support you."

Olivia smiled warmly, touched by her friend's loyalty. But she couldn’t linger—she had urgent matters to attend to.

After Natalie left, Olivia texted Isabella.

Since Olivia hadn’t been at Whitmore Holdings lately, Isabella had been occupied with her own work.

So when Olivia unexpectedly requested a meeting, Isabella assumed something was wrong and rushed to the café.

"Is everything alright?" Isabella scanned Olivia with concern. "I heard you've been dealing with Miss Ellington. Has she been giving you trouble?"

Olivia laughed softly, warmth flooding her chest. She shook her head, then signed, I need a favor. I need to contact Alexander, but I don’t know his schedule.

She hesitated, worried that showing up unannounced might cause problems.

Isabella’s expression shifted slightly. "Is it urgent?"

Olivia considered, then signed that while it wasn’t an emergency, she did have something important to discuss.

Isabella stood abruptly. "Give me a moment—I need to make a call."

Olivia watched her step away, unease coiling in her stomach.

Ten tense minutes later, Isabella returned. "Alexander’s swamped. He won’t be able to meet, but William can see you instead?"

Olivia agreed without hesitation.

It had been too long since she’d last seen William. Her days had been a whirlwind of tasks, leaving no room for anything else.

She also sensed tension from most of the Whitmores. They seemed displeased with the arrangements Alexander and William had made for her.

Wanting to avoid conflict, Olivia had minimized contact with the rest of the family.

Steeling herself, she climbed into the car with Isabella, unaware they were heading to Mercy Hospital.

Olivia frowned. William was sick? The news had been kept so tightly under wraps that not even rumors had leaked.

William’s status granted him an exclusive VIP suite on the hospital’s restricted upper floor. Access required a special keycard.

Olivia hesitated at the elevator.

Isabella glanced back. "Everything okay?"

Olivia signed, I understand the family wants privacy. Since I’m not family, maybe I shouldn’t go up. I can visit when he’s better.

Isabella shook her head gently. "William has always said you’re not an outsider to him."

The words struck Olivia like a warm embrace, bringing unexpected tears to her eyes. She hadn’t realized how much his acceptance meant.

Resolved, she followed Isabella upstairs.

Other Whitmores lingered in the hallway, their expressions far from welcoming.

Nearby, muffled sobs sent Olivia’s nerves on high alert.

Isabella squeezed her hand reassuringly. "Don’t worry. It’s not as bad as it looks. They’re just dramatic."

Before they could enter, a man blocked their path.

Tall and striking, his gaze was ice-cold. Disdain dripped from his voice as he addressed Olivia. "Miss Sinclair, isn’t it inappropriate to bring an outsider here? My grandfather’s condition is private. Can you guarantee no leaks?"

Isabella remained calm. "Mr. Hawthorne, this is Olivia Blackwood. William knows and trusts her. If you doubt me, confirm with Alexander Whitmore."

Julian Hawthorne clenched his jaw but stepped aside reluctantly.

As they moved forward, Isabella whispered, "That’s Julian. William once had a daughter he adored, but she fell for a man with no ambition. William couldn’t tolerate it. She eloped, hoping to change his mind. He cut ties completely."

The weight of the story settled over Olivia as they stepped into the room.
###Chapter 131

Olivia instinctively turned at Isabella's explanation.

There he stood beside Alexander - Julian Hawthorne with his mother Eleanor at his side. The delicate features of the woman contrasted sharply with her age, her petite frame radiating an air of fragility that demanded sympathy. This was undoubtedly William's youngest daughter and Julian's mother.

Isabella continued, "Later, Eleanor's husband apparently died in a car accident. When she learned of William's illness, she brought Julian back to care for him. William couldn't bring himself to be harsh with his own flesh and blood. Now with William's declining health, Eleanor and Julian manage everything. At his age, William values family unity above all, so tensions have eased somewhat."

Olivia pressed her lips together, remaining silent.

Noticing her reaction, Isabella smiled knowingly. "You sense something's off, don't you?"

Olivia gave a slight nod.

If Eleanor truly respected William, why had she caused him such distress over a man years ago? William had disowned her once, and she'd chosen to stay away all these years. Yet now, with William's health failing, she'd returned with her son in tow.

Still, this was another family's drama, and Olivia refrained from further comment.

They entered William's hospital room. Seeing the frail figure in bed, Olivia's eyes welled with tears.

William appeared surprisingly alert today. He'd been gazing out the window but turned at their entrance. Spotting Olivia, his face lit up. "You came." With the nurse's help, he struggled to sit up and beckoned her closer.

Olivia rushed to his side, taking his fragile hand in hers.

The paper-thin skin and protruding bones sent a pang through Olivia's heart, resurrecting painful memories of Henry Winslow's final days. Though years had passed, the wounds felt fresh, the trauma of loss still vivid.

She hated watching loved ones suffer in their twilight years. Tightening her grip, she wished she could transfer some of her strength to him.

Noticing her distress, William offered a weak smile. "Don't fret, my dear. This path comes to us all. I'm just grateful you're here now. My old friends await me - it's nearly reunion time. And I'm not suffering, truly."

Olivia struggled to speak past the lump in her throat, but William's words brought unexpected comfort.

Dabbing her eyes, she forced a smile. Quickly typing her response, she used the text-to-speech function rather than sign language for William's benefit. "I'm fine, Mr. Hayes. Just focus on getting better. No talk of goodbyes yet."

William nodded understandingly.

Seeing him tire, Olivia prepared to leave. Giving his hand one final squeeze, she quietly exited.

Before departing on an errand, Isabella caught up with her. "Alexander plans to stop by later to discuss something with you."

Having matters to discuss with Alexander herself, and no other commitments, Olivia decided to wait.

She nodded her goodbye to Isabella.

Stepping into the hallway, Olivia found herself face-to-face with Julian.

Bracing for confrontation, she stepped back - only to see remorse in his expression.

"I owe you an apology," Julian said. "Grandfather's condition has me on edge, and the doctor's prognosis wasn't good. I behaved rudely earlier. Isabella mentioned your close bond with him. Your visits lift his spirits immensely. I was wrong to be discourteous - I should be thanking you instead."

Olivia blinked in surprise at his reasonableness. Studying him closely, she noted genuine sincerity in his eyes. His concern for William appeared heartfelt.

Her expression softened as she typed her reply. "Your concern for William speaks well of you. No offense taken - I'd likely react similarly in your position."

Julian's cheeks flushed slightly. "Thank you for understanding. Might I have your contact information?"

Seeing Olivia's hesitation, he quickly added, "Since you'll want to visit again, and Mother and I handle all hospital arrangements, it would streamline things if we exchanged details. Just message when you plan to come, and I'll ensure everything's prepared."

The request seemed reasonable. Olivia provided her secondary contact information.

After exchanging details, needing solitude, Olivia excused herself toward the lounge.

As she walked away, Julian's smile faded as he examined her contact information.

Eleanor approached with a disapproving frown. "That mute girl - I can't fathom why Father favors someone like her. He must be losing his faculties."

Julian smirked. "Mother, her background isn't what you think. Regardless, we should support Grandfather's choices. If he likes her, we should too. It proves we're the most prudent of his grandchildren."

Eleanor lowered her voice. "She seemed quite willing to give you her number. Perhaps she's interested? You should pursue this."

Julian's expression soured. "Really, Mother? You think I'd date someone who can't hold a conversation? Imagine introducing her to our circle. Still...perhaps I'll humor her. We'll see how things develop."

Eleanor fell silent.

Thirty minutes later, Alexander arrived.

Olivia emerged at the commotion, curious about the reason.

Alexander visited William accompanied by a medical team.

Ever methodical and decisive, Alexander handled every situation with precision.

When Julian and Eleanor tried to follow him in, Alexander's bodyguards barred their way.

Years of honed observation skills let Olivia catch the brief flash of resentment in Julian's eyes.

The contents of William's hospital room conversation remained a mystery.

When Alexander emerged, he looked more exhausted than ever.

Julian and Eleanor moved toward him eagerly, but something about them clearly irritated Alexander.

His face remained impassive, eyes distant and cool as they swept over the pair.

Eleanor looked ready to protest, but Julian whispered something that calmed her, leading her away.

Noticing Olivia in the corner, Alexander brushed past Julian and strode directly toward her.
###Chapter 132

"Olivia," Alexander began, his voice tinged with remorse as their eyes met. "I genuinely regret dragging you into this. The workload has completely consumed me lately—it's been absolute chaos."

Olivia waved off his apology with a graceful hand gesture. Her fingers danced across her phone screen as she typed: "I saw William earlier. He seemed slightly unwell, but nothing alarming. Just stress taking its toll. Some proper rest should restore him."

Watching her understanding response, Alexander's tense features softened into a rare, genuine smile that reached his storm-gray eyes.

"Thank you."

They entered the private hospital suite together.

Olivia typed another message: "Mr. Hayes, what specifically did you need to discuss?"

Alexander outlined the crisis concisely. Whitmore Holdings had suffered a logistics disaster—a critical shipment of antiques arrived damaged. The dilemma lay in determining whether their transportation team or the third-party handling port exports bore responsibility.

Olivia's delicate brows knitted in confusion. She typed: "I don't understand how I can assist with this."

Alexander shifted his weight uncomfortably. "This client represents a decades-long relationship. The damaged shipment contained his most coveted piece—one I spent weeks locating. You're the only restoration expert I trust with this caliber of work."

Olivia blinked in surprise at the revelation. Her fingers moved swiftly: "Restoration is my profession. Why call this a favor?"

Alexander shook his head, his expression grave. "He's notoriously perfectionistic. Unless the restoration is flawless, he'll reject it. While the work may be routine for you, satisfying this client won't be." He hesitated before adding, "My offer stands—join Whitmore Holdings permanently. If your current position dissatisfies you, I'll arrange something better."

Olivia fell silent, contemplating. That Alexander would approach her—knowing his vast resources—spoke volumes about his desperation. Finally, she typed: "I'll accept the commission."

Visible relief washed over Alexander's face, his shoulders relaxing. "Your understanding means everything," he said with heartfelt sincerity.

Later, an unsettled feeling prompted Olivia to message Isabella. Something felt deliberately omitted in Alexander's explanation. Normally she avoided meddling, but genuine concern drove her now.

After persistent questioning, Isabella reluctantly confessed. "Truthfully, this involves your husband. Mr. Hayes forbade me from telling you. I never wanted to keep secrets from you."

The mention of Liam sent Olivia's pulse racing.

As Isabella explained, the puzzle pieces clicked into place. The logistics company Whitmore Holdings partnered with turned out to be a Blackwood Enterprises subsidiary.

Renowned for handling complex international shipments flawlessly, Blackwood's logistics division had served the Hayes family impeccably for years.

Until now.

Both parties vehemently denied fault as accusations flew.

The conflict escalated when the client learned of the damage.

Worse, someone began circulating malicious rumors—claiming Whitmore deliberately sabotaged shipments to extort Blackwood.

This narrative painted the Hayes family as scheming villains.

William's sudden illness amid the scandal only deepened the crisis.

Olivia texted Isabella: "Even if Blackwood's involved, Liam wouldn't condone this. He's likely unaware."

Warmth flooded Olivia's cheeks at Isabella's reply: "You still care for him, don't you?"

Her fingers flew across the screen: "It's not that. I know Liam. He'd investigate thoroughly—whether it involved Blackwood or Whitmore. He'd never let rumors damage the Hayes family unchecked!"

The argument held merit. Liam wasn't one to evade responsibility or scapegoat others. Identifying the truth mattered most.

Isabella sighed audibly. "Olivia, I hate asking, but your help could save Whitmore Holdings. William's too aged for this stress. With Eleanor and Boris handling hospital matters, Alexander bears everything alone. You know how the Hayes family operates."

Indeed she did.

While William raised Alexander impeccably, the rest of the Hayes clan excelled only at shirking responsibilities.

The weight pressing on Alexander's shoulders was almost tangible.

Taking a steadying breath, Olivia typed decisively: "William's always supported me. I'll help however possible. Just tell me what's needed."

Isabella's relief was palpable. "Could you speak with Liam? Not expecting miracles, but perhaps he could mediate..."
###Chapter 133

The moment Isabella mentioned needing to speak with Liam, Olivia felt a wave of uncertainty crash over her. Her relationship with Liam had become a tangled web of complications. Showing up unannounced might only drive him further away.

Yet Olivia understood the desperation behind Isabella's plea. The fact that her assistant had reached out at all spoke volumes.

After a brief hesitation, Olivia typed her reply: "I'll try, but I can't promise anything."

Isabella's response came quickly, laced with relief. "That's all I ask. Just try. There's always hope."

The exchange left Olivia's heart heavy as she opened her messaging app. Her fingers hovered over Liam's contact before freezing mid-air.

A realization struck her - Liam was currently vacationing with Evelyn. Bringing this up now could spark another round of misunderstandings.

Changing tactics, Olivia decided to message Sebastian instead. She briefly considered being subtle, then dismissed the idea. Liam had always been perceptive enough to see through her. He'd probably mock her efforts later anyway. Not worth the trouble.

Her message to Sebastian was direct: "Any idea when Liam returns? Need to discuss something important."

Sebastian was buried in paperwork when the notification chimed. His tired expression transformed instantly, a flicker of hope crossing his features.

Rather than replying, he grabbed his phone and practically sprinted to Liam's office.

Inside, Liam sat perched on the edge of his desk, absently swinging a putter. His chiseled features were set in a scowl that could curdle milk.

The door's creak made him glance up irritably. "What?"

Sebastian approached and murmured something that made Liam's eyebrow twitch.

"She texted you. Why the excitement?" Liam's voice dripped with feigned indifference.

Still, he extended a hand for the phone. Sebastian handed it over without hesitation.

Liam's fingers flew across the screen before shoving the device back at Sebastian, who immediately regretted peeking at the response.

"Why do you care when he's coming back?" Liam had typed.

Sebastian felt an instant migraine coming on. Wiping his suddenly damp palms on his trousers, he ventured carefully, "Mr. Blackwood, I'd never address your wife so... informally."

"My wife?" Liam's bitter laugh held years of resentment. "She's practically drafting divorce papers, yet you still treat her like royalty?"

Sebastian could only offer a helpless look. They both knew those words came from pain, not truth.

Olivia blinked at Sebastian's abrupt response, then sighed. Given Liam's obvious disdain for her, this reaction from his subordinate wasn't entirely surprising.

Still, she maintained professionalism: "Apologies for disturbing you, but this concerns Liam directly. It's urgent."

Watching the exchange, Sebastian weighed his options. "Should I say we'll schedule something when you return in a few days?"

Liam typed a terse reply and tossed the phone back. "No need to wait. If it's urgent, tonight."

Sebastian hesitated. "Sir... will you be meeting her personally?"

Liam's glacial stare could have frozen lava. "See her myself? You arranged this, remember. Not me."

Pressure built in Sebastian's chest as he tried to decipher Liam's unreadable expression. With no other options, he braced himself for damage control.

Meanwhile, Olivia arrived early at the designated location. Stepping from her car, she frowned at the exclusive club's facade.

An odd choice for a meeting.

The security guard stopped her at the entrance, explaining the club was closed for a private function. Invitation only.

After ten minutes of waiting with no sign of Sebastian, Olivia's patience wore thin. She dialed his number.

Through muffled background noise, Sebastian's harried voice came through. "Almost there!"

True to his word, he appeared moments later, slightly out of breath.

Olivia acknowledged him with a curt nod, her face carefully blank. That earlier message - questioning why she cared about Liam's return - still stung. They were still married, legally at least.

Noticing her tension, Sebastian cleared his throat. "Mrs. Blackwood, shall we?"

He led her inside to a private lounge, holding the door with exaggerated courtesy.

Olivia froze upon seeing Richard and Catherine inside. Catherine held a fussy toddler dressed in frilly pink, while Richard looked ready to explode.

It had been months since Olivia last saw the child. She marveled at how much Zuri had grown. Children changed so fast.

Her gaze lingered on the little girl, and without thinking, Olivia's hand drifted to her stomach. A pang of longing shot through her. What would her own child look like?

"You came," Catherine said flatly, passing the crying child to a maid. Though her tone was light, her eyes remained cold. "We were starting to think you and Liam had divorced already."

Her sharp laugh grated on Olivia's nerves.

Olivia's expression barely flickered as she greeted them with polite restraint.

Richard shot Catherine a warning look. "Mind your tongue. Even if they separate, Olivia will always be family. She was raised as a Winslow, after all."

Ignoring the backhanded compliment, Olivia turned to Sebastian, eyes narrowed. She typed on her phone: "Why am I here?"

Sebastian leaned close, whispering, "Richard controls the shipping division now. Maybe speak with him?"

A headache pulsed behind Olivia's eyes. Richard had always been difficult, and with Catherine's open hostility, this would be like walking through a minefield.

For a wild moment, Olivia wondered if Liam had orchestrated this whole charade.

Richard cut in impatiently, "Well? I'm busy. State your business."

Taking a steadying breath, Olivia began typing. She outlined the situation concisely: "There's been a misunderstanding between our families. The Whitmores and Blackwoods have collaborated for generations. It makes no sense to ruin that over baseless accusations."

Richard's reaction was volcanic. His face darkened like a thundercloud as he processed her words.

The tension in the room became palpable.

###Chapter 134

Olivia Sinclair stood frozen as Richard Winslow's words struck her like a physical blow. His face twisted in righteous anger, his voice dripping with indignation. "What exactly are you implying? That I'd cowardly shift blame onto the Whitmore family? Olivia, you can't just throw around baseless accusations."

Her brows furrowed in confusion as she studied Richard's earnest expression. If he wasn't responsible, then who had orchestrated this entire mess?

Catherine Winslow let out a mocking laugh, arms crossed over her chest. "How amusing that you're so quick to judge without knowing the full story. What would a mute possibly understand about business dealings?" Her lips curled into a sneer. "With the longstanding feud between the Whitmores and Blackwoods, why are you defending them? Rumor has it you've grown rather... close to them. Planning to marry into the Whitmore family after divorcing Liam, are we?"

The venom in Catherine's words made Olivia's blood run cold. Her fingers curled into fists at her sides.

Sebastian Montgomery stepped forward, his expression darkening. "Madam Winslow, I'd advise you to choose your words more carefully."

Catherine rose abruptly, addressing her husband. "Why are we even wasting our time here? It's obvious Olivia has already made up her mind about us. We should leave before we're falsely accused of something."

Richard stood, his face an unreadable mask as he prepared to exit.

But as he passed Olivia, he stopped dead in his tracks. "I see your game now. You're trying to pin everything on me. Did my brother put you up to this?" His laugh held no humor. "I hadn't even considered the Whitmores' involvement until you brought it up. But now you've given me something to think about. Why should their problems become my responsibility?"

With a derisive snort, Richard stormed out.

Catherine shoved past Olivia with enough force to make her stumble, barely catching herself on the edge of a chair.

Olivia's mind reeled with regret and confusion. Had she been wrong about Richard? If not him, then who? Could it have been Liam all along? Had Liam deliberately sent her into this confrontation as some sort of twisted test?

"Richard!" A deep voice cut through the tension like a knife.

Liam Blackwood appeared in the doorway, his towering frame casting a long shadow. His expression remained infuriatingly unreadable.

Richard whirled around, his face contorted with rage as he jabbed an accusing finger at his brother. "You and your wife set this whole thing up, didn't you? Just because grandfather left you in charge doesn't give you the right to manipulate me like this. Forget it!"

Liam merely smiled, the picture of calm. "Such hostility. I anticipated there might be some confusion, so I returned to clear things up."

"Fine," Richard spat, retaking his seat with barely contained fury. "Let's hear your explanation then."

Catherine, visibly displeased by Liam's arrival, snatched her child from the maid's arms. "The baby's fussy. I'll take her home so she doesn't disturb your little chat."

As she turned to leave, Liam gave a subtle signal. Immediately, several bodyguards blocked her exit. "Leaving so soon?" His smile didn't reach his eyes. "I haven't seen my niece in ages. Stay awhile."

Catherine's face paled. "She's crying. This isn't a good time-"

Before she could finish, the bodyguards closed in, forcing her back into the room with the wailing infant.

Olivia watched the exchange with growing dismay. She made to leave, but Liam caught her wrist in an iron grip.

She struggled against him, her furious glare meeting his impassive one. With her petite frame and tear-filled eyes, she looked more like an angry kitten than a threatening opponent.

Something in Liam's expression softened momentarily before hardening again. "If you truly want to help the Whitmores, you'll stay."

Defeated, Olivia yanked her arm free and retreated to the farthest chair from Liam.

Richard massaged his temples, his patience wearing thin. "Liam, you'd better start explaining what's happening today. I know you hold considerable power, but that doesn't give you license to do as you please."

Liam appeared remarkably at ease despite the tension. He poured a glass of wine and offered it to Richard with an enigmatic smile. "What an interesting choice of words, considering we're family. Blood is thicker than water, after all. Who would harm their own flesh and blood?"

The subtle mockery in his tone made Richard's ears burn with humiliation. Their childhood had been anything but brotherly - Dean had set countless traps for Liam when no adults were watching.

In the Winslow family, sentimental notions of sibling love were naive fantasies. If anything, Richard regretted not being more ruthless in his youth. He often fantasized about having crippled Liam, rendering him as powerless as Olivia.

Liam arched a brow, his voice deceptively light. "We've always had such a wonderful relationship, haven't we? I'd hate to see you get into trouble."

The sarcasm in his emphasis on "wonderful relationship" was unmistakable.

Before Richard could retort, Liam continued. "Consider this a friendly warning. The Whitmores aren't like other families. If you decide to cross them, you'd better be certain you can finish them completely. Otherwise, you're inviting disaster."

Richard's face flushed crimson. "Liam! What nonsense are you spouting? I already told you I knew nothing about this! It could have been a subordinate's mistake. I never intended to provoke the Whitmores!"
###Chapter 135

Liam's words hung heavy in the air as he shot Richard a suspicious glance. "I can see right through you. You're using my name to cause problems with the Whitmores while planning to make me take the fall, aren't you?"

Richard's accusation made Sebastian Montgomery stifle a laugh behind Liam.

The sound only infuriated Richard further, his eyes turning glacial. Nothing angered him more than feeling mocked. Was Liam implying he wasn't clever enough to see through such schemes?

Just as Richard's temper reached its peak, Liam finally stopped smiling and exhaled sharply. "Why are you so quick to blame me? If I truly wanted to cause trouble, do you think you'd still be standing here unharmed?"

Richard's mouth snapped shut, his cheeks flushing crimson. The uncomfortable silence stretched between them as Liam's words sank in. Maybe there was truth in what Liam said. But what exactly was he implying?

Liam drummed his fingers rhythmically against the table, each tap echoing like a heartbeat in the tense room.

"Listen carefully," Liam said, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "You've been betrayed by someone closest to you. Instead of suspecting me at every turn, perhaps you should look closer to home." His piercing gaze locked onto Catherine, conveying volumes without words.

Catherine visibly trembled, her grip on her daughter tightening so hard she nearly dropped the child.

At first, Richard missed the implication. Then realization struck like lightning. He whirled on Catherine, his face darkening with barely contained fury. "You fool! What have you done?"

Catherine's eyes darted nervously before she lifted her chin in defiance. "How dare you accuse me based on his insinuations? After all these years together, raising your child, caring for your mother - is this how you repay my loyalty? I know nothing about business matters! Why point fingers at me?"

Her voice broke as tears streamed down her face. In her distress, she suddenly noticed Olivia standing nearby.

A malicious glint entered Catherine's eyes as she pointed accusingly at Olivia. "Or maybe it's Olivia who's meddling! She's always felt wronged by the Winslows. Lately she's been cozying up to the Whitmores. She's clearly trying to stir up trouble where none existed!"

Richard's expression darkened further as his gaze flickered between Olivia and Catherine.

Suddenly, Olivia gasped in pain and looked down.

Catherine's daughter had wriggled free and was now stabbing Olivia's thigh with a sharp hairpin she'd somehow gotten hold of.

"Stupid mute! Dirty slut!" the child spat with shocking venom, her sweet face contorted with hatred far beyond her years.

Olivia's hands shook with rage - both at the child's cruel words and at Catherine for poisoning such a young mind. Gritting her teeth against the pain, she gently pushed the girl away.

The child fell dramatically to the floor and immediately began wailing.

"You bitch!" Catherine screamed, lunging at Olivia with her hand raised.

But Liam moved faster, catching Catherine's wrist in an iron grip before shoving her away. She stumbled and fell hard, biting back a scream under Liam's murderous glare.

Seeing the blood staining Olivia's dress, Liam's expression turned arctic. He turned to Richard, whose face had gone pale with shock.

"If you refuse to believe your precious wife is behind this," Liam said in a voice like frozen steel, "I can produce the evidence right now."

He took a threatening step forward. "And if you're still blind to the truth, I'll be forced to discuss with the Winslow elders whether someone so easily deceived should remain in charge of our international logistics division."

Without waiting for a response, Liam took Olivia's hand and led her from the room.

Left alone with Catherine, Richard backhanded her across the face with enough force to snap her head back. "They have proof and you're still lying to me? Fine. We're getting divorced!"

The words hit Catherine like a physical blow. Despite her family's wealth, they lacked the Winslow name's prestige. Since marrying Richard, she'd endured endless snubs due to her inferior background.

Margaret Winslow had been a constant thorn in her side, forcing Catherine to tread carefully. Only after Olivia married Liam had Catherine gained some standing - at least she could speak, unlike the mute Olivia.

Now with a daughter, Catherine had finally secured her position. A divorce would destroy everything she'd worked for.

Tears streamed down Catherine's face as she confessed, "It was my cousin's fault! I only found out yesterday. There was an issue with that shipment - he took his team drinking, certain nothing could go wrong after years on the job. But the truck nearly overturned and the goods were damaged."

She grasped Richard's arm desperately. "The Whitmores are longtime clients - they approved the shipment without inspection. No one knows! We just need to blame them and it becomes their problem!"

Richard felt the room spin. He'd once been secretly pleased when Liam married Olivia, believing their children would be mute like her - strengthening his own heir's position. He'd thought Catherine superior in every way.

Now he realized Liam had the true advantage - at least his wife wasn't a complete fool like Catherine.

Richard could barely breathe through his rage. "You idiot! Did you really think this could stay hidden? If Liam knows, how long before everyone knows?"

Catherine blinked in confusion. "But I covered it so well—"

Richard's raised hand fell limply to his side. "Get out of my sight for the next week," he ordered coldly.

As Olivia walked away, Catherine's sobs and Richard's furious shouts followed them down the hall.

Olivia considered asking Liam how he'd connected everything to Catherine, but one look at his stormy expression silenced her.

Once in the car, Liam exchanged a meaningful glance with Sebastian.

Understanding immediately, Sebastian programmed Mercy Hospital's address into the navigation system.
###Chapter 136

Olivia and Liam reached Mercy Hospital in record time, where the attending physician swiftly tended to Olivia's wound.

Though the gash looked alarming, it turned out to be nothing more than a shallow cut—the kind a child might inflict with weak, uncoordinated swings.

Throughout the procedure, Olivia clenched her jaw, her face pinched with discomfort. Pain had always been her weakness.

Nearby, Liam stood with his arms crossed, his sharp gaze fixed on the doctor's every move. He waited until the physician finished before stepping forward to discuss aftercare.

Once alone, Liam approached Olivia. His dark eyes burned with an intensity that made her pulse stutter.

"I never expected you to go this far for the Whitmores," he said, his voice low. "Especially for Alexander."

Olivia caught the edge in his tone but refused to meet his eyes. She signed quickly, dismissing his assumption. She owed William kindness—he had treated her well. Solving this mess was the least she could do.

Liam's jaw tightened. For a moment, it seemed he might say something more, but he swallowed the words.

Silence stretched between them, thick and suffocating.

Finally, Olivia rose, testing her weight on her injured leg. The pain had dulled to a manageable throb. She turned to Liam and signed her thanks, though she still didn’t understand why he had intervened.

Then she pointed toward the door. It was time to leave.

Just as she turned, Liam's hand shot out, gripping her shoulder. His voice was rough with emotion. "Olivia, this might be your last chance. Don’t you have anything to say to me?"

She froze. A storm of emotions raged inside her—regret, longing, resignation. But what was left to say?

For a fleeting moment, she had considered staying. Maybe, given time, she could carve out a place in his heart.

But reality crushed that fragile hope. She could wait—but the life growing inside her couldn’t.

And after everything, she refused to be dependent on Liam’s fleeting mercy. She wouldn’t let her child’s future hang on his whims.

Steeling herself, Olivia signed firmly: If you and Evelyn ever marry, don’t bother sending an invitation.

Liam’s expression darkened. The warmth in his eyes vanished, replaced by icy detachment. "Fine. Then let’s not drag this out. The divorce papers will be ready tomorrow. Two o’clock at city hall. Don’t be late."

Olivia nodded. As Liam strode away, his broad shoulders rigid, an unexpected ache bloomed in her chest. She had thought she’d feel relief. Instead, she felt like part of her had been ripped away.

Clutching her shirt over her heart, she hurried to the restroom. In the mirror, her reflection stared back—pale, shaken, with tears she hadn’t realized were falling.

Meanwhile, Liam stormed to his car, his mood black.

Sebastian caught up just as Liam wrenched the door open. Glancing past him, Sebastian frowned. "Shouldn’t we wait for Ms. Sinclair?"

Liam slammed the door. "Drive."

Sebastian hesitated. "But—"

"I said drive," Liam snapped. "She’s not my concern anymore."

Sebastian swallowed his protest and started the engine.

After a tense silence, he asked, "Where to, sir?"

Liam drummed his fingers on his knee. Then a slow, dangerous smile curved his lips. "How is Evelyn faring at the estate?"

Sebastian hesitated. "Not well, per your instructions."

"Good." Liam leaned back. "Bring her back."

Sebastian’s grip tightened on the wheel, but he didn’t dare argue.

Later, Olivia shared the good news with Alexander.

His shock was palpable. "I never thought you’d go to Liam for help, not after everything. Grandpa always said not to trouble you, but I—"

Olivia cut him off with a reassuring text: You’ve done so much for me. This was nothing. Even if you hadn’t told me, I’d have found out. William is like family. Just focus on his recovery—don’t mention any of this to him.

Alexander exhaled in relief. Then, hesitantly, he asked, "Are you free tonight? Let me treat you to dinner. I owe you."

Olivia agreed. She needed to discuss her future at Whitmore Holdings.

With the divorce looming, she wouldn’t stay in the city. She and her baby needed a fresh start—somewhere safe, far from the chaos. Maybe one day, she’d return.

After finalizing plans, Olivia headed to the prenatal clinic.

Handing over her test results, she held her breath.

The doctor smiled. "Your health has improved, though you’re still fragile. Keep following the regimen. Your baby’s well-being depends on it."

Olivia’s shoulders relaxed. She cradled her stomach and typed: Is the baby okay?

The doctor shook his head. "It’s too early to tell. Regular check-ups are crucial. For now, focus on staying healthy." He scribbled a prescription. "Start these vitamins."

Olivia nodded. As she turned to leave, she collided with someone entering the clinic. Her papers scattered.

Before she could react, a familiar voice rang out. "Olivia?"

Her blood ran cold.

Julian Hawthorne stood before her, his mother Eleanor at his side.

"Sorry," Julian said smoothly. "We were in a hurry for Mother’s appointment. Are you alright?"

Olivia forced a smile and shook her head, clutching the papers tighter behind her back.

Julian’s gaze dropped to her concealed hands. "Let me help you with your prescription. You look unwell—if you need specialists, I can recommend some."

Olivia’s fingers trembled. She took a step back, her heart pounding.

This was trouble.
###Chapter 137

Olivia kept shaking her head as she typed rapidly on her phone screen.

"I'm perfectly fine, just a little cold. And I have matters to attend to here. Thank you for your concern, but I can handle this alone."

With those words typed out, Olivia quickened her pace and practically fled the scene.

Julian watched Olivia's hurried retreat, his warm expression gradually turning impassive.

Eleanor approached silently, her voice barely above a whisper. "You should stay away from that woman. She's nothing but trouble."

Julian gave his mother a questioning look. "What do you mean by that?"

Eleanor's lips curled into a knowing smirk. "Her prescription fell from her bag earlier. It's specifically for pregnant women. Clearly she's expecting, and who knows whose child it is?"

Julian's eyebrows knitted together in thought.

Everyone knew about Olivia's relationship with Liam Blackwood, even though Julian was relatively new in town. Yet something told him Liam wasn't the father.

Given Liam's power and influence, if Olivia were carrying his child, he would have personally ensured she received proper care and accompanied her to all medical appointments.

As the adopted daughter of the Winslow family, Olivia would naturally use such an opportunity to secure her position.

Her secretive behavior raised red flags. Julian suspected the baby might belong to someone else - perhaps Alexander?

A sudden spark of interest lit up Julian's eyes as he considered the possibilities.

Eleanor warned him in a hushed tone, "Remember, avoid women like her at all costs. Besides, with William under our control, we don't need to take unnecessary risks."

Julian shot his mother a disapproving glance. "You're missing the bigger picture. High risk brings high reward. Haven't you noticed? We've been doing well, but Alexander hasn't exactly been welcoming. Once he takes over Whitmore Holdings, we'll become irrelevant."

Bitterness crept into Julian's voice as he continued, "If you'd brought me back to the Hayes family sooner, we'd be in a much stronger position now."

Eleanor's lips trembled slightly, the words caught in her throat as she struggled to respond.

Instead, she adopted a softer tone to placate her son. "Alright. If this is what you want, I'll support your decision."

But Julian's irritation was palpable. "I'll take care of this myself. Stop following me."

Seeing the disappointment in her son's eyes, Eleanor felt a sharp pang in her chest. She had once been the beloved princess of the Whitmore family, but her marriage into the Hawthorne family had led her down a path of hardship.

This was especially true after her husband discovered that William, known for his ruthlessness, wouldn't offer any support simply because Eleanor had married into the Hawthorne family.

After their wedding, Eleanor endured years of abuse from her husband.

When Julian was born, Eleanor longed to return to the Whitmore family, but her husband forbade it.

Over the years, the Whitmore family never inquired about her married life, let alone offered any support or intervention.

Initially, Eleanor resented her husband, but with time and constant manipulation, her anger shifted toward the Whitmore family. If only William had checked in occasionally, provided financial assistance, or secured a decent position for her husband, perhaps her life wouldn't have been so bleak.

These painful thoughts brought tears to Eleanor's eyes.

Just then, her phone rang.

Eleanor hastily wiped her eyes and answered, only to receive urgent news from Mercy Hospital about William's rapidly deteriorating condition that required immediate family presence.

While some distant relatives from the Whitmore family were present, none were close enough to make medical decisions for William.

The only direct relatives available were Eleanor and Alexander, and with Alexander unreachable, the hospital had contacted Eleanor.

Upon hearing the doctor's explanation, an enigmatic smile spread across Eleanor's face. "I'll come to the hospital immediately," she responded. "Have Julian search for Alexander. Call me if you need anything else."

The doctor hesitated but ultimately agreed.

Eleanor suddenly wanted to inform Julian about the situation. But as she reached for her phone, the memory of her son's disapproving expression made her pause.

Determined to prove her capability, Eleanor steeled herself and hurried off.

Time passed quickly, and soon Olivia found herself arriving early at the restaurant for her meeting with Alexander.

A sleek BMW pulled up. Since the incident involving Whitmore Holdings, Alexander had maintained an unusually low profile. He stepped out, his typically stern features softening into a subtle smile when he spotted Olivia, holding a bouquet of pale yellow roses.

Noticing Olivia's slight frown, Alexander quickly explained, "I saw these and thought they were beautiful, so I brought them as a token of appreciation."

Olivia eyed the flowers but gently shook her head, declining them. She typed out a message: "I'm sorry, but I'm allergic to pollen and can't accept these. Thank you for the thought though."

Her response rejected Alexander while preserving his dignity.

Alexander's smile faltered momentarily before he quickly composed himself. "I should have considered that. No worries. My grandfather always told me to treat you like a sister. Let's keep things casual between us."

The word "sister" seemed to relax Olivia slightly, lightening the atmosphere between them.
###Chapter 138

Olivia Sinclair and Alexander Hayes had just finished their lunch. As Olivia gathered her things to leave, Alexander's phone buzzed with an incoming call.

The voice on the other end of the line darkened Alexander's expression instantly.

A cold prickle of unease ran down Olivia's spine. Her instincts screamed that something was wrong. Quickly, she typed out a message: "Is William okay?"

Alexander hesitated before replying, his voice tight. "Just a work emergency. Urgent, but manageable. I won't be able to drive you back."

Understanding, Olivia nodded and gestured for him to go, mouthing "Be careful."

With that, Alexander strode off, his posture rigid with tension. Olivia stepped outside, blinking against the sudden blinding flash of a camera.

Her stomach dropped.

She whipped her head around, scanning the street. There was nothing incriminating about a business lunch, but a single twisted photo could spark a scandal.

Then she spotted him—a man clutching a camera, his face paling as their eyes met.

He bolted.

Olivia wanted to scream "Thief!" to rally the crowd, but her voice failed her. Instead, she sprinted after him, her heels clicking against the pavement.

The man weaved through pedestrians with practiced ease, slipping further away.

Just as despair clawed at her, a figure lunged from the side—Julian Hawthorne.

He tackled the photographer to the ground with brutal efficiency.

Julian didn’t flinch under the shocked stares of bystanders. He wrenched the camera from the man’s grip, his voice sharp. "Delete the photos, or I call the police. You don’t want a lawsuit for invasion of privacy."

Trembling, the man surrendered the camera.

Julian tossed it to Olivia. "He didn’t have time to back anything up."

Olivia deleted the photos immediately, then bowed in gratitude, typing out a message: "Thank you."

Julian shrugged. "I was passing by and saw him acting suspiciously. Didn’t realize he was targeting you." He studied her. "Why would he?"

Olivia hesitated, then typed: "Business lunch with your cousin. Whitmore Holdings is unstable right now. A scandal could be disastrous."

Julian’s expression shifted—understanding, then something calculating.

Before Olivia could react, he added, "You know, you and Alexander would make a good match. My grandfather already approves of you."

Olivia stiffened. She typed firmly: "I’m married. Alexander and I are just friends."

Julian blinked, feigning embarrassment. "Ah, my mistake. I’ve only ever seen you alone."

Olivia forced a polite smile, though irritation simmered beneath. She owed him, but this was crossing a line.

Luckily, Julian suddenly excused himself, claiming an urgent matter.

Relief flooded her.

The moment Julian slid into his car, his pleasant facade vanished. He pulled out his phone, scrolling through photos—Olivia and Alexander, their heads close together, their expressions intimate.

His lips curled. Perfect.

At the hospital, chaos reigned.

Julian slipped into the crowd of weeping relatives, his face a mask of concern.

Eleanor Hawthorne sat with red-rimmed eyes. Spotting Julian, she clutched his arm like a lifeline, her fingers digging in.

Julian knew those weren’t tears of grief.

Eleanor whispered, "He’s in a vegetative state. No one knows if he’ll wake up."

Julian’s eyes widened. "You did this?"

Before she could answer, Alexander stormed in, flanked by bodyguards.

Julian jerked his arm free, stepping back.

Eleanor barely had time to register the betrayal before Alexander’s icy voice cut through the room.

"Explain this."

Eleanor’s face crumpled. "How dare you accuse me? He’s my father!"

Alexander didn’t flinch. "The doctor said you insisted on being alone with him after surgery. Then his oxygen tube was mysteriously disconnected. Now he’s comatose." His voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "What did you do?"

Eleanor struck his chest, sobbing. "After everything I’ve done for you—"

Alexander caught her wrist, his grip unyielding. "You abandoned this family before I was born. Grandfather nearly died from the stress. Don’t pretend to care now."

The room held its breath.

Julian watched, his smirk hidden in the shadows.

This was far from over.
###Chapter 139

Eleanor's trembling subsided, her sobs growing quieter as guilt and fear consumed her.

Julian cursed "fool" under his breath.

Desperate to divert attention from his mother's guilty expression, Julian dropped to his knees with a sharp thud that echoed through the room. He faced the direction of William's ward and repeatedly pressed his forehead against the cold floor in exaggerated submission.

Alexander's expression darkened, his brow furrowing as he watched with silent contempt.

Julian then launched into a dramatic display, wailing loudly. He crawled on his knees toward Alexander and clutched at the hem of his trousers, his desperation palpable.

"Alexander, if it's true that my mother committed such a vile act, then she's worse than an animal. Casting her out would be justified," Julian pleaded, his voice thick with emotion. "But I beg you—investigate thoroughly. My mother is timid. She wouldn't even harm an insect, let alone her own father."

His performance was convincing, tugging at the heartstrings of those present, even drawing tears from some.

Yet Alexander remained unmoved, his gaze steady. "Why the urgency, Julian? I haven't accused her outright. I simply wish to speak with her."

Julian's eyes darted nervously as he continued his theatrical sobs. "I know you resent us for returning to the Whitmore family. You think we don't belong here. But I don't want anything from you—not the estate, not the company. Just show us mercy. Keeping us here is like having two stray dogs in your home."

The murmurs in the room grew louder.

"How could anyone be so cruel? Accusing a woman of killing her own father!"

"Maybe he's using this as an excuse to drive them out."

Whispers spread among the Whitmore family members. Many had long harbored grievances against Alexander but lacked the courage to confront him—until now.

They helped Julian to his feet, and one man stepped forward boldly. "We're family. It's one thing to ignore us, but this? Your own aunt and cousin—how can you be so heartless? Everyone has seen how tirelessly they've cared for William while you barely visit. If they wanted him dead, they would have acted long ago. Or is it you who can't wait for him to die so you can take everything and cast us all aside?"

Alexander's fury erupted. His fist connected with the man's face before anyone could react.

The man didn't even try to defend himself.

Julian, however, seized the moment to escalate the chaos. Covering his face, he cried out dramatically, "Alexander, why attack me? If hitting me makes you feel better, go ahead!"

The scene was captured on video and uploaded online, spreading like wildfire.

Unaware of the truth, the public fell for Julian's act, flooding Alexander's social media with hateful comments. Some even called for a boycott of Whitmore Holdings' products, demanding his resignation.

Meanwhile, Olivia remained oblivious to the online storm.

Tomorrow, she would officially be single again—a milestone that should have brought relief. Yet, restlessness consumed her. Memories of her time with the Blackwood family resurfaced, vivid and unrelenting.

Their wedding day stood out most.

Liam had been visibly unhappy, his expression cold and distant.

Olivia had considered calling it off.

A careless remark she'd made had somehow reached Henry, who then pressured Liam into the marriage.

The ceremony had been lavish, attended mostly by Blackwood family members.

Olivia had been ready to speak to Henry, to stop everything if Liam refused.

But when she approached him, Liam's response had been icy. He gripped her chin, his eyes devoid of warmth. "Still not satisfied? What more do you want? Should I vow to love only you forever?"

His mocking words haunted her.

The next day, on what should have been the happiest day of her life, Olivia found herself in tears.

She couldn't understand why happiness eluded her.

Throughout the ceremony, whispers and jeers had circled her.

Some claimed she was nothing but a mute unworthy of Liam, accusing her of seducing him.

They were right about one thing—Olivia was mute.

Unable to defend herself, she endured the mockery in silence.

After the ceremony, she sought Liam out, only to find him with bodyguards, beating those who had mocked her most viciously.

His voice had been deadly calm. "Who do you think you are to speak of her like that?"

From then on, the taunts lessened.

Olivia had felt conflicted then.

Now, she felt the same.

She didn't hate Liam. But perhaps she should have walked away sooner. Now, even friendship seemed impossible.

She tossed and turned all night, her mind in turmoil.

At six in the morning, a knock sounded at her door.

When she didn't answer, the visitor called louder. "Mrs. Blackwood? We're from the Blackwood family."

Olivia's breath hitched. Liam's people?

Why so early? Did he fear she'd change her mind? A pang of sadness struck her.

She opened the door to find several uniformed bodyguards waiting. They gestured politely for her to follow.

As she approached the car, unease settled in her chest.

This wasn't Liam's usual vehicle.

Still, she climbed in.

Instead of heading to city hall, the car turned toward the Blackwood mansion.

Olivia's pulse quickened.

When she entered the living room, Margaret and Catherine sat waiting, their expressions grim.

Her stomach dropped.

Something was wrong.
###Chapter 140

Olivia Sinclair felt a cold wave of terror wash over her. Every instinct screamed at her to flee.

She took several hurried steps backward, only to find her escape route cut off by a wall of bodyguards. There was no way out now.

Catherine Winslow watched Olivia's pale face with barely concealed satisfaction before turning back to Margaret Winslow. "Richard is determined to divorce me now," she continued dramatically. "It's terrifying for both me and our child. What will become of us? The media will destroy Richard's reputation. Margaret, your granddaughter calls you 'Grandma' every day—you must intervene! I can't imagine what I've done to make Olivia hate me enough to tear our family apart."

As she spoke, Catherine shot Olivia a venomous glare.

Olivia understood immediately. The recent incident had driven a wedge between Richard and Catherine.

She didn't know how they had tried to resolve things, but clearly, it had escalated to the point of divorce. And now, Catherine was blaming her.

Margaret's expression darkened as she listened, her fury palpable. "Olivia, come here!" she snapped, her voice sharp with barely restrained anger.

Olivia steadied herself as she approached, typing with deliberate precision. "I'm aware of their situation, but I'm not the cause. If Richard is furious, I'm sure Catherine knows exactly why."

A flicker of guilt crossed Catherine's face, but Margaret ignored it.

She stood abruptly and struck Olivia across the cheek.

"You have no right interfering in their marriage!" Margaret hissed. "Don't play innocent. With Liam pushing for divorce, you're just stirring trouble. Yes, Catherine made mistakes, but she's still family. You're meddling for the Whitmores' benefit!"

Margaret's voice dripped with contempt. "Olivia, this is disgraceful. I know all about your affairs. As long as you're legally married to Liam, I have every right to discipline you."

Olivia clutched her stinging cheek, her heart sinking.

Footsteps approached.

She turned to see a bodyguard advancing, gripping a thick baton.

Her back slick with sweat, Olivia stared at Margaret in disbelief. She typed frantically.

"You're condoning violence? That's illegal! Do you really think I won't call the police?"

Margaret laughed, the sound harsh and mocking. "Go ahead. Let's see who they side with—me or you. Even if Liam showed up now, he wouldn't lift a finger to help you. This is a family matter. If you can't behave, I'll make you."

Years of resentment had festered in Margaret, and now, with revenge within reach, she wouldn't let it slip away—even if she knew, deep down, it was wrong.

Morality no longer mattered to her.

Meanwhile, Catherine wiped away her crocodile tears and smirked. She handed her daughter to a nearby maid. "Take her outside to play. Things here might get... messy."

As Olivia watched the scene unfold, despair settled heavily in her chest.

Elsewhere, Liam Blackwood arrived at city hall on time, waiting for Olivia at the entrance.

An hour passed with no sign of her. His patience wore thin.

He hadn't come early to spite her—his anger had simply taken over. If Olivia wanted a divorce so badly, maybe he should just give it to her.

He sent message after message, but none were answered.

Olivia hadn't shown up, and Liam's frown deepened. What was she playing at? Did she think she could dictate the terms of their relationship?

Was their marriage just a game to her?

Furious, he dialed her number again.

Just then, Olivia's phone rang from inside the mansion, startling the bodyguards.

Margaret snatched it, freezing when she saw the caller ID. Liam was the last person she expected.

Olivia realized who it was and tried to struggle, but she couldn't speak, and they didn't understand sign language. Helpless, she watched as Catherine took the phone.

Catherine's eyes gleamed with determination as she whispered instructions to a bodyguard.

The man hesitated. "Are you sure about this?"

Catherine scowled. "With Margaret and me here, what's there to fear? If there's trouble, we'll handle it."

Reassured, the bodyguard took the phone.

Liam's jaw clenched when the call finally connected. "Olivia, are you joking?"

Instead of her voice, a man answered. "Sorry, Olivia can't make it today. She's busy."

For a moment, Liam was stunned. His expression remained cold, but his fist tightened. "And you are?" he demanded, voice icy.

The man on the line sounded amused. "A close friend. We're heading to a resort today. She asked me to tell you she's free tomorrow."

Liam's fury simmered, though his brows remained furrowed. "Tomorrow? That's supposed to be a day off."

The man scoffed. "What does it matter? She's not coming today. That's all you need to know. She doesn't want to see you."

Liam let out a humorless laugh, his eyes darkening. "A resort, huh? Which one?"

The man carelessly dropped the name before hanging up.

After the call, Liam's anger had dulled, replaced by a chilling calm. He turned to Sebastian Montgomery. "Drive. We're going back to the mansion."

The resort the man mentioned belonged to the Blackwood family.

An uneasy feeling gripped Liam. Had Olivia gotten herself into trouble again?

Meanwhile, as the bodyguard hung up after feeding Liam lies, Olivia's last hope vanished.

For the first time, she hated her inability to speak. Why was she mute? Why couldn't she defend herself?

She was utterly powerless.

Catherine watched Olivia's despair with cruel satisfaction.

She had noticed Liam's protectiveness toward Olivia that day in the chamber.

It was undeniable—and Catherine couldn't stand it.

Her marriage was supposed to be perfect. How could Olivia, someone she looked down on, have a husband better than hers?

"Let's get this over with," Catherine said coldly.

The bodyguard raised the baton.

Olivia braced herself.

(To be continued...)
###Chapter 141

Margaret gestured sharply to the security team. "Proceed. But avoid her face. Focus on her legs. Since she's already handicapped, let's make sure she won't be a burden to society."

Olivia's tears streamed down her face, her body trembling with raw terror.

Pinned against the cold marble floor, the sharp cramps in her abdomen made her complexion turn ghostly white.

With desperate hand motions, Olivia tried to convey her pregnancy to Margaret. This wasn't just assault - it was premeditated murder.

But Margaret only frowned in confusion at the frantic gestures.

Catherine leaned in with a venomous whisper. "Look at that defiance. She's probably cursing you with every breath."

This ignited Margaret's fury. She strode forward in her designer heels, grabbing fistfuls of Olivia's hair and yanking violently.

Olivia gasped in pain, lifting her head to glare at her mother-in-law with fiery determination.

Margaret sneered. "Curse me all you want. You're getting what you deserve. You never belonged in the Blackwood family. If you hadn't manipulated Henry to force Liam into marrying you—"

She tightened her grip. "My son had far better options than a mute. Do you know the humiliation he endures? And you repay him by shamelessly flaunting yourself with other men? You're disgusting!"

Olivia's lips parted but only produced strange, guttural sounds.

With a disgusted shove, Margaret released her. "Beat her!" she commanded coldly.

The first blow from the baton nearly made Olivia black out from the agony.

Through the haze of pain, one thought crystallized - she had to protect her baby at all costs.

Curling into a protective ball, Olivia shielded her abdomen with both arms.

Catherine's eyes narrowed with sudden understanding. Her voice turned icy. "Forget the legs. Aim for her stomach!"

Margaret blinked at Catherine's sudden cruelty but didn't intervene.

Terror seized Olivia as she met Catherine's malicious gaze. How could another mother be so heartless?

As the baton raised for the killing strike, a voice like thunder cracked through the room. "Enough!"

Margaret spun to see Liam striding in, his expression murderous. She forced a smile, guilt flashing in her eyes. "Liam! What brings you home so early?"

His gaze locked onto Olivia's battered form. "If I hadn't returned, you'd be facing murder charges."

"Murder?" Margaret scoffed. "Don't be dramatic. Olivia caused trouble again. She nearly destroyed Richard and Catherine's marriage!"

"I know," Liam said coldly.

Margaret recoiled. "You knew? Then why didn't you stop her?"

Ignoring her, Liam turned his scorching glare on Catherine, who paled visibly.

"Because I was the one who informed Richard about Catherine sabotaging his international shipments. Drunk driving on the highway? One mistake could've meant prison."

Margaret's face drained of color as the truth sank in.

Catherine had lied. This wasn't some petty dispute - it was criminal negligence that could've ruined them all.

Margaret swayed on her feet before whirling on Catherine. "You deceitful viper!"

Tears sprang to Catherine's eyes. "I never meant to lie! It's all Olivia's fault! If she hadn't interfered—"

"Enough!" Liam cut her off. "By that logic, I'm equally guilty since I exposed your crimes. Should I kneel for punishment too?"

Catherine shook her head frantically. "No! That's not what I—"

Margaret grasped Liam's arm pleadingly. "I only wanted to protect you. I know you're considering divorce. Olivia keeps causing trouble. Why not end this farce now?"

Liam shook her off violently. "Protect me? Or your precious reputation? You've always hated Olivia. This was never about me."

Margaret's mouth fell open, wounded. "After everything I've done for you—"

"You've done nothing but interfere," Liam said coldly as he gently lifted Olivia. Without another glance at his mother, he turned to leave.

His final words hung in the air like a death sentence. "My life would be better if you stopped 'caring' altogether."
###Chapter 142

Margaret Winslow's eyes burned with fury as she watched Liam Blackwood walk away.

Her hands trembled with rage before she snatched the nearest vase and hurled it to the floor, shattering it into pieces.

Catherine Winslow, the instigator of the conflict, flinched at the sudden outburst.

Seeing Margaret's stormy expression, Catherine cautiously approached. "Don't blame Liam," she murmured soothingly. "It must be Olivia Sinclair whispering lies in his ear. That's the only reason he'd treat you this way."

She placed a comforting hand on Margaret's shoulder. "You're his mother. Deep down, he loves you."

Margaret's voice cracked with sorrow. "The way he looked at me... as if I meant nothing to him anymore."

A sly glint flickered in Catherine's eyes. "Honestly, his behavior was unacceptable. You've only ever wanted what's best for him, and this is how he repays you?" She sighed dramatically. "If Richard were in his place, he would never treat you like this."

Margaret blinked, her tears pausing as she studied Catherine with suspicion. "Isn't Richard about to divorce you? And yet you still defend him?"

Catherine forced a sheepish smile. "We've had our misunderstandings, but we're still together. I'm not giving up on him." Her voice softened pleadingly. "I need your help. Think of your granddaughter—she's so young. What would happen to her if I left?"

Margaret massaged her temples, her tone icy. "I'll help you this time. But if you drag Richard into trouble again, don't expect mercy from me."

Catherine nodded eagerly, her expression submissive. "I'll follow your advice, I promise."

Margaret exhaled slowly, her gaze drifting to the doorway, darkening with resentment. "You're right. Richard would never treat me this way." Her lips twisted bitterly. "Liam may be the brightest, but his sharp mind makes him impossible to control. He's never been as obedient as Richard, not even as a child."

Catherine hid a triumphant smirk.

Meanwhile, Olivia was barely conscious, her body wracked with pain. Liam shoved her into the car without gentleness.

The agony intensified, draining the color from her face as tremors wracked her frame.

Sebastian Montgomery hesitated, about to intervene, but one glance at Liam's glacial expression made him hold his tongue.

"Olivia," Liam growled, his voice taut with suppressed fury. "Even if they had beaten you to death today, you still wouldn’t have called me, would you?"

He snatched her phone and forcefully pressed the power button three times. Instantly, his own phone rang.

Liam had programmed an emergency alert into Olivia’s phone—knowing she might be in danger but unable to speak, he had set himself as her sole emergency contact.

Olivia refused to meet his gaze, her silence answer enough.

She had never intended to reach out to him. Not when their divorce was imminent. Why burden him again?

"Still refusing to speak to me?" Liam's irritation flared as she deliberately turned away.

He seized her chin, forcing her to face him.

Olivia's vision blurred from pain. Weakly, she tried to push his hand away but lacked the strength. Tears spilled down her cheeks, landing warm against his skin.

The sight of her silent sobbing made Liam's stern expression falter.

Her lips parted, but only faint whimpers escaped.

Liam leaned closer.

Her fingers weakly clutched his wrist as she whispered, "Liam... Liam."

For a heartbeat, he froze.

Then, without hesitation, he swept her into his arms, slammed the car door, and barked at Sebastian, "Drive to Mercy Hospital. Now."

That tone—it was the same way Olivia had called his name when she first came to the Blackwood family as a child.

Back then, Liam had felt nothing but indifference toward the unexpected girl in his life.

But over time, he realized his initial judgment had been wrong.

Liam had never been good with words, so he showed his care by stepping in whenever Olivia was bullied—his way of making amends.

In return, despite her damaged vocal cords, Olivia had strained to say his name.

Annoyed by her effort, he had snapped, "Don't force yourself to please me. Your voice sounds terrible."

The hurt in her eyes had struck him like a blade.

For a moment, he almost chased after her to apologize. But something stopped him. Maybe it was better if she stayed away from someone like him.

After that day, Olivia never called his name in that tone again. Instead, she watched him with wide, wary eyes—like a frightened deer.

Liam told himself she must be afraid of him.

Later, Henry Winslow passed the leadership of Blackwood Enterprises to Liam.

The responsibility left him with even less time. A man in his position couldn’t afford weakness.

Back then, Liam was still young, barely able to protect himself, much less anyone else. Enemies lurked, waiting for any misstep to tear him down.

The weight of it all made him colder, more distant. His relationship with Olivia only worsened.

Every time she frowned, he wondered if she saw him as a monster.

Then Natalie Bennett introduced Daniel Bennett into Olivia’s life.

Liam, as a man, recognized Daniel’s feelings for her. Natalie had noticed too. But Olivia, oblivious as ever, remained clueless.

The breaking point came when Henry gave Liam an ultimatum—marry Olivia or vow to protect her as a brother for life.

Liam chose marriage. He couldn’t bear to let her go.

Perhaps Olivia resented him for it. The bright, cheerful girl she once was vanished overnight, replaced by someone cautious and sorrowful.

Deep down, Liam tormented himself—was being married to him truly such a terrible fate for her?

He had wondered for years but never dared to ask.

Irritated, he craved a cigarette. But glancing down at Olivia, unconscious in his arms, he restrained himself.

(To be continued...)
###Chapter 143

Olivia's entire body throbbed with pain as consciousness returned.

The hospital room was empty except for a few nurses attending to her. Liam was conspicuously absent.

One nurse noticed Olivia's awakening and rushed to her side. "Miss Sinclair, you must remain still. Your baby is perfectly safe. You're extremely lucky - the accident didn't harm your child at all."

Confusion swirled through Olivia's mind.

The mention of her baby and the realization that Liam had brought her to the hospital sent panic coursing through her veins.

She began gesturing frantically, demanding to know Liam's whereabouts.

Fortunately, the nurses Liam had assigned were proficient in sign language. "Mr. Blackwood had urgent business to attend to," one explained calmly.

A cold dread settled in Olivia's stomach. This wasn't a nightmare. Liam had indeed brought her to the hospital, which meant he knew about her pregnancy.

She'd always known this moment would come, but not so soon. Emotionally unprepared, she wondered about Liam's reaction. His absence spoke louder than words.

Overcome with anxiety, Olivia threw off the blankets and attempted to leave. The nurses immediately restrained her.

"Miss Sinclair, this is serious," one said sternly. "You're in no condition to be moving. You need complete bed rest."

Olivia's face paled as her terrified eyes darted around the unfamiliar environment. Too much had happened too quickly. Her nerves were frayed, and she desperately needed to escape to safety. She was exhausted from being at others' mercy.

The thought of Liam forcing her to terminate the pregnancy was unbearable. What power did she have against him?

In desperation, Olivia grabbed her IV line, threatening to rip it out.

The nurses gasped in shock.

Tears streamed down Olivia's face as she signed with fierce determination, demanding to be released.

But even after leaving the ward, escaping the hospital proved impossible. She was sedated and returned to her room.

This time, she found herself alone.

As the nurses filed out, Olivia heard the ominous click of the lock.

Despair overwhelmed her. She felt like a caged bird.

"That's essentially what happened, Mr. Blackwood," Sebastian reported. "But I assure you, no harm came to her. While sedated, the doctors conducted thorough examinations. Aside from emotional distress, she's perfectly healthy."

Liam's expression darkened. "She woke up and immediately tried to flee?"

"Yes," Sebastian confirmed. "Her first question was whether you'd brought her here. It seems she still cares for you. Her current behavior likely stems from fear. Perhaps—"

Sebastian hesitated, studying Liam's mood before continuing, "Perhaps your presence might comfort her."

Liam scoffed. "She knows I brought her here, yet she's desperate to leave, risking her health. Do you truly believe my presence would bring her comfort?"

Sebastian fell silent.

Liam's face hardened. "Haven't I made it clear I want no reports about her? I fulfilled my obligation by getting her medical care. She's obsessed with divorcing me and didn't even consider asking for my help when captured and bullied. Why should I care about her now?"

Sebastian sighed quietly, knowing Liam's words were hollow. "The doctor mentioned needing to discuss something important regarding her condition. Should I arrange—"

"Enough!" Liam cut him off sharply. "I don't want to hear another word about Olivia. Is that clear?"

"Crystal," Sebastian replied, frustration evident in his tone.

Liam had left shortly after bringing Olivia to the hospital. Though his actions suggested indifference, his earlier instruction for the doctor to keep Sebastian informed betrayed his true concern.

Exasperation washed over Sebastian. The stubbornness of both Liam and Olivia was maddening.

Olivia slept through the day and night. When she awoke, she felt significantly better.

Her attitude had shifted. She became cooperative, diligently following her treatment plan and taking meals and medications on schedule.

Determined, Olivia resolved to prioritize her health regardless of Liam's intentions about their future or the baby. Her well-being came first.

During quiet moments, Olivia's gaze would drift to the window, lost in thought.

The world outside appeared calm, but inside Olivia, uncertainty gnawed at her.

Then she spotted a familiar figure entering the hospital. Her heart pounded.

It was Liam.

Olivia jumped to her feet. Regardless of Liam's thoughts, she needed answers.

She rushed to the door and banged on it urgently. It soon opened to reveal the same group of nurses. "Do you need something? We can assist with anything except discharge requests."

Olivia shook her head, signing frantically that she'd seen Liam and needed to speak with him.

The nurses exchanged uncertain glances before finally nodding.

Soon, a message arrived. Liam had agreed to meet. He instructed Olivia to wait in her room until someone escorted her to the doctor's office.

With thirty minutes until the appointment, Olivia's impatience grew. She signed that her matter was urgent and requested to go immediately.

The nurse, unable to dissuade her, relented. They arrived at the medical center just as Liam was deep in conversation with the doctor.

Olivia reached for the door handle but paused, deciding to wait.

The heated argument inside was impossible to ignore.

"Are you absolutely certain she's pregnant?" Liam's voice carried clearly.

"Yes, the tests confirm it," the doctor replied. "Mr. Blackwood, how do you wish to proceed?"

"If she wants to stay, she'll have to terminate the pregnancy," Liam stated firmly.

Olivia's heart plummeted. A chill ran through her veins as she staggered slightly, struggling to maintain composure.

From Olivia's perspective, Liam was taking the easy way out, shirking responsibility by suggesting abortion.

Her hand instinctively moved to her stomach as fierce determination flooded her being. She would never give up her child so easily.
###Chapter 144

The murmurs in the physician's office gradually faded. It seemed Liam would be stepping out soon.

Olivia abruptly tensed, gesturing to her nurse that she felt unwell and needed to return to her private suite immediately.

The pallor of Olivia's complexion made her claim believable.

The caregiver hesitated briefly. His primary directive was safeguarding Olivia's wellbeing above all else. "Very well, let's get you back," he conceded, extending his arm to guide her forward.

When Liam finally emerged from his consultation, the hallway stood deserted. His brow furrowed as he turned to Sebastian. "Find out what occurred."

Sebastian returned swiftly with answers. "The staff reported your wife became suddenly ill and retired to her quarters. She's requested postponing your meeting."

Liam chuckled darkly. "First desperate to see me, now suddenly indisposed."

"Perhaps she's genuinely unwell," Sebastian ventured cautiously. "Since we're here, shall we pay her a visit?"

Liam's expression hardened. "What purpose would that serve? It's obvious she's avoiding me."

Rubbing his temples, Liam abruptly changed subjects. "Handle that personnel matter we discussed earlier. I was too occupied during the medical consultation. Inform the employee I understand her deception regarding her pregnancy to secure employment. However, if she insists on remaining, I'll have no choice but to explore alternatives."

"Understood," Sebastian acknowledged with a nod.

The crisis had erupted days prior when a department head unexpectedly resigned. The position's critical nature demanded immediate filling.

In their haste, HR neglected thorough background verification.

Now, as a crucial initiative launched, the new hire—a woman—revealed her three-month pregnancy, demanding medical leave despite having joined barely a week earlier.

While Blackwood Enterprises maintained strict policies against pregnancy discrimination, this situation presented unique complications.

During interviews, HR had explicitly outlined the project's demands and directly inquired about pregnancy status, receiving firm denials.

The employee now stubbornly clung to her role while threatening legal action if terminated.

The responsible HR officer already faced disciplinary measures.

Navigating this precarious situation required delicate handling.

Liam sensed resolution wouldn't come easily.

The timing couldn't have been worse.

When Sebastian received updates from his team, his face darkened. Approaching Liam urgently, he reported, "Sir, complications have arisen. The woman has miscarried."

Liam's demeanor turned grave. Without hesitation, he quickened his pace toward the exit.

The physician, having finalized his notes, emerged to find Liam already departed. He sighed quietly. He'd intended to discuss Olivia's pregnancy with Liam.

Mercy Hospital served primarily the Blackwood family, employing him specifically for their needs.

The physician understood the implications of Olivia's condition and had deliberately withheld the information, intending to inform Liam first. Now, he'd have to await Liam's next visit.

"Excuse me." A feminine voice interrupted his thoughts.

Turning, he saw Catherine wearing a practiced smile.

"Is Olivia receiving treatment here?" Catherine inquired.

Recognizing Catherine but recalling Liam's explicit orders—no visitors except himself—the physician adjusted his spectacles. "She is indeed here, but currently not accepting visitors. You'll need Mr. Blackwood's authorization."

Catherine's smile faltered. Seek Liam's permission? She knew that avenue was closed.

"Liam's preoccupied with business," Catherine persisted. "As his sister-in-law, I'm practically family. Surely checking on an ailing relative is appropriate? May I at least observe from outside her door?"

The physician remained impassive. "She's hospitalized due to injuries you inflicted. While I won't involve myself in family disputes, my duty is protecting my patient from further harm."

Catherine's eyes widened. She hadn't anticipated Liam sharing those details. What would people think now?

Color drained from her face before angry crimson replaced it, her pleasant facade crumbling as she threatened, "You realize Liam doesn't yet control the entire Blackwood empire. Are you certain you wish to make an enemy of me?"

The physician dismissed her with a wave. "Unless there's medical necessity, I must ask you to leave. My surgical schedule demands my attention."

Gritting her teeth, Catherine stormed away reluctantly.

Yet surrender wasn't in her nature. Something was amiss with Olivia—why else would Liam enforce such secrecy?

Exiting the hospital, Catherine issued sharp instructions: "Investigate that physician's personal vulnerabilities. I refuse to be thwarted by some hired medic."

Olivia spent the day consumed by dread, paradoxically relieved by Liam's absence.

Yet as hours passed without his appearance, her anxiety intensified.

She found herself almost wishing he'd materialize so she could confront him directly.

Growing suspicious of the medications administered, Olivia began resisting openly. When offered sedatives, she feigned compliance before rushing to vomit them up.

After agonizing deliberation, Olivia seized a moment of inattention to contact Alexander.

Alexander, having just managed online rumors, grew instantly alarmed at Olivia's distressed message.

"What's happening? Where are you? Are you safe? Send coordinates—I'll alert authorities immediately," he responded urgently.

Olivia typed hastily: "No police. That would only warn them."

Still legally married to Liam, Olivia knew he'd circumvent any official intervention.
###Chapter 145

Olivia's fingers trembled as she typed the urgent message to Alexander. She needed to escape Mercy Hospital immediately.

Alexander didn't ask questions. His immediate concern was her location and wellbeing.

"Consider it done," he replied instantly. "I'll get you out safely."

Reading his reassuring words, Olivia felt some of the tension leave her shoulders.

Over the next few days, they carefully crafted an escape plan.

Fortunately, Liam hadn't placed Olivia under full confinement.

As long as she followed her treatment regimen and took her medications, she enjoyed limited freedom within the ward. But the doors remained locked.

Some days, Olivia felt like a prized bird in a gilded cage. She burned with questions for Liam. Yet each time she requested to see him, the staff claimed he was overwhelmed with business matters.

Olivia knew better. This wasn't about work. He was avoiding her - avoiding the pregnancy.

Then, without warning, her lead physician appeared. His visits only occurred for significant developments.

Olivia's pulse quickened at the sight of him. She rose from her chair, instinctively retreating toward the corner.

Using her phone's voice function, she asked why he'd come.

The doctor's face was unreadable, caught between professional detachment and personal discomfort. Finally, he spoke. "Olivia, we need to discuss your pregnancy."

Her stomach dropped. Her fingers flew across the screen: "Did Liam send you?"

The physician hesitated before nodding.

Tears threatened as she typed with shaking hands: "What does he want?"

The doctor cleared his throat. "Let me explain the situation. Your health isn't optimal for pregnancy. And with your impending divorce... raising a child alone would be challenging. Given your condition, could you truly provide this child with a good life?"

Olivia's reply was fierce: "I'll give my child everything. Liam won't be burdened. I'll sign any agreement. This baby is my choice, and I won't be pressured into termination."

She maintained outward composure, but fear coiled in her chest.

She knew Liam too well. When he decided something, nothing could sway him.

This conversation wasn't about her choice. It was preparation for what was coming.

Yet Olivia couldn't surrender. This was her child. She'd felt its tiny heartbeat.

The doctor's expression darkened. "Be realistic. In your condition, the fetus wouldn't survive to term anyway."

Olivia's world tilted. What was he implying?

Terror flashed in her eyes as she grabbed the doctor's arm, silently demanding answers.

Avoiding her gaze, he admitted, "The treatments these past days... they were modified. You wouldn't want the child to suffer, would you?"

The room spun. Olivia's hands shook violently. She'd anticipated Liam's schemes, but never this cruelty.

Rage and grief choked her. Tears streamed down her face as she swept everything off the nearby table in a silent scream.

The doctor extended a document with pity. "This consent form is mercy. Continuing would only prolong suffering."

Exhausted, Olivia collapsed to the floor, cradling her stomach. The weight of Liam's betrayal crushed her spirit.

Wracked with guilt, the doctor fled the room.

Outside, a younger colleague intercepted him. "You're really doing this? If Mr. Blackwood finds out-"

"What choice do I have?" the older man snapped. "Catherine has my family in her grasp. I want no part in their war. Once she signs, we're done. Any investigation won't touch us."

The younger doctor frowned. "Did you actually alter the medications?"

"Of course not!" The lead physician paled. "That's Liam's heir! He's desperate for children - keeps asking if she can conceive again. I just needed to scare her. Now that I've spoken to Olivia, we must proceed."

Olivia didn't know how long she'd been crying. Her hand rested on her flat stomach with growing dread. Had the tiny heartbeat stopped? The thought paralyzed her.

She stared at the consent form. Maybe the doctor was right. Maybe the baby was already gone.

But accepting that felt impossible.

Continuing the pregnancy seemed cruel, but letting go was unbearable.

Since Henry's death, Olivia had felt utterly alone in the world. This child would have been family - proof she wasn't completely solitary.

She knew if she terminated now, she'd never have another chance at motherhood.

Just then, Alexander's message arrived. The escape was set for tomorrow. Everything was arranged.

Olivia had once dreamed of fleeing to coastal Newport, raising her child by the sea in peaceful solitude.

Now she only felt crushing isolation.

Her phone buzzed again, but she lacked the energy to look.

Suddenly, the desire to run evaporated.

Escape wouldn't change her fate of being Liam's pawn.

When the ringing persisted, she saw Alexander's name.

With resolve, she declined the call and typed: "Plans changed. I'm staying. Thank you for your help, Mr. Hayes."
###Chapter 146

Olivia texted Alexander: "Then it hit me. I don't need to run anymore. I'm okay now. Everything's fine."

Alexander instantly recognized the hidden pain in Olivia's message. His fingers flew across the screen. "Olivia, what's wrong? Talk to me."

Tears threatened to spill as Olivia fought to maintain composure. With trembling hands, she typed: "I'm fine, just tired. Need rest. Don't worry about me, Mr. Hayes. You've got enough on your plate."

The moment she sent it, Olivia powered off her phone. She drew her knees to her chest, burying her face in them. Silent sobs wracked her body.

She hated this weakness but felt powerless to stop it. No one else should bear her burdens.

With the troublemakers gone, Liam felt momentary relief.

Sebastian observed Liam's tension. "Mr. Blackwood, the doctors report Olivia's condition has improved significantly. Perhaps a hospital visit would benefit you both."

Liam rubbed his temples, eyes shut tight. "She clearly doesn't want to see me. Why force it? Has she asked for me even once?"

Truthfully, she had - just days ago.

Liam had cleared his schedule only to be stood up without explanation.

Sometimes he wondered if his leniency made Olivia take him for granted.

Sebastian cleared his throat. "There might be a misunderstanding. The nurses say she stares out the window all day, looking devastated."

Liam's icy gaze snapped to Sebastian. "You know exactly why."

Sebastian fell silent. He did know.

Margaret, Richard and Catherine had always resented Olivia.

Meanwhile, Blackwood Enterprises' rivals had become unusually coordinated, creating major problems.

The pregnant manager incident had nearly ruined Liam. Next time, he might not be so lucky.

Despite their strained relationship, Olivia remained his legal wife.

Sebastian sighed. "Maybe if you explained the pressures you're facing..."

Liam swirled his wine, emotions unreadable. "She blames me for everything. No explanation would change that. Why bother?"

He took another sip.

Suddenly, frantic knocking interrupted them.

Liam raised an eyebrow as Sebastian answered.

Evelyn burst in, tear-streaked and disheveled. She lunged for Liam but Sebastian intercepted her.

"Miss Hartley," Sebastian said politely but firmly, "Mr. Blackwood needs rest. Perhaps this could wait?"

Evelyn shoved past him. "Liam, I've learned my lesson! I'll never bother Olivia again!" She gestured to herself. "Look at me - haven't I suffered enough? I'll behave, I promise! Please forgive me!"

Her tear-filled eyes pleaded. Country life had broken her privileged spirit. The journey back fueled her resentment - both toward Liam's cruelty and his continued use of her reputation.

When acquaintances asked about their "trip together," Evelyn could only smile through the humiliation.

Yet despite everything, one thought of Liam's face melted her anger. She realized her hatred belonged to Olivia, not him.

During her return, she'd nearly died in a suspicious car crash.

That terror had silenced her.

The near-death experience only deepened her obsession.

Liam studied Evelyn over his wine glass. "Do you mean that?"

Evelyn lowered her eyes. "Every word."

Liam clicked his tongue. "Honestly, it wasn't entirely your fault. Olivia overreacted. She could've handled it privately instead of humiliating us both."

Evelyn perked up, pouting. "Exactly! She made me look like the villain while playing victim! If I'd known, I might've pushed her harder!"

Her rant grew increasingly vicious until Liam's sharp look silenced her.

"Sorry," she mumbled, "I shouldn't have said that."

Liam's alcohol-flushed face broke into a chilling smile. He caressed Evelyn's cheek. "No, you're right. It was Olivia's fault. Free tonight? Let's get drinks."

Evelyn's face lit up. "Of course! Where? Here? But with all your employees watching..."

Her cheeks pinked.

Liam's gaze shifted to Sebastian. "Reserve us a table. Take her there in thirty minutes."

As Sebastian left, he shot Evelyn a warning look she chose to ignore.

Boldly, she clung to Liam's arm. "If we drink too much... you could stay at my place. I'll cook for you."

Liam's smile remained, but his eyes turned glacial.
###Chapter 147

Olivia was haunted by restless dreams, her body tossing beneath the thin hospital sheets.

Dark circles shadowed her eyes, prompting the attending physician to recommend melatonin for her frayed nerves.

But terror seized her heart. In her paranoid state, Olivia mistook the harmless pills for something far more sinister - medication to terminate her pregnancy. She shoved the bottle away violently.

Panic rising, she waved everyone out of her private room with frantic gestures.

The medical team exchanged worried glances but complied, not wanting to aggravate their unstable patient further.

Alone at last, Olivia curled into a tight ball at the head of her bed, drawing the blanket over her head like a protective shield.

Her hands cradled the gentle swell of her abdomen. She yearned to whisper reassurances to her unborn child but remembered her voiceless state. Hot tears spilled down her cheeks as she wondered if her baby could sense her love through the silence.

Exhaustion finally pulled her into a fitful doze.

The creak of the door startled her awake.

Liam staggered in reeking of whiskey, his movements unsteady. He caught himself on a chair before collapsing into it several feet from her bed.

Moonlight and hallway illumination painted Olivia's face in stark relief against the darkness.

She looked gaunt, more fragile than he remembered. Even in sleep, tear tracks glistened on her pale cheeks.

Liam opened his mouth, then closed it. The words wouldn't come.

Her refusal had blindsided him.

The doctors reported she wasn't taking prescribed medications.

All Liam knew was that something was wrong.

Initially, rage had kept him away. But concern eventually drove him to inquire after her condition.

The head physician's answers were evasive - sometimes claiming she was fine, other times suggesting she'd withdrawn completely, refusing all communication.

"Just stress," the doctor had assured. "Physically stable but emotionally fragile. Uncooperative with treatment."

This only stoked Liam's anger further. He buried himself in work to avoid thinking about Olivia's continued hospitalization.

The solution seemed simple. If she would just approach him like before, pleading with those expressive eyes, he knew his anger would melt away.

But this new Olivia was different - a caged bird desperate for freedom, straining against the gilded prison he'd built around her.

Did she truly hate him that much?

The thought made Liam's chest constrict. His emotions tangled into an incomprehensible knot - equal parts fury and aching tenderness. He craved destruction, yet longed for peace.

In the suffocating darkness, Liam sighed, rubbing his throbbing temples.

His gaze locked onto Olivia's sleeping form. Before he could stop himself, he surged forward.

Calloused fingers gripped her chin as Liam crushed his lips to hers in an alcohol-tinged kiss. Olivia stirred but didn't wake, unconsciously yielding to his embrace.

What began as punishing and possessive gradually softened into something almost tender.

Releasing her, Liam resolved to give her one final chance to come clean when she awoke.

After a long, searching look, he turned on his heel and left.

As midnight deepened, Olivia plunged into another nightmare.

She dreamed herself bound to a surgical table, utterly helpless.

The door creaked open. A doctor approached wielding glinting instruments.

Then Liam entered, his expression glacial.

Olivia's pleading eyes met his, her voice a strained whisper of his name.

Liam merely smirked. "She's too loud. Slit her throat."

The scalpel flashed downward-

Olivia jolted awake, her pulse hammering against her ribs.

Before she could calm her breathing, a faint tapping startled her.

In the dead quiet, every sound amplified.

Her gaze darted to the window.

Cautiously, she peered out to see figures gathered below her third-story window.

Her breath caught. Alexander Hayes stood among them.

She'd explicitly told him not to come! Yet here he was, waving urgently before pointing to his phone.

Understanding, Olivia grabbed her device. "Mr. Hayes, please don't do this. It's too dangerous for you."

His reply came instantly. "I can see you're suffering. Whatever's holding you there, it ends tonight. Think of me as family. You helped my grandfather - if I abandoned you now, he'd disown me."

Tears welled at his sincerity. The Hayes family's unconditional support overwhelmed her after so long without it.

The escape tempted her. Why stay trapped in this gilded cage?

But her hands drifted to her belly. Could her fragile pregnancy survive the ordeal?

Was it fair to drag Alexander into her dangerous situation?

Misreading her hesitation, Alexander sent damning photos - Liam dining intimately with Evelyn Hartley.

His next messages burned with indignation: "You're imprisoned while he wines and dines his mistress? Open your eyes, Olivia. The Blackwoods don't own you. The Hayes family will protect you."

The words struck like physical blows.

A choice loomed before her - remain Liam's broken songbird, or risk everything for freedom.

Outside, Alexander waited.

Olivia's fingers hovered over her phone screen, trembling.

One message could change everything.

To send, or not to send?

The cursor blinked mockingly.

Her future hung in the balance.
###Chapter 148

Olivia enlarged the photos on her phone screen.

The images showed Liam and Evelyn sharing an intimate dinner by the seaside, illuminated by flickering candlelight.

They hadn’t chosen a private room. Instead, they sat in full view of the restaurant, as if they had nothing to hide.

In one photo, Evelyn was feeding Liam with a playful smile, while in another, he carefully peeled shrimp for her.

They looked like a couple deeply in love—so picture-perfect it could make anyone envious.

Olivia wanted to tell Alexander this wasn’t why she hesitated, but her gaze lingered on Liam’s face in the photos. She traced his features with her eyes, memorizing them, knowing she might never see him again.

She had made her decision. She would leave. Far away from the Blackwood family, where she wouldn’t be a disturbance. Even if tragedy struck her unborn child, she would face it alone.

With resolve hardening in her chest, she texted Alexander. "I’ll go with you."

Alexander’s lips curved into a triumphant smile as he read the message.

Half an hour later, Olivia was safely seated in the car outside Mercy Hospital.

When the engine roared to life, a surreal sensation washed over her. She was finally escaping her nightmare.

Meanwhile, Catherine received word that Liam had gone to the hospital to see Olivia.

Too restless to sleep, Catherine rushed to Mercy Hospital, her mind racing with suspicion.

Though she knew Olivia was pregnant, she had kept it to herself—even coercing the attending physician to pressure Olivia into an abortion. Her motives were personal, tangled with vengeance and self-preservation.

Catherine’s actions were partly for Richard’s sake. Margaret had been furious at Liam’s protectiveness over Olivia, shifting her favor toward Richard.

But after speaking with the doctor, Catherine’s unease deepened. The physician hinted that Olivia’s baby was likely a boy.

The revelation sent a chill down her spine. If Olivia bore the first son of the Blackwood family, where would that leave her?

Margaret would undoubtedly refocus her attention on Liam. And Richard, knowing Catherine could no longer conceive, might discard her without hesitation.

Olivia’s child had to be eliminated.

A cold determination settled in Catherine’s eyes. She stormed into the doctor’s office and rapped sharply on the door.

The physician was about to leave when he saw her icy expression. His stomach dropped. "We must be careful," he warned. "If we rush this, suspicions will rise."

Catherine’s patience snapped. "I can’t wait any longer. Liam visited her today. If he finds out she’s pregnant, we’re finished. I want the abortion done now."

The doctor paled. "You’re risking my career—my life. If Mr. Blackwood discovers this, he’ll destroy me."

Catherine’s voice turned razor-sharp. "I’ve arranged your escape. But if you refuse, you won’t be the only one suffering."

Regret gnawed at the doctor. He never should have taken Olivia as a patient.

Too many wanted her gone—and complicating matters further, she was Liam’s wife.

With a resigned sigh, he relented. "I’ll handle it immediately. But performing an abortion at this hour will raise alarms. Have you considered how you’ll explain this to Liam?"

Catherine smirked. "Why should I explain? Olivia signed the consent form. It’s her choice to terminate the pregnancy, not ours."

Then, her eyes darkened with malice. "And here’s a better idea. Ensure she never wakes up after the procedure. She’s already mute—why not make her silence permanent?"

The doctor recoiled at her ruthlessness. But the more he thought about it, the more the plan appealed to him. His own survival was all that mattered now.

He rushed toward Olivia’s ward with a nurse in tow.

But when they opened the door, the room was empty.

Catherine’s face twisted in fury. "What’s going on? Where is she?"

The doctor’s hands trembled. "She’s gone."

Catherine nearly staggered. She whirled around and slapped him hard. "Find her! Now!"

The doctor scurried off to check the security footage.

Soon, news of Olivia’s disappearance reached Liam, leaving him stunned. "How does someone vanish from a guarded hospital?"

Sebastian wiped sweat from his brow. "It’s as if she disappeared into thin air, sir. I don’t think she could have done this alone. I fear—"

He didn’t finish, but Liam understood.

Liam’s expression turned deadly. "Are you saying someone took her? One of my enemies?"

Sebastian nodded cautiously. "It’s possible. But we don’t know who yet."

Liam’s jaw tightened. "Spread the word. Whoever took Olivia has one hour to return her—or I will burn everything they hold dear to the ground."

He turned sharply. "Come with me to the hospital."

When they arrived, the doctor was waiting, claiming he had urgent information.

But as Liam and Sebastian entered the room, they found Catherine there instead.

Liam’s face darkened. "When did she get here? Why wasn’t I informed?"

Catherine forced a guilty smile. "Margaret wasn’t feeling well, so I came to get her medication. That’s when I heard about Olivia’s disappearance." She feigned concern. "Liam, did something happen between you two? Why would she leave?"

Liam sank into a chair, his aura radiating authority. He didn’t look at her as he spoke. "What happens between Olivia and me is none of your concern. Or have you forgotten why I’m even here?"

Catherine’s smile faltered.

Liam waved a dismissive hand. "Get her out of here. I don’t have time for this."
###Chapter 149

Liam's expression darkened with visible irritation.

Catherine's carefully crafted smile faltered at his dismissive attitude.

As Richard Winslow's wife, Catherine had grown accustomed to deference from everyone - except Liam. The youngest Blackwood heir had never concealed his contempt for her.

She prided herself on her beauty, the very asset that had ensnared Richard's affection years ago. Yet her charms bounced off Liam like arrows against steel.

Like most of high society, Catherine had doubted Olivia Sinclair's marriage to Liam would last. The silent, fragile girl seemed an unlikely match for the tempestuous Blackwood heir.

But the current situation proved otherwise - Liam clearly cared for his wife.

This realization ignited bitter jealousy in Catherine's chest. How could that mute little thing command such devotion?

As she passed Liam in the hallway, Catherine suddenly stopped and declared, "Liam, I came to tell you Olivia has run off with another man. Check the hospital security footage if you don't believe me."

Liam turned slowly, his glacial stare piercing through her.

He advanced with measured steps, each footfall echoing like a death knell in the sterile corridor.

Catherine's confidence wavered under his predatory approach.

His voice emerged deceptively calm yet laced with venom. "Care to guess what I'll do to you for slandering my wife?"

Meeting his murderous gaze, Catherine felt ice water trickle down her spine.

Biting her lower lip, she pressed on. "Why would I lie? I saw it with my own eyes - Olivia got into a man's car when I visited Mercy Hospital. I even noted the license plate. Verify it yourself - you have the resources. I've no reason to deceive you."

Liam's expression remained thunderous as he said nothing.

A bodyguard glanced at Liam for confirmation before releasing Catherine and jotting down the plate number.

Liam's eyes narrowed in recognition - the vehicle belonged to the Whitmore family. His initial fear that Olivia had been kidnapped by business rivals evaporated. She'd left willingly.

The Whitmores, being Olivia's staunch protectors, would never remove her from hospital without her consent. The pieces clicked into place.

Only Alexander would dare spirit Olivia away without informing Liam.

A humorless chuckle escaped Liam as he mocked his earlier concern.

Smug satisfaction warmed Catherine's chest as she prepared to deliver her coup de grâce.

But before she could speak, Liam's head snapped up. "Get out."

"You—" Catherine's face flushed with humiliation, but she lacked the courage to protest further. She turned on her heel.

The attending physician, having witnessed the exchange, hurried over mopping his brow. "Now that you've accomplished your goal, will you release me? I've held up my end - please honor our agreement. I want no part in this. If you're ever caught, leave my name out of it."

Catherine shot him a disdainful look. "Such cowardice. Liam's temper does unsettle people. Your task now is redirecting his anger toward Olivia and Alexander."

The doctor paled at Catherine's malicious grin, unease coiling in his gut. "What exactly are you asking?"

Catherine leaned in, her whisper dripping with venom as she outlined her scheme.

The doctor recoiled, shaking his head violently. "No! Absolutely not! If discovered, I'm ruined! Find someone else!"

As he turned to leave, Catherine seized his wrist with bruising force. "Walk away now, and I'll tell Liam about the hidden camera you placed in Olivia's room. Imagine his reaction to that."

Terror glazed the doctor's eyes as bitter regret flooded him. He should have confessed to Olivia or Liam from the start.

But regrets were useless now. The die was cast.

Seeing his reluctant acquiescence, Catherine's triumph swelled. She patted his shoulder. "Follow my instructions, and your family stays safe. After this, you can leave Mercy Hospital. How about becoming the Winslow family physician? Richard is Liam's elder brother. However foul Liam's temper, he wouldn't dare harm a family retainer. Under Richard's protection, you'll be secure."

Fear gradually gave way to grim determination on the doctor's face. Trapped with no escape, he saw only survival ahead. Catherine's plan was ruthless, but it offered him a way out.

"I'll comply," he muttered.

Catherine's smile widened as she issued final instructions before departing.

Despite their estrangement and separate residences, Richard had unexpectedly agreed to return home today.

Having successfully planted discord between Olivia and Liam, coupled with Richard's surprising homecoming, Catherine floated on euphoria.

She'd planned to prepare dinner at home when impulse struck - why not visit Richard at the office first?

Familiar with the layout, she swiftly navigated to his private office.

Catherine threw open the door with a honeyed, "Darling!"

Her blood turned to ice.

There, on the leather sofa, Richard lay entangled with a younger woman, so absorbed they didn't notice the intrusion.

The scene sent Catherine reeling, vertigo threatening to topple her.

Only when the woman noticed Catherine and shrieked did Richard comprehend the situation.

Blind rage propelled Catherine forward. Though she restrained herself from attacking Richard directly, she couldn't resist slapping the woman hard across the face.

The blow nearly knocked the girl over. She clung to Richard, whimpering, "Mr. Winslow, your wife is vicious! That hurt!"

Richard soothingly caressed the woman's cheek, pointedly ignoring his trembling wife.

Catherine's furious gaze raked over the woman before demanding, "What does she have that I don't? She's not even prettier! Richard, how could you humiliate me with this... this cheap floozy?"

Emboldened, the woman leapt up and jabbed a finger at Catherine. "Don't you get it? It's because I'm younger! You must be pushing forty while I'm barely twenty-two. If I lack your looks, Mr. Winslow clearly prefers youth!"

The barb struck deep, and Catherine felt her sanity unraveling at the edges.
###Chapter 150

Catherine Winslow, consumed by fury and betrayal, attempted to confront the woman again, creating a scene in Richard's office.

Curious employees lingered by the door, but none dared step inside.

Richard had reached his breaking point. Watching Catherine unravel filled him with humiliation. He grabbed her arm and snapped, "Enough! How much longer will you keep this up?"

Catherine's hair was disheveled, her makeup smeared with tears.

Heartbroken, she glared at Richard. "I've stood by you through everything. Haven't I given enough? Why are you doing this to me? Richard, what do you want? Are you trying to force a divorce?"

He pinched the bridge of his nose. "We'll talk at home. You're not thinking clearly right now. I'll have someone drive you back."

Catherine shook her head stubbornly. "No! I want answers now. You have two choices—fire her, or I take our child and move back to my parents' permanently."

She thought her ultimatum would shake him, but Richard only scoffed.

Wrapping an arm around the other woman's waist, he smirked at Catherine. "Leave if you want."

Then, he walked away without another glance.

Catherine stood frozen, stunned, her legs nearly giving out beneath her.

Meanwhile, far from the chaos, Olivia Sinclair found solace as she slipped away from the hospital.

During the drive, Olivia rested a hand on her stomach, lost in thought.

Finally, she typed a message on her phone and showed it to Alexander Hayes beside her: "Can you help me find a private doctor? I don’t want to go back to the hospital—it’s too risky."

Alexander frowned in concern. "Are you alright? Did Liam do something to you?"

Olivia shook her head, then hesitated before typing again: "I'm pregnant. It's Liam's, but I don’t know if the baby is okay. I need to check."

Alexander studied her with sympathy. "Olivia, are you sure about this? Raising a child alone won’t be easy. I know you don’t like relying on others, but you don’t have to do this by yourself."

Olivia typed firmly: "I’ve made up my mind. I can handle it."

She paused, then added softly, "As long as the baby is healthy, I’m keeping it."

Alexander nodded in understanding.

Soon, they arrived at a secluded cottage nestled in the mountains outside the city.

Though modest, it was perfect for one person—quiet and hidden.

Alexander explained that William Hayes had once owned the property, drawn to its peacefulness.

Since it wasn’t valuable, the rest of the Whitmore family had ignored it.

Eventually, William passed it to Alexander.

Even if Liam suspected something, it would take time for him to track her here.

"More importantly," Alexander said, gesturing, "my place is just a short walk away. I avoid the family drama, so I’m usually there. If you need anything, just come by."

Then, he motioned toward the door as someone entered.

Olivia was surprised to see Isabella Rossi.

Isabella smiled warmly.

"I asked Isabella to stay with you," Alexander explained. "She can manage her other work remotely, and I’m paying her double her usual rate."

Olivia was grateful but uneasy.

She typed: "But Isabella has her own life. It’s not fair to drag her into this."

Isabella shook her head. "I chose to come. Besides, the pay is excellent. Don’t worry about me."

Reluctantly, Olivia nodded in thanks.

She had turned to Alexander because she didn’t want to burden Natalie and the others.

Noticing her hesitation, Alexander had arranged for Isabella to keep her company.

Soon, the doctor arrived.

After a brief examination, he reassured her. "The baby is perfectly healthy. You’re nearly three months along—just be cautious during this stage. Regular check-ups will help ensure everything stays on track."

Relief washed over Olivia.

She pressed a hand to her mouth, tears threatening to spill. Her baby was safe. That hospital doctor had lied.

If she hadn’t resisted, or if Alexander hadn’t helped, she might have lost the child in her grief.

A cold realization struck her—Liam had manipulated the doctor to protect his reputation. If she had signed the consent forms, the blame would have fallen on her alone.

Isabella noticed Olivia’s anger and quickly thanked the doctor before he left. Alexander gave a few instructions, then excused himself.

As Isabella approached, Olivia’s sorrow was palpable.

"You don’t have to talk about it," Isabella said gently. "But you’re safe now. Rest—things will get better."

Olivia nodded, but as she stood, tears streamed down her face.

Through gestures, she conveyed her confusion—how, after all these years, Liam could be so cruel. Maybe he had always been this way, and she had never been the exception.

Isabella wiped her tears. "If that’s the case, stop wasting your heart on him. Focus on yourself and your child."

Slowly, Olivia calmed and offered a small, grateful smile.

###Chapter 151

Olivia finally slept through the night, her first proper rest in weeks. As dawn broke, she stirred in the plush bedding, her hand instinctively moving to cradle her belly where tiny flutters reminded her of the life growing inside. For a blissful moment, she thought she might still be dreaming.

She needed to find Isabella. But as her bare feet touched the carpet, muffled voices drifted through the door.

Isabella was speaking urgently into her phone. "Mr. Hayes, I assure you Olivia's perfectly safe. Has Liam made any moves? He's disturbingly persistent - tracking her down so quickly. No, I won't mention anything to her. Surely even Liam wouldn't cross that line!"

The call ended just as Olivia appeared in the doorway, her face drained of color.

Isabella's breath hitched. She shoved the phone into her pocket, forcing a smile that didn't reach her eyes. "You're awake. How are you feeling?"

Olivia shook her head violently, pointing at the concealed phone. Her trembling hands conveyed everything - she'd heard enough.

Her fingers flew in frantic gestures. Did Liam know she'd fled to Alexander? Had her actions endangered them? What had he done?

Seeing Olivia's panic, Isabella rushed forward. "Breathe, just breathe. Yes, Liam knows you're gone. But it's not what you think. He's just exchanging words with Mr. Hayes - no real action yet. We've compiled evidence of everything the Blackwoods did to you, including that forced termination. Even if Liam refuses divorce, we can take it to court. If he dares retaliate, the media will crucify him."

Tears pricked Olivia's eyes at their loyalty, but sorrow twisted her heart. She never wanted this war with Liam. Their marriage had been doomed from the start - she'd been the obstacle keeping him from Evelyn all these years. If he despised her now, she couldn't blame him.

Hesitating, she gestured that before legal battles, she wanted to speak with Liam one last time.

Isabella threw up her hands. "After everything, you still believe he'll change?"

Olivia shook her head, pressing both hands to her abdomen. She wouldn't let her child grow up knowing its parents' hatred. That pain was too cruel.

Isabella's lips trembled as she regarded Olivia with heartbreaking understanding.

Meanwhile, Liam hurled his phone across the study. His chiseled features were marble-cold, fury radiating from every taut muscle.

Sebastian watched silently, knowing this storm was far from over. "Mr. Blackwood, the Hayes family has clearly overreached, but they're likely acting on Olivia's wishes. Perhaps if you spoke with her-"

Liam raked a hand through his hair, stalking to the floor-to-ceiling windows. The cigarette between his fingers trembled slightly as he lit it.

Leaning against his mahogany desk, tendons standing out along his forearms, he ground out, "If she chose to leave, why should I beg for explanations? I gave her everything. She threw it all away."

A bitter laugh escaped him. "Did you see how the Hayes looked at me? Like I was some monster. Olivia's made her feelings perfectly clear."

Sebastian sighed inwardly.

Liam exhaled a cloud of smoke. "No more negotiations with the Hayes family. Where she goes, what she does - it's none of my concern."

A sharp knock interrupted them.

Liam flicked his gaze toward Sebastian, who opened the door to reveal Olivia's physician, his face drawn with urgency.

"Mr. Blackwood isn't receiving visitors," Sebastian began smoothly.

The doctor shook his head. "This can't wait. It's about his wife."

Sebastian signaled to the guards flanking the doorway. Their imposing stances left no room for argument.

The doctor raised his voice. "Mr. Blackwood! Your wife is pregnant!"

Sebastian's polite mask slipped. "You understand the consequences if this is false?"

The doctor swallowed hard. "I attempted to contact Mr. Blackwood days ago. This is no mistake - I'd stake my career on it."

"Sebastian." Liam's voice cut through like a blade. "Let him in."

As the doctor entered, Sebastian's unease grew. This should be joyous news. So why did it feel like standing on the edge of a precipice?

Liam sat motionless, his glacial stare pinning the doctor. "Explain."

"Mrs. Blackwood is approximately five weeks along. Given her medical history - particularly the previous termination - this is a high-risk pregnancy. She requires immediate specialized care, especially during the first trimester when complications are most likely."

The shattering of Liam's crystal tumbler against the wall was his only response.

With a violent sweep of his arm, Liam cleared his desk in one furious motion. Glass and wood splintered against the far wall as his roar of rage echoed through the penthouse.
###Chapter 152

Liam's eyes burned crimson, his gaze predatory. "Say that again. Exactly how far along is she?"

The chief physician trembled visibly, refusing to meet his stare. "Approximately four weeks."

The world seemed to fracture around Liam, the deafening crash of his hopes collapsing into dust. White-hot rage pulsed through his veins, demanding he hunt down Olivia and force the truth from her lips.

Yet suddenly, the fury evaporated.

An overwhelming exhaustion consumed him instead.

The physician dared a sideways glance at Liam, who now resembled a wounded beast stripped of its fight.

Sebastian recognized the dangerous shift in atmosphere. "Thank you for your report, Doctor. You're dismissed. This matter no longer requires your involvement."

The physician nodded, casting one final assessing look at Liam before retreating.

Sebastian exhaled sharply before approaching. "Mr. Blackwood, perhaps we should consider—"

"Out." Liam's voice sliced through the air. "Everyone. I won't tolerate any disturbances unless I permit it."

With a curt nod, Sebastian ushered the staff from the room.

Meanwhile, the physician located Catherine in the hospital corridors.

Catherine had been unraveling since Richard's affair surfaced, her mental state deteriorating rapidly.

Under the pretense of visiting Margaret, she frequented Mercy Hospital with dual purposes: monitoring Olivia and Liam's situation while secretly obtaining psychiatric medication.

Her illness remained her darkest secret—especially from Richard, whose resentment toward her would only deepen if he discovered her weakness.

Spotting the physician, Catherine yanked him into an alcove. "Well?" Her whisper carried the desperation of a woman clinging to sanity. Dark circles shadowed her hollowed eyes.

Normally composed with icy detachment, now a spark of manic hope animated her features—like a demon tasting freedom after centuries in hell.

The physician recoiled slightly before whispering, "As requested, I've informed Liam. While he may not suspect deception, his rage is palpable. He undoubtedly believes the child isn't his."

A grotesque smile twisted Catherine's lips—the first genuine expression she'd worn in months. "Perfect. If I'm denied happiness, neither shall they."

The physician frowned. "This carries significant risk. Liam's been scouring the city for Olivia. If they reunite—"

"What would you know?" Catherine sneered. "Liam now believes she betrayed him. Disgust will replace any affection. Divorce papers are likely being drafted as we speak." Her nails dug into his arm. "Now tell me—do you have access to fertility drugs?"

Shock widened the physician's eyes. "Given your medical history, pregnancy could be fatal—"

"Just procure it!" Catherine hissed. "Your future with the Blackwoods depends on cooperation."

With a resigned sigh, the physician nodded.

Unseen above them, Sebastian observed the exchange through the balcony windows. "Since when has Catherine confided so intimately with that doctor?"

A nearby guard explained, "Mrs. Winslow's been unwell. Likely discussing Lady Margaret's medication. Mr. Blackwood's aware of their consultations."

Sebastian nodded, though unease prickled his instincts.

Meanwhile, after days of confinement, Olivia craved fresh air.

Isabella didn't object.

Though Isabella never mentioned Alexander or Liam, Olivia deduced from her relaxed demeanor that the danger had passed. Liam had apparently abandoned his pursuit, leaving Alexander unharmed.

This was the outcome Olivia had prayed for—yet contentment eluded her.

When Olivia proposed an outing today, Isabella offered an apologetic smile. "Darling, I'd adore accompanying you, but Whitmore Holdings requires my attention. Perhaps tomorrow?"

Olivia gestured that she could assist with company matters.

Isabella hesitated.

Olivia's next signs conveyed her growing guilt over being a burden. She needed purpose beyond four walls.

Finally, Isabella relented. "Very well. Let me fetch the car keys."

They arrived at a coastal warehouse far from Whitmore Holdings' usual territory.

There, Olivia spotted Alexander conversing with familiar associates—and one unexpected face: Julian.

Confusion knitted Olivia's brow. Recent news hadn't clarified their relationship, but tension between them was evident.

Isabella leaned close. "Following the hospital incident, with William still comatose, Julian and Eleanor have been stirring dissent under the guise of seeking justice."

Olivia's lips parted in disbelief at their audacity.

Isabella sighed. "We're powerless. As William's blood relatives, they're untouchable without his intervention. Now Julian shadows Alexander everywhere—supposedly as part of some mentorship."

The salt-tinged wind carried the weight of unspoken complications as Olivia watched the uneasy alliance unfold.
###Chapter 153

Olivia felt a prickle of discomfort at Isabella's words. The gravity of Alexander's situation hadn't fully registered with her until now. Yet here he was, prioritizing her needs despite his own troubles.

Julian Hawthorne, who rarely engaged with Olivia, had maintained nothing but polite professionalism during their limited interactions. He'd even extended assistance during their first encounter.

Still, Olivia couldn't shake the feeling there was more to Julian than met the eye. The situation seemed to have hidden depths waiting to be uncovered.

Both Alexander and Julian spotted Olivia at the same moment.

Alexander moved to approach, but Julian was faster, practically bounding toward her with unexpected enthusiasm.

"What a pleasant surprise seeing you here!" Julian exclaimed, genuine astonishment coloring his tone.

Olivia responded with a courteous smile, quickly typing a message explaining her meeting with Alexander.

"Olivia is my guest," Alexander stated sharply to Julian. "Your focus should be on comprehending the Royal Arch project. They sent you to learn from me, not pry into my personal affairs."

Julian's face fell, his expression wounded. "Alexander, must you always be so harsh? You know I'm not here by choice. The family—"

"Enough," Alexander cut him off with an impatient gesture. "Leave us."

With obvious reluctance, Julian turned on his heel and departed.

Olivia watched his retreating figure, concern knitting her brows. She typed a warning for Alexander not to provoke Julian on her account. With Liam Blackwood already monitoring Alexander's every move, making an enemy of Julian would only complicate matters further.

Alexander's expression remained stony. "This isn't about you. I simply can't tolerate the man. If he weren't Eleanor's son, I'd have removed him long ago." He abruptly changed subjects. "What brings you here today?"

His sharp glance at Isabella carried clear irritation.

Quick to defend her assistant, Olivia signaled that she'd insisted on the outing, believing fresh air would benefit the baby's development.

Alexander's demeanor softened marginally. "Just be careful then."

Unseen by them, Julian observed their exchange from a distance. The obvious care Alexander showed Olivia planted an idea in his mind.

After persistent encouragement from Olivia, Alexander finally revealed the Hayes family's predicament.

A longstanding client had unexpectedly betrayed Whitmore Holdings.

"Terminating our partnership would be one thing," Alexander said with a shrug. "Business relationships should be mutually beneficial."

But the client seemed determined to ensure there would be no peaceful coexistence moving forward.

Worse, they'd resorted to dirty tactics, actively tarnishing Whitmore Holdings' reputation within the industry.

The client claimed their past cooperation had hinged on William Hayes' involvement. With William gone, they alleged product quality had deteriorated under Alexander's leadership, with frequent defects and subpar merchandise.

They maintained these issues had always existed but were previously overlooked to preserve the relationship. Recent events, however, had convinced them Whitmore Holdings wasn't worth further collaboration.

Olivia's heart ached for Alexander.

Even during William's prime, Alexander had shouldered most of Whitmore Holdings' operations.

The client's accusations amounted to character assassination, though their motives remained unclear.

Rubbing his temples, Alexander noticed Olivia's concerned expression. "This is my battle," he reassured her. "Don't trouble yourself. You should rest."

But Olivia shook her head, typing rapidly. "Tell me about this client. If they were truly unreasonable, you wouldn't have maintained the partnership this long."

A bitter smile touched Alexander's lips as he regarded Olivia with newfound admiration. Her perception surprised him.

"That's what puzzles me," he admitted. "Despite their temperament, they've always been reliable. We must have provoked them somehow, but despite my attempts at communication, we can't seem to bridge this divide."

Alexander was at his wit's end. The client held considerable industry influence. Failure to resolve this could spark widespread doubts about Whitmore Holdings' credibility.

Even an established entity like theirs wasn't immune to reputation damage.

Alexander knew all too well how quickly minor issues could snowball into catastrophes. Without resolution, further complications were inevitable.

After a thoughtful pause, Olivia began typing suggestions, hinting she might have a solution.

Just then, Julian came rushing back, eyes alight. "Alexander! Their manager agreed to a meeting to discuss the issues!"

Normally indifferent to Julian, Alexander couldn't suppress an approving grin. "You actually got them to the table? Perhaps you're not entirely useless."

Julian beamed, eager to please. "I can be persuasive when needed. I'm here to support you."

Alexander remained unimpressed by Julian's flattery. He had little patience for those who masked their true intentions behind pleasantries.

Keeping his gaze steady, Alexander said, "As your cousin, I'll be blunt. Stay out of trouble—you and your mother—and I'll ensure you're taken care of."

Julian feigned confusion, seemingly missing Alexander's veiled warning. "Of course! Consider me at your service."

Alexander ignored this and moved ahead with Olivia.

Julian trailed behind, maneuvering to walk beside Olivia when Alexander was distracted.

"Olivia," Julian began with apparent concern. "I know you're close to my cousin. May I ask—you've probably noticed Alexander's hostility toward me? I've been trying everything to prove my loyalty."

Olivia might have dismissed him, but she remembered Julian's intervention when she and Alexander were ambushed by paparazzi. She owed him for that.

Pausing thoughtfully, Olivia began composing her reply.
###Chapter 154

Olivia turned her phone screen toward Julian. "Your cousin doesn't appreciate dishonesty. If your intentions are genuine, there's no need for proof. He'll recognize it eventually. Deeds reveal more than declarations ever could."

Julian's eyes flickered with sudden understanding. "I see. Thank you for the insight."

Casually changing the subject, Julian continued, "Speaking of which, why are you staying with my cousin these days? Not that I'm implying anything. It's just... certain rumors have reached my ears, and I'm concerned for your safety. Perhaps it would be wiser to remain indoors for a while. If the Blackwoods find you, it might create complications for Alexander."

Olivia studied Julian's expression carefully. His concern for Alexander appeared sincere. Her fingers flew across the screen as she typed, "No need to worry. My stay with the Whitmores is temporary. I'll be departing soon."

"Is that so?" Julian's smile widened as his suspicions were confirmed. Olivia had indeed fled from Liam.

In truth, Julian knew very little about the actual situation. He'd only heard about the recent falling out between Alexander and Liam. The specifics remained unclear. But given Olivia's connection to Liam, Julian had made an educated guess.

Slowing his pace, Julian watched Alexander conversing with the client. A cold chuckle escaped his lips. He'd long abandoned any expectations of Alexander. Perhaps it was time to find a new ally. Julian had been considering potential candidates when inspiration struck.

Alexander rubbed his temples, feeling the onset of a migraine. He couldn't believe the audacity of this mid-level manager, speaking to him with such disrespect. Yet he had no choice. He needed to understand the client's grievances. If resolving them required concessions, he was prepared to comply.

The manager lifted his chin arrogantly. "Mr. Whitmore, how about we share a meal first? Then perhaps I'll consider discussing business matters. Though I may require a small favor in return. I hope that won't be too much to ask."

Alexander's eye twitched, his expression turning glacial. "As long as your requests remain reasonable, I'll see to them immediately. Just remember your end of the bargain."

With those words, Alexander turned sharply and strode away, his face an unreadable mask.

As Alexander departed, Julian approached the nervous manager.

Dropping his earlier bravado, the manager whispered urgently, "Did it work? Can we really pull this off?"

"Without question," Julian replied confidently. "I've sent all the photographic evidence. He's definitely coming. Just maintain your composure, and your future is secured. Don't forget our agreement when the time comes."

When the scheduled meeting time arrived, Alexander had intended to send Isabella and Olivia home first. But chaos erupted.

The primary issue was the manager's incessant demands, becoming increasingly unreasonable.

When Alexander finally caught a breath, he realized how much time had passed. He couldn't simply send Olivia home after making her wait so long.

As Alexander and Olivia entered the private dining room, concern shadowed Alexander's features.

Speaking solemnly, Alexander advised, "If the manager pressures you to drink, ignore him. This matter is between him and me. Don't compromise your wellbeing for my problems. If you feel uncomfortable and want to leave, tell me immediately. Isabella will accompany you. Please don't wander off alone - I wouldn't be able to find you quickly if something happened. And remember to be extra careful given your condition."

Alexander recalled the family physician's warnings. Olivia's health was delicate, her pregnancy requiring constant vigilance. The risk of miscarriage was high, with potential life-threatening complications.

Olivia offered a grateful smile, touched by his brotherly concern. Such protective care was comforting rather than burdensome.

Unbeknownst to them, Liam observed this intimate exchange from a short distance.

Though he couldn't hear every word, fragments like "pregnancy" and "take care" reached his ears.

These snippets, combined with the anonymous photo he'd received - showing Olivia and Alexander sharing a meal, both radiating happiness, particularly Olivia - intensified Liam's discomfort.

Liam struggled to remember the last time he'd seen Olivia so relaxed and joyful.

It seemed only in Alexander's presence could she truly unwind. Did she trust Alexander that completely? And was the child she carried Alexander's? When had this relationship begun?

The more Liam dwelled on these thoughts, the more unsettled he became, his rage building once more.

Noticing the dangerous glint in Liam's eyes, Sebastian leaned in to whisper, "Mr. Blackwood, since you're meeting Olivia today anyway, why not ask her directly?"

Liam merely grunted, restraining himself from storming in immediately.

Alexander had already taken charge of the situation. He settled into his seat, graciously accepting several drinks, hoping the manager might reveal something.

But the previously confident manager now hesitated. "I can't disclose much about this matter. It involves company secrets, and it wouldn't be proper for me to share details. Besides, no amount of discussion will change the situation. The mistake has been made. You might consider alternative strategies to regain my superior's favor."

Realizing he'd been deceived, Alexander shot up, grabbing the manager's collar, fist raised.

Trembling with fear, the manager stammered, "Mr. Whitmore, I swear I haven't lied to you! I don't know the reasons, but someone else does. As I mentioned earlier, if you're willing to offer something, he'll certainly share the information."

Alexander's laughter held an edge of frustration. "Do you enjoy playing games with me? A minor business setback is one thing, but dealing with someone like you is child's play. Did you even consider the consequences before coming here? No matter - I'll show you exactly what they are."

The manager paled, making desperate gestures toward Julian.

Julian dared not speak, attempting to blend into the background. Things weren't going as planned. He'd sent Liam substantial "evidence" of Alexander and Olivia together. What man could tolerate such betrayal?

Moreover, Olivia remained by Alexander's side in the private dining room, while Liam - despite knowing their whereabouts - avoided confrontation.

Just as Julian's anxiety peaked, an icy voice cut through from the doorway. "Mr. Whitmore, let's not escalate this. Not everything he's told you is false."
###Chapter 155

Olivia froze at the sound of that voice. Her spine straightened instantly, heart pounding so hard she wondered if she might be hallucinating.

Liam Blackwood strode into the room with predatory grace. His sharp gaze swept across the assembled faces before lingering on Olivia with deliberate intensity.

She kept her eyes fixed straight ahead, fingers digging into the tablecloth. A storm of emotions churned inside her—shock, fear, and something dangerously close to longing.

Alexander Hayes was the first to react. He shot Isabella Rossi a meaningful look, and the woman rose smoothly from her seat.

"Olivia, you seem unwell. Let's return home," Isabella suggested, placing a gentle hand on her shoulder.

"What's the rush?" Liam's voice cut through the room like a blade. That infuriating smirk played on his lips. "Doesn't Mr. Hayes want to know why his client is so distressed?"

Understanding dawned on Alexander's face. He slammed his palms against the table, rising abruptly. "What are you implying? The Blackwoods and Hayeses have been allies for generations. Are you truly willing to destroy that?"

Liam dismissed the accusation with a careless wave as he advanced toward them.

Julian Hawthorne scrambled aside, his obsequious smile making it painfully clear who had orchestrated this meeting. The traitor had been working under their noses all along.

Alexander had suspected Julian's duplicity but never imagined the depth of his betrayal. When had he started conspiring with Liam?

Taking a seat opposite them, Liam's voice turned glacial. "Mr. Hayes, your theatrics amuse me. Who exactly is threatening our families' alliance? This is a personal matter, yet you insist on meddling. Makes one question your motives."

Though unspoken, everyone knew why Liam was here.

Olivia's face drained of color. Her hands fluttered protectively over her abdomen, panic rising like bile in her throat. She needed to stay composed—for the baby's sake.

She considered standing, ready to confess that she'd sought Alexander's help to escape the hospital. If Liam wanted to vent his fury, it should be directed at her alone.

Just as she moved to rise, Isabella's grip tightened on her wrist.

"Trust Mr. Hayes," Isabella murmured. "We mustn't provoke him further."

Olivia shook her head frantically, gesturing that she couldn't let Alexander bear the consequences of her actions.

Liam watched this exchange, his jaw tightening. He regretted learning sign language now—every desperate motion of Olivia's hands was a knife twisting in his chest. She was defending another man.

Had she always cared this much about Alexander? Liam had been so secure in her devotion that he'd never noticed potential rivals. This revelation struck like a physical blow.

A cold chuckle escaped him as he addressed the room. "Regarding whether Whitmore Holdings survives this crisis... I might possess crucial information." His smirk turned predatory. "For the right price."

Alexander's nostrils flared. "Name it."

"Oh, I doubt you're prepared for my terms." Liam's gaze locked onto Olivia. "She spends the night with me."

Dead silence.

The clueless manager, oblivious to Olivia's true identity as Liam's wife, saw only an opportunity to curry favor. He leaned toward Alexander with a conspiratorial wink.

"Mr. Hayes, she's lovely, but surely not worth risking your company? Women like her are replaceable. Be reasonable."

Alexander's fists clenched, but Sebastian Montgomery struck first.

One glance at Liam's thunderous expression told Sebastian this fool had signed his own death warrant.

He grabbed the manager by his collar and delivered a crushing blow.

The man staggered back, clutching his bleeding nose in shock. "Mr. Montgomery! What did I—"

"Remove him," Liam commanded icily. "This imbecile has wasted enough of my time. Hiring such morons would bankrupt Blackwood Enterprises through sheer stupidity."

Terror dawned on the manager's face as Sebastian dragged him away. His career was over.

In the parking garage, the man whimpered, "Please, tell me how I offended Mr. Blackwood! I betrayed my employer for him today!"

Sebastian looked down in disgust. "Had you kept your mouth shut, you might have survived. But insulting her?" He shook his head. "You've angered someone far more dangerous than Liam Blackwood."

The manager would never understand that the person Sebastian referred to was the very woman he'd dismissed as disposable.

Julian trembled nearby, realizing a careless word could trigger catastrophic consequences. The manager had groveled relentlessly, yet Liam showed no mercy.

Julian wasn't foolish enough to challenge Liam's wrath. Flattery wouldn't work—Liam had sycophants lining up daily. He needed a different approach.

Olivia felt the tension thickening the air. She risked a glance at Alexander, her eyes brimming with apology.

Liam noticed. His fingers drummed impatiently against the table.

Alexander opened his mouth to speak—

###Chapter 156

Liam's words died in his throat.

Olivia shot up from her chair with such suddenness that every head turned in her direction.

He'd expected this reaction. The corners of Liam's mouth curled upward, but his gaze turned glacial.

Alexander, visibly distressed, reached for Olivia's arm. "This doesn't involve you," he urged. "Sit down."

Olivia brushed past him without acknowledgment, striding toward Liam with purposeful steps.

Liam watched her approach, each footfall resonating with unshakable resolve.

The transformation was startling. Those same eyes that once held such warmth now glittered with Arctic frost.

Memories flooded Liam's mind - of a softer Olivia who absorbed his cruelty with quiet endurance. How she'd always responded to his harshness with that infuriatingly gentle smile. Never before had she leveled such an icy stare at him.

He'd often wished she'd grow a spine. Now that she had, her newfound strength was directed entirely against him.

So lost in thought, Liam barely registered when Olivia stopped mere inches away.

Drawing a steadying breath, Olivia's hands began moving with precise gestures. She'd go with him tonight, but he must honor his promise to explain the client situation to Alexander. Her cooperation came with strict terms - one night only.

The faint tremor in her fingers didn't escape Liam's notice, his brow furrowing.

Was she afraid of him? Or was this about something deeper?

Right now, Alexander seemed to dominate Olivia's thoughts, leaving Liam grasping for clarity.

Did she truly view him as some uncontrollable beast?

A humorless smile twisted Liam's lips as he spoke, each word dripping with venom. "You're in no position to negotiate terms, Olivia. Do you understand your situation at all?"

Olivia flinched as if struck.

Before she could respond, Liam was already moving, his hand closing like a manacle around her wrist. He propelled her toward the exit.

"Olivia!" The twin cries of Isabella and Alexander rang out, laced with alarm as they scrambled after them.

They reached the doorway only to find Sebastian Montgomery blocking their path, flanked by security.

Sebastian maintained a polite smile. "They're still married. Mr. Blackwood means her no harm."

Alexander's hands clenched into white-knuckled fists. "He'd better remember that."

Liam practically shoved Olivia into the passenger seat. "Buckle up," he commanded before firing the engine.

With shaking fingers, Olivia secured her seatbelt, casting anxious glances at Liam.

The car launched forward like a bullet, tearing through city streets with terrifying speed.

As skyscrapers gave way to open countryside, the traffic thinned until they raced alone through the darkness.

Liam's foot pressed the accelerator to the floor, transforming the vehicle into a projectile hurtling down deserted roads.

Tears streamed down Olivia's face as the car became a metal missile. Was he trying to kill them both? To endanger their unborn child?

Miraculously, Liam's driving remained controlled despite the reckless speed.

When the car finally screeched to a halt, Olivia tumbled out, her legs buckling beneath her. She caught herself on the door frame, gasping for air.

Before she could steady herself, Liam was there, his fingers digging into her jaw with bruising force.

Tears welled in Olivia's eyes from the pain, but Liam seemed not to notice.

Something raw and wounded flashed in Liam's eyes. "Why?" His voice cracked. "Do you really think I'm that monstrous?"

Olivia stared in confusion. He'd just endangered their child, yet he stood there looking like the wounded party?

Her hands flew in desperate signs - if he let her go now, she'd vanish from his life forever.

Liam recoiled as if struck, his grip slackening. For a moment, he seemed lost.

Turning away, Liam's voice turned arctic. "Fine. But on one condition." His next words landed like a physical blow. "Terminate the pregnancy, and you're free to go."

The pain lanced through Olivia so sharply she nearly doubled over.

She'd expected this demand, but hearing it aloud shattered her.

Olivia reached for him instinctively - to demand what she'd done to deserve this, to ask why their child didn't deserve life.

But her hand froze midair. She couldn't bear whatever cruel response might follow.

Wiping her tears, Olivia squared her shoulders. Her signs were firm - she would keep this child. She wasn't his property to command.

Her protective hand cradled her stomach, reinforcing her stance.

Liam's answering smile held no warmth. "Do you know what happened to the last person who defied me like this?"

Though his tone promised violence, Olivia didn't flinch.

Seeing her resolve, Liam's expression shifted. "Fine," he conceded. "But here are my terms. You'll stay with me until delivery. I need household management. Don't worry - I won't harm the child intentionally. But refuse, and I can't guarantee the safety of anyone who helps you. And don't think of running. We both know I'll find you. After birth, you're free to go."

Olivia's eyes widened in disbelief. Her hands moved angrily - how could he expect a pregnant woman to serve as domestic staff? Had he no conscience?

Liam's laugh was bitter. "Conscience? You're lecturing me on morality? Compared to you, I'm practically a saint."

Olivia staggered under the accusation, wounded and confused. What imagined crimes was he punishing her for?

The injustice left her speechless, defenseless against his twisted narrative.
###Chapter 157

Olivia inhaled sharply, her chest tightening with the realization that compliance was her only viable choice against Liam's demands.

Tears pricked at her eyelids as she gave a reluctant nod, her sole stipulation being Alexander's immediate release.

Liam's smirk transformed into a predatory grin as he yanked the car door open. "Good girl. Get in - we're taking a little trip," he commanded with icy precision.

The moment Olivia slid into the leather seat, her phone vibrated with Alexander's concerned message.

His text inquired about her safety, questioned Liam's actions, and suggested police intervention if necessary.

Her fingers hovered over the screen when Liam's glacial warning cut through the silence. "Reply to him and I'll reconsider my generosity instantly."

Jaw clenched, Olivia shoved the device into her purse, earning a self-satisfied chuckle from Liam.

The luxury sedan glided to a stop outside Midnight, an establishment radiating exclusivity with its gilded entrance.

Staff members bowed deeply as Liam passed, their obsequious greetings confirming his elite status.

Olivia's stomach churned as she wondered how often Liam frequented this place - perhaps with Evelyn on his arm.

The nauseating thought coincided with a sudden wave of morning sickness, her pregnancy asserting itself at the worst possible moment.

She froze, pressing a hand to her mouth as bile rose in her throat.

Liam's hawk-like gaze missed nothing.

His expression darkened as he studied her. The doctor had confirmed she was merely four weeks along - too early for such symptoms unless... unless her revulsion stemmed from his mere presence.

"Changed your mind already?" Liam's voice dripped venom as he crossed his arms, the fabric straining over his biceps. "Or just remembering happier times with Alexander?"

Olivia gestured weakly toward the overpowering scent of whiskey and cigars permeating the air.

Liam's scoff held no sympathy. "Funny how alcohol never bothered you during your cozy dinners with Alexander."

White-hot anger surged through Olivia. The insinuation in Liam's tone was unmistakable.

The realization struck like lightning - he genuinely believed she'd betrayed him with Alexander. The hypocrisy burned when he'd been publicly parading Evelyn for months. Was this his twisted way of justifying his own infidelity?

Fury propelled her forward. Ignoring Liam's outstretched hand, she stormed past him into the dim interior, her stiletto heels striking the marble like gunshots.

Liam's eyes tracked her furious stride, his own temper simmering beneath the surface.

Inside the private lounge, he attacked the whiskey bottle with single-minded intensity, draining glass after glass.

Despite her anger, Olivia's fingers twitched with concern. Before she could stop herself, she snatched the crystal decanter from his grasp.

Liam's eyebrow arched in sardonic amusement. "Playing nurse now? Or just worried I'll make a scene?"

Olivia shook her head sharply, miming that his potential alcohol poisoning would inevitably become her problem.

The temperature in the room seemed to drop ten degrees as Liam's eyes turned arctic.

Olivia stumbled backward, caught off guard by the sudden shift in atmosphere.

Strong hands steadied her before yanking her down onto the velvet couch with controlled violence. The momentary vulnerability in his gaze vanished as quickly as it appeared.

"Stop hovering. Pour," he ordered, nudging the bottle toward her.

When she hesitated, Liam captured her wrist in an unbreakable grip, his smile not reaching his eyes. "I didn't ask for your concern. Just your obedience."

Reluctantly, Olivia complied, watching the amber liquid rise in his glass with growing unease.

Alcohol painted Liam's usually pale complexion with a dangerous flush, yet his hold on her never slackened - if anything, it intensified.

Olivia bit back a whimper as his fingers dug into her tender flesh. Resisting would only provoke him further, though she cursed herself for caring about his wellbeing at all.

Abruptly, Liam set down his drink. Even inebriated, his gaze remained unsettlingly clear - the perpetual vigilance of a man who trusted no one.

Olivia remembered countless nights spent trying to ease his tension during their marriage, only to watch him withdraw further into darkness.

His sudden accusation sliced through her memories. "Tell me, Olivia - all that effort to please me. Was it guilt? Or just excellent acting?"

She shook her head frantically, desperate to explain she'd only wanted to reclaim their lost happiness.

But Liam was already turning away, her unspoken words dissolving into the charged air between them.

The past crashed over Olivia with startling clarity when Liam's forehead dropped heavily onto her shoulder.

Every muscle in her body locked. This proximity - once so familiar - now felt foreign yet achingly recognizable.

Liam's whiskey-laced whisper burned against her ear. "Just one reason. Is it me you hate? Or the Blackwood name? What terrifies you enough to keep running?"

Olivia's face contorted with unspoken answers. When she tried to gesture, Liam's grip on her wrist tightened painfully.

His bitter laugh sent chills down her spine. "My touch repulses you now? When exactly did that start?"

A shadow of genuine pain flickered across his features, gone before Olivia could process it.

Assuming his erratic behavior stemmed from intoxication, frustration bubbled within her. She'd warned him about overindulging, but when had Liam ever listened?

With a sharp twist, she freed her wrist, revealing angry red marks against her fair skin. Her eyes shimmered with unshed tears, amplifying her wounded expression.

Liam glanced away abruptly. "Help me up," he muttered gruffly.

Olivia hauled him upright with unnecessary force, struggling under his dead weight. Liam seemed to lean into her deliberately, making each step a battle.

By the time they reached the exit, her breath came in ragged gasps.

As if orchestrated by some cruel deity, rain began sheeting down outside. Liam turned with feigned innocence. "You wouldn't want your drunk husband catching pneumonia, would you?"

Olivia nearly growled in frustration. Knowing his vindictive nature, she reluctantly shrugged off her blazer and draped it over his head like a makeshift hood.

Sebastian arrived with the car at that precise moment. The assistant's eyes widened comically at the sight of his boss being tended to like a child. "Mr. Blackwood, I..." he stammered, clearly at a loss.
###Chapter 158

Olivia Sinclair hesitated before reaching out to steady Liam Blackwood. His icy glare stopped her mid-motion.

Sebastian Montgomery caught the silent exchange and opened the car doors without comment.

Dripping wet and exhausted, Olivia struggled to help Liam into the vehicle. Every movement felt like lifting weights.

Just as she moved to enter herself, Liam slammed the door shut right in her face.

Olivia knocked sharply on the tinted window, her eyebrows raised in silent question.

Liam ignored her completely. "Get her another car," he ordered Sebastian.

The assistant gave Olivia an apologetic glance before starting the engine.

Within minutes, a second luxury sedan pulled up.

The new driver handed Olivia a plush towel and adjusted the heating. "There's medication in the compartment if you need it," he offered.

Olivia shook her head. Another of Liam's calculated moves - cruelty tempered with consideration. She couldn't decipher his endgame. Leaning back, she let exhaustion pull her into restless sleep.

Meanwhile, Liam's sober-up pills began working. His flushed complexion faded slightly.

Sebastian finally broke the tense silence. "Mr. Blackwood, I understand your anger about Olivia's pregnancy, but this confrontation solves nothing. You need to either talk it out or walk away permanently."

Liam's gaze could have frozen hell. "Since when do you counsel me on personal matters?"

Sebastian wisely fell silent.

A heavy sigh escaped Liam. "I can't let this go. Yet the truth might destroy me more than my suspicions."

His voice turned arctic. "And who leaked Olivia's pregnancy? I explicitly ordered confidentiality."

"We're investigating," Sebastian assured. "We'll have answers soon."

Liam's eyes narrowed dangerously. "That primary physician - Adrian Mueller?"

Sebastian considered. "Possible, but he's hospital royalty. Why risk his career?"

"Find the traitor," Liam commanded, rubbing his temples.

After a pause, Sebastian ventured carefully, "Sir, when the pregnancy news inevitably breaks, and given the child's parentage..."

Opponents would target Olivia regardless of distractions. If paternity rumors spread, both their reputations would shatter.

Margaret Winslow would seize the opportunity. Her hatred for Olivia was legendary.

Liam could easily walk away unscathed. Yet he stayed trapped.

"Why do you think I keep her close?" Liam's glacial stare held unspoken warnings.

Sebastian finally understood. Liam was truly cornered. He wondered what thoughts haunted Olivia.

Having witnessed their history, Sebastian believed Olivia still carried a torch for Liam. Now it was a standoff - who'd break first?

Arriving at the mansion, Olivia's stomach twisted. She craved only a hot shower and bed.

Liam had other plans.

She found him sprawled on the sofa, his sculpted jawline and Adam's apple exposed as he reclined.

Olivia quickened her pace, pretending not to see him.

"Running away?" Liam's voice stopped her. "Forgetting our agreement?"

She gestured that she remembered but needed rest.

Liam stood, slightly unsteady from alcohol.

Olivia made no move to assist.

His jaw clenched. "What if I fell and cracked my skull? Would that please you?"

Reluctantly, she approached, taking his arm while signaling she'd help him up but nothing more - the baby came first.

Liam chuckled darkly. "Prioritizing that... thing over me?"

Olivia released him instantly, furious. She signed sharply - this was her child, not some "thing."

Her sudden release sent Liam tumbling onto the couch. His head hit the backrest with a thud.

Panic spiked through Olivia. Had she hurt him? She dropped to her knees, shaking him urgently.

When he didn't respond, her trembling hands reached for her phone to call Sebastian.

A low laugh stopped her. Mocking. Cruel.

White-hot rage flooded Olivia. She shot him a venomous look, stormed to the guest room, and locked the door with finality.

Her phone buzzed - Alexander Hayes. "Status? Is Liam harassing you? Your location?"

Isabella Rossi had also messaged, both clearly worried.

Olivia forced a smile for a selfie. "Fine now. Boundaries set with Liam. Daily check-ins promised."

Alexander's relieved reply came instantly.

Yet as he typed, his expression hardened. "Where's Julian Hawthorne? Still not apprehended?"
###Chapter 159

The phone trembled in Alexander's grip as the anxious voice crackled through the receiver. "Mr. Hayes, we've hit a dead end. The boy's too clever—he sensed something was off and vanished. If we go after his mother now, it might blow up in our faces."

Alexander's knuckles whitened, his gaze turning glacial. "At this point, the world already sees me as the villain. What's left of my reputation to lose? Make the arrangements. I need to speak with him—face to face."

Just as he ended the call, another notification buzzed in—this time from Mercy Hospital. "Mr. Hayes, urgent update—William has regained consciousness."

All other concerns evaporated. Alexander slammed his foot on the accelerator, the car roaring toward the hospital.

Before he even reached the ward, the sound of dramatic sobbing reached his ears.

Eleanor's voice, thick with emotion, carried through the door. "Father, I was so afraid while you were unconscious. I swear I'll never disobey you again. I've brought Julian back with me—he'll take care of you now."

Alexander pushed the door open, his expression unreadable. There she was—Eleanor, clutching William's frail hand, tears streaming down her face. But to Alexander, her grief reeked of performance.

William looked fragile, a shadow of the formidable man he once was. His trembling hand reached for Eleanor, his eyes softening. "Eleanor..."

Tears welled in William's eyes. Despite everything, she was still his daughter. Age had a way of making family wounds ache less and love matter more.

Eleanor, seizing the moment, leaned in and whispered, "Daddy..."

For a second, Alexander wondered if he had imagined the woman who had once cursed William's name over a man.

Then Eleanor noticed him lingering in the doorway and flashed a saccharine smile. "Alexander, don't just stand there. Come in—your grandfather's been waiting for you."

Alexander strode forward, his expression dark. Eleanor resumed her theatrics. "Father, don't be upset. Alexander hasn't been able to visit much—he's been so busy. But look, he's here now. Such a devoted grandson."

Alexander's voice cut like ice. "Eleanor, you make it sound like you've been the one coordinating his treatments and consulting specialists day and night. All you've done is show up to cry and make a scene. What exactly have you contributed?"

Eleanor's sobs hitched mid-breath.

Her face flushed with humiliation.

"Alexander!" William snapped, his disapproval sharp. The outburst sent him into a coughing fit, his weakened body struggling.

Eleanor reached to steady him, but William recoiled.

Once he caught his breath, William's expression hardened. "I need to speak with Alexander alone. Leave us."

Eleanor hesitated, shooting a venomous glance at Alexander before slinking out of the room.

The moment the door clicked shut, Alexander's composure fractured. His hands shook as he gripped William's. "Grandfather, how are you? If the treatments here aren't enough, we'll go abroad. We'll find a solution."

William shook his head, his stern features softening into a rare, tender smile. "I failed you when the family was in chaos. But you've proven yourself more than capable. The future of Whitmore Holdings is in good hands." He paused, his voice thick. "These past weeks... they couldn't have been easy for you."

Alexander turned his head sharply, blinking back the sting in his eyes.

William continued, his tone grave. "There's something I must ask of you. Your aunt has made mistakes, but she's still my daughter. If anything happens to me... I don't want her or Julian inheriting anything from the company. I've set aside private funds for them. They'll be taken care of."

Alexander stiffened. "Grandfather, have you forgotten what she said when she left with that man? If she cared even a little, she wouldn't have betrayed you like that. Are you really falling for her act?"

William sighed, his voice resolute. "I'm not blind. My vision may be fading, but my judgment isn't. But what choice do I have? She's still my blood. I spoiled her too much when she was young—never taught her right from wrong. That failure is mine."

Tears rolled down William's weathered cheeks.

Alexander's chest tightened. After a long silence, he swallowed his anger. He wouldn't burden William with Julian's schemes—not now. Not when the truth about Olivia would shatter him.

His jaw set, Alexander nodded. "As long as Julian and Eleanor stay out of trouble from now on, I'll treat them fairly."

William exhaled in relief, his grip loosening slightly.

Meanwhile, outside the ward, Eleanor paced like a caged animal, her nerves frayed.

She tried to slip back inside, but one of Alexander's bodyguards blocked her path.

Indignant, she hissed, "How dare you? I'm William Hayes' daughter! Since when do I need permission to see my own father?"

The guard remained impassive. "Apologies, ma'am. Orders from Mr. Hayes and Mr. William. No exceptions."

Another guard smirked. "We answer to the head of the Whitmore family. Are you the head?"

Eleanor's face twisted. With a furious huff, she stormed off toward another ward.

The moment she was alone, she dialed Julian, her voice trembling. "I did as you said. The old man was emotional—he even cried when he saw me. But then Alexander showed up, and they threw me out. What are they plotting in there? Do you think they're cutting us out?"

The thought sent a chill down her spine. She had just reclaimed her place in the Whitmore luxury—she couldn't lose it now.

Julian's voice was grim. "They won't exile us outright, but I suspect he's instructing Alexander to exclude us from the family's future. Direct confrontation won't work. We need to be smarter."

"No!" Eleanor's fist clenched, her nails biting into her palm. "I am William Hayes' daughter, and you are his grandson. Why shouldn't we inherit everything? You deserve Whitmore Holdings more than Alexander ever will!"

"Mother," Julian cut in, his tone sharp with impatience. "Yelling won't help. The other branches of the family are irrelevant now. I've already secured an alliance with someone far more powerful."

His next words sent a slow, calculating smile spreading across Eleanor's face.

The game wasn't over yet.
###Chapter 160

Olivia's curiosity instantly flared. "Really? That's wonderful! Who is it?"

Julian, however, remained evasive. "It doesn't matter who. Listen, I have urgent matters to attend to. I must go."

With that, Julian abruptly ended the call. Tossing his umbrella aside with a sharp flick of his wrist, he chose instead to kneel in the pouring rain outside Liam's grand villa.

A security guard spotted Julian and hurried over. "Sir, may I assist you? If you're here to see Mr. Blackwood, appointments are required. If you insist on kneeling here, I'll have no choice but to call the authorities."

Julian looked utterly drained, his voice trembling. "I'm desperate. I need to speak with Mr. Blackwood immediately." His plea was raw with urgency. "Please, just tell him Julian Hawthorne is here. I only need one answer, and then I'll leave."

Reluctantly, the guard radioed a servant inside. After a tense pause, Liam's voice crackled through the walkie-talkie, cold and dismissive. "If he enjoys kneeling, let him stay."

Julian's face paled. He wanted to protest—didn't Liam care about the spectacle of a man kneeling in the rain outside his home? But he swallowed his pride, biting his lip hard enough to draw blood.

He told himself that not being outright rejected meant there was still hope. He had to endure this humiliation. Cooperating with Liam was his only lifeline now. Otherwise, given his actions, Alexander would crush him like an insect.

Meanwhile, Olivia, exhausted from the day's turmoil, longed for sleep. Just as she began to drift off, a soft knock startled her awake. "Madam, may I come in? I've prepared nourishing soup for you—perfect for the baby."

The word "baby" sent a jolt of panic through Olivia. She remembered the doctor's unsettling behavior—claiming to care for the child while his actions suggested otherwise.

She pulled the blanket over her head, pretending to be asleep. Then, the voice at the door softened. "Olivia, it's Beatrice. Surely you remember me?"

Beatrice? Olivia hesitated before slowly lowering the blanket. Perhaps her exhaustion had dulled her senses. She quickly rose and opened the door.

Beatrice's eyes filled with concern the moment she saw Olivia. "My dear, you've lost so much weight."

It was true. Despite forcing herself to eat for the baby's sake, Olivia had grown alarmingly thin. Morning sickness and stress had whittled her down. At three months pregnant, her slender frame barely showed beneath her loose clothes. She offered Beatrice a weak smile, gesturing that she was fine.

Beatrice set the soup on the table, dabbing her eyes. "I understand your fear, but please, try this. I made it especially for you. I was overjoyed when I heard about your pregnancy."

Olivia froze. Liam had shown no interest in this child. She assumed he'd kept it secret, yet even the staff knew. Too drained to question his motives, she accepted the soup gratefully.

The warmth brought faint color back to her cheeks.

Beatrice, oblivious to the tension between Olivia and Liam, added gently, "Mr. Blackwood does care, in his own way. He's been consulting doctors about your health."

Clang! Olivia's hand jerked, sending the bowl crashing to the floor.

She stared at Beatrice in horror. Doctors? Not for the baby—he'd promised to wait. Was he changing his mind?

Beatrice gasped. "Are you all right?"

Olivia shook her head, forcing composure. She gestured that she was simply exhausted and needed rest. Beatrice hesitated but finally left, casting one last worried glance.

Alone, Olivia's mind raced. She resolved to confront Liam tomorrow.

Meanwhile, Liam's room blazed with light, thick with tension. A team of doctors stood around his bed, their expressions grim.

Liam's veins bulged at his temples, his body rigid with pain. Normally a master of control, he now writhed, sweat soaking his sheets. His knuckles whitened as he gripped the fabric, nearly tearing it apart.

Sebastian watched anxiously. These were elite specialists, yet they seemed powerless.

"Is there truly nothing you can do?" Sebastian pressed.

One doctor shook his head helplessly. "This neurotoxin is unlike anything we've seen. We need advanced equipment from Eldermere to analyze it properly."

"Useless!" Liam snarled through gritted teeth. Leaving wasn't an option—too many enemies watched.

Sebastian signaled the doctor. "Administer the sedative and pain relief."

The doctor hesitated. "This is a temporary fix. It could worsen the condition long-term—"

"Now!" Liam demanded, his voice ragged.

Once the drugs took effect, Liam's breathing steadied slightly. Still dizzy, he pressed a hand to his forehead. "Dismiss them," he muttered. "You know what to say."

Sebastian nodded, ushering the doctors out.

Liam stared out the window, his expression icy. This torment had begun two weeks ago, after that pregnant employee lost her child. Someone had poisoned him—a man who prided himself on vigilance.

The pain was relentless, like thousands of ants devouring his brain. Worse than the agony was the fear of vulnerability. His enemies would pounce at the first sign of weakness.

Later, Liam found fleeting relief in whiskey. It dulled the torment, if only for a while.

###Chapter 161

The discovery that liquor numbed his suffering had turned Liam Blackwood into a frequent patron of the bottle. Yet each morning's sobriety brought the agony rushing back with renewed vengeance.

Sebastian Montgomery watched Liam's slow deterioration with conflicted emotions. "Mr. Blackwood, I understand your distress, but alcohol isn't the answer. Look what it's doing to you."

Liam's eyelids fluttered open, irritation flashing in his gaze. "What? You think I'm dying?"

Sebastian bit back his immediate response, choosing diplomacy instead. "The physicians have valid concerns. Perhaps you should consider—"

"Sebastian!" Liam's voice cut like a whip. "One more word about this and you're fired on the spot. Understood?"

The assistant exhaled silently. His thoughts turned to Olivia Sinclair—perhaps the only person who could reach Liam now.

Noticing Sebastian's contemplative expression, Liam's piercing stare intensified. "If you even consider telling Olivia, termination will be the least of your worries. This stays between us. She's close to Alexander—that complicates everything."

Sebastian understood the unspoken truth. This wasn't merely about secrecy—Liam wanted to shield Olivia from worry.

With a respectful nod, Sebastian let the matter drop.

The night deepened, prompting Sebastian to arrange accommodations for the medical team in the villa, scheduling their departure for dawn.

Meanwhile, Julian Hawthorne remained kneeling outside throughout the night. By morning, exhaustion had claimed him, leaving the disheveled man collapsed on the cold ground.

Restless thoughts had robbed Olivia of sleep. At first light, curiosity drove her to investigate the physicians' presence.

Stepping onto the terrace, Olivia froze at the sight of a prone figure outside the villa.

Hearing approaching footsteps, she ducked into an adjacent room, holding her breath as the sounds passed her hiding place. When silence returned, she cracked the door open—just as the first raindrops began to fall.

The icy drizzle roused Julian from his stupor. Rising stiffly, he grimaced at his ruined appearance without needing a mirror.

Bitterness flooded his veins. Despite rumors of Liam's mercurial temperament, he'd hoped for preferential treatment.

Liam's silence the previous night had fueled Julian's hope of eventual invitation. Yet dawn found him still discarded like trash.

During his time with the Whitmores, Julian had enjoyed privilege as the sole male heir. His return to the affluent Hawthorne estate had brought only indulgence—such humiliation was foreign to him.

The degradation stung, yet fear of Alexander's retribution kept him rooted. His muttered curses grew louder until polished leather shoes materialized before him.

Looking up, Julian met Liam's glacial stare.

Liam's lips curled in a dangerous smile. "You seem displeased. Your curses carried quite far. Care to share your grievances?"

Julian trembled under that mocking gaze. "N-no, not you! I was cursing my own incompetence for letting Alexander corner me like this."

The contrast between them was stark—Julian's bedraggled form against Liam's effortless elegance in casual designer wear.

Envy burned through Julian. He craved the power Liam wielded so effortlessly—yearned to usurp Alexander's position.

"Why shouldn't I have shares and authority too?" Julian muttered, madness glinting in his eyes.

Unfazed by Julian's turbulent emotions, Liam gestured. An assistant materialized with a chair while bodyguards stood at attention beneath umbrellas—none extended to Julian, by obvious design.

Though seething, Julian forced an obsequious smile. "Mr. Blackwood, might you help me?"

"Let me guess—you want Alexander destroyed?" Liam countered.

Julian nodded eagerly. "Yes! He's gone too far. I wouldn't have come to you otherwise—"

His words ended abruptly as a bodyguard's kick sent him sprawling. "Answer directly. No rambling," the guard growled.

Julian scrambled upright, babbling apologies.

Liam's question came like a blade: "What can you tell me about Alexander?"

"William is his weakness. And he's quite taken with Olivia—though I can't gauge her true importance," Julian whispered.

Liam's eyes narrowed to slits. "From your observation, how close are they?"

Julian leaned closer. "I sent you those photos and videos. They're authentic—have them verified if you doubt me."

Confidence oozed from every pore.

The mention of those images sent fury coursing through Liam's veins—snapshots of Alexander and Olivia sharing lunch, radiating joy.

Olivia's smile in those photos—so bright, so free—was one she hadn't shown her husband in months.

An arctic chill settled over Liam, his presence growing lethally still.

Julian, oblivious to the storm he'd unleashed, wisely kept silent.

After an eternity, Liam spoke: "I'll arrange your return. In days, I'll initiate a venture with the Whitmores—you'll oversee it. Alexander won't dare touch you then."

Julian nearly wept with gratitude. "Thank you, Mr. Blackwood! I'm eternally in your debt."

"Get out," Liam dismissed him with a flick of his wrist.

As Julian scurried away, Sebastian's lip curled. "I expected more intelligence from him."

Liam offered a thin smile. "You're the only one who truly understands."

Generations of partnership between Blackwoods and Whitmores meant Liam and Alexander's rivalry wouldn't disrupt business.

Sacrificing interests for Julian's sake made no sense—Alexander would recognize the strategy immediately.
###Chapter 162

Olivia Sinclair stood frozen in the shadows, her delicate fingers pressed tightly against her parted lips.

The revelation hit her like a physical blow. Julian Hawthorne had been Liam Blackwood's puppet all along.

Her mind reeled. Why would Liam orchestrate such elaborate schemes? She had believed their conflict was personal, yet Alexander Hayes had been dragged into this mess completely innocent.

White-hot anger surged through Olivia's veins, her fists clenching at her sides. Every fiber of her being screamed to confront Liam immediately.

But then she hesitated.

Liam's mercurial temper was legendary. Mentioning Alexander might only pour gasoline on the flames. There was no predicting how he would react.

Taking a steadying breath, Olivia resolved to warn Alexander discreetly about both Julian and Liam's machinations.

When the coast was clear, Olivia slipped from her hiding place.

The grandfather clock chimed midnight. The medical team had already departed.

She questioned the staff about the unusual visit, but their tight-lipped responses revealed nothing.

Were they truly ignorant or deliberately withholding information? Olivia's stomach twisted with unease about what fresh hell awaited her.

Suddenly, the tense silence shattered.

"Liam Blackwood!" A shrill voice echoed through the marble foyer. "How dare you ignore me? Unless you want my wrath raining down on you, you'll make this right immediately!"

Evelyn Hartley stormed in like a hurricane, her crimson gown swirling around her. Her venomous gaze locked onto Olivia.

Olivia turned to leave, but Evelyn moved with predatory speed.

"Olivia," Evelyn purred, blocking her path with a saccharine smile that didn't reach her cold eyes. "What an unexpected... pleasure."

The hatred radiating from Evelyn was palpable. The memories of her forced exile still burned fresh.

In Evelyn's twisted logic, Liam couldn't possibly reject her willingly. This had to be Olivia's doing. As Liam's wife, Olivia held influence over public perception.

To Evelyn, only Olivia deserved blame.

Olivia met Evelyn's glare with icy indifference and gestured for her to move.

Evelyn's smirk widened as she crossed her arms. "Surprised to see me standing tall while you wither away? Some people are simply born to grovel at my feet."

Olivia arched one perfect eyebrow and signed that she'd already filed for divorce, implying Evelyn should leave her in peace.

Evelyn struggled to decipher the gestures but caught the word "divorce."

Misinterpreting Olivia's meaning, Evelyn's face contorted with rage. She struck Olivia with a vicious slap that echoed through the hall.

Olivia staggered back, clutching her stinging cheek in shock.

"You'll regret crossing me, Olivia!" Evelyn hissed. "When Liam finally discards you, I'll make sure you suffer tenfold for every slight!"

Memories of past humiliations flooded Olivia's mind, her skin prickling with cold sweat.

Why wouldn't they just let her go? Was bloodshed the only way out?

For the first time, a spark of dark fury ignited in Olivia's sapphire eyes.

"Evelyn." Liam's voice cut through the tension like a blade.

He stood on the grand staircase, his inscrutable gaze flickering between them. How much had he witnessed?

Evelyn instantly transformed, her features melting into a mask of wounded innocence. "Liam! She provoked me! The things she said—"

Crocodile tears spilled down Evelyn's cheeks as she painted herself the victim.

Olivia remained silent, refusing to meet Liam's eyes. What was the point? He'd never take her side against his precious Evelyn.

Yet unbeknownst to Olivia, Liam's attention never wavered from her, his expression unreadable.

Finally, Liam offered Evelyn a charming smile. "Don't trouble yourself. I know your heart. Come upstairs."

Evelyn practically vibrated with triumph. She shoved past Olivia with unnecessary force, whispering, "You're finished."

As Olivia turned to leave, their voices carried clearly:

"Liam, why have you been avoiding me? I've missed you terribly."

"Business kept me occupied. But I'll make it up to you. Remember that limited edition Valtierra sports car you admired? It's being shipped as we speak."

Evelyn gasped theatrically. "But that's impossible to acquire here!"

"Nothing's impossible for you, darling," Liam replied smoothly. "Consider it yours."

Evelyn's squeals of delight turned Olivia's stomach.

Yet oddly, Liam maintained physical distance from Evelyn.

Blind to his reluctance, Evelyn clung to his arm, sighing contentedly. "I'm the luckiest woman alive."

Had she looked closer, she might have seen the revulsion in Liam's eyes.

Every word carved deeper into Olivia's heart. A sports car flown in from another country—such a quintessential Liam Blackwood gesture. A public declaration that Evelyn was his chosen one.

And what was Olivia? The punchline to some cruel joke. An easy target because she had no one in her corner.

Her hand drifted to her stomach. What kind of mother brought a child into this vipers' nest?

There had to be a way out.

For now, she would endure until her baby was born. Then she would disappear with her child forever.

###Chapter 163

The rain poured relentlessly outside, turning the world into a blur of gray. Olivia Sinclair had been avoiding Liam Blackwood for days, though they still lived under the same roof. Their paths crossed less frequently now, but when they did, Olivia's expression remained frozen in perfect indifference.

A bitter wind howled through the hallway as they met by chance that afternoon. The chill seeped through Olivia's clothes, but it was nothing compared to the ice in her veins. She maintained her composed facade, though Liam's detached gaze sent sharp pains through her chest.

Liam's eyes flickered toward her. "Need something?" His tone was casual, as if speaking to a stranger.

In truth, Olivia had sought him out deliberately. Drawing a steadying breath, she gestured her growing restlessness - the walls of the mansion felt like they were closing in. She needed to leave, even if just temporarily.

Liam's lips thinned into a line. Silence stretched between them.

Olivia's fingers moved more urgently now. She promised to remain within city limits. If he distrusted her, she wouldn't object to having a minder accompany her.

"Surveillance?" Liam's laugh held no warmth. "I only kept you here to keep Alexander Hayes in check. Run if you want. There's nowhere you could hide that I wouldn't find you."

The threat hung heavy in the air between them. Olivia knew he meant every word.

Her hands stilled. Slowly, she raised questioning eyes to his face.

A smirk twisted Liam's lips. "You can go. On one condition." His voice dropped to a dangerous purr. "First, you'll do something for me."

Olivia hesitated. Was this sudden permission just a whim? After a moment, she nodded cautiously - provided his demand wasn't unreasonable.

Liam turned on his heel, motioning for her to follow.

They were leaving just as Catherine Winslow arrived, hoping to intercept Liam. From her car, Catherine watched Olivia climb into Liam's vehicle, her manicured nails digging into the steering wheel.

This wasn't part of the plan. The doctor should have already informed Liam about Olivia's pregnancy - barely a month along. Given Liam's notorious temper, he should have thrown Olivia out by now.

Unless... unless he was starting to believe the child might be his.

Catherine's blood ran cold. Once the pregnancy progressed, the timeline would expose her lies. Liam would trace everything back to her.

She couldn't let that happen.

An icy determination settled over Catherine. That child couldn't be allowed to survive. Without proof, Olivia's accusations would mean nothing.

Composing herself, Catherine stepped out of the car - only to startle when a voice called out behind her.

"Can I help you?"

Turning, Catherine found herself face-to-face with Evelyn Hartley. The woman was stunning, but her sharp eyes betrayed a calculating nature. Birds of a feather, Catherine thought.

A plan formed instantly. "You must be Evelyn," Catherine said warmly. "I'm Catherine, Liam's sister-in-law. His mother hasn't been well, and I came to persuade him to visit."

Evelyn's demeanor softened immediately. "His sister-in-law? Please, come inside."

As Evelyn played hostess, Catherine hid her contempt. Mistresses were beneath her, but she needed Evelyn's cooperation now.

Once seated, Evelyn leaned forward eagerly. "We've never met, yet you recognized me. Does Liam... speak of me often?"

Catherine feigned hesitation. "Well... yes. The family always wished you and Liam had married." She sighed dramatically. "But Olivia... well, she throws such fits whenever your name comes up."

Evelyn's smile faltered. "Fits?"

"Tantrums, really." Catherine lowered her voice conspiratorially. "She may be mute, but her temper is legendary. Before their marriage, she threatened any woman who came near Liam. As the adopted Reeves daughter, she had leverage. We were powerless."

"That bitch!" Evelyn slammed her hand on the table, her face contorted with rage.

Catherine hid her satisfaction behind a sympathetic mask. "After talking with you, I feel we understand each other. But I fear you may never have a future with Liam now."

Evelyn's eyes flashed with panic. "Why not? Liam loves me! It's only because he hasn't divorced her yet!"

"It's not that," Catherine said gravely. "Liam's keeping Olivia here for reasons you might find... difficult to accept."

Evelyn's breath hitched. "Is she... pregnant?"

Catherine simply nodded.

After Catherine left, Evelyn's scream of rage echoed through the mansion. Glass shattered as she hurled a vase against the wall. In her mind's eye, she saw herself wrapping her hands around Olivia's throat, watching the life drain from those traitorous eyes.

Pregnant. That explained everything. That was why Olivia refused to leave.

The thought burned through Evelyn like acid. She wouldn't allow it. She couldn't.

Not while she still drew breath.
###Chapter 164

Olivia's turbulent emotions gradually settled, her initial rage cooling into something more calculated. She understood the child Evelyn carried needed to be addressed, but direct confrontation might play right into her rival's hands.

It was common knowledge that while love might fade, guilt could forge unbreakable chains between people.

With this realization, Olivia decided to leave strategic gaps in her defenses, inviting Evelyn to make her move.

Meanwhile, in the backseat of the luxury car, Olivia Sinclair was convinced Liam Blackwood was taking her to some disreputable location. Fear coiled in her stomach throughout the entire ride.

To her astonishment, they pulled up at Newport's most exclusive shopping center - the crown jewel of Blackwood Enterprises' retail empire, housing only the most prestigious designer boutiques.

During their marriage, Liam had given Olivia a black card with unlimited spending privileges here, the ultimate status symbol.

Though their union lacked warmth, Liam had never stinted on material comforts.

Now Olivia bitterly regretted not using that card to its full potential during their marriage.

As they entered the gleaming marble lobby, Olivia remained suspicious of Liam's motives. She followed him to the third floor, where haute couture boutiques lined the corridors.

Liam strode into a jewelry salon where a sales associate immediately approached. "Good afternoon, sir. Shopping for something special today?"

His response was glacial. "Is the entire staff incompetent? I don't require your assistance. Send someone qualified."

The associate froze, bewildered by his hostility.

The manager, recognizing Liam, swiftly intervened. "Attend to other clients and don't disturb Mr. Blackwood."

Ushering them into the private VIP lounge, the manager presented a velvet case. "Our latest collection, Mr. Blackwood. Please take your time."

Liam pushed the case toward Olivia. "Choose."

Confused, Olivia gestured questioningly.

"Stop that," Liam snapped. "I don't want to see your hands moving."

Olivia exhaled sharply and pulled out her phone. [What do you mean?]

His response was deceptively calm. "Isn't it obvious? I'm selecting a gift. Since you might have better taste than me."

The implication stung. Was this for Evelyn? Knowing their history, Liam was deliberately humiliating her by making her choose gifts for her rival.

Olivia's fingers flew across her screen. [I'm hardly familiar with Miss Hartley's tastes. You'd know better than I would.]

Liam's smile didn't reach his eyes. "Then I suppose you've lost interest in visiting Alexander?"

Olivia's breath caught. How had he known about her plans to see Alexander?

Her shocked expression seemed to amuse him. "Jerome's condition has improved remarkably. Walking already. Naturally, you'd want to visit your dear friends."

At this news, genuine joy lit Olivia's face. She nearly leapt up before forcing herself back down, struggling to contain her excitement.

She'd visit Alexander first, then check on Jerome at Mercy Hospital. Discussing it with Liam would only invite cruel mockery.

Liam studied her reactions like a scientist observing lab rats. "Not the real reason then," he mused. "You're eager to see Alexander. How transparent."

Olivia typed furiously. [What concern is it of yours who I visit?]

Liam's jaw tightened. "I'm your husband. Everything about you concerns me."

Her response was immediate and defiant. [In name only. We both want this farce ended. And for the record, there's nothing between Alexander and me, despite your twisted imagination.]

Liam's eyes darkened dangerously. He gestured to the jewelry. "Choose quickly if you want to leave. If I dislike your selections, we start over."

Olivia understood his game - he was stalling to prevent her meeting. No time to analyze his motives.

Select gifts for Evelyn? Hardly.

Instead, Olivia chose pieces that appealed to her own taste, making swift decisions on the tablet. Within minutes, she'd finished and handed it back.

Liam barely glanced at her selections before signaling a bodyguard to process the purchases.

They repeated this pattern at a shoe boutique and designer store, with Olivia consistently selecting items completely unlike Evelyn's style.

Liam showed no reaction, casually approving each extravagant purchase.

His behavior puzzled Olivia. Was this some elaborate mind game? It seemed juvenile.

When they finished, Liam didn't immediately leave. "How do I know you didn't just pick randomly? Try them on."

Olivia shook her head, typing rapidly. [No. This is a setup. If Evelyn sees me wearing these, you'll claim I stole them.]

Liam's laugh was cold. "Do you really think I'd waste my time on such pettiness?"

At his signal, bodyguards nudged Olivia and her shopping bags toward the dressing room.

Trapped, Olivia changed into each outfit under their watchful eyes.

When she finally emerged, a full-length mirror confronted her.

Olivia froze, startled by her reflection. The emerald green dress complemented her complexion perfectly, the gold jewelry adding just the right accent. The ensemble looked... stunning.

The realization unsettled her more than anything else that day.
###Chapter 165

Olivia's auburn locks were artfully arranged in an intricate updo, accentuating her delicate features with refined grace. The transformation made her catch her breath.

Staring at her reflection, Olivia felt a strange disconnect. It had been years since she'd seen herself look so... alive.

The sight transported her back to her early days with the Blackwood family. When Henry was still alive, they'd treated her with distant courtesy. Her relationship with Liam hadn't yet curdled into bitterness.

Margaret Winslow had always made her disapproval clear. The matriarch would pointedly exclude Olivia from society events, as if her presence brought shame to the Blackwood name.

Yet Liam would sweep in like a knight, dressing her in couture and presenting her proudly as Henry's ward at every gala. His defiance both thrilled and terrified her.

Margaret's silent fury would later manifest in icy glares and veiled insults over tea. Olivia learned to weather these storms with quiet dignity.

Those bittersweet memories tugged at Olivia's heart. The happiness felt so close yet impossibly distant - like trying to grasp smoke.

"Must you take forever admiring yourself?" Liam's sharp tone shattered her reverie.

He stood in the doorway, his piercing gaze tracking her every movement. Something unreadable flickered in his storm-gray eyes before vanishing.

After a thorough inspection, Liam delivered his verdict with characteristic bluntness. "The dress is tolerable. Though your accessory choices remain questionable."

Olivia signed a question about whether Evelyn would approve of the ensemble.

"That's irrelevant," Liam countered, his lips twisting in that familiar smirk. "Change back now."

As she turned toward the dressing room, Liam suddenly swayed on his feet.

His phone chose that moment to ring. Evelyn's name flashed on the screen.

"Liam darling," came the saccharine voice through the speaker. "Where are you? We need to discuss something important."

He pressed fingers to his temple, fighting the migraine threatening to split his skull. "Get to the point."

A petulant sigh. "My birthday's coming up. I don't want some stuffy party this year. Just an intimate gathering at Blackwood Manor?"

Liam's laugh held no warmth. "Planning to redecorate as mistress of the house already?"

Undeterred, Evelyn pressed on. "I just want you there. Unless you'd rather not celebrate with me?"

The prolonged silence made her breath hitch.

Finally, Liam relented. "Tell Sebastian what you need. Just spare me the details."

Evelyn's triumphant smile practically traveled through the phone. Hosting at the manor would force Margaret and Catherine to attend - a tacit acknowledgment of her future position.

She dismissed Olivia's pregnancy as inconsequential. Many things could happen before that bastard drew breath.

Olivia emerged just in time to catch Liam's arrangements. The conversation flowed freely, as if her presence meant nothing.

Her chest constricted painfully. She had no right to object to their plans. Not anymore.

Memories surfaced of birthdays past - quiet celebrations with Henry and Liam before her world fractured. Margaret had barely tolerated her presence even then.

Now Evelyn would occupy that privileged space.

Liam's migraine had reduced his patience to tatters. Spotting Olivia, he snapped, "Eavesdropping again?"

Her hands flew in denial, promising to make herself scarce that day.

His laugh was cruel. "You misunderstand. Your attendance isn't optional."

Ice flooded Olivia's veins. Was this deliberate cruelty? Her signing grew sharp. What if she refused?

If they wanted their perfect celebration, they shouldn't force her participation.

Liam moved with predatory grace, seizing her wrist. "Remember your place. You're here for Alexander's sake. A bargaining chip has no rights."

The bitterness nearly choked her. This cold stranger bore no resemblance to the Liam she once knew.

His grip tightened unconsciously until she winced. Only then did he release her, turning away to hide his ashen face.

"Leave. Unless you want to test how thoroughly I can confine you."

Olivia had barely taken three steps when a crash echoed behind her. Gasps filled the air.

Her blood turned to ice.

Spinning around, she found Liam collapsed on the marble floor, his complexion deathly pale.

In that terrifying moment, Olivia saw past their animosity. She sprinted for Sebastian.

The ever-efficient assistant mobilized immediately, whisking Liam to Mercy Hospital with military precision.

Olivia intercepted Sebastian before he could leave. Her signing was urgent - what wasn't he telling her?

"Just exhaustion and stress," came the practiced reply. "Acute gastritis from skipping meals. He'll recover with rest."

But Olivia knew Liam's limits. She'd seen him work seventy-two hour stretches without collapsing like this. Something was terribly wrong.

The truth hovered just beyond reach, more frightening than any of their confrontations. Whatever plagued Liam went far deeper than overwork.

And Olivia feared she might be the only one who cared enough to uncover it.
###Chapter 166

Olivia glanced up and caught the troubled look on Sebastian's face. She didn't push for answers. If he was keeping silent, it meant Liam had ordered him to.

A shadow flickered across Olivia's expression as she nodded in silent understanding. She wouldn't pry.

"Take good care of Liam," Olivia signed before turning to leave. She had other matters to attend to.

Sebastian gave a tense nod. "Let me arrange your transportation," he offered.

Footsteps suddenly echoed through the corridor.

"You witch! What have you done to my son?" Margaret Winslow stormed in, her palm connecting sharply with Olivia's cheek before anyone could react.

The slap rang out, stunning everyone present.

Even Sebastian hadn't anticipated the sudden attack as Margaret arrived with her entourage. His headache intensified. How had news spread so fast?

Bodyguards immediately moved to shield Olivia.

Sebastian stepped forward with practiced diplomacy. "Mrs. Winslow, please remain calm. Mr. Blackwood simply collapsed from exhaustion. Olivia had nothing to do with it."

"Do you take me for a fool?" Margaret's eyes blazed with accusation. "Evelyn told me everything! This scheming woman has been tormenting my son for weeks, causing him sleepless nights! And today - who knows what poison she fed him during their outing?"

Her icy glare turned to Olivia. "I know about the divorce. I've heard you've already found another man. Liam probably wants you to leave with nothing, so you're trying to harm him, aren't you?"

Olivia touched her stinging cheek. Margaret's imagination never ceased to amaze her - how easily she spun elaborate tales from thin air.

Pushing past the bodyguard, Olivia stood firm before Margaret and typed: "You think I'd hurt Liam for money?"

Margaret scoffed. "What other reason could there be?"

Olivia's fingers flew across her phone. "If money mattered to me, you wouldn't have gotten your hands on those assets years ago."

Margaret's expression faltered momentarily with guilt.

Before Henry Winslow passed, he'd left Olivia a substantial inheritance - cash, businesses, properties. No one understood why the old man had been so generous to her.

The envy had caused endless arguments between Margaret and Liam.

Though their relationship was already strained during their engagement, Liam had honored his grandfather's wishes. The assets belonged to Olivia, period.

Unable to bear watching Liam caught in the middle, Olivia had voluntarily surrendered most of the inheritance, keeping only a portion of the money.

If she truly cared about wealth, she wouldn't have given up so much. Over the years, she'd endured Margaret's constant bullying and cold treatment.

Under Olivia's steady gaze, Margaret shifted uncomfortably but doubled down. "Who knows what you were really thinking? Maybe it was all an act to secure your position as Mrs. Blackwood. I've met plenty of gold diggers like you."

She added sharply, "I've already called the police."

Catherine Winslow sneered, "Why waste words? Let the authorities handle her. They'll uncover whatever she's done."

"The police?" Sebastian's eyes narrowed. This was escalating dangerously.

Olivia typed calmly: "I'll wait here for them."

Margaret shot her a venomous look before rushing toward Liam's room.

Evelyn paused as she passed Olivia, arms crossed. "See? I suggested calling the police. I told them you probably poisoned Liam. Everyone believed me instantly - even your in-laws. Who would take your side?"

Olivia simply signed that Evelyn was an idiot.

Confused, Evelyn looked to Sebastian for translation.

Understanding Olivia's gesture, Sebastian gave Evelyn a frosty look. "Miss Hartley, so it was your idea to involve the police. Just know Mr. Blackwood won't be pleased when he wakes."

Evelyn bristled. "Why would he be angry? I'm protecting him! They went out together, and now he's unconscious while she's perfectly fine."

Olivia ignored Evelyn's rant, which only infuriated her more.

Striding forward in her designer heels, Evelyn leaned close to whisper, "I've arranged a little surprise for you outside. Once the police take you away, by tomorrow everyone will know you tried to murder Liam out of jealousy. You'll be the villain. And when he divorces you? Not a single penny."

Olivia remained unruffled as she typed: "Things won't go as you planned."

She was certain Liam would intervene if necessary.

While Evelyn remained oblivious, Olivia understood the situation perfectly.

It wasn't about intelligence - her years with Liam gave her insight into his world.

When Liam collapsed, Sebastian hadn't called an ambulance but took him directly to Mercy Hospital. The medical team's efficiency suggested this wasn't their first emergency with Liam.

Sebastian's secrecy about Liam's condition told Olivia this was a private health matter not meant for public knowledge.

Yet Evelyn, in her zeal to destroy Olivia, had broadcast the incident citywide.

Olivia didn't know how Liam would react to Evelyn's meddling, but she was certain he'd quash any damaging rumors. She had nothing to fear.

Right on cue, the police arrived.

Olivia cooperated fully.

As expected, Evelyn had summoned a horde of reporters to the scene.
###Chapter 167

The instant Olivia stepped through the police station doors, a swarm of paparazzi descended like vultures. Their camera flashes exploded in rapid succession, capturing her every move as officers guided her toward the waiting patrol car.

The spectacle could have rivaled the arrest of a notorious crime lord, drawing gasps and whispers from bystanders.

"Is that a serial killer they're taking in?"

"Worse," a bystander muttered. "They say she tried poisoning her wealthy husband when he refused to give her money in their divorce."

"No way! She looks so... fragile."

"Don't be fooled by appearances. Women like her use their beauty as weapons. That poor man probably suffered for years."

At Mercy Hospital's precinct, officers immediately ushered Olivia into interrogation.

Since she couldn't speak, they summoned a sign language interpreter within minutes.

After Olivia finished explaining through gestures, the lead detective sighed. "Your story checks out preliminarily, but we can't release you yet. The attempted murder accusation is serious - they claim you poisoned Liam during your marriage. We're awaiting toxicology reports."

Olivia merely nodded. She knew the medical records wouldn't clear her easily. Liam's mysterious condition was a closely guarded secret among his inner circle.

Resigned to her temporary captivity, Olivia rested her head on the cold metal table.

She startled awake hours later when an officer rapped sharply on the table. "Olivia Sinclair? You've made bail. You're free to go."

Bleary-eyed, she checked the wall clock - 2:47 AM. Liam must have pulled strings quickly.

But when she stepped into the lobby, it wasn't Liam waiting, but Alexander.

Alexander's face was etched with concern as he rushed forward.

"Thank God you're alright. I came as soon as I heard. I've retained Nathaniel Bradford - top criminal attorney in Newport. Even if Liam pushes for prosecution, we'll fight this."

Olivia's throat tightened with gratitude. She signed her thanks.

Her fingers flew across her phone screen: You believe I'm innocent? Even after what they're accusing me of?

Alexander shook his head firmly. "I've known you since university. You'd never harm anyone for money." A wry smile touched his lips. "Now, if you'd done it out of spite? That I might believe."

Olivia's lips quirked despite herself.

"Come on," Alexander gestured toward the exit. "Let's get you home."

"Not so fast."

Liam's voice cut through the lobby like winter wind. He strode forward flanked by security, his pallor concerning but improved from earlier.

When Liam and Alexander stood face-to-face, neither man yielded an inch.

Liam's gaze turned arctic. "Mr. Hayes, this is a private family matter. Since when do you enjoy inserting yourself where you don't belong?"

Alexander held his ground. "I'm not inserting myself anywhere. Ask yourself - what has Olivia endured because of you? I don't care why you were hospitalized, but I know she had nothing to do with it. Your people seem more interested in tormenting her than your recovery."

Liam remained unmoved. "And yet, Mr. Hayes, consider what Olivia exchanged for her freedom. Who truly exploited her? You claim to protect her, but lack the means to do so."

Alexander's fists clenched, guilt and frustration warring in his expression. What could he say? No one could have predicted this outcome.

Before Alexander could respond, Liam seized Olivia's wrist. "You're coming with me."

Olivia twisted free effortlessly. Her hands moved sharply: Did you know Evelyn sent me here?

Liam's brow furrowed. "I'm aware. Your point?"

A bitter smile touched Olivia's lips as she signed one final dismissive gesture.

Turning to Alexander, she typed rapidly: Take me home. I've been here for hours and need rest.

She could feel Liam's glacial stare boring into her back but refused to glance his way.

Three steps from the exit, Olivia paused. She sent Liam one final message: I'll attend Evelyn's birthday. I keep my promises. See that you keep yours.

Liam could only watch, jaw clenched, as Olivia slid into Alexander's car and disappeared into the night.

A sudden coughing fit wracked Liam's frame, leaving him trembling.

Sebastian rushed to his side. "Mr. Blackwood! The doctors insisted on bed rest. After today's collapse, we don't know what might—"

"Enough," Liam rasped, regaining his composure. "Take me to the car."

Once inside, Liam pressed his fingertips to his temples, breathing slowly.

Sebastian started the engine toward Mercy Hospital before Liam stopped him. "Not there. The media's camped outside thanks to Evelyn's stupidity. You want my medical records becoming tabloid fodder?"

Understanding, Sebastian changed course. "I didn't tell Olivia the truth, yet she seemed to know something was wrong. Miss Hartley overstepped today - targeting Olivia while completely disregarding your condition. What's our move?"

"Keep her close for now," Liam's eyes glinted dangerously. "She may prove useful later."

Upon arriving home, Liam went straight to his study, ignoring Evelyn's tearful pleas in the foyer.

"Liam, please! I was manipulated into calling the police! Let me explain—"

The study door slammed shut.
###Chapter 168

The night air was thick with Evelyn's sobs, yet Liam's door remained firmly closed, his indifference cutting deeper than any words.

As midnight faded into the early hours, her cries dissolved into exhausted silence.

Pressed against the unyielding marble floor, bitterness crystallized in Evelyn's gaze. Did Liam ever truly love her? His cold rejection answered louder than any declaration. How could someone be so cruel?

Her mind whirled with possibilities. Was it her treatment of Olivia that turned him away? Did Liam secretly harbor feelings for the woman carrying his child? Where did that leave her? Forever the mistress, never the wife?

A violent shiver wracked her body as these thoughts took root.

Then - a spark of defiance. No. This wouldn't be her fate.

At dawn's first light, Sebastian approached. "Miss Hartley, Mr. Blackwood spoke in anger. Please, let me help you up," he offered, extending a hand.

Evelyn's expression darkened, yet curiosity won. "Did Liam send you?"

"Of course," Sebastian lied smoothly.

Relief flickered across her strained features.

Internally, Sebastian cursed. Liam still burned with fury over Evelyn's reckless actions that endangered Olivia.

Recognizing they couldn't risk Evelyn growing suspicious, he played his role carefully.

Once composed, Evelyn's dramatics returned. "But if Liam cared, he'd come himself! Maybe he's disgusted by me. Perhaps I should leave."

"Please," Sebastian interjected smoothly. "Mr. Blackwood isn't angry at you - just your thoughtlessness. When news of his illness spread because of your actions, it compromised everything. He needs a partner who understands strategy, not petty emotions."

Evelyn's eyes lit with sudden understanding.

"Sebastian, truthfully - is this what Liam wants?"

"Without question," he affirmed.

A blush colored Evelyn's cheeks as her smile blossomed. "So that's his thinking? How foolish I've been! I deserve his displeasure."

Sebastian barely suppressed his smirk. Only Evelyn would swallow such obvious lies.

Lost in her fantasy, Evelyn missed his amusement. To stand beside Liam, she must become his equal in every way.

New determination straightened her spine.

An idea struck. "Sebastian, I behaved terribly yesterday. Take me to Liam - I must apologize."

Though noting her calculating gaze, Sebastian nodded magnanimously. "Of course."

Then she hesitated. "No - not like this. I'll return home first to freshen up."

"As you wish," he agreed smoothly.

Buoyed by imagined victory, Evelyn grew bold. "I once thought you incompetent, but you've proven useful. I'd considered replacing you after our wedding, but perhaps I'll reconsider."

Sebastian's lips twitched at her arrogance.

"Youthful ignorance," he demurred. "Now I understand where true wisdom lies. Miss Hartley, allow me to redeem myself?"

Evelyn tilted her chin regally. "You may."

"Then permit me to escort you home?"

The woman who arrived in tearful desperation now departed with imperial dignity, Sebastian trailing respectfully.

The villa staff whispered:

"The marriage contract won't last now."

"Olivia Sinclair can't compete with Evelyn Hartley's pedigree."

"After yesterday's scandal, for Mr. Blackwood to forgive her? That's love."

At the gates, Evelyn dismissed Sebastian. "My driver's coming."

With a bow, Sebastian withdrew - but not far. From the shadows, he watched.

A black sedan arrived. Evelyn entered.

Unbeknownst to her, when Sebastian helped her up, he'd planted a listening device in her pocket. Now, every word transmitted clearly.

"How is Liam?" asked a nondescript male voice Sebastian couldn't place.

"It worked," Evelyn replied. "He's never lost control publicly before."

"Monitor his condition closely," the man instructed.

Evelyn hesitated. "We should wait. Liam grew suspicious yesterday."

The man scoffed. "Sentimentality will ruin everything. Remember your family's stake in this. When you drugged Liam, was it strategy - or jealousy over Olivia?"

Evelyn's silence spoke volumes.

"You'll follow orders," the man commanded.

The line went dead.

Sebastian's grip tightened on his phone. This was worse than they'd imagined.
###Chapter 169

"I see," Olivia murmured, though uncertainty laced her voice.

The stranger's tone remained steady as he continued. "Strange, isn't it? Now that Liam showers you with affection, it all feels...performative."

Olivia's spine stiffened. "His love is genuine! How dare you suggest otherwise?"

The man mentally labeled her a fool. Direct confrontation wouldn't serve his purposes; he needed her cooperation. Offending her would only complicate matters. Olivia still had unrestricted access to Liam without raising suspicion.

"Don't fret," the man soothed, easing the car to a stop. "If Liam's devotion is merely theater, then his true feelings must still belong to Evelyn. We can use that. When the time comes, we'll administer the same drug to her."

Olivia's face darkened. She flung the car door open, voice rising. "I'll prove Liam's love is real. Just wait until my gala next week!"

The man's lips curled knowingly. "I look forward to your demonstration."

His phone vibrated abruptly. The moment the caller ID flashed, his demeanor shifted to one of deference.

Olivia had already stormed away, leaving Sebastian too distant to overhear the conversation.

Frustration coiled in Sebastian's gut. He nearly hurled his earpiece to the pavement. He'd been moments from uncovering who'd drugged Liam.

Collecting himself, Sebastian smoothed his expression and strode toward Liam's suite.

He found Liam's condition markedly improved.

Liam sat propped against pillows, engrossed in a legal brief. Noting Sebastian's grim expression, he showed no surprise. "Olivia's involved, isn't she?"

Sebastian startled. "Mr. Blackwood, you knew?"

"Obviously," Liam replied, snapping the document shut. "I've sensed something amiss since Olivia returned. She used to wear her heart on her sleeve, desperate for my approval. Now she's secretive—whispered calls, covert messages. When I instructed you to surveil her today, I'd already connected the dots."

Sebastian's jaw tightened. "The Hartleys dared to drug you. Shouldn't we retaliate?"

Liam arched a brow. "You're slipping. Have you forgotten your training?"

Sebastian dipped his head, shame coloring his features. "My apologies, sir. I let anger cloud my judgment."

Liam's expression hardened. "The Hartleys lack both the courage and resources for this. They're puppets. Someone's exploiting my history with Olivia—those staged moments to provoke Evelyn's jealousy gave them the wrong impression. Even if we expose the Hartleys, the true architects will remain untouched. Acting now would only alert them."

Sebastian absorbed this, though fury still simmered. "But your health, sir? Should we continue the medication?"

Liam ignored the question. "You withheld parts of Olivia's conversation, didn't you?"

Sebastian shifted uncomfortably. "I...feared it would distress you."

With sudden violence, Liam hurled his brief at Sebastian.

The assistant didn't flinch. "Even if you strike me, sir, I stand by my decision. Your recovery takes precedence."

Liam exhaled sharply, his pallor stark under the dim lighting. "Your silence changes nothing. I've deduced their plan. If necessary, they'll drug Evelyn too."

Sebastian's eyes widened. "You anticipated that as well?"

Liam reclined against the pillows, lids falling shut. "Their strategy is transparent. That's why their initial trap succeeded. And don't mistake this for chivalry—they're targeting me. Dragging Evelyn into this is collateral damage."

Sebastian's frustration resurged. "If she discovers your role in—"

Liam barked a laugh. "She'd never believe it. To Evelyn, I'll always be the villain."

Meanwhile, at Mercy Hospital, Evelyn sneezed violently. Rubbing her arms against the chill, she blamed the aggressive air conditioning.

As she rose to adjust it, Eleanor burst in, alarm radiating from her.

"What are you doing?" Eleanor snapped. "Don't touch that."

Evelyn typed rapidly on her phone. "It's freezing. William just regained consciousness—this temperature risks pneumonia."

"Pneumonia?" Eleanor scoffed. "The doctors warned of heatstroke in this weather. My father's advanced age makes temperature regulation critical. Why are you here so frequently anyway?"

Her gaze raked over Evelyn with open suspicion.

Evelyn squirmed under the scrutiny, mindful she was on Whitmore territory and needed to maintain decorum.

"Enough!" William's rasp cut through the tension.

Evelyn brightened at his voice, moving toward the bed.

Earlier, the nurse had said William was sedated. Seeing him alert flooded her with relief.

But Eleanor intercepted her, shoving her aside.

"Father," Eleanor cooed, her smile brittle. "Any discomfort? Shall I have lunch brought up?"

William coughed weakly, waving her off.

Eleanor's protest carried a whine. "Why must I leave while she stays? The doctors restricted visitors. Alexander knows your condition yet insists on her presence—prioritizing some woman over family."

Evelyn studied Eleanor. The hostility seemed disproportionate. Had she offended her somehow?

Unless...this wasn't about her at all.

Perhaps Isabella was right—Alexander's position within the Whitmore family was indeed precarious.

William said nothing, just fixed Eleanor with a steely glare.

Eleanor wilted slightly, rising reluctantly.

###Chapter 170

The moment Eleanor Hawthorne stormed out, she hissed under her breath, "My father has truly lost his mind."

Once the door clicked shut behind her, Olivia Sinclair was overcome with guilt. She pressed a hand to her chest, her expression remorseful as she silently conveyed that she had wanted to visit sooner but had been tangled in too many obligations.

William Hayes gave her a tender smile, his voice warm but weary. "I understand, my dear. You've always been so kind to me. You must have been worried sick while I was ill."

Olivia's lips curved into a soft smile. She reassured him that the doctors were optimistic—with proper rest, he would recover fully and live many more years.

William sighed deeply before broaching the subject. "Alexander mentioned you're considering a different position within Whitmore Holdings. Do you feel the consultant role isn't suited for you?"

Olivia shook her head and quickly typed on her phone, then showed him the screen: "I struggle with communication. This role would be better suited for someone else. I'd prefer to focus on relic restoration. I also plan to return part of my salary to Alexander. You've all been so generous, and with Whitmore Holdings facing difficulties, I don’t want to burden you further."

"Nonsense," William snapped, his irritation triggering a harsh coughing fit.

Olivia rushed to his side, steadying him as she gently patted his back.

He shot her a look that was both exasperated and affectionate. "Why the formality? I already consider you my granddaughter. There’s no need to return your salary or change positions. Just do your best at work and leave the rest to me. I may be old, but my mind is sharp. I didn’t assign you this role without reason. If you refuse, it means you don’t trust me. Why even bother visiting, then?"

Olivia’s heart clenched at his words.

They said the elderly often regressed to childlike stubbornness, and perhaps there was truth in that.

Relenting, she promised to stay with Whitmore Holdings, which finally eased the tension in William’s expression.

He exhaled slowly. "Even if you weren’t with the company, I would still give you those twenty million. It’s a debt I owe you and Henry. This role is meant to ease your mind, not add to your worries. Work hard, Olivia. And if anyone mistreats you, tell me. Don’t suffer in silence like Alexander did. When I’m gone, he’ll lead this family. He’ll protect you. You have nothing to fear."

His grip on her hand tightened, his eyes filled with concern.

Tears pricked at Olivia’s lashes. She typed quickly: "Please don’t worry. You’ll recover. The doctor was very optimistic."

Eleanor, lingering just outside the door, had heard everything. Her face darkened as she muttered, "That mute witch?"

When Olivia stepped out, Eleanor shot her a venomous glare.

Olivia held onto William’s words.

He had confided in her about Eleanor and Julian’s misdeeds. Though aware, he felt powerless to stop them. Years ago, in a fit of rage, he had wounded Eleanor deeply, but she was still his daughter. Cutting ties was unthinkable.

If Eleanor showed remorse, he would maintain the fragile peace—only intervening if she crossed the line.

Olivia didn’t entirely agree.

Greed, she believed, was nurtured, not inherent.

Still, she remained silent, understanding the weight of William’s words. In old age, people yearned for their children’s love. If Eleanor changed, she and Julian could still have fulfilling lives. Their fate was in their own hands.

Back in the hospital room, Eleanor watched William take his medication before decisively dialing Julian’s number.

She didn’t hold back. "Julian, Olivia visited your grandfather today. I don’t understand what spell that mute has cast. She’s not even blood-related, yet your cousin defends her, and so does your grandfather."

Julian’s voice sharpened with concern. "Where are you now?"

Eleanor smirked. "In his hospital room. Don’t worry—he just took his medicine and is dead asleep. Even an earthquake wouldn’t wake him."

Julian exhaled sharply. "Mother, I’ve told you to be careful. Step outside if you need to talk."

Grumbling, Eleanor retreated to the bathroom. "I overheard William mention twenty million and supporting her. What does that mean? Is he planning to leave her part of his estate?"

She hadn’t caught everything, but the sum of twenty million stuck in her mind.

Julian’s tone turned urgent. "I thought William wouldn’t be so reckless, but now I’m not sure. He might not leave it directly to her, but he could increase Alexander’s share to ensure she’s taken care of."

Eleanor’s stomach twisted. "What do we do? Your grandfather never intended to give us anything, and now with Olivia in the picture, if he boosts Alexander’s inheritance because of her, we’ll be left with nothing!"

"Don’t worry," Julian soothed, his voice laced with dark intent. "We’ll ruin Olivia’s reputation so thoroughly that the Whitmores will cut all ties with her. Then, we’ll find a way to claim that twenty million for ourselves."

Eleanor brightened. "I’ll leave it to you. Don’t worry about the hospital—I have everything under control here."

After hanging up, Julian stared at the imposing gates of the Blackwood Villa.

With determined strides, he approached and knocked. When admitted, he wasted no time. "Is Mrs. Evelyn Hartley available?"

The servant relayed his request.

Evelyn, unfamiliar with the name, frowned. "The Hawthorne family? Do we know them?"

But the title Mrs. Hartley piqued her interest.

"Anyone who finds their way here must be significant," she mused. "Let him in."

Greeting Julian with practiced grace, Evelyn ushered him inside.

Julian lavished her with compliments, each word carefully crafted to stroke her ego.

Pleased, Evelyn finally arched a brow. "What brings you here? Are you hoping I’ll put in a good word for you with Liam? I’m afraid I can’t help you."

Julian shook his head smoothly. "Not at all. I’m here because we share a common enemy."

...

...
###Chapter 171

"A mutual enemy?" Evelyn's sharp gaze locked onto Julian, her voice dripping with skepticism. "You honestly believe we're on the same level?"

Julian masked his irritation beneath a polished smile. "Actually, my mother is a Clarke. We've only recently returned to the city to reconnect with the Whitmore family. That's why you might not recognize me. But you're certainly aware of Olivia's ties to them." He leaned in slightly, lowering his voice. "Frankly, we despise her. We can't fathom how she's manipulated my grandfather into favoring her. He's grown sentimental in his old age, bending to her every whim. Just this morning, she was at Mercy Hospital, coaxing him into leaving her a portion of his estate."

Evelyn's composure fractured. "What?"

The Whitmores weren't as powerful as the Blackwoods, but their wealth and influence were undeniable. Evelyn had assumed Olivia was merely a charity case—a pitiable mute the family indulged out of pity. The idea that William Whitmore would actually bequeath her anything was ludicrous.

Her voice turned shrill. "Has he lost his mind? Why would he leave anything to her? What could she possibly offer?"

Julian sighed theatrically. "Believe me, we're just as frustrated. But my grandfather's mind is made up. Still…" A calculated pause. "I think we can help each other turn this situation to our advantage."

Evelyn studied him warily. "Explain your plan first. Then I'll decide."

Julian obliged, whispering his scheme with cold precision.

A spark of excitement flickered in Evelyn's eyes.

Reading her hesitation, Julian pressed, "If you're having doubts, we can forget it. Regardless of Olivia's inheritance, I remain a Whitmore heir. My share is secure. But if she gains those assets, her status will skyrocket. Imagine what she could do to Liam then." He turned to leave.

Evelyn shot to her feet. "Wait."

Truthfully, her original plan had been similar—just less ruthless. Her backer was inflexible, unlikely to approve drastic measures. But if she borrowed Julian's methods discreetly… The end result would be the same. She just needed to see Olivia broken.

Taking a steadying breath, Evelyn met his gaze. "I'll work with you. But this has to succeed."

Julian smirked. "Naturally. I’ve no interest in failing."

As he walked away from Liam’s villa, satisfaction curled through him. Olivia wasn’t his only target. Alexander Whitmore was fiercely protective of her—if she fell, he’d surely stumble too. Now, he just needed Evelyn to play her part.

After visiting William at Mercy Hospital, Olivia headed to Whitmore Holdings.

Alexander and William had moved swiftly, preparing her new office within days.

Whispers trailed her the moment she stepped inside.

"A mute consultant? This is a joke."

"How does she even communicate? Sign language? That’s hardly professional."

"Careful. The Whitmores are shielding her now. One wrong word, and you’re out."

"Please. You think Mr. Whitmore would fire me over her? I hate nepotism hires."

Isabella, walking beside Olivia, tensed, shooting her a worried glance.

Olivia merely smiled and shook her head, unbothered. She gestured calmly—I heard. But anger is pointless.

Isabella huffed. "They don’t know you. Judging you like this is vile."

Olivia shrugged. Their resentment was understandable. In their eyes, she’d stolen a position they coveted. But words meant nothing. She’d prove herself through action.

The mockery grew bolder.

"Wait, is she deaf too?"

"Probably. Some mutes can’t hear either. Explains why she’s ignoring us."

"Pathetic. We could insult her to her face, and she wouldn’t even know."

Isabella whirled around, glaring at the speaker—Harrison Prescott.

Harrison smirked, unfazed. "Isabella, how’s it feel babysitting a deaf-mute?"

"Harrison," she shot back, "now that I’ve left, you must be thrilled about that manager promotion. Don’t get too comfortable. Gifts like this don’t come twice."

His face darkened. "You—!"

He clenched his fists but held back—they were still on company grounds.

Olivia turned suddenly, typing rapidly on her phone. A robotic voice echoed through the hall:

"Apologies for ruining your fun, but I’m not deaf. I heard every word. Also, as your superior, should I address your unprofessionalism now?"

Harrison stiffened. He’d assumed she was either impaired or spineless. This defiance was unexpected.

His jaw tightened. "Superior? I don’t acknowledge your authority."

Olivia’s smile didn’t waver as she typed again.

"Fortunately, your acknowledgment isn’t required. It’s already company policy."

Silence fell.

Harrison’s face flushed with humiliation.

The game had just begun.
###Chapter 172

"Don't you recognize her? Or is my decision not worthy of your respect?" Alexander stepped forward, his darkening expression radiating barely contained fury.

At the sight of Alexander, Harrison immediately straightened his posture, plastering on an obsequious smile. "Mr. Hayes, I was merely engaging in harmless banter with her. No offense intended."

Olivia released a scornful laugh, her fingers flying across her phone screen before showing it to Isabella. "Oh? So ridiculing someone's speech impairment and calling them a mute constitutes humor in your world? How amusing that you're not laughing now when the tables are turned."

Harrison's face flushed crimson, his eyes narrowing dangerously. "You're twisting my words!"

Alexander's voice turned glacial as he cut in, "Olivia is an honored addition to our team. If you have objections, I suggest you take them up with my grandfather personally."

Harrison hastily backtracked, "Mr. Hayes, I wouldn't presume—"

"Really? Because you seemed quite presumptuous moments ago," Alexander snapped.

Flustered, Harrison retreated. "I should attend to urgent matters. The project can't proceed without my oversight. The workload has me stretched thin. But rest assured, since this is your decision, I'll support it fully."

With that dramatic declaration, Harrison spun on his heel and marched away, deliberately projecting his voice for all to hear: "Everyone take note! Olivia Sinclair is our distinguished guest. Treat her with utmost respect—she's here for business, not manual labor."

His announcement strategically painted Olivia as a privileged outsider.

"That conniving snake," Alexander muttered through clenched teeth, his fists tightening at his sides.

Sensing Alexander's rising anger, Olivia quickly typed a message and showed it to him: "Let it go. Many assume I got this position through nepotism. It's fine—my work will prove my worth. William believed in me, and I won't disappoint him."

Alexander exhaled sharply, frustration simmering beneath his polished exterior. "Harrison has been with Whitmore Holdings for decades and knows every loophole. Since I assumed leadership, there's been constant resistance, and Harrison leads the opposition. He plays the loyal employee, but it's all theater. The man's a master manipulator. If he's targeting you, it means others disapprove of your presence too. I'll protect you when possible, but I can't be everywhere. If you encounter trouble, you must tell me immediately."

A wave of unexpected emotion washed over Olivia. She hadn't fully grasped that beneath Alexander's composed demeanor lay a battlefield of corporate intrigue and hidden threats.

The various factions within the Whitmore family weren't merely observing—they were actively waiting for Alexander to falter. Whitmore Holdings was a minefield of schemes orchestrated by rivals, all anticipating the family's downfall.

Now, every Whitmore family responsibility rested squarely on Alexander's shoulders. The weight he carried was palpable.

Olivia's thoughts briefly drifted to Liam. Was he enduring similar trials?

She quickly dismissed the notion. Liam was nothing like Alexander. He nursed grudges like prized possessions and tolerated no slights. His methods were ruthlessly direct. She resolved to focus on her own challenges rather than speculate about his.

Reassuring Alexander, Olivia typed: "Don't worry about me. I'll stay vigilant and won't add to your burdens."

Olivia then entered her new office and surveyed the space. Alexander had secured her a prime location.

Floor-to-ceiling windows offered an unobstructed panorama of the city skyline.

The view ignited something within Olivia—an unfamiliar sense of agency, as if she was finally steering her own destiny.

Noticing Olivia's reaction, Isabella remarked, "Mr. Hayes personally oversaw every detail of this office. He studied your preferences and ensured everything met your tastes. Olivia, I've never seen him extend this level of consideration to anyone—not even himself."

Olivia smiled warmly and gestured for Isabella to convey her gratitude.

After a pause, Olivia signed that while William had instructed Alexander, his thoughtfulness exceeded mere obligation. She viewed him as family and was deeply moved by his kindness.

"Just as family?" Isabella probed, unable to mask her curiosity.

Olivia nodded firmly, her expression sincere as she continued signing about her profound gratitude toward William and Alexander, despite lacking blood ties.

Isabella nodded thoughtfully, her features softening.

Alexander, who had just reached the office doorway, caught the tail end of their exchange and froze. A flicker of something unreadable crossed his face. His hand hovered momentarily on the door handle before he quietly withdrew.

As Evelyn's birthday approached, Sebastian began bombarding Olivia with messages. His anxiety was palpable—he seemed terrified she might not attend.

Olivia assumed this pressure stemmed from Evelyn's insistence. Liam would undoubtedly support his beloved's wishes, as always.

Olivia reasoned that even if Liam knew Evelyn's invitation wasn't genuine, he wouldn't deny his darling such a trivial request.

Just then, Isabella entered clutching an embossed envelope—an official invitation to Evelyn's birthday gala.

Olivia gestured toward her phone with an ironic smile, signing about the timing of Sebastian's message.

Isabella remarked dryly, "How predictably coordinated."

Realizing her gaffe, Isabella shot Olivia an apologetic look. "Olivia, I didn't mean—"

Olivia shook her head dismissively—Liam was firmly in her past.

Isabella sighed in relief. "If you'd rather not go, just claim urgent work commitments. If Liam causes trouble, Alexander will intervene. Don't worry—he wouldn't dare cross the Whitmores."

Olivia's gaze dropped, her lips curving into a faint, humorless smile. She reminded Isabella of their existing agreement with Liam regarding the client incident. Refusing the invitation would give Liam justification to confront Alexander.

Besides, Olivia reasoned, with so many attendees at Evelyn's party, no one would risk physically assaulting her there.

Isabella frowned. "But—"

Olivia pressed a finger to her lips, signaling silence. She advised Isabella to play ignorant and avoid mentioning it to Alexander, since Liam surely hadn't included him in the invitations.

Olivia added that if things escalated, Isabella could claim she'd been coerced.

Worry creased Isabella's brow. "Are you concerned for my safety? Olivia, it's you I'm worried about!"

Isabella's expression hardened. "If you won't prioritize your own safety, I'll have no choice but to inform Alexander."

With a resigned sigh, Olivia realized she needed to provide a definitive answer. After consideration, she made her decision.

Signing to Isabella, Olivia conveyed that she could accompany her to the event.
###Chapter 173

Olivia gave Isabella a reassuring gesture, indicating she could accompany her to Evelyn's birthday celebration.

Isabella visibly relaxed, nodding eagerly. "Perfect! I'll arrange for a top stylist to prepare your look beforehand. We can't have Evelyn stealing your spotlight at her own party."

A genuine smile curved Olivia's lips as she responded.

Rising from her seat, Olivia embraced Isabella warmly. The comforting hug instantly melted away Isabella's lingering worries.

Though Isabella returned the smile, confusion still flickered in her eyes. How could Liam betray someone as remarkable as Olivia? What spell had Evelyn cast over him? Did elite families truly place such importance on superficial perfection?

Olivia's eyes sparkled as she signed, emphasizing that Isabella and Natalie were her dearest friends.

"Dearest friends?" Isabella repeated, feeling warmth spread to her cheeks.

A pang of guilt struck Isabella as she recalled her initial coldness toward Olivia. She'd been no better than the judgmental outsiders who dismissed Olivia because of her muteness. Yet Olivia had proven herself more capable and courageous than anyone she knew.

Clearing her throat, Isabella quickly changed the subject. "I'll handle all the preparations. Since you're bringing me as your plus-one, you must promise to call me. Don't you dare forget!"

Olivia nodded firmly in agreement.

The day before Evelyn's birthday gala, Olivia returned to the Blackwood estate.

As a servant escorted Olivia through the courtyard, raucous laughter and animated conversation spilled from the grand hall.

Even before entering, Olivia recognized the voices. Margaret and Catherine were present, and surprisingly, Richard too.

Evelyn sat nestled between Margaret and Catherine, playing the delicate ingénue to perfection. Despite years as part of this family, such warm family gatherings remained foreign to Olivia. The three Blackwoods and Evelyn looked like the picture-perfect family.

Had it not been for Liam's insistence, Olivia would have gladly avoided this gathering altogether.

When Olivia entered, the cheerful atmosphere evaporated instantly.

Margaret stiffened, her expression turning glacial. She scrutinized Olivia with disdain. "What brings you here? Surely you're not expecting a welcome?"

Catherine dramatically pinched her nose. "Goodness, the stench of desperation is overwhelming. Couldn't cut it on your own, so you came crawling back? Liam already has someone far more suitable now. Know your place."

Olivia met their hostile gazes with icy composure, refusing to justify her presence.

Evelyn rose with a smirk, announcing loudly, "Don't be cruel! We have more than enough to share with Olivia. Given her... special circumstances, I'd never dream of mistreating her. Wouldn't want people accusing me of bullying the disabled."

Cruel laughter filled the room. Olivia remained unshaken, though her fists clenched tighter. She retrieved her phone and typed: "If my presence bothers you so much, take it up with Liam. One word from him, and I'll leave immediately."

Evelyn's smirk faltered. "Liam only keeps you around out of pity. You're exploiting his kindness."

Olivia arched a challenging brow and typed: "The world's full of pitiable souls. Why should his compassion be reserved for me alone?"

Evelyn's composure shattered. Her hand flew up, poised to strike.

Just before contact, Liam's voice cut through the tension. "What's all this about?"

Evelyn's demeanor transformed instantly. Tears welled in her eyes as she rushed to Liam. "Your family came for a lovely reunion, but Olivia showed up uninvited, provoking me! She said I don't belong here and should leave."

"Is that so?" Liam's piercing gaze shifted to Olivia.

Olivia averted her eyes, her expression carefully blank as she stared into the distance.

A pang of sorrow struck Liam. This was how she always was with him - more distant than even during her arguments with Evelyn.

Catching himself staring too long, Liam looked away.

Unaware of the undercurrents, Evelyn clung to Liam's arm. "You can't possibly take her side! Your mother and sister-in-law witnessed everything!"

Only then did Liam glance at the others lounging on the sofa. A cold smile touched his lips. "Ah, so they're here too?"

Catherine and Richard avoided his gaze. Richard cleared his throat awkwardly. "This is your family matter, Liam. We won't interfere."

Margaret's face hardened. "You should have sent Olivia packing when the divorce was finalized. Bringing outsiders into our home brings bad luck. Since when did you become so soft-hearted?"

Ignoring Margaret's barbed comments, Liam turned to Evelyn with a smile that didn't reach his eyes. "If Olivia troubles you so, the solution is simple. Sebastian, confine her. Ensure she doesn't leave the estate for several days."

Evelyn's eyes widened in alarm. "But she's supposed to attend my birthday party!"

Liam shrugged indifferently. "Birthdays should be joyous occasions. Why invite someone who upsets you? I have prior commitments and won't be hosting anyone."

With that, Liam turned on his heel and left.

Sebastian motioned for Olivia to follow him. Though confused, Olivia complied. Something about the situation felt... off.

Now only the three Blackwoods and Evelyn remained in the hall.

Margaret hurled her glass to the floor in fury. "Did you see how he looked at me? As if I'm his enemy rather than his mother!"

Richard offered hollow comfort. "Mother, you know how Liam can be. He'll come around."

Catherine nodded. "He's upset with me. I'll apologize later."

This only fueled Margaret's rage. "You're his sister-in-law! Why should you apologize to him? Does he expect Richard to grovel too?"

Evelyn seized the opportunity to intervene. Approaching Margaret, she soothed, "Don't be angry. Liam wasn't always like this. When we were together, he often praised you, promising to care for you in your golden years. I suspect Olivia's been poisoning his mind against you."
###Chapter 174

Margaret Winslow kept her tone measured, though her eyes remained icy. "But now Liam's relationship with Olivia is strained, and he still treats me poorly."

Evelyn Hartley was quick to shift blame. "Such deep-seated resentment doesn't disappear overnight. But don't worry. Liam and I have grown close recently. He values my opinion. I'll speak with him, and he'll apologize to you."

As Evelyn spoke, Margaret's expression softened. She grasped Evelyn's hand, her smile radiating satisfaction. "You know, I've always considered you the ideal daughter-in-law. Not only are you stunning, but you're also brilliant—far superior to that mute woman."

A delicate blush colored Evelyn's cheeks. "Liam and I aren't even engaged yet."

Margaret waved dismissively. "I can't fathom what tricks that silent woman has used to prevent Liam from divorcing her. But ultimately, I'm his mother, and I'll resolve this. Evelyn, stay close to Liam. Once I handle this matter, I'm planning your wedding for next month."

Evelyn's face lit up with joy, her hand flying to cover her gasp. "That's wonderful, Margaret! Thank you!"

Margaret chuckled softly. "No need for formalities—we'll be family soon."

Nearby, Catherine Winslow burned with jealousy as she witnessed their intimate exchange.

Richard Winslow's expression darkened abruptly before he stood up violently.

His sudden movement startled Catherine.

Fortunately, Margaret hadn't noticed Richard. Catherine hurried after him.

"What are you doing? Trying to humiliate us?" Catherine hissed in displeasure.

Richard was seething. "Still worried about your pathetic reputation? You've been scheming to pair Evelyn with Liam, haven't you?"

Catherine looked genuinely confused. "What if I have? Removing Olivia benefits us. Don't forget, before Henry passed, he left substantial assets to Olivia. Though your mother seized some, others remain with her. Once she's gone, those assets rightfully return to the Blackwood family—to us."

Richard's fury intensified. He paced like a caged animal, his agitation palpable, leaving Catherine speechless.

Finally, Richard stopped directly before Catherine, jabbing a finger at her face. "Can't you see beyond your petty concerns? Henry always favored Liam. But he knew leaving everything to Liam would cause chaos. So he set one condition—the heir to the Blackwood fortune would be whoever gives him his first grandson."

"Previously, Liam and Olivia's relationship was unstable. After forcing Olivia to abort, my mother claimed she couldn't conceive again. Though you've been useless and only produced a daughter, it bought me time to strategize. But now you rush to divorce Liam from Olivia and push him toward Evelyn? They're both young and healthy—what happens when they start having children? You idiot!"

Richard's shouts echoed in Catherine's skull, making her dizzy. Her knees gave way, nearly collapsing.

Richard looked at her with utter contempt. "Don't you dare touch my mistress, especially now that she's carrying my child. You've been nothing but dead weight, always creating problems. Push me too far, and I'll replace you."

With that final threat, Richard stormed away, his rage trailing behind him.

Catherine crumpled to the floor, tears streaming. She wondered if this was some cruel cosmic joke.

So this rule had existed all along. Yet Catherine had remained oblivious for years. Clearly, Richard and Margaret had been planning this backup strategy since learning of her infertility after their daughter's birth.

Richard had likely been cheating for years.

This realization hardened Catherine's resolve. Olivia and Liam could never reconcile. Unknown to Richard, Olivia was pregnant. And if it was a boy...

Catherine shuddered, refusing to complete the thought.

After finding herself locked in the room, Olivia video-called Isabella Rossi.

Isabella was livid. "Liam's lost his mind! He can't distinguish truth from lies anymore. He actually believes Evelyn's ridiculous claim that you attacked her. Can you believe it?"

Olivia remained composed, gesturing that the truth no longer mattered.

Isabella grew more concerned. "Is he planning to keep you imprisoned there? Should I call the police?"

Olivia gave a soft laugh, reminding Isabella of Evelyn's insistence on her presence at the birthday party. If Olivia didn't appear, Evelyn would have no one to torment.

Olivia reassured her that even if Liam didn't release her, Evelyn's anxiety would likely force her to ensure Olivia attended the party.

Olivia was absolutely right.

At that moment, Evelyn stood outside Liam's study holding a soup tray. She whispered, "Liam, still working? May I come in?"

Silence.

Evelyn's tone turned pleading. "I just need to discuss a few things, then I'll leave. Unless...you think I talk too much?"

Finally, the door opened. Liam appeared in a crisp shirt and relaxed trousers—simple yet radiating aristocratic elegance.

His glacial gaze briefly met Evelyn's, sending shivers down her spine.

"Liam..." A blush colored Evelyn's cheeks. "I'm worried you're overworking. Besides, tomorrow's my birthday party. I wanted to talk."

Liam stepped aside to let her enter.

Once inside, Evelyn set down the tray and immediately threw herself against Liam, clinging to his lean waist, inhaling his distinctive scent. Her heart raced—he felt like hers.

Unseen by her, profound disgust flickered across Liam's face.

Liam subtly retreated, avoiding contact.

Evelyn noticed his withdrawal, studying him with wounded eyes. "Liam, are you upset with me? Why won't you hold me?"

A cold smile touched Liam's lips. "Just exhausted lately. Not in the mood."

He calmly extricated himself from her grasp.

Undeterred, Evelyn hesitated before saying, "There's something I wanted to ask. Despite Olivia's behavior today...I feel sorry for her. Would you mind if I invited her to my party tomorrow?"

Liam settled into his chair, eyes fixed on his computer screen, voice detached. "Why invite her? To ruin your celebration? If you don't want to see her, ignore her. Don't worry about her causing scenes—I'll have her monitored."

Evelyn's smile widened as she draped her arms around his neck. "You always take such good care of me, anticipating everything."

Liam responded with a soft chuckle.
###Chapter 175

Liam kept his gaze lowered, concealing the flicker of irritation and disdain in his eyes from Evelyn.

"Why invite Olivia to your birthday if you despise her? What's the real game here? Planning to use the party as an excuse to torment her?" Liam's voice was sharp as his piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn.

Trapped in his icy stare, Evelyn felt a chill run down her spine. After a moment, she regained her composure. Pouting dramatically, she said, "Don't look at me like that! Do you really think so little of me?"

Liam chuckled, the frost in his eyes vanishing as if it had never existed. The sudden change made Evelyn wonder if she'd imagined his coldness.

"You're overthinking it," Liam said smoothly. "But if you're planning to make Olivia's life difficult, perhaps I should help clean up the mess. With the Hayes family backing her now, I'd hate to see you get burned."

Evelyn's eyelashes fluttered, visibly touched by his apparent concern. "Liam, I can't believe you'd actually protect me like this."

"So you still won't tell me the whole truth?" Liam arched an eyebrow, his tone deceptively light.

Evelyn nibbled her lip, emotions warring across her face. Finally, she sighed. "Honestly, there's no scheme. I'll be too busy hosting tomorrow to bother with petty games. I just thought... since you two had history, it's better to end things amicably. Once she moves on, she won't disrupt your life anymore. That's all."

Liam simply nodded. "Sebastian will handle it. She'll be at your party tomorrow, right on schedule. Don't worry."

Evelyn's face lit up with delight. She leaned in abruptly, attempting to kiss Liam's cheek.

Just as Liam moved to push her away, Sebastian entered the study, pretending not to notice Evelyn's advance. "Mr. Blackwood, your video conference is scheduled. Shall I prepare the connection?"

"Proceed," Liam said with a dismissive wave.

Frustrated by the interruption, Evelyn stormed out in a huff.

Liam exchanged a knowing glance with Sebastian, who followed Evelyn with a resigned expression.

Sebastian caught up to her in the hallway, his polite smile perfectly crafted. "My apologies for earlier. I didn't realize you were in Mr. Blackwood's private study. You must know - he's extremely particular about keeping his personal and professional spaces separate. It's quite an honor. No one else has ever been granted such access."

Evelyn slowed her angry stride, her expression softening slightly. "Is that so?"

"Indeed," Sebastian continued smoothly. "And there's more. You left so abruptly, you might have missed Mr. Blackwood's invitation. He mentioned wanting to meet you tonight in the rose garden. He seemed quite nostalgic, remembering how you used to spend time there together. He was hoping you'd come."

Evelyn's entire demeanor transformed, her eyes lighting up. "He actually said that?"

Sebastian nodded earnestly. "Word for word. I'm off duty now. Perhaps you should prepare for the evening?"

Evelyn practically glowed with excitement as she rushed to her room.

Despite their long acquaintance, Liam and Evelyn had never actually dated. During their school years, Evelyn had constantly sought Liam's attention, leveraging her family's status. The rose garden had been a popular spot for couples, though Liam had always rejected her invitations.

Now, out of nowhere, he'd asked to meet her there. The thought made Evelyn's heart race as she selected a daring crimson dress that accentuated her curves. She hurried to prepare the garden, ordering servants to bring the finest wine and then leave them undisturbed.

Unbeknownst to Evelyn, Liam had no intention of meeting her.

Twenty minutes after her departure, his persistent headache returned. A message from Sebastian confirmed Evelyn had been successfully lured to the garden. Making her wait was punishment for her recent defiance.

Though Evelyn wasn't directly responsible for his pain, Liam suspected she was planning something significant for tomorrow. The uncertainty only fueled his frustration. The more he dwelled on it, the more irritated he became. Why was he still preoccupied with someone who treated him with such indifference?

In a fit of annoyance, Liam turned to his liquor cabinet, downing several glasses. The alcohol burned his throat but provided only temporary relief.

As he drank, Liam realized Sebastian had been right - he was essentially poisoning himself for brief respite. Surrounded by enemies waiting to exploit any weakness, he felt compelled to continue.

Before he knew it, Liam had drunk too much. His eyelids grew heavy, but sleep eluded him as one persistent image haunted his mind.

Meanwhile, Sebastian had discreetly arranged for Olivia's door to be left unlocked.

Unaware, Olivia went about her evening routine, bathing before bed. She paused to text Isabella, confirming their meeting time for tomorrow.

Just as she sent the message, the door creaked open. Wrapped only in a towel, Olivia froze at the ominous sound.

She whirled around, grabbing a vase as she switched off the lights. Moving silently toward the noise, her heart pounded.

When a shadowy figure appeared, Olivia raised the vase to strike - but the intruder was faster, catching her wrist in an iron grip.

The sharp scent of alcohol assaulted her senses. Then a familiar voice murmured mockingly in her ear: "You look ready to commit murder."

Olivia's eyes narrowed in recognition. "Liam? What are you doing here at this hour?"

She struggled against his hold, but Liam easily wrested the vase away and pinned her other hand. Trapped and unable to sign, Olivia trembled with fury.

Flipping the lights on, Liam smirked at the fire in her eyes. "Too late to be afraid now," he taunted.

Olivia turned her face away defiantly.

Undeterred, Liam leaned closer, inhaling her natural scent - not masked by perfumes, but something uniquely her. Strangely, it soothed his pounding headache.

Seizing the moment when Liam seemed distracted, Olivia tried to push him away. But even drunk, his solid frame barely budged.
###Chapter 176

Olivia strained against Liam's weight, but he remained immovable. Oddly, she sensed he wasn't pressing down with his full strength—though pinned, she felt no discomfort. The realization struck her like lightning: he was doing this on purpose.

Fury ignited within her. Olivia sank her teeth into Liam's shoulder. He grunted, the pain seeming to sober him from his drunken haze. His dark eyes narrowed dangerously as he reacted to her bite. Seizing the moment, Olivia frantically signed with her free hands—I'm not Evelyn! You're making a mistake!

Liam didn't even blink. He caught her chin firmly, his voice a low growl. "I know exactly who you are."

Olivia's lashes fluttered, confusion and fear swirling in her widened eyes. Before she could protest, Liam closed the distance between them, silencing her with a searing kiss.

Her entire body trembled under his touch. His intoxicating scent enveloped her, overwhelming her senses. Against her will, Olivia found herself melting into the kiss, powerless against the raw intensity of his passion.

She tried to resist, but Liam was faster—capturing her wrists and pinning them behind her back. As the kiss deepened, his arm snaked around her waist, crushing her against him until not an inch of space remained between them.

His darkened gaze held a storm of emotions—desire, restraint, something unreadable. Though clearly tempted to abandon all control, he held back, teasing her lips with alternating gentleness and demanding pressure.

Time stretched endlessly in that embrace. When Liam finally pulled away, gasping, Olivia could barely think straight.

Dazed, she glanced around—somehow, they'd ended up on the bed. The intimacy of the moment felt surreal, like a fragment of a forgotten dream.

Olivia's mind reeled. She'd convinced herself her feelings for Liam were dead. Yet her traitorous body had responded instantly—weak limbs, racing heart. Was this just muscle memory from their past?

Before she could recover, Liam dragged her back into his arms, inhaling deeply. Outside, rain began pattering against the windows, a quiet backdrop to the charged silence.

To Liam, this moment felt suspended in time. Olivia lay stiff beside him until a memory jolted her. She tried to rise, but his arm tightened around her. "What are you afraid of?" he murmured. "That I'll hurt you? Stop fighting it."

Frustration flared in Olivia. Was she just an emotional placeholder for him? Mindful of her pregnancy, she carefully extracted herself from his grip, avoiding any sudden movements.

When she turned back, Liam's face was pale, sweat beading his forehead. Their kiss seemed to have cleared his mind—but now, pain contorted his features.

This was new. Olivia had never seen Liam visibly suffering before. Years ago, when a stomach ulcer had hospitalized him, he'd sat stiffly on the hospital bed, scowling when she arrived. "Why are you here? It's not like I'm dying."

She'd brought homemade soup, signing that Sebastian had informed her. For a fleeting second, his expression had softened—before icing over again. "It's pouring outside. Think before you act. Don't misunderstand—I don't care about you. But as my wife, showing up like this makes it seem dire."

Back then, raw from losing their first child, his words had cut deep. She'd left with her head high, but the wound never fully healed.

Now, seeing genuine agony twist Liam's face, Olivia hesitated. Sebastian was off-duty, unreachable.

Liam groaned, curling into himself. Olivia sighed—her compassion was her weakness. Despite everything, she approached him, shaking his shoulder gently.

Sweat-drenched and pale, Liam barely managed to meet her gaze. Olivia signed carefully: Should I call Evelyn? Or a doctor?

When she gestured that she couldn't physically carry him, Liam exhaled sharply—then yanked her into his arms. Olivia stumbled against his chest as he buried his face in her hair. "Just stay," he muttered. "I feel like hell."

Confused but sensing his tension ease, Olivia remained still. Against her better judgment, she signed a question: What's wrong with you?

Eyes closed, Liam responded with familiar coldness. "Why do you care? Knowing will only burden you."

Olivia frowned. Even in pain, his arrogance surfaced. Yet as rain drummed softly, her eyelids grew heavy. Unintentionally, she drifted into sleep.

Liam's headache finally eased. He glanced down at Olivia, peaceful in his arms—something that hadn't happened since their early marriage days. Back then, she'd been like a skittish rabbit around him.

He couldn't fathom her fear. Perhaps love's absence bred such wariness.

Olivia stirred, weakly pushing at his arm in her sleep. Liam only tightened his hold, unwilling to relinquish this fragile closeness. Eventually, she stilled, sinking deeper into slumber.

For the first time in years, Liam slept soundly, the storm outside fading into white noise.

Meanwhile, in the garden, Evelyn waited through the long, lonely night. The candles she'd lit for a romantic evening guttered out hours ago. Dawn found her waking stiffly at the table, the untouched wine and scattered rose petals mocking her futile hopes.

Liam never came.
###Chapter 177

Olivia glanced down at her arms, wincing at the angry red mosquito bites covering her skin. She'd explicitly ordered the staff not to disturb her last night, yet morning had arrived without the expected visitor. The garden buzzed with servants going about their duties, their sidelong glances filled with poorly concealed pity.

Last evening, Olivia had made unreasonable demands - forcing off-duty staff to stay late preparing what she'd envisioned as a perfect romantic setting. Now, in the harsh morning light, her solitary vigil was obvious to everyone.

Their judgmental stares made her skin prickle. "Stop staring!" Olivia snapped, voice sharp as shattered glass. "Don't you have work to do?" The servants scattered, but their smirks lingered like poison in her veins.

Storming back toward the mansion, Olivia intended to confront Liam for answers. Yet as she neared his quarters, doubt crept in. Maybe he had a valid reason. Finding Sebastian absent from his post only fueled her frustration.

With no outlet, Olivia's rage erupted. She smashed several crystal decanters against the wall. Then inspiration struck - Natalie would make the perfect target for her fury.

Gathering servants like an avenging army, Olivia marched toward Natalie's room.

Natalie awoke to golden sunlight, momentarily disoriented. Then Liam stirred beside her, and last night's memories crashed over her like icy waves. Horror twisted her stomach - how had she fallen asleep so vulnerably next to him?

She tried rising, but Liam's arm pinned her down. As she debated how to wake him gently, rapid footsteps approached. The door shuddered under violent knocking.

"Olivia! Open this door immediately!" Evelyn's voice sliced through the wood, sharp with fury.

Natalie jabbed Liam urgently. He blinked sleepily before dismissing the disturbance and drifting off again.

Panic threatened until realization steadied her. Why was she panicking? They were still legally married, if only on paper. This wasn't some illicit affair.

Jaw set, Natalie typed a message and held her phone to Liam's ear. The robotic female voice grated: "Evelyn's here. Handle this or I will. Remember - my door cameras show you came here voluntarily last night."

Liam finally opened his eyes, annoyed. "So?" he drawled. "Why the drama?"

Natalie's expression darkened. "Your problems with her aren't mine. I won't be collateral damage."

Liam lazily texted someone while Natalie gritted her teeth, determined to end this farce.

Just as her hand touched the knob, Evelyn's tone changed abruptly. "Forget it. We're leaving." The footsteps retreated.

Natalie turned to find Liam already dressed, his expression icy. He brushed past her without a glance, last night's intimacy erased.

Alone, Natalie pieced things together. Clearly, Liam had fought with Evelyn and used her room to vent. She resolved to keep her door locked henceforth.

Bound by their arrangement, Natalie knew she'd be staying awhile. Her priorities were clear - protect her unborn child and her peace.

Then she remembered - today was Evelyn's birthday gala, and she'd promised to meet Isabella. Hurrying out, she found Isabella anxiously waiting.

"There you are!" Isabella rushed over, scanning Natalie head-to-toe. "I nearly called the police when you didn't answer!"

Natalie smiled reassuringly, gesturing about an unexpected delay. Together, they headed to the gala venue.

"Natalie!" A familiar voice called.

She turned to see her old friend Natalie Bennett rushing over, face alight. "I just got back from abroad! I've missed you so much!"

Delighted, Natalie asked about Natalie's brother Daniel.

Natalie's smile faltered. "He...got married recently. Quite wrapped up in his new wife."

Natalie blinked, then warmly congratulated him, though she'd send belated wedding gifts.

Natalie muttered, "He wouldn't like hearing that." Daniel had married under family pressure - a detail Natalie missed.

Checking her watch, Natalie linked arms with Natalie, heading inside.

"Olivia!" Daniel's voice stopped them. Arm-in-arm with his elegant but sharp-eyed wife, his greeting held complex emotions. "Long time."

Natalie typed quickly, showing her phone: "Wonderful to see you! Congratulations on your marriage!"
###Chapter 178

Daniel froze momentarily, but the woman beside him merely arched a perfectly sculpted brow. "How unexpectedly charitable of you. The rumors painting you as heartless seem quite unfounded, don't they?"

Though her words sounded like praise, Olivia detected an undercurrent of venom beneath the saccharine tone. The woman's gaze held a glacial sharpness that made Olivia's skin prickle with unease.

Until this moment, Olivia hadn't even known Daniel was married. She'd deliberately maintained distance, yet now found herself entangled in this uncomfortable dynamic. Natalie swiftly intervened, positioning herself as a buffer with practiced grace. "Daniel, why don't you give your wife the grand tour? We'll be heading inside."

Daniel's eyes lingered on Olivia with unspoken regret. "Of course. See you inside."

As the group dispersed, Victoria Ellington dropped her polished facade. Her porcelain features twisted into something ugly. "So she's the one who haunts your thoughts? What could possibly be so remarkable about a mute woman? How am I not enough?" Each word dripped with escalating bitterness.

Daniel's jaw tightened. "That chapter is closed. You saw for yourself—nothing inappropriate occurred."

Victoria's manicured nails dug into her palms. "Only because I was present, and your sister had already announced our marriage before my arrival. Don't be fooled—that woman is far more calculating than she appears. Given the chance, she'd—"

"Enough!" Daniel's voice cracked like thunder, his composure shattering. "Olivia has done nothing wrong. Must you vilify her at every turn?"

Victoria recoiled as if struck, her eyes shimmering with wounded pride. "There you go again—leaping to her defense without hesitation. I'm your wife. Your loyalty belongs to me, not some pathetic mute!" Her voice broke as tears spilled over, each droplet a calculated performance.

Daniel exhaled sharply, confronting the brutal truth—he felt nothing for Victoria. Their union had been born from deception; a drug-induced haze leading to irreversible vows. Though resolved to honor his commitment, he couldn't fabricate affection.

Victoria's tears dried abruptly, replaced by cold determination. "Silent treatment? Fine. Let's see how long you stay quiet when I make Olivia's life a living hell."

She spun on her stiletto heels, the sharp clicks echoing her fury. Daniel reached out but grasped only air.

Fumbling for his phone, Daniel dialed Natalie. She answered instantly, irritation lacing her tone. "Daniel, I understand this marriage isn't what you wanted, but it's done. You need to stay away from Olivia—completely."

A humorless laugh escaped him. "Do you truly believe that's possible?"

Natalie hesitated. The impossibility hung between them, yet no alternatives presented themselves.

"I'll keep Olivia occupied on the opposite side of the venue," Natalie conceded. "But you need to resolve this. This limbo helps no one."

Daniel massaged his temples. "I know. I've made my decision—I'll let go. If Victoria can find contentment, I'll dedicate myself to being the husband she deserves."

Natalie's relieved sigh carried through the receiver.

Unbeknownst to them, Olivia had overheard the entire exchange. A frown creased her brow as realization dawned—she'd unwittingly become a wedge in this marriage. Avoidance wasn't a solution; perhaps a direct conversation with Victoria was necessary.

The absurdity struck her. She was married herself, albeit to a crumbling union with Liam. Pregnant with his child, she had zero interest in romantic entanglements. How had she become perceived as a threat?

Raucous laughter erupted from an adjacent room, shattering her thoughts.

"Seriously? They invited a deaf musician? What's next—circus freaks?"

"Give him credit—he's talented despite the disability."

"Why would Evelyn invite geriatric performers? Oh wait..." A dramatic pause. "To pair the deaf with the mute! Poetic, isn't it?"

Isabella had heard enough. She surged forward, but Olivia caught her wrist.

The space served as a green room for the evening's performers. A clique of trust-fund brats lounged like pampered cats, their cruelty unchecked. Though renowned artists mingled nearby, none dared challenge these spoiled elites.

When Olivia's group entered, the laughter died abruptly. Natalie, known for her fiery temper, stepped forward. "Care to share the joke? We'd all love to laugh."

Most shrank under her glare, but one brazen socialite smirked. "Just admiring how the mighty Bennett heir has become a mute's lapdog. What's wrong—can't take a joke about precious Olivia?"

Natalie's hands balled into fists, but Olivia restrained her with a calming touch, signaling that reacting would play into Evelyn's hands.

The provocateur sneered. "What's the matter? Can't defend yourself without your rich friends? At least we can speak—how are we inferior to a defective creature like you?"

Isabella's voice turned arctic. "Olivia was raised by the Winslows, yes—and she doesn't speak. But she's also Gregory Thornton's protégé and Whitmore Holdings' lead consultant. Every achievement is earned. Whereas you..." Her gaze swept over them disdainfully. "What have you accomplished beyond squandering family fortunes in Montecarlo casinos?"

Natalie's sudden laughter was razor-sharp. "Oh darling, you flatter them. These parasites couldn't earn a penny if their lives depended on it."

The tension crackled like live wire, the air thick with unspoken challenges.
###Chapter 179

Natalie scoffed, rolling her eyes dramatically. "Honestly? If these brats were mine, I'd trade them for a goldfish in a heartbeat."

Her sharp words hung in the air like daggers, silencing the rude onlookers. Their faces burned crimson with humiliation, but the crowded venue kept their tempers in check. With venomous glares thrown at our trio, they stormed off in a huff.

Olivia turned to us, her expressive eyes shimmering with both gratitude and worry. She motioned hastily, insisting we shouldn't have provoked them for her sake.

Natalie crossed her arms, her brows knitting together. "Stop that right now. If you keep talking like we're strangers, I swear I'll scream."

Isabella nodded vigorously in agreement.

The sudden silence made us turn. The elderly pianist was rising unsteadily from his bench. Olivia's breath caught when she noticed his hearing aid - meaning he'd heard every cruel whisper, yet played flawlessly without missing a single note.

A cold realization washed over Olivia. Evelyn's plan became painfully clear - she'd hired this man specifically to humiliate Olivia. Worse, Evelyn would likely punish him afterward. Guilt gnawing at her, Olivia approached the pianist and gently tapped his shoulder.

When he turned, Olivia's radiant smile greeted him. Her eyes sparkled like constellations, warm and inviting. Using graceful hand movements, she praised his magnificent performance.

To her astonishment, the man responded fluently in sign language. When Olivia indicated her voicelessness by touching her throat, he simply smiled and signed that limitations meant nothing. He was certain her spirit would sing beautifully if given the chance.

Something deep within Olivia trembled at his words.

His gentle smile held such kindness that Olivia's guilt intensified. She'd meant to comfort him, yet found herself comforted instead.

Determined to protect him from Evelyn's wrath, Olivia urgently signed that the host had ulterior motives. She offered to double his payment if he left immediately. But the old man shook his head - money wasn't why he stayed. He was searching for someone.

Confused, Olivia asked if he sought a man or woman, offering her friends' help in the search. She pleaded with him to leave before facing mistreatment.

His resolve remained unshaken. He signed that though he couldn't remember who he sought, he must continue his quest.

Respecting his decision, Olivia stepped back, concern etching her features.

Suddenly, Natalie appeared, gripping Olivia's arm urgently. "Olivia! Come quick - it's important."

Nodding, Olivia signed a quick farewell to the pianist. As she walked away, the old man stared after her, overcome with inexplicable familiarity. Could she be the one? His memory failed him - who was he searching for?

His thoughts tangled like knotted strings. The face in his mind blurred and shifted. The harder he grasped at the memory, the more it slipped away. Clutching his temples, he slumped into a corner, muttering incoherently.

A group of servers approached moments later. One shoved him roughly. "Get up, old man. The mistress wants you playing, not lazing about."

"Don't bother - he's deaf as a post," another sneered.

"Oh right," the first laughed cruelly.

Their mocking laughter shattered the air. The old man's eyes flew open, his entire demeanor transforming as he stood abruptly. "What did you call me?" His voice boomed with unexpected authority.

The servers recoiled, stunned by both his hearing and commanding presence. Only when he strode away did they regain their voices.

"He could hear us this whole time?"

"Did you see those hearing aids? That cunning old-"

"Enough. Did you feel that? He's no ordinary man."

"Don't be ridiculous. Miss Hartley picked him up off some foreign street corner."

"Yeah, just some wandering musician she took pity on."

"Whatever. Not our problem."

They scattered quickly, eager to forget the unsettling encounter.

Meanwhile, Natalie pulled Olivia through the glittering crowd. Olivia's unease grew with each step, matching Natalie's grim expression. Just as Olivia began to sign a question, Natalie stopped abruptly and pointed.

Olivia followed her gaze - and froze. There stood Evelyn, chatting animatedly with none other than Victoria Ellington, Daniel's wife.

Olivia knew Victoria despised her, but seeing her with Evelyn was unexpected.

Natalie exhaled sharply. "They just met tonight. I never wanted you dragged into my brother's marital drama, but here we are." She bit her lip. "Victoria comes from serious political power. She's obsessed with Daniel and not someone to cross. The last thing I want is you two as enemies."

Natalie's hands trembled slightly as she continued. "Seeing her with Evelyn... it terrifies me."

Her worried gaze locked onto Olivia.

A heavy weight settled in Olivia's chest. She'd unwittingly made a formidable enemy.

Quickly, Olivia signed reassurance. "Don't worry. If I stay out of her way, even her influence can't touch me."

She paused, then added that she'd find a way to speak with Victoria - explaining that causing conflict would only push Daniel further away if Victoria truly wanted their marriage to work.

Natalie sighed in frustration. "This is all Daniel's fault. He never should've brought Victoria tonight."

Olivia shook her head with a knowing smile, signing that Daniel was thoughtful - he must have his reasons, likely knowing Victoria wouldn't be easily manipulated.

Natalie blinked in surprise. "You've never even met her. How can you be so sure?"

Olivia merely smiled enigmatically, her eyes twinkling with secret understanding.
###Chapter 180

Victoria Ellington elegantly handed a cocktail to Evelyn Hartley, her smile laced with subtle admiration. "I've heard countless stories about you. Seeing you in person today, it's obvious you're in a league of your own."

Evelyn returned the smile, warmth and distance perfectly balanced. "We're all human, just packaged differently. What makes me so special?"

"Oh, but you are," Victoria insisted, leaning in conspiratorially. "You carry yourself with a magnetism most people spend lifetimes chasing but never quite grasp."

"You know Olivia Sinclair, don't you?" Victoria continued, her tone shifting. "She plays the fragile, innocent mute, but beneath that facade, she's a master manipulator. Even though she was raised among the Blackwoods, she’s nothing like them. Compared to you? Worlds apart. She doesn’t even come close."

Evelyn’s expression flickered with surprise. "You know Olivia?"

"Of course," Victoria said, patting the seat beside her in invitation.

She launched into a detailed account of Olivia’s supposed schemes, sparing no detail. "I know about her past with your husband. He’s a gentleman, but Olivia exploits her connection to Natalie Bennett to get close to him. And it’s not just him—she’s also entangled with Alexander Hayes. Somehow, she’s wrapped him around her finger too. She juggles men effortlessly. I can’t fathom what spell she’s cast over them."

As Victoria spoke, Evelyn’s face darkened. "I haven’t been in this city long, so I don’t know much about Olivia. I only knew she had ties to my husband’s family. Without your insight, I’d have remained in the dark. I had no idea she was so… skilled."

Noticing Evelyn’s distress, Victoria took her hand sympathetically. "It infuriates me to see someone like you being played. I know you’re not the type to tolerate this. Why don’t we team up against her? I have no ulterior motives—I just want her to learn her place. After tonight’s party, come to my place. We’ll strategize."

Victoria’s eyes gleamed with cunning. She was already envisioning how Evelyn’s influence could crush Olivia once and for all.

"Unfortunately, I have prior engagements tonight," Evelyn replied, her polite refusal catching Victoria off guard.

Victoria pressed on. "No worries. If tonight doesn’t work, we’ll find another time. Let’s exchange contacts."

Evelyn didn’t reach for her phone. Instead, she offered a cool, distant smile and adjusted her hair with effortless grace.

"While I’ve enjoyed our chat, you must understand—I don’t form alliances lightly. Besides, if you’re married into the Hartley family and hoping to use my connection to the Ellingtons for your own ends, you’ve misjudged me." Her tone was firm, leaving no room for argument.

Victoria’s smile tightened, barely masking her frustration. She couldn’t fathom Evelyn’s indifference and seethed at the dismissal. She swore Evelyn would regret this.

"You misunderstand," Victoria pressed, voice sharp. "This isn’t about ingratiating myself with the Ellingtons. We both stand to gain by taking down a mutual enemy. I know Olivia’s weaknesses—ones I can’t exploit alone, but you could. Doesn’t it bother you, knowing your husband might still care for her? Especially after you married Daniel, believing it was love at first sight?"

"Enough!" Evelyn snapped, rising abruptly, eyes blazing. "This conversation is inappropriate. Olivia is your enemy, not mine. I won’t be part of your schemes, Miss Hartley. I have more important matters to attend to. Enjoy the gift I brought."

She turned and strode away, leaving Victoria fuming. A servant quickly intervened, whispering a reminder—too many eyes were watching, and their real target tonight was Julian Hawthorne’s plan against Olivia.

Victoria forced composure, glaring at Evelyn’s retreating figure. "She’ll regret this."

Olivia, observing from a distance, didn’t catch their words, but Evelyn’s icy departure and Victoria’s stormy expression told her enough. She excused herself, feigning a need for air, and hurried after Evelyn.

Catching up wasn’t easy—Olivia couldn’t call out. Instead, she darted ahead, planting herself in Evelyn’s path.

Evelyn’s mood had already soured, and Olivia’s sudden appearance deepened her scowl. "What do you want? I’m busy. If this is about Daniel, save your breath. There’s nothing to discuss. And don’t think I’ll fall for your tricks."

Olivia shook her head, quickly typing on her phone and holding it up: "I need to talk to you about Daniel. Five minutes. Please."

Evelyn crossed her arms, smile razor-sharp. "Make it worth my time. I’m not patient, and I have a temper. Remember—you approached me. If I react poorly, that’s on you."

Olivia nodded, then typed with deliberate calm, laying out the history between her and Daniel without pride or shame. Her honesty caught Evelyn off guard.

Olivia kept typing.

###Chapter 181

Olivia Sinclair had nothing left to hide. Those painful chapters of her past were closed forever. She felt no lingering affection for Daniel and only wished Victoria would learn to trust her own husband. Though Daniel couldn't abandon Victoria immediately, his heart clearly wasn't in their marriage.

Love couldn't be manufactured. Even without Olivia's presence, Daniel's feelings for Victoria might never deepen—he could easily fall for someone else entirely.

Victoria struggled to form a rebuttal. Her lips twisted into a bitter smile as she snapped, "So you're saying my husband still pines for you, and I should just... forgive this betrayal?"

Olivia shook her head, fingers flying across her phone screen. "I'm saying you deserve better than clinging to a loveless marriage. Daniel needs to face this truth—and so do you."

Victoria's eyes narrowed. "Is that all?" she demanded sharply.

Olivia hesitated, then placed a protective hand over her abdomen with a faint smile. Her thumbs moved across the screen again. "Perhaps I've overstepped, but as a pregnant woman, I understand why you'd see me as a threat. If you and Daniel are truly meant to be, I sincerely hope you find happiness together."

Victoria's mouth pressed into a thin line. "Our time's up," she said icily, turning away.

Olivia stepped aside with a nod. Whether her words had any impact remained uncertain, but she'd spoken her truth. The choice to believe her now rested with Victoria.

Outside the hotel, Victoria scanned the bustling street. "He still hasn't come after me?" she muttered to herself.

She'd texted Daniel the moment she decided to leave—half hoping to provoke some reaction, some proof he cared.

Logically, Victoria knew her abrupt departure should have raised questions. The ideal scenario would have involved Daniel rushing out to demand an explanation. Even an argument would have been preferable to this... nothingness.

But Daniel remained utterly indifferent, as though they were mere acquaintances rather than spouses. The sharp sting of rejection caught Victoria off guard despite her bravado. Her fists clenched at her sides.

"Madam," her attendant whispered, "shall I call and say you've taken ill?"

Victoria straightened her shoulders. "Don't bother," she said frostily. "I won't beg for scraps of affection."

The attendant hesitated. "Perhaps an honest conversation—"

"Are you taking her side now?" Victoria cut in with a glare.

"Never!" The attendant shook her head vigorously. "But holding onto past pain only hurts you more."

Victoria exhaled sharply, lips trembling before she regained composure. "She made some fair points, I'll admit. But I've met enough wolves in sheep's clothing to know better than to trust appearances. Have you forgotten the rumors about her? That woman could win an Oscar."

She adjusted her gloves with finality. "Have the car brought around. You stay and watch Daniel. If he so much as glances in Olivia's direction, notify me immediately."

As Olivia made her way back through the lobby, a drunken man staggered into her path. She stumbled, barely catching herself as he crashed to the floor with a groan.

Instinctively, she reached to help him up, typing quickly on her phone: "Are you hurt?"

The middle-aged man squinted up at her. "I was walking just fine until you plowed into me," he slurred. "Now you're playing concerned citizen? Don't make me laugh!"

Olivia's brows drew together. She'd been the one wronged here, yet had extended courtesy. Clearly, it was wasted on this brute.

Turning away, she decided not to engage—until his bellow stopped her cold.

"Don't you walk away from me!"

A woman clutching a toddler came rushing over, positioning herself between them. "Darling, you're drunk," she pleaded, helping him up. "Let's just go home—"

The man backhanded her across the face without hesitation. The child's terrified wail split the air.

Olivia moved before she could think, shielding mother and child. Her fingers flew across her phone: "This is a celebration, not your personal punching bag. Touch her again, and security will remove you."

The drunkard sneered. "Call them then, sweetheart. I'm right here."

As Olivia reached for the emergency alert button, the man knocked her phone to the ground with a vicious swipe.

He advanced on her, reeking of alcohol and malice. Behind her, the cowering woman's terrified expression spoke volumes about the abuse she endured.

Olivia stood her ground, chin lifted defiantly.

"Playing hero?" The man's grin turned feral. "Let's see how brave you are when—"

A boot connected with his spine, sending him sprawling.

Liam Blackwood stepped forward without breaking stride, delivering a brutal right hook to the man's jaw. "You picked the wrong place to start trouble," he said, voice like winter frost.

The drunkard's bravado evaporated instantly. He cowered on the ground, clutching his bleeding mouth.

Olivia hadn't expected to see Liam again so soon—not after his abrupt departure earlier. Memories of last night flashed through her mind, making her pulse stutter.

But Liam didn't so much as glance her way, his aloof demeanor cutting deeper than any words. Perhaps last night had been nothing more than alcohol-fueled impulse. His intervention now likely stemmed from protecting Evelyn's event's reputation rather than any concern for her.

The realization settled like lead in her stomach.
###Chapter 182

Olivia knew Liam wouldn't tolerate anyone ruining Evelyn's birthday celebration. The man had clearly picked the worst possible person to provoke.

She turned her attention away from the confrontation, helping the trembling woman and her child stand up.

Then, shockingly, the man tried shifting blame. "Mr. Blackwood, this wasn't my fault. That woman approached me first. I told her to behave with dignity, but she ignored me and caused this scene. She's the problem here."

"Is that so?" Liam's piercing gaze swung toward Olivia.

Olivia didn't even glance his way, remaining focused on the distressed mother and child.

After steadying them, Olivia gave the woman a reassuring smile. Her fingers flew across her phone screen: "Take your child somewhere quiet to rest. We'll handle this."

The woman nodded gratefully but shook her head. "I can't leave. My husband may be flawed, but he's still my husband. Could you please watch my child for ten minutes? Here, take this as thanks." She pressed a jade bracelet into Olivia's hand.

Olivia's eyes widened in refusal, shaking her head vehemently.

"Please, miss. It's nothing valuable. Just promise you'll care for my baby," the woman begged.

Olivia typed rapidly: "I'll gladly watch your child, but I can't accept this. Helping costs me nothing. This gift is too much."

Their polite struggle nearly sent the bracelet tumbling to the floor. To prevent damage, Olivia reluctantly pocketed it, resolving to return it later.

The child's whimpers tugged at Olivia's heart. With her own pregnancy making her more sensitive, she felt overwhelming protectiveness.

She gently stroked the boy's hair, soothing him before leading him toward a private lounge.

Liam's mocking voice followed them. "Playing the saint now? Never took you for the charitable type."

Olivia froze, her expression turning glacial. She pointed out this was Evelyn's event and she was merely cleaning up their mess - they should be thanking her, not mocking.

Liam's laugh was razor-sharp. "Just warning you not to trust so easily." His icy stare at the child made the boy clutch Olivia tighter, sobs escalating.

Olivia shot Liam a venomous glare. How could he intimidate a child? She whisked the boy away without another word.

Liam refocused on the bruised man, his darkening gaze promising further interrogation.

A waiter rushed up. "Mr. Blackwood, Miss Hartley needs you urgently."

With a final glance at the restrained man and weeping woman, Liam ordered his guards, "Watch him," before striding off.

The lounge contained a television and computer. Hoping cartoons would distract the child, Olivia guided him inside.

The boy settled in a corner, his earlier distress replaced by eerie calmness.

Suspecting he worried about his parents, Olivia typed: "Adults can handle their problems. What cartoons do you like?"

Suddenly, the boy spun and flung water in Olivia's face.

Stunned, Olivia leapt up. The child now wore a chilling smile that didn't belong on a child's face.

Her vision blurred. Weakness flooded her limbs. Not low blood sugar - she'd been drugged.

As she staggered toward the door, the world tilted. The last thing she saw was the boy's sinister grin before darkness claimed her.

Meanwhile, Liam found Evelyn waiting impatiently. "You forgot my birthday gift," she pouted.

His lips quirked. "It's special. You'll get it tonight."

"Now," Evelyn insisted. "I want everyone to see how much you cherish me."

"Where then?" Liam indulged.

Evelyn pointed outside. "The garden. Let's gather everyone."

As guests flooded the garden, Liam discreetly texted Sebastian.

Natalie and Isabella noticed Olivia's absence, growing anxious.

Natalie moved to search, but Isabella stopped her. "Announcing Olivia's disappearance plays into Evelyn's hands. Do you really think Liam would side with Olivia?"

Grudgingly, Natalie agreed. "It's sickening watching Evelyn parade around like she owns Liam. Everyone ignores they're still married."

Isabella sighed. "We're powerless now. But Olivia's nearly free. Mr. Montgomery says Liam's been stalling the divorce. We're gathering evidence to force it through."
###Chapter 183

Natalie arched an eyebrow at Isabella. "Alexander went through all that effort for Olivia? Is he in love with her?"

A shadow of uncertainty flickered across Isabella's face, betraying her inner turmoil. "That's between them. I can't say for certain, but Olivia has always seen Alexander as nothing more than a brother."

Natalie nodded in comprehension. "That tracks. Given her current situation, romance is probably the last thing on her mind. At least she has friends like us. Counting on a man for her and Sophie's future would be risky."

The rhythmic thud of helicopter blades suddenly drowned out their conversation.

All eyes turned upward as a chopper descended, unleashing a torrent of flower petals in its wake - a gaudy floral spectacle.

Thud! A festively wrapped gift box attached to a miniature parachute landed perfectly at Evelyn's feet.

Evelyn's cheeks flushed with delight as she cast adoring glances at Liam beside her.

For Evelyn, the extravagant presentation mattered far more than the gift's contents. The grand romantic gesture was everything - especially coming from Liam.

She could already envision tomorrow's society columns buzzing about her magnificent birthday celebration. The entire city would know how deeply Liam adored her.

Natalie, mildly surprised but amused, couldn't resist commenting. "Since when did Liam develop such terrible taste? These petals look cheap and obviously artificial."

Isabella suppressed a chuckle, leaning toward Natalie. "Years ago I attended a golden anniversary where they hired an event company. The decorations looked exactly like this - flashy but painfully tacky."

Natalie caught her meaning immediately. "Oh, you mean-"

Isabella gave a knowing smile but didn't elaborate further.

Their gazes drifted back to Evelyn and Liam.

Evelyn glowed with happiness while Liam wore an expression of utter disinterest.

The irony of the situation wasn't lost on anyone amidst the shower of garish petals.

Natalie smirked. "Evelyn thinks she's won the jackpot, not realizing she's just claimed someone else's discarded prize."

Isabella scanned the crowd, her thoughts turning to Olivia. Olivia had been conspicuously absent earlier, possibly by design, but even now during this spectacle, there was still no sign of her.

Despite the icy relationship between Olivia and Liam, Isabella had noticed moments when Olivia seemed unable to completely detach herself.

Given the circumstances, Olivia's continued absence puzzled Isabella.

A sense of unease settled over her.

Suddenly, loud curses erupted from a nearby room, a woman's shrill voice cutting through the festivities.

Evelyn perked up immediately, deliberately raising her voice. "What's happening over there? Let's investigate!"

Isabella acted swiftly, discreetly pressing a business card into Natalie's hand. "Olivia might be in trouble. Evelyn's people could be watching. This is Alexander's contact. Call him when you get the chance."

Natalie understood immediately, pocketing the card and slipping through the crowd.

Liam's expression darkened as he followed Evelyn toward the commotion.

Inside, the swearing intensified. A woman had apparently caught her husband cheating, discovering him in bed with another woman.

The man desperately defended himself, claiming drunkenness and insisting the woman had taken advantage - a complete misunderstanding.

Evelyn offered a barely concealed smile before stepping forward. "I'm so sorry for this disruption at my party. Let's help this couple resolve their issues privately without spreading rumors."

Her words rang hollow - she might as well have encouraged gossip, given how many guests already had their phones out recording.

As Evelyn reached for the door, Liam caught her wrist. "Leave it. There's nothing worth seeing. It's indecent. Take the guests to the main hall. I'll handle this."

Evelyn frowned. "I don't see the problem. This is my event. If some shameless woman is breaking up a marriage here, it reflects on me." She fluttered her lashes. "I appreciate your concern, Liam, but I can handle it."

Liam's grip remained firm.

Evelyn eyed him suspiciously. "What's really going on? You said today was my day. Unless...do you know who this woman is?"

Liam gave a soft chuckle. "Why would I?"

He finally released her, warning again. "Just be careful."

But his eyes betrayed turbulent emotions.

Evelyn relaxed, grinning mischievously. "I knew it. You can't help worrying about me."

As Evelyn pushed the door open, several bold guests slipped in behind her.

Seizing the moment, Liam quickly texted Sebastian.

The crowd surged into the room, creating chaos.

Olivia's cheeks burned, still feeling the drug's effects. Her limbs felt weak and heavy.

Harsh words buzzed around her, a woman's shrill voice occasionally punctuated by painful pinches and insults.

The pain jolted Olivia awake. She blinked, struggling to comprehend her surroundings.

"My God!" Evelyn's voice rang out as she drew people closer. "Can you believe this? We actually know this woman!"

Olivia lay disheveled on the bed beside a shirtless, equally confused man.

The room descended into pandemonium.

Someone shoved a phone in Olivia's face, snapping pictures.

Slowly, Olivia propped herself up, piecing together the situation.

The man, seeing Olivia awake, seemed to view her as his salvation. He dropped to his knees with a thud. "Miss, please explain to my wife! You said you felt ill from drinking, and I was just helping you rest!"
###Chapter 184

The man sneered, "The moment we stepped inside, you started stripping to seduce me. I'd had a few drinks, sure, but that doesn't excuse your behavior! You need to explain this to my wife!"

The woman spat back venomously. "You might have the face of an angel, but your soul is rotten. Are you that desperate for male attention? Disgusting!"

A mocking laugh erupted from the spectators. "Haven't you heard? This one's getting divorced. Probably can't stand being alone at night."

Olivia ignored the taunts and quickly assessed her situation. Her dress was wrinkled, but her underwear remained undisturbed.

She recalled checking her watch before blacking out. Only seven or eight minutes had passed - not enough time for anything substantial to occur.

Relief washed over her as clarity returned. The hostile stares surrounding her confirmed one thing: this was a setup.

With steady fingers, Olivia typed on her phone: "I don't know you. Someone drugged me. We should call the police to investigate."

Before she could finish, Evelyn's shrill voice cut through the air. "Olivia! Are you seriously accusing me now? After what you pulled at my birthday? I was being gracious inviting you, and this is how you repay me?"

Tears streamed down Evelyn's cheeks as she continued her performance. "You're determined to ruin everything, aren't you?"

In one swift motion, a bystander snatched Olivia's phone and smashed it against the floor. "Think you're clever? No one's buying your innocent act, you little slut!"

The destruction of her phone severed Olivia's last connection to the outside world.

Worse still, nobody in the room understood sign language, leaving her completely isolated.

Evelyn seized the opportunity. "Her silence speaks volumes, doesn't it? Everyone, take a good look at this scheming witch!"

The crowd's murmurs grew louder.

"She's too beautiful to need that ugly man. This doesn't add up."

"Don't be naive. Some women are just born shameless."

"With Liam divorcing her and cutting her off, she's desperate. First Alexander, then Daniel - when they got bored, she had to lower her standards."

"Disgusting. I'm posting her pictures everywhere."

Each cruel word struck Olivia like a physical blow.

The comments grew increasingly vulgar.

"A mute girl must have interesting... techniques. I'd pay to find out."

"Wonder what she charges per night?"

"With these photos, we might not need to pay at all."

Their predatory gazes made Olivia's skin crawl. She tried desperately to communicate through sign language that this was all a setup.

Her efforts only provoked more laughter.

"Look at her flailing hands! Pathetic."

"No wonder Liam wants out. Can't even have a proper argument."

"This is getting entertaining. Let's see how far we can push her."

Evelyn cleared her throat dramatically. "Liam's divorcing her, but she's demanding half his fortune. Everyone knows Olivia was adopted by the Winslows. Without them, she'd be nothing. Yet she repays their kindness with greed."

She paused for effect. "I'm having my lawyers assist Liam. This evidence of infidelity is irrefutable. Support us, and both the Winslow and Hartley families will remember your loyalty."

The mention of favors from powerful families changed the atmosphere instantly. Greed flickered in many eyes.

Noticing the shift, Evelyn smirked. "Help these poor victims get justice. Just don't kill her. I'll handle the fallout."

Something dark awakened in the crowd.

Olivia saw the change in their eyes - the hunger, the cruelty. Her body trembled uncontrollably. She wanted to scream, but her ruined vocal cords betrayed her.

Outside, Isabella fought against three massive bodyguards, tears streaming down her face. The sounds from inside filled her with dread.

"Move!" she screamed, throwing herself at them.

They barely budged. "Save your energy. Miss Hartley's just teaching her a lesson."

Isabella gritted her teeth. "You're breaking the law! The police and the Clarkes are coming. Are you ready to face them?"

The guards exchanged amused glances. "And what will they do? She walked in here willingly. The cameras prove it."

A cold realization struck Isabella. She'd suspected Evelyn's motives but never imagined this level of cruelty. Why go so far when Olivia had already decided to move on from Liam?
###Chapter 185

Isabella was utterly confused. Why would Evelyn resort to such extreme measures? There was clearly a missing piece to this puzzle that she couldn't grasp.

Then it hit her - the small tactical knife concealed in her jacket pocket.

As the security team continued their mocking taunts, a dangerous glint appeared in Isabella's eyes.

Her thoughts raced. If anything happened to Olivia, Alexander would be devastated. He treated Olivia like family and would never forgive himself if she came to harm.

The mere thought of Alexander's heartbreak and Olivia in danger made Isabella's blood boil. She was ready to throw caution to the wind and protect Olivia at all costs.

Just as Isabella made her move, an iron grip seized her shoulder and yanked her backward.

Her fingers barely grazed the knife's handle before she lost balance, the weapon slipping from her grasp.

The assailant moved with military precision, twisting her arm behind her back with such force that Isabella gasped in pain, the knife clattering uselessly to the floor.

Turning her head, she saw Sebastian standing there. Despair crashed over her like a tidal wave, extinguishing her last shred of reason. "Aren't you going to do something? Will you just stand by while they murder Olivia?"

Sebastian smirked dismissively before addressing the guards. "This one's hysterical. I'll handle her. Just secure the entrance."

Fury ignited in Isabella's chest. "Have you no humanity? How can you be so heartless? What has Olivia ever done to you? What crime has she committed?"

She was forcibly dragged into an adjacent room where Liam stood waiting.

The sight of Liam triggered an almost primal urge in Isabella to attack.

But Liam remained facing away, his posture rigid, emotions carefully concealed.

Isabella could feel the emotional chasm between them.

"Liam," she rasped, voice raw with desperation. "I know Olivia must have angered you, but remember your history. She's practically family. Even with the divorce, she grew up in your household. Can you truly watch her suffer like this?"

Silence was Liam's only response, his hand waving her away in dismissal.

Sebastian interjected professionally, "Mr. Blackwood wishes no conflict with the Whitmore family. Pretend you saw nothing, and I'll escort you out safely."

As Sebastian began leading her away, Isabella spotted an unguarded rear exit. Seizing her chance, she drove her heel into Sebastian's instep with crushing force.

His grip slackened momentarily from the pain - just enough for Isabella to bolt through the doorway.

Sebastian made a half-hearted pursuit before abandoning the chase with an exaggerated sigh.

Approaching Liam again, Sebastian lowered his voice. "She's inside now. The situation looks unusual, but their focus remains on Olivia. Your orders, Mr. Blackwood?"

Liam's fingers turned white-knuckled on the railing. Beneath his controlled exterior, fury raged like a storm - veins pulsing at his temples, eyes burning with barely contained wrath.

When he spoke, his voice vibrated with suppressed violence. "Our next move? I want them erased from existence!"

Sebastian placed a calming hand on Liam's shoulder. "Sir, you must remain composed. Losing control now will only endanger your wife further. The neurotoxin never reached Olivia - I've confirmed this. The Whitmores are nearly here, and with Isabella inside, she'll buy us precious time."

Liam's gaze turned arctic. Without warning, his fist smashed into the railing with bone-crushing force.

The reinforced metal trembled from the impact as blood welled from Liam's split knuckles. He seemed oblivious to the pain, driven only by self-loathing and rage. What good was his power if he couldn't protect the woman he loved?

Sebastian's face twisted in distress. "Mr. Blackwood, please! You'll draw unwanted attention."

Gradually, some semblance of control returned to Liam, though his eyes still promised vengeance. "Mobilize our inside team. If negotiations fail, we extract her immediately. Consequences be damned - I'll ensure her safety abroad even if she hates me forever. The Blackwood debt to her must be honored, as my grandfather decreed."

The words tasted like ashes in Liam's mouth.

With a resigned nod, Sebastian departed to execute their contingency plan.

Meanwhile, Isabella made her dramatic entrance.

Olivia lay immobilized on the table, vulnerable as a beached dolphin awaiting slaughter. Though her clothing remained intact, the hungry looks from her captors promised imminent violation.

Olivia's tear-filled eyes stared blankly at the ceiling, her expression one of shattered resignation.

Evelyn watched with perverse satisfaction, calculating whether the coming violence might conveniently terminate Olivia's pregnancy - absolving her of direct responsibility.

This was poetic justice for anyone foolish enough to covet her man.

Suddenly, Isabella brandished her phone like a weapon. "One move, and this goes live! As Whitmore Holdings' consultant, Olivia has influence. I control her social media with millions of followers. Don't believe me? Ask your precious Miss Hartley!"

All eyes snapped toward Evelyn.

Color drained from Evelyn's face as fury contorted her features.

How had this meddlesome assistant breached their security?

Trapped, Evelyn gave a stiff nod. "It's true," she admitted through clenched teeth. "But let's not forget Olivia's disgraceful behavior. We're merely administering justice. She brought this upon herself."

Isabella's jaw tightened. "Justice is for courts and conscience, not vigilantes. By what authority do you act? I'm broadcasting this atrocity unless you stand down. Try silencing me - the Whitmores value my work. Challenge them if you dare!"

Her fearless defiance rattled the mercenaries. While well-compensated, none sought notoriety. Evelyn's protection suddenly seemed flimsy against Isabella's invocation of legal consequences.
###Chapter 186

Gasps rippled through the crowd as shocked faces turned toward each other.

Evelyn's blood boiled as she whirled on her staff. "How did Isabella get inside? Weren't you supposed to keep watch? Useless fools!"

The servants trembled under her glare. One stammered, "Miss Hartley, she came through the service entrance. We never imagined she'd find it. And we thought Mr. Blackwood had taken her away, so we assumed—"

Evelyn's palm connected sharply with the speaking servant's cheek. "Are you implying Liam deliberately let her in to protect Olivia?"

The servant clutched her stinging face, eyes wide with fear. "No! Mr. Blackwood had nothing to do with this! I spoke out of turn!"

From across the room, Isabella watched Evelyn unravel. A mocking smile curled her lips. "What's wrong? Did you set this whole thing up to destroy Olivia? Scared your plan's falling apart?"

Evelyn's nostrils flared. "Set up? I don't know what you're talking about. Even if we can't touch her, she's still a husband-stealer. The wife is right here—let her deal with this homewrecker."

The mentioned woman straightened, emboldened. "I'm not afraid! Call the police! Broadcast it live! She's the one who should be ashamed, trying to seduce my husband! Let the world see what kind of woman she really is!"

As the woman advanced on Olivia, hurling vulgar insults, Isabella grew increasingly anxious. Where was Alexander? He should have arrived by now.

A child's piercing scream shattered the chaos. All heads turned toward the entrance where an elderly gentleman gripped a young boy's wrist.

The boy thrashed violently, his face twisted in fear and defiance. When escape proved impossible, he erupted into tears and began screaming profanities at his captor.

"Whose child is this? Such foul language at his age!"

"Clearly lacks proper upbringing."

Evelyn paled when she recognized the boy. "Get them out of here!" she barked at her security. "This event is ruined enough without these disruptions!"

The old man's voice rang clear. "I'm exactly where I need to be." The crowd gasped—Evelyn had hired him believing him mute.

Adjusting his hearing aids, he continued, "I witnessed everything. This young woman saved a wife from her abusive husband. The wife then asked her to watch this boy. She brought him here to rest when he spilled water, causing her to faint."

Olivia spotted them through the crowd and urgently signed to Isabella. Realization dawned on Isabella's face. "So Evelyn used a child to frame you?"

Olivia's bitter smile confirmed it. The involvement of a child had lowered her guard completely.

Evelyn scoffed loudly. "You're just a deaf old man! Don't let pity for this mute girl cloud your judgment—we all saw her disgraceful behavior!"

The elder remained unshaken. "My vision is perfect. If you doubt me, ask the boy yourself." He fixed the child with a stern look. "Remember what happens to children who lie? The shadow man comes to take them away at night."

The boy trembled. "She... she just brought me here to rest. Then she fell down."

"Still unconvinced?" The old man challenged. "Call the authorities. Let's see who's truly guilty here—an innocent woman or those coercing a child to lie."

Evelyn's confidence wavered. This homeless man she'd recruited as part of her humiliation plot was now dismantling her scheme with perfect logic.

Her voice turned icy. "Think carefully, old man. I plucked you from the streets. Without me, you'd still be freezing and starving. You know who I am. Do you really want to cross me?"

The elder met her threat calmly. "Miss Hartley, first—you brought me here against my will. Second, while I appreciate the meals, I won't participate in your cruel games. And finally..." He smiled faintly. "What exactly can you do to me? I've survived worse than your empty threats."

"You senile old—" Evelyn began, but a servant urgently pulled her aside. "Miss Hartley, this isn't working. There will be other opportunities. Don't make a scene here."

Evelyn inhaled sharply, forcing a strained smile. "It seems there's been a misunderstanding. My apologies for the confusion." With that, she stormed out, her composure shattering the moment she turned away.

###Chapter 187

The couple exchanged uneasy glances, realizing Evelyn had abandoned them. Under the judgmental gazes of the assembled guests, they had no choice but to slink away in shame.

As Evelyn departed, the crowd inside gradually dispersed, following her like obedient sheep.

Only then did Olivia allow herself to relax. She took a steadying breath and smoothed the wrinkles from her dress.

Approaching the elderly gentleman, Olivia bowed deeply. Her eyes shimmered with gratitude as she silently mouthed her thanks for his timely intervention.

The old man waved dismissively. "Truth needs no thanks. Besides, you once helped me when I was in trouble. This was merely returning the favor."

With a gentle push, he guided the trembling boy toward Olivia.

"Young man, this lady will take care of you now."

The child stood frozen, his small frame shaking, unable to meet Olivia's gaze.

Though the boy had deceived her earlier, Olivia's heart ached at his obvious distress. She knelt to his level, typing rapidly on her phone before letting the mechanical voice speak for her.

"I understand children sometimes make mistakes without realizing the consequences. I won't punish you for this."

The boy peeked through his fingers. "R-really? You won't call the police?"

Olivia shook her head firmly, her expression softening as she studied him closer. The ill-fitting suit hung awkwardly on his thin frame, revealing frayed clothing beneath.

It became clear this wasn't Evelyn's child, but some impoverished boy she'd manipulated into participating in her scheme - likely with promises of food or money.

To a starving child, the line between right and wrong often blurred.

The boy suddenly broke down, fat tears rolling down his cheeks. "I'm sorry! The scary lady said she'd have me arrested if I didn't help. I just wanted some of the leftover food from the party..."

Olivia sighed, torn between frustration and pity. She turned to Isabella, gesturing for help locating the boy's real family.

Isabella frowned. "This child could expose Evelyn's scheme. Are you truly letting this go?"

Olivia shook her head sharply. She had no intention of forgiving Evelyn, but dragging an innocent child into their feud would only bring him harm.

Her expression darkened as she considered Liam's likely reaction. He'd been present during the earlier confrontation. If he saw this boy now, he'd understand everything.

Yet Olivia doubted Liam would side with her. More likely, he'd protect Evelyn's reputation at any cost.

For now, she had to retreat - but silently vowed this debt wouldn't go unpaid.

As Isabella led the boy away, Olivia noticed the elderly gentleman studying her intently, his gaze oddly familiar.

Curious, she gestured if he'd found the person he sought.

The old man sighed. "Her face eludes me, but my heart knows I must find her."

Olivia offered her network's assistance, but he declined politely, insisting this was a personal journey.

After their exchange, the gentleman slipped out quietly through a side exit - unaware of the danger awaiting him.

Evelyn's lackeys materialized from the shadows, surrounding him with malicious grins.

"Old man, you messed with the wrong people," one sneered, cracking his knuckles.

The gentleman stood unflinching. "Stand down," he commanded with surprising authority.

Their laughter died when several imposing bodyguards intervened, swiftly subduing the attackers.

A sleek convoy arrived, its centerpiece a stretched Lincoln. A distinguished man emerged, assisting the elderly gentleman inside with reverence.

The would-be assailants gaped as their prey was whisked away in luxury. Who was this unassuming old man?

One bodyguard pressed his boot against a thug's wrist. "Disrespect your elders again," he hissed, "and you'll regret being born."

Nearby, the tinted window of a Maybach lowered slightly. A bespectacled man observed coldly before ordering, "Drive. This isn't worth our time."

As the car pulled away, his driver ventured carefully, "Sir, your grandfather's condition worsens. Three months chasing him across Eldermere..."

"Are you suggesting family is a waste of time?" came the icy reply.

The driver paled. "N-no, sir! I merely meant...if he truly wishes to find..."

"Let him search," the man interrupted, adjusting his cufflinks. "After all, she's my aunt's daughter. The entire Kensington family awaits her return." His gaze hardened. "Triple grandfather's security. Anyone who threatens him again will wish they'd never been born."

"Yes, Mr. Kensington."

The man absently twisted his signet ring. "That woman who exploited grandfather's condition - Hartley, wasn't it?"

"Evelyn Hartley, sir."

"Investigate thoroughly."

The convoy arrived at the city's most exclusive estate. Alighting, the man muttered, "Grandfather insists on maintaining this relic despite our holdings abroad. Sentimental nonsense about 'roots.'"

Aides murmured sycophantic agreement as he helped the elderly gentleman inside.

"Welcome home, Grandfather," he said softly.

The massive doors swung shut behind them.
###Chapter 188

The elderly gentleman's mind wavered between clarity and disorientation. During one particularly confused moment, he glared at his surroundings with a blend of bewilderment and frustration, his trembling fingers reaching up to remove his hearing devices.

Julian Hawthorne acted quickly, calming the older man with soft reassurances until he settled down.

With Julian's support, the distinguished gentleman stepped out of the car. As he regained his balance, sudden recognition flashed across his weathered face. "I've located your cousin. I saw her," he declared with unexpected certainty.

Julian's eyebrows shot up in surprise, a spark of anticipation lighting his eyes. "Is that so? Where exactly did you spot her?"

The older man's forehead creased as he wrestled with the fading memory. "She was right where you collected me. Now remind me - who was she again? What's her name?"

Concerned about overtaxing his grandfather's fragile state, Julian gently suggested they rest while his own mind raced with possibilities.

Though his grandfather's memory came in fragments, the man never spoke without some grain of truth. This claim likely held significance. But who could this mysterious woman be?

Julian's thoughts immediately flew to Evelyn Hartley, the only person who could have persuaded his stubborn grandfather to travel to Eldermere. Given the old man's iron will, few others could influence him so completely. The pieces fit together disturbingly well.

His decision made, Julian issued crisp orders. "Investigate everything about Evelyn Hartley. Arrange a meeting with her in seventy-two hours."

"Understood, sir."

Despite Evelyn's failed attempt to sabotage Olivia Sinclair earlier, her birthday festivities continued without interruption.

At the lavish party, Evelyn delivered an elaborate apology to Olivia, her face a mask of carefully crafted remorse.

Olivia wasn't deceived. She recognized Evelyn's performance as nothing more than a ploy to keep her from leaving.

Then Evelyn presented a gift from Liam Blackwood - a sapphire pendant.

Though not of the highest quality, its value lay in its origin.

"Olivia, I'm truly delighted you could attend my celebration," Evelyn began, her voice dripping with false contrition. "I never imagined things would unfold this way. I've always prided myself on my strong moral compass, and I initially believed you acted impulsively. Now I see I was mistaken. Please accept this peace offering so we can move forward."

As she spoke, Evelyn's eyes shimmered with manufactured sincerity.

The surrounding guests, aware of the tension between the two women, praised Evelyn for her composure and generosity toward Olivia.

But Olivia saw through the charade. The apology's authenticity mattered little. The real purpose behind offering Liam's gift was provocation.

Malice lurked beneath Evelyn's flawless smile and polished beauty.

Olivia knew accepting this token was impossible.

Forcing a polite smile, Olivia gracefully declined the jewelry.

Evelyn feigned hurt, her expression crumbling. "Why won't you accept it? Are you still angry with me? Today's my special day, and while I don't understand why those people targeted you, Olivia, you must see my perspective. I knew it - you loathe me. Perhaps I deserve that."

Onlookers couldn't resist commenting.

"Let's not exaggerate this, shall we? Must the birthday girl beg for forgiveness?"

"Honestly, if someone caused trouble at my event, I'd have them removed immediately, guilty or not. Why single her out unless there's truth to it? Where there's smoke..."

"She must have some skeletons in her closet, no?"

Isabella Rossi cleared her throat calmly. "Miss Hartley, please understand Olivia recognizes this as a misunderstanding. She bears no ill will. This pendant symbolizes your connection with Mr. Blackwood. Though they remain legally married, Olivia genuinely wishes you both happiness. However, given their unresolved marital status, this places her in an awkward position."

Olivia played along, her voice catching as she typed on her phone: "It's fine. I don't believe Miss Hartley meant any harm. I hope she and Liam find fulfillment together. While certain matters between Mr. Blackwood and I require resolution, Miss Hartley, you needn't worry. I'll expedite the divorce proceedings."

Evelyn's perfect smile nearly faltered.

A quiet giggle rippled through the crowd as Olivia secretly congratulated herself on her acting skills.

The guests began regarding Evelyn differently, their expressions shifting noticeably.

Common assumption held that Liam had been with Evelyn first, marrying Olivia out of duty rather than affection. Yet Liam and Olivia remained wed. Evelyn's behavior prompted reevaluation.

"That seems unnecessarily cruel," a male voice cut through the murmurs.

Julian Hawthorne strode forward, his disapproving gaze fixed on Olivia.

"Miss Hartley has apologized. Will you still hold her accountable?"

Olivia studied Julian, perplexed. They'd never had conflicts before, and he'd always been courteous. What had changed today?

Evelyn voiced Olivia's silent question.

Evelyn aligned herself with Julian, saying, "Mr. Hawthorne, I thought you and Olivia were close. What's caused this sudden change? Did you witness what transpired earlier? It was merely a misunderstanding. Olivia would never steal another's husband."

Julian scoffed. "Misunderstanding or not, I wouldn't put it past her."

Gasps erupted. Someone asked curiously, "Who is this gentleman?"

Evelyn introduced him with a smile. "This is Julian Hawthorne, connected to the Whitmore family. His mother is William's youngest daughter, making him Alexander's cousin. He recently rejoined the family fold. Alexander and Olivia were once quite close. I wonder what caused their rift."

Mention of the Whitmore family sparked knowing glances.

It was common knowledge the Whitmores consistently supported Olivia, with Alexander frequently appearing as her public champion.

For Julian, also a Whitmore, to display such open contempt for Olivia suggested deeper complexities.

The crowd's curiosity intensified, their attention riveted on Julian, eager for revelations.

Evelyn turned to Julian in pretended mediation. "You were once friends. If there's been some misunderstanding, why not discuss it with Olivia? Better to part amicably."

Julian responded sharply, his icy stare fixed on Olivia. "There's nothing left to say."

His hostility toward Olivia appeared profound.

Uninterested in unraveling Julian's bizarre behavior, Olivia offered a dismissive smile. She typed on her phone: "Miss Hartley misunderstands my relationship with Mr. Hawthorne. Though connected to the Whitmore family, I've only encountered Mr. Hawthorne occasionally. We've scarcely spoken. I'm unaware of any offense given, but apologize if so. Pressing matters require my attention elsewhere."

With that, Olivia took Isabella's arm and moved toward the exit.

Evelyn caught Julian's attention with a subtle gesture.

Understanding her cue, Julian raised his voice. "Running away because you fear I'll expose your secrets?"
###Chapter 189

The moment Julian Hawthorne made his declaration, the room erupted into pandemonium.

"What kind of secrets? What's he implying?"

"For heaven's sake, can't he just spit it out already?"

"He's clearly trying to cause a scene. Olivia already said she's not close with Julian."

"Are you blind? Even if they're not close, Olivia has deep connections with the Whitmore family. I've always suspected there's more to her."

Dozens of eyes burned into Olivia Sinclair - some curious, some gossip-hungry, others openly suspicious.

Evelyn Hartley fanned the flames with practiced ease. "What exactly are these secrets you're referring to, Mr. Hawthorne? You should be cautious about making accusations in such a public setting. Rumors spread faster than wildfire."

Isabella Rossi had reached her limit. "Enough with the theatrics! If you're planning to spread slander, consider the consequences. Mr. Whitmore treats Olivia like family."

Her words carried an unmistakable warning.

Julian understood the threat perfectly, but gritting his teeth, he countered, "I'm merely stating facts. Olivia has been involved in countless shady dealings under the Whitmore family's protection. My cousin shields her, completely unaware of her true nature. I wouldn't have believed it myself if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes. It's sickening how someone who appears so refined could be capable of such things."

Isabella rolled her eyes dramatically. "Olivia, let's just go."

But Olivia shook her head. The realization had dawned on her - Evelyn and Julian had set this trap together. Whether she stayed or left, the damage would be done. Better to face the storm now than deal with worse consequences later.

Evelyn pretended to defend Olivia. "Mr. Hawthorne, I understand your frustration, but perhaps this should be handled privately. Causing a scene benefits no one."

Julian brushed off Evelyn's hand with disdain. "Miss Hartley, I appreciate your kindness, but I can't stand by while you're being deceived. Today, the truth must come out."

With an exaggerated sigh, Evelyn motioned for security to remove Julian.

The crowd, hungry for drama, immediately protested.

"Miss Hartley, have you forgotten how Olivia treated you? Why protect her reputation?"

"Let Mr. Hawthorne speak! We'll stand with him for justice!"

"Look how furious he is - he must be telling the truth. Go on, Mr. Hawthorne. With us here, Olivia wouldn't dare harm you!"

"Please, continue."

Seeing events unfold exactly as planned, Evelyn stepped aside with a satisfied smirk. "Very well. Let Mr. Hawthorne and Olivia settle their differences."

Despite Julian's accusations, Olivia remained eerily composed, her expression unreadable, as if nothing could shake her.

Julian flashed Olivia a strange, fleeting smile before raising his voice dramatically. "The real reason Olivia has been so close to our family all these years? She's been trying to seduce my grandfather!"

The room fell deathly silent. Even Olivia's mask slipped momentarily - not from fear, but from white-hot rage.

Her hands clenched into fists. William Hawthorne was Julian's grandfather, and to drag her down, he'd sink this low?

"Oh my God!" Evelyn gasped theatrically, covering her mouth. "That can't be true. Your grandfather is an esteemed elder!"

Julian clutched his chest in mock anguish. "Everyone knows how 'close' Olivia and my grandfather supposedly are. You've all heard how they 'bonded instantly,' how he treats her like family. But they share no blood relation. My grandfather is a disciplined man who doesn't suffer fools - so why would he favor an outsider so much?"

His voice dripped with insinuation as he continued, "My mother accidentally overheard my grandfather discussing with his lawyer about leaving part of his estate to Olivia. Suspicious, I installed hidden cameras in his hospital room. What they captured will shock you."

Julian produced his phone, and the crowd surged forward like vultures.

The video showed a hospital room with an elderly man in bed - his features blurred, but everyone assumed it was William.

Soon, a scantily clad woman entered holding documents. She communicated with the man using hand gestures, apparently convincing him to sign.

The man complied.

Mission accomplished, the woman's face lit up with triumph as she leaned down to kiss the man's neck.

The image of the elderly man entangled with the young woman sent waves of disgust through the room.

When the woman glanced up, the camera captured her face in perfect clarity. That aloof beauty could belong to no one but Olivia.

Watching the footage, Isabella's anger spiked. She immediately noticed the hospital room's layout didn't match William's actual room. Moreover, the "sign language" Olivia supposedly used was complete gibberish.

But the crowd, blind to these details, had already made up their minds.

"Oh my God! She's insane - seducing an old man for money!"

"Who would've guessed? Always so proper and reserved, but really this vile?"

"I've got money too. Why go after some old man? She could've come to me."

"Please. She's targeting the Whitmore fortune, not some nobody like you."

Evelyn gasped dramatically. "This can't be right! I remember Olivia always had a soft spot for elderly gentlemen. She was quite fond of Henry. Didn't she meet William through Henry? There must be some mistake."

Her carefully planted words sprouted fresh suspicions.

"I knew something was off! All those powerful old men fawning over her - there had to be a reason."

"Don't just blame those two. This is all on Olivia. Absolutely shameless!"

"Disgusting! I'm recording this."

###Chapter 190

Olivia stumbled but caught herself by gripping Isabella's arm tightly. The disgust wasn't just on others' faces - she felt it churning in her own stomach too.

Her hands trembled with rage. Julian and Evelyn would stoop this low? Dragging two respected elders through the mud just to frame her? One had passed beyond the veil, the other lay on his deathbed. If William ever heard of this...

White-hot fury obliterated all reason. Olivia lunged forward and delivered a stinging slap across Julian's face. The sharp crack silenced the room. Julian staggered back, clutching his cheek, shock widening his eyes as he stared at the petite woman before him.

Her fingers flew in furious signs. How dare he slander William, who had shown him nothing but kindness? If he had grievances, he should face her directly. Did he truly think Alexander would fall for such transparent tricks? Wasn't he afraid of karma's retribution?

Though Julian couldn't understand sign language, the blazing fury in Olivia's glacial stare needed no translation. Guilt flickered briefly before he squared his shoulders. "See how she reacts when exposed?" he declared loudly. "I came today solely to reveal Olivia's true nature - to warn every man in our family."

"This gold-digger will stop at nothing for wealth and status." Julian's voice cracked with false emotion. "Why would I lie about my own grandfather? The kindest man I've ever known. The truth overwhelmed me - I had to speak out. Even if it means being disowned, I regret nothing!"

His passionate performance worked. Disgusted glances rained down on Olivia like poisoned darts. The crowd edged away as if she carried some contagion.

Upstairs, behind a black Venetian mask, a man observed the unfolding drama. His lips curved in a humorless smile. "When did Evelyn and Julian become such close collaborators? How... enterprising." The smile didn't reach his eyes - those nearby recognized the danger signs.

"Sir," his assistant murmured. "Evelyn's deviating from the plan. Should we intervene?"

"Let the show go on." The masked man drained his wine before smashing the glass. "Evelyn had better hope her gamble pays off... or else."

His threat hung in the air as his gaze tracked Liam pushing through the crowd below.

Sebastian intercepted Liam urgently. "Blackwood, I know you're furious. But this is clearly a trap for both you and Olivia!"

Liam's smirk could have frozen hell over. "They think with Henry gone and William bedridden, they can play these games." His voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "If I let this slide, my grandfather would rise from his grave to haunt me."

Sebastian held his ground against Liam's murderous glare. "Natalie's bringing Alexander now. He'll see through this. If you defend Olivia publicly—"

Liam's fists clenched until his knuckles whitened. He knew Sebastian was right. Their real enemy still lurked in shadows - the Millers were just pawns.

Yet the sensation of serpentine eyes watching from the darkness made his skin crawl. One wrong move could doom them all. But...

Meanwhile, Olivia hammered at her phone keyboard with shaking fingers. Tears blurred her vision as she typed her defense - not for her own sake, but for the two elders she loved as family. For them, she'd gladly lay down her life.

But the crowd showed no interest in truth. Cruel taunts rained down:

"Name your price for tonight, Olivia."

"Stop pretending you've got standards."

"Come on, which old man was better in bed?"

Something inside Olivia snapped. She grabbed a champagne flute from a nearby tower and hurled its contents at the leering man. Liquid splashed across his smug face.

"You bitch!" He wiped his eyes furiously. "Can't handle the truth about your whoring?"

He seized Olivia's wrist, arm raised to strike - when an iron grip intercepted him. "Touch her," Liam's voice dripped ice, "and I'll break every bone in your hand."

The man paled, recognizing Liam. "M-Mr. Blackwood—"

Liam's fist buried itself in the man's gut before he could finish. The would-be attacker folded like cheap furniture, gasping on the floor. All arrogance had fled, replaced by pure terror.

Evelyn's smirk faded as she watched Liam defend Olivia.

Wiping his hands fastidiously, Liam addressed Sebastian without glancing at the groaning man. "Remove this trash. However shameless Olivia may be, what right does this filth have to slander my grandfather?"

"At once, sir." With a gesture, Sebastian summoned security to drag the offender away.

Silence descended. Those who'd been loudest moments ago exchanged nervous glances. They'd forgotten one crucial detail - the "victims" in this scandal were pillars of high society. Boris had only accused Olivia and William explicitly. Any implication about Henry had been their own speculation.

The game had just changed.
###Chapter 191

The Sinclair family valued their reputation above all else.

Most guests assumed Liam maintained his composure only because it was Evelyn's birthday celebration. Their assumptions were quickly confirmed.

"Let me make one thing clear," Liam's voice cut through the murmurs like ice. "I won't tolerate any more slanderous rumors about my grandfather. The next person who spreads such lies will face legal consequences. Test me if you dare. The only reason I'm letting this slide today is out of respect for Evelyn's special day."

Hearing this, Evelyn's expression softened instantly. That Liam still considered her feelings filled her with warmth, making her lips curve into a satisfied smile.

She glided toward Liam, slipping her hand through his arm. "I'm so sorry, darling," she cooed. "I was just so shocked by those vile accusations that I froze instead of defending Henry. We all know he would never do such things. It's Olivia who's behaved disgracefully."

Meanwhile, Olivia remained restrained by Isabella, her tear-streaked face flushed with anger rather than sorrow.

Through her blurred vision, Olivia searched Liam's face desperately. He knew the truth about why William had always been kind to her. She didn't expect him to defend her, but surely he'd speak up for William's honor?

Nathaniel had warned her that William's condition was deteriorating rapidly after regaining consciousness. He could pass away any moment now.

Olivia couldn't bear the thought of William leaving this world under such false accusations. The injustice of it burned through her like acid.

Liam felt the weight of Olivia's gaze like physical blows. Each glance shredded his composure until he had to clench his fists to stop himself from reaching for her. The pain was so intense he could barely breathe.

Evelyn watched Olivia with malicious satisfaction. She willed Liam to deliver the final crushing blow that would break Olivia completely.

"Liam," Evelyn purred, pressing closer. "You've known Olivia since childhood. Surely you can clear up these... misunderstandings?"

The ballroom fell deathly silent. All eyes turned to Liam, including Olivia's.

Olivia clung to one fragile hope. Their childhood friendship had been genuine. Back then, the reserved Liam had always appeared when she needed him most.

She remembered middle school vividly - when her beauty first blossomed but her shyness made her an easy target. The Blackwood name had protected her at first, until everyone realized she was just a foster child.

The school's most notorious bully had set his sights on her. When his fan club cornered Olivia in a remote part of campus, accusing her of seducing him, it was Liam who'd appeared like a dark knight.

"You really think Olivia would ever look twice at someone like you?" Liam had sneered at the bully then. When the boy tried blaming Olivia, Liam had shut him down with, "Why would I believe an outsider over my own family?"

Remembering this, Olivia felt certain Liam would defend her now - if not for her sake, then for William and Henry's honor.

But when Liam's eyes finally met hers, they were utterly devoid of recognition. His voice was colder than she'd ever heard it. "We were never close. I don't know her well, and frankly, I don't care to."

His refusal to deny the accusations was as good as confirmation.

Olivia's ears rang. She must have misheard.

Evelyn's smile widened. "Oh Liam, must you be so harsh?" she teased, her voice dripping with false concern. "Think of the poor girl's feelings."

Isabella, seeing Olivia's devastation, shot Liam a venomous glare. "When the truth comes out, Olivia will never forgive you for this."

Suddenly, Olivia wrenched free from Isabella's grip and seized Liam's wrist.

Evelyn moved to intervene, but Olivia fixed her with such a glacial stare that Evelyn faltered.

"Husband," Olivia rasped, the single word tearing from her damaged vocal cords.

It was a stark reminder to everyone - especially Evelyn - that their marriage still stood. While others might interfere, Evelyn had no right.

Evelyn's lips twisted. "Oh, so the mute finally finds her voice," she sneered.

Isabella caught Evelyn's wrist mid-swing. "This is between husband and wife, Miss Hartley. Know your place. Olivia may be forgiving, but I'm not."

Evelyn yanked her arm free with a glare, though she wasn't overly concerned. Liam's obvious distaste for Olivia suggested he'd be eager to divorce her soon enough.

What Evelyn didn't see was the tortured look Liam gave Olivia when her back was turned - an expression filled with such pain and longing it would have shattered her triumphant smile.

Blinded by her own anguish, Olivia missed Liam's silent agony. She had to know - why was he being so cruel? And why wouldn't he defend William?

With trembling hands, she signed that she understood his hatred for her, but begged him to clear William's name.

Liam's response was brutal. "I've told you - this mess is yours alone. If you didn't want the consequences, you shouldn't have done it."

His words, sharp as daggers, pierced Olivia's heart anew. The tears came faster now, each drop a silent scream against the injustice.
###Chapter 192

Olivia's fingers slipped from Liam's arm as if all energy had drained from her body. Tears cascaded down her cheeks unchecked.

The agony was so intense it left her numb, unable to even register her own sorrow.

Isabella rushed to Olivia's side, her voice a gentle murmur as she leaned close. "Olivia, think of the baby. You must stay calm. Mr. Hayes just texted—he's on his way. He'll handle everything."

Though Isabella spoke softly, Liam, standing mere feet away, caught every word.

The mention of "the baby" and "Mr. Hayes" only deepened Liam's scowl. His patience snapped. "What are security doing? Remove these people. The celebration continues. We won’t let unworthy guests ruin this night."

Olivia flinched at the word unworthy. Her lashes trembled as she fought back fresh tears.

In that moment, the last shred of hope she’d clung to for Liam vanished. She cursed herself for not seeing his true nature sooner. Had his kindness ever been genuine, or merely obligation to a foster sister?

Perhaps if they’d never married, things wouldn’t have spiraled this far. Maybe their paths should never have crossed at all.

A sharp pain pulsed at Olivia’s temples. Moving felt sluggish. She needed to leave.

"Alright," Isabella murmured, offering her arm. She guided Olivia toward the exit.

Evelyn’s lips curled in displeasure. This wasn’t how the night was supposed to end. She’d envisioned Olivia broken, begging. Leaving now? Unacceptable. She still had one last blow to deliver.

"Olivia, running away so soon?" Evelyn’s voice sliced through the murmurs.

Her mocking gaze locked onto Olivia. "Even if I struggle to believe you’d stoop this low, Mr. Hawthorne’s evidence seems damning. Don’t you have anything to say?"

She tilted her head, venom dripping from her words. "Henry did everything for you—called in favors, secured your future. And this is how you repay him?"

Whispers of agreement rippled through the crowd.

"Disgraceful. If Henry were alive, he’d demand justice," someone muttered.

"First the Blackwoods, now the Hayes family. How does she sleep at night?" another sneered.

Olivia met Evelyn’s taunting stare with icy defiance.

Isabella stepped forward, indignant. "You condemn her based on one man’s lies? If you want to attack her, at least be honest about it."

Evelyn’s sneer shifted to Isabella. "How curious—a Whitmore Holdings employee defending her so fiercely. Are you collaborating? Birds of a feather, after all."

Olivia’s restraint shattered. Insulting her was one thing. Targeting her friends? Unforgivable.

She lunged, her palm cracking across Evelyn’s cheek.

Evelyn gasped, clutching her face.

Olivia raised her hand again—but Liam caught her wrist.

Seizing the moment, Evelyn wailed. "Liam! She hit me! You can’t ignore this!"

Liam drew a sharp breath, but Julian cut in eagerly. "As witnesses saw, we’re the victims. Olivia must kneel and apologize. And return the twenty million my grandfather gave her. She’ll sign an IOU tonight—in front of my lawyer."

Olivia froze. The pieces clicked. They’d planned this. Were they truly this desperate for money?

Isabella scoffed. "That money was an advance for her consultancy work with Whitmore Holdings. Why should she return it? Or did you orchestrate this entire farce just to steal it? Even dragging William’s name through the mud?"

Julian paled, stammering.

Evelyn jumped in, voice shrill. "Ridiculous! Julian is William’s heir. Do you think he’d risk his inheritance over twenty million?"

Julian straightened, adopting a haughty tone. "This is about justice for my grandfather. As his blood, I will protect his legacy."

Murmurs of approval followed. To the crowd, his demand seemed lenient. Others might’ve demanded far worse.

As Julian’s guards advanced, Olivia nudged Isabella. "Run. Now."

Isabella shook her head. "I promised Alexander I’d protect you. He’s almost here."

Olivia’s jaw tightened. This wasn’t fear—it was fury at dragging Isabella into danger. She’d underestimated Evelyn and Julian’s ruthlessness. To slander William, his own grandfather? The betrayal was staggering.

Julian waved a dismissive hand. "Take them. This ends now."

The guards moved—

A voice thundered from the entrance.

"Since when do outsiders dictate Hayes family affairs?"

Alexander.

Isabella exhaled in relief.

He strode in with a dozen men, commandeering the room instantly.

Evelyn’s face twisted. She’d stationed guards to intercept him—how had he gotten through?

This wasn’t part of the plan.

Not at all.
###Chapter 193

Olivia Sinclair looked serious. "What's going on outside? Are those people just loitering?"

"Miss Hartley, you had quite the security detail keeping me away earlier." Alexander Hayes' voice dripped with sarcasm. "They looked exhausted, so I let them rest. Considerate of me, don't you think? Or perhaps you're nervous about my presence because of what you did to the Whitmore family?" His expression remained frosty.

Several guests exchanged puzzled glances. Julian Hawthorne, a Whitmore relative, had been allowed entry. Why was Alexander being blocked?

Evelyn Hartley clenched her jaw. "It's my birthday celebration. I decide who gets invited. You and I aren't exactly friends. Instead of interrogating me, why don't you ask Olivia why she brought Isabella here without telling you?"

Alexander's gaze shifted between Olivia and Isabella after Evelyn's sharp retort.

Isabella Rossi felt a twinge of guilt. She hadn't anticipated this situation and had followed Olivia's lead in keeping everything from Alexander.

Alexander's tone softened as he addressed Isabella. "What are you afraid of? I know Olivia asked you to keep this from me. I'm not blaming you."

Olivia, appearing weary, managed a faint smile for Alexander, silently communicating that he shouldn't have come since it only brought him trouble.

Alexander shook his head. "How could I stand by while they slander you?"

A voice from the crowd interjected, "Mr. Hayes, you seem close to Olivia. Are you aware of her questionable activities?"

Before Alexander could respond, another voice cut in, "He's probably clueless. Don't tolerate that behavior!"

"Mr. Hayes, now that you're here, your cousin has video evidence and witnesses. Don't let Olivia keep deceiving you. See her for who she truly is."

"Exactly," another voice chimed in agreement.

Alexander's expression turned icy. He spoke with deliberate intensity, "Though I wasn't present earlier, I know everything that happened. I came specifically to set the record straight. My grandfather has always treated Olivia like family, and she's shown him nothing but respect. There's never been anything inappropriate between them. So tell me, what exactly is your agenda?"

As he spoke, Alexander locked eyes with Julian.

Julian felt the weight of Alexander's stare, a chill running down his spine. But retreat wasn't an option now. Facing near-certain failure, he decided to double down, hoping his gamble might still pay off.

Julian raised his voice with feigned concern. "Alexander, you've always respected our grandfather and been kind to Olivia. Now, with this scandal involving the two people you trust most, I understand you don't want to face it. But can you really ignore the video evidence? How do you explain our grandfather wanting to leave part of his estate to Olivia, who isn't even family? I believe Olivia manipulated our grandfather. He's as much a victim as we are. We need to stand together and hold Olivia accountable!"

Julian spoke with apparent sincerity, portraying himself as genuinely concerned for Alexander and the Whitmore family.

Alexander's smile was cold as he countered, "You're absolutely certain about the nature of my grandfather's relationship with Olivia? Would you be willing to swear to it?"

Julian stood his ground. "I'm completely certain. I witnessed it myself, and the video confirms everything."

Ignoring Julian, Alexander turned and suggested, "Arguing is pointless. Let's ask the person directly. That will reveal the truth."

Julian instantly sneered, "You think Olivia will admit to anything? She'll deny everything to save herself. Asking her is useless."

Alexander gave Julian a peculiar smile. "Who said I intended to ask Olivia?"

Suddenly, realization dawned on Julian, his smirk fading. Yet a flicker of hope remained - William was supposedly too ill to leave his bed. Alexander likely hadn't contacted him.

Julian had briefed his mother Eleanor before executing his plan. If necessary, she could accelerate William's demise. By then, it would be too late for Olivia to clear her name, and Alexander, due to his closeness with Olivia, would also be implicated.

At that moment, backed by the Hartley and Blackwood families along with various Whitmore relatives, Julian felt confident that he and his mother would soon control the entire Whitmore empire.

With these thoughts, Julian's panic subsided, replaced by smug satisfaction. He resented everyone who had ever looked down on him and his mother. Despite Alexander receiving the finest education the Whitmores could provide, what difference did it make now? Alexander would still be crushed beneath his feet.

Julian couldn't accept their differing fates. They were both Whitmores. If Alexander could inherit the family fortune, why couldn't he?

Just then, the crowd parted as someone pushed William Whitmore's wheelchair forward.

Julian's smug expression froze when he saw William entering, looking healthier than expected, his face full of color. The contrast between Julian's forced smile and his widening, shocked eyes created a ridiculous sight.

"No... this can't be!" Julian panicked, fumbling for his phone to call Eleanor.

Alexander seemed to read Julian's thoughts and spoke deliberately, his words like ice water. "Don't bother calling your mother. I reported her for poisoning my grandfather. She's likely at the police station by now. Julian, forget about scheming with Evelyn against us and Olivia. Your mother's the real problem now. You should focus on getting her out of jail."

Evelyn dismissed Alexander's sarcasm. Even she could see things hadn't gone according to plan.

"What's happening?" Evelyn snapped at Julian. "Explain yourself, Julian!"

Julian stared at William's healthy complexion and felt his world collapsing. His legs weakened as he kept muttering, "Impossible... this is impossible..."

The crowd remained confused, exchanging bewildered glances.

Olivia's eyes welled with tears when she saw William sitting there, completely unharmed.

"Hello, Olivia." William smiled warmly and waved.

Olivia rushed over and embraced William tightly. Nothing else mattered as long as he was safe.

William shot Alexander an angry look. "I told you - if anyone troubles her, you'd better show up immediately. Look how upset she's become."

Olivia straightened up and quickly signed that she was fine.
###Chapter 194

Alexander spoke with measured caution. "We couldn't risk alerting them. If we hadn't staged this, we'd never have witnessed the depths of human treachery. To achieve their goals, they'd tarnish family honor, harm innocents, even murder their own blood."

Julian erupted in fury. "Lies! I have video proof on my phone! Olivia and William were clearly inappropriate! Everyone saw them embracing publicly! I'm telling the truth!"

The crowd Julian had incited began to settle. Everyone knew Eleanor Hawthorne—Julian's mother and William's youngest daughter—was suspected of attempting patricide.

The Whitmore family drama was a tangled web. If Julian's claims about their rightful inheritance were true, why would Eleanor poison William?

Moreover, Olivia and William's affectionate hug displayed nothing but familial warmth—transparent and innocent.

Alexander cleared his throat. "Ladies and gentlemen, family disputes are delicate matters. I ask you all to bear witness. Since Julian and Eleanor returned to the Whitmore estate, they've sown nothing but chaos. They've even self-harmed to frame me for assault. Failing to sway the family, they resorted to slandering my grandfather. Eleanor poisoned William for inheritance—I caught her red-handed. Their villainy is undeniable."

"Regarding Julian's video, Miss Rossi confirmed the footage wasn't even shot in my grandfather's hospital suite. It's clearly doctored. We'll have it forensically analyzed. If fabricated, Julian faces legal consequences. Let this be clear: Whitmore Holdings' legal team doesn't tolerate defamation."

The revelation stunned the gathering. Those who'd believed Julian and mocked Olivia now burned with shame.

Dozens of furious glares turned toward Julian and Evelyn, realizing they'd been manipulated into offending the Whitmores.

Evelyn cursed inwardly. Julian's incompetence had turned certain victory into disaster. If only she hadn't trusted this fool, she wouldn't be implicated now.

Evelyn hid behind Liam, whispering urgently, "Liam, these people are terrifying. Take me home. Now."

Before Liam could respond, Isabella blocked Evelyn's escape, smirking. "Miss Hartley, wasn't it you who called me a shameless mistress and threw stones? Your crocodile apology meant nothing. Clearly, you and Julian plotted this together."

Evelyn's voice cracked with false bravado. "This has nothing to do with me! Olivia has enemies everywhere. Julian deceived me too!"

Julian, panicking, lunged at Evelyn, clutching her ankle. "You can't abandon me now! You approached me with stories about Olivia clinging to Liam! You promised Blackwood support if things went south! This was your scheme—don't you dare deny it!"

Evelyn's face purpled with rage. "Release me! This is your mess, not mine! You manipulated me!"

Her desperate denials only cemented public disbelief.

The truth crystallized for all: Evelyn and Julian had conspired together.

Under the crowd's scorching contempt, Evelyn's composure shattered. "What are you gawking at? Remove this lunatic immediately!"

Olivia observed the spectacle with icy detachment.

Beyond Evelyn and Julian's humiliation, she studied Liam's reaction. Yet his expression remained unreadable as ever.

Did Liam feel remorse? Pity for Evelyn? Perhaps he truly cared for her.

Alexander stepped forward, amusement dancing in his eyes as he addressed the hysterical Evelyn. "Miss Hartley, Julian is a Whitmore matter. How we handle him is none of your concern. But rest assured—we'll uncover every accomplice in this plot against my grandfather. All will face justice."

Evelyn wobbled on her heels, nails biting into her palms. "How dare you imply—This is my birthday gala! I have every right to eject disruptors!"

Alexander chuckled. "Then perhaps you shouldn't have staged such a dramatic disruption."

"You—!" Evelyn nearly choked on her fury.

Liam pulled her back, his sculpted features glacial.

Evelyn's voice turned saccharine. "Mr. Whitmore, must you terrorize me to defend Olivia? I understand she's hurt, but must I bear the brunt? Liam, they're being monstrous!"

Liam ignored her, locking gazes with Alexander. The air crackled with tension.

Alexander arched a brow. "Mr. Blackwood, playing white knight? Let me be clear—we won't spare anyone who harmed Olivia."

Liam's voice cut like Arctic ice. "Olivia is my wife. I'll handle this."

The words "my wife" sent Olivia's pulse skittering.
###Chapter 195

Olivia felt neither sympathy nor emotion. She only found the situation ridiculous. Was Liam threatening Alexander? His implication was clear - their relationship remained unchanged, and the Blackwood family's affairs had nothing to do with the Whitmores.

Alexander's fists clenched so tightly his knuckles turned white. He looked like he was barely holding himself back.

Seeing the tension escalate, Olivia quickly moved forward and grasped Alexander's arm. She shook her head subtly, warning him against impulsive actions. Falling into Liam and Evelyn's trap would only lead to their downfall.

Catching Olivia's silent warning, Alexander took a deep breath and managed to restrain his temper.

Liam's gaze dropped. The sight of Olivia holding Alexander's arm stirred an uncomfortable feeling in his chest, darkening his mood further.

"I'm not here to discuss this. I need to speak with William," Liam commanded coldly, his piercing eyes locking with Alexander's.

Without waiting for a response, Liam strode toward William.

As he passed, Liam deliberately brushed against Alexander's shoulder. To casual observers it might have seemed accidental, but Alexander knew better - it was a calculated provocation.

Alexander gritted his teeth, shooting Olivia a sideways glance as he struggled to contain his irritation.

When Liam approached, William's associates immediately tensed, forming a protective circle around the wheelchair-bound patriarch while eyeing Liam with suspicion.

Liam merely raised an eyebrow, choosing silence over confrontation.

William cleared his throat. "It's alright," he instructed his men, then gave Liam a meaningful look. "It's been too long since we last spoke properly, Liam."

Liam responded with a rare, genuine smile. "Indeed. I meant to visit you at Mercy Hospital, but circumstances prevented me."

He then maneuvered William's wheelchair aside, as if finally making time for their overdue conversation.

Alexander watched them with visible anxiety. He wanted to follow but knew exactly how Liam would react. Interrupting would only make matters worse.

Noticing Alexander's concern, Olivia reassured him with gentle gestures that seemed to say, "Don't worry. Liam may seem unpredictable and stern, but he deeply respects his elders. He holds William in the same regard as his own grandfather."

This seemed to calm Alexander slightly, though his expression remained troubled. "After everything he's done to you, you still defend him?" he whispered.

Olivia shook her head, her eyes downcast with visible exhaustion. Her hands moved gracefully as she signed that she was merely stating facts, nothing more. She added that she'd accepted she and Liam were never meant to be together.

From across the room, Evelyn observed their exchange. Though she couldn't understand Olivia's sign language, Alexander's words were clear enough - they were discussing Liam.

A knot of unease twisted in Evelyn's stomach, tightening when Liam announced his intention to speak privately with William.

What if William said terrible things about her?

Evelyn believed she'd done nothing wrong. If anyone was at fault, it was Olivia for overreacting. Why did Olivia insist on staying in the city, constantly crossing paths with Liam when she was still technically married to him?

More importantly, Evelyn bitterly realized that with the Whitmore family's backing, Olivia was no longer the vulnerable orphan she once was.

What truly unsettled Evelyn was Liam and Olivia's shared childhood history. Around her, Liam appeared indifferent to Olivia. But what if memories of their past made him fall for Olivia again? The thought was unbearable.

Overcome with emotion, Evelyn stormed toward Olivia and grabbed her wrist violently. "Olivia, are you happy now? Look at you, relying on nothing but your pretty face! The Blackwoods rejected you, and soon the Whitmores will too. No one in this world wants you! You're just a parasite. That bastard child in your womb is just as unwanted as you are!"

Initially, Olivia dismissed Evelyn's baseless accusations, but when the attack turned toward her unborn child, fury overtook her. She raised her hand to strike.

But Evelyn anticipated this and yanked Olivia's hair instead.

Still weakened from being drugged earlier, Olivia lacked the strength to fight back effectively.

Evelyn seemed possessed, her attacks deliberately aimed at Olivia's abdomen.

Realizing Evelyn's malicious intent, Olivia stopped resisting and curled protectively around her belly.

Fortunately, Isabella quickly intervened, pulling Evelyn away while helping Olivia up. She glared at Evelyn with undisguised contempt. "Miss Hartley, you claim to despise Olivia, yet everyone can see it's you who's insecure. You mocked her as a voiceless orphan with no one to rely on. Yet this 'helpless mute' has outshone you at every turn. Even your so-called friends are abandoning you now."

Evelyn's thoughts turned to Liam, fueling her rage. She'd worked tirelessly to build connections with the Blackwood family, only to have Olivia destroy everything. Her anger was understandable.

Despite Liam's recent kindness toward her and apparent indifference to Olivia, Evelyn couldn't shake the fear that one day, Olivia might steal Liam away.

She refused to be defeated by someone like Olivia.

"Shut up!" Evelyn screamed, having completely lost her composure.

Alexander inhaled sharply before declaring, "I was willing to let you keep some dignity, but that's no longer possible. We're calling the police. Your involvement is undeniable."

"You're lying!" Evelyn snapped, panic creeping into her voice.

She desperately hoped someone would defend her. But as she scanned the room, only hostile stares met hers. Those who'd previously hesitated to confront her now looked at her with open disdain.

Evelyn's single-minded obsession with Liam had caused her to neglect old friendships. Now, facing their judgmental gazes, she suddenly felt like the loneliest person alive. A crushing sense of isolation overwhelmed her. Was all this chaos really worth it, just to make Olivia suffer?

"What's happening here?" Liam's voice cut through the tension as he returned with William.

Alexander, having just finished his call to the police, replied without looking up, his tone icy. "Ask Evelyn what she's done. She just attacked Olivia - deliberately targeting her stomach. She clearly knows about the pregnancy. Liam, do you really want to defend someone that cruel?"

Seeing Evelyn's guilty, lost expression, Liam could tell Alexander wasn't exaggerating.

Yet Liam's focus zeroed in on Evelyn's deliberate attack on Olivia's abdomen. A flicker of suspicion crossed his eyes. Who had told Evelyn about the pregnancy?

Did Evelyn believe the child was his? Or had someone intentionally misled her?

As these thoughts swirled, Liam's gaze shifted meaningfully back to William.
###Chapter 196

William understood Liam's pointed glance and cleared his throat toward Alexander. "Dismiss the officers. Inform them there's no issue here. We'll be leaving now."

Alexander's anxiety spiked. "Grandfather, Olivia's injured like this. Aren't we going to act?"

William studied Olivia with remorse-laden concern. "It's not that we won't act. The timing isn't right. We'll discuss this later."

Olivia offered William a reassuring smile, silently conveying her trust in his judgment. William was no fool. Clearly, Liam had presented something advantageous to the Whitmore family—something William couldn't easily refuse. Or perhaps Liam had uncovered a threat against Alexander.

Involving the Whitmores in her troubles already weighed heavily on Olivia.

She tugged gently at Alexander's sleeve, soothing his simmering fury. With subtle gestures, she implied William must have his reasons and expressed her exhaustion from the day's chaos. Grateful for their defense, she suggested Alexander escort William for a medical checkup, noting his pallor.

Alexander fell silent under Olivia's insistence, swallowing further protests.

Before departing, he shot Evelyn a withering glare. Leaning close to Olivia, he murmured, "Evelyn's schemes have backfired twice now. She's desperate—watch your back."

Olivia smiled faintly, touched by his protectiveness.

As the Whitmores left with Olivia, Liam's gaze tracked them intently.

Beside him, Evelyn seethed. "Liam, why let her go so easily? Look what she did to me!" She thrust out her wrist, displaying faint red marks, voice thick with indignation.

Liam finally turned to her, patience fraying. "You caused this mess. I convinced them not to hold you accountable. What more do you want?"

Evelyn stiffened, tears welling theatrically. "I told you—this wasn't my fault! Olivia offended Julian, not me. People spread rumors at my event. What was I supposed to do?"

Liam's lips curled into a sneer as he dismantled her lies. "Nothing to do with you? Stop lying. I know you've been conspiring with Julian. I tolerated it as long as you kept things contained. Yet even now, you lie to my face?"

Evelyn's mask slipped momentarily, but she recovered swiftly. If Liam had intervened, it meant he still cared. Emboldened, she pivoted to vilify Olivia. "It's all Olivia's fault! She clung to you using her pregnancy as leverage. When you weren't around, she insulted me and accused me of meddling. I was furious, so I allied with Julian. I never expected him to frame Olivia and William like this. I only agreed to involve him."

Liam ignored her fresh lies, piercing her with a glacial stare. "Who told you about the pregnancy? I explicitly forbade the household from revealing it. How did you find out?"

A chill slithered down Evelyn's spine—she'd slipped.

She scrambled for an excuse. "I could tell by Olivia's appearance."

Though Liam's expression remained neutral, his eyes frosted over. "You've disappointed me. I trusted you, yet you conspired behind my back."

Abruptly, he seized her wrist. "Still lying. What's next? Plotting to kill me?"

Evelyn recoiled, pulse hammering. Liam was right—he'd always treated her well, yet her insecurities had driven her to betrayal.

She weighed her options. Revealing the truth wouldn't harm her. Melinda was expendable. Protecting her wasn't worth Liam's wrath.

With a shaky breath, Evelyn confessed. "It was Catherine. When you took Olivia out, I ran into her. She mentioned you kept Olivia close because she's pregnant. I assumed it was yours. Liam, I know you care for me, but if Olivia uses that child to reclaim you, what happens to me?"

Liam barely registered her words as dizziness crashed over him, the familiar headache spiking. The world warped grotesquely around him. Knowing Evelyn's treachery, her feigned concern now revolted him.

Shoving her aside, he staggered through the crowd, desperate to find Olivia.

But he'd been the one to push her away. Why would she return?

Meanwhile, Olivia settled into the car beside William.

As the engine purred to life, distant ambulance sirens pierced the air.

Olivia frowned, gaze drifting toward the sound.

William sighed softly. "You've always borne your burdens silently. I know about your situation with Liam."

Olivia startled, gesturing—Did Liam tell you?

William evaded the question. "I also stopped Alexander from interfering, thinking he could force a divorce for you. This is between you and your husband. Alexander shouldn't meddle."

Olivia nodded. When she'd first heard Isabella's plan, she'd objected subtly but relented to avoid humiliating Alexander.

William's guilt deepened seeing her vulnerability. "Don't worry. I owe Henry my life, and he owed you his. The Whitmores will always protect you. While I live, no one will harm you."

Tears pricked Olivia's eyes. She signed her gratitude, urging him to prioritize his health.

William smiled warmly. "I'm fine. I suspected my daughter's treachery and took precautions. The doctor says I'll recover with rest."

Relief washed over Olivia.

Elsewhere, Evelyn frantically arranged Liam's hospitalization. Turning, she spotted suited men approaching.

Realization struck—Liam's collapse was no accident.

When no one noticed, she slipped to the hotel's penthouse.

Storming inside, she hurled her bag down. "You promised those drugs wouldn't harm Liam!"

...

...
###Chapter 197

The silhouette of a towering figure stood motionless behind the translucent screen, cigarette smoke curling lazily from his fingers as he gazed out the window.

Olivia's hesitant voice broke the silence. The man turned with deliberate slowness, his lips twisting into a frosty smile. "Miss Hartley, how bold of you to interrogate me first. But I have a question for you. Explain why today's operation failed so spectacularly? More importantly, why did you disappoint me?"

Evelyn's confidence shattered like glass. Her eyes darkened with shame as she stammered, "My plan mirrored yours perfectly. Olivia simply got lucky. How was I supposed to know that old man from the Whitmore family had been feigning illness all along? This isn't my failure - no one could have predicted that!"

CRASH! The sudden explosion of shattering porcelain made Evelyn jump backward as the man hurled his teacup against the floor.

Before she could react, four broad-shouldered guards materialized around her, their glacial stares promising violence.

Heart pounding, Evelyn whirled toward the shadowed figure. "What's the meaning of this?"

"You defy my orders, then dare question me in my own domain?" Though spoken softly, each word carried the lethal precision of a razor blade.

Evelyn's body betrayed her with an involuntary shudder. Gritting her teeth, she countered, "My plan followed your instructions exactly! Even if everything had gone perfectly, with the Whitmores backing Olivia, success was never guaranteed. Blaming me alone is unfair!"

A cruel chuckle slithered through the screen. "Still refusing to acknowledge your failures, Miss Hartley?"

His words struck like a physical blow, draining the color from Evelyn's face.

Before she could respond, rough hands seized her, binding her wrists and ankles with practiced efficiency.

All defiance evaporated as memories of the man's notorious brutality surfaced. She'd played with fire and now faced the burns.

Watching Evelyn's distress, the man's smile widened into something grotesque, eyes glittering with malice. "Miss Hartley, I believe Liam has grown quite fond of you. Since you claim to love him so passionately, why not suffer this punishment in his stead?"

At his signal, an assistant produced a medical case containing a ominous syringe.

Realization dawned with terrifying clarity. Evelyn shook her head violently, voice trembling. "H-he cares for me, but not deeply enough yet! I'm valuable to you! I should have listened - I was wrong! I won't disobey again!"

The assistant advanced relentlessly.

Evelyn squeezed her eyes shut, awaiting the inevitable.

"Enough." The man's bored voice cut through the tension. "This grows tedious. Release her."

When the restraints loosened, Evelyn collapsed to her knees, her blouse clinging to her sweat-slicked back.

"Fail me again," the man warned, "and the next dose will be yours. I can always replace you with a more obedient puppet. The choice is yours."

Swallowing her terror, Evelyn whispered, "Understood. It won't happen again."

A dismissive wave. "Get out."

Evelyn scrambled to her feet and fled.

Once the door closed, a subordinate approached cautiously. "Today proved Liam feels nothing for Olivia. Yet he protects Evelyn fiercely. Perhaps we should shift our strategy - targeting Evelyn might give us better leverage against Liam."

The man's laughter held no mirth. "Did you witness Evelyn's pathetic performance? Claiming love while cowering for self-preservation. I know Liam better than that. The drugs haven't affected him as planned. We may need... alternative measures."

"Understood," the subordinate nodded.

Below them, Evelyn's birthday celebration continued obliviously as the man's lips curved in contemplation.

Meanwhile, Liam stirred awake in Mercy Hospital, his first conscious act being to search the room for Olivia. Her absence carved a hollow ache in his chest that his observers misinterpreted.

Sebastian Montgomery was occupied managing the fallout of Liam's collapse. Assuming Liam sought Evelyn, his men ushered her in immediately.

Relief flooded Evelyn's features as she rushed to Liam's bedside. "Are you in pain? Should I call the doctor?"

Liam's response was terse. "I'm fine. Don't trouble yourself."

Perching on the mattress edge, Evelyn wrestled with guilt over her earlier confrontation. "Liam... this is all my fault."

His eyebrow arched. "Your fault? Have you been scheming behind my back?"

The confession died on Evelyn's tongue. She couldn't bring herself to reveal the truth. "Nothing," she muttered. "I just regret throwing this party. It caused you stress, made you collapse..." She hesitated before adding, "And Olivia... she's poisonous. If the Whitmores want her, let them have her. Please, Liam, send her away."

Liam turned his face away, voice flat. "You know why she stays. She carries my child. That child remains with me."

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms. "You're truly keeping it?"

Instead of answering, Liam countered, "What else has Catherine told you?"

Evelyn hesitated before confessing, "She said... if Olivia and the baby stay, I'll never be your wife." The lie tasted bitter - Catherine's warnings had been more subtle.

Liam's eyes flashed with something dangerous before his expression smoothed. "Richard and I are currently... estranged. If you care for me, you'll distance yourself from him and Catherine."

Evelyn's smile froze. This was unexpected - Catherine had never mentioned any rift.

The realization struck like lightning: she'd been manipulated, a pawn in someone else's game.

Watching comprehension dawn across Evelyn's features, Liam allowed himself a small, satisfied smile. Exactly as planned.
###Chapter 198

"I need to rest now. You should go," Liam declared, his voice heavy with exhaustion.

Evelyn nodded, worry lines creasing her forehead. "Of course, Liam. Just know the hospital can contact me immediately if anything changes. Please, get some proper rest," she murmured before slipping out quietly.

The moment Evelyn's footsteps faded, the warmth in Liam's eyes vanished, replaced by an arctic sharpness.

Snatching his phone, Liam dialed Sebastian. "Track down the physician who treated Olivia's case before. I require a private consultation. Ensure absolute discretion."

Meanwhile, Olivia stepped through the wrought-iron gates of the Whitmore estate, flanked by Julian and other family members.

Gone was Julian's characteristic arrogance as he crossed the threshold this time. His shoulders slumped in defeat, gaze fixed on the marble floor.

Alexander turned to Olivia with genuine remorse. "I never should've subjected you to this spectacle. But considering how Julian and Eleanor conspired against you, you deserved to witness their downfall firsthand." His voice thickened. "Forgive me for today's unpleasantness. The Whitmores should've uncovered their schemes sooner."

Olivia responded with a gentle headshake and understanding smile, silently conveying she held no blame toward the Whitmore family for Julian and Eleanor's misdeeds.

Alexander's lips curved slightly in wordless gratitude, their shared comprehension needing no further explanation.

William's aged hands trembled as he pushed himself from the wheelchair to claim the head chair in the grand hall.

Watching this, the kneeling Julian and Eleanor blanched like ghosts.

"You...you're not ill at all!" Eleanor shrieked, realization dawning. "This was all an act!"

William regarded them with glacial detachment, though sorrow flickered beneath his steely gaze.

How could he not grieve? Eleanor was his flesh and blood, and though Julian hadn't been raised under his roof, they shared the same lineage. Yet these two had plotted not only his demise but the usurpation of the entire Whitmore legacy.

Since their return, William had instructed Alexander to treat them fairly.

But their actions continually tested Alexander's patience - nearly selling family secrets multiple times. Left with no choice, William had warned Alexander to remain vigilant against the treacherous pair.

The final straw came when Julian sought alliance with Liam.

While Liam publicly played along, he privately alerted William to the conspiracy.

The betrayal forced William into this elaborate charade.

"Treacherous snake!" William roared, his cane striking the floor as he surged to his feet.

With startling speed for his age, he crossed to Julian and delivered a stinging slap that echoed through the hall.

Eleanor howled like a wounded animal, launching herself at William with venomous hatred. "How dare you strike my son! He's your own grandson! If he suffers for this, you'll regret it till your dying breath!"

Alexander's face twisted in pained disbelief. "Mind your tongue when addressing Grandfather. Have you forgotten he's your father? Or does Julian alone hold your loyalty?"

Eleanor's eyes burned with defiance. "Julian is my only family. Why should I care about any of you? Did you spare a thought for my suffering during those years with the Hawthornes?"

William's chest heaved with barely contained fury, his trembling finger pointing accusingly at his daughter.

Olivia moved swiftly to steady William, shooting Eleanor a withering glare.

Secretly, Olivia seethed with resentment.

Born into privilege, Eleanor had squandered her birthright. Spoiled and naive, she'd thrown away everything for a worthless man's empty promises.

Some might call it poetic justice. Convinced she'd found true love despite her family's warnings, Eleanor had severed ties with them.

Though William couldn't bring himself to visit, he'd consistently supported Eleanor financially from his personal funds.

Not extravagantly, but enough for comfort.

Yet their greed proved boundless. Julian's father succumbed to gambling debts, bankrupting them.

When William offered them sanctuary within the Whitmore fold, Eleanor had not only refused but demanded continued subsidies.

Naturally, William refused.

So Eleanor cut contact entirely.

While her youthful mistakes could be attributed to naivety, her subsequent choices were hers alone.

Olivia thought bitterly - if she had family like William, she'd cherish them beyond measure.

Despite everything, William still offered Eleanor redemption.

Composing himself, William spoke calmly. "Eleanor, I understand you're easily manipulated and lack conviction. Was this all Julian's doing? Confess now, and I'll arrange for you to live abroad comfortably. We need never meet again, but you'll want for nothing."

It was practically absolution.

Even Julian gaped at such leniency. Why couldn't he receive similar mercy?

Eleanor's jaw set stubbornly. "I'll always choose my son over you, old man. Nothing will ever come between us!"

Her declaration shattered when Julian suddenly crawled to William, clutching his trousers like a beggar.

"Grandfather, please!" Julian whimpered. "The plots to return and poison you were Mother's schemes! I'm innocent! How could I conceive such wickedness? She filled my head with lies about you since childhood!"

Eleanor swayed as if struck, her breath coming in ragged gasps of betrayal.

William studied Julian with disgust before delivering a brutal kick to his ribs.

"Pathetic worm!" William thundered. "You'd sell out the woman who bore you? Without her, you wouldn't exist!"

Julian's pained cry filled the hall as Eleanor stood frozen, tears carving silent paths down her ashen cheeks.
###Chapter 199

Eleanor's eyes burned with a toxic cocktail of emotions—rage and remorse twisting together in an ugly dance. But it was far too late for second chances.

Even as Eleanor pleaded for William's mercy, his expression remained carved from stone. "Effective immediately, you and Julian are no longer members of the Hayes family."

The finality of his words struck Eleanor like a physical blow. Her voice cracked, raw with desperation. "Father, how can you disown me? I'm your only daughter. If Mother were alive—"

William, once a pillar of strength, now looked decades older in mere seconds.

Olivia had never seen such exhaustion etched into the patriarch's face before.

With a heavy sigh, William delivered his verdict. "Eleanor and Julian will remain under house arrest until they confess everything. After that, they'll be exiled overseas. And ensure they each leave with a broken leg—consider it a parting gift."

The sentence shattered whatever fragile hope Eleanor and Julian clung to. Their desperate sobs twisted into venomous curses.

Olivia exhaled quietly. At least William hadn't succumbed to Eleanor's emotional blackmail. Keeping vipers like them in the family would only invite disaster.

William massaged his temples, weariness weighing down his words. "I need to rest. Alexander, stay. We have matters to discuss."

His gaze flickered briefly to Olivia before he turned away.

She couldn't decipher his intentions, but instinct warned her she was somehow involved.

Meanwhile, Sebastian burst into Liam's hospital room, his expression grim. "Mr. Blackwood, just as you predicted—the doctor has vanished. Not just him, but his entire family. And we traced a large sum deposited into his wife's account... under Margaret's name."

Liam's jaw tightened. Something reeked of conspiracy. Margaret didn't even know about Olivia's pregnancy—how would she have connections to this doctor?

Ever since their explosive argument, Liam's relationship with Margaret had deteriorated, though she'd grown closer to Richard and Catherine.

Recalling how Catherine had "coincidentally" appeared at the hospital that day, Liam didn't need a confession to connect the dots.

He snapped.

Ripping the IV from his arm, Liam ignored Sebastian's alarmed protest. "Mr. Blackwood! The doctors said you can't afford stress right now—"

Pale-faced, Liam barely registered the pain. "I need to find Olivia. Now. That child—it can't be Alexander's. It can't be."

The thought made him want to punch himself. How had he been so blind?

Liam knew exactly why he'd missed the signs—Olivia had always attracted admirers like wildfire.

Growing up, he'd resorted to icy glares and thinly veiled threats to scare off her suitors. "Keep hanging around those losers, and you'll be out on the street."

It worked. Olivia would shrink back, too intimidated to entertain their advances.

But Liam knew the truth—if Olivia ever truly loved someone else, he'd be powerless to stop her.

Was the baby his? The question haunted him, dragging up memories of her first pregnancy.

Back then, he'd been overjoyed—only to have his hopes obliterated when she terminated it.

The pain had been unbearable. Did she hate him so much she couldn't bear his child?

Afterward, doctors declared Olivia unlikely to conceive again. Heartbroken, Liam had meticulously used protection, respecting her choice.

Now, faced with the possibility that this child was his, one question tormented him: Why had she hidden it?

He needed answers. Now.

Sebastian barely managed to block the door as Liam shoved past him. "Mr. Blackwood, if you act recklessly now, everything we've worked for—"

Liam wasn't listening. His breaths came in ragged bursts, eyes bloodshot with barely restrained fury.

Realizing reason wouldn't prevail, Sebastian yanked out his phone and dialed Olivia. "Mrs. Blackwood, listen carefully. Liam is unstable right now. Do not meet him under any circumstances."

Olivia froze. "Liam wants to see me?"

Sebastian scrambled for an excuse. "He's... planning to propose to Evelyn this month. He has questions about the past. If this leaks, it could ruin their relationship."

Olivia's response was icy. "Proposing to Evelyn? Then when is he signing the divorce papers?"

Sebastian winced. Liam had no intention of signing anything.

He inhaled sharply. "I'll ensure he signs them promptly. Just... stay away today."

Olivia hung up without another word.

Seconds later, Liam's calls flooded her phone. When she ignored them, texts followed—frantic, demanding.

We need to talk. Face to face.

Gritting her teeth, Olivia powered off her phone.

The storm was coming. And she refused to be caught in its path.
###Chapter 200

The sky cracked open without warning, unleashing a torrential downpour that hammered against the windows.

Olivia stood motionless by the glass, her fingers tracing the cold surface as she watched the rain blur the world outside.

Her gaze drifted to the grand piano nestled beside the window—an instrument she hadn't touched in years.

Memories surged forward unbidden, each one tied to the man who had once taught her to play—Liam Blackwood.

Liam had been a prodigy, effortlessly mastering anything he set his mind to.

Even his hobbies became obsessions, pursued with the same intensity as his professional endeavors.

The piano had been one such passion.

But Margaret Winslow, his mother, had despised it, calling it a frivolous waste of time. She had smashed every piano he brought home in fits of rage.

So Liam had sought refuge at his grandfather’s estate, where he could play undisturbed.

Olivia had watched him, mesmerized. When he wasn’t around, she had tried to teach herself, fumbling through clumsy notes until his amused voice cut through her concentration.

Despite his teasing, he had sat beside her, his fingers gliding effortlessly over the keys.

Eventually, he had offered to teach her—on one condition: she had to cover for him when needed.

Truthfully, Olivia had never cared for the piano.

Her only interest had been Liam.

Now, standing before the instrument, she cringed at the memory of her teenage infatuation. How foolish she had been.

Her fingers hovered over the keys before pressing down, coaxing out a melody she hadn’t played in years.

Rusty but recognizable, the notes filled the room—the same song Liam had always played on rainy days.

The music intertwined with the storm outside, her sorrow bleeding into the rhythm.

But she couldn’t remember the rest. The abrupt silence snapped her back to reality.

Then, through the rain-streaked glass, she saw him.

A man in a hospital gown, sitting beneath a tree in the garden, drenched and unmoving.

Her pulse spiked. Sebastian Montgomery’s warning echoed in her mind.

Liam.

How had he found her so quickly?

She had assumed he would start with the Whitmores, that William and Alexander would delay him. But here he was, outside her door.

Heart pounding, she cracked the window open, ignoring the rain that lashed at her face.

There was no mistaking that face—sharp, striking, and unnervingly pale.

Liam looked up, spotting her instantly. His hand lifted, beckoning her down.

Olivia’s grip tightened on the windowsill.

He wasn’t leaving.

If she didn’t go to him, he would stay there, stubborn as always.

She exhaled sharply, then slammed the window shut.

Her phone was dead. Calling Sebastian was pointless anyway—if he could have stopped Liam, he wouldn’t have warned her in the first place.

She weighed her options.

Liam’s face was too recognizable. It was only a matter of time before someone saw him. And Evelyn Hartley would definitely use this to stir trouble.

Olivia hesitated, then glanced outside again.

Liam swayed slightly, his body trembling in the cold. She had never seen him look so… fragile.

Decision made, she grabbed an umbrella and rushed out.

The rain soaked her within seconds. Liam was heavier than she expected, his weight nearly buckling her knees.

She gritted her teeth, forcing herself forward.

Careful. The baby.

Inside, she shoved him onto the sofa, then pointed firmly at her stomach, her expression sharp.

Liam, stop this. I don’t care about you and Evelyn. And I’m pregnant—this is harassment.

His dazed eyes cleared instantly.

Then, without warning, he surged forward, closing the distance between them.

Olivia stumbled back until the wall stopped her.

Before she could sign, he grabbed her wrist, silencing her.

His voice was rough. "Tell me the truth, Olivia. Whose child is this?"

The question struck like a slap.

Her breath caught.

Disbelief. Anger. Hurt.

She had known he resented the pregnancy—but to deny it was his?

She wrenched free and struck him.

The sound echoed in the room.

Liam didn’t react with anger. Instead, his lips curved—just slightly.

Then his expression crumpled.

"I’m sorry," he whispered, pulling her into a crushing embrace. "I was wrong. I misunderstood everything."

Olivia stiffened.

Misunderstood?

What did that mean?

She had sworn to keep her distance, but now…

Before she could process it, Liam’s body went slack.

He collapsed.

Olivia barely caught him, her heart hammering.

She shot Sebastian a frantic message, then dragged Liam to the bedroom, her abdomen aching with the strain.

By the time she got him onto the bed, she was drenched in sweat.

Gasping, she sank beside him.

Even unconscious, his lips moved, murmuring something.

Curious, she leaned closer.

And froze.

The name on his lips—

Was hers.
###Chapter 201

Olivia barely caught the name Liam was murmuring when the door burst open.

Sebastian Montgomery rushed in, his breathing ragged. His gaze landed on Liam, unconscious on the bed, and a sharp pain lanced through his temples.

Relief flooded Olivia's veins at the sight of Sebastian.

She stepped aside quickly, pulling out her phone to type. "Something felt off about him. I can't explain it. Knowing Liam's condition had to stay private, I didn't call an ambulance."

Sebastian gave her an appreciative nod. "Ms. Sinclair, your quick thinking saved us today. Thank you. I'll take over from here."

As Sebastian took control, Olivia's fingers flew across her screen again. "Can you at least tell me what's wrong with Liam? Just the basics - is it serious?"

After a beat, she added, "I'm not prying. We're still technically married. It's only natural I'd care about his health."

Sebastian shifted uncomfortably. "I'd love to tell you, but this knowledge could put you in danger."

Olivia offered him a small, understanding smile. "It's alright. If it's classified, I won't press further."

With a heavy sigh, Sebastian motioned for the security team to move Liam out.

Just then, Liam's eyelids fluttered open.

The guards alerted Sebastian, who rushed over, relief evident on his face. "Mr. Blackwood, you're awake. How do you feel? Any pain? Headache?"

Liam's brow furrowed as he scanned the room, his dark eyes clouded with confusion. "What happened? Why am I here? Why am I wearing this?" His questions seemed directed at everyone, but his intense gaze remained locked on Olivia.

She met his stare, baffled by his sudden intensity.

Only Sebastian understood the reason behind Liam's odd behavior. He sighed inwardly.

The doctors had warned that prolonged exposure to the drugs without proper treatment might cause memory lapses or confusion.

Now it appeared Liam had forgotten why he'd come to see Olivia.

In a way, this was fortuitous.

Sebastian knew the child Olivia carried was Liam's, not Alexander's. Letting Liam believe otherwise might be the safest option for now. If the CEO himself was misled, others would follow suit.

Thinking quickly, Sebastian interjected, "Mr. Blackwood, you had a bit too much at Evelyn Hartley's birthday gala and had a minor accident. Let's get you out of here, and I'll brief you properly."

Liam nodded and stood.

Olivia studied him closely. The warmth she'd seen in his eyes moments ago had vanished. The vulnerable man from an hour before might as well have been a stranger.

As Liam's entourage moved toward the exit, they nearly collided with Alexander Hayes, who'd come to check on Olivia.

Dressed casually instead of his usual formal wear, Alexander carried a bag of fresh fruit. "Olivia, Grandfather mentioned you loved these. He sent me to check on you, so I picked some up on the way—" He broke off mid-sentence when he spotted Liam.

Liam stood there in his hospital gown, surrounded by his security team.

The sight made Alexander instantly tense. He stepped protectively in front of Olivia, his gaze sharpening. "What are you doing here?"

Liam's eyes flicked between Olivia and Alexander standing so close. A cold smile twisted his lips. Had he not shown up unexpectedly, they might have been enjoying a cozy domestic moment right now.

The thought sent a surge of anger through him. "Mr. Hayes, that's an interesting question. I'm visiting my wife. You make it sound like I'm trespassing. Shouldn't I be asking you that?"

Alexander's hands clenched into fists. "Liam, remember what you did to Olivia. If you're set on being with Evelyn, then sign the divorce papers and let her go. Why keep her trapped in this misery?"

Liam remained unruffled. "Alexander, has your grandfather's advice slipped your mind?"

Alexander's expression shifted subtly.

Just days ago, William Hayes had summoned him to the study with one request: stay out of Liam and Olivia's marital affairs. While he could support Olivia, meddling in their personal matters was forbidden.

When Alexander protested, citing concern for Olivia's wellbeing, William's response had been cutting. "You know exactly why you're interfering. I won't have another Hayes family scandal. Olivia can make her own decisions - respect that."

The memory still stung.

Alexander lowered his hands and set the fruit aside. "Grandfather would like to see you more often. Perhaps you could join him for dinner when you're free."

Olivia smiled and nodded, promising to visit William soon.

Alexander turned back to Liam. "Mr. Blackwood, since you're leaving, mind if I walk out with you? We can talk on the way."

Liam didn't refuse, gesturing for Alexander to lead.

Once they'd gone, the previously bustling apartment fell silent.

Olivia retreated to her bedroom, closing the door behind her. She replayed Liam's strange behavior until her thoughts became too tangled.

Nothing made sense. The Liam from before the attack seemed like a completely different person. She'd never seen him so vulnerable. A nagging suspicion told her something wasn't right.

Closing her eyes, she heard Liam's voice again, asking about her baby's father. His admission of past mistakes. His desire to make things right.

The more she tried to piece it together, the more confused she became. With a soft exhale, she chalked it up to exhaustion and stress.

Meanwhile, Liam underwent a full medical workup at Mercy Hospital. Once cleared, Sebastian handled his discharge.

Liam studied his wristwatch, deep in thought. Though Sebastian had debriefed him and everything seemed in order, something felt... off.
###Chapter 202

Liam couldn't shake the unsettling feeling that something wasn't adding up. Why had he suddenly appeared at Olivia's place without any memory of going there? The gaps in his recollection were growing more concerning by the day.

A cold dread crept down his spine. The forgotten events seemed trivial compared to the real danger - the mysterious medication causing more than just debilitating headaches. The terrifying possibility that it might be erasing his memories and compromising his need for control made his blood run cold.

"Sebastian!" Liam's voice cut through the silence like a whip.

Sebastian rushed in immediately, concern etched on his features. "Mr. Blackwood, is everything alright?"

Liam's expression was granite. "Exactly how much time have I lost?"

"At least seventy-two hours, sir," Sebastian answered carefully.

Liam's fist slammed against the railing, his knuckles turning white from the force. Taking a measured breath, he knew drastic changes were necessary.

"Bring Olivia back. Assign our best security detail to watch her every move. If the situation escalates, relocate her to an undisclosed location - somewhere even I can't find." Liam's voice was steel. "Contact the top neurological specialists worldwide. We're ending this medical mystery now."

Sebastian exhaled heavily. Liam had originally intended to play the long game. They'd been gathering evidence meticulously. Yet despite their efforts, the puppet master remained frustratingly out of reach.

Recognizing he'd lost control of the situation, Liam made his decisive move.

As Olivia stepped out of Whitmore Holdings after work, she immediately noticed the familiar black sedan in the parking lot, flanked by Liam's unmistakable security team.

The car idled quietly near Olivia, as if afraid she might overlook it and walk away. Drawing a steadying breath, she approached and rapped sharply on the tinted window.

The glass lowered to reveal Sebastian's apologetic face. "Mrs. Blackwood, please come with us."

Olivia inhaled deeply before pulling out her phone. "I believe Liam and I had an agreement about my independence. I've just settled into Whitmore Holdings, and with William's improving health, this is exactly when I should be establishing my own routine."

Sebastian cleared his throat formally. "The situation has changed. Mr. Blackwood insists you return to the estate. You'll have complete privacy - neither he nor Miss Hartley will be present. As for your movements, simply inform Mr. Blackwood of your plans in advance. Our staff will ensure your safety at all times."

Olivia's laugh was sharp with irony. "And how exactly is this different from being under constant surveillance?"

Unable to argue, Sebastian simply opened the car door. "Mrs. Blackwood, my hands are tied. Please understand my position."

Olivia considered her limited options. She'd made promises to Liam before. Clearly, he still viewed her as leverage against Alexander.

With the immediate Hayes family crisis resolved, Olivia reasoned that if her cooperation could prevent further trouble for them, she could tolerate Liam's demands a while longer. Without Evelyn around, at least the complications would be fewer.

With reluctant resignation, Olivia stepped into the vehicle.

At Blackwood Enterprises, Liam had just concluded a board meeting when he spotted Evelyn waiting by his office door.

She looked weary from waiting, but her face lit up at the sight of him.

"Liam, I've been trying to reach you all day! I'm exhausted. Can we go home now?" Evelyn asked with hopeful eyes.

Liam withdrew his arm from her grasp, his expression unreadable. "Not tonight. The company requires my full attention."

Evelyn's smile froze, then shattered. This cold detachment from Liam was new - and terrifying.

A wave of panic rising, she ventured carefully, "Liam... are you still angry about what happened with Olivia?"

For the first time, Liam turned fully to face her, his gaze glacial. "What do you think?"

Evelyn's voice trembled. "But you must understand - I love you. Everything I did was because of that love. If I didn't care, would I be so upset about another woman carrying your child?"

Suddenly, realization dawned on her. She stepped closer, voice tight. "You still have feelings for Olivia, don't you? That's the real reason you're so furious."

She searched Liam's face desperately for any reaction. Found nothing but impenetrable ice.

As Evelyn voiced her accusation, Liam merely smirked. "If that's your conclusion, we have nothing more to discuss. Since we clearly can't communicate effectively, perhaps separation would be best. Return to the Hartley estate. Don't contact me. Don't come to the Blackwood residence. I'll be staying at corporate headquarters."

Brushing past Evelyn, he walked away without a backward glance.

"Liam!" she cried desperately, moving to follow. Sebastian blocked her path.

Overcome with rage, Evelyn slapped Sebastian without thinking. "Get out of my way!"

The blow startled Sebastian, fury flashing in his eyes. But remembering his orders, he restrained himself.

"Miss Hartley, I understand your distress, but you're misinterpreting the situation," he said carefully.

Hatred burned in Evelyn's gaze as she hissed, "Then explain it to me! That scheming bitch Olivia - why won't she let go? Liam doesn't love her anymore! Can't she see that? Using her pregnancy to trap him - does she really think I'm powerless against her?"

The venom in her voice was palpable.

Sebastian felt a headache coming on. He guided her aside. "Miss Hartley, you should know - the child isn't Mr. Blackwood's."

"What?" Evelyn blinked, thrown off balance.

Sebastian continued, "The father is actually Alexander Hayes. Mr. Blackwood has been keeping Olivia close as insurance against the Hayes family. With all the corporate threats and his declining health, he saw no other option."

"The hospital staff and Catherine know the truth. I'm not sure why Catherine told you otherwise. Mr. Blackwood is upset because your lack of trust has wounded him deeply. I'm only sharing this confidential information because he authorized me to do so."
###Chapter 203

Olivia's spirits lifted instantly at Sebastian's words. The fury in her eyes dissolved, replaced by an involuntary smile. "I knew Liam still cared about me," she murmured, satisfaction coloring her voice.

Yet frustration soon crept into Olivia's tone. "But Sebastian, tell me honestly - is Liam so angry he won't even see me?"

Sebastian exhaled heavily. "Miss Hartley, you're overthinking this. If Mr. Blackwood were truly that upset, would I be here having this conversation? Every word I've spoken comes directly from Mr. Blackwood's confidence. Should Catherine or Margaret decide to visit unexpectedly, you must be extremely careful not to reveal anything."

"Of course," Olivia agreed with an earnest nod.

Her expression darkened with concern. "But Liam's still angry with me. How can I make amends? You've been his closest advisor for years. Any suggestions?"

Sebastian appeared to deliberate before responding, "Perhaps it would be wise to follow Mr. Blackwood's advice. Limit visits to his family and avoid seeing him at Blackwood Enterprises. Some distance might help him appreciate your thoughtfulness."

The suggestion visibly relieved Olivia. "Don't worry, I understand. Though it's shocking how that witch Evelyn managed to seduce Alexander after realizing Liam was out of reach. Since Liam plans to use the child against Alexander, I'll hold off on dealing with her."

With a casual toss of her hair, Olivia added, "I'll wait before visiting Liam again." She strode away confidently in her designer heels.

Sebastian sighed in relief, grateful he'd managed to placate Olivia. At least there would be peace for a few days.

Meanwhile, Evelyn remained blissfully unaware of the tension between Liam and Olivia. Their absence from the Winslow estate allowed her to enjoy several tranquil days.

But Evelyn soon realized this peace wouldn't last.

Returning home from work one evening, Evelyn noticed multiple Rolls-Royces parked outside the gates, sending a chill down her spine.

Recognizing the vehicles, Evelyn considered fleeing, but it was too late.

The security guard spotted her immediately. "Madam, your mother-in-law has arrived," he informed her. "She insists on seeing you immediately regarding an urgent matter."

Evelyn pressed her lips together and began typing on her phone: "I have prior commitments tonight. Please inform her we can reschedule."

Just as she finished the message and turned to leave, a sharp female voice stopped her cold. "Living in my son's house and trying to avoid me? What nonsense is this?"

Evelyn's heart pounded as she spun to face Margaret, her expression turning icy.

Margaret advanced with her entourage, radiating hostility.

Evelyn recalled hearing from staff about Margaret and Liam's falling out over some disagreement, which had strained their relationship and reduced Margaret's visits.

She'd almost believed she'd never see Margaret again.

Yet there she stood, scrutinizing Evelyn's defensive posture with undisguised contempt. "Considering you're still legally married to my son, isn't your reaction to seeing your mother-in-law rather extreme?"

Evelyn responded in sign language, explaining she was divorcing Liam and only staying temporarily for specific reasons. She emphasized any questions should be directed to Liam.

Sign language had been mandatory during Henry's time, but Margaret, who despised Evelyn, had always resented it.

Previously, Evelyn avoided signing around Margaret to please her.

But things had changed. The Winslow family's concerns no longer occupied Evelyn's thoughts. She was living for herself now, embracing newfound freedom.

Margaret scoffed and gestured to her guards. "Can't you see this woman lacks basic manners? Escort her inside. It's disgraceful having her make a scene at the door."

Evelyn's expression turned glacial as she assessed the surrounding guards. Resistance would only worsen her situation.

Muttering curses under her breath about Liam, Evelyn reluctantly followed Margaret into the mansion.

Meanwhile, to appease Olivia, Liam had invited her to dinner.

Adoration shone in Olivia's eyes as she gazed at Liam. With fewer people around, she might have thrown herself into his arms.

Glancing around, Olivia voiced discomfort: "Why choose such a crowded restaurant? All these eyes on us feel rather awkward."

Liam offered a gentle smile. "Isn't this your favorite restaurant? I specifically chose this place, though reservations are notoriously difficult to secure." Olivia nodded, acknowledging the truth in his words.

Indeed, it was the city's most exclusive dining establishment, popular among elite circles. Reservations typically required weeks of advance notice. Liam appeared to have made a thoughtful selection.

Unbeknownst to Olivia, Sebastian had actually chosen the venue.

Liam had insisted they didn't need privacy - the more witnesses, the better.

Had Sebastian not feared Olivia causing a scene, he might have selected a more modest location.

Just then, Liam's phone buzzed. His expression shifted as he glanced at the screen.

Curious, Olivia leaned in.

With practiced ease, Liam angled the phone away. "An urgent work call," he explained.

Despite his efforts, Olivia glimpsed the Winslow estate's main number displayed. She longed to confront Liam about his lie but feared his reaction.

Liam ignored the call, but when it rang again, he excused himself.

Watching his hurried departure, Olivia felt anxiety rising.

Out of sight, Liam's expression turned grim. "Is Evelyn in trouble?" he demanded.

The reply came urgently: "Your mother arrived unexpectedly. The situation seems volatile. You need to return immediately."

Liam immediately headed for the exit. "Keep my mother calm. I'll be there shortly," he instructed before ending the call.

He dialed Sebastian. "Margaret's causing problems for Evelyn again. I'm heading back. Make an excuse to Olivia. Dinner's canceled."

Sebastian hesitated. "Miss Hartley has been suspicious lately. If you leave now, she might create a scene."

"Let her," Liam replied coldly. "I'm done playing these games."

Sebastian exhaled deeply. "Understood."

He knew when Evelyn was involved, Liam's judgment clouded. Once Liam made a decision, no one could change it.

Left with no choice, Sebastian prepared to handle Olivia alone.
###Chapter 204

"On your knees," Margaret commanded sharply as they entered the dimly lit room.

The matriarch of the Winslow family settled gracefully into an armchair, crossing her legs with deliberate arrogance as she stared down at Olivia with undisguised contempt.

Olivia's jaw clenched, her body refusing to submit.

"Do you require a demonstration of proper etiquette, or shall I have someone assist you?" Margaret's voice dripped with mockery as she examined her manicured nails.

Standing tall, Olivia met the older woman's gaze with equal frostiness. Her hands moved in sharp, deliberate signs. "I won't kneel. Whatever grievance you have today, remember we're bound by law now."

Margaret's lips twisted into a cruel smile. "You stubbornly refuse to divorce Liam, which means you remain my daughter-in-law. That gives me every right to discipline you. Tell me, which law does that violate?"

With a careless flick of her wrist, Margaret signaled her guards.

A towering security officer immediately stepped forward, forcing Olivia to her knees with brutal efficiency. The sharp impact of bone against marble drew a pained gasp from Olivia's lips.

Margaret observed the scene with detached amusement, convinced Olivia was exaggerating her discomfort.

"How fragile you've become," Margaret sneered. "Does pregnancy suddenly make you think you're above following orders?"

Olivia's face paled visibly. Her hands trembled as realization dawned - they knew about the baby.

Memories of her first pregnancy came flooding back.

When Margaret had discovered Olivia's previous pregnancy, she'd demanded an immediate termination, claiming someone of Olivia's background couldn't possibly produce a healthy Winslow heir.

But this time was different. This child was everything to Olivia.

Overcome with desperation, Olivia's hands flew in frantic signs. She promised to leave Liam, to take the child far away, to sign any document Margaret required. She'd accept any punishment if she ever broke her word.

"Still performing?" Margaret's voice turned venomous. "That bastard you're carrying isn't even Liam's. We both know who the real father is."

A bitter smile touched Olivia's lips at the blatant lie. Margaret would say anything to destroy her own grandchild.

Protectively cradling her stomach, Olivia silently vowed to shield her baby at all costs.

Margaret continued coldly, "Everything's arranged at Mercy Hospital. The procedure happens tonight. Tomorrow you'll sign divorce papers. The day after, I'll put you on a plane to anywhere you choose - with one condition. You never return to this city."

Olivia's nails dug into her palms. Who gave them the right to control her life? To dictate her future?

Seeing Olivia's defiant expression, Margaret scoffed. "Don't look at me like that. The Winslows have supported you for years. This is the least you can do in return. Remember, only Henry ever wanted you in this family. The rest of us tolerated you as an outsider. Stop playing the victim."

Turning to her security team, Margaret ordered, "Get moving. I want confirmation of the procedure's completion by nine tonight. If she resists, use whatever force necessary - just keep her breathing."

As the bodyguards advanced, Olivia fought like a wildcat, but their grip was unbreakable. Tears of helpless rage streaked her face as they dragged her toward the door.

Then suddenly, the guards froze.

"Mr. Blackwood," they acknowledged respectfully.

Hope flared in Olivia's chest as Liam strode into the room. But it died just as quickly when he walked right past her without a glance.

"Put her in the car," Liam said tonelessly. "I need to speak with my mother."

Olivia's struggles intensified. Was this all Liam's doing? Had he sent Margaret to do his dirty work?

The betrayal cut deep. They'd made a promise about the baby. Now she saw him for the liar he was, hot tears burning down her cheeks.

Meanwhile, Margaret massaged her temples wearily. "What's this about? Weren't you supposed to be having dinner with Evelyn tonight?"

Liam's jaw tightened. "I should be asking you the same question. What are you doing here?"

Margaret lifted her chin defiantly. "A mother can't visit her son? If I hadn't been tipped off, I wouldn't have known about this madness. What's your plan? Keep Olivia close until she delivers, then raise another man's child as your own?"

"The baby is Alexander's," Liam snapped. "I have no interest in raising Hayes' bastard."

Margaret saw through him instantly. "It doesn't matter whose child it is. It's your intentions that concern me. If she'd truly betrayed you, you'd have discarded her already. You can't let her go, can you?"

With a violent crash, Liam shattered a vase against the wall. "Don't you dare speak about her that way!"

Margaret rose, disappointment etching her features. "Look at you. Defying your own mother for a woman. After everything I've done for you."

Liam's gaze turned glacial. "Grandfather was the one who raised me. You only taught me cruelty and deception in your pursuit of power. I refuse to become you."

The venom in his voice made Margaret recoil.

"Liam, what's happened to you?" she asked, genuinely shaken. "You've always obeyed me. Is Olivia really worth this?"

Rubbing his temples, Liam exhaled sharply. "Don't rewrite history. You know exactly why things are this way. Olivia's safety isn't negotiable. That's my final word. If you can't accept that, then perhaps you shouldn't consider yourself my mother anymore."

Margaret gasped, hand flying to her mouth. "You'd disown your own mother for that woman?"

"Sebastian," Liam called coldly. "Escort them out."

Margaret's eyes hardened. "You'll regret this, Liam."

###Chapter 205

Margaret Winslow was forcibly escorted out by Sebastian Montgomery and his security team.

At the entrance, Olivia Sinclair spotted her bodyguards—the ones she had sent to retrieve Richard Winslow—standing battered and bruised. Liam Blackwood had made his position crystal clear.

Margaret trembled with fury. "What is Liam thinking? Attacking my men?"

Sebastian maintained a polite yet icy tone. "Madam, you must understand. Mr. Blackwood has been under immense pressure lately. Exhaustion has made him short-tempered. It would be best if you refrained from visiting. His displeasure could easily become yours."

Margaret's rage flared. "I am his mother. Am I to be banned from my own son's home? Is that scheming Olivia turning him against me? I always knew she was bad luck. She's poisoned his mind."

Sebastian's smile thinned. "By the way, Mr. Blackwood asked me to relay a message. If you continue to harass his wife or harm her again, he expects you to return the heirlooms you took from her."

Margaret's anger flickered, though her jaw remained clenched. "What nonsense is this? Those belong to the Blackwood family. Olivia is an outsider. She has no right to them!"

Sebastian cleared his throat. "Those were specifically bequeathed to her by Mr. Henry Winslow in his will, legally witnessed. She never intended them to stay with you permanently. It was merely a temporary arrangement. She retains the right to reclaim them at any time."

Margaret was on the verge of losing her composure. "Everything I've done has been for the Blackwood family—especially for Liam. Will he truly not regret treating me this way?"

Sebastian suppressed a sarcastic retort. "Madam, these aren't Mr. Blackwood's exact words, but as his assistant, I must speak on his behalf. You always favored Richard as the heir. Yet, it was Mr. Henry Winslow who chose Liam as his successor, and you had no choice but to accept. You took valuables from Liam's wife, yet not a single penny went to him. Isn't it hypocritical to claim now that it was all for his benefit?"

He held back sharper words. The disparity in how Margaret treated her sons had always been obvious.

Conventional wisdom said mothers favored their youngest, but Margaret was an exception.

Perhaps her strained relationship with Liam stemmed from complications during his birth, or perhaps deeper reasons were at play.

One thing was certain—Margaret had never genuinely warmed to him.

Raised primarily by Henry, Liam's bond with his mother had only grown colder over time.

Her interest in him seemed purely transactional—his talent and position as heir made him useful.

Richard and Catherine Winslow's wedding had been a lavish affair, despite Margaret's reservations about Catherine. Still, she attended, signaling her approval.

In stark contrast, Olivia and Liam had skipped a formal ceremony entirely, earning nothing but disdain from Margaret.

Outwardly, she blamed Olivia, but everyone knew her resentment ran deeper.

At a loss, Margaret finally spat out, "Liam had better not regret this. I'm still his mother. His actions have truly disappointed me."

With that, she stormed off.

Sebastian only turned back once she was gone.

Inside her car, Margaret muttered under her breath, "An ungrateful son, cutting ties with his own mother over a woman. I should have never given birth to him."

The butler, attempting to soothe her, ventured carefully, "Madam, Mr. Blackwood is simply being immature. He doesn't understand your sacrifices."

"Forget it." Margaret exhaled sharply. "I can't rely on him. He has no patience—not for me, and certainly not for Richard. Given his attitude, I need to reconsider my options."

Glancing out the window, the butler lowered his voice. "Madam, Richard has been by your side since childhood. His loyalty is unwavering. Perhaps it's time to make a decision. If necessary, sever ties with Liam and let Richard take over. Your future would be more secure. From what I've heard, Liam is currently overwhelmed—health issues, business troubles. This might be the perfect opportunity."

Margaret rubbed her temples, hesitating. "But Liam has a gift for making money. Let's delay any decisions for now. I don't want to burden Richard too soon."

"Very well," the butler replied, though his tone carried resignation. He gave her a meaningful look before stepping out at her request.

Meanwhile, Olivia sat trapped in Liam's car, oblivious to the confrontation outside. Anxiety gnawed at her as she waited.

When the door finally opened, she flinched. Seeing Sebastian did little to calm her.

Tears streamed down Olivia's face as she typed frantically on her phone. "Liam promised! He swore he wouldn't harm my baby. I've done everything he asked without complaint. Why is he doing this?"

Sebastian softened at her distress. "Madam, please, calm down. You're pregnant. Mr. Blackwood means no harm. This was all for his mother's benefit."

Olivia remembered Liam's icy glare and shuddered. She shook her head vehemently. "I don't trust him—or you. I need to leave."

Sebastian hesitated. "Madam, I assure you, we would never endanger your child. Mr. Blackwood is dealing with his own struggles. One day, you'll understand."

In the past, Olivia might have relented, trying to see things from Liam's perspective.

But not anymore. She had learned to prioritize herself.

Determination flashed in her eyes as she demanded a lawyer. She wanted a divorce—she refused to stay, no matter Liam's reasons.

Sebastian was taken aback but realized Olivia's ignorance of Liam's circumstances justified her fear.

After repeated assurances, Olivia finally relaxed slightly as they returned to Liam's villa.

Inside, Liam sat at the dining table, eating as if nothing had happened.

When their eyes met, Olivia offered only a cold, dismissive glance before looking away.

###Chapter 206

Liam appeared composed on the surface, but the moment Olivia turned her back, his fingers dug into his knees with barely concealed tension.

A flicker of sorrow passed through Olivia's usually frosty gaze before she walked away.

Sebastian watched the silent exchange between them. Two people who clearly cared for each other, yet trapped in a labyrinth of unspoken words and misunderstandings.

Yet, Sebastian couldn't reveal the truth. Telling Liam that the child Olivia carried was his would only provoke him into reckless action. Sometimes, deception was necessary—even if it meant deceiving Liam first.

After Olivia disappeared upstairs, Liam pushed his plate away, appetite gone. He gestured to Sebastian. "Have the kitchen prepare something for her. She forgets to eat when she's upset. Tell her she's not leaving her room until she finishes a proper meal."

Sebastian hesitated. "And if she insists on cooking for herself?"

Liam's response was indifferent. "Let her. As long as she eats and rests properly. Monitor her daily routine and report anything unusual directly to me."

Just as Liam finished speaking, Sebastian's phone rang sharply.

Without delay, Sebastian answered. The moment he processed the words on the other end, his expression darkened. "Mr. Blackwood, there's been an accident. Your mother—"

Margaret had been involved in a car crash while descending the mountain.

Liam preferred solitude, living in a secluded villa nestled in the mountains outside the city.

The winding mountain road, though treacherous, was well-maintained and generally safe.

According to reports, Margaret, feeling unwell, had insisted on driving herself. The brakes had failed.

Now she lay in Mercy Hospital, condition unknown, with the police investigating.

The news unsettled Liam. Despite everything, Margaret was still his mother.

A gnawing suspicion took root in his mind. This didn't feel like an accident. Even if the investigation cleared him, his enemies would seize this opportunity to destroy him.

Seeing Liam's troubled expression, Sebastian suggested, "Mr. Blackwood, perhaps we should announce that you've been bedridden these past few days? That way, if they try to implicate you, there won't be any evidence to support their accusations."

Liam exhaled slowly, voice low. "That’s exactly what the mastermind would want me to do."

He was trapped in a dilemma. Margaret's accident seemed too convenient. But who would dare orchestrate such a thing? Someone with considerable power—or someone within the Blackwood family. Could Richard be involved?

A chill ran down Liam's spine at the thought. Margaret was their mother. And she had always treated Richard with kindness. He prayed it was just his imagination.

In the VIP ward of Mercy Hospital, Margaret had undergone resuscitation for the third time.

The doctor assured them she was stable now but required close monitoring.

Richard stood motionless, barely reacting even as the doctor called his name repeatedly.

When he finally registered that Margaret was out of danger, a flicker of disappointment crossed his face. Still, he asked cautiously, "Any risk of memory loss?"

The doctor, noting Richard's furrowed brow, spoke calmly. "No need for concern. In an accident this severe, a head injury would have been fatal. The real challenge now is her recovery. Without proper care, she could face permanent disabilities."

Richard waved him off impatiently. "Understood."

The doctor eyed him warily. Richard's behavior was odd. His mother had nearly died, yet he seemed disturbingly composed.

Seizing a moment alone, Richard slipped into the stairwell, where a gaunt man in a tailored suit waited.

A grotesque scar twisted across half the man's face, distorting his mouth into a sinister half-smile that unsettled even the bravest souls. His presence in the dimly lit stairwell was unnerving.

Richard approached, voice tight with desperation. "She survived. The doctor says she won’t lose her memory. What happens when she wakes up and names me?"

The man smirked, amused by Richard's panic. "A little late for regrets, don’t you think?"

Richard's irritation flared. "You're the one who pushed me into this. If I go down, you're coming with me!"

The man remained unfazed, lighting a cigarette before turning to face Richard. His unscarred left profile was strikingly handsome, but his hollow cheeks and cold eyes gave him an eerie aura.

He exhaled smoke slowly. "I warned you. High risk, high reward. You chose this path. I merely advised. Whether I'm caught means nothing to me—I have nothing to lose. But you? A Blackwood heir? You can't afford to fall."

Richard's anger warred with fear. Yet he knew this man was his only ally now.

Swallowing his pride, Richard muttered, "Fine. Just tell me what to do next. The reward is yours. I keep my word."

The man's twisted smile widened. "Stick to the plan. If all goes well, you'll soon be Margaret's only son. Didn’t the doctor mention her likely disability? Bedridden, dependent—she’ll have no one but you. After that..."

He left the rest unsaid, but Richard understood perfectly.

The plan was ruthless, but he saw no other choice. His expression hardened. "Consider it done."

Relieved, Richard's mood lifted. He regarded the man with newfound respect. "I used to think you were just a brute. But you’re sharper than I gave you credit for. Keep working with me. It’ll be worth your while."

He clapped the man on the shoulder before turning to leave.

As Richard disappeared, the man's eyes glinted with icy disdain.
###Chapter 207

The moment Richard Winslow left, a woman dressed in nurse's scrubs slipped into the stairwell. She approached the man with practiced deference. "Mr. Blackwood, everything is prepared."

Victor Blackwood gave a curt nod. "I never trusted Richard to handle anything competently. If not for needing him to infiltrate the Blackwood family, I wouldn't have associated with such mediocrity."

The woman smirked. "Richard still struts around giving orders like he's in charge. Does he truly believe anyone would follow a man like him? Mr. Blackwood, your intellect eclipses even Liam's. Why should someone of your caliber remain in the shadows? The injustices you've endured are unforgivable."

Victor's lips curved into a smile that didn't reach his cold eyes. "Precisely. Why? We're all heirs to the Blackwood legacy. Does my birth status make me unworthy? The humiliations Margaret inflicted upon my mother and me will never be forgotten. Having clawed my way this far, I intend to claim everything that's rightfully mine."

His scarred hand lifted to caress the woman's cheek tenderly. "You had a brilliant medical career ahead of you. Do you regret throwing it away for me?"

The woman gazed at him with unwavering devotion, seemingly oblivious to the severe disfigurement marring half his face. "Every sacrifice is worth it when I'm with you. In this entire world, only we truly understand each other."

A shadow crossed Victor's expression. "Once I secure everything, I'll make you my wife. For now, focus on perfecting the drug. Liam won't go down easily. The last batch showed some effect, but he's still too... resilient. If direct confrontation proves difficult, target the woman he cherishes most. She's our leverage."

"Understood." The woman traced his fingers with her own. "I'm with you until the end."

A sharp knock at the door shattered their moment.

Victor immediately pushed her aside. "We have company."

The door swung open to reveal Catherine Winslow.

The female doctor eyed Catherine with a mixture of disdain and wariness.

Victor cleared his throat. "Leave us."

After a lingering glance, the woman exited, closing the door softly behind her.

Catherine crossed her arms. "Next time, don't exclude me from your discussions. You wouldn't have connected with Richard without my help. When our plans succeed, remember who paved your way."

Victor's smile didn't reach his eyes. "Your contributions won't be forgotten."

"Don't patronize me." Catherine's voice turned icy. "If Richard weren't such a despicable man, I'd have divorced him years ago."

After catching Richard's infidelity, he'd only grown bolder, even bringing mistresses into their home. When Catherine confronted Margaret, the older woman had scoffed, "Why bother me? You're the one who failed to produce a son. No wonder my son seeks companionship elsewhere."

Catherine's divorce demands were met with Richard's ultimatum: leave without a cent since she'd borne no male heir. With her family's support waning, Catherine realized her survival depended on outside alliances.

Many were plotting against Liam. If he fell, Richard would inherit the Blackwood fortune. This needed to happen before Richard's mistresses bore children. Catherine planned to use this as leverage to claim half the family assets in her divorce.

Her unlikely ally? A long-forgotten illegitimate Blackwood heir. United by shared grievances, they formed an uneasy pact.

Though Victor's appearance repulsed her, Catherine would endure anything to achieve her goals. The fates of Richard and Margaret meant nothing to her.

"I didn't come to discuss that." Catherine's voice dropped as her expression darkened. "I conspired with a doctor to deceive Liam. The child Olivia carries is his. He remains unaware. I don't know why Liam keeps Olivia close, but given time, he'll discover the truth. If Liam has an heir, our plans become infinitely more complicated."

Her gaze locked onto Victor.

After a weighted silence, Victor chuckled darkly. "You want me to handle it?"

Catherine's tone turned glacial. "Even if Liam discovers my deception, he'll merely reprimand me. I can flee overseas with my daughter. But for you... the consequences would be far more severe."

Victor maintained his smile though his eyes turned arctic. He knew Catherine's warning held truth. Once Liam uncovered their schemes, controlling the situation would become impossible.

"Simple. We'll arrange an 'accident.' For someone as active as Olivia, mishaps are hardly unexpected."

Relief washed over Catherine's features. "Then I'll await your success."

Tomorrow marked the anniversary of Henry Winslow's death. The thought sent a pang through Olivia. In previous years, she and Liam had always visited the gravesite together to pay respects.

Lost in thought, Olivia eventually made her way to Liam's study and knocked.

Liam, usually at Blackwood Enterprises, was home today.

Olivia believed maintaining their tradition was important. Her intentions were pure—Henry had been a revered figure for them both.

Hearing no response, Olivia gently pushed the door open.

Her gaze swept the room before landing on Liam asleep on the study's single bed, still dressed in his now-wrinkled suit. One arm was flung over his eyes, the very picture of exhaustion.
###Chapter 208

Olivia rarely saw Liam in such a state. The man who always carried himself with icy elegance now appeared utterly drained.

Though she told herself not to care, her hands moved instinctively when she saw him slumped over his desk.

Spotting a cashmere throw on the nearby sofa, Olivia draped it carefully over Liam's shoulders.

Her fingers barely brushed his jacket when an iron grip seized her wrist.

Olivia gasped as she met piercing blue eyes that burned with unexpected intensity.

Liam blinked in recognition before releasing her. "What are you doing here?" His voice sounded raw.

Rubbing her wrist, Olivia reached for her phone. [Evelyn isn't available. You seemed unwell. Should I call her?]

A bitter smile twisted Liam's lips. "How thoughtful of my wife to arrange meetings with my mistress. When did you become so accommodating?"

Olivia ignored the barb, attributing it to his exhaustion.

She moved to an armchair and sat with perfect posture, her expression carefully blank.

Liam's tone softened. "What is it?"

Olivia typed quickly. [Tomorrow is Henry's anniversary. We should visit as usual.]

Liam studied her face but remained silent.

[If you'd prefer to go separately, I understand,] she added.

Rubbing his temples, Liam sighed. "I can't go tomorrow. Make whatever arrangements you need with Sebastian. I need to rest."

Olivia stood reluctantly. At the door, she hesitated. [You've never missed this before. Why this year?]

Liam's gaze didn't waver. "Evelyn has an awards ceremony."

Olivia's chest tightened. She wanted to scream - was some trophy presentation more important than honoring his grandfather?

But she swallowed the words. Liam's choices were no longer her concern. She only hoped he wouldn't regret them.

The disappointment in Olivia's eyes didn't escape Liam. As she walked away, he opened his mouth, then closed it. The moment for explanations had passed. She probably thought him heartless.

With a humorless chuckle, Liam called Sebastian.

"Tell Evelyn an urgent meeting came up. I'll make dinner tomorrow night, but can't attend her ceremony." He paused. "And Sebastian? Don't mention the cemetery visit. I need time alone."

Sebastian sounded surprised. "Your wife already said she expected to go alone. She only needed logistical help."

"Just handle it," Liam snapped, his headache worsening.

"Of course, Mr. Blackwood. Though the forecast predicts heavy rain tomorrow. Perhaps postpone? The mountain roads become dangerous when wet. I've warned your wife."

Liam's grip tightened on the phone. "What did she say?"

"She insists on going. Promises to make it quick."

A long silence. "Ensure her safety."

The next morning, Olivia left early to beat the storm.

But the rain arrived ahead of schedule.

As her car climbed the winding road, fat drops began splattering the windshield. The private cemetery Liam had chosen for Henry sat isolated on this remote mountainside.

Olivia watched the rain streak the glass. Soon, she might be the only one visiting Henry's grave. The thought twisted her heart. If something happened to her, who would remember him?

"Madam," the driver cautioned as she stepped out, "the storm will worsen. Please hurry."

Olivia nodded, typing: [I won't be long.]

Umbrella in hand, she walked into the downpour.

As she neared the grave, a figure in black caught her attention. The man stood unnaturally still, clearly not a mourner. Who besides family would visit Henry's resting place?

Distracted, Olivia slipped on the wet grass.

Strong arms caught her before she fell, as if the stranger had anticipated her misstep.

[Thank you,] Olivia typed, breathless.

"You're welcome," came the calm reply.

When Olivia looked up, she couldn't hide her shock. The right side of the man's face bore terrible scarring.

Noticing her reaction, Olivia quickly averted her gaze.

Victor only smiled. "Don't apologize. Everyone reacts that way at first."

Feeling ashamed, Olivia typed: [Outer appearances mean nothing. Your kindness speaks volumes.]

Victor's smile deepened, his good eye glinting strangely. "You're too kind."

Curiosity overcame Olivia. Though the unscarred side of his face looked vaguely familiar, she couldn't place him.

"I'm Victor Blackwood," he said smoothly. "A... distant relative. It's natural you wouldn't recognize me."

Olivia's fingers flew across her phone. [From the other branch of the family?]

Victor's smile didn't reach his eyes as the rain fell harder around them.
###Chapter 209

Victor Blackwood stood frozen for a heartbeat before his piercing gaze locked onto Olivia Sinclair.

Though he remained silent and motionless, Olivia felt an icy sweat break out across her skin under his intense scrutiny.

"Something wrong? Don't I remind you of anyone from the Blackwood family?" Victor's voice was deceptively calm as he stepped closer.

Olivia met his stare. She blinked, uncertain if her mind was playing tricks - she suddenly saw a startling resemblance to Liam in his features. The likeness would have been even more pronounced if not for the scars marring half of Victor's face.

Thinking she'd accidentally offended him, Olivia hastily typed out an explanation. "Though I've been with the Blackwoods since childhood, I mostly stayed with Henry and rarely socialized. I don't know much about you. My apologies if I've caused offense."

But Victor's smile twisted strangely. "No need. It's understandable. After all, I'm just the hidden bastard son. My existence is an embarrassment, unwelcome in the grand halls of the Blackwood estate."

Olivia's eyes widened in shock. A secret illegitimate child? Since when did the Blackwoods have one?

Victor watched her reaction with dark amusement. "Surprised, Olivia? Your husband Liam has known about me for years. Yet he's always looked down on me. Technically, you're my sister-in-law." He leaned closer. "I know you're having... difficulties with Liam right now. Why not work together? Give me what I need, and I'll help you settle scores with Liam and Evelyn. What do you say?"

With each word, Olivia's unease grew. She instinctively stepped back, putting distance between them. Everything about Victor screamed danger.

A chill had run down her spine the moment she'd first seen him.

Earlier confusion suddenly crystallized into terrifying clarity.

Shaking her head, Olivia typed firmly: "There's no bad blood between Liam and me. You've mistaken me for someone else."

She turned to leave.

But before she could take three steps, Victor seized her wrist. "Oh, you're exactly who I've been searching for. And you're not going anywhere."

His words sent ice through her veins. She turned back to see a sinister grin spreading across his scarred face.

By the time Liam reached the mountain's base, the rain had intensified into a pounding deluge.

Worry for Olivia gnawed at him, making his pulse race. If Richard hadn't unexpectedly cornered him this morning to discuss Margaret's situation, he wouldn't have been delayed. Now he had no idea what danger Olivia might be facing.

Even though this was Blackwood property, Liam's anxiety spiked with every moment Olivia remained out of sight.

The car jerked to an abrupt stop.

Sebastian, their driver, leapt into the downpour to assess the road ahead.

Five minutes later, he returned with a troubled expression. "Unfamiliar vehicles blocking the path ahead. Definitely not Blackwood cars," he reported.

Liam's scowl deepened. "Not ours? What's happening? I made it clear all visitors needed prior approval."

Equally confused, Sebastian said, "I'll contact the owners to move them immediately."

Impatience burning through him, Liam threw open the car door to continue on foot.

Still on the phone, Sebastian grew alarmed. "Mr. Blackwood, please! The doctors stressed you must conserve your strength before surgery."

Liam's voice turned glacial. "Can't you see this is no coincidence, Sebastian?"

Sebastian fell silent.

The timing was too perfect.

With Henry's death anniversary approaching, Liam had noticed increasing surveillance on his movements.

That's why he'd sent extra guards with Olivia instead of accompanying her himself. Guards who had mysteriously vanished.

As Liam pushed forward, another blocked road confirmed his suspicions. Who would dare this on Blackwood land?

Suddenly, realization struck Sebastian. His face paled.

Liam's lips curled into a mirthless smile. "Richard. I always knew he envied my position, but I never thought he'd go this far. Olivia's innocent in this. My fault for not seeing his hand sooner."

Yet even as suspicion pointed to Richard, unease prickled Liam's neck.

Richard was ambitious but lacked the sophistication for this. Someone far more cunning was pulling strings behind the scenes.

Dread rising, Liam shook off Sebastian's restraining hand. "I'm going up that mountain now. Olivia's in danger."

Reluctantly, Sebastian followed.

The strategically placed vehicles confirmed this was a deliberate obstruction. Normally, security patrols would be everywhere on Blackwood land. Their absence suggested they'd been neutralized.

The realization made Liam's blood run cold.

Meanwhile, Olivia slowly regained consciousness in a rustic cabin, the crackling fire the only sound. Her eyelids felt leaden as she struggled to open them, her body weak and disoriented.

Memories slipped through her fingers like smoke.

"Awake?" A male voice startled her.

Olivia's gaze focused on Victor's menacing face, and everything came rushing back.

After his shocking revelation, Victor had attacked. Despite her struggles, he'd overpowered her and brought her here.

Terror gripped Olivia as realization dawned. Her hands instinctively cradled her stomach.

Victor's gaze dropped to her abdomen, his smile unsettling. "Don't fear. I know about the baby. I won't harm you. Stay calm."

His gentle tone only heightened her dread.
###Chapter 210

Olivia clenched her jaw, the exhaustion weighing heavy in her limbs. Yet she noted with surprise that Victor hadn't restrained her. Her phone lay untouched within reach.

Victor lounged casually in his chair, radiating smug assurance that escape was impossible for her.

Olivia dismissed any thought of calling authorities. The cold calculation in Victor's eyes told her any cry for help would be pointless.

Her fingers flew across the screen. "What do you want? Why target me and my baby?"

Victor's lips curled as he read the message. He shifted closer, the couch dipping under his weight.

Olivia's breath hitched when his thigh brushed against hers.

"Didn't I say?" Victor's hand landed on her shoulder, making her skin crawl. "You're family now. Why would I hurt my dear sister-in-law?"

Olivia dug her nails into her palm, the sharp pain grounding her. She typed with trembling fingers. "Get to the point."

Victor's fingers traced her jawline.

"My brothers live like kings with their perfect wives." His breath smelled of mint and something darker. "A mute with fire in her eyes - we're two of a kind, you and I. Join me. Together we'll make them pay."

Olivia recoiled. The Winslows had raised her. Even after everything, she owed them that much.

Shirley and Catherine had crossed lines, but vengeance wasn't in Olivia's nature. Everyone walked their own path. If they came for her after she left, she'd defend herself - but she wouldn't hunt them.

Her head shook in firm refusal.

Victor's pleasant mask shattered. "After everything they've done?" He slammed his fist on the table. "No wonder they walk all over you. Pathetic."

Olivia's fingers moved with determination. "My choices are mine. If you won't harm me, let me go. Using me against Liam won't work - I mean nothing to him."

Victor's gaze dropped to her swollen belly. "Maybe. But that child carries Blackwood blood. When I end Liam, do you think I'll let his spawn live?"

Olivia's throat closed. Her fingers became a blur on the screen. "Liam doesn't want this baby! The child is innocent! Kill us both and Evelyn will just give him more heirs. Your quarrel isn't with me. I'll disappear - take the baby overseas forever if that's what it takes."

The door burst open.

A woman in a lab coat strode in. Miranda Graves' beauty couldn't mask the cruelty in her ice-chip eyes. Her stare made Olivia's skin prickle.

Seeing Victor so close to Olivia, Miranda's lips twisted. "Mr. Blackwood, why waste time? The injection's ready. One dose and not even God could save that bastard's child. Liam's men are closing in - we need to move."

Victor ignored her, his attention fixed on Olivia.

Miranda's jealousy flared at his focus on the trembling mute. She crossed the room in three strides and backhanded Olivia across the face. "Stop your pathetic simpering, you scheming little-"

Victor was on his feet in an instant. "What the hell?"

Miranda pouted. "She's playing you with those doe eyes. Don't fall for it."

Victor snatched the syringe from her hand.

Olivia's blood turned to ice as brown liquid dribbled from the needle.

Her fingers closed around a loose brick behind her back. For her baby, she'd fight.

Then Victor tossed the syringe aside. "Change of plans. The pregnancy continues."

Miranda's protest died at Victor's glare. He'd never raised his voice to her before. This mute bitch had bewitched him.

Olivia exhaled slowly, meeting Victor's gaze with wary hope.

Victor's smile turned serpentine. "Let's make it interesting. Message Liam. Tell him you're with me. If he comes, you walk free. If not..." His fingers brushed her cheek. "You're mine. Don't worry - I'll keep you safe. Just insurance against Liam. When he fails, you and the baby can go."

Olivia didn't believe a word. The thought of contacting Liam made her stomach churn. Today was his awards gala with Evelyn.

Her message was brief: "Kidnapped. Mountain villa. Liam, please come."

Victor watched her hit send, satisfaction oozing from every pore as he settled back to wait.

Meanwhile, Liam paused mid-stride up the mountain path when his phone buzzed.

Sebastian peeked over his shoulder. "Sir! We have Mrs. Blackwood's location! I'll dispatch a team immediately!"

Liam's hand shot out. "No. That message wasn't voluntary. This is a test - they want to see how much I value her."

Sebastian hesitated. "The extraction team, sir?"

Liam's eyes glittered like Arctic frost. "Naturally. Let's see who dares play games in my territory."

Back in the villa, Olivia stared at her silent phone. Ten minutes. No response. Her nails bit bloody crescents into her palms.
###Chapter 211

Victor Blackwood's expression darkened at the unexpected revelation. "I'm aware of your complicated history with Liam. Childhood sweethearts who grew up together. Yet despite Evelyn now holding his heart, I sense lingering emotions on his part. His complete indifference to your current situation... it baffles me."

Exhausted, Olivia Sinclair stopped trying to determine whether Victor was mocking her or testing her resolve.

Her fingers danced across the phone screen as she typed her response. "Evelyn was Liam's first and deepest love. Had I not entered the picture, they would have married years ago. Evelyn once confessed that Liam planned to elope with her overseas to avoid our wedding, until Henry Winslow intervened. Even now, Liam suspects I was the one who exposed their plans."

The memory of Evelyn's bitter expression as she shared this story remained vivid in Olivia's mind. There had been an undercurrent of smug satisfaction in Evelyn's voice that day.

This revelation had come shortly after Olivia's wedding, when she'd been blissfully unaware of the turmoil beneath the surface or Liam's deep resentment toward their arranged marriage.

Feeling like an outsider in her own marriage, Olivia had confronted Liam directly.

His response had been cold and dismissive. "Why concern yourself with ancient history? None of this matters to you."

While Liam neither confirmed nor denied Evelyn's claims, his tone spoke volumes.

Now, watching Liam's behavior around Evelyn, Olivia found herself believing every word of Evelyn's story.

Victor appeared genuinely shocked by this disclosure. A dangerous glint appeared in his eyes.

"Who would have guessed my half-brother remains so obsessed with that woman," Victor mused aloud.

Then he flashed Olivia a knowing smile. "Yet something doesn't sit right with me."

With those words, Victor snatched Olivia's phone from her grasp, forcing her to unlock it.

Liam's contact information appeared immediately in Olivia's phone directory.

Truth be told, Olivia had changed phones multiple times, but Liam always insisted on being the first to program his number into each new device.

Before their marriage, Liam would declare arrogantly, "If you need anything, call me. You don't need other men's numbers. Those college boys are useless. You're too naive - I won't have them taking advantage of you."

After their wedding, his tone shifted slightly. "Call me if there's trouble. I don't want to waste time tracking you down if something happens. It's too inconvenient."

As Victor began dialing Liam's number, panic surged through Olivia. The thought of hearing those painful words again filled her with dread. She'd rather Liam ignored her messages completely, maintaining his usual indifference.

Desperate, Olivia lunged for her phone.

Victor easily dodged her grasp, sneering, "Why so nervous? Afraid of what I might discover?"

Before Olivia's fingers could brush the device, Liam's detached voice came through the speaker. "What is it?" His question was clipped.

Olivia's throat tightened. So he'd been near his phone. It had rung barely twice before he answered.

When Olivia remained silent, Liam's impatience grew audible. "If you have something to say, say it. I need to go backstage for Evelyn's award ceremony."

Victor glanced at Olivia, whose eyes brimmed with unshed tears, then signaled to Miranda.

Miranda immediately brought over a hulking man with a menacing expression.

Just as Liam was about to hang up, the brute interjected sharply, "Liam Blackwood? I have your wife. You have thirty minutes to arrive at the location I'm sending, or face the consequences."

Silence stretched on the line.

Though Olivia held no real hope, her heart pounded during those quiet moments.

Suddenly, Liam's icy chuckle crackled through. "What? Planning to kill her? Be my guest. Olivia, I never expected you to stage a kidnapping just to get my attention. You know how important today's ceremony is to Evelyn, yet you choose to disrupt it. You've truly disappointed me."

Olivia closed her eyes. Liam's response was exactly what she'd anticipated. So why did her heart still shatter?

Victor grinned triumphantly, motioning for the brute to end the call.

When Victor looked at Olivia again, his gaze held unexpected sympathy. "I thought you and Liam were playing some elaborate game to deceive me. Clearly, I underestimated how heartless my brother could be. Years of marriage, and he cares nothing for you."

Olivia's face remained impassive, offering no reply.

Victor stood, signaling his men to take Olivia away. "You've lost our little wager, Olivia. If you must blame someone, blame Liam - not me. Remember, he's the one who abandoned you."

Meanwhile, Liam stared at his phone, fighting the urge to call back. He hurled the device aside, clenched his fists, and punched the wall with enough force to crack the plaster.

Sebastian Montgomery, alarmed by Liam's uncharacteristic violence, urgently pressed the tech team. "Status report? Have you located her yet?"

"The call was brief, but we got what we needed."

Liam regained his composure, his voice glacial. "If you can't find that location, consider yourselves unemployed."

Five minutes later came the breakthrough. Olivia's location had been pinpointed to an abandoned residential complex in the neighboring hills.

Liam immediately mobilized his security team.

Sebastian intervened. "Mr. Blackwood, please reconsider - this could be a trap."

Liam's expression remained steel. "No matter the risk, I'm ending this today."

Elsewhere, after Olivia had been bound and placed in a vehicle, Miranda returned to Victor, visibly frustrated. "Mr. Blackwood, I don't understand your leniency with her. She's nothing but a schemer who manipulated that senile old man into letting her stay with the Blackwoods. That fool preferred her over welcoming you home. Doesn't that infuriate you?"

"What does that matter now?" Victor reclined with closed eyes, a sardonic smile playing on his lips. "Breaking Liam is what truly matters. Miranda, I've told you - she's carrying Liam's heir. Control yourself."

Miranda remained unconvinced. "But you heard his reaction yourself! Liam clearly cares only for Evelyn. Why waste resources on Olivia? Evelyn and Liam are young - children would come naturally in time."

Victor's eyes snapped open, pinning Miranda with an intense stare. "Evelyn will never bear children."

His casual statement sent chills down Miranda's spine.

Seeing Victor's resolute expression, Miranda realized this wasn't idle speculation. She fell silent.

Victor continued, "Therefore, Olivia's unborn child becomes our most valuable bargaining chip. Her safety and that baby's delivery must be ensured at all costs."
###Chapter 212

Olivia pressed her lips together, the resistance to Victor's words written clearly across her face. Somewhere in her heart, she recognized the cold logic behind his reasoning.

When Victor had first involved Catherine in his schemes, Olivia had merely felt mild irritation.

But this time, his unexpected tenderness toward Olivia Sinclair stirred something darker within her.

Victor was known for his ruthless demeanor. Yet the way he softened around Olivia spoke volumes. His interest was undeniable.

Unaware of the storm brewing in Olivia's eyes, Victor simply waved her off. "Take her back first," he ordered.

Olivia's brows shot up. "You're not coming with us?"

Victor's smirk was razor-sharp. "When Liam regains his senses, he'll realize the truth in Olivia's messages. Liam Blackwood, raised to value control above all as the Winslow heir, might pretend indifference toward his wife, but their marriage bond remains. Someone daring to snatch his wife? That's a direct challenge. He'll come for me. We'll split our forces—you take Olivia discreetly. That should throw him off track."

Understanding dawned on Olivia as she nodded, anxiety tightening her throat. "Liam isn't someone to underestimate."

Victor's smile was reassuring. "Don't worry about me. Just keep Olivia safe. Nothing can happen to her."

"You care too much about her," Olivia muttered, unable to mask her displeasure.

Victor closed his eyes and remained silent.

Victor's prediction proved correct sooner than expected.

Though he'd blocked one route intentionally, multiple winding paths remained open.

Victor's men chose the widest trail down the mountain—only to be ambushed within minutes.

Sebastian and his team overpowered Victor's men effortlessly, but a thorough search of every vehicle yielded no trace of Olivia.

Meanwhile, Olivia was leading Olivia Sinclair through dense woodland.

There was actually a drivable road on this side, but Olivia deliberately chose the harder path.

Olivia Sinclair, already weakened from earlier shocks, grew paler with each stumbling step.

Seeing her fragility only fueled Olivia's resentment.

"Who are you performing for?" Olivia sneered. "Always playing the victim. Pathetic!"

Olivia Sinclair ignored the venom in her voice. She pulled free from Olivia's grip and found a moss-covered rock to sit on.

She knew Victor had no intention of killing her. As his subordinate, Olivia wouldn't dare disobey.

This realization made Olivia flush with anger. "Don't forget, I'm a doctor. I won't harm you or your baby, but I can make this very unpleasant."

Olivia Sinclair studied her with quiet curiosity before typing on her phone: "You love him, don't you? Why? He's clearly using you."

Olivia's smile froze. Rage flashed in her eyes. "Shut your mouth! You have no right—"

Olivia Sinclair typed faster: "No need for anger. His manipulation is obvious. I'm just saying—don't sacrifice everything for a man's fleeting attention. You're brilliant. Why waste yourself on someone who'll never love you?"

"ENOUGH!" Olivia screamed.

She snatched the phone and smashed it against a tree. "You pathetic mute! Just because you couldn't keep a man doesn't mean all women fail like you!"

Watching Olivia unravel, Olivia Sinclair felt a pang of sorrow. Why chain yourself to hollow affection?

In another life, Olivia could've been remarkable—beautiful, brilliant, with that magnetic confidence. Without Victor's shadow, her future might have shone bright.

But some paths, once chosen, resist redirection.

Setting aside these thoughts, Olivia Sinclair felt a flicker of relief. Her provocation had worked.

She stole a glance at the shattered phone in the undergrowth. Even if Liam seemed indifferent, his pride wouldn't tolerate someone stealing his wife.

She was certain Liam would notice her absence soon. That broken phone might lead him here.

Olivia, now visibly agitated, yanked her upright. "Move! Now!" she barked, shoving her forward.

Olivia Sinclair bit her lip and complied, wary of Olivia's unstable temper.

When Sebastian reported the failed interception, Liam's expression turned glacial. Their adversary was shrewder than expected.

"Should we comb the mountain?" Sebastian asked.

"Unnecessary." Liam exhaled sharply. "If I've shown no concern for Olivia, sudden action would raise suspicion. Besides, if they wanted her dead, they'd have killed her already. This is a game. She's safe for now."

Sebastian saw the logic but hesitated. "Then why are you still heading up the mountain?"

Liam had reached the coordinates from Olivia's call. He stared at the unassuming cabin, his gaze turning lethal. "The puppet master wants an audience. How could I refuse?"

He kicked open the door to find a man murmuring prayers over a photograph of Henry Winslow, head bowed in apparent reverence.

Liam's voice cut like ice. "Drop the act. Who are you?"

Victor turned, feigning surprise. His mask was off. "Liam Blackwood in the flesh. Do I frighten you that much?"

Liam studied the scarred face—unfamiliar, yet somehow significant. "Do we know each other?"

Victor's smile vanished. He straightened slowly, eyes glinting dangerously. "Mr. Winslow, do I look like a demon crawled from hell? Ever consider how a careless remark years ago could destroy two innocent lives?"

Liam's confusion deepened. "You've mistaken me for someone else."

Victor lunged, gripping Liam's collar. "NO MISTAKE! I remember EVERY WORD!"

Seeing the madness in his eyes, Liam reacted instantly—his fist connecting with Victor's jaw.

Victor staggered back, panting like a cornered beast, his gaze burning with primal hatred.

###Chapter 213

Crimson droplets slid down Victor Blackwood's chin.

With deliberate precision, he wiped the blood away, his expression eerily calm despite the injury.

Liam Blackwood's obsidian eyes darkened. This madman was testing his limits.

"You're obsessed with some imagined past," Liam stated coldly. "But I'll ask once - are you truly foolish enough to challenge me while aligning with Richard? That's a death wish."

Victor's lips curled into a bone-chilling smile. "Richard may be incompetent, but you're the one who deserves annihilation. I'll use any means necessary to ensure your destruction."

Liam's temper flared, his voice dropping to dangerous levels. "You've mistaken my restraint for weakness. Take one step beyond that threshold, and I'll personally demonstrate how painfully you can die."

Victor remained unfazed, taunting, "Then show me this legendary Blackwood ruthlessness I've heard so much about."

In a flash of movement, Liam seized Victor by the collar, his superior height amplifying the threat.

Their gazes locked, and Liam saw the familiar resentment burning in Victor's eyes - the same envy he'd witnessed countless times from those coveting the Blackwood legacy.

Victor remembered watching Liam's televised speeches years ago. The media darling, blessed with everything - looks, intelligence, privilege.

Now facing him, Victor realized no camera could capture the raw commanding presence Liam exuded naturally.

Unlike Richard's forced arrogance, Liam carried himself with effortless authority.

The injustice burned through Victor's veins. Why must he scrape for survival while this man had everything handed to him?

Liam tightened his grip effortlessly, his cold eyes reflecting Victor's pathetic existence. "Final warning. Whatever grudge you carry, don't test me on my territory. Hand over Olivia now, or this becomes your last day breathing."

To Liam's surprise, Victor laughed - genuinely amused. "Underestimating me again, Mr. Blackwood? You've already ingested my special cocktail. Care to discover what else I've prepared?"

A sharp sting pierced Liam's finger. He glanced down to see a concealed needle protruding from Victor's collar.

Releasing his hold, Liam staggered back as sudden dizziness overwhelmed him.

The last thing he saw before darkness claimed him was Victor's triumphant smirk.

When consciousness returned, night had fallen. Sebastian Montgomery hovered nearby, relief washing over his features.

"Mr. Blackwood, going in alone was reckless," Sebastian fretted. "I couldn't risk moving you without medical clearance. We need full toxicology screening - who knows what he injected you with?"

Liam massaged his throbbing temples. "His location?"

Sebastian's expression darkened. "He vanished. My apologies."

Liam waved off the apology. "He's cunning. This hatred runs deeper than I realized. It changes the equation."

"I'll launch a full background investigation immediately," Sebastian vowed.

Liam shook his head. "Standard procedures won't suffice. Anyone willing to go this far won't be deterred easily. Start with Richard's connections - there's a thread there."

A knock interrupted them.

Security approached with tracking dogs, presenting a phone sealed in evidence plastic. "Found this on the western ridge, sir."

Liam recognized Olivia's device instantly. "Process it for prints and data recovery."

Meanwhile, Olivia stumbled down the mountain trail, her legs threatening to buckle.

A black sedan materialized before them. The window lowered to reveal Victor's assessing gaze - first evaluating Olivia's exhaustion, then flashing Miranda Graves a warning glare.

Miranda initially shrank under his disapproval, then defiantly shoved Olivia forward. "Get in."

Too drained to resist, Olivia complied.

When Miranda moved to follow, Victor commanded, "You ride separately."

Miranda's jaw clenched. "Then she comes with me."

Victor ignored her, offering Olivia water instead. "My apologies for the ordeal. Your husband proved... problematic. But handled."

Olivia's hands trembled slightly. What did "handled" mean? Had they fought? Was Liam injured?

She maintained her composure, nodding slightly.

Victor noted her microexpressions with satisfaction.

Suddenly, he reached toward her.

Olivia flinched, trapped in the confined space.

But Victor merely brushed a droplet from her lip. "You should take better care carrying my child."

Olivia's skin crawled. She turned away, avoiding his gaze.

Outside, Miranda seethed, fists clenching before storming off.

To Olivia's surprise, they arrived at an opulent gated compound far from the city.

As they passed through heavily armed checkpoints, a chilling realization settled over her - this fortress might become her permanent prison.

Victor honored his word regarding accommodations - a private villa within the complex, undisturbed except for one condition: Miranda would reside with her.

As Olivia's physician, Miranda could monitor her condition.

Before Olivia could object, Miranda protested, "I refuse. I'm not some nursemaid for spoiled heiresses."

Olivia typed rapidly, "I prefer solitude."

Victor observed their exchange silently, his glacial stare silencing further argument.
###Chapter 214

Olivia instantly recognized the danger flashing in Victor's piercing gaze.

Her chest tightened with injustice as she boldly stepped forward, grasping Victor's hand. "Mr. Blackwood," she whispered urgently, "For three years, I've devoted myself to you without fail. Not a single day have I—"

"Miranda Graves!" Victor's voice sliced through her words like a blade. "Need I remind you? Olivia Sinclair is vital to my plans. Her safety, and that of her unborn child, takes precedence."

Nearby, Olivia remained silent, understanding the hidden meaning behind Victor's declaration. At least she wasn't in immediate peril. Her shoulders relaxed slightly.

Tears streamed down Miranda's face, her usual composure shattered. Her nails dug crescent moons into her clenched palms.

Victor motioned Miranda closer, pulling her aside. "Must I explain again?" he murmured. "Have you forgotten your true purpose here?"

Miranda's eyes shimmered with unshed tears. "Never. My duty is to protect you—to keep you safe."

A heavy sigh escaped Victor's lips. "By safeguarding Olivia and her child, you're protecting me. Now that Liam knows, it's only a matter of time before he strikes. Olivia is our leverage. And that baby... is essential."

Confusion laced Miranda's voice. "But why must you be so... gentle with her?"

Victor lifted Miranda's hand, pressing a featherlight kiss to her knuckles.

A rosy blush spread across Miranda's cheeks, her lashes fluttering.

"Every kindness I show her is calculated," Victor murmured. "What I give you is genuine. Can't you tell the difference?"

Miranda's heart swelled—Victor always knew how to soothe her with just a few words.

"My apologies." Shame colored her voice. "My feelings for you overwhelm my judgment sometimes. Victor, don't worry. I'll watch over her properly."

Victor stroked her hair gently. "Rest now," he whispered.

As Miranda retreated, Victor's expression turned glacial, his eyes hardening into chips of ice.

A man approached cautiously. "Mr. Blackwood, forgive my intrusion, but Miranda's medical expertise is limited, especially in obstetrics. Her psychological history makes her unreliable. Is it wise to entrust Olivia to her care?"

Victor's smile held no warmth. "I never intended for her to succeed. When Liam discovers the truth, whatever befalls Olivia will be Miranda's doing. The blame will rest solely on her shoulders."

The man suppressed a shudder, though Victor's ruthlessness came as no surprise. He'd always been a master of emotional detachment.

"Sir," the man ventured carefully, "He's returning soon. You should prepare."

For the first time, genuine fear flickered across Victor's normally impassive face.

This was their shared secret—Victor's empire wasn't truly his. Everything belonged to the true monster lurking in the shadows.

Meanwhile, Liam maintained his usual routine, showing no outward concern for the search efforts.

Sebastian made no overt moves either.

Lately, Liam noticed increased surveillance—subtle but persistent. Whether corporate spies or family lackeys, their watchful eyes followed his every move.

One afternoon, Sebastian entered Liam's office with grim news. "Mr. Blackwood."

Exhaustion lined Liam's face as he set aside his documents. By day, he played the dutiful CEO with Evelyn; by night, he coordinated the relentless hunt for Olivia.

Sebastian's expression kindled hope. "Olivia? Have you—"

A strategic cough cut him off.

The door burst open, revealing Alexander Hayes, fury radiating from every pore.

Though they'd clashed before, Liam had never seen Alexander so unhinged—the famously controlled Hayes heir looked ready to murder.

Liam stood slowly, shadows darkening his features.

At the door, Sebastian exchanged worried glances with the alarmed secretaries.

"Leave us," Liam commanded. "I'll call if needed."

With a quiet sigh, Sebastian ushered everyone out, closing the door firmly.

"Liam," Alexander spat, voice trembling with rage. "First you demanded Olivia's return, holding Whitmore Holdings hostage. I tolerated that because of my own failures, and Olivia's misguided guilt. You promised to protect her. Now she's vanished, and you refuse to explain. If anything happens to her, her blood is on your hands. Do her accusing eyes haunt your dreams?"

Liam's fists clenched, then relaxed, frustration evident.

"I've told you—I wasn't there when it happened. We're still investigating." Liam's lie came smoothly. "This is a legal matter. What do you imagine happened? Money motivates everyone. Can't the mighty Whitmores handle a ransom demand?"

Alexander recoiled. "You wouldn't pay to save her? How can you be so heartless?"

Liam almost laughed at the irony. "Why should I? As her husband? Or the father of her child?"

Alexander missed the self-mockery, seeing only cruelty.

With a roar, Alexander grabbed Liam's collar. "When Olivia returns safely, I'll make sure she sees you for what you are! You're unworthy of her love!"

"Her love..." Liam repeated the words like foreign currency.

Instead of anger, curiosity colored Liam's response. "You believe she loves me?"

This only enraged Alexander further.

"What does she even see in you?" Alexander muttered.

Blind with fury, Alexander drew back his fist—
###Chapter 215

"Stop!" The command sliced through the air, sharp and authoritative, coming from the doorway.

Alexander recognized the voice instantly. His anger flared, but he forced himself to release Liam, though his grip loosened with visible reluctance.

William staggered inside, each cough shaking his frail frame, the sound cutting through the heavy silence like a blade. His distress was palpable.

Without hesitation, Liam dialed Sebastian, instructing him to attend to William immediately—a gesture of concern that Alexander met with a cold sneer.

"Pathetic hypocrisy," Alexander muttered under his breath.

William fixed him with a piercing stare. "I've spent years teaching you restraint, yet here you are, still as reckless as ever," he admonished, disappointment lacing his tone.

Alexander shot back, defiance burning in his eyes. "This isn't recklessness. It's justice. How can he treat Olivia like this? She's missing, for God's sake! I haven't slept in days, worrying myself sick. You feel the same, don't you, Grandfather? But him?" He jerked his chin toward Liam. "He's still her husband! He should be tearing the city apart looking for her, but he acts like she doesn't even matter!"

"Enough!" William's voice cracked like a whip, silencing the room.

Alexander clenched his jaw, turned sharply, and stormed out of Liam's office, slamming the door behind him.

Liam straightened his disheveled collar and met William's gaze with quiet respect. "William, I'm sorry you had to see that."

William stepped closer, lowering his voice. "Is Olivia safe?"

Liam exhaled heavily. "I don't know yet. But I can promise she's not in immediate danger."

William's shoulders sagged slightly, though his eyes remained sharp. "I understand you have your reasons for secrecy. I still believe you're a good man, Liam. But Olivia shouldn't suffer for your choices. Once she's found, the Whitmore family will ensure her protection. You need to let go."

Liam opened his mouth to argue, then hesitated. William was right. The danger Olivia faced was because of him. What right did he have to demand she stay?

Finally, he nodded. "I promise, William. I'll do everything I can to bring her back safely. This is my fault."

William gave his shoulder a firm squeeze. "Visit your mother at Mercy Hospital when you can. Whatever happened that night, it's weighing on you. Let me handle Olivia's situation. Brent—Alexander—will help. If you focus too much on this, you'll leave yourself vulnerable."

Liam understood the warning. Reluctantly, he nodded. "Thank you."

As William turned to leave, Liam called after him. "When Olivia is safe... ask her when she wants to finalize the divorce. She’s made her choice clear. I won’t hold her back any longer."

William didn’t respond, only sighed deeply before walking away.

Outside, Alexander was brushing off Sebastian’s attempts at diplomacy. "Your boss has time to send you to placate me but not to search for Olivia?"

Sebastian offered a polite smile. "Mr. Blackwood is overwhelmed, but I assure you, Mr. Hayes, the search hasn’t stopped. We will find her."

"When?" Alexander’s voice rose dangerously. "A year from now? Two?"

His frustration boiled over. "I can’t believe I ever trusted Liam! Even if their marriage is over, they grew up together. How can he just ignore her like this? It shows exactly what kind of man he is!"

Nearby employees glanced over, whispering.

Sebastian cleared his throat. "Mr. Hayes, perhaps we should discuss this privately—"

"Save it, Sebastian."

Evelyn’s voice cut through the tension. She strode forward, heels clicking, her smile triumphant. Since Olivia’s disappearance, she’d been practically glowing.

Alexander’s expression darkened at the sight of her.

Evelyn handed her purse to Sebastian like a queen dismissing a servant. "Reserve my usual table for dinner with Liam tonight. And check his schedule—I’m planning a trip to Montecarlo next week."

Sebastian nodded, retreating quickly.

Alexander scoffed. "This is the urgent work keeping Liam busy?"

Evelyn crossed her arms, blocking his path. "Mr. Hayes, I get that you’re upset, but blaming Liam is unfair. Olivia insisted on visiting that cemetery alone. What happened is her fault."

Alexander’s jaw tightened. "And what exactly is your role in this, Miss Hartley? As Liam’s friend? Or something more?"

Evelyn’s face twisted with fury. "If Olivia hadn’t refused to sign the divorce papers, Liam and I would be together by now! Who’s really interfering here?"

Alexander smirked coldly. "Oh, it’s very clear to everyone."

Evelyn’s hand flew up to strike him—but Alexander caught her wrist mid-air, his grip unyielding.

"I don’t hit women," he said icily. "But I’ll make an exception if you insist."

She yanked her arm back, seething. Then, abruptly, her anger melted into a venomous smile. "You’re one to talk, Alexander. Olivia’s still married, yet you couldn’t keep your hands off her. And let’s not forget—she got pregnant with your child and tried to pass it off as Liam’s. How noble of you both."

Alexander’s knuckles whitened.

Evelyn leaned in, whispering, "Who’s the real villain here?"

Then she turned and walked away, leaving him standing there, fists clenched in silent fury.

(To be continued...)
###Chapter 216

Alexander's eyes widened in shock, his voice laced with disbelief. "What kind of nonsense is this?"

Evelyn mistook his reaction for guilt—proof that she had cornered him.

Blind to the truth and Liam's ignorance, Evelyn couldn't help but smirk, convinced she had dirt on both Alexander and Olivia.

"According to the doctor, the baby Olivia's carrying couldn't possibly be Liam's, not if you look at the timeline," Evelyn declared with calculated confidence. "During that period, you were the one she was seen with most. If you're not the father, then who is? Seems like you're trying to back out now. Poor Olivia, stuck in such a mess."

Alexander inhaled sharply, his mind racing as the implications sank in.

It hit him—the doctor must have been bribed. And Liam, that fool, was still clueless, unaware that Olivia's unborn child was actually his.

There had never been anything between Alexander and Olivia beyond friendship. A romantic entanglement was impossible, let alone an affair.

Alexander knew Olivia would never betray Liam. Her love for him was pure, unwavering.

Yet people like Evelyn stooped so low, fabricating scandals to ruin Olivia's reputation. Even Liam, who should have been her strongest defender, doubted her. The injustice burned in Alexander's chest.

Still, part of him saw a silver lining. With all this chaos, Olivia might finally break free from Liam and start fresh with her child, unshackled from the past.

But Evelyn's smug, venomous grin grated on his nerves.

Steeling himself, Alexander snapped, "Olivia is under the protection of the Whitmore family. Any insult to her is an insult to me. Don't delude yourself into thinking I'll back down just because Liam supports you. Your threats mean nothing. If you dare slander Olivia again, you won't like what happens next."

His voice carried a chilling promise, wiping the smirk off Evelyn's face instantly.

She met his unwavering gaze and understood—he wasn't bluffing. He had the power and the will to follow through.

Fear twisted inside her, mingled with envy. Why did Olivia always have someone defending her? What was so special about her supposed innocence?

Unwilling to back down, Evelyn challenged, "If you want to make an enemy of the Blackwood family, then go ahead."

"Is that so?" Alexander sneered.

Just then, Liam's voice cut in from behind. "Evelyn has a habit of joking too much. Mr. Hayes, don't take her words seriously."

Turning, they saw Liam approaching.

Evelyn immediately rushed to him, wrapping her arms around his waist, her demeanor shifting dramatically.

No longer the aggressor, she adopted a pitiful tone. "Liam, I was just upset for you. I asked Mr. Hayes not to bother you about Olivia, but he threatened me. I was so scared."

Liam swiftly pulled her behind him, shielding her. "Mr. Hayes, are you picking a fight with me?" His voice dripped with hostility.

Alexander scoffed. Sometimes, he truly questioned Liam's taste. How could he fall for someone like Evelyn?

But now that he'd pieced together the truth from Evelyn's accusations, his anger faded. Instead, he pitied Liam. "You two really are perfect for each other. I genuinely hope you have a happy marriage. After all, it's rare to find another couple so utterly lacking in morals."

Liam's expression darkened at the sarcasm. "When you seduced my wife, did you forget about your own lack of principles?"

Alexander couldn't resist asking, "Are you sure Olivia's child is mine?"

Liam's face twisted in disgust. "Mr. Hayes, do you take pride in these games?"

Alexander sighed, realizing further conversation was pointless. As he turned to leave, he dropped one last remark. "Liam, I just hope you won't regret this."

Watching Alexander walk away, Liam was seized by conflicting emotions.

Unbidden memories flashed through his mind—him holding Olivia's hand, whispering apologies, promising to care for her and their child. But he couldn't recall ever saying those words. Why did these fragments feel so real yet so foreign?

Though he'd identified the source of the drugs he'd been given and stopped taking them, the lingering effects persisted.

During a recent consultation, his doctor had warned, "If medication fails, we may need to consider surgery."

The doctor was en route to Eldermere, though his arrival time remained uncertain.

Evelyn touched his arm, concern in her voice. "Liam, are you okay?"

He blinked, his expression smoothing. "I'm fine," he said, gently pulling away.

Unaware of his withdrawal, Evelyn basked in the sweetness of him defending her earlier.

Softly, she asked, "I had Sebastian reserve a table at the restaurant. Are you free tonight?"

Liam nodded. "I have a meeting this afternoon, but I'll have Sebastian take you somewhere to relax first."

With that, he walked away.

Evelyn watched him go, her eyes shining with infatuation. As she plotted her next move, excitement surged.

With Olivia out of the picture, nothing could stop her now.

Alexander and William left shortly after, the venue growing quieter.

Liam hadn't bothered to hide their visit.

News of Olivia's plight spread like wildfire, sparking outrage online.

One comment read, "I was never her biggest fan, but what the Blackwoods are doing to her is cruel."

Another agreed, "She's Liam's wife, not his enemy. How can they be so heartless?"

"Honestly, she brought this on herself. Why cling to the Blackwoods? She should've just taken the money and lived quietly."

"That's harsh. She's missing now—we don't even know if she's alive. Have some compassion."

As debates raged, Liam "reluctantly" ordered a search for Olivia.

Evelyn, unable to stomach the criticism aimed at Liam, dropped her polished act to argue directly with commenters.

Liam observed the chaos with detached amusement.

"Keep painting Olivia as the victim," he instructed his team. "And stir up rumors about her bad relationship with Richard's family. That man conspired with Dean—whether Richard knew or not is irrelevant. As public pressure mounts, let's see if they turn on each other. I'll wait for the fallout."

###Chapter 217

Liam gave a curt nod, immediately understanding Richard's game plan. The younger Winslow brother was clearly waiting for Dominic and that other man to turn on each other.

The car rolled to a stop. "Mr. Blackwood, we've arrived at Mercy Hospital," Sebastian announced.

Liam acknowledged with a slight tilt of his head before snapping his leather-bound planner shut.

Outside the ICU doors, Richard and Catherine were engaged in a vicious shouting match.

A stunning young woman clung to Richard's arm, shooting triumphant smirks at Catherine.

Catherine's face flushed crimson with rage. "Richard, have you no shame? Flaunting your mistress in public is bad enough, but bringing her here? You're making a spectacle of yourself."

Richard rolled his eyes dramatically. "Beatrice was worried about me. She didn't want me exhausting myself with all these hospital visits. Meanwhile, my own wife shows no concern for my wellbeing. Shouldn't I appreciate someone who actually cares?"

Catherine's hands trembled with suppressed fury. "I've been begging you to go home for days! You're the one obsessed with maintaining appearances. Just remember - when the press catches you canoodling in hospital corridors, don't come crying to me for damage control."

Richard's expression turned icy. "You've failed to give me an heir. What's wrong with seeking company elsewhere? I've nothing to fear from scandal. If anything, you should be the embarrassed one when this gets out."

Contempt flashed in Catherine's eyes, her gaze turning arctic with undisguised revulsion.

"Richard, Catherine's concern is valid," a new voice interjected. "With our mother still in critical condition, media spotting you with other women would ruin your carefully crafted image as the devoted son." Both Winslows turned to see Liam approaching.

Richard's lips curled into a sneer. "Even if they call me unfaithful, it's nothing compared to your heartlessness. The accident happened near your estate when Mother was coming to see you. Makes one wonder about your involvement."

Seizing the opportunity, Catherine shifted focus from the mistress to add, "Recently, during her lucid moments, Margaret keeps calling your name. Whatever issues you had over Olivia's situation, she's still your mother."

It was remarkable how quickly the estranged couple could unite against a common enemy.

Liam remained unruffled by their accusations, even managing an amused smile. "Richard, you know exactly why I couldn't come earlier. Isn't this what you wanted?"

Richard's composure cracked. "What are you implying? I contacted you immediately after the accident! If you truly wanted to see Mother, who could have stopped you?"

A cold laugh escaped Liam's lips. "You were too busy causing problems at Grandfather's gravesite. Had I tried visiting then, you'd have found some excuse to turn me away, wouldn't you?"

Liam had suspected Richard's involvement, and Richard had anticipated these suspicions.

The younger Winslow remained calm, confident Liam lacked concrete evidence.

But Richard hadn't expected such direct confrontation. Liam's bluntness left him momentarily speechless, all prepared rebuttals evaporating.

Noting Richard's reaction, Liam chuckled darkly, clapping a hand on his brother's shoulder. "Richard, I know you're not the brightest, but next time? Clean up your messes properly. Before conspiring with someone, investigate whether they have ulterior motives. That man betrayed you the moment I confronted him. Your partnership wasn't as solid as you imagined."

Richard's face darkened instantly. He shrugged off Liam's hand. "What nonsense are you spouting? I've been buried in Mother's medical paperwork! I haven't had time for anything else!"

Yet the flicker of panic in his eyes betrayed his guilt.

Liam pressed on mercilessly. "There seems to be a misunderstanding. That man thought the child Olivia carried was mine. But that baby has nothing to do with me. You schemed to whisk her away, thinking her pregnancy could be used against me. Didn't see that coming, did you?"

Richard's expression cycled through rage, shame, and frustration like a bad stage performance.

Catherine mentally cursed her husband before stepping between the brothers. "Liam, you're clearly stressed and imagining things. I don't follow your logic. Let's drop this. You should see your mother. Even unconscious, she'd want to hear your voice. It might help her recovery."

Liam glanced at the ICU doors but made no move to enter. His voice turned glacial. "Don't insult my intelligence. I see through your schemes perfectly. I came today to confront you openly. Richard, we share blood. If you have grievances, face me directly. These underhanded tactics prove your weakness."

All traces of humor vanished from Liam's face, his gaze turning arctic. "This is your final warning, Richard. Stop now, and I'll pretend none of this happened."

Richard clenched his jaw, choosing stubborn silence.

Without another word, Liam turned on his heel and strode away.

Sebastian hurried to catch up. "Mr. Blackwood, why didn't you visit your mother?"

Liam's expression hardened. "Now that I'm certain Richard's plotting against me, I won't walk blindly into his traps. He may lack intelligence, but his ruthlessness knows no bounds. Who knows what extremes he'll resort to next?"

Sebastian paled at the implication. "But she's his mother. Margaret's always been his staunchest supporter. It's unthinkable he'd go that far."

Liam's laugh held no mirth. "Perhaps Margaret's 'accident' wasn't so accidental after all."

Sebastian recoiled, struggling to process this. He'd always viewed Richard as merely petty - engaging in childish rivalries with Liam, lacking proper elder brother qualities.

The idea that Richard could be capable of such malice was beyond Sebastian's comprehension.

As Liam departed, Richard and Catherine's expressions darkened with impotent rage.

"Useless!" Richard spat venomously.

Beatrice, still clinging to his arm, simpered, "Richard darling, you're frightening me."

Before Catherine could react, Richard whirled and struck Beatrice across the face. "Get out!"

Clutching her cheek, the humiliated woman scrambled to collect her belongings and fled.

A perverse satisfaction warmed Catherine's heart. However strained their marriage, they were undeniably bound together now. Richard would find it impossible to discard her.
###Chapter 218

"If rage could kill, you'd be buried six feet under by now," Catherine sneered, seizing the opportunity to taunt Richard.

Richard's head snapped up, his eyes blazing with venom. "You guaranteed that man could help me eliminate Liam. Look how that turned out! The plan was to have him murder Olivia and her baby, but instead he betrayed us by spiriting her away and letting Liam uncover everything! Today, Liam made me a laughingstock. You know how vigilant he is. This blunder has only tightened the noose around my neck."

Despite the circumstances, Catherine felt compelled to defend Victor. "Maybe he had his reasons. Instead of shouting here, why not confront him directly and demand answers?"

Richard's face flushed crimson, his breaths coming in ragged gasps as he conceded. "You're right. I'll look him in the eye and hear his excuses myself."

Abandoning all caution, Richard stormed out, making a beeline for Victor's residence.

Catherine frowned, her hands trembling with unease. Richard seemed oblivious to the risk of Liam's men tracking his every move.

Upstairs, Olivia observed the commotion as Richard barged in. The fury contorting his features was unmistakable as he marched forward with Catherine in tow.

Olivia never imagined Richard would conspire with Victor. Despite sharing blood with Liam, Richard had crossed every line imaginable.

Miranda, alerted by the disturbance, took in the scene and immediately grasped the situation. She shot Olivia a withering glare. "This is all your fault. Richard's only causing trouble for Victor because of you. You're nothing but a curse!"

Olivia remained impassive despite Miranda's vitriol. She'd grown accustomed to such treatment. Now she could even retort with icy composure.

Her fingers flew across her phone screen. "If I'm such a burden, make your choice. Either finish me or set me free."

As a physician, Miranda knew precisely how to torment Olivia without endangering the unborn child.

This knowledge made Olivia's existence increasingly unbearable.

Moreover, Olivia understood escape was impossible without Liam's intervention. Though the Sinclair and Bennett families continued searching for her, their efforts proved futile.

This was fundamentally a Blackwood family conflict. As Liam's wife, if the Blackwoods claimed no outside interference was needed, rescue became improbable. Olivia realized she was merely a pawn in their vicious power struggle.

The realization washed over her like a tidal wave of exhaustion. She bowed her head with a heavy sigh.

Miranda noted Richard's hostile demeanor and sensed the day wouldn't end peacefully.

After a tense pause, Miranda seized Olivia's wrist.

Olivia looked up, bewildered.

Miranda's lips curled into a frosty smile. "You started this disaster, so you'll clean it up. If matters aren't settled today, blood will spill. Should anything happen to Victor because of you, severe punishment is inevitable."

Olivia's pulse raced with terror, yet part of her had stopped caring about the consequences.

As Miranda dragged Olivia toward Richard and Catherine, they witnessed Richard strike Victor.

Victor staggered from the blow but restrained himself from retaliation.

Miranda's heart clenched with anguish. She tightened her grip on Olivia's arm with bruising force and shoved her forward.

"Richard, here's your problem. Do what you want with her, but leave Victor out of this," Miranda demanded.

Richard turned slowly, a chilling smile twisting his lips. His gaze flickered over Olivia's pallid face before settling on her barely visible baby bump.

"What if she follows Catherine's example and births another useless girl? Wouldn't that disappoint you?" Richard taunted Victor.

Victor dabbed blood from his split lip with calculated calm. "The child's gender is irrelevant. Yes, I broke our agreement, but it served your interests. Even if Liam cares nothing for Olivia, harming her would give him justification to retaliate. A mutually beneficial compromise is wiser."

Richard's rage reignited. "Do you take me for a fool? You're clearly scheming to use that bastard child for your own ends! Meanwhile, that idiot Liam still doesn't realize it's his!"

"Richard!" Catherine's warning came too late.

Olivia, standing frozen, absorbed every word. Her head snapped up in shock as she scanned the room. What did Richard mean about Liam not knowing? And Catherine's expression suggested she'd known all along.

Recalling her hospitalization when Liam discovered her pregnancy, Olivia remembered Catherine's constant presence.

Suddenly, everything clicked with devastating clarity. Liam's apparent disdain for their child stemmed from believing it wasn't his. What monstrous lies had these people fed him?

Olivia clapped a hand over her mouth as silent sobs wracked her body.

Richard's face briefly registered regret before hardening again. "I considered sparing you," he said icily. "Now I see no reason to."

Olivia collapsed into a nearby chair, feeling like prey surrounded by wolves.

Miranda seized the moment to pressure Victor. "Mr. Blackwood, Olivia's useless to us now. If she tells Liam the truth, they might reconcile, ruining all our plans. Mercy isn't an option."

Victor remained silent, calculation gleaming in his eyes.

Catherine added, "We still have Evelyn, and others if needed. As long as we control Liam's circle, manipulating him is easy. Olivia's an unpredictable liability we can't afford."

Victor's gaze shifted to Olivia as he suddenly proposed, "Shouldn't we hear Olivia's opinion?"

The atmosphere shifted palpably.

Richard scoffed. "Of course she'll beg to live. Who wouldn't?"

Olivia lifted tear-filled eyes to meet Victor's gaze, a shudder running through her.

Beneath his benign facade, Victor was the most venomous serpent of all.

Clenching her fists, Olivia shook her head in despair, conveying complete resignation.

Miranda's smile widened. "See? She's given up. Whatever happens won't be on our conscience."

Richard declared, "This is your final chance. Eliminate Olivia, or our partnership ends."
###Chapter 219

Victor Blackwood finally dropped his composed facade, his expression twisting into one of feigned embarrassment. Turning to Miranda Graves, he sighed dramatically. "Fine, you deal with this mess. I'm drained."

Miranda's eyes glittered with dark excitement. She had waited years for this moment. Her lips curled into a vicious smile as she locked eyes with Olivia Sinclair, her gaze sharp enough to draw blood.

Olivia shuddered, her stomach knotting with dread. If Miranda took control, survival was no longer an option—it was a fantasy.

Miranda seized Olivia's wrist with bruising force, her voice dripping with venom. "Play along, and I might grant you a quick death. Struggle, and I'll make sure you suffer."

Olivia clenched her jaw but forced herself to stand. With leaden steps, she followed Miranda out of the hall.

The second they crossed the threshold, Olivia wrenched free. Desperation clawed at her throat as she gestured frantically, her mute lips forming silent pleas.

Amused, Miranda tossed her phone at Olivia. "Since you're about to die, go ahead. Say your last words."

Olivia's fingers flew across the screen. "Do you really think Victor chose you because he trusts you?"

Miranda scoffed. "Of course he does. Don't flatter yourself—he only kept you around because you were useful. He never cared about you."

Olivia exhaled sharply and typed again. "When the truth comes out, he’ll have powerful allies shielding him. But you? You’ll be the one they crucify."

Miranda’s face darkened. "Liam Blackwood would never abandon me."

Olivia didn’t argue. She simply smirked, letting the silence speak for her.

A cold unease slithered down Miranda’s spine. Victor was ruthless—she’d seen him discard even Evelyn Hartley without hesitation. His cunning was what had drawn her to him in the first place.

But what if she was just another pawn?

No. She refused to believe it. After years of loyalty, surely she meant something to him.

Her head throbbed as doubt gnawed at her. She studied Olivia, her expression unreadable.

Originally, Miranda had planned to drug Olivia and let fate decide her suffering. But now…

A slow, chilling laugh escaped her lips. "You’ve convinced me. I won’t kill you—but I won’t make survival easy either."

Olivia’s blood turned to ice. She swallowed hard, forcing herself to stay composed. If she lived through this, she’d make them all pay.

Miranda, oddly cheerful now, led Olivia to her private residence. The moment they arrived, she made a call.

The language she spoke was foreign—a mix of Westhaven’s dialect and something harsher, guttural.

Miranda snapped photos of Olivia from every angle, treating her like livestock at an auction.

Olivia’s mind raced. A horrifying realization struck—Miranda wasn’t just punishing her. She was selling her.

But to whom?

Olivia squeezed her eyes shut. Suddenly, Liam’s face flashed in her mind—his piercing gaze, the unreadable tension in his jaw.

Why was she thinking of him now?

Hate? Regret?

It didn’t matter. She’d never see him again.

Miranda’s voice snapped her back to reality. An hour later, a car arrived.

Olivia’s hands and feet were bound, a blindfold shoved over her eyes. She was shoved into the backseat, helpless.

The driver’s voice was rough. "She looks decent. Any health issues?"

Miranda smirked. "She’s healthy. Just pregnant. Handle that carefully."

Olivia’s stomach twisted. Miranda didn’t care about the baby—this was a trap.

The driver chuckled. "A mute? Perfect. Less trouble."

Olivia stiffened. The Kensington family? Who were they?

She thrashed, but a cloth clamped over her mouth.

The world spun.

Darkness swallowed her.

Back at the residence, Miranda was met by a grim-faced man.

"Mr. Blackwood sent me to check on the situation."

Miranda’s smile was flawless. "It’s handled. Would you like proof?"

The man studied her before nodding. "Good. Just ensure no loose ends."

Miranda watched him leave, her fingers tightening around her phone.

Olivia Sinclair was gone.

But the game was far from over.
###Chapter 220

Olivia Sinclair awoke to the unsettling realization that she was no longer in familiar surroundings. Her wrists and ankles were tightly bound, the rough fibers of the rope digging into her skin. The blindfold that had obscured her vision was gone, but the dim interior of the car offered little comfort.

The driver was nowhere in sight, his muffled voice carrying from outside as he spoke to someone. The words were indistinct, swallowed by the hum of distant traffic.

Gritting her teeth, Olivia tested her restraints. Her muscles protested, weakened from whatever drug they had given her, but desperation fueled her movements. She twisted her wrists, wincing as the rope scraped against raw skin, but bit by bit, the knots loosened.

Finally, one hand slipped free.

She wasted no time untying the rest.

The moment her feet touched the pavement, a shout rang out.

"Stop right there!"

The driver lunged toward her, cursing under his breath.

Olivia didn't hesitate. She bolted, her legs shaky but determined. The highway stretched before her, cars speeding past in a blur of motion. Without thinking, she stepped into the road, arms raised.

Tires screeched. A sleek black sedan jerked to a halt mere inches from her.

The driver chasing her froze, panting, his expression torn between frustration and caution.

The car door swung open, and a woman emerged—graceful, poised, her white dress fluttering in the breeze.

Olivia's heart leapt. She gestured frantically, her hands trembling as she tried to convey her plight.

The woman's voice was like silk. "Are you all just going to stand there? Help her up."

Relief flooded Olivia as hands steadied her. The woman—Seraphina Kensington—smiled, her delicate features softening with warmth. Dimples appeared at the corners of her lips.

"Thank you," Olivia signed, her gratitude pouring out in silent motions.

Seraphina inclined her head, but then a violent cough wracked her frame. Her complexion paled, and her attendant rushed forward.

"Miss Kensington, you shouldn’t be out here. The wind is too harsh—"

"I'm fine," Seraphina interrupted, though her voice was strained. Her gaze lingered on Olivia, assessing.

Then, the driver from before stepped forward, bowing slightly. "Miss Kensington, my apologies. She was supposed to be sedated, but she’s... resourceful."

Olivia stiffened.

Seraphina Kensington.

The name sent a chill down her spine. This was the family the driver and Miranda Graves had mentioned.

Seraphina chuckled softly, her eyes glinting with something unreadable. "Well, she’s here now. Though I must say, she’s not quite what I expected."

The driver shrugged. "Abductions aren’t easy these days. She’s mute, but otherwise healthy. Except—" He hesitated. "She’s pregnant."

Olivia’s stomach twisted.

Seraphina arched a brow. "So you’re telling me that as the one paying, I don’t get to be selective?"

The driver blanched. "No, of course not! If there were better options—"

"Enough," Seraphina cut in, waving a hand. "I’ll take her for now. There’s still time."

The driver exhaled in relief and hurried away.

Seraphina turned back to Olivia, her expression unreadable. "You’re quite pretty," she mused. "What does your family do?"

Olivia pressed her lips together.

A sharp shove sent her stumbling. "Answer her!"

Seraphina’s smile didn’t waver, though her eyes hardened. "No need for roughness."

Olivia signed slowly, her hands steady despite the fear clawing at her. I have no family. I’m nobody.

Seraphina tilted her head. "That’s fine. All I need is for you to be healthy."

Olivia frowned. What did that mean?

Seraphina turned to her assistant. "We’re leaving for Westhaven immediately."

The assistant hesitated. "But Miss Kensington, your grandfather is still in Eldermere. Your mother insisted—"

"My health comes first," Seraphina snapped. Then, softer, "And do you really believe this woman has no connections? Let’s not invite trouble."

Olivia barely had time to process before she was ushered into another car.

Beside her, the assistant spoke briskly to the driver. "Take her to the hospital first. Full examination."

The sterile scent of antiseptic filled Olivia’s nose as doctors poked and prodded. Everything was normal, they said.

Except for the pregnancy.

She stood outside the consultation room, her breath catching as the assistant’s voice drifted through the door.

"Can the pregnancy be terminated?"

Olivia’s blood ran cold.

###Chapter 221

Olivia Sinclair sprang up from her seat, her entire body trembling. Her frightened eyes darted toward the consultation room as beads of sweat formed on her palms.

To her relief, the doctor shook his head firmly. "She's had a previous termination. Another abortion could make future conception difficult. More critically, it would severely impact her health—possibly causing irreversible damage. If you want her to remain healthy, I strongly advise against it."

Celeste Dumont's face darkened with displeasure. "Then at least prescribe something to restore her vitality. She needs to regain her strength."

A cold voice suddenly sliced through the air near Olivia, addressing Celeste. "Aren't you Seraphina's assistant? Did she send you here to fetch medicine for her?"

Celeste spun around to find Donovan Kensington standing in the doorway, his expression unreadable.

Uncertain how long he had been there or what he had overheard, Celeste quickly masked her surprise with a practiced smile. "Miss Kensington is perfectly fine. It's just one of her maids who fell ill and needed medical attention. Thank you for your concern, Mr. Kensington."

"Is that so?" Donovan's gaze dropped to Olivia.

Olivia immediately lowered her eyes, refusing to meet his.

At first, she had considered appealing to Donovan for help. But he bore the Kensington name and appeared close to Seraphina. Being family, Olivia assumed they would naturally protect each other. Any reckless move on her part might ruin her only chance at freedom.

Donovan adjusted his glasses, his striking features shadowed by suspicion. "Do I frighten you? Why won't you look at me?" he asked Olivia.

Olivia ducked her head even lower.

Celeste swiftly stepped between them, offering a placating smile. "Forgive her, Mr. Kensington. This maid is new and still adjusting. She's mute and painfully shy—an orphan, actually. If not for Miss Kensington's kindness, she wouldn't have found work with the family. Please excuse her."

Donovan chuckled, though his smile carried a frosty edge. "I never thought I'd see the day Seraphina developed a soft heart. Still, it's a refreshing change. Tell her there's no need for such caution. Grandfather and I fully support her."

"Of course, sir." Celeste nodded in understanding.

Positioned behind Celeste, Olivia missed the subtle shift in Donovan's expression.

Donovan studied Olivia one last time before turning to leave. Yet, just as he stepped into the elevator, he glanced back.

At that exact moment, Olivia lifted her gaze, and their eyes locked for a fleeting second.

Olivia's eyes were strikingly vivid—not the naive innocence of youth, but a quiet resilience tempered by hardship.

That look struck a chord deep within Donovan. Once ignited, the sense of familiarity clung to him. He couldn't place where he'd seen those eyes before, yet they left an indelible mark.

They reminded him of eyes from his childhood dreams—similar, yet tinged with sorrow and gentleness. But the memory of their owner remained frustratingly out of reach.

The elevator's chime snapped him from his thoughts. Shaking off the haunting sensation, he stepped inside.

In a lavish hospital suite resembling a penthouse—complete with a living area, bedroom, and kitchen—an elderly man played the piano.

Staff moved with hushed reverence, careful not to disturb him. After all, he was the most respected figure in Eldermere.

Footsteps approached. Seraphina entered, cradling a bouquet, her smile radiant.

As the music ceased, she praised warmly, "Grandfather, your playing grows more beautiful each day."

Her tone then turned concerned. "But you mustn't overexert yourself. The doctors insist on rest. We can't have you falling ill again."

Alistair Kensington stared blankly out the window, ignoring her completely.

Masking her irritation, Seraphina knelt before him. "Grandfather, why not rest? Shall I have the piano moved?"

His voice cut like ice. "Who are you to rearrange my belongings?"

Her smile faltered. "Grandfather, surely you remember? I'm Seraphina, your granddaughter."

His expression shifted. "My granddaughter? Then where is my other granddaughter?" he murmured, eyes clouding with grief.

Seraphina's jaw tightened. She couldn't fathom his obsession with a woman long gone—possibly dead.

"Seraphina." Donovan entered. "I approved the piano. It's his sole joy now. At his age, shouldn't we cherish what brings him happiness?"

She blinked innocently. "Donovan, I only meant—"

He interrupted firmly. "The doctors said engaging his passions may restore his memory. If you truly care, let him be."

"Fine," she conceded through gritted teeth.

Suddenly, she clutched her chest, her face paling.

Donovan frowned. "Are you unwell again?"

She shook her head weakly. "It's nothing. Grandfather's health matters more."

Alistair, momentarily lucid, glanced at her. "I've told you to prioritize yourself. Donovan handles things here. There's no need for you to visit so often."

She forced a gentle smile. "I worry about you. But I have performances coming up, so I must return to Westhaven. My trusted physicians are there—Eldermere's hospitals, while advanced, aren't familiar to me."

Alistair nodded. "Don't trouble yourself. I'll arrange your transport to the private airfield."

Donovan, silent until now, abruptly recalled Olivia's haunting eyes. "Seraphina, stay a while longer. I've scheduled a specialist for you next week—he's only available then."
###Chapter 222

Tyrone gave a slow nod, considering Donovan's proposal carefully. "You know Donovan's resources well. Since he's arranged for a specialist to examine you, you should stay and consult the doctor. Your health comes first."

Seraphina's lips tightened almost imperceptibly before she forced a polite smile. "If scheduling becomes an issue, let's not trouble ourselves. No matter how many physicians I see, my condition never improves. I'd prefer returning to Westhaven."

Donovan studied her with an unreadable expression. "You seem displeased with me. Very well, forget I mentioned it."

Trapped by his words, Seraphina had no choice but to relent. She bit her lip briefly before murmuring, "But I do wish to see the doctor. Thank you for arranging this, Donovan."

He acknowledged her with a curt nod, then flicked a glance toward the door—a silent command for her to leave.

Yet Seraphina ignored the hint. Instead, she moved behind Tyrone and began kneading his shoulders gently. "Grandfather, I heard rumors that my cousin might be found soon. Is it true? What does she look like? I’ve never even seen a photo of her—or her mother. I can’t even imagine her face."

Tyrone’s smile vanished, his gaze turning distant. "I don’t know what she looks like either."

Seeing the distress flicker across the old man’s face, Donovan intervened swiftly. "Grandfather, don’t worry. I’ve already sent word to the Hartley family. Once Evelyn arrives, you can see for yourself if she’s the one we’ve been searching for."

"Hartley family? Evelyn?" Seraphina paused, feigning realization. "Evelyn is our missing cousin? That would be wonderful news."

Donovan caught the subtle provocation in her tone, and irritation edged his voice. "It’s not confirmed yet. This isn’t something you need to concern yourself with."

Seraphina’s eyes shimmered with wounded pride. "Why? Just because my health has kept me from family affairs doesn’t mean I shouldn’t ask. Are you angry with me?"

Tears welled in her eyes, spilling over her pale cheeks. The flush of distress made her delicate features appear even more fragile, rendering any reprimand impossible.

Donovan suppressed a sigh. He knew Seraphina’s congenital heart condition made her untouchable—no one dared upset her, not even him.

Though she had long outgrown the innocence of childhood, to Donovan, she remained his cousin.

His tone softened. "I didn’t mean it like that. Nothing’s confirmed yet. I plan to bring Evelyn to the hospital for Grandfather to meet. If he recognizes her, we’ll proceed with a DNA test. After all, he’s the only one who ever saw my aunt and cousin."

Seraphina dabbed at her tears and nodded meekly. "I understand."

Beneath her compliant façade, resentment simmered. How could someone missing for decades still claim a place in the Kensington family—especially when she didn’t even share their name?

She couldn’t fathom why her grandfather, in his twilight years, was so fixated on finding this lost granddaughter—even suggesting she inherit half the family fortune.

Worse, Donovan seemed indifferent to the idea.

A cold dread coiled in her chest. Her fragile health had always secured her the undivided attention of the family. The thought of sharing that love with an outsider was unbearable.

Having gathered enough, Seraphina excused herself.

As she stepped into the hallway, she nearly collided with a man.

He reacted instantly, gripping her arm to steady her.

Seraphina looked up—and froze.

The man had a razor-sharp jawline, dark eyes that cut like obsidian, and an imposing stature that left her pulse erratic. Though she’d seen handsome men before, none had ever affected her like this.

Yet his expression remained icy, devoid of warmth.

Once she regained her balance, he released her immediately and stepped back, his lips pressed into a thin line of disinterest.

Nearby, Sebastian offered an apologetic smile. "Apologies, miss. Mr. Blackwood is in a hurry. Are you all right?"

Seraphina ignored him, her gaze locked on Liam.

"Mr. Blackwood? Of the Blackwood family?" Her voice dripped with quiet disdain as she assessed him, her pretty face twisting with barely concealed arrogance.

Sebastian tensed, recognizing the unspoken privilege in her tone.

Before the tension could escalate, Donovan emerged from Tyrone’s room and shot Seraphina a warning look. "Seraphina, this is a guest. If you’re done, return to your room."

Reluctantly, she stepped aside, allowing Liam to pass.

As he walked away, she couldn’t resist stealing another glance—but he never looked back.

A storm of emotions darkened her eyes.

Right now, she had a more pressing problem: Olivia.

If Olivia remained in Eldermere, complications would arise.

But letting her leave for Westhaven wasn’t an option—not when Seraphina needed her under watch. She’d have to find someone trustworthy to keep Olivia contained.

Meanwhile, as Olivia was escorted out by Seraphina’s men, she spotted familiar cars in the hospital garage.

One glance, and she knew—they belonged to Liam.

Her heart pounded. She wanted to slip free, to run to those cars and beg for help.

But with so many eyes on her, it was impossible.

For the first time, she realized Seraphina’s gentle exterior hid something far more dangerous. One wrong move, and the consequences would be dire.

Clenching her fists, Olivia walked past Liam’s cars without a glance.

As she slid into the waiting vehicle, Seraphina’s sweet voice confirmed her fears. "I thought you might try to escape. Good thing you didn’t. If you’d run to those people in the garage, I’d have dragged you back and broken your legs."

A chill slithered down Olivia’s spine despite the daylight. She swallowed hard, grateful she hadn’t acted impulsively.

Seraphina smiled brightly. "Behave, and you’ll stay unharmed. Remember—I saved you from traffickers. Don’t even think of running. It’s impossible. Understood?"

Olivia picked up the phone Seraphina had given her and typed:

"Spare me and my child, and I’ll obey."
###Chapter 223

The fleeting kindness in Seraphina's eyes vanished as quickly as it appeared. Their vehicle had barely cleared the hospital's underground parking when two sleek black sedans cut them off.

Seraphina's breath hitched. The men stepping out wore the unmistakable Kensington insignia on their lapels - Donovan's personal security detail.

After a tense exchange, their driver turned with an apologetic grimace. "Miss Kensington, Mr. Donovan insists on speaking with you immediately. He requests your presence in his vehicle."

Seraphina's fingers twitched toward Olivia Sinclair beside her. "Tell them I'm unwell," she said icily. "I need to return home."

The driver relayed her refusal, but one bodyguard marched forward and rapped sharply on their window.

Jaw clenched, Seraphina lowered the glass. "Was I unclear?"

"Mr. Donovan is most concerned for your safety," the guard said smoothly. "With recent... developments, he insists you stay at the family estate where we can properly protect you."

A muscle jumped in Seraphina's cheek. Since when had Donovan cared about her wellbeing? Their once-close cousinly bond had frayed to near nonexistence over the years.

Her gaze flickered to Olivia. Exposure now would ruin everything. "It's hardly proper for unmarried relatives to cohabitate," she demurred. "I appreciate the concern, but-"

"Mr. Donovan anticipated your hesitation," the guard interrupted. "The west wing has been prepared with a full medical team, including specialists transferred from Westhaven. Given his extended stay to locate your missing cousin..." He let the implication hang.

Seraphina's nails bit into her palms. The trap snapped shut with mathematical precision. Any further protest would only raise suspicions.

"Very well," she conceded through gritted teeth. "Lead the way."

The moment the guards turned, Seraphina whipped out her phone. "You incompetent fool!" she hissed at her assistant. "Donovan spotted Olivia at the hospital! If he uncovers our plans-"

Her throat closed around the unspoken threat. The Kensington fortune hung in precarious balance. Grandfather Alistair's clear favoritism toward Donovan was no secret, and her brother's recent... missteps had left their branch vulnerable.

Olivia watched the exchange with dawning comprehension. Though she couldn't decipher the words, the tension crackling between them was unmistakable. Someone had interfered with Seraphina's plans - someone powerful enough to make the haughty heiress comply.

"Shall I relocate the mute, Miss Kensington?" the driver ventured.

Seraphina's laugh was razor-edged. "And confirm his suspicions? No. She remains with me as my... charitable project." She turned predatory eyes on Olivia. "Remember, disobedience will cost more than your life. That precious burden you carry? It hangs by my mercy alone."

Olivia nodded mutely, her mind racing. This unexpected protector - this Donovan - might just be her salvation.

Meanwhile at the Kensington estate, Donovan was informed of an urgent visitor - Liam Blackwood, the man he'd briefly encountered at Mercy Hospital.

Though their acquaintance was superficial, their single meeting at a charity gala had left an impression. Intrigued despite himself, Donovan ordered, "Show him to the study in ten minutes."

He found Liam examining his bookshelves with unusual intensity.

"Find anything of interest, Mr. Blackwood?" Donovan inquired.

Liam started, as if surfacing from deep thought. "Not my usual taste," he admitted. "But a... friend of mine enjoys this genre."

The hesitation before "friend" didn't escape Donovan's notice. Nor did the way Liam's fingers lingered on a particular volume - one Donovan knew well.

It was Olivia Sinclair's favorite.
###Chapter 224

"I never would have imagined you had such similar interests with her," Liam commented.

Donovan's curiosity was instantly aroused. "Is that so? What an interesting coincidence. I'd very much like to meet her."

Liam remained silent, a fleeting shadow of weariness and bitterness passing across his features.

Donovan gestured toward the antique bookshelf. "Though I was raised in Westhaven, my soul belongs to Eldermere. My entire family - grandfather, parents, and aunt - made certain I never forgot my roots. These ancient texts found me when I had little connection to my homeland. At first, they were incomprehensible, written in a script I'd never studied. But I taught myself, page by page. It's become more than just reading - I've developed a passion for collecting antiquities. I suppose your friend shares this interest?"

A faint smile touched Liam's lips. "You've guessed correctly." Olivia didn't merely appreciate antiques - she possessed a rare talent for restoring them. But Liam kept this detail to himself.

Donovan smoothly redirected the conversation. "You didn't come here today just to discuss my hobbies, did you?"

Liam's expression grew solemn. For the first time, the proud businessman lowered his head before another man. "I need your help finding someone. While she may no longer hold importance in my life, I must ensure her safety."

Liam had chosen Donovan precisely because of his limited connections in Eldermere and his simple lifestyle in Westhaven.

Yet Liam withheld the complete truth. With Olivia's current situation unknown, revealing too much could endanger her further.

Donovan adjusted his position, his lips curving into a polite smile while his eyes remained distant.

"I'm uncertain what's occurred," Donovan said, "but for you to seek my help - a mere business associate - speaks volumes. While I sympathize, my departure is imminent. My grandfather's condition demands my attention. And you met my cousin today? She battles a congenital heart condition."

Liam understood Donovan wasn't outright refusing. The deliberate use of "business associate" wasn't lost on him.

Without hesitation, Liam responded, "I'm aware you're expanding your operations back home. I'm prepared to offer Blackwood Enterprises' long-term partnership with your company in Eldermere."

Donovan's eyebrows lifted in surprise. "Are you certain she means so little to you?" His tone carried clear skepticism.

Donovan's modest business couldn't normally attract partnership with the mighty Blackwood empire.

He preferred organic growth over leveraging connections. Yet here stood Liam, offering an unexpected opportunity that Donovan couldn't ignore.

Pain flickered in Liam's steady gaze. "Truthfully, she's my wife. Our relationship has... deteriorated. Now she's missing. I lack the time to search personally, but I must know she's safe. If you find her, simply confirm her wellbeing. No need to return her to me."

Donovan stroked his chin thoughtfully. "Your wife? But aren't you engaged to the Hartley heiress?"

His thorough investigation of the Hartleys and Evelyn, prompted by Alistair, had revealed Liam's connection.

Liam gave a slight nod but offered no further explanation.

Donovan's opinion of Liam's character plummeted. His gaze carried undisguised contempt.

Yet he couldn't deny Liam's formidable business acumen.

Though the Blackwoods paled beside the Kensingtons, Donovan never underestimated Liam.

Having witnessed his parents' enduring love, Donovan held marriage sacred.

He despised those who abandoned their vows, though he recognized these as personal failings.

Business was business. Should he encounter Liam's unfortunate wife, he'd encourage her to leave this marriage behind.

"I'll do my best. Send her details to my assistant. But Mr. Blackwood, I must be clear - tracking isn't my expertise. Success isn't guaranteed."

Liam stood. "Understood. Whatever the outcome, I'll honor our agreement regardless."

Donovan quipped, "Shouldn't we treat today's arrangement separately from our usual dealings?"

He referred to the partnership between Blackwood Enterprises and his smaller company.

Donovan felt no gratitude - this deal might actually cost Liam financially.

With stark honesty, Liam replied, "Consider this my gratitude. I expect nothing in return."

Accepting this, Donovan signaled his staff to escort Liam out.

Watching Liam depart, Donovan pondered the man's contradictions.

How could someone so polished treat his wife so callously?

Meanwhile, Seraphina arrived at Donovan's estate. After instructing her team to monitor Olivia, she went to meet her cousin.

Fate intervened as she crossed paths with the departing Liam.

Their hospital encounter had left Seraphina convinced Liam sought Donovan's favor.

With deliberate grace, she tilted her chin up as she passed, exuding aristocratic poise.

Dressed impeccably, radiating confidence, she expected Liam's attention.

Yet just like before, Liam walked past as if she were invisible.

Unaccustomed to such disregard, Seraphina paused, shooting Liam a perplexed glance before impulsively following.

"Hello." She intercepted him, extending a perfectly manicured hand. "Visiting Donovan?"

Liam briefly shook her hand. "Yes, just concluded my business with Mr. Kensington. Good day."

With a polite nod, he moved to leave.

A frown marred Seraphina's usually composed features. How dare he ignore her?

Determined to capture his attention, she hurried after him. "As a Reeves, you deserve Donovan's respect despite his arrogance. We've only met twice, but you've made an impression. Perhaps I could assist you?"
###Chapter 225

Liam studied Seraphina's expression after her offer. The fire in her eyes dimmed slightly when he didn't immediately beg for her assistance. "I've taken care of it already. Thank you for your concern, Miss Kensington," he said coolly.

Seraphina's jaw tightened. This wasn't the reaction she'd anticipated. "There's a world of difference between you approaching Donovan and me speaking to him. My cousin might appear approachable, but he despises direct confrontation. Are you certain you don't want my intervention?"

Irritation flickered across Liam's features. He decided to be blunt. "Miss Kensington, we're strangers. Is this some sort of business proposition?"

She manufactured a sweet smile. "I simply mentioned having a favorable impression of you. Consider it a friendly gesture."

Liam's laugh held no warmth. "Miss Kensington, you misunderstand. I operate on mutual benefit. Every relationship in my world is transactional. Anything else suggests... alternative motives."

Seraphina found herself at a loss. An unfamiliar frustration bubbled within her. Was this man truly oblivious? Or simply uninterested?

She'd made the first move, for heaven's sake. Even if she wasn't his physical ideal, she was a Kensington - a name that carried weight. The Blackwoods didn't even belong in the same social stratum.

Her teeth ground together as a new scheme took shape. With calculated brightness, she smiled. "Very well, I won't impose. Might I at least have your contact details?"

Liam regarded her with detached amusement. His previous interactions with Donovan had been perfectly civil. But this cousin of his? She seemed rather... dense.

He was about to provide his business number when Evelyn's call flashed across his screen.

Liam had been deliberately distant with Evelyn lately, brushing her off with claims of being swamped with work.

She'd apparently caught on. Her calls had become incessant - a constant vibration in his pocket that grated on his already frayed nerves.

The entire Olivia situation had him twisted in knots, and Evelyn's persistent attempts at contact were the last thing he needed.

Now, watching his phone vibrate against Seraphina's predatory gaze, inspiration struck. Perhaps Evelyn could serve as a useful distraction.

The fact that Liam hadn't even saved Evelyn's number spoke volumes.

The subtle tension in Liam's expression told Seraphina this wasn't some random caller.

Never one to miss an opportunity, Seraphina pounced. "Your girlfriend?" she asked with feigned innocence.

Liam's response was curt. "Yes."

Seraphina's competitive spirit ignited. So that explained his resistance. The revelation only made him more appealing - what better challenge than stealing another woman's man? Easy conquests bored her; the thrill was in the chase.

Her lips curved into a secret smile as she plotted her next move. This game had just become infinitely more interesting.
###Chapter 226

Seraphina was just about to deliver a sharp retort when Liam abruptly interrupted. "Sharing my personal contact details isn't exactly appropriate. If you need anything, you can contact my girlfriend directly."

A flicker of irritation crossed Seraphina's features, though she quickly masked it. After all, Liam and Donovan had clearly collaborated before, which meant she'd have plenty of chances to get closer to him. This was merely the opening move in her long game.

She forced a polished smile. "Of course, that works perfectly."

Liam didn't miss the brief flash of annoyance in Seraphina's eyes. Good. Maybe she'd keep Evelyn occupied for a while and give him some much-needed breathing room.

Meanwhile, Evelyn's phone buzzed relentlessly with unanswered calls. A knot of dread tightened in her stomach. Was Liam out searching for Olivia? That didn't add up - the Hayes family had already confronted him, and he'd shown no interest in pursuing her.

Then a new notification appeared - a friend request from an unfamiliar woman's profile.

Evelyn's fingers hesitated over the screen, unease prickling down her spine.

The moment Liam extricated himself from Seraphina, he practically sprinted to his car. As the door slammed shut, his carefully maintained composure shattered. He collapsed against the leather seats, eyes squeezed shut, exhaustion carving deep lines into his face.

Sebastian studied his employer with concern. "Mr. Blackwood, you haven't slept properly since dispatching teams to locate Victor Blackwood's estate. If you continue at this pace, you'll collapse."

Liam ignored the warning, his gaze fixed on the passing cityscape. "Where the hell could Olivia be? Do you think they're hurting her? She can't even call for help." His voice cracked. "I swore to protect her, and now she's vanished again. This is all my fault. My damned arrogance blinded me to the danger."

Sebastian sighed. "With all due respect, sir, your wife lived with the Winslow family for years as their ward. Your grandfather included her in his will. Even without your involvement, she would have been dragged into this mess eventually."

Truthfully, without Liam's protection these past years, Olivia might have suffered far worse at the hands of the Winslow family.

Aside from Henry and Liam, the Winslows weren't exactly known for their kindness. For reasons no one understood, they'd always treated Olivia with particular cruelty.

Liam appreciated Sebastian's attempt to ease his guilt, but the weight of responsibility pressed down on him. He wanted to punch something - preferably his own past self for being so careless.

But losing control now wouldn't help Olivia. With visible effort, Liam straightened, the exhaustion vanishing from his expression. "Did you circulate the news as I instructed?"

Sebastian nodded quickly. "Yes, the story about your overseas treatment is spreading as planned."

"Good," Liam said tersely.

Sebastian hesitated. Previously, Liam had guarded his health condition fiercely. Why suddenly announce this very public trip abroad?
###Chapter 227

The decision puzzled Sebastian, yet his trust in Liam remained unshaken. Liam Blackwood never made mistakes - that much was certain.

Meanwhile, Olivia Sinclair enjoyed a brief respite from chaos. Though under constant surveillance, Seraphina showed no immediate intention of harming her.

Escape plans swirled in Olivia's mind, but every exit seemed barred. Perhaps running wasn't the solution. Maybe she needed to play a different game.

After careful deliberation, Olivia hatched a new strategy. She would befriend Seraphina Kensington. Gaining the woman's trust became her primary objective.

Fate smiled upon her plan - Seraphina happened to be distracted by other matters recently.

Though confined to her corner, Olivia became an attentive listener. Every whispered conversation between servants became valuable intelligence.

Within two days, Olivia had pieced together the Kensington family dynamics.

Alistair Kensington, suffering from dementia, had returned home searching for someone who remained elusive.

Donovan Kensington, the young heir, accompanied by his scheming cousin Seraphina, had joined the homecoming. Family reunion clearly wasn't Seraphina's true purpose.

Seraphina hunted - not for prey, but for a perfect specimen. Olivia had unwittingly become her captive.

Recently, a persistent problem gnawed at Seraphina like a relentless pest. Alistair's grand birthday approached, and she remained giftless. Normally, any present from her would suffice - the old man wouldn't refuse a young relative's offering. But Alistair's memory proved as unreliable as a broken clock. Half the time, he didn't even recognize his own granddaughter.

Seraphina craved to make an impression, to sear her image into Alistair's fading mind.

Olivia enjoyed limited freedom within her gilded cage - so long as she didn't attempt escape. All communication remained severed. Seraphina had ensured that. The woman showed no concern about Olivia memorizing escape routes - running would be impossible regardless.

With nothing but time, Olivia assembled the puzzle pieces. Armed with knowledge, she marched straight to Seraphina.

At that moment, Seraphina engaged in silent warfare with Evelyn Hartley. Since connecting on social media, their battle had raged. Seraphina preened like a peacock, convinced of her superior beauty and lineage.

Evelyn, however, played a different game. She weaponized her "connection" with Liam to wound Seraphina's pride. One day flaunting expensive gifts from Liam, the next hinting at romantic dinners. But Evelyn hadn't anticipated Seraphina actually rushing to the restaurant address she'd posted.

Seraphina arrived in a fury, only to discover Evelyn's deception. Fuming yet perversely satisfied, she confronted Evelyn directly.

With dripping sarcasm, Seraphina demanded how she'd missed their romantic dinner. She implied Evelyn's entire story reeked of fabrication. After all, Liam had recently visited Donovan's estate claiming work consumed him - no time for dates.
###Chapter 228

Evelyn was seething. If Seraphina wasn't some high-society princess, she would have unleashed a verbal storm that would make a pirate captain blush. Clenching her jaw, Evelyn snapped, "Listen, Liam's been working himself to the bone lately, and as his girlfriend, it's my duty to look after him."

She imagined setting an elaborate dinner table for Liam, waiting for his return. To emphasize her point, she even showed Seraphina photos of their shared meals - happy memories staring the other woman in the face.

But Seraphina, ever the bold one, didn't back down. With a smirk that could sour fresh milk, she countered, "Oh, Liam and my cousin Donovan have important business dealings. They'll certainly have many dinners together, and I'll definitely be joining them."

The audacity! Seraphina even had the nerve to ask Evelyn about Liam's food allergies or dietary preferences for their future meals. This was a new low for Evelyn, who was used to being the taker, never the one being taken from.

Though Seraphina appeared victorious, irritation simmered beneath her composed exterior. Just as her temper threatened to boil over, she spotted Olivia standing by the doorway.

Seraphina's eyes narrowed dangerously. "What do you want?"

Olivia strolled in, fingers dancing across her phone screen. "Listen up, Miss Kensington. I'm here to propose a deal."

Seraphina scoffed, her laughter dripping with sarcasm. "Are you even aware of your current situation, Olivia? You think you're in any position to negotiate with me?"

Unshaken by the venomous tone, Olivia kept typing. "I'm pregnant, and this baby deserves the best. That's where you come in. I heard you're struggling with your grandfather's birthday gift. He appreciates fine craftsmanship, doesn't he? I can help you create something special."

Seraphina's lips twisted in contempt. "Do I look like a fool to you?" she spat. "I could easily buy whatever I want. Hell, I could commission a replica. Why on earth would I need your help?"

Olivia remained composed. "Because reputation matters to you. If there were better options, you'd have taken them already."

Despite Seraphina's delicate appearance, Olivia saw fierce determination burning in her eyes. This wasn't someone who could be easily manipulated - her pride was clearly at stake.

The Kensingtons were Eldermere royalty. Wealth flowed through their veins, and their name commanded respect, even though they weren't directly involved in local businesses.

In a family that practically worshipped exquisite craftsmanship, a cheap imitation would never suffice. Every Kensington had an expert eye, and Seraphina would rather die than present anything less than perfection.

Olivia wasn't playing games. Her request was reasonable, all things considered.

Her fingers flew across the screen. "Look him up yourself."

Following Olivia's direction, Seraphina found Gregory's studio profile.

The first thing that caught her attention was a pinned video showcasing the very gift Olivia had made during her apprenticeship. While her skills weren't refined back then, Gregory had cherished it nonetheless.

###Chapter 229

Months had slipped by since Olivia's appearance in the studio, yet the video persisted. Not just lingered, but was prominently featured at the top of Gregory's page.

Tears shimmered in Olivia's eyes as she tapped the phone screen. "I once studied under Gregory. Some of my early works might still be there. Feel free to verify. My craftsmanship speaks for itself, and you're welcome to judge with your own eyes."

Seraphina's gaze sharpened, a flicker of surprise crossing her features. "Gregory Thornton?" Her lips curled into a sly smirk. "How unexpectedly... interesting."

The name lingered between them as Seraphina studied Olivia with newfound interest. She recalled Alistair mentioning Gregory - how he'd always intended to pay the master craftsman a proper visit. When Alistair Kensington praised someone, it meant something. Seraphina never forgot names that impressed her grandfather.

Olivia lowered her eyes with a wistful smile. "I only apprenticed briefly. He's probably forgotten me by now. Not that I have anyone to remind him." Her fingers twisted in her lap. "No family. No connections."

Something shifted in Seraphina's expression, her gaze softening marginally. "Is that so?"

Improving Olivia's living conditions required minimal effort from Seraphina. Her current obsession was Liam, though love hadn't entered the equation yet. It was pure competitive instinct - the more he resisted, the more determined she became. Like a cat toying with a particularly elusive mouse.

With someone else handling the gift for Alistair, Seraphina agreed readily. A faint smile played on her lips. "Very well, you'll handle this. Impress me, and you'll be rewarded. Stay obedient, and I might just treat you kindly. Understood?"

Olivia forced a grateful smile, playing the role of indebted servant perfectly. Seraphina thrived on such displays of submission.

"Remember our arrangement." Seraphina's voice turned icy. "Fail me, and you'll regret it. My patience wears thin these days."

Olivia nodded obediently.

Materials arrived that evening. Olivia hoped for time to perfect the design, but Seraphina demanded immediate results.

With a resigned sigh, Olivia prepared for a sleepless night. By midnight, she sent the completed design to Seraphina's device.

To her surprise, Seraphina actually woke to review it. After a cursory glance, the response came swift and cutting: "Lackluster. Make it more extravagant."

Seraphina insisted the gift needed boldness, not timid elegance. Among the materials provided, only the jade met her exacting standards. Wood lacked sophistication, gemstones screamed vulgarity. But jade - durable yet delicate - would leave its mark on any craftsman's hands.

Olivia exhaled sharply, frustration simmering beneath her calm exterior. In another life, she'd have refused such an unreasonable client. But circumstances had changed irrevocably.

Her hand drifted to her abdomen, where a subtle curve pressed against her thin blouse. Four months along, and though her frame remained slender, the life within grew more pronounced daily. When she pressed her palm against the gentle swell, warmth radiated through her fingertips - a silent conversation with the tiny being she carried.
###Chapter 230

Olivia took a shuddering breath, steeling herself for the gamble. What did she have left to lose anyway? Things were already at rock bottom.

Her fingers ached from hours of relentless sketching, each stroke infused with desperate determination. When Seraphina finally snatched the fifth draft from her hands, the paper slapped against Olivia's cheek with stinging force. "This is utter garbage! If you can't even draw properly, why bother taking commissions?"

Dark smudges shadowed Olivia's eyes like bruises after sleepless nights. The insults burned, but she clenched her jaw and remained silent. Without protest, she produced another sketch from her portfolio.

Seraphina's gaze flickered over the new design. "Hmph. This one's passable. So you do have some talent after all. Consider this the final version. Get it finished before Grandfather's birthday gala - or face the consequences."

Crossing her legs with deliberate slowness, Seraphina's lips curled in a smirk that didn't reach her eyes. The irony tasted bitter in Olivia's mouth - the second design she'd created was nearly identical to the first rejected one. Seraphina's approval seemed as fickle as the wind, entirely dependent on her mercurial moods. And today, she was clearly in a spectacularly foul temper.

Earlier that afternoon, upon hearing Liam was visiting Donovan again, Seraphina had rushed to his study in full glamour mode. The guards barred her entry - business discussions in progress, no disturbances permitted unless urgent.

She'd even faked a fainting spell to gain access. The entire performance proved pointless. The moment Liam saw her, he announced his departure. When Seraphina claimed sudden recovery and offered to escort him out, Donovan suggested calling a physician instead. Not a single word passed between Seraphina and Liam during the entire farce.

No man had ever treated Seraphina with such blatant disregard, not even after learning her family name. Her private investigation into Evelyn Hartley revealed nothing extraordinary - average looks, shallow personality. Why would Liam prefer such mediocrity over her?

The more Seraphina obsessed, the tighter the knot of frustration twisted in her chest. Spotting Olivia still hovering nearby, her simmering rage found a new target.

Storming forward, Seraphina loomed over the quiet designer. Olivia kept her eyes downcast, the picture of submission, while turmoil churned beneath her calm surface.

Suddenly, Seraphina understood why Olivia unnerved her so. There was something in the woman's composed demeanor that mirrored Liam's - that same quiet intensity, the polite distance that felt impenetrable. Where Liam's aloofness stoked Seraphina's desire to conquer, Olivia's similar bearing grated like sandpaper on raw skin.

She could tolerate Liam's indifference, but from a purchased servant? Unacceptable.

Under Seraphina's venomous stare, Olivia's fingers trembled as she fumbled for her phone. "Miss Kensington, if the materials meet your approval, I'll take my leave now."

Before Seraphina could respond, Olivia turned toward the door. A manicured hand shot out, blocking her escape with terrifying finality.
###Chapter 231

"Wait just a moment," Seraphina said, her lips curling into a deceptively sweet smile. It was the same practiced expression she'd worn when they first met. With her angelic features and cascading golden locks, Seraphina Kensington looked every bit the picture of innocence. The delicate bangs framing her face only enhanced her cherubic appearance.

Such beauty could deceive anyone at first glance.

But Olivia Sinclair knew better. That saccharine smile always preceded trouble - dark, twisted trouble that slithered in like a poisonous fog. A cold dread coiled in Olivia's stomach, tightening with each passing second.

"You know," Seraphina purred, reaching out with perfectly manicured fingers, "I never noticed before, but you're actually quite lovely." Her cold fingertips grazed Olivia's cheek.

Olivia suppressed a shudder. The touch felt like a viper's caress, sending icy tendrils down her spine.

She hadn't bothered with cosmetics lately. While her features weren't conventionally perfect, there was an arresting quality to her bone structure - especially those large, expressive eyes. Olivia's gaze could melt hearts with its softness, but right now, only glacial hardness reflected back at Seraphina.

Seraphina clicked her tongue in annoyance. That familiar glint in Olivia's eyes unsettled her more than she cared to admit.

Forcing concern into her voice, Seraphina continued, "Pregnancy really does take its toll, doesn't it? You've lost that spark in your eyes." She gestured dramatically. "But fortune smiles upon you! My special tonics just arrived today. Consider this my gift to you."

One of Seraphina's sycophants immediately chimed in, "These are made with the rarest ingredients! You should be groveling with gratitude!"

Olivia's stomach churned. This was bad. Her fingers trembled as she typed on her phone: "Thank you for your generosity, Miss Kensington, but I've already taken my prescribed medication. Mixing treatments could be dangerous. I wouldn't want your kindness to have unintended consequences."

Seraphina's smile turned razor-sharp. "For a mute little mouse, you certainly know how to sweet-talk. Listen carefully - you'll take this medicine, or I'll take it as a personal insult."

With a snap of her fingers, a maid scurried in bearing an ornate jar. The moment the lid was removed, a pungent medicinal stench filled the room.

Morning sickness had already left Olivia's stomach in knots. Now, the overpowering odor made her insides twist violently.

Olivia knew Seraphina wouldn't dare outright poison her - but God only knew what concoction this was. Drinking it could have disastrous consequences.

Swallowing her pride, Olivia dropped to her knees. Her fingers flew across the screen: "Miss Kensington, whatever offense I've caused, I sincerely apologize. Please reconsider - I must finish your grandfather's birthday gift. I beg you not to force this upon me."

Seraphina studied Olivia in silence before letting out a derisive laugh. "Fine, forget it then."

Relief flooded Olivia's veins - until she saw the malicious glint in Seraphina's eyes. This wasn't over. Not by a long shot.

###Chapter 232

Seraphina Kensington's lips curled into a cruel smile. "Since you seem so fond of kneeling, by all means, stay right there on your knees."

Olivia Sinclair's face turned ashen. The marble floor beneath her offered no cushion, no mercy - just unrelenting hardness. She had to cradle her swollen belly carefully. Pregnancy had brought more than just anticipation; it came with relentless backaches, and now a dull throbbing radiated through her lower body.

Cold sweat trickled down Olivia's spine despite her efforts to endure. Tears welled in her eyes as she gazed up at Seraphina, silently begging for mercy. But Seraphina merely stretched lazily. "The sedatives are making me drowsy. I need my beauty sleep. Watch her for me, won't you? Since she refused my medicine, she must be feeling quite robust. A few hours kneeling won't kill her."

Despair settled over Olivia as she closed her eyes, praying her unborn child would stay safe. Yet within the hour, the pain became unbearable. Her entire body trembled, drenched in sweat as if she'd been submerged in ice water.

Frantic, Olivia scanned the room for help. But her phone - her lifeline - had been taken. The servants surrounding her exchanged malicious glances, their whispers laced with venom.

"Not feeling well, princess? Use your words," one taunted with false concern.

"Still silent? Must be handling it just fine then," another chimed in.

"Look at her - she practically thrives on suffering," a third observed with a smirk.

"If she enjoys it so much, who are we to interfere?" Their laughter echoed through the grand hall like shattering glass.

Olivia inhaled sharply, bracing herself against the cold floor with trembling hands. Once, such cruelty from other women would have shattered her. Now, something inside her had shifted irrevocably.

Tears mixed with sweat as they hit the polished marble, each drop reflecting Olivia's distorted image back at her. The woman staring back wasn't broken - her eyes burned with something far more dangerous than pain. A lifetime of suppressed fury had finally reached its boiling point.

They'd stolen her voice in that accident, taken everything from her. Yet the torment never ceased. Even mute, Olivia's mind churned with vengeance. The metallic taste of blood filled her mouth as she bit down hard, refusing to lift her head in submission.

But her tormentors weren't finished. Their amusement waned when she didn't react, and they exchanged knowing looks. Long accustomed to Seraphina's brand of cruelty, they'd learned all her tricks. Beneath that angelic facade lurked something truly monstrous.

Without warning, a crushing weight slammed into Olivia's back, sending white-hot pain radiating through her spine.

"Enjoying yourself down there?" came the sneer.

"Can't even kneel properly? Need lessons in humility?" another voice jeered.

The blows continued, each more vicious than the last. Olivia's vision blurred, but through the haze, one thought crystallized - this would not be forgotten. Every insult, every cruelty would be repaid tenfold. The game had just begun.
###Chapter 233

Pushed beyond endurance and physically drained, Olivia's knees buckled beneath her. Just as darkness threatened to claim her consciousness, the door burst open with a sharp crack. A commanding male voice sliced through the tension, "Explain this disgraceful scene immediately!"

The crushing weight on Olivia's shoulders disappeared as she gasped for air, collapsing onto the marble floor in complete exhaustion. The household staff froze mid-action, their faces paling at Donovan Kensington's unexpected arrival with his entourage.

Upstairs, Seraphina slept undisturbed in her chambers. Everyone knew about the young mistress's fragile health and her notorious temper when awakened prematurely. The consequences were always severe.

There had been an incident in Westhaven when a clumsy maid dropped a silver tray during Seraphina's afternoon nap. The next morning, the girl disappeared from the estate - her arms broken, her future uncertain. The current servants exchanged terrified glances, none daring to risk their mistress's wrath.

Thinking quickly, the head maid yanked Olivia up with false cheer, addressing Donovan with forced brightness. "Mr. Kensington, Miss Kensington is resting. We were just... engaging in some harmless fun."

But Olivia's legs, numb from hours of kneeling, gave out again. This time, she deliberately pulled the head maid down with her, using the woman as a human cushion. Though slender, Olivia's pregnant form carried surprising weight as she landed squarely on the maid's midsection.

A pained shriek echoed through the hall - sweet revenge for earlier humiliations. The pinned maid opened her mouth to curse Olivia but snapped it shut under Donovan's withering glare.

With a derisive snort, Donovan observed, "Harmless fun? Do you take me for a fool?"

Olivia scrambled to her feet, retreating to the shadows with bowed head. She recognized Donovan from their brief hospital encounter - Seraphina's cousin and closest ally. If he shared his cousin's cruel tendencies, Olivia knew she'd be in even greater danger.

Donovan's piercing gaze swept over Olivia, studying her from head to toe. Her face seemed vaguely familiar, but it was her eyes - filled with quiet defiance despite her obvious suffering - that captured his attention. The sight of her swollen belly stirred an unexpected protectiveness within him. "Summon Seraphina. Now," he commanded.

Terror flashed across the servants' faces as they shuffled nervously, each hoping another would volunteer for the suicidal mission.

Finally, Olivia straightened her shoulders and marched toward Seraphina's chambers without hesitation. The moment she opened the door, the sounds of shattering porcelain and muffled slaps echoed through the corridor.

When Olivia reappeared moments later, her expression remained carefully blank. Behind her stormed a furious Seraphina - until she spotted Donovan waiting in the hall. Instantly, her features softened into an angelic mask, her eyelashes fluttering with practiced innocence.
###Chapter 234

"Donovan, what brings you here? I wasn't expecting you. Just taking some time to myself." Seraphina's voice was light, but her sharp gaze swept over the servants like a blade.

She showed no intention of targeting Olivia. The young woman exhaled quietly in relief and melted further into the background.

Watching Olivia's cautious retreat, Donovan felt a pang of confusion. He'd come prepared to defend her, yet her submissive demeanor disappointed him. She seemed resigned to her fate.

Assuming Olivia lacked backbone, Donovan abandoned his protective impulse. He turned to Seraphina with cool detachment. "I came to discuss Grandfather's upcoming birthday. He's turning seventy, but with most relatives abroad, we've agreed on simplicity. You'll handle the arrangements while Grandfather and I search for our missing cousin."

Seraphina's eyes lit up at the chance to host such an event - the perfect opportunity to showcase her talents. Yet the thought of actual work made her hesitate. "Perhaps I shouldn't have come back," she murmured.

Noticing Donovan's darkening expression, she quickly corrected course. "But I understand. Finding our cousin takes priority. Leave the party to me."

Donovan's features softened slightly as he nodded. Rising to leave, he paused at the doorway. "Remember Grandfather's temper. No repeats of today's behavior. We're not in Westhaven anymore - break the law here, and even I can't protect you."

Seraphina scoffed. "Who would dare cross the Kensingtons?"

Donovan fixed her with a stern look. After a tense moment, Seraphina beckoned Olivia forward. "Come here, Olivia. Tell Donovan - did anyone mistreat you today?"

Olivia kept her eyes downcast, exhaustion evident in every line of her body. She shook her head silently.

Donovan frowned at her continued silence. How could she remain so passive after being wronged? But it wasn't his concern. He had greater priorities - not just locating their cousin, but also tracking down someone for Liam.

The fact that Liam hadn't even provided a photo, claiming it was "inconvenient," struck Donovan as suspicious. He'd never encountered such vague instructions before. It reeked of excuses.

Shaking off these thoughts, Donovan departed. The moment he left, the servant who'd tormented Olivia most viciously began complaining. "Miss Kensington, did you see how Olivia played the victim for Mr. Kensington? Running to him like some obedient dog when he called, completely ignoring your orders—"

Her words ended in a sharp cry as Seraphina's hand connected with her cheek. The servant collapsed to her knees, eyes wide with terror at her mistress's fury.
###Chapter 235

"Why didn't you dare wake me sooner? If it wasn't for Olivia, Donovan would have humiliated me beyond repair. What's wrong? Am I too intimidating? Or did my temper frighten you away?" Seraphina's voice thundered through the grand hallway.

Humiliation burned through Seraphina's veins after Donovan's public rebuke. She needed an outlet for her rage, and Olivia had been the perfect target. Yet the quiet way Olivia had absorbed the abuse while secretly diffusing the situation only infuriated Seraphina more. This newcomer displayed more intelligence than all her long-serving staff combined. Why couldn't any of them show half that cleverness?

Exhaustion weighed Olivia down as she kept her gaze lowered, ignoring Seraphina's tirade against the trembling maid. The scene brought her no satisfaction. She understood the real source of this storm. "May I be excused to rest?" Olivia requested softly.

This time, Seraphina granted permission, though her parting words carried a razor's edge. "Don't forget how little time remains. Fail me, and you'll regret it deeply."

Olivia nodded once before turning away without hesitation.

Meanwhile, Donovan had barely settled into his study when Liam's email arrived. The attached photograph of Liam's wife made Donovan's breath catch. The resemblance was uncanny—how could this radiant woman share features with the broken soul he'd seen at Seraphina's estate?

Yet differences emerged upon closer inspection. The woman in the photo smiled with genuine warmth, her eyes sparkling with life and beauty. The woman at Seraphina's had been a shadow of this image—hollow-eyed, bitter, drained of vitality. Why would Liam's wife choose to remain with Seraphina? Hadn't his cousin described her as some pitiful charity case?

Puzzlement gnawed at Donovan as he summoned his butler. "Inform Seraphina I require her new attendant. There's a matter I wish to discuss with her personally."

But Seraphina refused point-blank. Not only did she deny the request, but Olivia was immediately reassigned to distant quarters.

When Donovan confronted her again, Seraphina's eyes narrowed with suspicion. "Donovan, since when do you covet what's mine? She's far too valuable to me. Are you attempting to steal her away?"

Donovan's expression remained impassive, though a frown creased his brow. "Why would I want her? There's simply something familiar about her."

A flicker of panic crossed Seraphina's face. "You've met before?"

Donovan's response came laced with manufactured outrage. "Indeed! During my overseas trip six months ago, someone robbed me. I've been trying to place her face—the thief bore a striking resemblance."

Most of Seraphina's suspicions evaporated at this explanation. Donovan's highly publicized theft during his travels lent credibility to his claim. Anticipating her doubt, Donovan produced carefully altered surveillance images where the thief's face had been digitally replaced with Olivia's features.

The fabricated evidence served its purpose perfectly. Seraphina couldn't know the photos had been doctored, making Donovan's interest appear entirely justified.

###Chapter 236

To ease Seraphina's lingering suspicions, Donovan added with deliberate casualness, "Didn't I mention we should thoroughly vet everyone in this household? I don't mean to accuse, but perhaps it's best to remove her immediately."

Her defenses softening, Seraphina responded with practiced warmth, "She's had such a difficult past - a true survivor of the streets. Under my care, she's turning her life around. Surely she deserves another chance? Whatever she took from you, I'll personally reimburse."

"Forget about it," Donovan muttered through clenched teeth. "Just ensure I never have to lay eyes on her again. The very sight of her makes my blood boil."

Maintaining her serene smile, Seraphina watched Donovan storm from her chambers. The moment the door clicked shut, his shoulders slumped with exhaustion. What game was his cousin playing? He prayed his darkest suspicions were unfounded, yet the situation grew more tangled by the hour.

Winston, his trusted butler, furrowed his brow. "Why not simply take the girl by force? Lady Kensington may scheme, but she still fears your authority."

Donovan gave a bitter chuckle. "With her fragile heart condition? Direct confrontation could be deadly. We must tread carefully. Still, our little test proved revealing - the moment you questioned her, she hid that girl away. Imagine what lengths she might go to if pressed further. At least now we know where our quarry is hidden."

Alistair's birthday celebration arrived with alarming swiftness. Olivia had completed her intricate gift the previous evening, presenting it to Seraphina for approval.

"Exquisite craftsmanship," Seraphina purred, tracing the delicate filigree. "Such refined skill suggests extensive training. Your connection with Gregory must run quite... deep." Though her words dripped honey, her piercing gaze held darker implications as she studied Olivia's reaction.

Olivia's fingers flew across her phone screen in explanation. "I only studied under Gregory briefly. He likely doesn't recall my existence."

"Is that so?" Seraphina arched one perfectly shaped eyebrow before turning away, leaving the unspoken question hanging in the air.

Preparations for Alistair's gala consumed Seraphina's attention. After final adjustments to her appearance, she swept into Crestwood's most luxurious hotel - a venue she'd secured in its entirety. Even Henry Winslow's legendary birthday celebration years prior had only warranted the penthouse floors.

Donovan believed a modest, intimate gathering would have been more appropriate. News of Seraphina's extravagance left him speechless with rage.

His assistant leaned in discreetly. "Lady Kensington has invited every notable family in Crestwood, including those with no prior connection to our household. This feels less like Master Alistair's celebration and more like her personal debut."

Donovan ground his molars. "If my schedule weren't overflowing, I'd never have allowed this farce. But the invitations are dispatched - we're committed now." He massaged his temples. "While the Kensington name carries weight abroad, our local connections remain tenuous. One misstep could offend powerful allies."

The assistant offered empty reassurance. "None would dare cross the Kensington family, sir."

Donovan's sigh carried the weight of generations. "You see only our gilded surface. The reality is far more precarious. Ensure our staff avoids conflict with the Blackwoods, and if opportunity arises, cultivate ties with the Whitmores."

His eyes hardened. "Seraphina's spectacle will undoubtedly create chaos... chaos we can exploit to locate our missing person."

A calculated smile played across his lips as the first carriages arrived, their polished wheels glinting in the afternoon sun. The game was afoot.
###Chapter 237

The assistant gave a quick nod. "Consider it done."

Just as the assistant turned to leave, a sudden realization made him hesitate. "Miss Kensington has invited Liam from the Blackwood family. Should I arrange a private meeting for you? I'm concerned about how Miss Kensington might receive him."

"Seraphina actually invited Liam?" Donovan felt his stomach drop. His voice tightened as he asked, "Did she include Evelyn in the invitation?"

"No, she didn't." The assistant shook his head.

Everything clicked into place for Donovan. Inviting Liam alone spoke volumes. He should have recognized the pattern - every time Liam visited the Kensington estate, Seraphina became unusually animated.

Donovan had previously warned his cousin about Liam's obvious preference for Evelyn, making her pursuit futile. His sources confirmed Liam remained cold toward Seraphina.

Under normal circumstances, Donovan would have expected Seraphina to move on. Yet here she was, pushing boundaries further than ever before.

"Double the surveillance team," Donovan ordered, rubbing his temples. "I want immediate reports of any incidents."

Meanwhile, Seraphina was putting the finishing touches on her appearance after confirming all her guests would attend.

With her usual glam squad overseas, she'd hastily assembled the best local stylists money could buy. Her custom couture gown had been flown in specially for the occasion. The final result was breathtaking.

Chin lifted regally, Seraphina made her grand entrance, the train of her dress flowing behind her. She descended the grand staircase with practiced grace, savoring the admiring whispers.

While not classically beautiful, Seraphina carried herself with the unmistakable poise of old money. Her every movement reflected generations of elite breeding and exclusive education. Even those unfamiliar with the Kensington name recognized her aristocratic bearing instantly.

A crowd immediately formed around her, offering fawning compliments. Seraphina accepted their admiration with practiced charm, her smile never wavering.

Then a servant approached discreetly. "Miss, Mr. Blackwood has arrived."

Seraphina's pulse quickened. She was about to call out to Liam when she noticed the woman at his side.

To her shock, it was Evelyn - the one person she'd deliberately excluded from the guest list.

Seraphina's smile turned brittle. She shot a venomous look at the servant, who stammered, "We only sent one invitation, miss. I don't know how she got in."

Seraphina's nails dug into her palms. There stood Evelyn beside Liam, radiating confidence. She held a small plate, offering Liam what appeared to be hors d'oeuvres. Liam remained impassive, his gaze fixed ahead, yet he allowed Evelyn closer than anyone else.

The intimate scene made Seraphina's blood boil. Gathering her skirts, she marched toward them with determined steps. Hearing her approach, Evelyn looked up, meeting Seraphina's glare with calm amusement.

The air between them crackled with tension.

Neither woman blinked.

The crowd around them fell silent, sensing the impending storm.
###Chapter 238

Observing Seraphina's reaction, Evelyn asked with deliberate casualness, "Miss Kensington, are you displeased to see me here?"

Evelyn continued, her voice laced with subtle mockery, "You might not be aware, but your family extended an invitation to me personally. While you had no intention of including me, your cousin thought otherwise."

Seraphina let out a sharp laugh, her tone cutting. "How charitable of my cousin. Though I notice Liam didn't go out of his way to secure your invitation, did he?"

Evelyn's face darkened as she struggled for a response. She shot an accusatory glance at Liam standing beside her. Liam, seemingly oblivious to her look, cleared his throat impatiently. "I have business to attend to. Entertain Miss Kensington as you wish."

His indifference extended equally to both women, his demeanor remaining unreadable.

As Liam walked away, Evelyn watched his retreating figure, lowering her gaze to hide the disappointment in her eyes. She'd noticed Liam had grown noticeably colder recently. While he still indulged her whims as always, the warmth had vanished from his gaze, replaced by an icy detachment that chilled her to the core.

A pathetic thought crossed Evelyn's mind - Liam's smiles had seemed more genuine when Olivia was around. Though she recognized the absurdity of this observation, the truth of it stung. Still, she clung to the reassurance that, according to recent reports, Olivia would never return.

Seraphina regarded Evelyn with open disdain. "Miss Hartley, if I were in your position, I wouldn't have shown my face here. You're only inviting humiliation."

Evelyn's anger flared. Never had she encountered someone so brazenly shameless.

She fixed Seraphina with a venomous glare. "Miss Kensington, are you truly so desperate to steal another woman's man? Aren't you concerned about becoming the laughingstock of high society?"

A smirk played on Seraphina's lips as if she'd heard an uproarious joke. "And who, pray tell, would dare laugh at me?"

Evelyn found herself speechless. The stark contrast between her modest background and Seraphina's aristocratic lineage couldn't be more apparent. Seraphina was everything Evelyn wasn't - accomplished, breathtakingly beautiful, the jewel of elite society. In another life, without Liam between them, Evelyn might have sought her friendship. Yet here they stood, rivals in love.

Despite her insecurities, Evelyn held her ground. "This is wrong. Can't you see Liam wants nothing to do with you? He avoids you at every opportunity. I wouldn't chase after someone so clearly uninterested if I were you."

Seraphina closed the distance between them. "For now, perhaps. But who knows what the future holds? Consider this - why would Liam consistently pursue collaborations with my cousin if he merely wished to avoid suspicion for your sake? I've examined their business dealings closely. Every single venture results in financial loss for Liam."

She leaned closer, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "Liam Blackwood isn't the type to curry favor so transparently. So ask yourself - what truly motivates his interest in the Kensington family? Even if not for me alone, he's clearly angling to ingratiate himself with my entire family. And I'm the only one who can truly help him."

Evelyn felt the air leave her lungs. These were precisely the questions that haunted her, the fears she couldn't voice. She'd confronted Liam before, but his responses were always curt. "I have my reasons. You wouldn't understand."

The unspoken words hung between them, heavier than any spoken accusation.
###Chapter 239

Evelyn's doubts lingered like shadows at dusk. Yet when Seraphina voiced them aloud, Evelyn's temper flared crimson. Her jaw tightened as she snapped, "Regardless, I'm the one by his side now. That alone proves my victory."

Seraphina's response came with eerie composure. "I remember Liam has a wife. Yet you inserted yourself between them and stole him away. If such actions were possible for you, why not for me? When you shattered their marriage vows, did his wedding ring give you pause?"

"You!" Rage propelled Evelyn's hand forward, but Donovan's bodyguard intercepted the strike mid-air.

Watching Evelyn's fury, Seraphina coolly instructed her guards, "Miss Hartley appears distressed. She requires rest."

As the guards escorted her away, Evelyn fought against the humiliation. Her once-perfect curls tumbled loose, her designer gown wrinkled beyond recognition. The weight of spectators' gazes burned her skin with shame and fury. Never had she endured such public disgrace.

Natalie observed from nearby, lips curling in sardonic amusement. She'd never anticipated seeing Evelyn so thoroughly humiliated. No one would fault Seraphina for pursuing Liam - the handsome, powerful CEO attracted admirers like moths to flame. Moreover, the Kensington name carried far more prestige than the Hartleys.

The injustices Olivia had suffered were now revisiting Evelyn in twisted reflection - poetic justice indeed. Yet thoughts of the missing Olivia brought stinging tears to Natalie's eyes. Two weeks had passed without word of the pregnant woman's whereabouts. The helplessness gnawed at Natalie's composure.

Evelyn's choked sobs filled the air briefly before intervention came.

"What's happening here?" Donovan arrived with his entourage, immediately sensing the tension. His expression darkened like storm clouds. The bodyguards released Evelyn only when they registered Donovan's displeasure.

Rubbing her reddened wrist, Evelyn shot Seraphina a venomous glare. Seraphina, meeting Donovan's disapproving look, felt momentary guilt but stood her ground. "Donovan, you placed me in charge here. Everyone witnessed her attempt to strike me. I showed restraint by not having such ill-mannered guests removed immediately."

Evelyn gaped at Seraphina's distorted account. She turned desperately to Donovan. "Mr. Kensington, she provoked me first about my relationship with Liam—"

"Miss Hartley." Donovan cut her off sharply. While not defending Seraphina, he remained acutely aware of their audience and the gossip this could spawn.

Forcing a diplomatic smile, Donovan shifted topics. "Thank you for attending my grandfather's celebration. You haven't greeted him yet, have you? He mentioned remembering you fondly from previous meetings. Would you accompany me? Your presence would mean much - familiar faces aid his memory during recovery."

Evelyn's mood brightened instantly. "He truly remembers me? And favorably?"

"Indeed." Donovan nodded. "Would you join me?"

"Certainly," Evelyn replied, confidence restored.
###Chapter 240

Evelyn understood the gravity of this opportunity. This was her moment to establish ties with the prestigious Kensington family, just as Olivia had done with the Whitmores. Though Evelyn had once criticized Olivia's methods, she now recognized their brilliance. If she could become an honored guest of the Kensingtons, she wondered how Seraphina would dare treat her then.

At these words, Seraphina's panic surged. She grabbed Donovan's arm and pulled him aside. "Donovan, have you lost your mind? You know perfectly well—"

"That's precisely why I did it." Donovan's voice carried heavy disappointment as he rubbed his temples. "I've been too distracted lately to notice your actions. I never imagined you'd go this far. Have you considered how this affects our family? What you're doing is clearly unethical."

Seraphina scoffed. "Ethics? Evelyn seduced Liam away from his wife first. Why can't I play the same game?"

Donovan's headache intensified as disappointment flashed in his eyes. The sweet, well-behaved girl he remembered had become this? He regretted not intervening sooner.

If only Alistair had raised Seraphina with his strict principles. But when her parents returned, they'd immediately reclaimed custody. Over time, her moral compass had become completely distorted.

Donovan's grip tightened on Seraphina's wrist, his voice laced with warning. "Just because others lack morals doesn't mean you should too. I've indulged you too long. Continue down this path, and I'll have no choice but to send you away."

Seraphina met his threat with an icy glare. "My parents and brother would never speak to me like this. You've changed, Donovan. Now all you care about is that missing cousin. Why waste energy on someone who's probably dead?"

Donovan's hand twitched as if to strike. "Say that again and it won't just be words."

Noticing the watching crowd, Seraphina lowered her head in false submission. "I understand."

Donovan saw through the act but let it pass. As he turned to leave, Seraphina stopped him urgently. "Wait—you said Grandfather met Evelyn? And approves of her? Is this true?"

Donovan nodded. "Yes. Someone returned him to us. When I found him, he kept saying he'd found our missing cousin. My investigation suggests Evelyn brought him back. Since Grandfather is the only one who knew our aunt and cousin, if he believes it's her..." He trailed off meaningfully.

Seraphina's eyes widened in disbelief. "But Evelyn has parents! Our aunt and uncle died years ago. There must be some mistake."

The possibility that Evelyn might be their long-lost relative made Seraphina's previous hostility seem ridiculous. Worse, she'd have to address Evelyn as "cousin"—an unbearable thought.

Noticing her turmoil, Donovan added quietly, "I suggest you stop antagonizing Evelyn. If we're reunited and she seeks retribution, I won't interfere."
###Chapter 241

Seraphina Kensington clenched her jaw, frustration radiating from every tense muscle in her body. Yet she could do nothing but watch as Donovan Kensington went to fetch Evelyn Hartley.

Donovan had undoubtedly shared every detail with Evelyn. The smug satisfaction on Evelyn's face was unmistakable, her confidence evident in every calculated step. She even threw Seraphina a triumphant glance that only deepened Seraphina's contempt.

It seemed Evelyn was more than willing to sever all ties with the Hartley family, eagerly abandoning them to curry favor with the Kensingtons. Donovan and Alistair would be fools to embrace Evelyn without seeing through her scheming nature.

Seraphina realized pleading would get her nowhere. As Donovan escorted Evelyn away, a sharp pang of distress gripped her chest. Her eyes glinted with icy determination.

Despite everything, Seraphina took comfort in knowing the gift she'd asked Olivia Sinclair to meticulously prepare would make an impact. She reassured herself that once her health was restored, she wouldn't need to fear people like Donovan and Evelyn anymore. This thought smoothed the tension from her expression.

Meanwhile, Olivia stirred awake, roused by muffled voices outside. Pregnancy had disrupted her sleep patterns, leaving her perpetually exhausted. Even with extended daytime rest, fatigue clung to her like a second skin. Thankfully, Seraphina had kept her promise, ensuring Olivia received proper prenatal care and nutrition.

Lately, Seraphina had been preoccupied with organizing Alistair's birthday celebration, leaving little attention for Olivia. Yet Olivia knew this calm was temporary. She couldn't decipher Seraphina's true intentions.

As Olivia's anxiety grew, the voices outside became clearer.

"Why waste time watching her? Let's just enjoy the party."

"But those are Miss Kensington's orders. If anything happens, we're responsible."

"What's there to worry about? Haven't you seen how cozy she is with Seraphina? She's living better than ever - why would she leave?"

The envy in their tone was palpable.

Hearing them describe her "fortunate" situation, Olivia nearly laughed at the irony. Her current comfort came at the price of future uncertainty. No one knew what dangers lay ahead.

The debate outside continued until, after much deliberation, they finally decided to leave, abandoning their watch over Olivia.

As their footsteps faded, Olivia's pulse quickened. Her chance to escape was finally within reach.

Meanwhile, Donovan led Evelyn to Alistair's private quarters. The elderly man sat at a grand piano, completely absorbed in his playing, his back to the newcomers. Music remained Alistair's sole passion these days.

Evelyn immediately began showering him with praise. "Is that your grandfather? His playing is magnificent. I once knew a professional pianist, but your grandfather's talent far surpasses his." Donovan couldn't help but smirk at her transparent flattery, his voice laced with frost. "That piece was composed by my grandfather specifically for his beloved daughter. Miss Hartley, I'm surprised you claim to have heard it elsewhere."

Realizing her blunder, Evelyn offered an awkward smile and fell silent. Just then, Alistair stopped playing. Only then did Donovan approach his grandfather with a warm smile. "Grandfather, this is Miss Hartley. Does she look familiar to you? Could she be the one you've been searching for?"
###Chapter 242

Evelyn managed to keep her voice barely above a whisper. "Hello, Alistair. I heard we've met before. Do you remember where?"

At that moment, Alistair turned to face Evelyn, his piercing gaze like winter frost. The practiced smile on Evelyn's lips froze instantly, panic flashing in her widened eyes. This couldn't be happening - wasn't this the supposedly deaf elderly man she'd deliberately chosen to mock Olivia because of his disability? How could she have known this very man was Alistair Kensington of the powerful Kensington family?

Suddenly, everything clicked into place for Evelyn, especially why Alistair had told Donovan he was "impressed" with her. After what she'd done to him, how could he not be?

A cold shiver of terror ran down Evelyn's spine. Donovan remained oblivious to her strange reaction, his attention solely focused on his grandfather. Studying Alistair's expression carefully, Donovan only saw the old man giving Evelyn that same detached, icy stare he reserved for complete strangers.

Seeing Alistair's glacial gaze directed at Evelyn, Donovan assumed his grandfather was having another episode. Sobriety had become increasingly rare for Alistair these days. The unpredictability of his condition weighed heavily on Donovan, his eyes growing moist with unshed tears.

Turning to Evelyn, Donovan explained gently, "My grandfather's memory isn't what it used to be. He gets confused sometimes. But don't worry - perhaps if you visit more often, it might help trigger his memories."

Hearing that Alistair struggled with recollection and occasional disorientation, Evelyn felt a wave of relief wash over her, easing the tightness in her chest. Simultaneously, a daring idea took root in her mind. Remembering Liam's indifference and Seraphina's public humiliation, Evelyn vowed silently that one day, she would make them pay.

Clutching this new determination like a lifeline, Evelyn quickly regained her composure. She bowed her head, pretending to dab at non-existent tears. "I understand completely, Donovan. Don't worry - even if it's just a misunderstanding, I'm happy to help in any way. It would be wonderful if Alistair could recover his memories soon."

Then, turning to Alistair with practiced compassion softening her voice, Evelyn continued, "We have met before, Alistair. You once told me I reminded you of your granddaughter. I truly hope you get better soon."

Alistair's gaze drifted into the distance, his expression blank. "Granddaughter... Where is my granddaughter?" he murmured absently.

As Evelyn reached to take Alistair's hand, he unexpectedly pulled away and stood abruptly.

"Seraphina is throwing me a birthday celebration, isn't she? Please, take me there. I want to see everything. It's been too long since we had such a gathering," Alistair said to Donovan.

Donovan gently took his grandfather's arm, guiding him toward the grand hall. Evelyn, refusing to be deterred by the awkward moment, followed closely behind. She recognized the rarity of this opportunity - if played correctly, this could be her golden ticket up the social ladder.

While the Hartley family was certainly wealthy, their fortune paled in comparison to the Kensingtons'. For Evelyn, this wasn't just about money - it was about status, about reclaiming the dignity that had been stripped from her.

Her mind raced with possibilities. After settling Alistair at the banquet table, Donovan discreetly positioned two bodyguards nearby to keep watch. Evelyn seized the chance to sit beside Alistair, ignoring how he seemed to look right through her. She was determined to project an image of intimacy with Alistair, hoping to convince others of their fabricated connection.

Donovan observed Evelyn's maneuvering, his brow furrowing slightly. It was then the head butler interjected with a pointed question that hung heavy in the air: "Is Miss Hartley truly a member of the Kensington family?"
###Chapter 243

Donovan responded with hesitation, "I can't be certain about that. Only my grandfather would know the truth. If he believes Evelyn is related, I'll order a DNA test right away."

Establishing blood relations proved complicated since Donovan's cousin's parents had passed, eliminating the possibility of direct parental verification. This could potentially make the DNA results inconclusive.

Watching Evelyn's excessive flattery, the butler sighed in disappointment. "Even if she wasn't raised as a Kensington, no true descendant would behave so shamelessly. She clearly doesn't value the Hartleys who raised her."

His words held undeniable truth. Even Seraphina, known for her charm, never stooped to such obsequious behavior. This only deepened Donovan's distaste for Evelyn, who valued superficial charm over genuine character.

As Evelyn fawned over Liam, Seraphina watched with growing irritation, her jaw clenched tight. A whisper came from beside her: "Miss Kensington, you must find a way to remove Evelyn from this event. There's no proof of her claims yet. Just look at that smug expression - it's unbearable!"

Seraphina snapped, "Do you think I'm blind? I don't need reminders about the obvious."

Her voice dripped with contempt as she continued, "I've no interest in competing for grandfather's attention. I've prepared a masterpiece as his birthday gift. Even if Evelyn turns out to be family, I'll show her she can't compare."

Thinking of the exquisite artwork Olivia had spent weeks creating, Seraphina's confidence swelled, her chin lifting with pride.

The gift presentation arrived. Seraphina deliberately chose to go last, ensuring her offering would be the grand finale. She wanted this moment to leave an indelible impression on Liam.

When Seraphina unveiled her present, the room fell into awed silence. On an emerald velvet tray sat a breathtakingly carved phoenix, its wings outstretched mid-flight. The craftsmanship was so exquisite that individual feathers appeared to flutter, as if the mythical bird might take flight at any moment.

Such artistry was rare, perhaps beyond even master craftsmen. While Seraphina didn't claim to have made it herself, guests praised her thoughtfulness and dedication. Even Donovan couldn't hide his admiration. "Grandfather has always treasured such pieces. This will bring him immense joy."

With regal poise, Seraphina replied, "For our grandfather, only the best will do. His happiness makes every effort worthwhile."

Her statement came with a pointed glance at Evelyn, throwing down an unspoken gauntlet.

Evelyn had brought a gift for Alistair. But Seraphina's extraordinary present had raised the stakes, forcing Evelyn to reconsider how to make her own offering stand out. Her frustration was palpable.

She seethed that Liam had attended alone without securing her an invitation. Seraphina's obvious interest in him stoked Evelyn's insecurities.

Evelyn's gift - mere health supplements prepared by an assistant - paled in comparison to Seraphina's phoenix.

Donovan noticed Evelyn's discomfort and shook his head slightly at her poor manners. When Liam saw the carving, recognition flashed across his face, his hands trembling slightly. The style was unmistakably Olivia's. But how was this possible?
###Chapter 244

Liam's pulse quickened as he approached the artifact, compelled by an intense need to verify its provenance. Who could possibly have created such a magnificent piece? But just as Liam extended his hand, a sharp cracking sound reverberated through the grand hall.

At first, the assembled guests dismissed it as a trick of the acoustics. Their skepticism turned to stunned silence when the ornate tray holding the delicate crane fractured visibly before their eyes, shattering into countless fragments that skittered across the polished mahogany table.

Moments earlier, Seraphina had been glowing under the shower of compliments, her crimson lips curved in triumph. Now, as the carved masterpiece disintegrated, her expression transformed into a mask of horrified disbelief.

The unspoken question hung heavy in the air - what was this sculpture truly made of? The implications were devastating, not just for the gift's value, but for the Kensington family's carefully cultivated reputation among the elite.

Seizing the moment, Evelyn stepped forward with calculated grace, her voice laced with honeyed malice. "My dear Seraphina, while your gift was certainly eye-catching, its durability leaves much to be desired."

With deliberate slowness, Evelyn retrieved a glittering shard from the wreckage, holding it up to catch the light. Her smirk widened as she examined the fragment. "We all assumed this was genuine jade. How amusing to discover it's merely glass. Though I suppose with such intricate craftsmanship, no one thought to verify the materials?"

The titters of the crowd burned Seraphina's ears like acid. Her delicate features twisted in outrage as she marched forward, fists clenched. "This is impossible! Glass? That's absurd!"

Seraphina had invested a small fortune in this gift. How could Olivia have betrayed her like this?

Evelyn's mocking laughter rang out. "That look of shock tells me everything, darling. Clearly this wasn't your handiwork. Who did you commission? Do share, so the rest of us might avoid similar embarrassment."

Though the guests remained silent, their contemptuous stares spoke volumes. Seraphina's grand gesture had spectacularly backfired. The gift meant to cement her status now lay in ruins. Alistair remained ominously quiet, his thunderous expression more damning than any words.

Donovan's face darkened like a gathering storm as he shot his cousin a withering glare.

For the first time in her privileged life, Seraphina found herself the object of ridicule. Pride had always been her armor, and this public humiliation struck like a dagger to her carefully constructed image.

"You vile creature!" Seraphina's hand flew out before she could stop herself, connecting with Evelyn's cheek in a resounding slap.

Evelyn staggered back, her hand flying to her stinging face, eyes wide with shock.

Seraphina's voice dripped venom. "My grandfather merely remarked you bore a passing resemblance. Don't flatter yourself, you grasping little nobody! Look at you - so desperate to claim kinship you'd abandon your own family. Who do you think you're fooling?"

Evelyn recovered quickly, her retort sharp as a blade. "Coming from the woman shamelessly chasing an engaged man? Tell me, do your finishing schools teach homewrecking alongside etiquette? Or is husband-stealing an extracurricular activity?"

The confrontation escalated with terrifying speed.

Donovan watched the catfight unfold with mounting frustration. This was beneath Seraphina - she was behaving like a common fishwife, not the refined socialite she'd been raised to be. He couldn't help but wonder how different things might have been had she not been influenced by her unscrupulous parents.

What should have been a dignified celebration of Alistair's birthday had descended into farce. Donovan stormed forward, physically separating the two women. "Enough! Have you both taken leave of your senses?"
###Chapter 245

Seraphina Kensington dramatically rubbed her arm, her voice dripping with exaggerated pain. "See? She attacked me first! I was just defending myself. You have to be fair about this!"

Evelyn Hartley shot Seraphina a venomous glare, her eyes narrowing to dangerous slits. The audacity of this woman, batting her eyelashes at Donovan as if she already belonged to the Kensington family!

Donovan's voice rumbled like distant thunder. "That doesn't excuse your actions, Seraphina. You're confined to your room until further notice. Use this time to reflect on your behavior."

Tears shimmered in Seraphina's eyes as her voice cracked with emotion. "This is so unfair! She provoked me first. Who does she think she is, mocking me like that? Donovan, we're family! Are you really going to let this outsider humiliate me?"

Massaging his temples, Donovan felt the beginnings of a migraine. He knew his cousin too well - unless Evelyn suffered consequences for her taunts, Seraphina would escalate this situation beyond repair. While family embarrassment was one thing, if Alistair's fragile memory suffered another shock...

The problem remained - Donovan still couldn't confirm whether Evelyn was actually his long-lost relative. He was trapped in an impossible position.

At that moment, Liam Blackwood approached, positioning himself protectively in front of Evelyn. Seraphina's face flushed crimson with barely contained rage at the sight.

Evelyn, meanwhile, painted on her sweetest smile. "Liam, I knew you'd protect me from this bully."

Ignoring Evelyn completely, Liam fixed his icy gaze on Seraphina. "Miss Kensington, instead of harassing Evelyn, perhaps you should track down whoever sabotaged your gift. They're the real villain here - the one who owes explanations to both you and your grandfather."

Cornered, Seraphina snapped, "I made it myself, alright? I messed up. End of story." Even she recognized how flimsy this excuse sounded.

Donovan's displeasure was evident. "Seraphina, even if you commissioned someone, everyone knows your intentions were good. Now that your surprise is ruined, shouldn't you hold the responsible party accountable?"

"I told you, I made this gift!" Seraphina's voice rose sharply, edged with desperation.

Beneath her fury, a thread of rationality remained. Olivia Sinclair couldn't be exposed - not yet. If anyone recognized Olivia, everything would collapse. For now, Olivia had to stay hidden.

Seraphina's eyes darkened with cold vengeance. She'd make Olivia pay for this humiliation - but later. Much later. Her lips twisted in a silent snarl, rage coiling inside her like a serpent ready to strike.

Suddenly, Donovan had a startling realization. The person he'd been searching for might have crafted this very object. His thoughtful gaze shifted to Liam.

In a flash, Liam seized Seraphina's wrist. She gasped at the unexpected contact, meeting eyes as cold as winter steel.

"Who really made this?" Liam demanded, his voice laced with quiet menace.

A tremor of fear ran through Seraphina. There was no mistaking the threat in Liam's tone. "Mr. Blackwood," she stammered, "I already told you - I made it. Why won't you believe me?"
###Chapter 246

The air crackled with tension as Evelyn stepped forward. "Liam, please," she said softly, placing a gentle hand on his arm. "Don't cause a scene because of me. I'm certain Miss Kensington regrets her actions. I'm willing to forgive her."

Seraphina shot Evelyn a look so venomous it could have poisoned the champagne. She struggled against Liam's iron grip, her face flushed with indignation. "Mr. Blackwood, I'm feeling unwell. I need to rest. Release me this instant!"

Donovan cleared his throat awkwardly, his voice strained. "Mr. Blackwood, this is a family matter. It doesn't concern you."

Liam froze, his eyes darkening with suspicion. Slowly, he released Seraphina's wrist. His piercing gaze swept over Donovan and Seraphina, a cold realization dawning in his gut.

A terrifying thought struck Liam like lightning. Olivia might be hidden among the Kensingtons. But how could she possibly have ended up with that family?

The question hung heavy in the air, a seed of doubt Liam immediately wished he hadn't planted. Did Donovan know anything about this?

Panic clawed at Liam's chest. He shouldn't have involved Donovan in this mess. But back then, with no other options, he'd seen no alternative.

Frustrated, Liam asked Evelyn, who was still quietly weeping, to leave first.

As Sebastian escorted Evelyn away through the murmuring crowd, Liam turned to depart. But then - movement. A blur of color caught his eye. A woman was pushing desperately through the sea of guests, her face etched with determination.

The woman rushed toward Donovan, dropping to her knees right before him. The sudden action silenced the crowd instantly, all eyes locking onto the kneeling figure.

Liam spun around, his breath catching in his throat as recognition hit him like a freight train.

Seraphina's mouth fell open when she saw Olivia collapse to her knees before Donovan. Donovan recovered first, quickly instructing his men to take Alistair away while he handled this unexpected situation.

Unable to speak, Olivia reached into her pocket and produced a carefully folded note. In shaky handwriting, she described being a victim of human trafficking, brought to the Kensington family against her will. She pleaded for freedom, explaining how she and her unborn child were being held captive in terrible conditions. The words painted a picture of desperation that made several guests gasp.

Olivia was risking everything. If fortune smiled upon her and there was even one compassionate soul among the Kensingtons, she might escape this nightmare. Even if her gamble failed, she reasoned they wouldn't dare harm her with so many witnesses. Seraphina's grand celebration had unwittingly provided the perfect stage for her plea.

Moreover, Olivia clung to the slim hope that some guests might be connected to the Bennetts or Whitmores - families who might intervene on her behalf.

Originally, Olivia hadn't planned to burst into the party. She'd deliberately given Seraphina an inferior gift, expecting to be banished from the private rooms. But she'd underestimated Seraphina's cunning. The woman might act like a spoiled brat, but she was sharper than she appeared.

Thankfully, Olivia had spent days playing the perfect victim, lulling Seraphina's guards into complacency. Their lowered vigilance had given her this single chance.

Olivia's silent plea contained horrifying revelations. A pregnant woman, unable to speak, trafficked into a powerful family and held captive. The crowd began buzzing with shocked whispers.

"My God! The scandals these wealthy families hide! How can they be so cruel?"

"Doesn't Eldermere have laws? How is this possible in this day and age?"

The murmurs grew louder, spreading through the glittering crowd like wildfire. Donovan's face darkened as he scanned the note, his expression unreadable. Liam stood frozen, torn between rushing to Olivia's side and maintaining his cover.

Seraphina's cheeks burned crimson with fury. "This is absurd!" she spat. "Someone remove this madwoman at once!"

But no one moved. The weight of Olivia's accusation hung heavy in the opulent ballroom, turning the celebration into something far more sinister. The Kensingtons' perfect facade had cracked, and everyone could see the ugliness beneath.
###Chapter 247

The whispers spread like wildfire through the crowd. "Haven't you heard? The Kensingtons from Westhaven are practically royalty there. Their fortune protects them from consequences, so this doesn't surprise me at all."

Seraphina's face turned ashen, her entire body shaking with barely contained fury. Her sharp gaze swept across the gathering, but her usual entourage was conspicuously absent.

Donovan's expression darkened. He'd known Seraphina had detained a woman, but never imagined she'd stoop to such cruelty. While his cousin often escaped accountability, this time she'd gone too far. Had she completely lost her mind?

Before Donovan could intervene, Seraphina rushed toward the kneeling Olivia with saccharine sweetness. "Olivia, darling, what's come over you? Get up now. I've provided you with gourmet meals and proper care. If you wished to leave, you only needed to ask. This theatrical display is unnecessary."

Raising her voice for dramatic effect, Seraphina continued, "What a terrible misunderstanding! This poor soul was homeless and pregnant when I found her. Out of kindness, I took her in. But clearly she suffers from mental instability. Don't believe me? Call the authorities to investigate! In fact, I've treated her like royalty - personal nutritionists, daily massages. Why would I go to such lengths if my intentions weren't pure?"

Olivia's mouth fell open, her complexion draining to ghostly white. Her carefully planned exposure had spectacularly backfired.

The crowd's sympathy shifted instantly.

"Just a misunderstanding after all!"

"I knew Lady Kensington would never do such things! How cruel to manipulate such generosity!"

Natalie strained on tiptoes behind the throng, desperate to see the commotion. When she couldn't push through, she grabbed a bystander's sleeve. "What's happening? What are they saying?"

The man sneered in disgust. "Nothing important. Lady Kensington took in some mute pregnant woman who's now biting the hand that feeds her. Can you imagine? Accusing her benefactor! And the poor thing's expecting!"

Natalie's eyes widened in shock. Mute and pregnant - it had to be Olivia. Without hesitation, she began shoving through the crowd. "Olivia! Olivia!"

Olivia heard Natalie's voice and tried to locate her friend. But Seraphina swiftly seized Olivia's arm, digging her nails deep into the flesh.

Unable to voice her pain, Olivia could only endure silently. She looked pleadingly at Donovan, but he stood frozen in thought, brow furrowed. Olivia's heart plummeted - she felt utterly abandoned.

Then, through the sea of faces, Olivia spotted someone familiar. Liam! He'd been watching her intently from the crowd's edge. When their eyes met, she saw both joy and anguish in his gaze.

Olivia tried moving toward Liam, but he remained rooted in place, jaw clenched as he deliberately looked away. Liam reminded himself to maintain control. Now that he'd found Olivia, there were diplomatic ways to secure her release. But timing was everything - if he acted impulsively now, months of careful planning would be ruined. The final pieces were nearly in place. He couldn't risk everything for one emotional moment, no matter how much he longed to sweep her away.

Seraphina raised her hand as if to comfort Olivia, her face the picture of wounded benevolence. "How could you betray me like this? Have you no conscience? If you truly wish to leave, by all means go. But I wonder how you'll survive without the Kensingtons' protection."
###Chapter 248

Seraphina released Olivia and moved to Alistair's side. Olivia attempted to leave, but an imposing figure blocked her path. The realization struck her - this was a Kensington family gathering, and departure required their explicit consent.

"Donovan," Seraphina whispered urgently, pressing close to her cousin. "I'll confess everything, but we must take her away immediately."

Alistair's voice turned glacial. "Have you lost your mind? Do you comprehend who stands before us?"

Seraphina interrupted with desperation lacing her words. "Her identity means nothing now! Even if she's royalty, we must act. If her protectors discover my actions, they'll crucify me. The Kensington name will be tarnished forever. Grandfather's health is already failing - this scandal could be fatal!"

Donovan's expression hardened like tempered steel. "I won't be complicit in your schemes, Seraphina. The woman remains here, under my protection."

A venomous smile curled Seraphina's lips as malice danced in her eyes. "As you wish, cousin. I'll bear the consequences of my mistakes alone."

In truth, Seraphina had already set her plan in motion. The moment Olivia was escorted from the ballroom, the hired mercenaries waiting outside would ensure the problem disappeared permanently. Olivia's death was necessary to preserve Seraphina's reputation.

Once silenced forever, Seraphina intended to flee to Westhaven. By the time Donovan uncovered the truth, it would be far too late for reparations.

Just as Seraphina basked in her imagined triumph, the impossible occurred. With a violent shove, Sebastian sent her sprawling across the marble floor as he emerged from behind the decorative screen.

Donovan's pulse accelerated at Sebastian's sudden appearance. He discreetly motioned for nearby guards to intercept the elderly man, fearing another episode.

Defying expectations, Sebastian bulldozed through all obstacles with terrifying intensity. "Out of my way!" he roared, his voice carrying the authority of the former Kensington patriarch.

The atmosphere crackled with tension. Nearby guests visibly trembled, perspiration beading on their foreheads under Sebastian's commanding presence.

Olivia's despair deepened, though a spark of defiance remained. Was escape truly impossible? Yet surrender wasn't in her nature.

Sebastian loomed over Olivia, his shadow enveloping her. When their eyes met, recognition flashed across Olivia's face. This distinguished gentleman - wasn't he the confused elderly man from Isabelle's birthday celebration? Her breath caught in surprise.

Today, Sebastian carried himself with regal dignity, his hearing noticeably improved. From the hushed whispers around them, Olivia pieced together his identity - the former Kensington family head, Sebastian Kensington.

As their gazes locked, Sebastian suddenly dropped to his knees and embraced Olivia with shocking strength. Tears streamed down his weathered cheeks as he repeated a name that meant nothing to most present. "Vivienne! Vivienne! You've come back to me!"

Baffled murmurs rippled through the crowd, though Donovan and Seraphina recognized the significance immediately. Vivienne Kensington - their long-lost aunt who had severed ties with the family decades ago, taking her child with her.

Seraphina's teeth sank into her lower lip. Could her grandfather truly believe Olivia was his missing granddaughter?

This dangerous delusion couldn't be allowed to continue. "Donovan," Seraphina hissed, "Grandfather's having another episode. Have him removed immediately while I deal with Olivia. We can't become the laughingstock of high society."
###Chapter 249

The initial shock faded, and Donovan Kensington responded with unexpected composure. "In the Kensington family, only our grandfather and the older generation remember what our aunt looked like. I barely caught a glimpse of her as a child, and you've never seen her at all. There aren't even photos of her or her child in the house. Our grandfather may be unwell, his mind not what it used to be, but his memories of our aunt and cousin have always stayed sharp."

Seraphina Kensington’s unease deepened at his words. Her voice rose involuntarily as she demanded clarification. "What are you saying? Are you implying Olivia is our aunt’s child?"

Her emotions made her forget to lower her voice, and nearby guests overheard. At first, they had been puzzled by Alistair Kensington’s strange behavior, but now the pieces were falling into place.

"Olivia never seemed to have any family connections. She had no relatives in Crestwood, which is probably why the Blackwood family took her in. Her parents and paternal grandparents are gone, but I’ve never heard anything about her maternal grandparents. Honestly, she bears a resemblance to the Kensington children. Don’t you think?" Sebastian Montgomery remarked pointedly, catching Liam Blackwood’s subtle cue.

Liam’s intention was clear. Whether Olivia truly belonged to the Kensington lineage or not, they needed to fuel the rumors to make it believable. Besides, it was Alistair who had recognized her first. If she turned out not to be his granddaughter, the blame wouldn’t fall on her.

More importantly, the Kensingtons held a status far above the Whitmores and Blackwoods. With Alistair’s backing, no one would dare mistreat Olivia again.

Wrapped in Alistair’s embrace, Olivia felt an odd sense of familiarity. She could tell he was utterly convinced she was his granddaughter. Maybe it would be easier to just accept it.

But Olivia couldn’t bring herself to take someone else’s place. Gently, she patted Alistair’s back in comfort before pulling away and signing to him. Her gestures conveyed, "Sir, we’ve met before, and perhaps it’s fate. You think I look familiar, but you might be mistaken."

Olivia had grown up with her parents. Stories about her maternal grandfather’s family were absent from her childhood. All she knew was that they had disapproved of her mother’s marriage to her father, leading to unforgivable actions. Because of that, her parents left with her and never looked back.

Later, when her parents passed away, none of the remaining relatives urged her to reconnect with her maternal grandparents. They remained silent about the past, yet Olivia sensed her family’s inherent kindness. Had her grandparents’ actions not been so severe, her parents would never have cut ties completely.

With resolve hardening in her gaze, Olivia shook her head decisively. Her gestures made it clear—she only wanted to leave, even if it meant letting Seraphina’s misdeeds go unpunished. She trusted Alistair to be reasonable and hoped he would respect her wish.

Tears still blurred Alistair’s vision as he stared at her, undeterred.

"You are Vivienne’s daughter. I’m certain of it. You look just like she did at your age. How could I, your grandfather, be wrong? After all these years, Vivienne still refuses to come home. She must despise me and the Kensington name."

His voice trembled. "Child, my memory may fail me these days, but seeing you brings back a sense of familiarity I can’t ignore. I don’t even need a DNA test to know you’re a Kensington. Please, stay. I want to make amends. I lost Vivienne. I can’t bear the thought of losing you too."

His words hung heavy in the air, leaving Olivia torn between the past she knew and the family she never expected to find.
###Chapter 250

Alistair's aged tears moved Olivia, yet she remained resolute, remembering how her own mother had wept whenever her grandfather was mentioned.

Whether Alistair was her biological grandfather or not, Olivia had no interest in the Kensington family fortune.

Olivia placed a protective hand over her abdomen, gathering her strength to rise. Using sign language, she expressed her gratitude to Alistair. She thanked him for his kindness in allowing her to leave and promised not to hold Seraphina accountable for the younger woman's misdeeds these past weeks.

Seraphina and Olivia continued their silent exchange, each gesture laden with unspoken emotions.

Seraphina was clearly the most agitated among them. She no longer expected Donovan to intervene, telling herself they hadn't even done the paternity test yet - perhaps Alistair was merely confused temporarily. She felt an urgent need to remove Olivia immediately, or the consequences would never end.

With these thoughts racing through her mind, Seraphina swiftly intercepted Olivia as she tried to leave.

"Where do you think you're going? You destroyed my gift, framed me, and now you're deceiving my grandfather! You think you can just walk away? Not a chance!" Seraphina shrieked.

Olivia's icy gaze locked onto Seraphina's, noticing the murderous glint in the other woman's eyes.

A bitter chuckle escaped Olivia's lips. She had been willing to let Seraphina off, but the woman's relentless hostility changed her mind.

Meanwhile, Natalie finally pushed through the crowd to reach the front. Seeing Olivia, she couldn't contain her tears.

It marked the first time Natalie had ever lost her composure in public.

Natalie's concern for Olivia ran deep and constant. No matter what she was doing, thoughts of Olivia dominated her mind, eclipsing everything else.

Knowing Olivia's condition - unable to speak and carrying a child - Natalie believed her friend must be enduring unimaginable hardships. Her contempt for the Whitmore and Blackwood families grew as she considered their empty promises. They had vowed to protect Olivia, yet their inaction proved them unreliable.

Natalie's frustration even extended to her own brother, Daniel, who had failed to provide the support Olivia desperately needed.

Overcome with emotion, Natalie approached Olivia, tears streaming down her face. "Olivia, you've lost so much weight. What's happened to you? It's Seraphina, isn't it? How dare she keep you confined? I'm calling the police right now!"

Caught off guard, Seraphina's eyes widened in shock before she quickly countered, "What nonsense are you spouting? I've already explained - Olivia has been well cared for in my home. How can you call that confinement?"

As this exchange unfolded, Olivia struggled to free her hand from Seraphina's iron grip but failed. With her free hand, Olivia gently wiped away Natalie's tears, offering silent comfort.

Unable to use sign language with one hand restrained, Olivia turned her head and fixed Seraphina with an intense, chilling stare.

The ferocity in Olivia's eyes was a stark departure from her usual quiet demeanor, startling Seraphina. Guilt began creeping into Seraphina's conscience as she remembered Olivia was the pitiful victim of human trafficking.
###Chapter 251

Seraphina's fingers dug into Olivia's arm with bruising force. "You're not leaving until I get answers," she hissed, her voice dripping with venom.

Natalie straightened her spine, her piercing gaze locking onto Seraphina. "Miss Kensington, while the full story remains unclear, one fact is undeniable - Olivia was held against her will. You claim to pity her, yet everyone in Crestwood knows she's Liam's wife and a dear friend of my family. William Hayes himself has publicly sworn to protect her. With such powerful connections, how can you possibly call her pitiful? If she's pitiful, what does that make the rest of us?"

The air crackled with tension as Natalie continued, "Olivia was kidnapped by criminals while visiting Henry Winslow's grave. While I don't suspect the Kensingtons' involvement, if you truly rescued her, why wasn't she taken to authorities or a hospital? Why label her a vagrant instead?" Her voice turned razor-sharp. "What are you hiding? Do you think because Olivia can't speak for herself, you can manipulate the situation?"

Seraphina stood frozen, her lips parted in shock. The irony burned like acid in her throat. Olivia, this seemingly fragile woman who Evelyn had bullied so easily, was actually Liam Blackwood's wife.

A bitter jealousy twisted Seraphina's features. Evelyn had schemed for years to marry Liam and failed, yet this "pitiful" woman had succeeded. Though she finally released Olivia, the murderous glint in Seraphina's eyes promised future retribution when the time was right.

Olivia caught that fleeting but unmistakable look of malice. A cold dread settled in her chest. Would leaving with Natalie bring trouble to the Bennetts?

At this critical moment, Donovan stepped forward with practiced charm. "My deepest apologies," he said smoothly, offering Olivia a conciliatory smile. "My cousin can be... impulsive. But I assure you, she'll learn from this."

His tone turned earnest. "You heard Grandfather call you his granddaughter - a claim I find quite plausible. Given his fragile health, I must insist you stay until he stabilizes. Then we can discuss everything properly." He placed a hand over his heart. "Your safety here is my personal guarantee. Everyone present will bear witness. Should anything happen to you, I accept full responsibility."

Natalie scoffed. "Words are wind without action."

Without hesitation, Donovan summoned his legal team. "We'll draft a binding agreement," he announced. "And since Mr. Blackwood is Olivia's husband, his signature will formalize the terms."

When Liam reviewed the document, his brows shot up. "She must report to you about everyone she meets? You're restricting her basic freedom of association?"

Adjusting his glasses, Donovan countered with a sharp smile. "Mr. Blackwood, this is for your wife's protection. Unlike some, we Kensingtons take family security seriously. Had others been more vigilant, she might never have been abducted."

The unspoken accusation hung heavy in the air as lawyers scurried to finalize the agreement that would chain Olivia to the Kensington estate under the guise of protection.
###Chapter 252

Liam's fingers trembled around the pen, the weight of his actions pressing down on him like an iron cloak. The unspoken accusation cut deeper than any blade - that to most, including perhaps Olivia, he'd become nothing more than an absent, indifferent husband.

Standing beside another woman, his moral compass had shattered beyond repair. He no longer felt deserving of Olivia's presence, nor did he possess the courage to meet her gaze after everything that had transpired.

When their eyes finally locked for the first time in what felt like lifetimes, Liam's gaze burned with a turbulent storm of remorse, yearning, and utter bewilderment. That fleeting moment crackled with unspoken electricity before he schooled his features into practiced indifference.

Olivia caught the briefest glimpse of his inner torment before he masked it. She turned away sharply, teeth sinking into her lower lip hard enough to draw blood, questioning whether she'd imagined the raw emotion in his eyes.

Now she understood with painful clarity how others had manipulated the space between them. There had been moments she'd considered explaining, laying bare her truth. But realization struck like lightning - as the wronged party, the burden of justification shouldn't rest on her shoulders.

Liam's opinions, once her guiding stars, now meant less than dust. As this truth settled in her bones, Olivia felt the last fragile threads of their connection unraveling.

His expression glacial, Liam signed the documents with quick, sharp strokes before passing them to Donovan. As he did, his voice dropped to a dangerous murmur. "I want to know exactly how Olivia ended up in your care."

Donovan accepted the papers with a frown that spoke volumes. "My cousin overstepped, but rest assured she'll face consequences. I located your wife days ago, but dealing with Seraphina requires... delicacy. She's both reckless and paranoid." A ghost of admiration flickered across his face. "Truthfully, it was Olivia's own brilliance that secured her freedom."

Liam nodded, eyes suspiciously bright before he mastered himself. That word - brilliance - echoed like a condemnation. His negligence had forced her to become resourceful.

Emotions churning, Liam spoke again, voice thick with unvoiced regrets. "Regardless... you have my gratitude."

Initially, Donovan had pitied the man before him, recognizing the impossible tangle of his circumstances. But as he considered the broader web involving Liam, Evelyn, and Seraphina, his sympathy evaporated.

"Mr. Blackwood," Donovan said with quiet intensity, "while I've no right to comment on personal matters, hear this - hesitation causes more damage than decisive action. Once you choose, commit without looking back." His gaze sharpened. "No one waits forever."

Liam's fists clenched, frustration and resignation warring across his features. Finally, a weary sigh escaped him, carrying the weight of his impossible position.

"Noted," Liam replied, tone edged with finality. "I'll... consider your words carefully. If nothing changes within five days, I'll release Olivia completely." His next words landed like stones. "But you should know - there's strong evidence Olivia might actually be your cousin."

Memories surfaced of crucial information Henry had shared years prior - that the stature and influence of Olivia's maternal grandfather's family dwarfed even the mighty Blackwood dynasty.
###Chapter 253

Olivia's mother had always been stubborn to a fault. She'd severed ties with her parents over some long-buried family secret, refusing all attempts at reconciliation. This decades-old rift explained why no one from her mother's side had ever come looking for Olivia - which was precisely why Henry had begged Liam to keep this truth hidden.

Liam concluded it was better to wait and see if Olivia's maternal relatives would make the first move. Their complete silence over the years suggested they had no intention of welcoming her back.

What Liam didn't anticipate was that Alistair Kensington's family had actually been searching tirelessly for Olivia. Geographical barriers and limited local connections had thwarted their efforts until now.

Liam's decision to let Olivia stay with the Kensingtons had been temporary. Though they appeared welcoming, he suspected darker motives might be at play.

Donovan wasn't surprised by Liam's words. That first encounter with Olivia had sparked an inexplicable sense of recognition that lingered long after their meeting.

When their eyes met, Donovan was instantly transported back to childhood memories of his aunt, though they'd spent little time together. Alistair's visible excitement upon seeing Olivia only confirmed Donovan's growing certainty about their blood relation.

"Thank you, Liam," Donovan said with genuine appreciation before subtly creating distance between them.

Meanwhile, Seraphina's rage was a living thing, twisting her delicate features into something ugly. But she was powerless to act.

Donovan now held the family reins firmly in his grasp. Seraphina knew one wrong move could give him the excuse he needed to cast her out - a threat that haunted her every waking moment.

Just days ago, Seraphina might have seized the chance to leave with Olivia. But recent humiliations had changed everything. Publicly exposed and embarrassed by Olivia before the entire family, Seraphina found herself temporarily paralyzed - yet still clinging to desperate hope that some escape remained.

Alistair grew increasingly convinced Olivia was his long-lost granddaughter, appearing ready to follow her anywhere. Donovan's protective interest in Olivia only further complicated the family's intricate power dynamics.

Under the weight of numerous envious stares, Olivia felt utterly helpless. While she didn't fully agree with Donovan and Liam's decisions, she understood their strategic necessity. Now marked as Seraphina's enemy, Olivia recognized this difficult path as her only viable option.

As the party wound down and guests departed, the Kensingtons prepared to return to their separate lives. Olivia was leaving - this morning she'd hidden in a kitchen supply van just to get here. Desperate to avoid further attention, Seraphina reluctantly allowed Olivia to share her car.

The journey had been grueling for Olivia. Now she finally had a moment of comfort in the Kensington family car. Donovan assisted Olivia with unexpected gentleness that didn't escape Seraphina's notice, fueling her simmering jealousy.

Celeste Dumont, sensing Seraphina's dark mood, cautiously approached to open the car door. Instead of entering, Seraphina fixed her assistant with an icy, penetrating glare that promised consequences.
###Chapter 254

A shiver ran down Celeste's spine as she met Seraphina's glacial stare, silently cursing the incompetence of her team that had led to this disaster. How hard could it be to watch one mute pregnant woman? Those worthless idiots!

Before Celeste could react, Seraphina's palm connected sharply with her cheek. "Do you have something to confess?" Seraphina hissed, her voice dripping with venomous ice.

Panic seized Celeste as she dropped to her knees, words stumbling from her trembling lips. "Miss Kensington, I take full responsibility for today's failures, but I truly didn't anticipate this outcome. I'll accept any punishment. Though considering your health, it's imperative I continue searching for your heart transplant donor."

Rage and frustration made Seraphina's breath come in short gasps. Seeing her distress, Celeste swiftly produced the medication. After swallowing the pills, Seraphina's fury gradually subsided into cold calculation.

Celeste seized the moment to appeal to reason. "Please, Miss Kensington, calm yourself. Someone as insignificant as me isn't worth disturbing your peace. You can deal with my failures later. Once I've secured a replacement, punish me however you see fit. I'll accept it without complaint."

Seraphina's icy gaze softened marginally, though she remained silent for a long moment. "I'll spare you this time," she finally said, her deceptively soft tone laced with steel. "As for those incompetents, I never want to see them again. Make them disappear by any means necessary."

That musical voice, usually so refined, now carried chilling finality. The brutality of the order would have frozen anyone's blood. Celeste felt no pity for her doomed subordinates - survival in Seraphina's service demanded ruthlessness and cunning.

Just as Celeste began to rise in relief, Seraphina's cold voice stopped her. "In such a hurry? Your failures have ruined my mood. As punishment, you'll crawl back to the house. Understood?"

Celeste paled at the cruel command. "But Miss Kensington, it's nearly half a mile to the estate." Walking that distance would be arduous enough - crawling could cause permanent damage.

Seraphina remained unmoved. "Count yourself lucky this is your only punishment. Would you prefer joining your useless team on their final journey?"

The unspoken threat left no room for argument. Resigned, Celeste began her humiliating journey under the confused stares of passersby. Though Seraphina had booked the entire hotel for her event, staff and delivery personnel still moved about freely.

Onlookers whispered and pointed at the crawling woman, their expressions ranging from concern to morbid curiosity. With each painful movement, Seraphina's mood visibly improved, her lips curling in satisfaction.

Meanwhile, Olivia stepped into the Kensington estate with mixed emotions. Donovan's demeanor toward her had been surprisingly gentle throughout their return journey, offering multiple apologies that shocked her given his position as head of the Kensington family.
###Chapter 255

Olivia remained guarded despite Donovan's kindness, her trust not easily given in her fragile condition. As he escorted her inside, Donovan made certain Olivia was comfortably settled in her quarters, assigning both a personal chef and attendants to see to her needs.

His eyes kept drifting to Olivia's swollen belly during their conversation, his unspoken thoughts hanging heavy between them. Sharp as ever, Olivia could practically hear the pity in his gaze. She knew what people whispered - how her husband had abandoned her while she carried his child, leaving her future uncertain.

Noticing his discomfort, Donovan finally looked away, his posture turning awkward.

Olivia wasn't offended. With calm fingers, she typed out a message on her phone. "Don't worry. I'm accustomed to those looks by now. You're hardly the first."

Her words only deepened Donovan's guilt. His voice softened. "Please consider this your home. Ask for anything you need. And... perhaps visit Alistair occasionally? You're his granddaughter, and he's quite fond of you."

Olivia studied the hopeful glimmer in his eyes before responding carefully. "I doubt I'm who you're searching for, but I appreciate today's kindness. I'll visit Alistair when possible. May you find your cousin soon."

Donovan shook his head gently. "You already know the truth between us. I understand if you can't forgive our family's failures. But Alistair isn't getting younger, and your presence would mean everything. He bears no blame for past wrongs."

His words struck a chord. Though part of her recognized their connection, admitting it aloud felt impossible. Her mother's dying wishes echoed in her mind - the reluctance to return to the Kensington estate that Olivia now shared.

She knew her presence here unsettled certain family members. Yet circumstances left her no choice but to temporarily reside in the grand Kensington manor.

After ensuring Olivia's comfort with meticulous arrangements, Donovan turned to leave, issuing instructions to the butler.

First, he ordered Seraphina's immediate return to Westhaven, eliminating any chance she might harm Olivia again. Then he doubled Olivia's security detail, determined to protect her.

A sudden scream shattered the manor's tranquility, interrupting Donovan's plans for Olivia's peaceful stay.

Frowning, Donovan rushed toward the commotion. Servants had frozen in place, staring at the gates where Celeste, Seraphina's assistant, stood with bloodied knees, barely able to stand.

The whispering servants fell silent at Donovan's approach. Taking in Celeste's gruesome state, his frown deepened. "Have you lost your mind?" he demanded.

Despite her pain, Celeste managed to speak through clenched teeth. "Mr. Kensington, this is all my fault! Please don't blame Miss Kensington. She's ill and needs a transplant desperately."

"The scheme to find a donor through... unsavory means was my idea alone. Miss Kensington merely took pity on Olivia. She never approved my actions. I only wanted to help her!"

Donovan's expression turned glacial. "Do you comprehend the full consequences of taking responsibility for Seraphina? Shall I remind you?" he snapped.

Celeste trembled slightly. She knew exactly what awaited her as the scapegoat - Seraphina had made certain of that through this public humiliation.

Before Donovan could continue, Seraphina interrupted with feigned urgency, stomping her foot for attention. "Donovan! Even if Celeste acted wrongly, it was for my sake. None of you care about my condition as she does!"

Donovan's sharp gaze caught the fleeting smugness in Seraphina's eyes. "Celeste committed a grave offense. As head of this family, I must address it properly," he stated coldly.

Unable to counter his logic, Seraphina dramatically knelt beside Celeste. "You can't punish her! She's been with me since childhood. If you punish her, punish me too!"

The absurdity made Donovan laugh despite the tension.

His resolve remained firm. "I never intended to let you escape consequences. You're confined to your rooms until your departure for Westhaven."

A subtle shift crossed Seraphina's face before she clutched her chest dramatically, feigning collapse.

Ever loyal, Celeste sprang to support the act. "Mr. Kensington, reconsider! Miss Kensington is innocent! With her heart condition, anything could happen during travel. You'd regret it forever!" she pleaded.
###Chapter 256

Donovan Kensington clenched his jaw, his voice dripping with cold determination. "If I recall correctly, she's been begging to return to Westhaven for months. I'm simply granting her wish. Shouldn't she be grateful? Besides, the best medical specialists who treated her before are based there. This is for her own good."

As Donovan laid out his reasoning, Seraphina's performance escalated dramatically. She let out a piercing wail, clutching her chest as if on the verge of collapse, hoping to manipulate Donovan's decision through sheer theatrics. Celeste Dumont, despite her own discomfort, had no choice but to continue supporting Seraphina's exaggerated distress.

Donovan's icy gaze swept over both women before he exhaled wearily. His tone softened marginally as he commanded, "Return to your quarters. I'll inform you of my final decision when I'm ready."

The moment Donovan turned away, Seraphina immediately dropped her act. She shot Celeste a venomous glare, her frustration palpable. "This is all your fault. You're why Donovan isn't buying it."

Celeste bowed her head in submission, her voice trembling with apology. "My deepest apologies, Miss Kensington. I accept full responsibility for my shortcomings."

"Stay kneeling here until I say otherwise," Seraphina snapped before her thoughts turned to Olivia Sinclair, her long-lost cousin who had recently returned to Newport.

The security team immediately alerted Donovan when Seraphina arrived to visit Olivia. After brief consideration, Donovan granted permission but issued strict orders. "Double the guards around Olivia. Protect her at all costs. Report any incidents to me immediately."

"Yes, sir."

Olivia was enjoying a peaceful stroll through the gardens accompanied by her private nurse when she suddenly heard an artificially sweet voice behind her.

"There you are, darling Olivia!" Seraphina called out with exaggerated cheerfulness, her smile never reaching her cold eyes.

Olivia's entire body tensed. Just hearing that voice made her skin crawl. She turned slowly, her expression carefully blank.

Undeterred, Seraphina swept forward and linked arms with Olivia as if they were childhood friends. "Welcome home, cousin! I'm absolutely thrilled you're back. I brought you a present! I do hope you'll adore it."

Olivia's eyes flashed with warning as she forcefully disengaged herself, putting clear distance between them. It astonished her how Seraphina could pretend their bitter history didn't exist, acting as if yesterday's hostilities had never occurred.

Using sign language that was immediately interpreted, Olivia responded sharply. "Seraphina, spare me the act. We both know we're not friends. Consider this your only warning - if you cross me, I will hold you accountable. Since you haven't actually harmed me yet, I'm willing to overlook your past behavior. But stay away from me."

Seraphina merely batted her eyelashes, feigning innocence and hurt. "Are you really rejecting family, Olivia? I've apologized for the past. Can't you give me a chance to make things right? We should at least try to get along for Donovan's sake," she pleaded, her saccharine tone making Olivia's stomach turn.

Olivia's disgust grew as she witnessed Seraphina's transparent performance. With a discreet gesture, she signaled both her nurse and security detail to intervene and create space between them.
###Chapter 257

The bodyguards and nurse hesitated before finally stepping back, creating an uneasy space between the two women. Their retreat was reluctant, their protective instincts warring with their orders.

They didn't go far. From a careful distance, the security team kept vigilant eyes on Olivia and Seraphina. Their primary concern was ensuring the pregnant woman remained unharmed.

The moment they were alone, Seraphina's mask slipped. Her saccharine smile twisted into something venomous. The transformation was startling.

Glancing around with theatrical exaggeration, Seraphina sneered. "Ever since you showed up, Donovan barely glances my way. Imagine his reaction when he discovers you're not actually his cousin?"

Olivia arched one delicate eyebrow. Her fingers danced across her phone screen with practiced ease. "Is that supposed to be a threat?"

A cruel smirk played on Seraphina's lips. "Don't play dumb. You manipulated both Donovan and Alistair into believing you're their long-lost relative just to escape my control, didn't you?" She leaned closer, her voice dropping to a venomous whisper. "Alistair's memory isn't what it used to be - he's mistaken others for his granddaughter before. And Donovan? His blind respect for the old man made him an easy mark. You saw your opportunity and took it. That birthday gift scheme was particularly clever."

Olivia nearly choked on the absurdity of these baseless accusations. The irony was almost laughable.

A realization struck Olivia then - Seraphina hadn't been present during Donovan's private conversation with her. She didn't know Donovan had asked Olivia to stay regardless of blood relations, purely to humor Alistair's fragile belief.

This ignorance led Seraphina to construct an elaborate conspiracy theory where Olivia was the master manipulator.

In a twisted way, part of Seraphina's accusation held truth. Olivia had indeed researched Alistair's preferences before crafting his birthday present. But the motives behind this action were worlds apart from Seraphina's paranoid assumptions.

Interpreting Olivia's silence as confirmation, Seraphina's eyes glittered with malicious triumph. She seized Olivia's wrist with surprising strength. "If I were you, I wouldn't have the audacity to stay. The sheer shamelessness..." Her grip tightened. "Have your baby and disappear. Or I'll make you regret ever setting foot in Kensington Manor."

Olivia wrenched her arm free with a sharp motion. Her glacial stare could have frozen lava as she typed her response: "No need for concern. I'll be gone soon enough."

Staying permanently had never been part of Olivia's plans, regardless of her connection to the Kensingtons.

Seraphina's posture straightened with smug satisfaction, misinterpreting Olivia's words as surrender. With a contemptuous sniff, she strode away, the very picture of victorious arrogance.

Their heated exchange remained private, unnoticed by the watchful bodyguards stationed just out of earshot.

When Donovan received the report from his subordinate, his brow furrowed in concern.

###Chapter 258

"That's just like Seraphina," Donovan remarked with a sigh. "She hasn't harmed Olivia yet, so let's not provoke her. If she realizes we're monitoring her, she might act recklessly. At any rate, she'll be leaving soon. Everything's been arranged. For now, focus on keeping Olivia safe."

No sooner had Donovan spoken than the butler entered, looking slightly flustered. "Mr. Kensington, Mrs. Blackwood has a visitor."

"Is it one of Olivia's friends? Did he identify himself?" Donovan inquired, his curiosity piqued.

The butler nodded. "He introduced himself as Liam Blackwood."

Donovan's eyebrows shot up in surprise. "What could he possibly want?" he muttered. "Does he question my arrangements, or is he planning to reveal something to Olivia?"

Donovan assumed Liam was the scoundrel who'd abandoned his pregnant wife for another woman.

While Donovan respected Liam's sharp business acumen and impressive achievements, he strongly disapproved of the man's personal choices.

His first instinct was to send Liam away immediately. Yet after a moment's consideration, he reconsidered.

"Ask Olivia if she wishes to see him. If she agrees, arrange a suitable meeting place."

"Right away, sir," the butler responded with a polite bow.

Olivia was taken aback when informed of Liam's unexpected visit. She'd assumed he would simply mail the divorce papers, never expecting him to appear in person. Was he here to witness her signing them himself? That must be it - he probably wanted to finalize their separation quickly so he could marry Evelyn without delay.

Olivia gave a firm nod. She too wanted closure on their unhappy marriage.

Five minutes later, Liam was escorted to her sitting room. He looked as striking as ever, his composed demeanor giving nothing away, his dark eyes as unreadable as always.

As Liam entered, Olivia rose gracefully and acknowledged him with a slight nod.

After their confrontation yesterday, she found herself surprisingly composed in his presence.

Approaching cautiously, Liam fought to conceal his inner turmoil, deliberately choosing a chair at a respectful distance.

"How's the baby? Everything progressing well?" Liam asked, his voice uncharacteristically gentle.

Olivia nodded, her hand instinctively moving to cradle her swelling belly. The tiny flutters and kicks had become more pronounced lately - a miraculous sensation that never failed to awe her.

Previously, she'd only seen her child during ultrasound appointments. Now she could feel every movement through her skin, a constant reminder of the life growing within her.

Liam's smile turned bittersweet as he clenched and unclenched his fists in quiet resignation.

"I know the child is mine. I was a fool before," Liam admitted.

Sebastian had revealed the entire truth to Liam after Olivia disappeared.

There had been a brief moment when Liam realized the baby Olivia carried was his. But fate intervened - he collapsed before making amends, that crucial memory erased by the drugs in his system.

Now that Liam had traced the source of the substances used against him, his enemies could no longer manipulate him with their chemical weapons.
###Chapter 259

As the drug's effects gradually faded, Liam began recovering fragments of buried memories.

Occasionally, Liam wondered how different life might have been if he hadn't collapsed that fateful day. Perhaps he and Olivia would still be together, raising their child in peaceful happiness. Being a devoted father and loving husband had always been his deepest aspiration.

Yet Liam understood with painful clarity that Olivia would have faced countless dangers had he remained conscious. His temporary oblivion about fathering her child had been their greatest protection, misleading his enemies completely.

Back then, with threats lurking in every shadow, he could barely protect himself - let alone shield Olivia.

Though every fiber of his being longed to keep Olivia close, Liam knew exposing her to danger was unforgivable. As head of the Blackwood family, he bore the responsibility of resolving generational conflicts, even when it meant becoming an unwitting target.

Thinking of Olivia's safety, Liam drew a steadying breath, wrestling his turbulent emotions under control.

At that moment, Olivia stepped forward and took Liam's hand.

His heart hammered violently against his ribs, his carefully constructed composure threatening to shatter. Yet he maintained an impassive mask, though turmoil raged within.

Olivia seemed unaffected by his apparent detachment. Gently, she guided his hand to rest on her rounded belly.

A sharp pang of sorrow pierced Olivia's heart, resurrecting painful memories. Yet simultaneously, an odd sense of closure washed over her - as if this might be their final meeting.

Olivia grappled with conflicting emotions, realizing her personal grievances couldn't overshadow the greater truth. This wasn't just about her baby - Liam was the father.

As Olivia pressed Liam's palm against her abdomen, overwhelming emotion crashed over him. The faint but steady pulse of their unborn child resonated through his fingertips.

The profound moment nearly undid Liam. Abruptly, he withdrew his hand and turned away, hiding his vulnerability.

"From today onward, this child is solely your responsibility," Liam declared, his harsh tone belying his earlier emotion. "Boy or girl, keep them far from the Blackwood name."

Though cruel-sounding, Liam's command stemmed from protective instincts, shielding their child from potential family conflicts.

Olivia responded with an understanding smile and quiet nod.

Liam then produced several crumpled papers from his pocket - divorce documents.

Normally fastidious, Liam had unconsciously crushed these papers repeatedly during his journey, betraying his inner conflict.

Avoiding Olivia's gaze, he spoke rapidly, fighting to control his voice. "Read carefully before signing."

He added tersely, "Before Henry passed, he left something for you. Margaret took it, but it'll be returned after the divorce. May you and the child find happiness. Just... don't come back."

Olivia's eyes dropped to the agreement, noting Liam's signature already gracing the page.

Emotions swirled violently as she studied the document.

After years of entanglement, their impending separation evoked conflicting relief and sorrow.

Part of Olivia had secretly believed they might never actually divorce.

Yet here it was - the official end transforming them into perfect strangers.

A slight lip twitch betrayed Olivia's lingering pain, though less intense than before.

She accepted the documents, her pen scratching decisively across the paper.

When Olivia returned the signed agreement, Liam seemed momentarily disoriented.

"You signed too quickly," he managed, voice thick. "Aren't you going to review the terms?"

Olivia shook her head fluidly, conveying absolute trust. She doubted Liam would manipulate conditions to trap her.

While Liam had made mistakes and occasionally overstepped, he'd always been transparent with her.

Reflecting on their turbulent relationship, Olivia realized what she'd once perceived as Liam's overbearing actions stemmed from her own belief in their unbreakable bond. Without emotional ties, his behavior wouldn't have seemed excessive. This understanding came too late.

As Liam prepared to leave, Olivia mustered a bright smile and waved, masking her heart's finality with cheerful pretense.

Liam caught her smile briefly before averting his eyes, clutching the signed papers tightly as he hurried away.

Exiting, Liam immediately noticed several vigilant bodyguards surrounding the area - unmistakably Donovan's men.

At that moment, Sebastian was attempting entry but being restrained by the guards.
###Chapter 260

Frustration burned in Sebastian's chest as he confronted the security team. "I saw you let Mr. Kensington through. Why am I being denied entry? This is blatant favoritism!"

The head guard remained impassive, his voice professional yet firm. "Our orders come directly from the top, sir. I suggest you take this up with management."

Liam approached swiftly, placing a restraining hand on Sebastian's arm before the situation escalated.

Sebastian's jaw clenched, his displeasure evident in every tense line of his body.

Once they'd moved away from earshot, Sebastian couldn't contain his frustration. "Mr. Blackwood, you shouldn't have made those concessions. It's obvious Donovan has reservations about you."

Liam's gaze remained fixed on some distant point as he responded in measured tones. "Donovan's wariness works in our favor. It means he's vigilant - exactly what Olivia needs for protection. His caution with me ensures he'll be doubly careful with others." A faint smile touched his lips. "Besides, public commitments from a Kensington aren't easily retracted."

Sebastian frowned. "But what if she's not actually related to the Kensingtons?"

Liam shook his head dismissively. "Even if that were true, he wouldn't reverse course now. The Kensington family needs stability, and Olivia provides that." His voice took on a bitter edge. "They're not like the Blackwoods. They actually care about their people."

Sebastian caught the unspoken comparison, exhaling heavily.

The implication hung between them - the Blackwood family's notorious emotional detachment, their cold corporate mentality.

Breaking the heavy silence, Liam suddenly commanded, "To the hospital."

Sebastian nodded briskly, opening the car door with practiced efficiency.

The scene at Mercy Hospital's VIP wing was tense when they arrived. The Kensington family stood clustered outside the critical care unit, their expressions grim. Evelyn appeared particularly distraught.

Richard and Victor were already present, the air thick with unspoken accusations.

Liam's calm entrance created an immediate contrast to the charged atmosphere.

Richard rounded on him immediately, his voice shaking with barely contained rage. "Mother nearly died in that accident! Where were you? How can you stand there looking so unaffected? Don't you care at all?"

At this, Victor stepped forward.

The left side of Victor's face remained hidden behind a medical mask, giving him an unsettling, asymmetrical appearance. His visible features were handsome but set in grim lines.

"Richard, let's remain hopeful. Mrs. Winslow is strong." Though Victor's words seemed conciliatory, his gaze fixed accusingly on Liam. "Though I must say, Liam, your demeanor is... remarkably composed for a son visiting his critically ill mother."

Before Liam could respond, Evelyn jumped to his defense. "That's not fair! Liam's been making arrangements this whole time. Just because he's not weeping in the hallway doesn't mean he's not concerned."

Liam nodded calmly. "Quite right. I've been making extensive preparations."

At Liam's subtle gesture, Sebastian produced several items from his briefcase - funeral urns, memorial cards, and other end-of-life arrangements.

The hospital corridor fell into stunned silence.
###Chapter 261

Richard's initial shock quickly morphed into white-hot fury. "Liam! What kind of twisted game are you playing? Have you been counting down the days until our mother's death? She's fighting for her life in that hospital bed. Have you no shame?" His hands trembled at his sides, veins bulging in his neck.

Liam's face turned to stone, his piercing gaze glacial. "Cut the theatrics. We both know why you're here. I've seen through your little charade since Margaret's so-called accident. Why bother pretending now?"

Cornered, Richard lashed out like a wounded animal. "You're delusional! That accident happened barely three blocks from your penthouse. Who wouldn't suspect you? And now you're not just wishing her dead, but trying to blame me? The audacity!"

A cold smirk played on Liam's lips. "Three blocks, you say? Fascinating precision. Weren't the security cameras mysteriously disabled that day? How then, dear brother, do you know the exact location?"

Richard's mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water, his face flushing crimson.

Victor sighed inwardly, mentally cataloging Richard's incompetence.

The silence stretched painfully as Richard struggled to form a coherent response, his earlier bravado crumbling.

Watching the exchange unfold, Victor realized their carefully laid plans were unraveling. With a subtle tilt of his head, he signaled Evelyn to initiate their contingency plan.

To his utter disbelief, Evelyn deliberately turned away, pretending not to notice his cue.

Victor's expression darkened like a gathering storm.

The air grew thick with tension, charged like the moment before lightning strikes.

Catherine's smooth voice sliced through the silence. "This isn't right, Liam. Richard has barely left Margaret's bedside these past days. We all know how devoted he is. Your accusations are cruel."

Liam's smirk deepened as his gaze locked onto Catherine. "Ah, Catherine. I'd almost forgotten you were here. Now that you've spoken up, I have a question for you too."

The unspoken threat in his eyes made Catherine's blood run cold.

Her mind raced through every secret, every deception. Had he discovered her role in misleading him about Olivia's pregnancy? But no, he wouldn't be this composed if he knew. Then what? What other skeleton had he dragged from her closet?

Her manicured nails dug into her palms as she braced for the blow.

At that precise moment, a harried doctor rushed into the waiting area, his face grave. "Is the Winslow family here?"

All eyes snapped toward him, the earlier confrontation momentarily forgotten.

Richard's face crumpled with what appeared to be genuine distress, tears welling in his eyes. "Doctor! How's my mother? Please tell me there's improvement!"

Liam remained impassive, observing his brother's performance with detached amusement. Never in thirty-five years had Richard shown such concern for their mother.

The doctor adjusted his glasses, his expression unreadable.

The tension in the room became almost palpable.

Then—

The heart monitor's flatline tone pierced through the hospital corridor like a death knell.
###Chapter 262

The physician placed a comforting hand on Richard's shoulder. "Your mother's condition is temporarily stable, but her prognosis remains uncertain. If there are any final words you wish to share, this would be the appropriate time. The vehicular collision caused catastrophic injuries, and she could expire at any moment."

Before the doctor finished speaking, a woman's choked sob pierced the tense silence.

Catherine Winslow stood weeping uncontrollably, her shoulders shaking with each ragged breath.

Richard's face mirrored his wife's apparent grief, every muscle taut with visible distress.

The weight of impending loss hung heavy in the sterile hospital corridor - except for one person.

Noticing the disapproving glances directed at Liam, Sebastian leaned closer and murmured, "Sir, perhaps some visible concern would be prudent?"

Liam's lips twisted into a sardonic smile as he whispered back, "Why perform grief when we all know the truth? They've scheduled Mother's demise for today regardless of her actual condition. Surely you don't doubt this?"

Sebastian bowed his head in silent acknowledgment.

Liam's icy gaze swept across the assembled relatives before issuing quiet orders. "Execute the contingency. Clean and thorough."

"Understood." Sebastian melted into the background as the family continued their theatrical mourning.

Richard wiped his eyes dramatically. "I'll handle this. As firstborn, any final wishes belong to me alone."

Liam intercepted his brother's movement toward Margaret's private room. "Don't be absurd, Richard. We share the same blood. Mother would want us both present."

Richard's jaw clenched. "You've barely visited during her entire hospitalization! Now at this critical hour, you suddenly appear? What's your true agenda?"

Liam countered smoothly, "My absence maintained Blackwood Enterprises. Shall we trade places? You manage the corporation while I play devoted son?"

Richard's expression brightened momentarily at the suggestion.

Before he could respond, an elderly Winslow cousin interjected, "Richard, you should enter together."

Richard's smile froze. Rage flickered behind his eyes, but he restrained himself - this distant relative still commanded respect.

His carefully orchestrated audience of relatives now worked against him. Though they disapproved of Liam's apparent indifference, none wished to see the incompetent Richard helm the family empire.

Standing apart, Victor Blackwood observed this dynamic with new understanding. He stroked his chin, reassessing his strategy.

After prolonged stalemate, Liam took decisive action. With one final dismissive glance at Richard, he strode into Margaret's room.

Richard moved to follow but found his path blocked by security. "What is the meaning of this?" he demanded.

The lead guard offered a polite but firm smile. "Mr. Blackwood requests privacy with his mother. Please wait your turn."

Richard's face darkened with fury. "What secrets is my brother hiding now?"
###Chapter 263

While Richard caused a commotion in the hallway, Liam remained unfazed.

Perched beside Margaret's hospital bed, Liam studied her with quiet intensity. "Mother?" His voice was featherlight, barely disturbing the sterile air.

At the sound, Margaret turned her head with deliberate slowness. Her whisper carried venom. "Finally gracing me with your presence? Come to witness my final moments?"

Liam's expression remained unreadable. "You've still got enough fire to insult me. The doctors clearly exaggerated your condition." His fingers tapped rhythmically against the armrest. "Let me guess - you've been mobile for days. Richard fabricated this coma story to manipulate me into visiting."

A shadow flickered across Margaret's face before vanishing behind her practiced mask of indignation. "Richard acted out of concern! Unlike you, abandoning your own mother for that scheming little—"

"Actually," Liam interrupted smoothly, "Richard specifically warned me against visiting. Claimed my presence might...aggravate your condition."

Margaret's lips pressed into a bloodless line. "And whose fault is that? I wouldn't be here if you hadn't arranged that 'accident'!"

Liam's phone screen illuminated his sharp features as he scrolled. "Did I really?" The question dripped with irony.

Margaret's brittle composure shattered. "How dare you! After everything I've sacrificed for you! That Olivia is poison - first seducing Henry, now ensnaring you—"

"Olivia," Liam cut in, voice glacial, "whom you've systematically robbed of everything that was rightfully hers."

"The Blackwood fortune was never hers to claim!" Margaret spat.

A humorless smile touched Liam's lips. "Before Grandfather adopted her, Olivia inherited substantial assets from her parents. Curious how the lawyer managing them...disappeared afterward." His gaze pinned her. "Others might not know what happened that night, Mother. But I do."

The memory struck Margaret like a physical blow. Twenty years ago, a nine-year-old Liam had hidden in the study's secret passage, overhearing his mother's damning phone call. That moment had planted the first seed of doubt in the child's mind.

Liam continued relentlessly. "Father was running Blackwood Enterprises into the ground back then. Yet you were buying Richard a hundred-million-dollar villa in Montecarlo while claiming financial hardship."

Margaret's skeletal fingers clawed at the sheets. The years of bedrest had hollowed her cheeks, making her rage-twisted face resemble a death mask. "What do you want, Liam?"

"It's not about what I want." Liam leaned closer, his whisper lethal. "It's about what you and Richard are plotting."

Three sharp raps shattered the tension. Richard stood in the doorway, panic barely concealed beneath his polished veneer.

Margaret seized the interruption. "Plotting? You're the one who tried to kill me! When the family gathers—"

"Ah yes," Liam murmured, "the grand performance." His chest constricted despite himself. This woman who'd favored Richard since childhood, who'd stolen from an orphaned girl - she was still his mother. The betrayal cut deeper than he cared to admit.

The monitors beeped erratically as Margaret's breathing turned ragged. "You'll regret crossing me, Liam. I'll make sure of it."

Outside, hospital staff scrambled toward the escalating disturbance in the corridor. The game was entering its final act.
###Chapter 264

Margaret Winslow's sharp eyes caught the unspoken thoughts flickering across Liam Blackwood's face. Without warning, she erupted into harsh laughter that echoed through the sterile hospital room. "That burning curiosity of yours - it's always been your downfall. Even as a child, you had that insufferable need to understand everything. Your intelligence makes everyone else seem dull by comparison. Your very presence chills me to the bone. When Richard speaks to me, there's warmth, affection. But you? Always so clinical, so detached."

Liam's eyebrows shot up in genuine surprise. "That's truly why?" His voice held a note of disbelief.

Margaret's laughter turned bitter, her lips twisting into a sneer. "There were days I wished I'd never given birth to you."

A humorless chuckle escaped Liam's lips, mingling with his mother's cruel amusement. So this was the root of her disdain.

Unlike his silver-tongued brother Richard who showered their mother with empty flattery, Liam had always believed actions spoke louder than words.

He could recite Margaret's preferences by heart - the exact shade of her favorite tea, the obscure French perfume she adored. Countless times he'd gone to extraordinary lengths to procure her desires, only for Richard to present them as his own gifts.

The stolen credit had never bothered Liam. Filial duty wasn't about recognition. Yet he'd never imagined that in Margaret's eyes, his quiet devotion translated as cold indifference. All his efforts, dismissed with a wave of her manicured hand.

Perhaps the bitter edge in Liam's silence struck a nerve. Margaret's face flushed with renewed anger, her fingers twitching as if itching to strike him.

The knocking at the door escalated into frantic pounding. Richard's muffled shouts penetrated the ward. "Liam! What the hell are you doing in there? Open this door immediately! What have you done to Mother?"

At the sound of her favorite son's voice, Margaret's expression brightened like a parched plant finding water. She opened her mouth to scream for help.

But Liam's voice cut through the tension like a blade. "You honestly believe aligning with Richard will secure your future? Open your eyes, Mother. You're nothing but a pawn to him - disposable the moment you cease to be useful."

"Don't be absurd!" Margaret spat, her hospital gown rustling with her agitation. "Richard cares for me deeply. Unlike you - cold, unfeeling. No wonder you'll die alone."

Liam remained eerily calm, his gaze drifting to the IV bag hanging above Margaret's bed.

Seeing his distant expression, panic flashed in Margaret's eyes. "What are you planning? I'm your mother! You wouldn't dare harm me! They'll lock you away forever if you lay a finger on me!"

This time, Liam's laughter held genuine amusement. "It's not me you should fear, Mother. It's Richard. If you value your life, tell him you've decided to recuperate at my estate."

Drawing a steadying breath, Liam's voice turned solemn. "Mother, I accept we'll never see eye to eye on many things. But blood binds us, and that cannot be undone. Let me be clear - choose my protection, abandon your schemes, and I'll ensure you live comfortably. But the lavish lifestyle you enjoyed? That's gone forever."

His eyes hardened. "You will also return everything you stole from Olivia. Every last cent belongs to her. You know how I operate - this will happen whether you cooperate or not."

"The choice is yours. Side with Richard, and you'll face the consequences of that decision alone. Don't come crawling to me when it all collapses."

Margaret hesitated, her mind racing. But Richard's increasingly frantic shouts outside the door seemed to steel her resolve.

###Chapter 265

Margaret Winslow sneered at Liam Blackwood. "You're the guilty one here, trying to silence me. That car identification stunt was your doing. Once I recover, I'll expose your true monstrous nature!"

Liam studied Margaret, her eyes wild with desperation. The last flicker of hope within him extinguished. The truth was, he had known about Margaret and Richard's schemes for some time. Always vigilant, how could he have been drugged? It was Margaret, his own mother, who had slipped him the sedatives.

Being her son, Liam had suspected everyone else—even Sebastian Montgomery—but never her. He thought their disagreements were just familial tensions. Never did he imagine she'd go as far as drugging him, disregarding his well-being entirely.

When he caught Margaret administering the drugs, everything fell into place. Liam realized then that she had long chosen Richard over him, treating Richard as if he were her only child.

Liam exhaled heavily before asking, "Did my father have an illegitimate child years ago? What happened to that boy and his mother?"

Margaret's tirade halted abruptly. Her eyes darkened with something sinister. "What nonsense are you spouting? Your father and I had a perfect marriage. There was never any illegitimate child!"

Liam gave a bitter laugh. "Really? Wasn't that child's name Victor? From what I heard, my father adored him and wanted to raise him properly outside the family. But you found out and flew into a rage. You burned down their home in your fury. Victor's mother died on the spot, and half of his face was disfigured. Later, Victor confronted you, demanding an explanation. After all, my father's will explicitly disinherited him, stating his existence was irrelevant to our lives."

"Yet, you spun a tale that I wanted him and his mother gone, claiming you acted out of indulgence for me. In truth, you made me the scapegoat for your crimes."

"Believing your lies, Victor's hatred for me festered over the years, becoming his driving force. Have you seen him since that day? Not only is he alive, but he's thriving."

"I don't know how he managed it, but he's now a key associate to some depraved noble in Valtierra. His miserable existence is fueled solely by his hatred for me—and for you."

"It's too late to set things straight. His resentment has twisted him beyond reason. If he goes down, he'll drag me with him. The crisis I'm facing now is the direct result of your actions."

Liam's tone was detached, as if recounting someone else's tragedy.

Margaret's eyes widened in shock. "Is Richard involved in this?" she asked nervously. "Will Victor seek revenge against him?"

Liam scoffed. "Absolutely not."

He wasn't being entirely truthful. Victor hadn't targeted Richard only because Richard was merely a pawn in his grander scheme.

Liam saw no reason to intervene. The inevitable clash between these twisted individuals would be catastrophic.

Guilt gnawed at Margaret, but the irreparable rift between her and Liam made explanations pointless. She cleared her throat awkwardly. "If you're done, leave. I don't want to see you. Instead of interrogating me, focus on damage control. I'll reveal the truth eventually," she muttered.

###Chapter 266

Liam let out a weary sigh. "Save your breath about transparency. Margaret never intended to let you speak," he said bluntly, his voice laced with quiet resignation.

Natalie's brows knitted together in confusion. "What exactly are you suggesting?"

Ignoring her question entirely, Liam turned on his heel and strode out of the hospital room.

Richard was lurking outside like a predator waiting to pounce. The moment the door opened, he lunged forward, grabbing Liam by the collar with trembling hands.

Liam's towering height made Richard's attempt at intimidation laughable.

Richard's eyes narrowed into dangerous slits. "What the hell did you say to our mother? One wrong word and you're finished!" he snarled, spit flying from his lips.

A slow, knowing smile spread across Liam's face. "Interesting how little trust exists between you and Margaret."

The casual way Liam addressed their mother by name, without an ounce of respect, made Richard's grip falter momentarily. Clearly, Margaret still held a grudge against Liam.

Not that Richard minded. He'd meticulously orchestrated the "accident" with Margaret's car, leaving no trace of the truth.

All the evidence he'd presented to Margaret pointed squarely at Liam as the mastermind. She should still be convinced of his guilt.

Releasing Liam with a shove, Richard flashed a smug grin. "Jealous much, brother? You think you've got it all, but you're nothing. Not even our mother wants you. How pathetic."

Liam remained as calm as still waters. His voice, smooth as aged whiskey, delivered its lethal blow. "Only losers call others losers, Richard. I don't want your garbage, yet you're obsessed with what's mine."

Richard's smirk evaporated like morning dew. "You'll regret this, Liam!" he exploded, veins bulging in his forehead. "Mark my words - I'll destroy you. You've clung to that CEO title long enough. My turn now!"

With that final threat, Richard stormed back into Margaret's room.

As Liam exited the hospital, he nearly collided with Sebastian.

Sebastian leaned in close, his whisper barely audible. "Everything's arranged per your instructions, Mr. Blackwood."

Liam merely nodded, the ghost of a smile playing on his lips. "Let's go."

Sebastian's forehead creased with concern as he murmured, "We're leaving? But they're planning to deal with your mother today and frame you for everything!"

A dry chuckle escaped Liam's lips, his expression unreadable. "I gave Margaret a choice. She refused. I have my own plans. They can't touch me."

As Liam spoke these final words, his gaze locked unexpectedly with Victor's across the hallway.

Noticing the ice in Liam's eyes, Victor responded with a taunting smirk.

Liam simply inclined his head in the barest acknowledgment before looking away.

The casual dismissal ignited Victor's fury.

Turning to Miranda, his eyes glinting with malice, Victor hissed, "Tell Richard to move tonight. Make it quick."
###Chapter 267

Miranda turned to face Victor, her eyes widening in shock. "Mr. Blackwood, wouldn't it be wiser to wait until tomorrow? Acting now might compromise your position."

Victor's jaw tightened as he struggled to control his rare outburst of anger. His glare turned icy as he snapped, "Just follow my orders! Who gave you the right to question me? And don't think I'm unaware of what you did the other day."

The threat in Victor's piercing stare grew more pronounced as he finished speaking.

Miranda felt an icy shiver crawl down her spine. She realized Victor must have discovered her failure to eliminate Olivia.

She understood her continued survival depended solely on her usefulness to Victor.

Yet a small, foolish part of her clung to hope - perhaps after all these years by his side, Victor might harbor some shred of affection for her.

With these thoughts swirling through her mind, Miranda turned and walked away. She could feel Victor's lethal gaze burning into her back.

At that moment, Liam instructed Sebastian to start the engine. Suddenly, Evelyn appeared.

Spotting Liam's car, Evelyn rushed forward and rapped sharply on the window.

"Liam." Her voice dripped with concern as she asked, "Are you certain you shouldn't stay at Mercy Hospital with your mother? My instincts tell me Richard and... well, that mysterious man. I believe they're planning something. Your mother could be in danger. It would be safer if you remained to watch over her."

Liam suppressed the disgust churning in his stomach and forced a tired smile. "Whatever their intentions, I need to rest now."

Evelyn's face fell at his words, disappointment coloring her tone. "But Liam—"

Before she could finish, Liam ordered Sebastian to drive away.

As the car pulled off, Evelyn stomped her foot in frustration.

Originally, the arrangement had been between Victor and the Hartley family - Victor would help Evelyn win Liam's heart in exchange for their cooperation.

Eager for the opportunity, Evelyn had jumped at the deal.

Later, her relationship with Liam had indeed grown closer, though unbeknownst to her, this was only because Liam had decided to play along - his acting skills far surpassing hers in authenticity.

As time passed, Evelyn gradually uncovered Victor's true intentions. He wanted Liam's position... and his life.

Realizing her terrible mistake, Evelyn knew with bitter certainty that even if she confessed everything to Liam - claiming she never meant to harm him, that insecurity had clouded her judgment - Liam would undoubtedly end their relationship. Betrayal was the one thing he could never forgive.

Moreover, Evelyn knew Liam's capabilities all too well. If he discovered her betrayal, he would make sure she paid dearly.

Though heartbroken at the inevitable loss of Liam and fearful of his retribution, Evelyn took some comfort in Richard's assurance that the Hartley family would be richly rewarded for their cooperation this time.
###Chapter 268

Evelyn knew with absolute certainty that her fixation on Liam had nothing to do with the man himself. It was his power as CEO of Blackwood Enterprises that kept her clinging to him. The moment he lost that position, she'd vanish without a backward glance.

Biting her lower lip until it nearly bled, she forced crocodile tears and murmured, "Liam darling, I know you're madly in love with me. But I've warned you. If you fall from grace, you'll have no one to blame but yourself. Only the ruthless thrive in this world."

Her mind raced with new strategies to cut ties with Liam once their grand scheme reached its climax. There would be no point maintaining their charade of a relationship after that.

The thought of their unconsummated relationship crossed her mind. Despite months of dating, they'd never crossed that line.

Evelyn had tried countless times over the past year, but Liam always resisted, insisting they wait until marriage.

At the time, she'd felt rejected. Now, she thanked her lucky stars nothing physical had happened between them.

Her phone vibrated violently. Beatrice was calling.

The moment Evelyn answered, her mother's excited voice spilled out. "Darling! I've found the perfect match for you. Harvard-educated, from old money - exactly your type!"

"Mother," Evelyn snapped impatiently, "I'm still technically with Liam. How would it look if he found out about this?"

"Oh, my naive child," Beatrice sighed dramatically. "Are you still holding out hope for Liam? He's finished this time. Do you know why I'm pushing this? I just learned Liam met with Olivia yesterday to finalize their divorce. It's over. Don't you understand what this means?"

Evelyn's breath caught. "Does this mean... he's going to propose?"

Beatrice's silence was deafening.

Rumors about Olivia being the long-lost Kensington heir had spread like wildfire.

Evelyn had heard them all. Claiming she wasn't jealous would be a lie. But she'd dismissed them - with the Kensingtons backing Olivia, she knew better than to make a move.

One thing puzzled her though. If Olivia was now a Kensington, why was Liam so desperate to divorce her?

The more she thought about it, the more her stomach twisted. Was Liam actually planning to marry her?

No sooner had she ended the call with Beatrice than Sebastian rang. "Miss Hartley, Mr. Blackwood requests your company this evening. Are you available?"

"I'm afraid not," Evelyn cut him off sharply. "My schedule is packed for the foreseeable future. Kindly inform Liam not to contact me unless it's a matter of life and death."

Sebastian was stunned speechless. Since when had Evelyn, who'd always jumped at Liam's every summons, become so dismissive?

As he relayed the message, he could already picture Liam's bewildered expression.

###Chapter 269

Liam's reaction was unexpectedly composed, as though he'd seen this coming all along. He stopped what he was doing and flashed Sebastian a smile - but not his usual practiced one. This smile reached his eyes, radiating genuine delight from within. "You see now, Sebastian? My deception was flawless."

As quickly as it appeared, the smile vanished. "She bought it too," he muttered under his breath.

Sebastian knew Liam meant Olivia. He sighed heavily, contemplating the complicated relationship between the two. Perhaps this was destiny's cruel joke. He silently prayed Liam would find closure soon.

In Sebastian's mind, it might be better for Olivia to remain with the Kensingtons rather than stay by Liam's side. That way, Liam could pursue his ambitions without hesitation.

Outside, storm clouds gathered ominously, lightning splitting the darkening sky as the first raindrops began to fall.

A sharp gust of wind made Olivia sneeze as she stood by the window.

"You should step back from the draft. We can't have you falling ill," Donovan's deep voice cautioned from behind her.

Turning, Olivia greeted him with a warm smile.

As Donovan moved to close the window, his voice carried resignation. "I've been trying to arrange Seraphina's return to Westhaven, but she's resisting fiercely. Given her delicate health, I worry forcing the matter might trigger a relapse."

He studied Olivia's expression carefully, searching for any sign of distress. To his relief, her calm eyes showed no trace of anger or discomfort.

Encouraged by her composure, Donovan continued firmly, "Don't concern yourself with this. My promise to protect you stands - I'll handle everything appropriately. The tension between you and Seraphina is undeniable, and while you haven't shared details, I can guess the source of her hostility. Regardless, my decision remains - she must go."

Olivia blinked in surprise at Donovan's unexpected stance. She'd braced herself for a request to tolerate Seraphina's presence, considering this was the Kensington estate. After all, he'd made public commitments to her welfare. She'd prepared herself to maintain a polite facade, avoiding confrontation if possible.

Donovan's determination to send Seraphina away was beyond anything Olivia had dared hope for. This unexpected support eased her lingering doubts about him considerably.

Feeling lighter, Olivia smiled and signed her response, which was quickly interpreted: "Thank you for your consideration. If this causes you trouble, don't force the matter. I'm safe here - she can't harm me."

Donovan's expression darkened with concern. "You don't understand Seraphina. When she fixates on something, she pursues it relentlessly, consequences be damned. She's cunning but lacks moral restraint. Don't worry - as her cousin, I know how to manage her."

Olivia nodded gratefully.

Changing subjects, Donovan's tone softened. "I'd be grateful if you could spend more time with Alistair, even if it's just quietly keeping him company. Since your arrival, though you've barely interacted, his appetite has improved. Your mere presence seems to bring him comfort."
###Chapter 270

Olivia acknowledged his request with a slow nod. She'd planned to visit Alistair sooner, but between recent events and her own health complications, time had slipped away. Her doctor had insisted on complete bed rest, and she'd promised herself she'd go see Alistair the moment she regained her strength.

Yet the prospect of facing Alistair filled Olivia with equal parts longing and dread after everything that had transpired. "Mr. Kensington," she signed carefully, "I'm deeply grateful for your kindness these past weeks, and I understand your hopes for Alistair's recovery. But I'm almost certain I'm not his biological granddaughter. If this truth emerges, it could devastate him. Perhaps I could visit under another pretense?"

Her concern for Alistair was genuine.

Donovan studied Olivia, his expression shifting through a spectrum of unreadable emotions.

While contemporary DNA tests might struggle to confirm their relation without Olivia's parents, Donovan had access to private medical facilities that could provide definitive answers if he pursued them.

Donovan knew Liam's theory held weight. Olivia was indeed part of the Kensington bloodline. She was his aunt's child.

He suspected Olivia entertained doubts about her origins but found the potential truth too overwhelming to accept.

With his aunt gone and the full story lost to time, Donovan clung to the hope that clarity would eventually prevail.

"Discussing this with Alistair wouldn't change anything," Donovan finally responded, his gestures carrying both understanding and quiet resignation. "Let's allow events to unfold naturally. I won't hold it against you if you're not my cousin. Everyone's journey is their own."

Relieved by Donovan's response, Olivia didn't press the matter further.

Following the housekeeper through the grand corridors, Olivia approached Alistair's private quarters. The hauntingly familiar strains of a piano concerto stopped her in her tracks, transporting her back to their first encounter.

The housekeeper whispered that before assuming control of the family empire, Alistair had been the Kensington family's most gifted artist. Had fate taken a different turn, he might have become one of the nation's most celebrated musicians.

Moved by the soul-stirring melody, Olivia chose not to interrupt, settling silently in an alcove to listen.

As the final notes faded, Alistair seemed to sense her presence. He turned with a knowing smile, his aged eyes locking onto hers. "Do you recognize this composition?" he asked, his voice carrying the weight of decades.

Olivia startled, instinctively pointing to herself in question.

Alistair confirmed with a nod before transitioning seamlessly into sign language, creating an intimate bridge between them.

His hands moved with practiced grace as he signed: "My memory has returned. I saw you first at the Hartley gala. Though my mind was clouded then, I felt an immediate connection to you—a warmth I couldn't explain. After returning home, I couldn't shake the conviction that you're Vivienne's daughter. The more I pondered it, the more certain I became."

Olivia's hands flew to her lips in shock. She gestured toward his ears, signing her surprise at his fluent sign language and recalling he'd worn hearing aids during their initial meeting.
###Chapter 271

Alistair Kensington's lips curved into a wistful smile, his eyes clouded with years of unspoken longing.

His hands moved gracefully as he explained how he'd relinquished most Kensington family duties to search the world for Vivienne and her child. During memory lapses, he'd adopt new identities - when they first met, he'd believed himself deaf and mute, hence the hearing aids and sign language.

Finishing his story, Alistair gave an embarrassed chuckle and pressed a finger to his lips. He added that Donovan remained unaware of this and preferred Olivia to keep their secret, not wanting to burden his cousin with worry.

The confession dissolved Olivia's tension, drawing genuine laughter from her. The atmosphere in the sunlit parlor grew noticeably warmer.

Olivia confessed she actually enjoyed hearing him speak, relishing the variety of voices around her. She expressed hope that someday her own voice might join the chorus.

Alistair nodded slowly, his gaze thoughtful and kind.

Their conversation flowed easily for the next hour.

Olivia's initial apprehension faded completely. The once-intimidating family patriarch now seemed nothing more than a gentle grandfather figure.

Though doubts about her true parentage lingered, Olivia had resolved that if DNA confirmed Alistair as her grandfather, she'd let go of past Kensington family grievances. For now, she chose to embrace whatever joy this temporary home could offer.

A frantic knocking shattered the peaceful moment.

Alistair's demeanor hardened instantly. With a subtle gesture, he summoned the housekeeper to answer.

Celeste Dumont stood trembling in the doorway, tears streaking her flushed cheeks. "Mr. Kensington, you must intervene! Mr. Donovan insists on sending Miss Seraphina away, and she's just suffered her third relapse today. You know how fragile her constitution is - continued episodes could prove fatal. Mr. Donovan refuses to listen to reason. He's completely misjudged Miss Seraphina's intentions. Only your intervention can prevent disaster!"

Alistair's silver brows knitted together. "Seraphina had an episode? Why wasn't I informed?"

Celeste averted her eyes. "Miss Kensington didn't wish to disturb your rest. She merely took her emergency cardiac medication and endured the suffering alone."

Displeasure colored Alistair's voice. "If she's ill, she should see a physician. What good does coming to me do? I'm no doctor capable of healing her."

Hope flashed across Celeste's face. "Then you'll permit Miss Kensington to stay?"

Alistair shook his head firmly. "You misunderstand. Donovan makes his own decisions, and never without careful consideration. He's undoubtedly arranged everything for Seraphina's comfort. Trust his judgment and follow his instructions. Why must you and Seraphina make such unnecessary fuss?"
###Chapter 272

Olivia watched as Celeste's expression twisted with exaggerated distress. "Miss Kensington never meant to cause any trouble, but—"

Celeste's face contorted further, her voice dripping with false sorrow. "She truly doesn't wish to leave you, Mr. Kensington. She cares deeply for your wellbeing."

Alistair let out a dry chuckle that held no amusement. "Don't mistake my age for senility. My memory serves me perfectly today. I distinctly recall Seraphina demanding to leave not long ago."

The dramatic tears stopped instantly. A flush of embarrassment crept up Celeste's neck, but she was in too deep to retreat now. "That was all just a terrible misunderstanding," she insisted.

Suddenly, Celeste's finger shot out, pointing accusingly at Olivia. "It's this woman's doing! Everything was fine between Miss Kensington and Mr. Donovan Kensington until she appeared. Since then, they've done nothing but argue. Miss Kensington became so distraught she fell ill. And Mr. Donovan only decided to send her away because this woman demanded it!"

The venom in Celeste's glare could have poisoned a well. She blamed Olivia for every ounce of humiliation she'd suffered recently. If only Olivia had stayed in her place instead of playing her clever games, none of this would have happened.

Seraphina had been furious, feeling utterly outmaneuvered by Olivia. Yet she couldn't unleash her rage publicly without losing face. So she'd taken it all out on Celeste instead.

Celeste had borne the brunt of Seraphina's temper, barely able to endure the constant berating.

Olivia observed Celeste's performance with mild amusement, though she hadn't expected to be so directly implicated.

She'd intended to stay out of this family drama, but seeing Alistair's darkening expression, she felt compelled to clarify matters.

Just as Olivia opened her mouth to explain, Alistair cut her off sharply.

"I may be old, but I'm no fool!" His voice cracked like a whip, making Celeste flinch.

Celeste's lips pressed into a thin line as she looked up at Alistair with nervous eyes.

Taking a steadying breath, Alistair continued in a more measured tone, "Return to Seraphina and tell her this: she remains my granddaughter. While I can overlook many things, I refuse to be treated as a doddering old man. Yes, I have my moments of confusion. Sometimes I don't recognize faces or recall my actions, and perhaps I've behaved foolishly at times. But if she finds acknowledging me as her grandfather too burdensome, then she's welcome to keep her distance."

Celeste's nerves visibly frayed. She forced an ingratiating smile. "Mr. Kensington, Miss Kensington respects you immensely! She would never deny you as her grandfather."

Alistair scoffed. "Then she should stop stirring up trouble and let me live in peace."

With Alistair's position made so clear, Celeste bit her tongue. She wanted to argue further but hesitated, stealing glances at Alistair before deciding retreat was the better part of valor.

Olivia felt she should interject, wanting to explain that she wished for Alistair to have harmony with his family, not discord because of her.
###Chapter 273

The words came from Alistair's lips before Olivia could even form her response. "Olivia, I understand your hesitation," he said with grandfatherly warmth. "Though our acquaintance is brief, blood ties or not, you'll always have a place here. This is your home now. No harm will come to you under this roof."

Olivia's breath caught in her throat. Medical confirmation of their relation still hung in the balance. The logical part of her mind whispered that she likely didn't belong to the prestigious Kensington lineage. Had Donovan kept this uncertainty from his grandfather to spare him distress?

After a weighted silence, Olivia chose to let the matter rest. This delicate conversation belonged between Donovan and Alistair. Besides, words failed her when it came to discussing the fragile possibility of kinship.

Meanwhile, Celeste's report sent Seraphina into a rage. A stinging slap echoed through the room. "Did you make absolutely clear to my grandfather?" Seraphina hissed. "How could he possibly choose to exile me?"

Celeste's eyes brimmed with unshed tears. "I delivered every word exactly as you instructed, Miss Kensington. I even emphasized how Olivia was causing trouble. But the moment I finished, he flew into a thunderous rage."

Seraphina's lips curled in contempt. "Does that impostor Olivia truly believe she can claim the Kensington name? Just wait. Her fraudulent little charade will crumble soon enough."

Shifting uneasily, Celeste ventured, "What should our next move be, Miss Kensington?"

Fingers massaging her temples, Seraphina's gaze turned glacial. "What options remain? Donovan is determined to cast me out. Even feigning illness won't sway him now." A dangerous thought flickered behind her eyes before she exhaled in resignation.

A knock interrupted them. "Miss Kensington, Mr. Kensington requests an update on your packing progress."

Seraphina wrenched the door open, forcing a brittle smile. "Tell Donovan he's choosing an outsider over his own flesh and blood. Is this how the mighty Kensington heir treats family?"

The response came measured and calm. "Mr. Kensington anticipated your question. He wishes me to convey this isn't about preference, but necessity. Furthermore, the lady in question is your cousin. He expects you to refrain from such remarks henceforth. Shall we assist with your packing?"

The mask shattered. "Get out!" Seraphina snarled, but Donovan's men stood their ground - their orders were absolute.

A new voice cut through the tension. "I'd like to see how Donovan justifies mistreating my sister."

Outside, the storm intensified. Thunder shook the manor as lightning illuminated Olivia's startled face.

Alistair intervened gently, "The weather worsens, my dear. You should retire for the evening. Should you need anything, Donovan will provide. Stern though he may seem, he's utterly dependable in family matters."

Olivia nodded, her expressive hands conveying she found Donovan both kind and considerate.

Alistair's smile deepened. "You're his cousin, after all. If he neglects his duties, I'll have strong words about how he's been spending his time."

###Chapter 274

Olivia hesitated for a brief moment, considering whether to reveal to Alistair that she might not be his biological granddaughter.

A sharp knock at the door shattered her thoughts before she could speak.

Winston, the family butler, entered with a respectful bow toward Olivia.

Assuming this was household business meant for Alistair alone, Olivia began to rise from her seat. But Alistair motioned for her to remain.

"You're family now. Stay," Alistair commanded in a tone that brooked no argument.

Olivia had no choice but to settle back into the plush armchair beside him.

"Sir," Winston announced, "Mr. Frederick Kensington and his family have arrived unannounced."

Olivia's brow furrowed. Frederick? She'd never heard that name before.

Alistair turned to explain. "Frederick is your second uncle. This will be your first meeting since he's been abroad until now."

His expression darkened as he addressed Winston again. "Why the devil has my son returned without informing me first?"

Winston shifted uncomfortably. "They arrived without warning. By the time we were notified, they were already at the gates. They've gone directly to Miss Seraphina Kensington's quarters. It appears to be a family reunion, and we couldn't intervene. Mr. Donovan Kensington seems particularly displeased, given Miss Seraphina's current... situation."

Alistair's jaw tightened. "The entire family?"

"Yes, sir," Winston confirmed. "They've even brought their private medical team for Miss Seraphina's care. They expressed concerns about your health and doubted Mr. Donovan's ability to manage affairs alone."

The temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees as Alistair's face became unreadable.

Olivia had never witnessed this stern side of the usually jovial old man. The transformation was startling.

After a tense silence, Alistair turned to Olivia with sudden consideration. "Would you like to meet your uncle's family?"

Every instinct screamed for Olivia to refuse, but she knew better. She nodded with forced enthusiasm.

Donovan had hinted that Alistair would likely indulge Olivia's every whim.

If she declined now, Alistair might postpone this inevitable meeting indefinitely. That would only delay the confrontation. Better to face them now.

Minutes later, Olivia followed Alistair's measured steps toward the grand hall.

The previously quiet mansion now hummed with unfamiliar voices and movement.

As they entered, Olivia's sharp eyes immediately catalogued the newcomers.

A distinguished couple stood at the center of the group. The woman's haughty gaze swept over Olivia before curling her lip in obvious disdain.
###Chapter 275

The couple was flanked by a striking young man and Seraphina Kensington.

The young man bore a resemblance to Donovan, but his charisma was more pronounced, his warm gaze instantly making Olivia feel a strange flutter in her chest.

Olivia remained cautious. This had to be Julian Kensington, Seraphina's brother.

A knowing glance passed between Seraphina and Julian.

Surprisingly subdued, Seraphina stood quietly to the side, though a closer look revealed a smirk playing on her lips.

That expression told Olivia everything. With her family's arrival, Seraphina wasn't going anywhere.

A wave of unease washed over Olivia. Unsure of Seraphina's next move, she resolved to keep her distance.

With Winston's assistance, Alistair settled into the grand chair at the head of the hall.

Frederick Kensington approached eagerly, his voice laced with cautious hope. "Father, you still recognize me, don't you?"

Alistair gave him a sidelong glance. "My mind is perfectly clear today."

Frederick's shoulders relaxed with visible relief. "Thank heavens! I knew it was wise of Donovan to bring you here for treatment. That boy is truly dependable, unlike Julian who's always off chasing frivolities instead of tending to family matters."

He threw a pointed glare over his shoulder at Julian as he spoke.

Olivia's initial impression of Frederick's family wasn't favorable, yet she found herself studying him. Was his concern genuine, or was he simply skilled at playing the crowd? Either way, he knew how to work a room.

She knew perfectly well that Alistair had been brought to this country during a crisis, with Donovan having to search tirelessly for him.

Yet Frederick painted a picture of the dutiful grandson Donovan, bringing Alistair here solely for medical treatment.

Julian stepped forward, his smile mirroring his father's—sly as a fox with a dangerous glint in his eyes. But his attention was fixed elsewhere.

His smile widened as he turned to Olivia. "Grandfather, this must be our cousin? Olivia Sinclair, if I'm not mistaken? May I call you Olivia? You're absolutely breathtaking. You have your mother's eyes. I remember seeing a portrait of my aunt when I was a boy."

Olivia recognized the flattery, yet Julian's unexpectedly friendly demeanor caught her off guard. She'd anticipated outright rejection from Frederick's family.

Frederick nodded and beckoned her closer. "Come here, my dear. Let me have a proper look at you. My word, you're the very image of your mother."

He hastily brushed away a tear, seemingly overcome by painful memories.

Seeing Frederick's distress, Olivia stepped forward, offering a polite smile to the others.

Gwendolyn Kensington cut in with a sneer. "Look at you all, acting so sentimental. She doesn't seem particularly thrilled to see us. We've been standing here like decorations, and she hasn't even offered a proper greeting."

Seraphina let out a loud, mocking laugh.
###Chapter 276

"Mother, really," Seraphina drawled, her voice laced with sarcasm. "Must you be so cruel? She can't speak."

Gwendolyn's perfectly sculpted eyebrows arched in mock surprise. Leaning forward, she deliberately projected her whisper across the grand hall. "A mute? Why on earth would they bring home a mute?"

"Shut your damn mouth!"

"Silence, woman!"

Alistair and Frederick roared simultaneously, their voices echoing off the marble walls.

Frederick shot his wife a venomous glare, roughly grabbing her elbow and dragging her aside. Gwendolyn stumbled in her designer heels, barely catching herself. "Have you gone mad?" she hissed, smoothing her chignon. "What's gotten into you? I'm merely stating facts! I knew your sister, and she was perfectly healthy. So how did she produce a mute child? Something's not right here, and I demand answers."

Olivia's initial tension eased slightly. She couldn't fault Gwendolyn for her suspicions. She'd never truly believed herself part of this illustrious family anyway. As long as they didn't actively harm her, their doubts meant nothing.

Julian, mortified by his mother's outburst, pulled her aside for a heated exchange.

Returning to Olivia, Julian offered a contrite smile. "My deepest apologies, Olivia," he said earnestly. "My mother has always lacked tact, much like my sister. Please don't take her words to heart. I've given her a proper dressing-down, and I assure you it won't happen again."

His sincerity seemed genuine.

Hearing this, Alistair's stern expression softened slightly, though his tone remained firm. "Consider Olivia's position. How would you feel being subjected to such cruelty?"

Julian nodded hastily. "Understood."

Olivia responded through her interpreter using sign language, her gestures graceful yet firm. "I'm accustomed to such comments. As long as our interactions remain limited moving forward, it's of no consequence."

Seraphina couldn't contain her derisive snort. "Father, Mother, Julian, don't look so shocked. Living with the Blackwoods has clearly given her airs." Her voice turned bitter. "Though with Donovan and Alistair's backing, who would dare cross her?"

Frederick, weary of the drama, cut in sharply. "Enough!"

Seraphina turned away in frustration when her father refused to take her side.

Gwendolyn seethed, her contempt palpable. "Look at her! Acting as though we're the ones begging for her attention. Life must have been hard on the streets, yet she carries herself like royalty. What exactly does she have to be proud of?"

Sensing the escalating tension, Alistair placed a protective hand on Olivia's shoulder. "Come," he said gently, guiding her away from the toxic atmosphere.

Left in the suddenly empty hall, Frederick, Gwendolyn, Seraphina and Julian stood amidst the lingering tension.

Frederick was the first to break the silence, attempting reason. "Why must you be so cruel to someone who can't even defend herself? Can't you see how much my father adores her?"
###Chapter 277

Seraphina Kensington scoffed, her cynicism dripping from every word. "Everyone knows Alistair's mind isn't what it used to be. Just because he's taken a fancy to some girl doesn't mean we all have to bow down. I refuse to acknowledge her."

Gwendolyn Kensington nodded in agreement, her lips curling in distaste. "Absolutely. She's clearly an imposter."

Julian Kensington sighed, rubbing his temples. "Even if she is, we should at least pretend in public. Though I must say... while she appears meek, there's an undeniable stubbornness about her. Is she truly naive or just playing games?"

Seraphina's eyes flashed with anger. "She's no innocent. I was the one who saved her life, and this is how she repays me? Whether you support me or not, I won't let her get away with this."

As Seraphina's rage escalated, Frederick and Julian exchanged exhausted glances, realizing their options were limited. With silent understanding, they motioned for the servants to escort the two women away to calm down.

Once alone, father and son remained in the study, voices lowered to barely audible whispers.

Julian leaned closer to his father, concern etching his features. "Father, Seraphina might not see it, but you and Mother must have noticed... Olivia bears an uncanny resemblance to Aunt Vivienne—"

Frederick cut him off with a heavy sigh. "You're right. She likely is."

Julian's eyebrows shot up in surprise. "But Seraphina was so convinced Olivia was a fraud before we returned."

Frederick's frown deepened. "Your sister never met your cousin before. And many people share similar features."

Lowering his voice further, Frederick's tone turned conspiratorial. "Regardless, the only ones who could confirm her identity are gone. You need to get close to her, Julian. She could be useful to us."

"Fake or real, we'll make her real," Frederick declared with finality. "If she stays with my father long enough, she'll serve our purposes."

Julian nodded, understanding the darker implications of his father's words. A sly smile played on his lips. "Understood."

His expression then shifted to concern. "But what about Seraphina's condition?"

Frederick massaged his temples, the stress evident. "I'm still searching for solutions. Just keep her calm. She's brilliant but volatile, and each episode worsens her condition. Watch over her."

"I will," Julian promised.

Before Olivia's return, Alistair had proposed throwing an extravagant recognition banquet in her honor.

Yet Olivia, sensing the political minefield such an event would create within the Kensington family, immediately declined.

Her refusal was firm, her body language screaming, "I appreciate the thought, but no thank you. Crowds make me uneasy."

Alistair's disappointment was palpable. His voice thickened with emotion as he pressed, "You're my granddaughter. After everything you've suffered, I want to make it right. If you refuse this, it feels like you're rejecting me too."
###Chapter 278

Alistair's abrupt departure after delivering his message left Olivia feeling trapped in a whirlwind of conflicting emotions. The weight of his words hung heavily in the air between them.

Desperate for guidance, Olivia decided to seek Donovan's counsel. She needed to voice her concerns about the upcoming gala and what it might mean for her position within the Kensington family. The fear of accidentally usurping someone else's rightful place gnawed at her.

Before Olivia could arrange to meet Donovan the next morning, Frederick and his family intercepted her in the grand hallway.

Frederick and Julian wore polite smiles that didn't quite reach their eyes, their formal demeanor barely concealing their true intentions.

Olivia mirrored their strained courtesy with an equally forced smile, attempting to excuse herself from the uncomfortable encounter.

"Olivia," Julian interjected smoothly, stepping into her path with practiced charm.

Olivia's expression immediately frosted over, her body language screaming discomfort at Julian's proximity.

The attendant stationed beside Olivia - ever vigilant in carrying out Alistair's orders - addressed Julian with professional detachment. "May I assist you with something, Mr. Julian Kensington?"

Julian blinked in momentary surprise before recovering his composure. "I came to apologize. Alistair was correct - we should have been more considerate of your feelings yesterday. We acted hastily without even bringing proper gifts. Today, we've rectified that oversight."

With a snap of his fingers, two servants appeared bearing elaborately wrapped packages which they presented to Olivia.

Julian gestured toward the gifts with an encouraging smile. "Please, take a look."

When Olivia hesitated, Julian sighed dramatically. "You don't seem to like us very much. That's my fault entirely. If these gifts don't suit your taste, I'd be happy to find alternatives."

His expression expertly blended concern with subtle manipulation, making refusal seem almost ungrateful.

Olivia studied Julian warily, weighing her options but sensing any protest would be pointless against his persistence.

With reluctant fingers, Olivia opened the boxes.

The first revealed an exquisite couture gown, the second a dazzling array of precious jewels.

At that moment, Seraphina could no longer contain her jealousy. "Those gifts must be worth at least thirty million," she snapped bitterly. "And that dress is custom-made!"

She shot Julian an accusatory glare. "You've never given me anything half as extravagant. Why would you shower Olivia with such treasures upon first meeting? Does she mean more to you than your own sister?"

Julian's smile turned conciliatory. "You've wanted for nothing since childhood, Seraphina. But Olivia has endured hardships alone. It's only right we compensate for lost time with the care she deserves."

Seraphina considered this, her anger visibly dissipating as the logic penetrated her jealousy.

Olivia stared at the extravagant offerings, her brow furrowing with concern. She shook her head firmly, her silent refusal interpreted by her attendant. "I can't accept these. They're far too valuable. Even as a welcome gift, they're excessive. Please give them to Seraphina instead. I simply couldn't."

Julian's tone turned earnest as he pressed his case. "I understand you're being modest, but please reconsider. If you refuse, I'll have to ask Donovan to persuade you. You know how persistent he can be. And if that fails, I'll go straight to Alistair. His greatest wish right now is to see our family united. I'm certain he'd want you to accept these tokens of our affection."
###Chapter 279

Olivia had no choice but to yield under Julian's persistent request. She gave a reluctant nod, her fingers tightening around her purse strap.

Julian hadn't forgotten his original purpose. He motioned for Seraphina and Gwendolyn to approach.

The two women's expressions froze with visible discomfort, their steps hesitant as they moved forward.

Gwendolyn spoke first, her voice strained. "I sincerely apologize for my words yesterday. There was no malicious intent. Please don't take offense."

Seraphina offered a tight smile. "Let's put this behind us and start fresh."

Olivia waved her hand dismissively, signaling the matter was closed. She needed to escape this awkward situation quickly - there were urgent questions she needed to ask Donovan.

As Olivia turned to leave, Julian fell into step beside her.

"Olivia, are you going to see Alistair?" Julian asked with practiced charm. "Would you mind if I joined you? I've procured some experimental medication that might help his condition. I'd like his physician's opinion. His recovery means everything to me."

Olivia suppressed a sigh as tension crept into her temples.

She had to admit Julian had shown nothing but courtesy since their meeting. Despite her curt responses yesterday and today, he'd maintained his composure perfectly. This realization stirred an uncomfortable twinge of guilt.

Yet no matter how polite Julian behaved, Olivia couldn't shake her instinctive wariness. Donovan might not articulate his care with flowery words, but his consistent actions spoke volumes. With Donovan, she felt an inexplicable sense of safety she couldn't explain.

Faced with Julian's expectant smile, Olivia found herself nodding despite her reservations. "Fine," she conceded.

Alistair's face brightened immediately when Olivia entered, but the warmth faded when he noticed Julian behind her. Still, he maintained his gracious demeanor.

"Grandfather, how are you feeling today?" Julian moved to Alistair's side, his voice dripping with concern. "I consulted several specialists and brought you this medication. Where's your doctor?"

Alistair gestured to Winston, who promptly summoned the physician.

After examining the medication, the doctor nodded approvingly. "This is remarkable - not yet commercially available. Mr. Kensington must have significant connections to obtain this."

Julian smiled modestly. "It was nothing. An old friend in the industry helped. The cost was insignificant compared to Grandfather's health."

The room murmured with admiration at Julian's devotion.

Olivia seized the opportunity to excuse herself. With Julian present, this wasn't the time for private conversation.

She needed to find Donovan immediately - to convince him to help persuade Alistair about the possibility she might not be biologically related to the Kensingtons.
###Chapter 280

Olivia was deep in thought when Donovan unexpectedly entered the room.

When Donovan saw Julian, his face momentarily darkened with irritation before quickly smoothing into his usual composed expression.

"Donovan!" Julian greeted with exaggerated enthusiasm.

Donovan merely nodded in response, his demeanor cool and detached.

His gaze shifted to Alistair and then to Olivia. Relief washed over him when he saw Olivia unharmed. The Kensingtons still valued their public image. Even if annoyed, they wouldn't dare harm Olivia with so many witnesses present.

A sincere smile brightened Donovan's handsome features as he carefully produced a medicine bottle. "Grandfather, I acquired this for you. Let the doctor examine it."

The attending physician gasped in surprise but quickly covered his mouth, realizing something.

Julian interjected, "Donovan, we truly are cousins. I didn't expect you'd also find this medicine and present it to our grandfather."

At Julian's words, Donovan glanced at the bottle in Winston's hand, his expression clouding slightly.

Julian continued, "Donovan, I recall mentioning this to you before. I know you have longstanding connections with the pharmaceutical company executives, and their headquarters are in Eldermere. I assumed you could obtain the medicine faster than me, so I held back. When I saw no action from you—likely due to your heavy workload—I took matters into my own hands. You don't think I'm trying to steal your credit, do you?"

Olivia noticed Donovan's chest rising and falling slightly. She felt puzzled.

Having encountered many people and detected much malice, Olivia could usually read situations instantly. She recognized Julian was setting a trap for Donovan.

But Donovan wasn't defenseless. He always countered arguments logically. His current silence suggested he simply didn't wish to engage with Julian.

Olivia struggled to understand. Julian and Donovan were cousins. Why was Julian making things so difficult? It was exhausting watching family members play games instead of being direct.

This realization only deepened Olivia's dislike for Julian.

Despite the faint smirk tugging at his lips, Julian maintained an air of feigned humility. His expression was so artfully crafted it made blaming him nearly impossible.

At that moment, Alistair cleared his throat. "Enough," he said, waving dismissively. "You both care deeply. There's no need to argue about who came first."

Alistair was gently urging them to drop their dispute.

But Julian seemed to miss the subtle hint.

A heavy silence settled over the room.

###Chapter 281

Olivia was desperately trying to think of a way to redirect the conversation when someone unexpectedly brought up the very issue troubling her.

"Grandfather, I heard you and Donovan are planning a welcome party for Olivia," Julian remarked casually.

The moment Julian revealed this unexpected knowledge, all eyes in the room - including Donovan's, Olivia's, and even Alistair's - turned toward him in astonishment.

Alistair, visibly surprised, demanded, "I did plan this, but how could you possibly know?"

With an effortless smile, Julian explained, "Donovan mentioned it to me, but that's beside the point. I believe we should proceed with the welcome banquet. There are still doubts about Olivia's identity, and this event would solidify her position within our family. The celebration would also prevent any future mistreatment she might encounter in society while serving as our way of making amends."

Alistair considered this perspective carefully, recognizing the potential advantages. He had long wanted to correct past oversights with Olivia, though he remembered her less-than-enthusiastic reaction to his previous suggestion.

At that moment, Olivia subtly winked at Donovan, her expression betraying discomfort about the proposed banquet, silently pleading to avoid what she considered an unnecessary fuss.

Noticing her unease, Donovan discreetly cleared his throat. "Grandfather, we must respect Olivia's wishes in this matter," he interjected thoughtfully. "If she's uncomfortable with the idea, perhaps we should reconsider."

Alistair paused, his brow furrowing as he weighed Donovan's words, acknowledging the importance of considering Olivia's feelings.

Julian, however, quickly countered, "That's true, but Olivia is far too considerate for her own good. She's not one for extravagance and always puts others before herself. If we leave the decision to her, she'll undoubtedly decline just to avoid inconveniencing anyone."

Olivia stared at Julian, shocked by his interpretation. While it was accurate that she disliked causing trouble, she realized Julian was skillfully manipulating the narrative to serve his own purposes, making any objection from her seem unreasonable.

Seizing the opportunity, Julian pressed his case to Alistair. "This might be our only chance. If we don't celebrate her joining the family now, people might interpret it as the Kensingtons not accepting her as one of us."

"It could appear she isn't truly welcome. Moreover, we always mark personal milestones with celebrations - birthdays, graduations, achievements. This event would also help Olivia establish important social connections, ensuring she has support and protection in society."

Julian's argument was polished and convincing, carefully crafted to appeal to both family pride and Olivia's supposed benefit.

Had Olivia not already been wary of Julian's motives, she might have mistaken his persistence for genuine concern.

Eventually, Alistair seemed swayed by Julian's reasoning. He motioned for Olivia to approach.

Reluctantly, Olivia rose and took the seat beside Alistair.
###Chapter 282

Alistair's voice carried a depth of emotion that resonated through the room as he spoke to Olivia. "My dear, please don't see this as an inconvenience. It's only proper that we celebrate your return to the family. I wish to formally recognize you as my granddaughter before all of society." His aged hands trembled slightly with earnestness. "With me by your side, no one will ever dare mistreat you again."

Olivia found herself trapped in the sincerity of Alistair's gaze, unable to immediately refuse his heartfelt request.

Donovan, noticing her hesitation, stepped closer and murmured in a voice meant only for her, "Grandfather has planned this meticulously. Perhaps we should honor his wishes with a small celebration." His fingers brushed lightly against hers in reassurance. "And if you decline, Julian will only persist. Trust me to handle everything - I gave you my word of protection, and I intend to keep it."

Olivia turned to study Donovan's face, her expression a mixture of gratitude and concern. She knew better than anyone the weight he carried daily.

Alistair often spoke of how Donovan shouldered the Kensington family's burdens alone. Now he was managing Alistair's medical care while sacrificing his own rest, yet still offering to arrange this celebration for her sake.

The thought of adding to Donovan's already overwhelming responsibilities pained Olivia. But seeing the unshakable determination in his dark eyes, she felt an unexpected sense of security, though a quiet sigh still escaped her lips.

Their conversation gradually shifted to lighter topics as they spent the afternoon with Alistair, discussing plans for Olivia's upcoming welcome banquet.

Throughout their discussion, Alistair repeatedly emphasized the importance of ensuring Olivia felt cherished and supported within the family.

Their visit lasted until the physician arrived, politely reminding Alistair it was time for his medication and rest.

As they departed the room together, Donovan and Olivia walked in comfortable silence, with Julian trailing several steps behind.

Donovan leaned slightly toward Olivia, his voice dropping to a whisper. "Be cautious around Julian. He's far more complicated than he appears, and not someone to take lightly."

Olivia responded with graceful hand movements, her sign language fluid and expressive. "I understand. You're the only one here I truly trust."

Donovan, who had painstakingly learned sign language for their private conversations, felt a surge of warmth at her words.

A rare, genuine smile softened Donovan's typically stern features - a stark contrast to his usual restrained expressions.

Julian chose that moment to catch up, his sharp eyes missing nothing. "How unusual to see Donovan so at ease. Olivia, you should know he's normally quite severe with me and Vivienne. It seems you've charmed even our stoic cousin."

The warmth in Olivia's eyes vanished instantly at Julian's words.

When Donovan turned to face his cousin, his expression had hardened into one of unmistakable impatience.

Without acknowledging Julian's comment, Donovan turned back to Olivia. "I have matters to attend to here. You should return and rest. We'll discuss the details tomorrow." Olivia nodded in understanding.

As Donovan strode away, Olivia offered Julian a polite but distant smile before turning to leave.
###Chapter 283

Olivia Sinclair had barely taken two steps when Julian Kensington moved swiftly to block her path, his expression shifting to one of wounded melancholy. "Olivia, we hardly see each other. Why this frosty reception? It almost feels like you have some personal grudge against me."

Wanting to diffuse the tension without escalating matters, Olivia quickly typed on her phone. "I apologize if I came across as distant. That's just my personality - I'm naturally reserved and prefer solitude."

"But you—" Julian started.

Anticipating his next words, Olivia cut him off with rapid keystrokes. "Donovan and I have spent more time together, which explains why I might seem more comfortable around him. Everyone, including Alistair, knows I'm introverted by nature."

She continued typing, "Please don't feel obligated to interact with me beyond what makes you comfortable. I'll make sure Alistair understands there's no issue on my part."

Julian's eyes flickered with something unreadable before he pressed on, unsatisfied. "Yet you haven't explained why you seem to actively dislike me. As family, we should present a united front. If there are grievances, let's address them openly. Otherwise, it could damage family harmony. Don't you agree?"

Seeing Julian's determination for a clear answer, Olivia sighed and rubbed her temples before forcing a convincingly bright smile.

Her reply was carefully worded. "My past disagreements with Seraphina may have unconsciously affected how I treated you. That was unfair, and I apologize. You're not Seraphina. I'm sorry if any previous coldness seemed directed at you."

Julian visibly relaxed, though a trace of sadness remained. "I was genuinely worried you harbored ill feelings toward me."

Deciding to play along with his charade to avoid his persistent shadowing, Olivia grabbed Julian's arm like an affectionate younger sister. She showed him her typed message: "Julian, have you forgiven me now?"

"Completely," Julian replied with tender eyes. "From now on, I'll treat you as my own sister."

Olivia typed with playful mischief, "Better than you treat Seraphina?"

Julian nodded firmly. "Without question."

They exchanged smiles, though neither reached their eyes. Each harbored their own hidden agendas.

To outside observers, the scene painted a very different picture.

Seraphina Kensington, watching their interaction from nearby, seethed with barely contained rage. "What's wrong with Julian? Is he seriously treating that impostor as his sister now?"

Celeste Dumont, noticing Seraphina nearing another outburst, intervened quickly. "Miss, please remain calm for your health. Mr. Julian Kensington promised to handle Olivia. You should trust him. This is clearly just an act."

She added soothingly, "You're his blood sister. How could he possibly care about that scheming woman who wronged you?"

Somewhat placated, Seraphina lifted her chin with haughty superiority. "Of course I'm his real sister. Olivia Sinclair could never compare to me."
###Chapter 284

A sardonic smirk curled Seraphina's lips as she observed the scene before her. "Just look at Olivia, basking in false security. Does she truly believe my cousin's sweet lies? How pathetically naive."

Celeste nodded in agreement, her voice dripping with contempt. "Absolutely. She endured hardships abroad only to return as an imposter, thinking she can manipulate the Kensingtons. But your elegance and grace are qualities Olivia could never hope to attain, not even in her wildest dreams."

Chuckling darkly, Seraphina toyed with her pearl necklace. A mischievous thought suddenly occurred to her. "Speaking of which, I recall Liam paying us a visit recently. Donovan refused to tell me the purpose, but I've pieced it together myself. Liam came to finalize their divorce."

Seraphina clicked her tongue in mock sympathy. "From what I heard, Olivia was merely adopted by the Blackwoods, living off their charity. Then she shamelessly seduced Liam into marriage, only to be discarded like yesterday's news. Now she's just another pregnant divorcée."

Celeste eagerly added, "Quite right. I'm curious what she plans to do now that she's been cast aside. Rumor has it she signed the divorce papers without hesitation."

Seraphina scoffed. "Why wouldn't she? The Kensingtons are lightyears ahead of the Blackwoods. She thought she was upgrading her social status, so she threw the Blackwoods away like trash. Besides, Liam's fortunes have taken quite the downturn lately."

Celeste lowered her voice conspiratorially. "Miss, if Mr. Blackwood continues to struggle financially, would you...?"

With a dramatic toss of her golden curls, Seraphina interrupted, "What exactly are you suggesting? Only the most exceptional men deserve my attention. I admired Liam for his business acumen. If he becomes destitute, he's worthless to me. Handsome features might be pleasing, but why would I settle for a failure?"

Her crimson lips twisted into a predatory grin as she added, "Though I'm not completely heartless. If he comes crawling back in desperation, perhaps I'll entertain myself with him for a while."

Celeste fawned, "Miss, your generosity knows no bounds."

Then, with calculated casualness, Celeste mentioned, "Mr. Julian Kensington is hosting a welcome banquet for Olivia. Miss, you might want to prepare accordingly."

Seraphina's smile vanished instantly. She replied through gritted teeth, "I'm aware. I'll comply with my cousin's wishes."

Under her breath, she seethed, "That Olivia, who does she think she is? She's nothing but a fraud, and I'll expose her sooner or later."

The day of the grand banquet arrived at last.

Though Julian had generously provided designer gowns and exquisite jewelry, Olivia had no intention of wearing them.

Donovan, ever thoughtful, had arranged for an alternative wardrobe and even hired a professional styling team.

Unfortunately, all three couture dresses Donovan sent were discovered mysteriously damaged - clearly the work of sabotage.

Winston, who had delivered the garments, was visibly furious. "Miss, rest assured I'll investigate this thoroughly. Whoever dared do this will face consequences," he vowed.

Olivia sighed, suspecting Seraphina's hand in this but choosing not to pursue the matter. Some battles weren't worth fighting.

Using graceful hand gestures, Olivia communicated her question, which was immediately interpreted by the attending maid. "If I don't have a suitable dress, may I wear one of my own? Please don't worry - I do have appropriate attire."

Winston shook his head gravely. "Miss, you may not be aware, but the Kensington family maintains certain... standards. All family members are expected to wear items valued in the millions to formal events. Anything less would invite gossip, and Mr. Alistair Kensington would take great offense. Now with Mr. Donovan Kensington overseeing affairs, any whispers of impropriety could prove problematic..."
###Chapter 285

Olivia Sinclair grasped the severity of the moment.

Winston stepped forward reassuringly. "Don't fret. I'll contact Mr. Donovan Kensington to arrange another gown. It may require some time."

Olivia stopped Winston mid-dial with a firm shake of her head.

She retreated to her chambers to retrieve Julian Kensington's gifts. The dress and jewels sparkled with breathtaking brilliance.

The attendant interpreted Olivia's silent question. "These were sent by Julian. Will they suffice?"

Winston's face broke into a delighted grin. "This is the work of a world-renowned designer - not merely expensive but utterly exclusive. Only three or four such dresses exist globally."

His fingers traced the jewelry's intricate details as he explained their provenance. "Mr. Julian Kensington has shown remarkable thoughtfulness in his selections. Wearing these would be perfect, and Mr. Alistair Kensington will be thoroughly pleased. He places immense importance on family harmony."

Given the circumstances, Olivia felt compelled to accept the lavish gifts.

She exhaled resignedly as Winston summoned the stylist with a discreet gesture.

Julian's chosen design cleverly concealed Olivia's pregnancy. Though only four months along with barely noticeable changes, the dress's flowing silhouette and cascading skirts eliminated any risk of unwanted attention.

Olivia's statuesque frame allowed the floor-length gown to drape elegantly without requiring heels.

When the transformation was complete, Olivia stared at her reflection, startled by the vision of refined elegance staring back.

Her usual understated style had been replaced by something extraordinary, accentuating her delicate features in ways she'd never seen before. Normally pretty in a quiet way, she now radiated undeniable beauty.

The luxurious attire didn't seem foreign on Olivia's frame. Instead, she carried the ensemble with innate grace and nobility, as though born to wear such finery.

Winston visibly caught his breath before his expression blossomed with pride. "The Kensington bloodline shines through unmistakably. Such poise can't be learned."

Then a shadow crossed his features, his eyes growing misty. He dabbed discreetly at the corner of one eye. "Olivia, you're the very image of Vivienne standing before me. It's as if time has folded upon itself."

Studying her reflection, Olivia felt emotions churning within. She'd seen photographs of her mother in youth, and the resemblance was uncanny. Could she truly belong to this family after all?

With a steadying breath and thoughts whirling like autumn leaves, Olivia composed herself and moved toward the grand hall.

The space buzzed with Crestwood's elite. To emphasize Alistair's regard for Olivia, every prominent family in the city had received invitations.

Before Olivia's arrival, the guests indulged in speculative whispers.

"Could Olivia Sinclair truly be Alistair Kensington's granddaughter?"
###Chapter 286

The murmurs in the grand ballroom grew louder as guests exchanged knowing glances. "It's hard to believe. She used to live with the Blackwoods, and now suddenly she's a Kensington?"

"True or not, her background means nothing here. At most, she's the daughter of Alistair's only child. She doesn't carry the Kensington name. I doubt the family truly respects her. This whole banquet is probably just for show."

"Don't forget about Olivia and Liam's disastrous marriage. Evelyn has been interfering constantly. If the Kensingtons really cared about Olivia, wouldn't they have confronted the Blackwoods by now?"

"Oh, the scandal!"

Evelyn, overhearing the whispers, felt her blood boil. Her perfectly manicured nails dug into her palms as she stormed toward the gossiping women, her designer gown swishing dramatically.

"Enough with your pathetic rumors! I've told you before - Liam and I are soulmates. Olivia means nothing. That conniving witch trapped him into marriage using her family's connections."

"The Kensingtons are too ashamed to defend her. Besides, her so-called identity is clearly fabricated. The Blackwoods hinted her mother came from nothing. Maybe Olivia slept her way into this fake persona."

Instead of joining Evelyn's tirade, the women exchanged amused smirks, their champagne glasses clinking softly.

One bold socialite countered, "Word is you've got a new man, Miss Hartley. Congratulations. Weren't you the one who swore you'd never marry anyone but Liam? What changed now?"

"Can't you see? Miss Hartley always chases the highest bidder," another chimed in. "Years ago, she left Liam for better prospects abroad, only to come crawling back when she realized he was her best option. Now that Liam's inheritance is in jeopardy and he might get disowned completely, of course she's looking elsewhere."

Evelyn's face contorted with rage. Her voice trembled as she snapped, "How dare you say such things!"

But her protest fell on deaf ears. The women had already turned away, continuing their conversations as if she didn't exist.

Many in Crestwood's elite circles had disapproved of Evelyn's meddling in Liam and Olivia's marriage.

In their world, power dictated everything. Liam had once been the golden boy, and no one in Crestwood could rival the Blackwood family's influence. Back then, no one would dare cross Evelyn, who was seen as Liam's chosen one.

But the tides had turned since Evelyn dumped Liam. Watching him lose his status and seeing Evelyn jump to another man had made her the subject of scorn among their peers.

While they wouldn't confront her directly, their cutting remarks left no doubt about their disdain.

Feeling the weight of judgmental stares, Evelyn burned with humiliation. Wasn't Olivia supposed to be the one suffering? Why had everything gone so wrong? To her fury, Olivia - that scheming bitch - had somehow become part of the prestigious Kensington family, living in luxury beyond imagination.

Just then, Evelyn's phone buzzed sharply in her clutch.

"Mother, what is it? I told you I'm busy today," she hissed into the phone, her voice dripping with irritation.

###Chapter 287

Beatrice's voice cut through the phone like a whip. "You'll find time, Evelyn. I've handpicked this match for you. Don't disappoint me."

Evelyn's question came out in a hopeful whisper. "Is his fortune comparable to Liam's?"

A derisive chuckle escaped Beatrice. "Be realistic, darling. Liam chose you out of genuine affection. Our family may be wealthy, but we don't move in the highest circles. This man may not be as rich as Liam Blackwood, but he's respectable. Marrying him will elevate your status. It's the best you can hope for."

The disappointment weighed heavy in Evelyn's chest.

Noticing her daughter's silence, Beatrice scoffed. "What? Not good enough for you? Fine, reject my arrangement then. But remember - if you stay with Liam, you're choosing poverty. The Winslow family is about to disown him over his mother's death. No criminal charges, but not a penny of inheritance either. You'll become the laughingstock of Crestwood."

Evelyn clenched her phone tighter. Her mother's words stung with truth. "Fine," she conceded. "Invite him to the gala. I'll introduce him to society."

"That's my girl," Beatrice purred. "I'll have him there within the hour."

The call ended, leaving Evelyn unsettled. If only she'd been born a Kensington, with their limitless wealth and power. Then she could have any man she desired.

Moments later, her phone chimed with the suitor's profile. When she read "Westhaven nobility" in his bio, her eyes lit up with sudden interest.

The realization struck her like lightning - the Kensingtons built their empire in Westhaven. Their headquarters stood there. No matter how powerful the family was, they'd think twice before crossing a Westhaven noble if they wanted to maintain their comfortable lifestyle there.

A new confidence straightened Evelyn's spine.

Across town, the Winslow household buzzed with similar tension.

Richard and Victor were preoccupied with finalizing Liam's expulsion from the family, leaving Catherine as the sole representative at the Kensington gala welcoming Olivia.

Truth be told, Catherine would rather be anywhere else.

News of Olivia Sinclair's acceptance into the prestigious Kensington family had spread through Crestwood like wildfire.

Catherine had initially refused to believe it. The girl who was supposed to be as miserable as Liam? The one Victor claimed to have captured? Not only had she returned unscathed, but as the long-lost heiress to a fortune?

Remembering her past actions against Olivia, Catherine's palms grew damp. Would the girl seek revenge? The uncertainty gnawed at her as her manicured nails bit into her palms.

The evening's main attraction made her grand entrance soon after.

When Olivia appeared in her exquisite gown, every eye in the ballroom turned toward her.

###Chapter 288

The mocking whispers and doubtful glances came to an abrupt halt.

Any discerning eye could see Olivia's outfit was worth a fortune - easily valued over fifty million dors.

Even Evelyn and Catherine couldn't suppress their envy.

Evelyn particularly felt the bitter sting of jealousy. Her fingers dug into her own gown's fabric so hard it nearly tore.

"That insufferable wretch! Who does she think she is, flaunting herself like royalty?" Evelyn seethed internally.

While everyone knew the Kensington family's immense wealth, Olivia's extravagant attire for a simple banquet still took everyone's breath away.

Her entourage was even more impressive - an army of staff including maids, physicians, and chefs, every possible attendant one could imagine.

As some guests whispered, this was all due to Alistair's deep affection for Olivia. Now that she was pregnant, his doting had reached new heights. Each attendant had specific duties to ensure her comfort throughout the pregnancy.

Olivia's gaze swept across the crowd. Certain faces triggered a storm of emotions within her. Those who had once mocked and scorned her now regarded her with awe and deference.

The lesson was clear - in this world, wealth and power commanded respect.

Today, Alistair was in unusually high spirits. His illness hadn't flared up since Olivia's return.

Leaning on an attendant for support, Alistair stood proudly beside Olivia, his eyes shining with paternal pride. "You truly are my granddaughter. You resemble your mother so much. Your bearing carries the unmistakable stamp of the Kensington bloodline."

Other Kensington relatives trailed behind them.

Though Seraphina had prepared herself, seeing the radiant Olivia still made her jaw clench in bitterness. She shot Julian a look heavy with accusation.

Julian dipped his head slightly and murmured a warning only they could hear, "Remember our plans. Don't let petty jealousy ruin everything."

Seraphina felt wronged. "Julian, do you ever consider my feelings? At events like these, I used to be the center of attention. Even if this is part of our scheme, you're favoring Olivia too much. Do you actually see her as family now? Why won't you speak up for me? I'm starting to doubt your loyalty."

Julian frowned, his voice laced with impatience as he scolded quietly, "This is exactly why you'll never achieve greatness. You can't even handle this minor setback. How can I expect you to accomplish anything significant? Normally you're so sharp, but jealousy makes you lose all reason."

Julian rarely spoke so harshly to Seraphina. His words made her eyes well up with tears.

Clenching her teeth, Seraphina huffed and stepped away.

Watching her reaction, Julian could only sigh inwardly, feeling helpless.

Meanwhile, Alistair guided Olivia through the crowd, introducing her to Crestwood's elite as his beloved granddaughter.
###Chapter 289

The golden chandeliers of the ballroom cast shimmering reflections across Olivia Sinclair's champagne flute as she stood beside Alistair Kensington. Though she'd never spoken of her painful past to the elderly gentleman, Donovan Kensington had discreetly uncovered every detail.

Olivia had been orphaned before her tenth birthday. During Henry Winslow's lifetime, she'd known comfort and security. But after his passing, the mute girl had suffered countless indignities without the ability to voice her pain.

Alistair knew every injustice Liam Blackwood and Evelyn Hartley had inflicted upon Olivia. He'd tolerated their existence only because they weren't worth his attention. But tonight, watching Evelyn's approach, he silently vowed that any further provocation would meet with swift retribution.

His steel-gray eyes hardened like tempered blades.

Evelyn appeared then, clinging to the arm of a biracial gentleman whose sharp cheekbones gave him an aristocratic air despite his average looks. Her crimson lips stretched in a smile too wide to be genuine.

"Ms. Sinclair," Evelyn purred, raising her glass in mock salute. "What an unexpected pleasure."

Olivia's gaze flickered over Evelyn with glacial indifference before turning away.

The dismissal made Evelyn's smile twitch. Nearby, someone muffled a laugh into their cocktail.

Alistair adjusted his cufflinks with deliberate slowness. "Miss Hartley, unless you have business with my granddaughter, I suggest you find more suitable company." His voice carried the quiet authority of a man accustomed to obedience.

Evelyn's cheeks flushed wine-dark, but she held her ground. With theatrical grace, she gestured to her companion. "Lord Kensington," she simpered, pitching her voice to carry, "surely you remember our connection? At your birthday gala, you told Donovan I made quite the impression. I stood at your right hand all evening."

Murmurs rippled through nearby guests as memories surfaced. Indeed, Evelyn had basked in reflected glory that night, her proximity to Alistair granting her temporary status.

Across the room, Seraphina Kensington's fingers tightened around her clutch. "That scheming little—"

"Patience, Miss Kensington," Celeste Dumont murmured, restraining her employer. "Let's see how the mute girl handles this."

Seraphina's lips curled. "I detest Olivia, but Evelyn's insufferable. This should be entertaining."

Alistair's brow furrowed as he searched his memory. The birthday celebration had been clouded by personal turmoil, leaving only vague impressions of Evelyn - and an inexplicable revulsion he couldn't quite place.

To Evelyn, his hesitation read as confirmation. Her smirk widened victoriously.

The biracial gentleman cleared his throat, drawing attention. "Dominic Laurent," he introduced himself with a slight bow. "Evelyn's spoken so much about your family's... unique dynamics."

Olivia's fingers twitched against her skirt. Alistair's posture grew rigid, recognizing the veiled insult. The air between the four crackled with unspoken challenges.

Evelyn's eyes glittered with malicious triumph as she took a deliberate sip of champagne, savoring the tension she'd created. Around them, party guests leaned closer, sensing the brewing storm between the Kensington heir and the social climber who dared challenge her.
###Chapter 290

Evelyn tightened her grip on Dominic's hand, raising her voice with deliberate emphasis. "Let me introduce someone special. This is my new partner, Dominic Laurent, a noble from Westhaven. I believe the Kensington family has business interests there as well, isn't that right, Mr. Kensington? I thought you might appreciate making his acquaintance."

Her words dripped with smug satisfaction as she shot Olivia a triumphant glance.

Olivia barely suppressed her amusement, stepping back to observe the unfolding spectacle with quiet amusement.

Alistair studied Evelyn with growing bewilderment.

Blind to his reaction, Evelyn continued her self-important speech. "Establishing connections with Westhaven's aristocracy could prove advantageous for the Kensington family's ventures. There's no need for pretense, Mr. Kensington. While I may have grievances with Olivia regarding past... misunderstandings, I still respect her enough to extend this opportunity. Consider it a gesture of goodwill."

With a subtle tug on Dominic's hand, Evelyn signaled for him to make his presence known.

To everyone's astonishment, Dominic stepped forward and executed a formal bow toward Alistair, greeting him in perfect Westhaven dialect. "Good evening, Mr. Kensington."

At this display of respect, Alistair finally acknowledged him with a slight nod, his expression unreadable.

Nearby, Evelyn's face froze in shock, sensing the sudden shift in atmosphere. Dominic's unexpectedly deferential attitude toward Alistair only fueled her growing irritation.

Pulling Dominic aside, Evelyn hissed through clenched teeth, "I told you to command respect, not grovel. You're nobility! Alistair's just a merchant who happens to do business in Eldermere. Why show him such deference? You should be demonstrating your superiority."

To her utter shock, Dominic violently wrenched his hand away. "Have you gone completely mad? You expected me to disrespect Mr. Kensington? Are you out of your mind or do you think I am?"

Evelyn gaped at Dominic, her eyes wide with disbelief. "Why are you acting so... servile? You're aristocracy! What could possibly make you fear him?"

Dominic's finger jabbed toward Evelyn in furious accusation.

"I initially found you charming and intriguing, but now I see you for what you truly are - shallow and foolish. Alistair wields more influence in Westhaven than my entire family. As nobility, we must maintain good relations with him."

"He's your countryman who's achieved remarkable success abroad. Alienating him risks diplomatic tensions between our nations. Do you take me for an idiot? Are you truly this stupid? You'd sacrifice your own people's interests for petty personal rivalries. You're contemptible!"

Dominic's scathing words left Evelyn trembling with humiliation and fear.

Though Dominic lacked Liam's charisma and power, his noble status had still held undeniable appeal.

Now Evelyn realized her miscalculation with devastating clarity. "I... I didn't mean..." she stammered, tears welling in her eyes.

Evelyn couldn't comprehend how her attempt to one-up Olivia had backfired so spectacularly. She refused to accept that Olivia might genuinely hold higher status. It had to be some elaborate deception.

Desperate to salvage the situation, Evelyn reached for Dominic's hand again, but he brushed her off with visible disgust and stormed away.

The entire exchange had drawn an audience, and now muffled laughter and pointed whispers followed Evelyn as she stood alone in the center of the room.

###Chapter 291

Evelyn was mortified, yet the true humiliation was just beginning.

From across the grand hall, Seraphina observed Evelyn's predicament with cold amusement, flanked by her usual entourage of bodyguards.

Evelyn looked up to meet Seraphina's icy gaze, her stomach twisting with dread.

"Explain this disgrace," Seraphina commanded her guards, voice dripping with contempt. "How did this gutter trash slip past security? She's an embarrassment to the Kensington name. Remove her immediately."

Evelyn's face burned with rage. "This is Olivia's welcome banquet! Who gave you the right—"

"Right?" Seraphina's laugh was sharp as broken glass. "Let me ask you something, Evelyn. Who do you think you are now that Liam's been disowned? The way you dropped him the moment he lost his fortune—tell me, how many people here actually respect you?"

Olivia had been approaching when the words struck her like a physical blow. Liam... disowned? Her steps faltered. That explained why Evelyn had arrived tonight with another man on her arm, proudly introducing him as her boyfriend.

She'd assumed it was just another lovers' quarrel. Not this.

Oddly, the revelation brought no satisfaction. Instead, Olivia felt an unexpected pang—remembering Liam's proud bearing, imagining the depth of his current humiliation.

With a quiet sigh, Olivia turned away. This wasn't her battle to fight.

A sharp gesture from Seraphina sent her guards moving. They seized Evelyn mid-protest, dragging her toward the exits as she screamed obscenities.

Though Seraphina's methods were extreme, no one intervened. Several guests reported the incident to Alistair, who merely smiled faintly. "Let the young settle their own disputes," he murmured. "An old man shouldn't interfere."

Evelyn was thrown out before Crestwood's elite, her disgrace immortalized by flashing cameras. The reporters might not know the full story yet, but tomorrow's headlines would ensure all of high society did.

Clenching her fists, Evelyn seethed—never imagining she'd experience the same humiliation she'd once inflicted on Olivia.

Meanwhile, Olivia returned to Alistair's side, her expression troubled.

"Are you unwell?" Alistair asked gently.

Olivia gestured quickly: "I need air."

Understanding, Alistair nodded to a nearby guard, who fell into step behind her as she moved toward the terrace.
###Chapter 292

Olivia immediately shook her head, her expression firm as she declined the company. She needed solitude.

The Kensington estate was impenetrable. Even Seraphina, with all her malice, wouldn't risk making a move here.

Olivia was right about that much. But while physical harm was off the table, Seraphina had other, more subtle schemes in motion.

Word of Olivia's isolation traveled swiftly to Julian.

A slow, calculating smile spread across Julian's face as he turned to Seraphina. "This is our opening. I've been searching for the perfect opportunity - fate has delivered it to us."

Seraphina bit her lip, uncertainty flashing in her eyes. "Are you absolutely certain this will work, Julian?"

His expression darkened. "You're missing the strategic advantage here. I wouldn't waste my time on a lost cause. Yes, Donovan and Alistair favor Olivia, but as you've said yourself - she's an imposter. They're clinging to any semblance of family legacy. But you? You're Alistair's true granddaughter. Your lineage is undisputed, and your delicate health is well-documented. Find a secluded spot, provoke her into an argument, then collapse dramatically. I'll arrive just in time to 'save' you. The family will see Olivia for the viper she is."

Though doubts lingered, Seraphina acquiesced under Julian's impatient glare.

At least Julian would be there, she told herself. That was some comfort - better than facing this alone.

She stood abruptly, smoothing the expensive fabric of her designer gown with irritation. "I should never have worn this dress. All this effort wasted on an outfit for a performance."

Their eyes met in silent understanding. "Julian," she said quietly, "don't fail me."

His answering smile was thin but reassuring. "I won't."

As Olivia stepped into the hallway, she nearly collided with Winston.

The butler approached with urgency. "Miss Sinclair, Mr. Donovan Kensington requests your presence immediately. Would you spare him a moment?"

Confusion flickered across Olivia's face, but she nodded in agreement.

Winston led her to a private study where Donovan waited, an ornate lacquered box resting beside him. His expression was unreadable.

With a gesture, Donovan indicated the box.

Olivia shook her head, quickly typing on her phone. "You've all been too generous already. I can't accept more gifts. My gratitude is enough."

Donovan's response was firm. "This isn't from me. An anonymous benefactor insisted it be delivered privately."

A flutter of anticipation stirred in Olivia's chest. "Someone I know?" she typed, curiosity winning over hesitation.

Donovan gave a solemn nod. "The choice is yours. I can return it unopened. But if you accept, there's a message to deliver."

Olivia's fingers hovered over the box's clasp. She thought she knew who had sent it.

###Chapter 293

The room was hushed as Olivia approached the ornate wooden box with cautious steps. Her fingers trembled slightly as they hovered over the intricate carvings.

There, etched into the dark mahogany, was her name - Olivia Sinclair.

The grooves were worn smooth from repeated touch, telling a story of countless moments when someone had traced these very letters.

A shiver ran down her spine as she realized the implications. Liam Blackwood, the man who had always maintained emotional distance, had created this personal artifact.

Their marriage had been devoid of affection, yet the craftsmanship bore Liam's unmistakable signature. She'd loved him too long, too deeply, to mistake his handiwork.

Olivia clutched the box tighter, convincing herself it must have been made during their brief courtship, when hope still lingered between them. Back when she'd foolishly believed he might care.

Hot tears threatened to spill, but she blinked them away, caught between nostalgia and heartache.

Donovan Kensington observed her internal struggle but wisely remained silent, slipping out of the room with quiet footsteps.

At the threshold, he paused and turned back. "I know you've been pretending," his voice carried unexpected warmth, "but the truth is undeniable. This is your home. We are your family. No Kensington should ever feel like an outsider here." He took a measured breath. "Starting today, you have permission to make mistakes. Whatever comes, you'll have my full support. Just be true to yourself."

Olivia's pulse quickened. She met Donovan's steady gaze, seeing genuine sincerity that sparked something long dormant within her.

Once Donovan left, Winston couldn't contain his skepticism. "Mr. Kensington," he began with poorly concealed disapproval, "she's clearly rejecting the Kensingtons because of her mother's past. Why go to such lengths for her? The girl doesn't appreciate all we've done."

"Winston!" Donovan's sharp rebuke cut through the air. "The Kensingtons owe her and her mother more than we can ever repay. Have you forgotten what Seraphina nearly did? Olivia showed remarkable restraint by not pressing charges that could have ruined her. We will not make her burden heavier."

Winston flushed with shame. "My apologies, sir."

Donovan exhaled slowly, his expression softening. "My aunt saved my life. Though we rarely met, I remember her kindness clearly. Without her intervention, I wouldn't be standing here today." His voice dropped to a whisper. "We owe Olivia more than she'll ever know."

Alone in the quiet room, Olivia stared at the unopened box for what felt like hours. In the end, she couldn't bring herself to lift the lid, though she cradled it close to her chest. Whatever Liam's intentions had been, she wanted their story to end with dignity, not more heartbreak.

Meanwhile, Liam stood at the service entrance of the sprawling Kensington estate, his gaze traveling up the imposing stone facade.

Though the family rarely resided in Eldermere, their ancestral home remained a monument to their power and legacy.

His expression remained carefully neutral, betraying none of the turmoil beneath the surface. Only his eyes, dark with unspoken emotion, revealed the truth of his inner storm.
###Chapter 294

The room fell silent for a long moment before Liam finally spoke, his voice unwavering. "Olivia will be perfectly safe as long as she remains here."

Sebastian, standing nearby, tilted his head curiously. "I wonder if she's even opened your present, considering all the drama between you two..."

Liam gave a tired smile. "It's the least I can do for her now. Keeping her out of harm's way is my only priority."

His phone suddenly vibrated with an incoming call. Richard.

When Liam answered, mocking laughter immediately filled the air.

"Well well, little brother. How's life in the gutter treating you? Found any good cardboard boxes to sleep under tonight?"

Before Liam could respond, Richard continued his taunts. "Oh wait - the great Liam Blackwood would never stoop so low. Tell you what, I could get you a job at one of our factories. Assembly line work pays $2,500 a month - might help you afford some ramen noodles!"

Liam's voice turned icy. "Enjoy your laughter while it lasts. The game isn't over yet."

Richard snorted dismissively. "Give it up already. Survival of the fittest, and you lost. Get out of Crestwood unless you want me to make your pathetic existence even worse."

"Survival of the fittest," Liam repeated softly. "But the final winner hasn't been decided."

"Still delusional?" Richard snapped. "Face reality. You killed our mother. I was merciful enough not to press charges, but the family has disowned you. You'll get nothing from Blackwood Enterprises, and you're drowning in debt. You'll die a beggar."

Liam ended the call without another word, his expression unreadable.

On the other end, Richard smirked, convinced he'd finally broken his brother's spirit.

A sharp knock at his door interrupted Richard's moment of triumph.

"Can't you see I'm busy?" he snapped irritably.

"It's me," came the reply from the hallway.

Recognizing the voice, Richard didn't bother getting up. Instead, he directed a sneer toward the closed door.

"Victor, still lurking around like a stray dog? I paid you two hundred grand to take care of Liam. Transaction complete. Don't think sharing a last name makes us equals. I'm feeling generous today, but push me and I'll have security remove you permanently."

He leaned back with a self-satisfied smirk, waiting for the intruder to leave.

The momentary silence made Richard think he'd won.

Then came the laughter - cold, humorless, and utterly chilling. It sent an involuntary shiver down Richard's spine.

###Chapter 295

"Victor, have you lost your mind? Are you that desperate for the scraps I threw you?" Richard sneered, his patience wearing thin. "If you don't leave now, I'll have you dragged out myself."

Fury burning in his chest, Richard stormed to the door and yanked it open—only to freeze in shock.

Behind Victor stood a formidable line of bodyguards, all poised and waiting under his command.

Victor's gaze locked onto Richard's, dark and unyielding.

"Richard, you celebrated too soon."

Richard's smug confidence shattered, replaced by stunned disbelief.

A cruel smirk tugged at Victor's lips, but it vanished just as quickly, replaced by icy detachment.

"Restrain him."

Richard snapped back to reality, rage igniting in his veins. "Victor, have you lost your damn mind? I am the heir to the Winslow family, the CEO of Blackwood Enterprises! Who the hell do you think you are to lay hands on me?"

He whirled toward his own men, his voice a whip of fury. "And you—are you all blind? Get this madman out of here now!"

But his commands were met with silence. The bodyguards didn’t move, their loyalty unmistakably elsewhere.

Richard's face twisted in realization. Even the dimmest observer could see the power had shifted.

Then, Catherine stepped forward from behind Victor.

Though she had long cooperated with Victor, her heart had once belonged to Richard. But his arrogance, his recklessness, his endless betrayals had forced her to reconsider. Watching Olivia’s meteoric rise within the Kensington family had been the final straw—fear for her own future had driven her into Victor’s arms.

After witnessing the opulence of the Kensington banquet held in Olivia’s honor, Catherine had made her choice. Victor offered security, power, and ambition. Richard? Only ruin.

The moment Richard saw Catherine standing beside Victor, his shock twisted into fury. "Catherine?" His voice was a roar, venom dripping from every word. "What the hell is this? You’re betraying me? Get over here now, or I swear I’ll divorce you and cast you out like the traitor you are!"

Catherine flinched, but only for a second. Then, she lifted her chin, her eyes cold with disdain.

"You’re the blind one, Richard. Liam suspected Victor’s true identity long ago. You were just too proud to see it. Do you even know why he shares your name? Your father had secrets, Richard. The Winslow family tree has more branches than you realize."

Richard’s face burned with indignation. "That’s a damn lie! My parents were devoted to each other. I was their golden child. If not for my grandfather’s favoritism toward Liam, everything would have been mine. There’s no way my father had another son!"

...

...
###Chapter 296

Victor Blackwood's lips curled into a mocking smile. "Deny it until you're blue in the face, Richard, but science doesn't lie. The DNA results are irrefutable."

Richard Winslow staggered back as if physically struck, memories of Liam Blackwood's warnings flooding his mind.

Despite the earth-shattering revelation, Richard clung to his last shred of dignity. His words dripped with venom. "Even if you share Blackwood blood, you'll always be a gutter-born savage!"

The slap came faster than lightning. Miranda Graves moved with lethal grace, striking Richard across the face before delivering three precise kicks that sent him sprawling across the marble floor.

Looming over the fallen man, Miranda's steel-gray eyes burned with contempt. "In every measurable way, Mr. Victor Blackwood surpasses you, you insignificant worm."

Gripping his stinging cheek, Richard managed a sneer. "Who gave you the right to lay hands on me? You failed your mission to eliminate Olivia Sinclair when Victor agreed. Now that Olivia's been acknowledged by the prestigious Kensington family, you're all doomed. The Kensingtons eclipse the Blackwoods in power and influence."

At these words, Catherine Winslow's face turned ashen, her eyes flashing with bitter accusation at Miranda.

Consumed by guilt-fueled rage, Miranda struck again. "Shut your filthy mouth!" Each blow punctuated her fury.

"Enough, Miranda!" Victor's command cut through the air like a whip.

Miranda froze mid-swing, her arm trembling with restrained violence.

Victor approached Richard with the calculated grace of a panther circling wounded prey. His ice-blue eyes assessed every twitch of Richard's crumbling facade.

Richard, still defiant, spat threats about Blackwood Enterprises' loyalty and vowed retribution once he regained power.

Victor's laughter was cold as Arctic wind. "Know why I played along with your little games? To gather enough evidence to bury you." His smile turned predatory. "And thanks to your devoted wife, I now have enough to send you away for life - without even mentioning how you murdered your own mother."

Richard's bravado shattered. He whirled toward Catherine, his voice cracking with betrayal. "You told him everything? You realize if I fall, you go down with me?"

Catherine's jaw set like granite. "I'm prepared to pay that price. Victor has guaranteed my protection. I've chosen my side wisely."

Victor's laughter filled the opulent study once more. "See, Richard? Even your wife recognizes a sinking ship when she sees one."

Leaning down, Victor locked eyes with his half-brother, his voice dropping to a deadly whisper. "Here's your choice: help me secure the CEO position at Blackwood Enterprises, and I might let you keep your place in the family - as a useful public figurehead."

His next words came colder still. "Refuse, and I'll personally ensure you rot in prison. With Liam out of the picture, the Blackwood legacy will be mine regardless. The decision is yours, brother. Choose carefully."

Richard's fists clenched until his knuckles turned white. Humiliation burned through him as he gave the slightest nod of defeat.

###Chapter 297

Victor Blackwood's ruthless nature was no secret to Richard Winslow. He had witnessed firsthand how Victor systematically destroyed Liam Blackwood's defenses.

If even Liam, with all his wealth and cunning, had fallen to Victor's schemes, what chance did Richard stand?

A toxic cocktail of regret and fury churned within Richard as he realized he'd foolishly invited a viper into his life - one that now controlled his destiny.

Though Richard gave a reluctant nod, Victor remained suspicious. He knew desperate men often made unpredictable moves.

With clinical precision, Victor produced a pre-prepared contract and laid it before Richard like a death warrant.

As Richard scanned the document, despair clawed at his throat. The terms were ironclad - catastrophic financial penalties and immediate legal action awaited any betrayal.

Most devastatingly, the contract stripped Richard of all authority within Blackwood Enterprises, reducing him to a mere puppet dancing on Victor's strings. His survival now depended entirely on Victor's whims.

Every instinct screamed for Richard to resist, but reality offered no escape.

His hand shook violently as he signed the contract, each stroke of the pen sealing his humiliation.

Victor turned to Catherine Winslow, who'd managed a fragile smile until now. "Richard remains the Winslow family heir, and you his devoted wife. Life continues as normal."

Catherine's smile shattered under Victor's cold gaze. She felt Richard's venomous stare and mustered her courage. "May I leave with our daughter? I swear I won't speak of this or flee. I just...can't stay with him anymore."

Victor's refusal was immediate. "Absolutely not. What would society say if you abandoned your 'ill' husband? The contract states Richard merely requires my assistance during his...convalescence. Your departure would raise uncomfortable questions."

He continued with false sympathy, "Besides, I'm certain this experience will teach Richard to appreciate you more. You'll learn to coexist peacefully."

Catherine's eyes burned with silent fury. She knew Victor's concern was a sham - this was punishment for rejecting his advances.

For all his power, Victor remained a scarred bastard son, pitied by polite society.

Only women like Miranda Graves mistook his manipulations for affection.

Victor didn't crave love - he fed on domination and control.

###Chapter 298

Catherine was painfully aware Victor craved physical intimacy with her. This knowledge gave her the slightest leverage in their twisted dynamic. She had resisted his advances with unwavering determination, never anticipating he would retaliate with such cold-blooded cruelty.

Victor raised a hand, signaling for privacy. "Let's allow them some space to resolve matters privately."

The room gradually emptied, leaving behind a suffocating tension.

Catherine's eyes tracked each departing figure until the heavy doors clicked shut.

The moment they were alone, Richard's fury erupted violently. He grabbed Catherine by her perfectly styled hair, wrenching her head back with brutal force.

A piercing scream tore from Catherine's throat. "Richard! Have you lost your mind? I'm your wife! How dare you treat me this way? What will people say?"

Her words only fueled the inferno of Richard's rage, pushing him beyond reason.

"People's opinions?" Richard spat with venomous contempt. "I've paraded my mistress publicly while you played the devoted wife, only to betray me behind my back. Consider this your well-deserved punishment."

Catherine exploded from her seat, eyes blazing. "You think I'm blind? You and Margaret planned to discard me and our daughter the moment that woman bore you a son. I had to protect my child's future. If you can be this heartless, don't expect mercy from me!"

Richard's lips curled into a sneer. "You chose this life, Catherine. No one forced these decisions upon you. If you want out, I won't stop you. My affection for you died long ago. Since you failed to produce an heir, be grateful I still provide for you and that useless daughter of yours."

Catherine's voice broke as she pleaded, "What about Lillian? Doesn't our daughter mean anything to you?"

"She may stay," Richard said icily, "but remember - a daughter will never equal a son in my eyes. Given your treachery, I regret not casting you out years ago."

Devastation crashed over Catherine as she grasped the full extent of Richard's cruelty. Her options dwindled before her, leaving only one distasteful path - aligning with Victor, despite her revulsion. Survival demanded this bitter alliance.

Meanwhile, chaos erupted within the Kensington mansion.

Seraphina had been pulled from the pool's depths after a near-fatal drowning.

The young woman lay deathly pale on the marble floor, gasping for air as frantic family members and lingering guests crowded around.

"How could this happen to Lady Kensington?"
"I heard she's been unwell lately. This looks serious—"

"Silence!" Julian's roar cut through the murmurs like thunder. The normally composed young man stood trembling with barely contained fury. "Enough of your poisonous gossip! My sister will recover!"

The gathered crowd recoiled at Julian's uncharacteristic outburst. Never had the gentle-natured heir displayed such public emotion.

Julian's anguished gaze remained locked on Seraphina as medics worked frantically. His heart constricted with each labored breath she took. "Seraphina," he whispered hoarsely, "just hours ago you were describing your new wardrobe selections, and I promised to purchase them all. How did this happen?"

The grand hall echoed with tension as the Kensington family's carefully constructed facade began to fracture. Secrets long buried now threatened to surface, and no one would emerge unscathed.
###Chapter 299

Alistair motioned to Winston, signaling him to assist Julian.

Winston moved quickly to Julian's side, offering a firm grip as the young man swayed on his feet.

"Mr. Julian Kensington, I understand your distress," Winston said in a calming tone. "But right now, our priority must be saving her and uncovering the truth behind this incident."

"You must stay strong for Seraphina," he added softly.

Julian wiped his tear-streaked face, his expression shifting from grief to barely contained fury. "This wasn't an accident," he spat. "She was pushed. There are witnesses. The security cameras may have been down initially, but I've ordered technicians to recover any available footage. The culprit won't escape justice."

At that crucial moment, a doctor rushed forward, his face grim as he mopped his brow. "We must transport Miss Kensington to Mercy Hospital immediately. Her condition is critical - she could stop breathing at any moment."

As the group hurried to get Seraphina to the hospital, Frederick and his family mobilized to accompany her - all except Julian, who stood his ground.

Winston observed Julian's decision with concern. "Mr. Kensington, won't you join them at the hospital?"

Julian's jaw tightened. "I need to stay and discover what really happened here. Seraphina didn't just fall - someone pushed her."

Olivia watched Julian's stubborn insistence with growing unease. If he truly cared about Seraphina, why wasn't he rushing to the hospital? His singular focus on finding a perpetrator seemed odd, especially without concrete evidence of foul play.

Her thoughts kept returning to the mysterious box Liam had sent her earlier. The news of Seraphina's accident only deepened her sense of foreboding.

Winston proposed a solution. "Let's determine who wasn't present in the main hall earlier."

This suggestion immediately sparked whispers and sideways glances, with several guests eyeing Olivia suspiciously.

However, with Alistair's obvious protection, no one dared confront her directly.

A timid voice finally spoke up. "Olivia was also missing from the main hall earlier. Did she see anything?"

All attention suddenly focused on Olivia.

She remained composed, shaking her head. A nearby servant interpreted her response. "She didn't go in that direction. Several people can confirm she returned to her room to retrieve some items."

Donovan immediately stepped forward. "I can vouch for Olivia. I personally handed her something, and she remained with me before going to her room. She had no motive and saw nothing. We're chasing ghosts here - it's unlikely Seraphina was pushed at all."

"Why are we even questioning Olivia?" Julian suddenly came to her defense, his voice turning sharp. "She and Seraphina may have their differences, but they're family. Anyone spreading baseless accusations will answer to me!"
###Chapter 300

Julian Kensington's commanding voice cut through the tension, leaving the room in stunned silence.

Olivia Sinclair blinked in surprise at Julian's unexpected defense of her. This protective gesture caught her completely off guard.

A trembling maid stepped forward, her tear-streaked face turned toward Alistair Kensington. "Mr. Kensington," she whispered, "I think I saw who did it... but I'm terrified to speak."

Alistair's jaw tightened. "You have nothing to fear," he declared. "Speak the truth, and I'll ensure no harm comes to you. Seraphina is my granddaughter, and I will have justice."

His piercing gaze intensified as he added, "But mark my words - if you're lying, the consequences will be severe."

The maid bowed deeply, her shoulders shaking with quiet sobs before she straightened with newfound resolve.

After a tense pause, her nervous eyes scanned the crowd before landing on one person.

"It was her!" The maid's trembling finger pointed directly at Olivia.

Every head turned toward Olivia, whose shocked expression showed she was struggling to process the accusation.

Before Olivia could respond, Alistair's thunderous voice interrupted. "Preposterous! Olivia would never commit such an act!"

Julian's face darkened like a gathering storm. "I warned you about false accusations," he said with dangerous calm. "You'll regret this. Guards, take her to the authorities!"

The maid struggled against the restraining hands of security, crying out, "I'm not lying! I saw it clearly! That dress - it's unmistakable!"

Indeed, Olivia's gown was a one-of-a-kind creation that had turned heads all evening.

Yet the crowd remained doubtful. Who would be foolish enough to commit a crime while wearing such a distinctive outfit?

"Enough!" Julian snapped, his patience gone. "Remove her immediately."

The maid grew more desperate. "I swear it's true! Seraphina was by the lake when someone rushed up and pushed her in! I couldn't see the face, but that dress - it was exactly like hers!"

Her voice cracked as she added, "If it wasn't her, then someone must have been wearing an identical gown."

Olivia remained composed, using sign language to communicate her innocence. Her interpreter quickly translated: "I've worn this dress all evening and never removed it. I don't know if duplicates exist. I didn't push Seraphina - I wasn't even aware she was near the lake."

The sudden sound of approaching footsteps signaled the arrival of the police, called to investigate the disturbing incident.

Olivia exhaled quietly, relief washing over her at the prospect of professional intervention.

###Chapter 301

The maid was escorted away by officers for additional interrogation.

Yet Olivia's momentary relief was overshadowed by growing apprehension as the servant kept insisting she'd witnessed Olivia shoving Seraphina into the lake.

A cold dread settled in Olivia's stomach. Could someone have actually seen her - or someone dressed identically to her - at the scene? The possibility that an imposter had replicated her unique gown to frame her seemed absurd. But who within the Kensington household, besides Seraphina herself, would want to harm her? Given Seraphina's fragile health, staging such a dangerous act seemed improbable. Was this a case of mistaken identity or something far more calculated?

As Olivia grappled with these disturbing thoughts, Alistair noticed her rising distress and moved closer. "You need to rest," he murmured, his voice steady. "Your cousins and I will manage this situation. Don't trouble yourself."

Before Olivia could respond or make her exit, a security guard rushed toward Julian, breaking the tense silence. "Mr. Julian Kensington, we've successfully recovered the surveillance footage. I haven't reviewed it yet but came straight to you."

"Get it to the authorities at once," Julian commanded urgently. "Let's see what evidence it holds."

A laptop was promptly produced, and all eyes turned toward the screen.

The restored footage showed Seraphina standing near the lake's edge, engaged in conversation with Celeste.

Suddenly, a figure stormed into frame and violently pushed Seraphina into the water, exactly as the maid had described.

Celeste's immediate reaction was pure panic as she screamed for assistance.

The video evidence corroborated the servant's account, clearly showing a woman wearing a dress indistinguishable from Olivia's.

Julian, pretending to examine the details carefully, zoomed in on the footage.

The Kensington estate's high-resolution security cameras revealed every intricate detail of the dress - the fabric, the embellishments - all identical to Olivia's gown.

Watching the scene unfold, Olivia felt ice water run through her veins as she witnessed her apparent doppelgänger committing the act.

Police officers quickly located Olivia among the gathered crowd. "Miss, we need you to come with us for questioning."

With no alternative, Olivia reluctantly complied.

Julian shook his head with feigned disbelief. "This can't be Olivia. Yes, she and Seraphina have had their differences, but Olivia isn't capable of this. There must be some mistake."

An observant officer nearby overheard and interjected, "There was conflict between them?"

"Indeed," Celeste stepped forward, drawing everyone's attention.

Alistair was well aware of the ongoing tension between Seraphina and Olivia and had deliberately avoided questioning Celeste to prevent unfairly implicating Olivia.

Unexpectedly, Celeste appeared, her gaze locked on Olivia with undisguised contempt.

"I remained silent earlier, fearing the consequences of speaking out. Now, with law enforcement present, I feel compelled to tell the truth. It was Olivia. I saw her do it with my own eyes."
###Chapter 302

The accusation hung heavy in the air. "Even if you refuse to admit it, how do you explain the outfit in the video?" The woman's voice cut through the murmurs. "Everyone knows that designer dress was a personal gift from Mr. Julian Kensington. Sure, he could've commissioned a duplicate, but why would he do such a thing to his own flesh and blood?"

The crowd murmured in agreement.

"Exactly! Julian is Seraphina's brother. What possible motive would he have?"

"And didn't you see how protective Julian's been of Olivia? First the extravagant gifts, now this public defense."

"This is beyond cruel. Even with their rivalry, this crosses every line."

"You're all blind. She's jealous because Seraphina had everything while she suffered under the Blackwoods."

"That's not Seraphina's fault. Her mother chose to leave and never came back. If I were Alistair, I wouldn't welcome her either."

Alistair Kensington's coughing fit erupted violently. "Enough of this nonsense! Olivia would never do such a thing! Remove anyone spreading these vile rumors immediately! Donovan, escort them out at once!"

The elderly man swayed dangerously, his face turning an alarming shade of red.

The grand ballroom descended into pandemonium.

Olivia Sinclair felt her throat tighten at the depth of Alistair's unwavering faith in her.

Through the chaos, her gaze locked with Julian's. The smug satisfaction in his eyes sent ice through her veins.

The realization hit her like a physical blow. Seraphina was Julian's biological sister, for heaven's sake! And with Seraphina's congenital heart condition, that plunge into the fountain could have been fatal.

The pieces clicked together. Julian must have tampered with the gown meant for her. She'd always known him to be calculating, but this? Their feud had never involved him directly. What kind of monster would endanger his own sister just to frame her?

The officers approached with grim expressions. "Miss Sinclair, we'll need you to come with us. Miss Kensington remains hospitalized, and you're clearly identifiable in the security footage. We have questions."

Alistair surged forward, his frail body trembling with outrage. "How dare you! Who authorized this? That's my granddaughter!" His watery eyes darted wildly as another coughing spell wracked his frame.

The policemen exchanged uncertain glances.

Donovan Kensington recognized the signs of his uncle's deteriorating condition. "Winston," he barked at the butler, "take my uncle to his quarters immediately."

In his confused state, Alistair clutched at Olivia's sleeve. "Vivienne, please," he begged, tears streaming down his weathered face. "I was wrong. Don't leave me again. Come home where you belong."

Olivia's vision blurred as she gently pried his fingers loose. Her phone's synthesized voice filled the tense silence: "Grandfather, I'm not going anywhere. I promise I'll return. But you need to rest now, or I might just disappear like Mother did."

The threat, delivered in that emotionless digital tone, had the intended effect. Alistair allowed Winston to lead him away, though his pleading gaze never left Olivia's face until the elevator doors closed.

The officers hesitated, their hands hovering near their cuffs. Olivia straightened her spine and extended her wrists in silent surrender. The gasps around her were almost comical.

As the cold metal clasped around her wrists, Julian's smirk widened. Olivia met his gaze squarely, her own eyes burning with silent fury. This wasn't over. Not by a long shot.

The walk through the gawking crowd felt endless. Flashbulbs popped. Whispers slithered through the opulent ballroom like venomous snakes. But Olivia Sinclair held her head high. She'd survived worse. And she'd be damned if she let Julian Kensington destroy everything she'd fought so hard to rebuild.

The police cruiser's door slammed shut with finality. Through the tinted window, Olivia watched the Kensington estate shrink into the distance. Somewhere in that mansion, Alistair was probably raging against his caretakers. Donovan would be scrambling to contain the damage. And Julian? Julian would be celebrating his temporary victory.

Olivia's fingers curled into fists. Let him enjoy it while he could. Because when she got out—and she would get out—she'd make sure Julian Kensington regretted ever crossing her.
###Chapter 303

Alistair, somewhat comforted by Olivia's reassurances, reluctantly left with the others.

A uniformed officer gestured for Olivia to follow him.

Donovan immediately stepped forward. "Officer, this grainy footage proves nothing. Anyone could have dressed like Olivia. She's already stated she wasn't present. This is clearly a setup. With so many influential guests here today, arresting her would ruin her reputation."

"Mr. Kensington, I understand your concern," the officer replied evenly. "But we must follow the evidence. We can't simply take her statement without verification."

Julian interjected, "Why don't we review the security footage from the garden path to confirm her whereabouts?"

Donovan turned to Olivia, his piercing gaze searching hers. "Try to remember exactly. Where were you when Seraphina fell into the pool?"

Olivia pressed her fingers to her temples, feeling the intensity of Donovan's stare. The pieces slowly came together in her mind.

With careful gestures, Olivia explained she had been heading toward the garden entrance to meet someone, but changed her mind halfway and returned.

Donovan instantly understood who she'd intended to meet but chose not to voice it. Instead, he requested footage from the path she described.

To their dismay, they discovered that particular camera had malfunctioned.

A deep frown creased Donovan's forehead as unease settled in his gut. He suddenly realized his direct questioning might have played into the trap. Every possible alibi Olivia could provide seemed to have been anticipated, with corresponding evidence conveniently missing.

Olivia's face drained of color as she recognized the meticulous nature of the scheme.

Just then, a mocking voice cut through the crowd. "That path leads to the greenhouse. Isn't that where she went?"

"Most likely. It's rarely used."

The officers focused their attention on Olivia. "Miss Sinclair, can anyone verify you were near the garden entrance?"

Olivia shook her head grimly. She'd been alone at the time. And the person she'd intended to meet never saw her since she turned back.

The lead officer sighed and motioned toward her. "Please come with us."

As the police began escorting Olivia away, Donovan reached out and caught her wrist.

"This is my fault." Regret darkened his features. "I promised to protect you, yet here we are. Someone in the Kensington family clearly orchestrated this."

Olivia shook her head, refusing to let Donovan blame himself. The true responsibility lay with the mastermind behind this elaborate trap - and with herself for not being more cautious.

"You just need proof Olivia was at the garden entrance when it happened, correct?" A sudden voice echoed through the corridor, cutting through the tension.

###Chapter 304

The familiar deep voice made Olivia Sinclair question if stress was playing tricks on her mind. The murmurs from the surrounding crowd grew louder.

Liam Blackwood approached with Sebastian Montgomery at his side, his confident stride exuding quiet authority as he faced Donovan Kensington. "Mr. Kensington, I heard about this little gathering at your place. Hope you don't mind an unexpected guest?"

"Unexpected guests often bring the most interesting conversations. You're most welcome!" Donovan replied with an easy smile.

Julian Kensington, who had been observing from the sidelines, suddenly interjected sharply, "Donovan, have you gone mad? Liam wasn't invited. Security! Remove him immediately!"

"No invitation?" Donovan's eyebrows arched as he made a subtle gesture to an attendant.

The attendant promptly produced an engraved invitation, presenting it to Liam with both hands.

"My apologies for the late delivery, Mr. Blackwood. We weren't certain of your current residence," Donovan explained smoothly.

Liam's gaze flickered toward Julian, noting the poorly concealed disdain.

"It seems Mr. Julian Kensington objects to my presence."

Julian's lips curled in a sneer. "I wouldn't dare. It's just that your... reputation precedes you throughout Crestwood."

Liam took three deliberate steps forward, his imposing presence making the space between them feel suddenly smaller.

Julian instinctively took half a step back, his expression flickering with unease.

"Are you referring to those baseless accusations about my mother's death? Do you have proof, or are you just spreading rumors?" Liam's voice cut like steel.

Julian, caught off guard by the direct challenge, recovered with forced sarcasm. "Mr. Blackwood, are you suggesting your own family wronged you? That your expulsion from the Blackwood estate was unjust?"

Liam turned toward the police officers present. "The authorities are right here. Accusations require evidence. Ask them if they've found any proof of these alleged crimes."

The lead officer shook his head, addressing the room. "Our investigation has uncovered no concrete evidence linking Mr. Blackwood to any crime. He remains only a person of interest. Without solid proof, such claims are irresponsible."

Julian's jaw tightened but he gave a stiff nod of acknowledgment.

The officer then turned to Liam, gesturing toward Olivia. "Can you verify your whereabouts with her at the service entrance?"

"Certainly. I needed to deliver something to her. I asked Mr. Donovan Kensington to relay the message, and she met me there to receive the item," Liam stated without hesitation.

Before anyone could react, Donovan confirmed, "That's exactly what happened."

Liam continued, his voice carrying through the hall, "As for the identical dress - Olivia's outfit tonight is quite distinctive. Anyone could have copied it to frame her. And if Olivia truly wanted to harm Seraphina, why would she approach in such recognizable attire rather than changing first?"

Julian scrambled for a response. "Perhaps it was... an impulsive act of malice." His voice lacked conviction.
###Chapter 305

Olivia watched as Celeste's face remained eerily calm. The assistant didn't even attempt to warn Seraphina about the impending danger. This could only mean one thing - Celeste was either working with the attacker to target Seraphina, or she knew the assailant and had anticipated the entire incident.

The officers exchanged knowing glances, their suspicion now fully directed at Celeste.

Under their intense scrutiny, Celeste began fidgeting uncontrollably, her eyes darting around the room like a trapped animal. Olivia felt a cold satisfaction. Seraphina's so-called loyal assistant had clearly been compromised long before today.

Noticing Celeste's obvious distress, the police immediately took her into custody.

In a panic, Celeste blurted out, "It wasn't Olivia! It was another maid from the estate, dressed exactly like her. I was furious that while Miss Kensington lay dying, Olivia remained unharmed. I wanted to frame her!"

After consulting with Donovan, the authorities followed Celeste's lead to track down the real perpetrator.

They quickly apprehended the true culprit and discovered an identical dress hidden in her quarters, confirming Celeste's confession.

The maid admitted to pushing Seraphina into the lake, claiming she'd been driven to it by Seraphina's constant abuse.

Other staff members corroborated stories of Seraphina's cruel behavior.

With Seraphina now awake and refusing to press charges, the police settled for briefly detaining the attacker before closing the case.

Olivia, now completely exonerated, turned to Julian, observing the storm of emotions playing across his face.

She offered him a small, knowing smile.

Julian snapped back to reality, his voice thick with feigned remorse. "I'm sorry, Olivia. My emotions got the better of me. With Seraphina being my cousin and her health deteriorating, I let my worries cloud my judgment. That servant deceived us all. You won't hold this against me, will you?"

Olivia shook her head, her expression a perfect blend of forgiveness and warning as she signed. Nearby servants quickly translated: "Of course not. But Julian, next time you try to play games, remember - don't celebrate before the victory. Your tells are painfully obvious."

Julian's face darkened instantly.

Olivia continued signing with precise movements: "You should visit Seraphina in the hospital. Neither of us are fools. I suspect she has quite a lot to discuss with you."

Julian's jaw tightened as he bit out, "She's family. Of course I'll visit. I've been sick with worry since her accident. But thanks for the reminder." With that, he stormed away.

Olivia's gaze then shifted to Liam, who was saying his goodbyes to Donovan.

Liam pointedly avoided her eyes, maintaining an aloof demeanor as if he hadn't just fiercely defended her moments before.
###Chapter 306

The murmurs of the dispersing crowd still carried to Olivia's ears like poisonous darts.

"Honestly, if I were Liam, I'd rather disappear than show my face here. What a disgrace."

"What's his game anyway? Defending Olivia? After everything that happened between them?"

"Open your eyes. With Olivia's growing power, he's clearly trying to get back in her good graces. Pathetic, really."

"How the mighty have fallen. That arrogant prince finally got his comeuppance. I'd pay to see his face right now."

Olivia felt a strange tightness in her chest. Liam must have heard every cruel word. Yet his expression remained as unreadable as ever, those sharp aristocratic features betraying nothing. The whispers might as well have been distant thunder for all the reaction they provoked.

She knew Liam Blackwood better than these vipers ever could. His pride was legendary, unbreakable. The idea that he'd debase himself to curry favor was laughable. There had to be another reason for his intervention today, something hidden beneath that impenetrable facade.

Keeping her distance, Olivia studied him from across the room. The gulf between them now seemed wider than the ocean. She'd learned the hard way to put herself first, to build walls where bridges once stood.

When Liam finished speaking with Donovan, their eyes met across the crowded space. For one fleeting second, Olivia thought she saw something raw and vulnerable flash in those dark eyes - then it was gone, locked away behind his usual mask.

With one last unreadable glance, Liam turned and walked away. The finality of his departure struck Olivia with unexpected force, leaving behind an ache she couldn't explain. Some instinct told her this might truly be goodbye.

Alone in her suite later, Olivia finally opened the package Liam had sent. Her breath caught at the contents - a black credit card with no spending limit, the kind reserved for royalty.

But that was nothing compared to the bank statements and checks totaling ten million dollars. Beneath them lay a bundle of letters - some from Henry, her grandfather, others... from Liam himself.

The letters from Henry were old friends, cherished words she'd left behind at the Winslow estate during her hasty departure. She knew each line by heart, those comforting phrases that had sustained her through countless lonely nights.

Liam's letter was the shock. After everything, she never expected to hear from him again. Her hands trembled as she unfolded the crisp stationery, the familiar scent of his cologne faint on the paper.

"Henry always said you were too kind for your own good," the letter began. "That you needed armor to match your gentle heart. He wanted to give you these when you were ready to fight back."

"I believed you'd always stay with the Winslows, protected by family ties. I was wrong. Now I see you've grown into the woman Henry always knew you could be."

"These were always meant to be yours. I've merely been their keeper. The time has come to return what's rightfully yours."
###Chapter 307

The envelope contained a meticulously compiled list of corporations, names, and entities Olivia Sinclair had never heard of before. Astonishingly, these were assets her parents had left behind for her.

After Henry Winslow's passing and before Liam Blackwood could assert control, Margaret Winslow had swiftly seized these holdings. Over the years, Liam had clawed back some of them, though they now came burdened with legal disputes and financial complications.

Following his own expulsion from the Blackwood family, Liam had lost his grip on these enterprises once again.

In his letter, Liam expressed deep remorse for the tangled mess and, as a gesture of atonement, added several million dollars to the inheritance. He also offered his assistance should Olivia choose to actively reclaim what was rightfully hers.

As she absorbed the contents of the letter, a wave of melancholy washed over Olivia. Rumors of Liam's financial downfall had reached her, yet here he was, against all odds, returning her inheritance—and then some.

Touched by his gesture, Olivia accepted the legacy without hesitation, recognizing it as her birthright. She resolved to return the checks Liam had sent through Donovan Kensington as a sign of her newfound determination. Money wasn't her priority. Her focus was on the larger inheritance—the companies her parents had left behind.

Fueled by resolve, Olivia sought out Donovan. It was time to set things right, to reclaim what had been stolen, and to face those who had wronged her. She laid out her intentions clearly, her path unwavering.

Donovan sighed reluctantly. "I want to help, Olivia, but Liam told me he's leaving today. He's probably already boarded the plane."

The news caught her off guard. Liam was gone? The thought unsettled her. His departure felt out of character—unlike the relentless man she knew. It was a concession she hadn’t anticipated, especially now, when she expected him to fight for his place in Crestwood.

After a moment of reflection, she began to understand. Betrayal, especially from those closest to him, could break even the strongest will.

Part of her wanted to scorn his retreat, but instead, she felt an unexpected pang of regret—a softening toward him.

With a sigh, she turned to leave.

"Wait." Donovan's voice stopped her, his expression grave. "There's something we need to discuss. It's long overdue."

Olivia's pulse quickened, a mix of unease and curiosity stirring within her as she turned back to face him.

Meanwhile, at Mercy Hospital, tension hung thick in the air. Julian Kensington entered Seraphina Kensington's ward, his entourage trailing behind, arms laden with ornately wrapped gifts.

Seraphina lay conscious but fragile, her gaze fixed on the world beyond the window, her life sustained by the steady hiss of an oxygen mask. The doctors had made it clear—her condition was critical, and any complications could be fatal.

Julian approached her bedside, his voice uncharacteristically gentle. "Seraphina, don’t worry. I’ve taken care of everything. I found someone else to take the blame. You won’t have to answer for this incident anymore."

###Chapter 308

Seraphina turned slowly to face Julian, her eyes not warming with relief but hardening like glacial ice. She was no fool—this man had nearly gotten her killed.

She had only wanted Olivia Sinclair gone, not to dance with death herself. The realization that her own flesh and blood could orchestrate such treachery made her stomach churn with betrayal.

Julian, oblivious to her inner storm, kept stroking her hair with false comfort. "Don't cry, little cousin," he murmured. "Necessary sacrifices had to be made."

Seraphina squeezed her eyes shut, unable to bear his gaze. Julian's face darkened at her rejection.

He stepped closer, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "I eliminated your problem. My methods were... unorthodox, but effective. When Grandfather asks, you'll know exactly what to say, won't you?"

Without waiting for an answer, Julian strode toward the door. Seraphina's eyes flew open, tracking his exit with smoldering rage.

Yet she remained silent. Who would believe her over the golden boy of the Kensington family?

Across the estate, Olivia frowned at Donovan's words. Her hands moved in quick, skeptical gestures—still unconvinced she was truly his long-lost cousin. She signed her gratitude for his protection these past days, though her resolve to escape hadn't wavered.

Donovan leaned forward earnestly. "Olivia, I understand your hesitation. You're only here because I guaranteed your safety after what happened to your mother. But the truth deserves to be faced."

He continued gently, "The sins of our fathers shouldn't chain us. Alistair had nothing to do with that old feud. Regardless of history, shouldn't you at least meet your grandfather?"

Olivia's hands stilled.

"I don't speak without certainty," Donovan pressed. "If you doubt me, let me show you something." He moved to his bookshelf, retrieving a worn wooden box. Its polished surface bore the marks of frequent handling.

Inside lay a trove of photographs and letters. One image caught Olivia's eye—Vivienne Kensington cradling a beaming little girl who was unmistakably her younger self. No wonder Alistair and Donovan had recognized her.

Donovan's fingers traced the photo with palpable nostalgia. "After you left, the entire family mourned. Especially Grandfather. He stopped sleeping, drowned himself in whiskey, and his health deteriorated." His voice thickened. "He's an old man now. Even if he seems stable, this grief is killing him slowly."

Olivia's mind flashed to childhood memories—her mother weeping over a hidden photograph, whispering, "I miss my father too, but I can never return." Only now did she understand those tears.

Donovan suddenly produced a yellowed envelope. "Your mother sent this years ago. It's addressed to you—I never opened it." He offered it with reverent hands. "I never imagined I'd deliver it personally."

Olivia's fingers trembled as she recognized her mother's handwriting. Why had Vivienne entrusted this to Donovan?

The letter's contents shattered her composure. Vivienne had anticipated this reunion, urging Olivia to release old grudges. She wrote of regretting her impulsive departure, of longing for reconciliation. "If you're reading this, you've found your way home," the letter said. "Stay with our family. Donovan will protect you like a sister."

Tears spilled down Olivia's cheeks as she absorbed her mother's final wishes—words steeped in love and remorse. Vivienne had never owed her apologies; every line overflowed with maternal devotion.

The weight of the past and the pull of family warred within Olivia's heart as Donovan watched silently, giving her space to grieve. Outside, the Kensington estate stood bathed in golden light, its halls whispering of secrets and second chances.
###Chapter 309

Olivia Sinclair rose from her seat, her fingers trembling slightly as she formed the words in sign language. "Donovan, I need your help finding a specialist. I can't stand communicating like this anymore."

Donovan Kensington's lips curved into an unexpected smile, his usually composed features lighting up with genuine warmth. The sound of his laughter surprised even himself.

Her request touched him deeply. After all these years, Olivia was finally leaning on him - not just as a distant relative, but as true family. The realization made his chest tighten with emotion.

"I'll make arrangements immediately," he signed back, his movements precise. "But we may need to return to Westhaven. My medical connections are stronger there."

He paused, meeting her hopeful gaze. "I give you my word, Olivia. No expense will be spared. Now, would you care to join me at Mercy Hospital? Alistair would be delighted to see you."

Olivia's answering smile was like sunlight breaking through clouds.

Alistair Kensington's condition had deteriorated sharply in recent days. The once-sharp businessman now stared blankly at visitors, recoiling from unfamiliar faces. Only Olivia seemed to penetrate his confusion, her presence inexplicably calming to him.

Today, it took Olivia nearly an hour to coax him into taking his medication. As the elderly man swallowed the pills, he grasped her wrist with surprising strength. "Young lady," he whispered conspiratorially, "could you ask these strangers to leave? They're making my head ache."

Olivia glanced meaningfully at Donovan, who immediately ushered the medical staff from the room. The sudden silence seemed to relax Alistair's tense shoulders.

"I don't understand why all these people keep calling me 'sir'," Alistair confessed, rubbing his temples. "But you... there's something familiar about you." His cloudy eyes searched her face. "What did you say your name was?"

Her hands moved gracefully through the air. "Olivia Sinclair."

"Olivia," he repeated slowly, as if tasting the name. Then his expression shifted to bewilderment. "Wait - how am I understanding you? Do I know sign language?"

She nodded, explaining through gestures that they'd been close friends years ago, and he'd learned to sign specifically for her. She assured him the memories would return in time.

"Friends?" Alistair echoed, a flicker of recognition crossing his face.

Olivia hesitated. The full truth - that she was his granddaughter - might overwhelm him in his current state. During these episodes, Alistair often believed himself to be decades younger, and attempts to correct him only caused distress.

With careful movements, she retrieved a photograph from her purse. The edges were slightly worn from frequent handling. She pointed to the elegant woman in the portrait, watching Alistair's face closely for any sign of recognition.

The air between them grew heavy with unspoken questions. Olivia held her breath as Alistair's fingers trembled against the faded image. His next words would determine whether this was another moment of clarity... or another heartbreaking disappointment.
###Chapter 310

Tears welled up in Alistair's eyes as he clutched the photograph, realization washing over him. "Yes, I recognize her. This is my daughter. She was upset and ran away from home. I've been searching for her ever since," he confessed, his voice trembling with raw emotion.

His finger traced the image of the little girl in the photo. "And this precious child she's holding is my granddaughter. She has her mother's same smile, the same sparkle in her eyes."

A bittersweet expression crossed his weathered face. "I don't know where they are now. This is all my fault. I drove my daughter away with my stubbornness. She must hate me now."

Olivia felt her heart constrict with sympathy, barely holding back her own tears. Steadying herself, she reached out to comfort him. Through careful gestures, she conveyed that his daughter missed him deeply and bore no ill will. Then she signaled that she knew their current whereabouts.

Hope ignited in Alistair's weary eyes as he studied Olivia intently. "You're not deceiving an old man, are you?"

Olivia shook her head emphatically, gesturing that she genuinely knew where to find his family. She offered to lead him to them if he would trust her guidance.

To her surprise, Alistair agreed immediately. "I believe you. There's something about you that makes me want to trust you," he admitted. "You said we're friends, and true friends don't lie to each other."

A warm smile spread across Olivia's face as she regarded the elderly man who placed such faith in her.

Years of longing for Vivienne had visibly aged Alistair. Olivia wondered if her mother, if she were still alive, ever regretted leaving the Kensington family behind.

After comforting Alistair, Olivia remembered Seraphina was also hospitalized.

Learning that Seraphina's condition had improved significantly and she no longer needed ventilator support, Olivia decided to visit. As she reached the doorway of Seraphina's private ward, she witnessed an explosive outburst.

Seraphina, consumed by fury, had just slapped Celeste across the face before hurling a bowl of steaming soup at her head, her eyes burning with malice. "Why are you cowering? Didn't you swear absolute obedience to me?"

Her voice cut like a whip. "Were those just empty promises?"

Celeste, wincing from the stinging blow, dared not voice her pain. "Your happiness is my only concern," she whispered meekly. "I wish to serve you forever."

This only fueled Seraphina's rage. "Get out!" she shrieked.

As Celeste rushed from the room, she nearly collided with Olivia in the doorway. Though Celeste quickly averted her gaze, Olivia didn't miss the flash of resentment in her eyes.

It was evident Seraphina had been particularly cruel to her assistant lately. Considering Seraphina's recent brush with death at the hands of her own cousin and trusted servant, the fact that Celeste still lived might indicate some lingering restraint in the volatile woman.

Olivia studied Celeste for a brief moment before turning her attention back to the situation at hand.
###Chapter 311

Seraphina's gaze was a frozen storm of rage and contempt.

"Celeste, you imbecile!" she snapped icily. "You nearly collided with Olivia! Apologize immediately! She's someone of importance now, unlike you - a worthless nobody. Haven't you heard how my grandfather and Donovan hold her in high esteem? Offending her could ruin you."

Trembling, Celeste shook her head frantically. "I didn't mean to-"

"Then why are you still standing there?" Seraphina cut in with a mocking laugh.

Under the watchful eyes of everyone in the corridor, Celeste bowed deeply before Olivia, humiliation burning her cheeks. "My deepest apologies, Miss Sinclair. It was an accident. Please forgive me."

Celeste dropped to her knees with a heavy thud.

Olivia's eyes widened at the unexpected gesture. She quickly signaled to one of her security team, who stepped forward to help Celeste up. "Enough of this," the guard said firmly in a no-nonsense tone.

After Celeste had scurried away, Olivia entered Seraphina's hospital room. Seraphina tracked her every movement, her lips curling into a sneer that barely concealed her disdain.

"Long time no see, Olivia," Seraphina drawled. "Playing the grand lady now, are we? Did Donovan fill your head with fantasies about being a true Kensington? Don't be naive. He's just using you to manipulate my grandfather. Others might be fooled, but I see you for what you are - a fraud."

Olivia exhaled sharply in frustration. Her fingers flew across her phone screen before the text-to-speech function voiced her words.

"I used to think you had some intelligence. Now I see you're just stubborn. You can't accept that your own brother tried to kill you, and that only sheer luck saved you from drowning."

"Have you considered what would happen if Julian succeeded in framing me? If he'd sent me to prison for pushing you into the water, imagine his rage when the truth came out? You'd be the one suffering his wrath."

Seraphina froze, Olivia's words striking a chord. It was no secret her relationship with Olivia was strained, and Alistair had repeatedly warned her about this. At home, she lacked the effortless charm Julian always displayed.

Biting her lip stubbornly, Seraphina shot back, "Don't try to turn me against my own brother. He's family and only has my best interests at heart. Why should I believe you over him?"

Olivia met her gaze steadily. Her phone spoke again, "You already know the truth in your heart. I came here only to make my position clear. I never wanted this feud between us, nor do I care to hold you accountable for what you've done to me. I don't understand your hatred, but we could find a way to coexist peacefully."

Seraphina burst into harsh laughter. "Coexist? With you? Why would I ever want that?"

A coldness entered Olivia's eyes. She didn't attempt further persuasion - Seraphina had made her choice. If she insisted on hostility, there was nothing more Olivia could do.

As Olivia turned to leave, Seraphina called after her mockingly, "Leaving so soon? No more attempts to win me over? What if I told you there might be something that could change my mind?"

###Chapter 312

Olivia turned sharply, her fingers flying across her phone screen. "This isn't for me. I came because we share blood. If you don't care, why should I? Let's be clear—I'm not your punching bag. Push me again and you'll learn that the hard way."

Seraphina scoffed dramatically. "We'll see about that."

Without another word, Olivia pivoted on her heel and strode out.

As the door clicked shut, an uneasy churn settled in Seraphina's gut. How had that timid mouse transformed into this lioness overnight? It was like she'd activated some hidden power-up. "Whatever!" Seraphina spat to the empty room. "She's just manipulated my grandfather and cousin with her sob story. There's no way she's our long-lost relative."

Bitterness burned in Seraphina's gaze. As Alistair Kensington's true granddaughter, she knew Olivia was just some gold-digging imposter.

Even if provoked, what could that orphan possibly do to her? Sure, Julian had betrayed her this time, but she still had her parents' support. Olivia didn't stand a chance.

This comforting thought eased Seraphina's tension—until reality delivered its brutal wake-up call.

Not a single family member came for her hospital discharge. While she expected Donovan and Alistair's absence—they were still furious—her parents' no-show shattered her.

Celeste sensed the storm brewing. "It's all Olivia's doing," she whispered. "She convinced your grandfather to return to Westhaven for treatment. Mr. Donovan Kensington left with them, saying you needed time to... reflect. Your parents and brother rushed after them—something about monitoring Mr. Alistair's condition."

Betrayal and rage warred in Seraphina's chest. "So they've all chosen her," she choked out, tears pricking her eyes.

"Don't blame your family!" Celeste insisted. "Julian Kensington is your brother. He'd never abandon you. This is all Olivia's manipulation."

Seraphina stayed silent, her eyes dull. Ironically, Donovan—just her cousin—had visited most during her hospitalization. He still cared.

Julian? One threatening visit, some token gifts, then radio silence. Her parents barely showed either.

The painful truth whispered in her ear: since her illness worsened, her family's interest had waned. They'd spoiled the healthy child but had no patience for the sickly woman. Yet blood was blood. Surely they'd side with her against some stranger?

Seraphina squared her shoulders. "Prepare my things. We're returning to Westhaven. Donovan's parents will be back soon. His mother always adored me—she'd never support Olivia."

Three years vanished like smoke.

In the glittering heart of an international art exhibition, a striking woman glided toward the VIP section, a little girl's hand clasped in hers, flanked by a phalanx of bodyguards.

Raven locks cascaded over her shoulders, framing porcelain skin and almond eyes blazing with quiet intensity.

###Chapter 313

No one who had known Olivia Sinclair before would recognize the woman she had become.

Beside Olivia, a cherub-faced little girl with enormous curious eyes absorbed the vibrant artwork. Each stunning piece drew squeals of delight and enthusiastic clapping from the child.

Olivia's heart melted at her daughter's excitement. She lifted Isabelle into her arms. Her voice, once fragile and broken, now flowed rich and warm. "Isabelle, darling, we still need to choose Grandfather's present first. Then we'll get something special for you, alright?"

Isabelle blinked her wide eyes, her voice bubbling with childish joy. "Presents! Yay!"

"That's my clever girl." Olivia pressed a kiss to Isabelle's rosy cheek, her heart swelling with love.

Their path to the VIP lounge was suddenly blocked by a security guard.

Olivia immediately recognized the Kensington family crest on the guard's uniform.

The guard shifted uncomfortably before speaking. "Miss, I'm afraid entry isn't permitted right now. Lady Margaret Kensington and Lady Seraphina Kensington have reserved the entire space."

Olivia's smile never wavered. "I've made prior arrangements with the gallery owner. Perhaps he's occupied and hasn't seen my message. Would you mind if I waited inside?"

Her polite demeanor and confirmed appointment left the guard little choice. With a reluctant nod, he stepped aside.

As Olivia approached the VIP area, peals of laughter reached her ears. The laughter died abruptly when she entered.

Seraphina sat beside an impeccably dressed middle-aged woman who gave Olivia a frosty, assessing look.

Olivia offered a polite smile. "Good afternoon, Margaret. Hello, Seraphina."

She settled Isabelle beside her, seemingly oblivious to the tension. Seraphina let out a mocking laugh. "Really? You have to compete with me over everything, even Donovan's birthday gift now?"

Margaret sniffed disdainfully. "Seraphina and I booked this space. Must you follow us everywhere?" she demanded rudely.

Olivia blinked, maintaining her pleasant expression. "Follow you? Hardly. I'm simply here to select gifts as well. I understood all pieces were available for purchase with the owner's approval."

Seraphina burst into laughter, the sound ringing sharply through the room. "The only reason we're here is because Margaret knows the gallery owner personally. Olivia, you make it sound like befriending such people is easy."

The art world was notoriously exclusive. Even wealth and status didn't guarantee access without the right connections.

It was pure coincidence that Margaret had met this gallery's owner, securing their privileged access today to choose Donovan's gift.

Olivia didn't argue the point. Instead, she replied with calm assurance, "If I weren't meant to be here, I'm certain security would have removed me by now."
###Chapter 314

Olivia turned her full attention to Isabelle, completely ignoring Seraphina's petty behavior.

Caught off guard by Olivia's unexpected reaction, Seraphina's carefully constructed mask slipped for just a moment. Her lips formed a childish pout as she turned to Margaret with urgency. "Margaret, look at her! It's already difficult enough to select the perfect gift for Donovan, and now I'm worried Olivia might choose exactly what I wanted."

Margaret's face darkened as she approached Olivia with a stern expression. "First you take Seraphina's belongings, and now you want to steal the gift she intended for Donovan too? Ever since you returned, the relationship between Seraphina and Donovan has been deteriorating. This is clearly all your doing!"

She didn't stop there, her voice growing icier with each accusation. "What exactly is your game here, Olivia? You're an outsider, yet you insist on lingering around the Kensington family, sowing nothing but discord."

Olivia remained perfectly composed as she met Margaret's gaze. "I'm genuinely curious, Margaret. In what ways have I been this troublemaker you describe?"

Margaret answered without hesitation, her posture rigid. "The Kensington family was perfectly happy before you showed up. Seraphina has always had delicate health and was cherished by Alistair and Donovan. My husband and Frederick worked together harmoniously. But ever since you attached yourself to our family, everything's fallen apart. The evidence is undeniable."

Ignoring the accusations, Olivia gave a small smile and stepped past Margaret to address Seraphina directly. "Fascinating. So this is the story you've been feeding Margaret."

Both Donovan's and Alistair's disdain for Seraphina stemmed from her unexplained hostility toward Olivia. Beyond that, their disappointment had deepened when Seraphina chose to involve herself with Julian and others' schemes.

Despite everything, Donovan had never been cruel to Seraphina. They were, after all, cousins.

Yet Seraphina, fully aware of Frederick's ambitions to usurp Donovan's position, had willingly become a pawn in Frederick's elaborate games.

Olivia wrestled with doubts. Margaret was Donovan's mother. Was she truly oblivious to the quiet battles within the Kensington family, or had she chosen to side with Frederick out of some twisted resentment toward her?

A heavy silence settled over the room.

Margaret's frustration reached its boiling point. She was painfully aware of the fractures within the Kensington clan, particularly the strained relationship between her immediate family and Frederick's branch. She found the entire situation ridiculous and blamed Olivia entirely. Since Olivia's return, Margaret had watched helplessly as her husband and son's attention shifted to this outsider, leaving Seraphina in the shadows. In Margaret's eyes, Seraphina had been the family's darling since childhood due to her fragile health. Blind to the truth, Margaret believed everyone else was ignoring the unfair treatment Seraphina had endured at Olivia's hands.

Overcome by these thoughts, Margaret's patience finally snapped. She waved her hand dismissively at the surrounding guards. "Enough of this. Remove this woman immediately. This VIP room was reserved for Seraphina and me. What business does she even have here?"

The guards exchanged uncertain glances before reluctantly approaching Olivia, signaling for her to leave.

Throughout the unfolding drama, Isabelle's eyes sparkled with barely contained curiosity.

Olivia, however, didn't budge. Gently moving Isabelle aside, she spoke with icy authority. "This VIP room was reserved for me. It's only open today because I arrived late, and you took advantage of that."
###Chapter 315

The tension in the air was thick enough to cut with a knife.

Seraphina Kensington scoffed, her lips curling into a mocking smirk. "Are you serious? You claim to know the owner of this exhibition? Then why didn’t you mention it earlier? Pathetic attempt at bluffing."

Her skepticism was palpable, her sharp gaze locked onto Olivia Sinclair with undisguised disdain.

In truth, Seraphina and Margaret had been warned upon arrival that the private room was reserved. But Seraphina, accustomed to the privileges of the Kensington name, had brushed it off with the arrogance of someone who had never been denied anything.

In their world, few dared to oppose the Kensingtons. Even if they weren’t welcomed warmly, outright defiance was rare. Seraphina smirked, convinced she had caught Olivia in a lie.

"Olivia, if you’re so desperate to admire the pieces here, stop making up stories. I might even put in a good word for you when the owner arrives," she sneered, her voice dripping with condescension.

Margaret rolled her eyes, her impatience evident. "Don’t waste your breath. She won’t appreciate it. Just have her removed. Her presence alone is ruining my mood."

Olivia’s expression darkened, the warmth in her eyes replaced by a chilling resolve. She had tolerated their insults, willing to let their initial hostility slide.

But their relentless arrogance had crossed a line. Enough was enough.

Seraphina faltered slightly under Olivia’s icy glare. The once-submissive woman from the Kensington household had changed—especially after the birth of her daughter. Confidence radiated from her now, an aura of quiet power that unsettled Seraphina.

There was something unnervingly familiar about Olivia in that moment, though Seraphina couldn’t place it.

Without another word, Olivia pulled out her phone and dialed reception. "Send security up immediately," she commanded, her voice cold. "There are two troublemakers causing a disturbance. Escort them out. They’re upsetting me."

She hung up, turning her back on them with deliberate indifference.

Margaret’s face twisted in fury. "Who do you think you are, ordering us around? Just because you bullied people in the Kensington family doesn’t mean you can command everyone here!" she shrieked, her voice rising with every word.

She plopped onto the sofa, arms crossed defiantly, her posture radiating arrogance. "I’d like to see you try to make me leave!"

Then her gaze flicked to Isabelle, Olivia’s quiet daughter. A cruel smirk twisted her lips as she aimed her next barb. "Your daughter must be just as shameless and arrogant as you are."

The words struck like a blade.

Olivia’s eyes turned glacial, a dangerous glint flashing within them—something darker, sharper than before.

Margaret barely had time to register the change before security arrived. Without hesitation, they seized both women by the arms, preparing to drag them out.

Seraphina’s bravado shattered into panic.

"What are you doing? Do you know who we are?" she shrieked, struggling against their grip. "We’re Kensingtons! How dare you listen to her? Release us now, or you’ll regret it!"

Her protests fell on deaf ears.

The guards remained unmoved, their grip unyielding.

Olivia didn’t spare them another glance.

The door slammed shut behind them, sealing their humiliation.

Silence settled over the room.

Olivia exhaled slowly, her fingers brushing Isabelle’s hair gently.

No one insulted her daughter and walked away unscathed.

No one.
###Chapter 316

Seraphina's words struck like daggers. The guards exchanged uncertain glances, their weapons lowering slightly.

Footsteps echoed sharply across the marble floor.

A deep, commanding voice sliced through the tension. "The Kensington name means nothing to me. What exactly do you plan to do about it?"

Marcus Whitmore strode into the gallery, flanked by six imposing bodyguards in dark suits.

Olivia's lips curved into a knowing smile. "I didn't expect you to come today."

Marcus closed the distance between them with purposeful strides. His eyes sparkled with amusement. "When have I ever missed an opportunity to see you?" As the owner of this prestigious exhibition, Marcus had left Gregory Thornton's studio two years prior.

Free from family obligations, Marcus had pursued his passion for art curation. His Eldermere-inspired exhibition had become the talk of Westhaven.

Olivia had stumbled upon the exhibition during one of her walks through Crestwood. The distinctive style had immediately caught her attention, stirring long-buried memories. Now a woman who followed her instincts without hesitation, Olivia had investigated until she uncovered the truth behind the exhibition's creator.

Seeing Marcus again after three years sent a jolt through Olivia. While most memories of Crestwood had blurred with time, Liam Blackwood's face remained painfully vivid.

Lately, Olivia had been dreaming of Liam more frequently. She told herself this meant she was finally ready to move on. Meanwhile, Seraphina stood frozen, realization dawning that Olivia actually knew the gallery owner.

Seraphina's voice dripped with venom. "If you knew him, why humiliate us like this? Was this some twisted game?"

Olivia arched an elegant eyebrow. "The problem isn't my explanation, but your refusal to listen. Who exactly tried to have me removed without cause?"

Marcus turned his piercing gaze toward Margaret and Seraphina. "My assistant informed me someone took the private viewing room I reserved for Olivia. I had to see who would be so bold."

His voice turned icy. "You claim Kensington blood, yet behave like common troublemakers. The real Kensingtons would never act with such poor manners."

Seraphina paled. She exchanged a frantic look with Margaret before they hastily retreated. Neither wanted to risk a public scandal in front of Westhaven's elite crowd.

The media here were far less forgiving than in Eldermere, known for twisting even the most innocent encounters into salacious headlines.

As the two women disappeared, the atmosphere immediately lightened.

Marcus smiled warmly at Isabelle. "And who might this lovely young lady be?" Isabelle studied Marcus with curious eyes before turning to Olivia for explanation.

The unspoken question hung between them - what had brought Olivia back to Westhaven after all these years? And more importantly, was she finally ready to face the past she'd left behind in Crestwood?
###Chapter 317

Olivia tenderly stroked Isabelle's soft curls. "This is Marcus."

Little Isabelle was still mastering her words, her pronunciation unclear yet her voice carried an undeniable sweetness that melted hearts.

Marcus exhaled deeply, his expression nostalgic. "I never pictured our reunion like this. You've found your voice, become a mother, and joined the prestigious Kensington family. More than that, you've transformed completely."

Olivia's gaze turned introspective. "Change is inevitable, isn't it?"

"True," Marcus agreed, nodding. "But your transformation is remarkable. I still recall our first meeting in Gregory's studio. Back then, I thought your quiet demeanor was an act - that you were pretending to be docile when bullied. With time, I realized it wasn't pretense. You genuinely endured everything silently. Even when Evelyn and her clique tormented you, you never uttered a word of protest."

A bittersweet smile touched Olivia's lips. "I was foolishly trusting in those days."

The unspoken truth was that Liam had shaped much of her tolerance. The overwhelming gratitude she felt toward the Blackwood family for taking her in had made her endure their cruelty, especially Liam's.

Moreover, Evelyn had constantly insinuated that without Olivia's interference, she and Liam would have been together years earlier.

Evelyn had systematically blamed Olivia for ruining their supposed romance.

Young Olivia had internalized this guilt, carrying the weight of her marriage to Liam like a sin. Now, with clarity, she recognized how her kindness had been weaponized against her.

Marcus cleared his throat, changing the subject. "Speaking of which, your skills surpass mine. Why not create something for your cousin yourself?"

Olivia chuckled lightly. "It's been ages since I last crafted anything. My inspiration feels rusty. Besides, your work would resonate with him better - each piece so elegant and refined."

A faint blush colored Marcus's cheeks at the compliment. "Before I left the studio, Gregory mentioned you with regret. He said you possessed true genius and could have become a master restorer like him someday. But life rarely follows smooth paths. He wondered when he might see you again."

After a thoughtful pause, Olivia responded, "Our paths may cross again. I'll likely return to Eldermere soon. There are... matters requiring my attention." Her eyes darkened momentarily at the thought.

Marcus wisely didn't press for details.

Their conversation flowed easily until Marcus suddenly remembered something important.

"Did you hear about the Blackwood Enterprises' downfall? Ever since they disowned Liam, the company's been collapsing under Richard's chosen management. Whispers say bankruptcy looms near."

He leaned forward conspiratorially. "Stranger still, a mysterious new corporation emerged recently. Rumor claims its foreign owner has been systematically dismantling Blackwood Enterprises by snatching all their major contracts."

Marcus shook his head in disbelief. "The entire situation with Liam makes no sense. The Blackwoods had officially named him heir - he was clearly capable of running the company. Why would he betray his own mother? There are too many missing pieces to this puzzle."
###Chapter 318

Marcus Whitmore's voice carried a conspiratorial tone as he leaned closer to Olivia Sinclair. His sharp eyes darted toward her reaction before continuing. "There's something even more peculiar. The Winslow family appears to be crumbling, yet they're living like royalty."

"You might find this interesting," he added, lowering his voice. "Richard has transferred control of Blackwood Enterprises to Victor - their bastard son."

A sardonic smile played on Marcus's lips. "Rumor has it the boy showed up on their doorstep uninvited. Richard's forbidden anyone from speaking about it. And get this - the Winslows and Hartleys just hosted an engagement gala that could bankrupt a small country."

Olivia's perfectly shaped eyebrows shot up. An illegitimate son? That had to be Victor.

An engagement between the Winslows and Hartleys? That made no sense. Hadn't Liam severed ties with his family? Which meant Victor was now engaged to Evelyn. What twisted fate brought those two together?

Marcus mirrored Olivia's bewildered expression.

The Winslow fortune was dwindling, yet they threw money around like confetti. As Olivia processed this paradox, realization struck like lightning.

Liam had once confessed that her parents and Henry had left her substantial assets, systematically stolen by Margaret over the years. Those resources were undoubtedly funding Richard and Victor's extravagant lifestyle. Essentially, the Winslows were thriving on stolen inheritance - hers.

Olivia's delicate features twisted in contempt. Just because she'd been too preoccupied to deal with them didn't mean she'd forgotten. It was time they repaid every stolen penny - with substantial interest.

Turning to Marcus, her emerald eyes softened with genuine gratitude. "Thank you. I know you've been monitoring this situation for me."

Marcus waved a dismissive hand, his aristocratic features schooled into indifference. "Don't flatter yourself. I simply enjoy high society gossip."

Olivia couldn't suppress the melodic laughter that bubbled up.

Clearing his throat, Marcus added with uncharacteristic seriousness, "Truthfully, I despise what the Winslows have become. Under Liam's leadership, they were Crestwood's most respected dynasty, governed by honor. Now? They're just vulgar social climbers with more money than class."

Olivia exhaled quietly, troubled by his accurate assessment. If Henry knew how far his family had fallen, it would break his heart.

Eager to change the subject, Olivia expertly steered the conversation toward Marcus's latest art exhibition. She selected several exquisite pieces as gifts before returning to her penthouse.

She'd planned to present Donovan Kensington with his birthday gift immediately, but the usually predictable man was conspicuously absent.

Donovan, despite his flamboyant personality, had declined any birthday festivities this year.

Leadership suited Donovan perfectly. His days were consumed by boardroom battles and international deals, leaving little time for personal indulgences.
###Chapter 319

Olivia had noticed an intense focus in Liam's work ethic lately, and for reasons she couldn't quite explain, she found her thoughts drifting to him more frequently these days.

"Papa... Papa." Suddenly, little Isabelle beside her began speaking.

The toddler's words came out slightly garbled but utterly charming as she practiced her new vocabulary, and Olivia understood her perfectly.

Olivia turned to Isabelle with wide eyes. "Sweetheart, who taught you to say that?"

After a brief pause that seemed too serious for a child, Isabelle answered simply, "Mama."

Olivia couldn't suppress her smile as she gently squeezed Isabelle's rosy cheek. "You're absolutely brilliant, my love."

With Donovan absent, Olivia left the gift in his study before preparing to leave.

Olivia had business commitments that evening, and bringing Isabelle along might complicate matters.

Lately, Alistair was rarely sober. In this household, aside from Donovan and Alistair, there truly was no one else Olivia could rely on. Isabelle was her everything, her most precious bond.

Left with no choice, Olivia decided to take Isabelle along. Fortunately, the little girl was remarkably well-behaved for her age, full of bright energy but never causing trouble.

Their luxury car pulled up before an imposing neoclassical building.

Carrying Isabelle, Olivia entered through the discreet service entrance. Few knew that the entire building belonged to Olivia. It was one of the most prestigious auction houses in the city.

Over recent years, Olivia's passion for antique restoration had blossomed from casual interest to professional expertise. What began as a hobby had evolved into a trained eye capable of spotting treasures.

She'd discovered countless valuable pieces in markets across the globe, all destined for the auction block at her exclusive venue.

Initially operating in obscurity, Olivia's reputation grew as the quality of her acquisitions became known, drawing increasingly elite clientele through word of mouth alone.

Eventually, Olivia assembled a team of trained specialists to source rare finds on her behalf.

The journey hadn't been smooth. She'd suffered financial losses, faced moments of doubt, and even endured betrayal from those she trusted.

Yet Olivia persevered, initially funding her venture with a forgotten credit card Liam had given her years ago, tucked away in an old keepsake box. Despite having access to his accounts, she never touched the regular checks he sent.

Olivia understood she might never see Liam again, and if that were their fate, she was determined never to use his money.

Now her auction house stood among the most respected in the industry.

Prospective bidders required advance reservations and thorough financial vetting. Olivia had even expanded her operations internationally.

She dedicated thirty percent of all profits to charitable causes.

The once-silent girl who endured bullying had transformed into a formidable businesswoman.

Understanding the struggles of the disabled firsthand, Olivia tasked Donovan with directing a portion of their donations to an Eldermere-based charity supporting disabled children in remote, impoverished regions.
###Chapter 320

Most members of the Kensington family remained oblivious to Olivia's accomplishments.

To them, Olivia was merely a reckless spender who constantly avoided family gatherings.

Some staff members even gossiped that Olivia's new lifestyle had inflated her ego. They speculated she routinely dumped little Isabelle on Alistair or Donovan while she went out to enjoy herself.

Olivia never bothered explaining herself. She'd learned that others' opinions didn't define her reality. What truly mattered was protecting Isabelle's safety and happiness under her care.

Wearing a delicate silver mask, Olivia strode through the grand hall flanked by security. The auction venue buzzed with anticipation as guests mingled beneath crystal chandeliers.

Whispers trailed Olivia like shadows as she moved through the crowd. "That's the woman running this entire operation? She looks too young to be a mother."

"I've only seen her from afar, but that posture screams confidence."

"How does someone so young manage such an empire? There must be someone else pulling strings."

"Don't be ridiculous. She's clearly more capable than half the men in this room."

Back in her private office, Olivia settled Isabelle with a coloring book before turning to Lucas Bennett, her head steward. "You said this required my personal attention?"

Lucas bowed slightly. "Yes, Miss Sinclair. The situation involves our VIP Room No.1."

Olivia's fingers stilled on her desk. "The Kensington family reserved it? Or perhaps royalty?"

"Neither." Lucas's expression darkened. "A solo guest. That's not the concerning part." He lowered his voice. "He claims to have purchased a defective item from us last month - insists it's counterfeit. He's already deposited fifty million and provided asset verification. Only after securing the private suite did he reveal his true intentions. This is deliberate sabotage, Miss Sinclair."

This was unprecedented. Even flawed items didn't automatically indicate counterfeits. Lucas had handled hundreds of disputes, but this guest was different - he'd played the long game, gaining VIP status before striking.

Those who accessed Room No.1 represented their most valued clientele. Any mishandling could tarnish their reputation irreparably. They needed to resolve this flawlessly, leaving no room for complaint.

With no alternatives, Lucas had summoned Olivia.

Olivia tapped her fingers against the armrest, mentally reviewing potential adversaries. "Let's go assess the situation," she decided.

Lucas hesitated. "Miss Sinclair, are you certain? The guest seems... volatile."

###Chapter 321

Emerging from the shadows wasn't Olivia's typical style. Everyone at Newport knew Olivia Sinclair preferred operating behind the scenes, which made this sudden shift in strategy perplex Lucas. With a smile that held more calculation than warmth, Olivia responded, "This client's motives are transparent as glass. Delegating this matter would only invite greater complications. A direct confrontation is necessary."

Lucas nodded in reluctant agreement, turning to lead the way. As they prepared to move forward, a small but insistent tug at Olivia's leg stopped them. Looking down, Olivia found Isabelle gazing up with wide, anxious eyes.

"Stay," Isabelle pleaded, her single word heavy with unspoken fear.

Olivia knelt to meet her daughter's gaze. "Darling, Mommy needs to handle something important. Be good for Lucas, okay?"

Isabelle shook her head stubbornly, her tiny hands clutching Olivia's skirt.

Lucas attempted to distract her. "Isabelle, what if we visit the play area? They have those rocking horses you love."

But Isabelle remained unmoved, shaking her head vigorously before declaring, "Bad! Bad man!"

Olivia couldn't suppress a chuckle at her daughter's intensity. "Who's been teaching you such words? We shouldn't judge people before knowing them properly. But alright, you can come if you promise to stay right beside me."

Isabelle nodded enthusiastically, her decision final.

Lucas voiced his concern. "Miss Sinclair, I'm not certain this is wise."

Olivia lifted Isabelle into her arms with practiced ease. "She'll be fine. If she inherits even half my spirit, a little boldness won't hurt. I'll keep her safe."

With Isabelle secure in her arms, Olivia approached Suite No.1. Rather than barging in, she knocked politely.

"Enter," came a surprisingly youthful voice from within.

The tone suggested its owner couldn't be more than sixteen or seventeen.

Olivia's brow furrowed. Could their problematic client truly be this young?

Holding Isabelle closer, Olivia stepped forward, her mind racing with questions.

Upon entering, her gaze immediately found the two occupants - one clearly the teenager she'd heard, the other...

The second man lounged on the sofa with effortless elegance, his very posture radiating power and nobility. His legs were crossed casually, hands resting lightly on his abdomen. A sleek black mask concealed his features, leaving only his piercing eyes visible. Those eyes locked onto Olivia with such intensity she felt exposed, as if he could see straight through her carefully constructed defenses.

Olivia's composure wavered for just a heartbeat before she steadied herself. Setting Isabelle down gently, she addressed the room with professional poise. "Good afternoon. I'm the proprietor of this establishment. I understand there's been an issue with a previous transaction. I'd appreciate details so we might resolve this matter satisfactorily."

The masked man responded not with words, but with a subtle gesture of his fingers.

###Chapter 322

Olivia Sinclair's assistant was quick to clarify. "My employer insists your auction house must rectify this situation immediately. A simple apology won't suffice. Dealing in counterfeit artifacts is a grave violation in our profession. This could ruin your establishment's credibility."

Olivia's expression turned frosty as irritation laced her words. "Let's focus on facts. If an item from my auction proves fraudulent, I'll accept full responsibility. But first, I require proof this purchase occurred here. Sinclair Auctions doesn't traffic in forgeries."

The young man, anticipating her response, stepped forward with a polished wooden box.

Olivia opened it with measured skepticism, revealing shattered porcelain fragments. She selected one piece, examining it under the gallery lights.

Her decade-long expertise in antiquities left no doubt - this was indeed a fake.

Her attention shifted to the silver USB drive nestled among the shards. The impeccably dressed gentleman before her clearly wasn't some common scam artist. Had their rigorous authentication process truly failed?

With growing apprehension, Olivia motioned for a staff member to bring a laptop.

The video footage sprang to life upon inserting the drive.

It showed the post-auction delivery process, capturing a masked staff member carrying items to Suite No.1 where the two men waited.

The assistant, now identifiable as the recipient in the footage, exited with his employer who carefully handled the artifact until it suddenly crumbled.

The entire incident occurred within her auction house's walls, directly contradicting Olivia's earlier assurances.

Her cheeks burned with humiliation as she whispered, "This makes no sense. How could a fake get past our experts?"

Lucas Bennett paled, whispering urgently, "Miss Sinclair, even replicas don't shatter like that. We're being set up."

Olivia's instincts agreed. The delivery staff's concealed faces suggested deliberate concealment - this was no accident.

"I'll handle this," Olivia assured Lucas.

The assistant's frustration boiled over. "Madam, you sang a different tune earlier. Whether he's your employee matters little. My employer was defrauded under your roof. We demand justice."

Olivia, pulse quickening, addressed the silent figure. "How may we rectify this situation?"

The assistant scoffed. "Are you implying my employer wants your money?"

Finally, the masked man spoke, his voice like winter steel slicing through the tension. "Oliver," he commanded. "Enough. Leave us."

The room fell silent at his authority.

Olivia's breath caught. That voice... hauntingly familiar, stirring long-buried memories.

Her gaze locked onto him with new intensity as the room emptied, leaving only Olivia, Isabelle, and the enigmatic stranger.

Little Isabelle, ever curious, inched closer to the masked figure, utterly fascinated by his mysterious presence.
###Chapter 323

The masked stranger advanced, but little Isabelle darted away with youthful curiosity, her tiny feet carrying her toward more fascinating discoveries.

Left alone with the enigmatic man, Olivia Sinclair forced a nervous smile. Her voice held maternal protectiveness with an undercurrent of defiance. "My daughter's just a child, innocent to the ways of our world. Everything still holds magic for her."

Amusement danced in the man's shadowed eyes as his voice cut through the air. "Was bringing her here strategic? Did you hope her presence would temper my demands?"

Olivia stood her ground, unshaken. "You won't pin this on me today. Had you come seeking help directly, I might have refused. But now? You've got my full attention. The auction house made an error - I admit that. But unreasonable demands will meet immediate rejection."

His sudden laughter broke the tension like sunlight through storm clouds. "Clever woman," he acknowledged.

Olivia's mind replayed the security footage. The masked man and his young companion had displayed genuine shock when the artifact shattered. Their reactions were too raw, too immediate to be staged.

She remembered the muffled conversation caught on tape, the man's voice low but discernible as he instructed his companion: "With the owner absent, we'll return another day."

Olivia had analyzed those words for hours. Now, meeting his gaze, she stated, "If this is about making a statement to the auction house, my presence changes nothing. You're not here for pleasantries. You came specifically to see me."

"Perceptive," he nodded approvingly before getting to the heart of the matter. "I require your expertise, but know this - I didn't damage that artifact. I'd never risk such destruction. Your auction house thrives, perhaps too well for some competitors' comfort."

A flicker of understanding crossed Olivia's features. "I see. Thank you for the warning."

The stranger produced a folded parchment, revealing a partial schematic of intricate design.

Olivia studied the incomplete drawing, confusion knitting her brows. "What is this?"

The masked figure explained, "Olivia, I'm being transparent. I know of your apprenticeship under Gregory Thornton, your skill in restoration and creation. This should be within your capabilities."

"Certainly," Olivia accepted then immediately returned the diagram. "But sir, perhaps you should consult other experts. Many could handle this better than I. Besides, if you truly trusted my skills, you wouldn't provide only fragments of the design."

His rich laughter sent unexpected shivers down Olivia's spine. The sound was hauntingly familiar, like a forgotten melody suddenly remembered.

An inexplicable urge gripped her - to tear away that mask, to see the face beneath. Why did his presence stir such memories of her ex-husband?

Olivia shook off the absurd thought. The chances of such an encounter were impossible.

###Chapter 324

Olivia's fingers tightened around the edge of the design portfolio as the man's playful smirk dissolved into icy seriousness. "You need to decide whether you still wish to operate this auction house," he stated, his voice dropping several degrees.

Her emerald eyes hardened into slits. "Is that a threat, Mr. Blackwood?"

Liam Blackwood merely shrugged, the movement casual yet calculated. "What do you think?"

A dull ache began pulsing behind Olivia's temples. While his intimidation tactics didn't frighten her - she'd faced worse from the Kensington family - she had no desire to invite unnecessary conflict. Even with their backing, she refused to exploit their influence.

He continued smoothly, "Just accept the commission. The Kensington name holds no sway over me. That I only showed you partial designs doesn't mean I doubt your skills." His gloved finger tapped the portfolio meaningfully. "I sought you specifically because I believe only you can execute this flawlessly."

Just then, a small voice piped up, "M-mister?"

Little Isabelle had appeared silently, her tiny hands now clutching Liam's tailored trousers as she stood on tiptoes, her face scrunched in determination.

Olivia's breath hitched as she rushed forward to pull her daughter away.

But to her surprise, Liam crouched down to Isabelle's level, his voice softening noticeably. "Yes, Isabelle? What is it?"

Olivia blinked. Was that genuine warmth she detected?

The child pointed insistently at his silver half-mask. When he didn't react, her small fingers reached up to tug at its edge, clearly intent on removing it.

"Enough!" Olivia snapped, gently but firmly pulling Isabelle back. "What did Mommy say about behaving when we have guests?"

Isabelle buried her face in Olivia's skirt, her little shoulders shaking with silent sobs. Liam unexpectedly intervened, "Children are naturally curious. She meant no harm. I don't mind at all - you shouldn't scold her."

Olivia studied him carefully. "You're fond of children?"

His gaze grew distant. "I have a daughter of my own."

"How... coincidental," Olivia murmured, accepting the designs with renewed determination. "I'll do my best. But remember your promise - no interference with my auction house. It's small-scale; I can't handle complications."

"Agreed." Liam turned to leave.

At the threshold, he paused without looking back. "In seven days, my associate will deliver the first schematic. You'll receive the remaining designs then."

As his figure retreated, Olivia suddenly called out, "Liam Blackwood!"

He froze mid-step.

Her pulse skyrocketed.

When he turned, his expression was unreadable behind the mask. "I neglected to mention - I'll be returning to Eldermere soon. Rumor has it you're going back as well. Convenient timing. This way, it won't disrupt your schedule."

Olivia's stomach dropped like a stone. The momentary excitement drained from her veins.

###Chapter 325

The man gave a brisk nod before striding away without hesitation. It was as if Olivia's desperate shout of "Liam" had fallen on deaf ears.

Watching little Isabelle's radiant smile, Olivia felt a pang of conflicting emotions. Maybe she was reading too much into things.

She had hesitated before agreeing to the stranger's unusual request. Her scheduled return to Eldermere was just two days away. The coincidence of him traveling to the same destination seemed too perfect. What business could he possibly have in Eldermere?

Her phone vibrated with Donovan's caller ID flashing on screen.

"I just arrived home and found your thoughtful gift," Donovan's warm voice came through. "It's absolutely perfect. Thank you."

Olivia's lips curved into a genuine smile. "Don't mention it. Your support was instrumental in my recovery. If anything, I should be thanking you."

Donovan's tone softened further. "Is Isabelle with you? Work has consumed me lately, and Father's equally preoccupied. Neither of us has had proper time for her."

A frown creased Olivia's brow. "You must take care of yourself. When we visited today, the staff mentioned you haven't slept properly in seventy-two hours."

An embarrassed chuckle came through the line. "I specifically told them not to mention that. Yet somehow you always find out."

Little Isabelle tugged at Olivia's sleeve, bouncing with excitement to speak.

Understanding immediately, Olivia knelt and held the phone to her daughter's ear.

"Uncle Donny!" Isabelle chirped in her sweetest voice.

Donovan's heart visibly melted through the phone. "Have you missed me, little one?"

"Very much!" Isabelle nodded vigorously. "Mommy misses you too!"

Olivia's eyes sparkled with amusement as she suggested, "Shall we go home and visit Uncle Donovan now?"

Upon arriving at the Kensington estate, Olivia found the staff meticulously packing her belongings.

She had informed Donovan about her impending return to Eldermere.

Though reluctant, Donovan respected her decision. His thoughtfulness shone through the perfectly organized preparations, anticipating her potential extended stay.

Despite Olivia's insistence on traveling light, Donovan had ensured every possible necessity was packed under his supervision.

Most luggage had already been checked in under Donovan's arrangements. Olivia's only responsibility was keeping Isabelle safe by her side.

Touched by his consideration, Olivia carried Isabelle toward her room when Winston approached urgently. "Miss Sinclair, you've returned at last. I've been searching everywhere for you."

"What is it?" Olivia arched an eyebrow.

Winston cleared his throat. "Lady Margaret Kensington and Lady Gwendolyn Kensington are requesting your presence. Mr. Alistair Kensington accompanies them. They claim it's a matter of some importance."

Olivia's expression darkened instantly. The last people she wanted to deal with were Margaret and Gwendolyn - especially together. Every instinct warned her against this meeting.
###Chapter 326

Olivia offered a polite smile. "Let's postpone that for another day. I just got back and would prefer to spend time with Isabelle today."

Winston's cheeks flushed slightly, his expression tinged with embarrassment. "They insisted your presence is mandatory. Mr. Donovan Kensington has also been summoned. Apparently, this is a family matter requiring everyone's attendance."

A dull ache pulsed behind Olivia's temples at his words. The phrasing left her no room for refusal. "Tell them I'll change my clothes," she conceded through gritted teeth.

After switching into more formal attire, Olivia entered the grand living room.

Just as she'd anticipated, the space overflowed with Kensington family members. Alistair occupied the central armchair, his clouded gaze flickering with confusion. His mental state had declined sharply in recent years, making recognition of faces nearly impossible.

Though Alistair typically ignored everyone's presence, he always brightened at the sight of Olivia.

"Grandfather." Olivia's face lit up as she approached him. "Did you take your medicine like the doctor instructed?"

Alistair nodded absently, patting her hand. "Sweet girl, you seem familiar. Who might you be?"

"I'm Olivia, your granddaughter," she replied, swallowing the familiar lump in her throat. She'd repeated this exchange countless times, yet remained prepared to do so indefinitely.

Without warning, sharp nails dug into Olivia's forearm, yanking her backward.

She turned to face Gwendolyn.

"Enough with the saintly act," Gwendolyn hissed, her expression dark. "You've been here long enough. Have you even acknowledged the other elders? Or is dear Alistair the only one worthy of your attention?"

Margaret scoffed from her nearby seat. "She clearly thinks herself above greeting the rest of us. Winning over Alistair is her only objective—with his favor, she needs no one else."

Olivia's gaze swept across the crowded room. Frederick's branch of the family had turned out in full force. Margaret sat positioned strategically near Alistair, while Julian's smug face made Olivia's skin crawl. She felt little warmth toward most present.

A sardonic smile curved Olivia's lips as she addressed Gwendolyn. "I show respect where it's earned. Grandfather behaves as an elder should. You, on the other hand, greet me with nothing but barbs and backhanded compliments. Don't mistake my restraint for weakness."

Gwendolyn's face mottled with rage. After a tense silence, she sneered, "Your voice may have healed, but instead of showing gratitude to the Kensingtons or proper respect to your elders, you dare criticize me. You're disgusting, Olivia."

Ignoring the outburst, Olivia turned back to take her seat beside Alistair.

Margaret shot Olivia a glacial look before exchanging a subtle nod with Gwendolyn. The silent communication served its purpose—Gwendolyn's anger visibly cooled as she remembered their agenda.

With startling abruptness, Gwendolyn's sneer transformed into a saccharine smile.
###Chapter 327

Clearing her throat, Gwendolyn spoke with deliberate slowness, a cunning smile playing on her lips. "I've gathered everyone here today to share some promising news. As we all know, Seraphina has been in delicate health for years. We've assembled the world's leading specialists who will perform a life-changing procedure on her soon."

She paused dramatically, letting the weight of her words sink in. "The surgery carries significant risks. If successful, it could transform Seraphina's quality of life. But if it fails..."

Gwendolyn's voice cracked, tears welling in her eyes as she struggled to continue.

Seraphina stepped forward, placing a comforting hand on her mother's arm. "Mother, please don't upset yourself. This is our best chance. I'll be fine - I promise."

Olivia's brow furrowed. Had they really summoned her all the way here just for this announcement? The Kensingtons couldn't possibly be ignorant of her strained relationship with Seraphina. There had to be another motive behind this gathering.

As if reading her thoughts, Gwendolyn continued, "We need everyone present at the hospital during Seraphina's operation. Your presence will give her strength. The doctors emphasized how critical the recovery period is - it could determine the entire outcome. Hearing familiar voices might make all the difference."

Seraphina broke into theatrical sobs, covering her face with her hands. "I'm such a burden to this family with my constant health problems!"

Olivia suddenly felt the weight of hostile gazes upon her. Looking up, she met Margaret's saccharine smile.

"Olivia," Margaret said with false sweetness, "I know you and Seraphina have your differences, but she's suffering. Can't you set aside your petty grievances for once?"

Olivia returned the smile with equal insincerity. "I'd be happy to help, though I doubt my presence would bring Seraphina any comfort. We both know how much she despises me. My staying at the hospital would only agitate her." She held up a hand before Margaret could interrupt. "But please don't mistake my reluctance for indifference. I'll visit regularly."

She took a deliberate breath before delivering the crucial point. "However, I have prior commitments in Eldermere the day after tomorrow - arrangements made months ago. Unless Seraphina specifically requests my presence, I'll maintain contact remotely after my return."

Seraphina wiped her tears away with a dramatic flourish. "See, Margaret? I told you Olivia wouldn't care. She's probably hoping something goes wrong during my surgery!"

Frederick slammed his fist on the table, glaring at Olivia. "You may act however you please at home because of Alistair's favoritism, but Seraphina is your cousin! How can you be so cold-hearted as to abandon her in her time of need?"

Olivia arched an eyebrow. "Aren't you all going to be there? Why does my presence matter so much?"

Margaret's voice dripped with contempt. "Is that really your attitude? It's sickening how you take everything the Kensingtons offer while giving nothing back. You won't be boarding any plane the day after tomorrow. You will stay for Seraphina's surgery. We're family, and it's time you started acting like it. Refuse, and I'll have no choice but to inform the elders about your shocking lack of compassion!"

When Olivia remained unmoved, Margaret escalated her tactics. With a cruel smirk, she added, "Or do you want your daughter Isabelle to grow up known as heartless as her mother? Don't come crying to me when she resents you for this someday."

Olivia felt the walls closing in, her stomach churning with frustration. The Kensingtons were determined to keep her trapped here. Even if she managed to escape, they'd likely drag her back by force. What exactly were they planning?
###Chapter 328

Julian Kensington, the sly fox, strutted toward Alistair with a predatory grin. "Ladies, let's not be too cruel to Olivia," he drawled. "Olivia can go. I'll take care of dear grandfather myself."

His fingers curled possessively around Alistair's frail wrist, the smile never reaching his cold eyes. "No need to worry. I'll be here to tend to Alistair while Olivia and Donovan are gone."

Olivia's emerald eyes turned glacial. "He's your grandfather, Julian," she spat through clenched teeth.

Julian batted his lashes with practiced innocence. "Whatever do you mean?" he asked, voice dripping with false sweetness. "I'm merely being the devoted grandson."

The air thickened with unspoken threats. Everyone present knew this was nothing short of a hostage situation.

The Kensington clan sat like statues. Even Margaret remained uncharacteristically silent.

Though Frederick and Margaret's husband shared a bitter past, Margaret had always been close to Frederick's branch. A bitter laugh threatened to escape Olivia's throat. Could Donovan truly have been raised by this viper? The contrast between mother and son was staggering.

Olivia's shoulders sagged in surrender. "Fine," she conceded with a weary sigh. "I'll cancel the arrangements."

Gwendolyn plastered on a saccharine smile and patted Olivia's arm. "There's a good girl. This is what's best for the family. Perhaps you and Seraphina can finally make peace. You are cousins, after all."

Olivia forced her lips upward. "I'd be perfectly content if you and Seraphina would simply vanish from my life. But since that won't happen, spare me the pretense of concern."

With that, she turned Alistair's wheelchair toward the exit.

Gwendolyn's mask slipped the moment Olivia's back was turned. "The audacity!" she hissed under her breath. "Who does she think she is? That senile old fool is blind to her manipulations!"

Seraphina approached her mother, hesitation coloring her voice. "Mother... is it true Olivia inherits a third of grandfather's estate?"

"Yes," Gwendolyn whispered sharply. "When Alistair was still lucid, he gave the will to Donovan. Margaret saw it—otherwise we'd never have known."

The very notion of Olivia claiming any portion of the Kensington fortune made Gwendolyn's blood boil. In her eyes, Olivia was merely the daughter of Alistair's deceased child—entitled to nothing. The revelation that Alistair intended to bequeath her such a substantial share had sent shockwaves through the family.

Alistair had originally planned to divide his wealth equally among his three children.

Frederick argued Olivia deserved nothing since her mother was gone.

Yet Alistair remained adamant about including her. Naturally, this didn't sit well with Gwendolyn and the others.

Initially, Margaret had no interest in the family squabbles. But the moment she laid eyes on that will, she swiftly allied herself with Frederick's faction, supporting their schemes without hesitation.

The day of Seraphina's procedure arrived sooner than expected.

Having anticipated Seraphina's delicate condition and the extremes to which Frederick's family would go, Olivia decided to take precautions this time.

###Chapter 329

Olivia arrived at Mercy Hospital but refused to step anywhere near Seraphina's ward. No matter who tried to corner her, she had the perfect excuse ready.

Whenever questioned, Olivia would fake a cough behind her mask. "I'm still recovering from the virus. I'll visit when Seraphina's fully healed. Don't worry—I'm practically living here already, eating hospital food and everything. Consider this my way of keeping her company."

"Olivia, what's your problem?" Margaret snapped. "If you didn't want to be here, why did you even come?"

Olivia blinked innocently. "Margaret, don't you remember? You practically dragged me here."

The realization struck Margaret like a slap. They were the ones who had insisted Olivia stay.

Now, Olivia was planted in this spot, leaving Margaret clueless about how to proceed with her carefully laid plans.

Margaret's expression darkened. "Forget this," she muttered before storming off.

Isabelle peeked out from behind Olivia, her wide eyes filled with unease. "Mommy, she was scary!"

Olivia smoothed Isabelle's hair, soothing her. "Stay close to me, sweetheart. Don't go anywhere, no matter who asks, okay?" Isabelle nodded eagerly. "Mommy, I'll be good."

Olivia smiled and cupped her daughter's cheek. "That's my girl," she whispered.

After some discreet inquiries, Olivia learned that neither Donovan nor his father could make it. They were apparently swamped with issues at the Kensington estate and couldn't leave. If that was true, it made sense.

But something still didn't sit right with Olivia.

At lunch, Olivia did a quick calculation. In two days, Seraphina would be fully recovered, and she could finally take Isabelle away.

Isabelle had been born in Westhaven. Though she was Eldermerean by blood, she had never actually set foot in her homeland.

Despite her young age, Isabelle was fluent in both Westhavenian and Eldermerean.

Still, there were cultural differences between the two countries.

Concerned that Isabelle might struggle to adjust, Olivia found some popular Eldermerean children's shows for her to watch. Olivia was nearly asleep before Isabelle finished the first episode.

Glancing at the locked door, Olivia beckoned Isabelle over. Isabelle set the tablet aside and hurried to her mother's side.

"Sweetheart, want to take a nap with me?" Olivia asked, pulling her daughter close. In that moment, holding Isabelle, she felt like she held the entire world in her arms.

Rubbing her eyes, Isabelle nodded sleepily. "Okay, Mommy. I'm tired too."

The room fell silent as rain began tapping gently against the windows.

Half-asleep, Olivia felt someone carefully drape a blanket over her.

Bleary-eyed, she looked up and saw the masked man from the auction house that night.

His gaze held a quiet warmth.

###Chapter 330

The rain tapped softly against the windowpane as Olivia Sinclair jolted awake, her heart pounding violently against her ribs. The remnants of her nightmare clung to her like a second skin.

"What are you doing here?" Olivia had demanded in her dream, shock evident in her voice. This was the Kensington family's private medical facility. How had he managed to infiltrate the heavily guarded hospital undetected?

The silent figure had slowly removed his mask, revealing the chiseled features of Liam Blackwood.

Before Olivia could react, little Isabelle in her arms began squirming excitedly. "Daddy!" the child squealed, reaching tiny hands toward Liam. The sight of her daughter willingly going to him had frozen Olivia's blood.

She'd tried to scream, to move, but her limbs had turned to lead. Helpless, she could only watch as Liam walked away with their daughter, Isabelle casting occasional confused glances backward until Liam firmly guided her forward.

"No!" Olivia gasped, sitting bolt upright in bed.

The hospital room was quiet except for the steady hum of medical equipment. Moonlight filtered through the half-drawn curtains, casting elongated shadows across the empty space beside her.

Olivia's hand flew to the cold sheets where Isabelle should have been sleeping. The movement should have woken her light-sleeping daughter. Unless...

Panic surged through her veins like wildfire. "Isabelle?" Her voice cracked as she called out into the darkness.

Silence.

Throwing back the covers, Olivia's bare feet hit the cold floor. The VIP suite, designed like a luxury apartment, suddenly felt cavernous and threatening as she searched room after empty room.

The main door was slightly ajar. Olivia's breath caught. Someone had taken her daughter. The parallels to her nightmare were too precise to ignore. Could Liam truly have...? No, that was impossible.

"Isabelle!" Olivia's scream echoed through the sterile hallway as she burst from the suite. Nurses and orderlies turned to stare at the wild-eyed woman in hospital garb running barefoot down the corridor.

Her frantic inquiries yielded nothing. She'd demand the surveillance footage from the director immediately. But before she could reach the elevators, crisp footsteps approached from behind.

"Don't just stand there. Restrain her." The familiar voice dripped with icy command.

Strong hands seized Olivia's arms, forcing them behind her back. She struggled against the grip, but the security personnel held firm as they marched her toward Margaret Kensington.

The older woman stood with arms crossed, her expression glacial. "Olivia, drop the theatrics. Seraphina's transplant failed. Are you satisfied now?"

Olivia barely registered the words. "You think I care about your petty games right now? Isabelle is missing! Let me go this instant!"

Margaret's lips curled into something between a smirk and a snarl. "Missing? How convenient. First you sabotage the procedure, now this performance?"

Olivia's vision swam with rage and terror. Every second they wasted was another second her daughter spent in danger. She had to find Isabelle. Now.
###Chapter 331

The silence stretched for only a heartbeat before Olivia Sinclair regained her composure. "This desperate attempt to frame me is laughable. I've never even met that woman. How could her situation possibly involve me? I need to find Isabelle immediately. Release me now! Or I'll call the authorities to investigate who truly harmed Seraphina."

Margaret Kensington let out a derisive snort before barking orders. "Search her belongings."

Olivia stood helpless as they rummaged through her purse with rough hands.

Finally, Margaret snatched Olivia's phone triumphantly.

With deliberate cruelty, Margaret tossed the device into a nearby waste bin. "Still refusing to admit your guilt? Very well. Take her back to the estate and lock her up. We'll consider releasing her when she decides to confess."

Panic surged through Olivia's veins. "Name your price! I'll do anything - I'll even leave the Kensington family forever. But right now, my daughter is missing. Margaret, you're a mother too. Surely you understand this agony?"

For a fleeting moment, Margaret's expression wavered. Then her features hardened like marble. "Don't concern yourself with Isabelle. We'll ensure her... comfort. You should focus on reflecting on your crimes. The sooner you confess, the sooner you'll see daylight again."

Despite her frantic struggles, Olivia was dragged away like common trash. The Kensington estate loomed before her, its gilded gates swallowing her whole as she was shoved into a musty chamber.

The heavy door slammed with finality, plunging the room into oppressive darkness. Curled into herself on the cold floor, Olivia's mind raced not with fear for herself, but with terror for her missing child.

Then realization struck like lightning. Margaret's words echoed in Olivia's mind, revealing their sinister pattern. The entire Kensington family weren't fools - Donovan and his father would return eventually. They'd uncover this farce and free her. So why this charade?

Margaret's assurance about Isabelle's safety suddenly took on ominous meaning. Olivia scrambled to her feet, pounding on the solid oak door until her fists ached. "This is illegal imprisonment! Do you really think Donovan won't discover your schemes? Open this door! If you've harmed a single hair on Isabelle's head, I'll make sure you regret it for eternity!"

Her throat burned from screaming, but only silence answered.

Frantic, Olivia turned her attention to the room's high window. She could stack furniture to reach it, but the drop outside promised broken bones. The risk meant nothing compared to her daughter's safety.

With grim determination, Olivia bit her lip and began her precarious climb.

Her first attempt ended in a painful crash to the floor.

The second sent her sprawling across dusty hardwood.

By the third failed attempt, her once-pristine clothes were torn, her hair matted with sweat and grime.

###Chapter 332

The sharp pain shot through Olivia's arm as she scraped against the jagged edge during her desperate climb. Crimson droplets trailed down her pale skin, each throb reminding her of the urgency.

Her teeth sank into her lower lip hard enough to draw blood. The metallic taste grounded her as she forced herself upward, hand over trembling hand.

The window ledge finally came within reach. Olivia hauled herself onto the narrow perch, her breath coming in ragged gasps.

No balcony. No fire escape.

Just a sheer three-story drop onto unforgiving concrete below.

Vertigo gripped Olivia as she peered down. Her stomach lurched violently. But then Isabelle's laughter echoed in her memory - that sweet, bell-like sound that had kept her going through every hardship.

Isabelle had been her miracle child. The doctors had called her survival against all odds a medical marvel after the traumatic birth that left Olivia unable to conceive again.

That made every moment with Isabelle infinitely precious.

Olivia had made countless mistakes in her life. She'd been naive, trusting, weak. But she'd sworn her daughter would never suffer as she had.

This vow had driven Olivia to build her business from nothing, to claw her way up from poverty's grip. Yet now, despite everything, danger had still found Isabelle.

The coppery taste of blood filled Olivia's mouth as she bit down harder. The pain cleared the fog of fear. She should have anticipated this. Should have taken more precautions.

No time for regrets now.

The window ledge creaked ominously under her weight. Olivia squeezed her eyes shut, whispered a prayer, and pushed off.

The world spun violently as she plummeted. Then - impact. The grassy slope absorbed some of the fall, but white-hot pain still exploded through her right ankle.

Cold sweat drenched Olivia's body as she fought to remain conscious. Every nerve screamed in protest as she forced herself upright.

Footsteps.

Olivia barely had time to drag herself behind a towering hedge before two uniformed staff members rounded the corner.

"...important guest arriving tonight," one murmured. "The master's pulling out all the stops."

Olivia pressed a hand to her mouth, stifling her ragged breathing. She was deep in Frederick Kensington's territory now. One wrong move could be fatal.

The servants' voices faded as they continued down the path, oblivious to the bleeding woman hiding mere feet away.

Olivia counted to thirty before daring to move. Every step sent fresh agony through her injured leg, but she couldn't stop now.

Not when Isabelle's life hung in the balance.
###Chapter 333

The crisp morning air carried whispers through the Kensington estate's manicured gardens.

"Esteemed guest? People don't visit the Kensingtons unless they want something." A guard scoffed under his breath. "Who could possibly outrank the Kensingtons themselves?"

His companion leaned closer, voice dropping to a hushed tone. "This one does. Rumor has it he controls both daylight and shadow empires. That massive black market in Valtierra? His playground. Enterprises spanning continents answer to him. His true identity? A ghost story even among the elite. Only emerged from the shadows recently. They call him Mr. Black."

The head guard straightened his tie. "Then we treat him like royalty. Double the patrols. No disturbances reach his ears. Understood?"

Hidden behind a marble fountain, Olivia Sinclair pressed a hand to her throbbing leg. Her escape attempt had nearly succeeded. Almost.

The guards' footsteps faded down the cobblestone path.

Olivia emerged, wincing as weight settled on her injured limb. Each step sent white-hot pain shooting through her nerves. The estate gate shimmered in the distance - so close yet impossibly far.

A shout shattered the morning calm.

"Intruder at the east perimeter!"

"It's Olivia Sinclair! Don't let her reach the gate!"

Olivia's vision swam. Her body moved through molasses while her pursuers closed in like wolves. They formed a tightening circle around her.

The guards parted as Celeste Dumont approached. The assistant's cold gaze raked over Olivia's bleeding leg. "Window jump? How dramatic." Her lips curled. "Though you've saved us the trouble. The order was clear - attempted escape means broken legs."

Olivia's jaw clenched. "Frame me all you want. But Isabelle? She's innocent. When Donovan and Reginald Kensington return-"

Celeste's laughter cut through like shattered glass. "They'll applaud our actions. After your daughter tampered with Miss Kensington's medical equipment during recovery? She's vegetative now. This mess is yours to clean up." She leaned closer. "Margaret Kensington has your child. Cooperate, or Isabelle suffers."

Olivia's world narrowed to tunnel vision. "Take me instead! She's just a child, for God's sake!"

"Take you?" Celeste arched a perfectly sculpted brow. "You were always the problem. Your daughter will pay first. Your turn comes later."

Images flashed behind Olivia's eyes - Isabelle's frightened face, small hands reaching for her mother. How had it come to this? She'd never wanted their wealth, their power. Just to live quietly. And now they'd drag an innocent child into their twisted games?

"Give her back!" Olivia's voice tore from her throat as she lunged forward.
###Chapter 334

Olivia didn't flinch. With a subtle flick of her wrist, she signaled to a nearby guard.

The burly man responded instantly, swinging his leg back with brutal force. His steel-toed boot connected with Olivia's spine, sending her sprawling face-first onto the cold marble floor.

Pain exploded through Olivia's body as her injured leg twisted beneath her. Yet the physical agony paled in comparison to the crushing weight of regret pressing against her chest.

If only she'd been more vigilant. If only she'd noticed the warning signs earlier and alerted her allies. Her arrogance had blinded her to the viper's nest she'd walked into.

Celeste loomed over Olivia's crumpled form, lips curled in triumph. "Olivia Sinclair," she sneered, "do you have any idea how much I despise you? Ever since you arrived, Miss Kensington's temper has been unbearable. All her frustrations get taken out on me." She crouched down, grabbing Olivia's chin with bruising force. "You were nothing but a charity case. How dare you claim the Kensington name? You belong in the gutter where we found you."

The cruel laughter echoed through the grand hallway, making Olivia squeeze her eyes shut against the humiliation.

Suddenly, rapid footsteps approached.

Olivia braced herself, expecting Seraphina or Gwendolyn to appear with more tormentors. Her last shred of hope flickered out.

Then an unexpected voice cut through the tension.

"Interesting entertainment you've arranged here. Private executions now?"

Olivia's head snapped up, her vision swimming as she struggled to focus.

The masked figure stood framed in the arched doorway, his young assistant Oliver at his side.

Celeste scrambled forward, blocking their path with forced cheer. "Just dealing with a petty thief, Mr. Blackwood," she lied, her voice unnaturally high. "My apologies for the unpleasant sight. Please allow me to escort you to the main hall. Mr. Kensington should be returning shortly."

Oliver, despite his youth, carried himself with the same arrogant bearing as his employer. His sharp features twisted in disdain. "And who exactly are you to dictate where we go?"

Celeste's smile wavered but held. Julian Kensington had been explicit - these VIP guests must be treated with utmost respect. They couldn't afford another misstep against Donovan.

With visible reluctance, Celeste stepped aside.

Oliver leaned toward the masked man, whispering loud enough for all to hear. "Sir, since when do we involve ourselves in domestic disputes? Especially over some common thief?"

The masked man's voice emerged icy and clipped. "Enough."

Oliver fell silent immediately. As he moved closer, his eyes widened in recognition. "Wait - isn't this Olivia Sinclair? The Kensington heiress? Since when do aristocrats get accused of theft?"

Celeste's face drained of color. How did Olivia know these people? This complication hadn't been part of the plan.

Olivia herself stared in shock. Of all possible rescuers, she never expected these two.

###Chapter 335

Celeste Dumont pointed at Olivia Sinclair and stepped forward with a smirk. "She's no thief. We only called her that because of some... complicated family matters. She had a falling out with Miss Seraphina Kensington. Things escalated to the point where she instructed her daughter to tamper with Miss Seraphina's medical equipment. That's why her condition hasn't improved."

"Is that so?" The masked man's voice dripped with sarcasm. "Then why do I remember a gala years ago where someone pushed Seraphina into the pool and framed Olivia? The truth eventually came out - Olivia was innocent. Ring any bells?"

Celeste's face paled visibly. "You—you were there that night?" Her voice cracked with disbelief.

The masked man's lips curled into a knowing smile. "There are no secrets from me. If you don't want your dirty laundry aired, don't hang it out in public. We all know who really tried to harm Seraphina then, just as we know now."

Celeste's hands trembled as she desperately tried to redirect blame. "Sir, you must be mistaken! How could that be? It was this scheming woman who wanted to hurt Miss Seraphina! The rest of the Kensington family had nothing to do with it!"

Oliver Hart let out a derisive laugh. "Interesting how defensive you're being. He never mentioned the Kensingtons being involved. Why so quick to protest?"

Celeste's mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water, panic written across her features.

The masked man knelt beside Olivia, gently gathering her battered form into his arms. As he looked down at her injuries, pain flashed in his eyes behind the mask. Olivia, barely conscious, instinctively relaxed into his hold, overwhelmed by a strange sense of familiarity.

As darkness threatened to claim her, she heard his low, measured words. "I thought Donovan was capable of protecting you. Clearly, I overestimated him."

The pain and confusion clouded Olivia's normally sharp mind. What did he mean by entrusting her to Donovan? Who was this mysterious man?

When Olivia next opened her eyes, Donovan Kensington sat vigil at her bedside.

Time had passed while she was unconscious. Her legs were now encased in plaster, and every slight movement sent waves of agony through her body.

Her first thought was for Isabelle. "Where's Isabelle?"

Donovan's initial relief at seeing her awake vanished, replaced by a shadow crossing his features. "Isabelle's in the next room. She's stable—out of danger."

Olivia threw off the blankets, determined to rise. "I need to see her. What did they do to my daughter?" Fear and maternal instinct drove her to move despite the pain.

Donovan immediately restrained her. "The doctors said any movement could cause permanent damage. Is that what you want?"

Olivia pushed him away, her voice breaking with emotion.

"Now I understand why my mother took me from the Kensingtons all those years ago. Since they never wanted us back, why force me to stay? I don't care about the Kensington fortune."

She took a shuddering breath. "True, my business isn't as grand as the Kensington empire, but it provides more than enough for Isabelle and me."

Her eyes burned with determination. "Once I recover, we're leaving and never coming back. Whatever schemes you, Alistair, and Reginald are plotting—count me out. They're right. I'm an outsider with no claim to the Kensington wealth."
###Chapter 336

"Olivia!" Donovan's voice boomed with uncharacteristic fury. Never in all their years together had he spoken to her with such sharpness.

The man who had always treated her with infinite patience now regarded her with unmistakable disappointment darkening his gaze.

"I understand your concern for Isabelle, but you must realize there were factors beyond Alistair's and my control. Everyone's on edge after what happened."

Though clearly not himself, Alistair had remained at Isabelle's bedside throughout the night. "This entire situation began with my mother. My father never anticipated her actions. Step outside if you doubt me—he's been kneeling in the corridor since midnight."

"What?" Olivia's breath caught. Slowly, her composure returned.

The Kensingtons were known for their unshakable pride. The image of Reginald Kensington spending hours on his knees shocked her to the core. This was clearly his attempt to atone for his wife's misdeeds. Emotions warred across Olivia's face, prompting Donovan to soften his tone.

"I spoke too harshly. I know what you've endured, but we've investigated thoroughly. Those responsible will answer for this. No one ever explained why your mother left, but I'm ready to tell you everything now."

As Donovan unraveled the events of that fateful year, Olivia's understanding deepened.

The Kensingtons had once been the picture of familial harmony. Though Frederick's branch of the family harbored ambitions, they'd never dared make trouble while Alistair lived. Harming Vivienne had never been their intention.

Everything changed with Donovan's birth.

For reasons no one understood, Margaret grew suspicious.

Buried in work, Reginald had little time for his wife during that period.

Convinced of his infidelity, Margaret spiraled into despair. With no alternative, Reginald asked his sister to comfort her. Vivienne agreed without hesitation.

Under Vivienne's gentle care, Margaret's spirits lifted.

Then came the business dinner where Margaret witnessed an unknown woman embracing her husband.

A simple misunderstanding.

Yet in that moment, Margaret shattered. She became convinced Vivienne had been planted to spy on her.

Resentment festered. Margaret envied Vivienne's carefree existence and the unconditional love she received from their family.

Then came the crisis that changed everything—Donovan's disappearance.

The catalyst? Vivienne.

That day, Donovan had begged his aunt to take him out.

Vivienne brought an entourage and made meticulous preparations. Yet in one unguarded moment, he vanished.
###Chapter 337

The tension between Vivienne and Reginald escalated after this incident, while Frederick's family only fueled the flames of discord. Not a single soul stood by Vivienne's side.

In the heat of their confrontation, Alistair delivered a stinging slap across Vivienne's face.

Heart shattered, Vivienne left the Kensington estate with Olivia in tow, swearing she'd never set foot there again.

The public narrative painted Vivienne as the rebellious daughter who defied her family's wishes by running off with a country bumpkin, enraging Alistair. But reality told a far different story.

Regret consumed Alistair soon enough. He spent over a decade searching for his lost daughter and granddaughter, only recently managing to reconnect with them.

Upon hearing this, Olivia immediately voiced her suspicion. "That can't be right. My mother is meticulous. She wouldn't let such a thing happen. There must be a traitor among us."

"You're absolutely right," Donovan replied with a bitter twist of his lips. "We've just uncovered the mole. It turns out to be my own mother."

Olivia's eyes widened in shock as she stared at Donovan, her mind reeling from this revelation.

Donovan's eyes darkened with pain, his voice trembling slightly as he spoke.

"As much as it pains me to admit, the evidence is undeniable. We only discovered the truth recently. Before that, I still believed Vivienne was responsible for my disappearance. Yet I never held it against her."

"Even during those five difficult years before I was found, I was certain of her innocence. I suspected betrayal within my family, but never imagined it would come from my own mother."

"How is that possible..." Olivia's voice faded into stunned silence. Though she'd never warmed to Margaret, the idea of her orchestrating such cruelty seemed unfathomable. Donovan, her own son, had suffered wounds too deep to ignore.

During his clearer moments, Alistair had shared grim details of the past. When Donovan's whereabouts were finally uncovered, his captors had planned to maim him permanently - ensuring he could never expose the full extent of their crimes.

Olivia's emotions churned violently. She couldn't fathom her mother capable of such atrocities. Yet as the truth unraveled, the impossible became undeniable: Margaret, Donovan's own mother, had orchestrated his years of suffering.

Donovan hesitated before continuing, "I know it's difficult to believe. I struggled to accept it myself at first. But soon, we'll understand my mother's motives."

Just then, commotion erupted at the door. Reginald's voice called out, "Donovan, is Olivia awake?"

"Yes," Donovan answered as he opened the door.

Reginald entered first, looking every bit as haggard as Donovan had described. Dark circles shadowed his eyes, his movements stiff as if each step caused him pain. Having spent the entire night on his knees, Reginald was clearly suffering.

Yet the moment his gaze landed on Olivia lying in the hospital bed, his eyes filled with tears. Without hesitation, he dropped to his knees before her.

Startled, Olivia exclaimed, "Reginald, what are you doing? Please, get up."

But Reginald shook his head, delivering a sharp slap to his own cheek.

"This is all my fault. I failed to recognize the darkness in my wife's heart and stop her in time. Had I not brought her into our lives, none of this would have happened."

"I'm so sorry, Olivia. I've seen what they did to Isabelle. It was monstrous. I'm not asking for your forgiveness, but please know Donovan cares deeply for you. Don't hold this against him."

Tears welled in Olivia's eyes as she absorbed his words.

###Chapter 338

Donovan stepped forward, offering his hand to help Reginald rise. "Olivia has just regained consciousness. The physician recommended complete rest. Let's conclude this matter swiftly so she can recover properly."

With Donovan's support, Reginald stood and nodded in agreement.

Yet when Reginald turned, his expression hardened into an unyielding mask. "Bring her in!"

A team of security personnel escorted in a disheveled woman screaming obscenities. With closer inspection, it became clear her venom was directed at Olivia.

Olivia studied the woman's face through the tangled hair. Despite the wild appearance, recognition flashed in her eyes. It was Margaret.

"Margaret." A spark of revulsion flickered in Olivia's gaze. "I never imagined our reunion would occur under such circumstances."

Margaret lifted her chin, her eyes burning with decades-old hatred. "You're exactly like your mother - a scheming enchantress! She bewitched them all, and now you're doing the same!"

Olivia drew a steadying breath before responding with measured calm. "Margaret, if you confess your motives now, I may show mercy." The truth was, Olivia had no intention of forgiveness. This was purely a strategic play to uncover the truth about Vivienne's past.

Defeated, Margaret collapsed to the floor, her eyes devoid of life. "Fine," she whispered hoarsely. "I'll tell you everything."

Margaret had despised Vivienne from the moment she married into the Kensington family, her jealousy poisoning her mind. Her own marriage to Reginald had been arranged, devoid of affection - a bitter contrast to Vivienne's charmed existence.

While Vivienne enjoyed being the cherished only daughter, adored by her parents and brothers alike, Margaret endured a loveless union. Reginald's affection was reserved solely for his sister Vivienne, who lived like royalty within the family estate.

The final insult came when Margaret's extramarital affair was exposed. She became convinced Vivienne had orchestrated the scandal, though the truth remained unclear. This suspicion festered into an all-consuming hatred.

Margaret meticulously plotted Vivienne's downfall, taking malicious pleasure when heartbreak finally drove Vivienne from the Kensington mansion. For years, Margaret believed she'd won - until Olivia's unexpected return.

Seeing Olivia - Vivienne's mirror image - receiving the same adoration from the Kensingtons, particularly from Donovan and Alistair, rekindled Margaret's bitter resentment. Seraphina's failure to win the family's favor only deepened Margaret's twisted sympathy for her.

The past had come full circle, and now Margaret would face the consequences of her decades-long vendetta.
###Chapter 339

While pity played its part, the true motive behind Margaret Kensington's actions was her relentless pursuit to manipulate Seraphina for personal advantage.

At this critical juncture, whether Seraphina still drew breath remained an enigma to all.

With Margaret's sinister plot unfolding, the Kensington family found themselves with no alternative but to comply with her demands.

Their malicious scheme aimed to silence Isabelle permanently, with the ultimate goal of driving Olivia Sinclair from the Kensington household in utter disgrace, mirroring Vivienne's tragic past. Should they succeed, the 30% inheritance designated for Olivia would be divided among them. The plan progressed without hindrance - until the mysterious masked figure known as Mr. Jack made his unexpected appearance.

Alerted to the unfolding crisis, Donovan and Reginald Kensington rushed back immediately.

"If our plan had succeeded, your precious daughter would have been left mute and disabled, just like you were all those years ago!" Margaret spat venomously. Her excitement visibly grew with each word, culminating in a triumphant cackle as she envisioned her imagined victory.

Hearing this, Olivia's gaze locked with Donovan's, her maternal fears for Isabelle painfully evident.

Noticing her distress, Donovan quickly attempted reassurance. "Don't worry, Isabelle can still speak - her throat's just injured. The doctors believe full recovery is possible with time. Though we arrived later than hoped, we intervened before the entire dose was administered."

With a heavy, sorrow-laden sigh, Olivia closed her eyes.

Only now did she finally comprehend the true meaning behind Vivienne's words in that fateful letter.

Vivienne had written: "Olivia, should you ever return to the Kensington family, please find Margaret and deliver my messages. Tell her I wasn't responsible for what happened back then. And that I've always cherished our time together."

Previously, Olivia couldn't fathom such a request. Margaret had shown her nothing but contempt, their every interaction laced with biting sarcasm. Thus, Olivia had dismissed her mother's plea to relay these words.

Now, with the truth revealed, everything became painfully clear to Olivia.

Vivienne had likely never realized that what she perceived as genuine friendship with Margaret was, in reality, nothing but an elaborately staged deception.

Donovan's icy voice shattered Olivia's reverie. "Olivia, how shall we make her pay? The choice is yours."

Margaret's laughter rang out abruptly before cutting off as she stared at Donovan in stunned disbelief. "Donovan Kensington!" she shrieked, her voice sharp with incredulity. "How dare you! I'm your mother! Not only do you side with her against me, but you want me punished? You ungrateful wretch!"

Donovan merely smirked, his tone laced with bitter irony. "Did you ever consider yourself my mother when you arranged my kidnapping just to hurt Vivienne? I've always known you loved another man and cared nothing for Father, but I never imagined you'd feel nothing for me either."

Olivia studied Donovan closely, noting his bloodshot eyes. This marked the first time she'd witnessed this vulnerable side of him, breaking through his usual composed facade.

She understood completely. Discovering that the architect of his childhood trauma - the kidnapping that scarred him both physically and emotionally - was his own mother would devastate anyone.
###Chapter 340

Olivia watched in silence as Margaret Kensington's face twisted with desperation. The woman who had caused so much pain now stood trembling before them, her carefully constructed facade crumbling.

Donovan Kensington's expression remained unreadable as his mother clutched at his sleeves. "Please," Margaret begged, tears streaming down her face. "I'm your mother! Doesn't that mean anything to you?"

A bitter laugh escaped Donovan's lips. "You only remember you're my mother when it serves your purposes." His voice carried years of suppressed hurt. "How many times did I beg for just an hour of your time? How many school events did you miss because your social calendar was more important?"

Margaret opened her mouth to protest, but Olivia cut in. "Enough." Her voice sliced through the tension like a knife. "You poisoned my mother. You tried to destroy my daughter. Did you really think there wouldn't be consequences?"

Reginald Kensington looked decades older as he stepped forward. "Do what you must, Olivia. I wash my hands of this woman." His voice cracked. "Thirty years of marriage, and I never truly knew her."

Margaret's eyes darted between them wildly. "You can't do this! I'm a Kensington!" Her shrill voice echoed through the room.

Olivia exchanged a glance with Donovan. "Actually," she said coolly, "not for much longer." She nodded to the security team. "Take her away. Make sure she experiences exactly what Isabelle endured."

As the guards moved forward, Margaret lunged at Donovan one last time. "You ungrateful brat! After everything I sacrificed for you!" Her nails scraped against his arm as they dragged her away.

When the door slammed shut, the room fell into heavy silence. Olivia expected Donovan to break down, but instead he turned to her with surprising composure. "Now," he said, his voice low with concern, "tell me about this mysterious client of yours."

Olivia hesitated. The memory of the masked man sent a chill down her spine. "It's complicated," she admitted. "Someone sabotaged a shipment, and now I owe him a favor."

Donovan's jaw tightened. "Name him. Let me handle this."

"You?" Olivia arched an eyebrow. "The great Donovan Kensington actually worried about someone? This must be serious."

Running a hand through his hair, Donovan sighed. "Just promise me you'll be careful. This isn't some corporate rival we're dealing with." His usually confident demeanor faltered for the first time. "There are players in this game even I can't protect you from."

The gravity of his warning settled over them both. Outside, the first drops of rain began to patter against the windows, as if nature itself sensed the storm brewing on the horizon.
###Chapter 341

Olivia sensed the hidden meaning behind Donovan's words, but she chose not to dwell on it. If the masked man truly meant her harm, he would have used his financial power and influence directly instead of playing games with inferior products.

Though the masked man's true motives remained a mystery, Olivia understood that with such unpredictable individuals, compliance was often the safest path.

"I know what I'm doing," Olivia reassured Donovan. "As you can see, he's not someone easily deceived. Your methods might only provoke him. I'll be returning to Eldermere soon. With the Kensington family's support, I have nothing to fear."

The determination in Olivia's eyes slightly eased Donovan's worries, but he still wanted to argue further when a sharp knock interrupted them.

"Who is it?" Donovan asked sharply, turning toward the door.

A cheerful male voice responded, "Excuse me, is Olivia Sinclair here? My master requests her presence."

As Donovan moved to dismiss the visitor, Olivia caught his wrist, shaking her head subtly. She cleared her throat. "I'm here. Perfect timing - I wanted to express my gratitude personally."

The door swung open to reveal the masked man entering with Oliver Hart.

"No thanks necessary. Though your cousin seems rather hostile toward me. I might have been thrown out if not for playing the hero," the masked man remarked. Though his face remained hidden, a slight curl of his lips betrayed his irritation.

Donovan's expression darkened, his eyes turning icy. "Can't you see her condition? She needs rest, not disturbances."

The masked man remained silent, his piercing gaze fixed on Olivia.

"Donovan," Olivia said hesitantly, "I need to speak with him briefly. Don't worry. Our family's security is outside, and this is a Kensington-owned hospital. He wouldn't dare try anything."

After a long, wary look at the masked man, Donovan finally left the room, though his concern was palpable.

"Thank you for saving me. I owe you a debt. Name your price - if it's within my power, consider it done," Olivia said earnestly.

The masked man remained silent, his gaze inscrutable.

Olivia swallowed hard. "Or perhaps... you have a specific way you'd like me to repay you?"

The masked man settled into a chair with regal grace, as if it were a throne. "Olivia, you finally understand. As your savior, it's only fitting I dictate the terms of your repayment, don't you agree?"

A flicker of unease crossed Olivia's face. Her fingers twitched slightly. "Please, Mr. Jack, tell me what you want."

Mr. Jack took his time, rhythmically tapping the armrest, making the seconds stretch into minutes. Ten agonizing minutes passed.

Olivia's palms grew damp. She prided herself on her composure, but Mr. Jack was clearly toying with her, and it was working.
###Chapter 342

The silence stretched between them until Mr. Jack finally broke it. "Returning to Eldermere? I have some business there that requires attention. Would you assist me with it?" His voice carried that familiar commanding tone. "While I'd prefer to handle it personally, my current obligations prevent me. As per our agreement, you should have delivered the restored artifact by now. Given your circumstances, I'm willing to extend the deadline. But don't mistake this for unlimited patience."

Olivia's brow furrowed. "Business management isn't exactly my expertise."

She couldn't comprehend why he'd entrust this to her instead of someone from his inner circle. Her experience consisted solely of overseeing a few auction houses - she'd never built a company from scratch.

Mr. Jack's lips curved into a knowing smile. "Olivia, while others remain oblivious, I'm well acquainted with those specialized training programs you've completed. Those million-dollar management courses must have imparted some valuable skills."

Her eyes widened in alarm. "How could you possibly know about that?" Her voice trembled with barely contained shock.

Those were her carefully guarded secrets - information she'd withheld even from Donovan and Alistair. Yet Mr. Jack knew every detail.

He rose gracefully and approached her bedside.

"Haven't I told you I know everything worth knowing in this world?" His gaze bore into hers. "I recognize your ambition and potential, Olivia. But you must exercise greater caution. Instead of panicking, use this as an opportunity for reflection. Consider yourself fortunate I'm not your enemy - you wouldn't be breathing otherwise."

Olivia found herself speechless. Studying Mr. Jack's composed demeanor, her suspicions intensified. The way he issued warnings mirrored Liam's distinctive style uncannily.

As she studied his masked face, Olivia burned with the desire to tear it away and confirm his identity. After a prolonged silence, she finally spoke. "If you're willing to place your trust in me, I'll give this my absolute best."

Mr. Jack responded with a rare, genuine smile. "Don't get ahead of yourself. There are conditions, and failure carries consequences. Though I have every confidence in your capabilities."

Olivia bit back the question burning on her tongue. Part of her desperately wanted to demand whether he was Liam in disguise. Yet another part recognized it no longer mattered.

If this was Liam choosing to conceal his identity, it signaled he'd moved beyond their shared history. Dwelling on it would only chain her to the past.

After Mr. Jack departed, the medical staff finally relented to Olivia's persistent requests to visit Isabelle.

Isabelle had regained consciousness but sat motionless in bed, surrounded by caretakers attempting to coax her into eating. The child remained silent and unresponsive until Olivia's wheelchair entered the room.

"Let me try," Olivia said, accepting the bowl from the frustrated caretakers.

Only at the sound of Olivia's voice did Isabelle stir. Recognition flashed in her eyes as she attempted to rise, only to be gently restrained by the attendants.

"Isabelle, darling, you mustn't move," Olivia cautioned softly. "The doctors were very clear - any sudden movements mean another injection."
###Chapter 343

"Exactly, Isabelle. You'll recover faster if you follow the doctor's orders and rest properly."

Today, Isabelle was being uncharacteristically defiant. Her small hands trembled as she reached for Olivia, desperate for her mother's embrace.

Olivia's stomach twisted when she noticed the IV line ready for blood extraction. Adopting a firm tone, she warned, "Isabelle, if you don't cooperate, Mommy will get very upset."

The words made Isabelle freeze instantly. Silent tears rolled down her pale cheeks.

Moving to the bedside, Olivia gently wiped away her daughter's tears, forcing a reassuring smile that quickly dissolved into her own tears. "I'm so sorry, sweetheart," she whispered, guilt crushing her chest. "This is all my fault. I should have kept you safer."

Isabelle shook her head vigorously. When she spoke, her voice was raspy but determined. "Not your fault. Mine. Mommy, don't cry. Be strong too."

The nurses exchanged surprised glances.

"Remarkable. Her mother truly makes a difference. We've been wondering about her vocal recovery, but she barely spoke until now."

Olivia dabbed her eyes and addressed the medical staff. "Thank you all for your patience. Isabelle may be young, but she's incredibly proud. This situation is difficult for her to accept. Please bear with her a little longer."

The nurses immediately praised Isabelle's maturity beyond her years.

"Not a problem at all. She's been exceptionally well-behaved, though reluctant to speak or eat. During injections especially - she never fights us. That quiet bravery breaks our hearts every time."

"Oh, it's devastating. What kind of monster would hurt such an angelic child?"

Olivia's hands clenched at the comment. Even strangers could see how precious Isabelle was.

After gentle persuasion, Isabelle finally managed a small smile.

The once-vibrant child had become withdrawn since the incident, still visibly affected by her trauma.

Though no one had described the attack's details to Olivia, she could imagine the terror her daughter must have endured.

Having extended her own hospital stay, Olivia decided against returning to the Kensington estate. She planned to take Isabelle to Eldermere upon discharge - a decision that clearly displeased Donovan.

At the hotel suite, the bodyguard escorted Olivia inside where Donovan waited unexpectedly accompanied by Alistair.

Alistair's face lit up when he saw Olivia. He rushed forward eagerly. "Olivia! Where have you been hiding? I've missed you terribly!"

Olivia's startled gaze flew to Donovan for explanation.

Donovan merely shrugged helplessly. Alistair was having another episode.

These days, Alistair remained lucid only half the time. Even during coherent moments, he often refused to speak. His silence always signaled another impending spiral.
###Chapter 344

Olivia Sinclair couldn't comprehend why Donovan Kensington had brought Alistair Kensington to this place.

After calming Alistair down with gentle words, Olivia pulled Donovan aside. "I understand my choice appears abrupt, and it probably angers you, but there's no alternative. It's not merely about my disillusionment with the Kensington family. There are other pressing matters demanding my attention."

Donovan cleared his throat quietly.

"I do find your decision rather hasty. But what troubles me more is Alistair's mental state. You should bid him farewell properly, Olivia. Whether he's fully aware or not, he listens to you more than anyone. Even when he refuses to speak with others, he always makes an exception for you. Imagine how he'll deteriorate if you depart?"

Olivia's chest constricted painfully as distress flooded through her. She hadn't even contemplated this consequence.

At that moment, Alistair approached them, his face etched with confusion. "Olivia, are you leaving? Can I come with you? Please don't abandon me here with these Kensingtons. They're all strangers to me, and I want nothing to do with them."

Olivia turned to face Alistair, preparing to reassure him and persuade him to remain.

But before she could utter a word, Donovan gently grasped her wrist, giving an almost imperceptible shake of his head, silently urging her to refrain.

Then Donovan offered an awkward smile. "I was hoping you might take our grandfather to your residence. I wouldn't have brought him here today otherwise."

Alistair's eyes reddened with irritation as he snapped at Donovan, "Don't address me like that! Brat, how could I possibly be your grandfather? I'm far too youthful for such a title!"

Olivia felt a vein throb at her temple, her expression turning grave.

"Donovan, are you truly serious about this? It's not that I'm unwilling to take Alistair with me, but I refuse to exploit the Kensington family's power. Given my hectic schedule, I doubt I could properly care for him. What if something happens? That's a situation none of us want to face."

"Moreover..." Olivia's gaze dropped, the light in her eyes dimming. "I couldn't even protect Isabelle, let alone—"

"You needn't worry about that. I've arranged everything," Donovan assured her, his voice steady.

"Alistair was quite influential in his prime, having assisted numerous people and earned widespread respect. It's no exaggeration to say he's acquainted with half of Crestwood's elite, with connections spanning all social circles in Eldermere. I've already spoken with his associates. Should you ever require aid, simply present this." Donovan produced an exquisite jade pendant and pressed it into Olivia's palm.

Olivia examined the artifact, marveling at its flawless, cool surface. This was undoubtedly premium quality jade, far too precious to serve as a mere token.

Her mind flashed back years earlier when she'd encountered a tiny jade fragment in an underground market. Barely the size of a thumbnail, it had sold for fifty million.

As for this piece's value, Olivia estimated it was beyond most people's means. She frowned and returned the jade to Donovan. "Give me something less conspicuous. This is far too valuable to carry around."
###Chapter 345

Donovan shook his head firmly. "This belonged to Alistair. Just keep it with you. If you ever need funds, sell it. It's valued at least in the hundreds of millions. It'll support you through any hardship."

Olivia's lips curved in disbelief. "Are you serious? Suggesting I pawn this right in front of Alistair?"

Donovan waved his hand dismissively. "He's got vaults full of treasures. This means nothing to him. Just take good care of him."

He then pressed a stack of black credit cards from elite banks and a set of penthouse keys into her palm.

Olivia opened her mouth to refuse when Donovan's expression darkened, his voice turning glacial. "If you decline, I'll ensure you never leave Westhaven."

She didn't doubt his power for a second.

With a weary sigh, Donovan's tone softened. "As your cousin, I've failed you. My life's consumed by obligations, leaving little to give. If you reject this, I'll never forgive myself."

A sudden tightness gripped Olivia's chest, emotions swelling like a tidal wave. The urge to cry became overwhelming.

Memories surfaced of her early days with the Winslow family, when Henry was still alive and she was married to Liam. Those rare moments of familial warmth now seemed like fragments of a fading dream.

Later, kind souls had entered her orbit - the warmth from the Whitmores and Bennetts. Gregory's kindness hadn't faded from memory either.

Olivia cherished these gestures profoundly. Perhaps because she'd spent most of her life as the Winslows' adopted daughter, constantly scrutinized, she'd never permitted herself to depend on anyone.

Before she realized, hot tears spilled down her cheeks.

Donovan noticed immediately, brushing them away with his thumb. "Hey now, none of that. My fault - shouldn't have gotten sentimental. Everything's arranged. Take my private jet tomorrow. Just rest now, alright?"

Olivia sniffed, forcing a small smile. "Alright."

After much-needed recuperation, Olivia returned home with Isabelle and Alistair.

True to his word, Donovan had orchestrated every detail flawlessly.

With Olivia's leg still healing, she remained wheelchair-bound.

Upon landing, they rested at the penthouse, but inactivity chafed at Olivia. She insisted on visiting Crestwood's auction house, eager to inspect her newest acquisition.

Despite its recent opening, the Crestwood auction house thrived. The manager reported every event sold out completely.

To meet demand, he'd hired additional staff and promised to introduce them later.

Olivia found the notion tedious and declined. She trusted her managers implicitly - each carefully selected for their expertise. Micromanaging hires wasn't her style.
###Chapter 346

Olivia Sinclair had come to the auction house with purpose. Since she was already present, she decided to make her first purchase since returning to Crestwood. She dismissed the manager with a wave of her hand and directed her wheelchair toward the prestigious No. 1 private room.

Her path was abruptly blocked by a wall of black-suited bodyguards.

Olivia's eyebrows arched in silent question. The manager had specifically mentioned this room wasn't reserved.

A nearby attendant rushed forward. "Excuse me, but who occupies this room? Our records show it wasn't booked today. Could there be some mistake?"

Before anyone could respond, a middle-aged man with an air of superiority emerged. His tailored suit screamed wealth, marking him as some aristocrat's personal attendant. Olivia remained hidden behind her oversized sunglasses and silk mask - not yet ready to reveal her identity on her first day back in Crestwood.

The butler barely glanced at Olivia before addressing the attendant with dripping condescension. "We didn't make reservations because we hadn't planned to come. My mistress decided to grace your establishment on a whim. Does it truly matter now that we're here? You should consider it an honor that she chose your venue at all."

A soft chuckle escaped Olivia's lips.

The attendant's expression hardened. "Is that so? Then your mistress must be quite important. Perhaps you'd care to share her name?"

The butler's smirk turned predatory, his patience visibly thinning. "Clearly you're new to Crestwood if you don't recognize my mistress. Otherwise, you wouldn't dare challenge her for this room."

With a flick of his wrist, the butler produced something that made the attendant's neutral expression transform into alarm. He leaned close to Olivia, whispering urgently, "That's Sebastian Whitmore's fiancée - our auction director. They're to be married soon. She rarely visits, but when she does..."

His voice dropped lower. "For some reason she's insisting on this particular room today. Should I notify Mr. Whitmore?"

Olivia gave an almost imperceptible nod. She had no desire to cause trouble for her employees' families. Though she found Sebastian's fiancée distasteful, she couldn't deny the auction house had flourished under his management. This petty squabble wasn't worth ruining her homecoming.

"Never mind," Olivia said, her voice like winter frost. "The second private room will suffice."

The attendant nodded and began maneuvering Olivia's wheelchair away.

Unexpectedly, the butler stepped directly into their path, his gaze locked onto Olivia. "Just who exactly are you? You still haven't identified yourself. Gaining access to private room No. 1 isn't something just anyone can do."

The attendant's voice turned icy. "Who she is and where she's from doesn't concern you. What matters is she's not someone your mistress can afford to cross."

With that final warning, the attendant guided Olivia away.

The butler spat on the polished floor, muttering curses as he stormed back into the private room.

Behind an ornate screen in the No. 1 private room, a voluptuous woman lounged with visible irritation. Her honeyed voice carried an edge as sharp as broken glass. "Who does that presumptuous cripple think she is? How dare she attempt to take what's mine?"

The butler sighed dramatically. "She refused to identify herself, yet everyone treats her with deference. From her bearing alone... had she insisted on this room, we would have had no choice but to vacate."

###Chapter 347

The moment the butler finished speaking, a delicate porcelain vase toppled from its stand, shattering into pieces across the marble floor.

"Who does that little bitch think she is?" The woman's voice dripped with venom. "Doesn't she know my fiancé manages this auction house?"

The butler cleared his throat. "She's aware, Miss Dawson. And she doesn't seem to care."

A bodyguard entered, shifting uncomfortably. "Miss, Mr. Whitmore has arrived—but he went directly to Private Room No. 2."

Silence thickened the air. The woman's lips curled into a sneer. "Ah. So she's one of those masked temptresses, trying to catch Sebastian's eye. Well, I want to see the face of the woman bold enough to set her sights on my man."

Upon hearing the staff's report, Sebastian Whitmore rushed to Private Room No. 2. He stood before Olivia Sinclair with an apologetic bow. "My sincerest apologies. My schedule has been chaotic today. I had no idea my fiancée was here. Just give me a moment to handle this."

Olivia had removed her mask, revealing striking features that needed no embellishment. Her flawless complexion glowed under the soft lighting as she gazed out the window with detached serenity.

"Unnecessary. I won’t be visiting Crestwood often. I merely wanted to understand local tastes. The staff already explained your fiancée frequents this place without disrupting operations."

She turned, her smile faint behind the translucent screen. "Sebastian, you’re the eldest son of the Whitmores. I’m fortunate to have you managing my auction house. No need for formalities."

Sebastian’s ears flushed at her words. "Even so, working here has always been my dream. Your support made it possible. For that, I’m grateful."

The Whitmore family was wealthy, much like the Kensingtons, with roots not in Eldermere but abroad.

From childhood, Sebastian’s passion for antiques set him apart. His family disapproved, pressuring him to take over their business empire.

Then he applied to Olivia’s auction house.

Recognizing his talent, Olivia fought to keep him. After lengthy negotiations with the Whitmores, she secured his position. She suspected their agreement came with ulterior motives—hoping to pair them romantically. But Olivia had made her stance clear from the start.

She hired him for his skill, not for matchmaking. Balancing family and work was already taxing enough.

Sebastian understood. He had kept his growing feelings locked away for years.

As the last of the staff exited, Sebastian lingered, his handsome face shadowed with concern. "Olivia, your leg—"

###Chapter 348

Olivia's lips curved into a gentle smile. "It's just a minor injury. I'll be back to normal in no time."

Sebastian's voice held an undercurrent of concern. "You shouldn't dismiss this so lightly. Proper medical attention is crucial. I know an exceptional physician specializing in such injuries - his treatments are remarkably effective without any side effects."

"He comes from a long line of traditional healers. Though he refuses to work in prestigious hospitals due to his disdain for chasing fame, his skills are unmatched. I can personally vouch for his expertise."

Olivia's smile deepened. "That's very kind of you. Please arrange the appointment at your earliest convenience." Sebastian's face brightened visibly at her acceptance.

"Don't trouble yourself about her leg. She already has plenty of people worrying over her." A deep, measured voice interrupted from the doorway.

Both Olivia and Sebastian turned to see a tall figure in a tailored black coat and signature mask standing at the threshold. His distinctive attire left no doubt about his identity.

"Mr. Blackwood? What brings you here?" Sebastian inquired.

Liam stepped into the room with effortless grace. "The premier suite is occupied, and I find the other rooms unsatisfactory. I came to ask if Olivia would mind sharing her private room with me."

Olivia offered a faint, noncommittal smile but remained silent. Sebastian's expression darkened. "That's hardly appropriate, Mr. Blackwood. Olivia values her privacy. I'll arrange alternative accommodations for you."

Liam turned his masked face toward Sebastian. Though his eyes remained hidden, an icy intensity radiated from his gaze. "Your superior hasn't refused yet. Why are you so eager to speak for her?"

"She's never denied any of my requests before. Do you realize you're creating unnecessary complications for her?" Liam's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper as he issued his warning.

Sebastian couldn't miss the thinly veiled threat. Cold sweat beaded on his forehead as he glanced nervously at Olivia, who remained partially concealed behind the ornate screen.

Rubbing her temples, Olivia interjected, "Sebastian, the auction is about to begin, and you have responsibilities to attend to. Please focus on your duties. Mr. Blackwood and I are well acquainted."

Reluctantly, Sebastian nodded and withdrew, casting one last wary glance at Liam before exiting.

Liam settled himself comfortably across from Olivia and poured tea with practiced ease.

Olivia's eyelid twitched slightly at his casual disregard for formalities.

"You already have my contact information, Mr. Blackwood," Olivia remarked. "If you're here to pressure me about that assignment, a message would have sufficed."

Liam set his cup down delicately, perhaps remembering his mask. "Olivia, you misunderstand. As I mentioned, I intended to use the premier suite but found it occupied. Having visited your auction house in Westhaven, I'm curious to see how the Eldermere branch compares."

A proud smile touched Olivia's lips as she lifted her chin slightly. "You won't be disappointed. We've curated exceptional pieces here. Eldermere's vast territory and rich history have yielded remarkable cultural treasures."

The auction soon commenced.

Initially, Olivia hadn't planned to bid on anything, her primary goal being to observe the auction's proceedings while gauging local preferences.

###Chapter 349

The auction hall buzzed with anticipation as Olivia Sinclair scanned the catalog. Among the exquisite items, one particular piece captured her attention - an ancient harp, meticulously restored yet still playable. Lately, Olivia had developed a fascination with musical instruments, and with both time and wealth at her disposal, she decided to indulge this new passion.

The bidding started slow, giving Olivia the perfect opportunity to place her offer. Her substantial bid initially deterred other participants.

Just as victory seemed certain, a counteroffer came from the No. 1 private suite - a mere two hundred thousand above Olivia's last bid.

Olivia's eyebrows knitted together as she sensed something peculiar. She cautiously raised her bid again.

The No. 1 suite immediately responded with another minimal increase of two hundred thousand.

Such predatory bidding tactics would normally be prohibited. However, the staff recognized the occupant of the No. 1 suite as Sebastian Whitmore's fiancée, Victoria Clarke, and no one dared intervene.

Olivia couldn't comprehend why Victoria harbored such hostility toward her.

When Victoria placed another bid, Olivia withdrew. "Let her have it," she murmured under her breath.

Victoria's smug laughter echoed through her private suite. "Already surrendering? How pathetic! I expected more of a challenge. Five million is pocket change - if she can't handle that, she shouldn't be here."

Her butler, Alfred, chimed in, "The woman clearly doesn't know who she's dealing with. But isn't this harp rather expensive for something you don't even want?"

Victoria's crimson lips curled into a sneer. "I don't care about the harp. I won't tolerate that woman flaunting herself around Sebastian. I'll take this harp just to smash it before her eyes. Besides, this is Sebastian's auction house - I get whatever I desire here."

Alfred checked his watch discreetly. "Miss Clarke, it's time."

Victoria reluctantly stood and activated her live stream. In an instant, her petulant expression transformed into a radiant smile for her audience.

"Hello my darlings!" she cooed into the camera. "I'm at the most exclusive auction house tonight. Let me show you all the excitement! Don't worry about photography restrictions - I have special privileges here."

She gestured dramatically around the lavish suite. "This is the premier private room - completely secluded from the common rabble down there."

Taking the cue, Alfred fabricated, "Miss, the occupants of Suite No. 2 are quite upset about losing the harp to you. They're actually cursing your name."

Victoria's face instantly adopted an innocent expression as she raised her voice for her streaming audience. "But this is how auctions work, isn't it? Highest bid wins. I've played completely fairly - why would anyone insult me over that?"

Alfred tsked disapprovingly. "Some people simply can't handle losing when they're outmatched financially."

###Chapter 350

The live stream viewership had skyrocketed past fifteen thousand, with comments flooding in at lightning speed. Some cheered for Sebastian Whitmore's fiancée, while others mocked the mysterious occupants of the No. 2 private room.

Before the auctioneer could declare the harp sold to the No. 1 private room, a new bid flashed across the display.

Evelyn Hartley sighed dramatically, swirling her champagne flute. "Another bid? Probably just pocket change to irritate me."

Her words barely left her lips when the auctioneer's voice boomed through the grand hall. "No. 2 private room counters with twenty million dollars!"

Evelyn's perfectly manicured nails dug into her palms. Olivia Sinclair's eyebrows shot up as she turned to Liam Blackwood in disbelief. Yet the masked man remained utterly unfazed, as if discussing the weather rather than spending a fortune.

"Mr. Blackwood..." Olivia hesitated before voicing her confusion. "May I ask why you're bidding?"

Liam leaned back in his plush chair, fingers steepled beneath his chin. Though his expression remained hidden behind the silver mask, amusement colored his tone.

"Isn't it obvious? When I want something, I acquire it. The No. 1 room's petty two-hundred-thousand increments bored me to tears."

Olivia's lips parted, then closed. She forced a polite smile. "I merely thought the harp hardly warrants such extravagance."

Despite its historical significance, the instrument showed obvious restoration marks that diminished its value. Liam merely shrugged. "Market value means nothing. Only my personal valuation matters."

True to form, the No. 1 private room fired back with another bid.

Without missing a beat, Liam gestured lazily. "Thirty million."

When the next counteroffer came, he didn't hesitate. "Forty million."

Olivia sipped her tea, watching the spectacle unfold with detached interest. It wasn't her fortune being spent, after all. Her gaze kept drifting to Liam's profile, wondering if he truly was who she suspected. If so, how had he amassed such wealth? To him, millions flowed like water from a faucet.

In the No. 1 private room, Evelyn's face burned crimson with rage while cold sweat soaked through her designer gown. "Absolute lunatic!" she hissed between clenched teeth. Forty million for a restored harp? This had to be some elaborate joke.

Fear of financial ruin finally outweighed her pride. Even adding her usual hundred-thousand increment seemed ludicrous against such astronomical figures. The harp simply wasn't worth it.

With bitter reluctance, Evelyn withdrew from the bidding, convinced Olivia had orchestrated this humiliation. "That scheming witch!" she spat, hurling her crystal glass against the wall where it shattered like her composure.

Her butler swiftly angled the camera away, shielding the live stream audience from witnessing her meltdown.

An idea suddenly struck the butler as he stroked his chin. "Miss Hartley, that woman couldn't possibly afford such sums. Perhaps her funds come from... questionable sources?"

Evelyn caught his meaning instantly. Tears welled in her eyes as she turned her flawless face toward the live stream camera. "You think Sebastian finances her? Impossible! He's always been devoted to me. No matter how many women throw themselves at him, he remains a man of honor."

###Chapter 351

The butler's expression turned grave as he played along with her charade. "While Mr. Whitmore is respectable, we can't vouch for others. Miss, he was probably deceived. That woman lacks all decency. Not only does she parade as a kept woman, but she also spends your fiancé's fortune recklessly. And the audacity - openly provoking you like this!"

The live stream audience erupted in fury at their staged conversation, demanding to see this shameless mistress for themselves.

Inside Private Room No. 2, Olivia remained blissfully unaware she was being branded a mistress.

The antique harp arrived at their private room. Oliver carefully cradled the velvet-wrapped instrument, preparing to leave when Mr. Blackwood's sharp glance stopped him.

Understanding the unspoken command, Oliver hesitated before reluctantly placing the priceless harp before Olivia.

Startled, Olivia waved her hands in protest. "Mr. Blackwood, I can't possibly accept this."

He barely glanced at the harp, his tone deliberately casual. "Keep it. Just a few million. Trivial amount."

Her eyes widened. "You paid fifty million! Even if you insist, I won't take it."

Mr. Blackwood studied her earnest face before chuckling. "Wait. I haven't finished. Recall that business matter I needed your help with? If it doesn't yield fifty million profit next month, you'll cover the difference. Difficult task, but you agreed. Perhaps reconsider accepting this harp."

Assuming he was serious, Olivia gritted her teeth. "Why mention this only now?"

With an unrepentant shrug, he replied, "Slipped my mind earlier. Consider the harp my apology. You do remember owing me a life debt, yes? Don't tell me you regret our agreement now."

His words choked back her immediate refusal.

Taking a steadying breath, Olivia snatched the harp from the table and signaled her bodyguard to wheel her out.

Once Olivia departed, Oliver muttered bitterly, "You bankrupt yourself to please her, then disguise it with your twisted words. Why bother?"

Mr. Blackwood coolly lifted Oliver's collar. "One more word and you'll train under Sebastian in Valtierra until you collapse." Oliver immediately sealed his lips.

Fuming, Olivia returned home. Having trusted Mr. Blackwood's words, her frustration simmered. Yet she felt powerless. Were all wealthy men this manipulative? Doubts crept in. Perhaps Mr. Blackwood wasn't Liam after all. Liam would never treat her this way, no matter the circumstances.

At the villa, Alistair and Isabelle were playing in the gardens. Isabelle's voice had nearly returned, though she still preferred silence. Their radiant happiness was unmistakable, the joyful scene perfectly visible from Olivia's balcony vantage point.
###Chapter 352

Olivia Sinclair stood by the window, watching the city lights twinkle below when her assistant approached with quiet urgency. "Miss Sinclair, everything has been arranged as you instructed."

She gave a slight nod, her gaze never leaving the skyline.

Before returning to Eldermere, Olivia had deployed her team to infiltrate Blackwood Enterprises. Their mission was twofold - gather intelligence on company operations while discreetly investigating the current power dynamics within the Blackwood family. Her team's efficiency never failed to impress.

The compiled documents revealed troubling patterns. While Blackwood Enterprises maintained a facade of stability, the frequency of operational errors suggested deeper issues. The company was declining rapidly, teetering on the brink of collapse. Without Liam at the helm, the once-mighty corporation had become like a declawed tiger - all show with no real power.

An unexpected pang of sympathy struck Olivia, reserved solely for Henry Winslow. Had he lived to see his family's legacy crumble, it would have shattered him.

"Shall we move against Blackwood Enterprises with this information?" her assistant inquired.

Olivia shook her head, her lips curving into a knowing smile. "Destroying them would be child's play, but that's not my objective. I only want what's rightfully mine. Besides," she added with a dismissive wave, "why waste energy on their downfall?"

As she massaged her temples, a thought occurred to her. "Who's currently leading Blackwood Enterprises?"

"Victor Blackwood. Though once considered an outsider due to his... questionable parentage, he's since been legitimized by the family."

Interest sparked in Olivia's eyes. "Reach out to him. I want dinner tonight."

Her assistant hesitated. "That might prove difficult. Since taking over, he's become quite reclusive - avoids public appearances and rarely grants private audiences."

Unfazed, Olivia's smile turned confident. "Mention my name. That should change his mind."

True to her prediction, Victor responded immediately, even inquiring about her dining preferences.

"Reserve the most exclusive restaurant in Crestwood," Olivia instructed without hesitation.

As twilight descended, Olivia arrived precisely on time, though her entrance carried a hint of difficulty. "My apologies for the delay, Mr. Blackwood," she explained upon entering the private dining room. "Transportation issues, and these heels..." Her apology carried no real remorse, her posture radiating confidence.

Victor hadn't changed much over the years. The same mask covered half his face, revealing only his pale, handsome features. His warm eyes remained as deceptive as ever, capable of making one forget the darkness lurking beneath.

Olivia remembered all too well how those same hands had nearly ended her life. Yet here he stood, extending his hand as if they were old friends. "I've heard so much about your recent endeavors. I'm honored you'd choose to meet with me so soon after your return."

Her smile remained cool. "You flatter yourself, Mr. Blackwood. In Crestwood, your reputation precedes you. I haven't forgotten our... previous encounters."

The air between them crackled with unspoken history as they took their seats, the real game only just beginning.
###Chapter 353

A tense silence enveloped the private dining room.

Victor Blackwood's confident facade cracked momentarily, surprise flashing across his features at Olivia Sinclair's blunt approach.

Olivia remained composed, elegantly pouring tea into Victor's cup with steady hands. His fingers trembled slightly as he accepted the delicate china.

"You've... changed," Victor remarked, his voice less assured now. "I hardly recognize the woman before me. Your voice has returned, you've reclaimed your place in the Kensington family. You're far beyond my reach now." He adjusted his cuffs nervously. "Those past misunderstandings were largely due to Liam's interference. At least I came to my senses and let you go. Can't we leave the past behind us?"

Olivia's lips curled in barely concealed contempt. The audacity to frame his cowardice as benevolence! She remembered all too clearly how she'd orchestrated her own escape by manipulating Miranda Graves.

But dwelling on painful memories served no purpose. Olivia steered the conversation to her objective. "Let's be clear, Victor. This isn't a social call. Given your thorough research into my current situation, you must understand how opposing me would damage Blackwood Enterprises." She produced a leather-bound folder, sliding it across the polished mahogany table. "These properties were stolen from me by your family. It's time they were returned to their rightful owner."

Victor glanced at the documents and smirked. "Why come to me? Shouldn't you be demanding this from the Winslow family?"

Olivia's laugh held no warmth. "Aren't you the current head of Blackwood Enterprises now?"

Unfazed by his own contradiction, Victor adjusted his silk tie with deliberate slowness. "Here's the thing - while the Winslows may acknowledge me as family, I don't feel particularly connected to them." His smile turned predatory. "Besides, when your assets were seized, I wasn't even part of the family. Why should I be responsible for returning them?"

Disgust twisted Olivia's features. "If you refuse to cooperate, I'll take what's mine by force. The choice is yours, Victor."

Victor remained impassive. "A word of caution - the Winslow family may be struggling, but they're not to be underestimated. And these so-called assets you claim... do you even have proof of ownership?"

Now Olivia understood the depths of Victor's deceit. Her parents' hard-earned legacy, stolen by the Winslows. As head of Blackwood Enterprises, Victor had certainly reviewed all holdings - distinguishing her inheritance would be simple. His refusal confirmed he never intended to return what was rightfully hers.

With a glance at her assistant, Olivia rose. "We're leaving."

Her assistant blinked in surprise but immediately moved to follow. She trusted Olivia's judgment implicitly.

"Wait!" Victor suddenly called out. He hurried over with two crystal glasses of amber liquor, then did the unthinkable - he dropped to one knee before Olivia, head bowed in apparent contrition. "I understand now. The Winslows wronged you deeply." He extended a glass. "Please accept this toast as my apology. Now that you've returned, let's coexist peacefully. Can't we let bygones be bygones?"

Olivia's expression remained glacial, her silence more telling than any words.
###Chapter 354

Olivia's assistant swiftly knocked the document from Victor's grasp, sending it crashing to the marble floor. With an icy glare, she snapped, "How dare you make such preposterous demands? You should consider it a privilege that Ms. Sinclair even agreed to this meeting."

Victor's knuckles turned white as his hands clenched into fists. Though his lips curved into a smile, his voice carried dangerous undertones. "Olivia, your assistant seems to have forgotten her place. Surely you'll correct this... oversight?"

Olivia tilted her head, her crimson lips curling in disdain. "Forgotten her place? She merely speaks the truth I'm too polite to voice. I offered you the chance to cooperate and apologize, yet you squandered it. Without my summons, you wouldn't even be worthy to breathe the same air as me. You disgust me."

As she swept past him, Olivia deliberately shouldered Victor aside. This confrontation had been calculated - she'd known he wouldn't surrender easily. Gauging his reaction was crucial for planning her next move. Now that Victor had abandoned all pretense of civility, she saw no reason to maintain hers. He should be grateful she hadn't unleashed her full vengeance upon returning.

The moment Olivia settled into her car, her phone rang with Isabelle's sweet voice. "Mommy, where are you?"

As the car pulled away, Olivia watched the cityscape blur past her window, her tense expression softening. "I'll be home soon, darling. Keep Great-grandfather company until I arrive."

Isabelle's cheerful promise was followed by concern. "Please hurry back! The weather report says rain's coming. Great-grandfather says getting wet makes people sick. And he wants you to call Aunt Vivienne - he says she needs to come home."

Olivia's throat tightened before she could respond. A metallic screech tore through the air as the car lurched violently.

"Jesus Christ!" The driver's panicked shout pierced the cabin. "The brakes are gone!"

The mountain road's steep drop loomed beside them. Even if they avoided plunging off the cliff, the winding descent promised disaster.

Olivia's head snapped forward with a sickening crack against the window. The world swam before her eyes as warm blood trickled down her temple.

Through the chaos of squealing tires came Isabelle's terrified screams over the phone. Olivia fought to form comforting words, but her lips refused to obey.

Suddenly, blinding headlights flooded the interior. A freight truck's horn bellowed like some primordial beast charging toward its prey.

The driver's desperate maneuvers proved futile - with no brakes, collision was inevitable. Whether they careened off the mountain or into the truck's path, the outcome appeared equally fatal.

Olivia closed her eyes, bracing for impact.

The deafening crash came - but not the expected agony. "Holy hell!" her assistant gasped.

When Olivia dared to look, she saw a sleek black vehicle had materialized like a phantom, intercepting their deadly trajectory mere inches from the truck's grill.
###Chapter 355

The impact sent their out-of-control vehicle careening forward, the disabled brakes offering no resistance. The massive truck beside them hadn't fully stopped either.

Olivia's pulse hammered against her ribs as she realized their car might become the filling in a deadly metal sandwich. Miraculously, with mere inches to spare, all three vehicles shuddered to a stop.

The black sedan had taken the worst of it.

Their own situation wasn't much better. Smoke curled from the hood as the driver warned about leaking fuel.

Panicked shouts filled the air as everyone scrambled for safety. Olivia tried to move but cried out - her legs refused to cooperate.

Her assistant Evelyn reached for her, but the petite woman's hands were already injured from the initial impact. She lacked the strength to drag Olivia free.

"Go!" Olivia gasped, pushing weakly at Evelyn's arms. "Just leave me. Maybe this is how it's meant to be."

Evelyn's face contorted. "Don't you dare give up! That fuel could ignite any second!"

A bitter laugh escaped Olivia's lips. She willed her limbs to move, but the concussion left her dizzy and her hands numb.

This wasn't how she'd imagined her end. If she died here, it would look like a tragic accident rather than the carefully orchestrated murder it truly was. Despair clawed at her throat as she thought of the black car's occupants - they'd tried to help, only to meet the same fate.

Then a deep voice cut through the chaos. "Move!"

Olivia looked up into the familiar contours of a silver mask.

Mr. Liam's pale throat bore a crimson streak. Even his black dress shirt couldn't conceal the spreading bloodstain.

Olivia's breath hitched. Had he been in that black car?

Without ceremony, Mr. Liam bent and scooped her up, his powerful arms cradling her against his chest. The group stumbled away from the wreckage.

Seconds later, Olivia's car erupted in flames. The black sedan followed suit. The truck driver had wisely retreated several yards.

The inferno painted the twilight sky orange.

Olivia stared from the burning wreckage to the masked man holding her. "Why?" she whispered hoarsely. "Why risk yourself for me?"

His only answer was a sudden stagger.

The world tilted as Olivia instinctively tightened her grip around Mr. Liam's neck.

He collapsed to his knees, muscles trembling with exhaustion, yet refused to drop her. A pained grunt escaped him as veins stood out along his forearms.

When Olivia tried to wriggle free, Mr. Liam pitched forward, consciousness abandoning him completely.

###Chapter 356

Olivia gasped, her hands shaking violently as she clutched at Liam's shoulders. "Mr. Blackwood? Mr. Blackwood?" Her voice cracked with desperation.

The wail of approaching ambulance sirens pierced the air, growing louder with each passing second. Despite knowing help was near, Olivia's panic only intensified. Her breath hitched when her gaze landed on the gaping wound in his chest—a grotesque mess of torn flesh and dark, congealing blood. This was clearly the source of the crimson stains covering his body.

Tears blurred her vision, hot and unstoppable. Why had he thrown himself in harm's way for her? The question burned through her mind like acid.

In her frantic attempts to rouse him, Liam's mask had shifted, revealing the sharp line of his pale jaw. One more nudge and she'd see his entire face. A desperate curiosity clawed at her—she needed to know if her suspicions were correct.

But as her fingers hovered near the mask's edge, they trembled violently, as if repelled by some invisible force. She couldn't bring herself to do it.

Suddenly, paramedics swarmed around them, efficiently loading both Olivia and Liam onto separate stretchers. As they wheeled her away, the world spun violently, and darkness swallowed her whole.

When consciousness returned, Olivia was met with the sound of muffled sobs. Amelia Dawson, her assistant, sat hunched in a chair, tears streaming down her face. The moment she noticed Olivia stirring, she sprang forward. "Olivia! Thank God you're awake! I was so—so scared."

Though still weak, Olivia managed a small smile and found her strength returning faster than expected. "Even if I'd been in a coma, your crying would've woken me," she teased gently.

Amelia sniffled, wiping at her red-rimmed eyes. "I'm sorry. I just—I can't stop thinking about what could've happened."

Olivia reached out to squeeze her hand. "But it didn't. I'm here. That's what matters."

Amelia's story had always tugged at Olivia's heartstrings. They'd met overseas when Amelia was a brilliant but struggling student. After losing both parents in a tragic construction accident, the substantial compensation money had been stolen by her uncle's family.

Forced to live under their roof and rules, Amelia had fought tooth and nail for her education. Even after acing her college entrance exams, her relatives had planned to marry her off rather than pay tuition. So she'd stolen back what was rightfully hers and fled abroad, working multiple jobs while studying.

Olivia had first hired her as temporary holiday help at the auction house, but quickly recognized her potential. Soon, Amelia became her permanent assistant and, in many ways, the little sister Olivia never had—though one prone to emotional outbursts.

"It's all my fault," Amelia choked out suddenly. "I knew Victor was trouble, but I got careless. I didn't watch the car closely enough, and he sabotaged the brakes. You should fire me—I deserve it! If that stranger hadn't stepped in..." Her voice broke. "I've already called the police. Victor won't get away with this."

Olivia shook her head slowly. "The police won't help."

The unspoken truth hung heavy between them. Some battles couldn't be fought through legal channels. Not when dealing with the Blackwoods.
###Chapter 357

Olivia's mind remained sharp despite the medication, replaying the car accident frame by frame. A disturbing realization had crystallized in her thoughts. Victor must have orchestrated the incident, yet he wouldn't have been foolish enough to execute it personally. The police would inevitably trace whoever tampered with the brake lines - no mastermind would leave such obvious evidence.

Her fingers suddenly tightened around Amelia's wrist. "Amelia, you must go to the police station immediately. Withdraw the complaint. Tell them to close the investigation and classify it as an accident."

Amelia's eyes widened in shock. "Have you lost your mind? That man tried to murder you!"

A bitter smile twisted Olivia's lips. "Whether you believe it or not, the police won't touch Victor. Not really."

Bribing a scapegoat with substantial funds wasn't exactly challenging in their circles.

Understanding dawned on Amelia's face, but frustration still burned in her gaze. "I can't stomach letting him walk away unscathed."

Olivia's eyes turned glacial with determination. "We have all the time in the world, Amelia. Patience will serve us better." She adjusted her hospital gown. "Now, would you take me to see my rescuer?"

The car accident had left Olivia with minor injuries, and after receiving discharge instructions from the nurse, she was cleared to move about.

But as they reached the private ward's entrance, a figure blocked their path. "What do you think you're doing here?" Oliver Hart demanded, his body barricading the doorway, his glare piercing Olivia like she carried the plague. "Mr. Blackwood needs rest. If you actually care about him, you'll leave. Do you realize every encounter with you leaves him either injured or indebted? You're a walking catastrophe."

Amelia's temper flared instantly. With a derisive snort, she grabbed Oliver by his collar. "Move aside, you insolent brat!"

Oliver struggled against her grip, his face flushing crimson when he realized he couldn't break free from the trained bodyguard's hold. "You—! Get your hands off me before I make you regret it!"

Olivia remained silent, her gaze fixed on the closed door. After a weighted pause, she spoke quietly. "Amelia, let's go."

Reluctantly, Amelia released Oliver. As they turned to leave, she couldn't resist a parting shot. "Mr. Blackwood is a decent, composed man. You could learn something from him about controlling your temper. I can't fathom why he keeps an attack dog like you around."

Oliver's jaw clenched, fury vibrating through his words. "Don't test me. Just get out of here before I—"

"Oliver!" A voice called sharply from inside the room.

The assistant's bravado evaporated instantly. "Sir, I'm here." He cracked the door open just enough to slip inside.

Amelia snorted, whispering to Olivia, "Watch how the guard dog comes when his master calls."

Olivia sighed wearily. "Then why rise to his bait?"

Amelia ducked her head in contrition. "It won't happen again."
###Chapter 358

The door clicked shut behind Oliver Hart, his previously rigid posture now relaxed as he offered Olivia Sinclair a deep, apologetic bow. "My sincerest apologies for my earlier words. My master requests your presence for a private conversation."

Olivia gave a silent nod.

Amelia Dawson pushed the wheelchair forward, only to be blocked by Oliver at the threshold.

Clearing his throat, Oliver addressed Amelia directly. "The invitation extends only to Ms. Sinclair, I'm afraid."

Amelia exhaled sharply through her nose before stepping back. "Fine. I wouldn't waste my breath arguing with the likes of you anyway."

While their verbal sparring continued, Olivia expertly maneuvered her wheelchair past them and into the sterile hospital room.

The sight of the masked figure propped up in bed sent an unexpected pang through Olivia's chest. Even gravely injured, he refused to reveal his face.

Mr. Jack's eyes - the only visible feature through the mask's openings - held depths of calm wisdom.

"Olivia," he began, his voice steady as bedrock. "I can see the questions swirling behind your eyes. Today, I intend to answer them all."

Olivia's fingers curled into tight fists as she fought to steady her breathing. "Please," she managed, "I'm listening."

"First, I know you suspect I might be Liam."

His blunt acknowledgment hit like a physical blow. Olivia's eyes widened, her pulse thundering in her ears. Not only had he voiced her deepest suspicion, but he'd done so with unsettling certainty.

"You—" Her voice cracked. "Are you?"

"No." Mr. Jack's response came swift and final. A complex emotion flickered in his gaze as he held hers. "Because Liam Blackwood has been dead for years."

The words struck like a hammer blow. Olivia's vision swam as the room tilted dangerously. Her knuckles turned white gripping the wheelchair arms, her entire body trembling as if she might collapse at any moment.

Her lips moved soundlessly before she finally choked out, "That's impossible! How could Liam be dead?"

Mr. Jack sighed, the sound heavy with unspoken sorrow. "Believe what you will, but this is truth. With your auction houses spanning continents, you have resources I can only imagine. Send your people to investigate the underground markets in Valtierra. The answers await you there."

"Lies!" Olivia's control shattered like glass. Her chest heaved with ragged breaths, her entire body vibrating with denial. "He was fine when I last saw him! This can't be true!"

Mr. Jack winced as he adjusted his position against the pillows. "I understand this is difficult to accept. Perhaps we should continue this conversation after you've had time to process."

Olivia dragged in shuddering breaths, forcing herself to focus through the storm of emotions. Despite the years apart, memories of Liam remained vivid - his laughter, his touch, the way his eyes crinkled when he smiled.

The past refused to stay buried.

The present refused to make sense.

And the future...

The future suddenly seemed unbearably empty.
###Chapter 359

To claim Olivia felt no disappointment or resentment would be dishonest. Yet, despite everything, she couldn't deny the profound bond they had shared since childhood.

In her heart, Liam had always been her most cherished old friend. No matter what had transpired between them, she wanted him to live well.

The news of his death sent her mind spiraling into chaos.

After a long silence, Olivia finally spoke, her voice rough with emotion. "Continue."

Mr. Hart opened his eyes and studied her before going on. "I met him in the stock market. Since I was young, people avoided me because of my appearance. I had wealth, but he had nothing except brilliance. We understood each other instantly and took over the market together. With his help, we expanded our reach and founded multiple companies."

"There were too many businesses for me to handle alone, so he took charge. He worked relentlessly, like a machine that never needed rest."

"I considered him my brother. I even tried introducing him to women, but he refused. He never wanted to return to his homeland. The only person constantly by his side was Sebastian."

"Later, someone tried to kill me, and he gave his life to save mine. Before he died, he confessed there was one person he could never forget. So, after his death, I vowed to find you."

Olivia's lips parted, but no sound escaped. She lifted a hand to her face, her fingers brushing against the cold trails of her tears.

Her first reaction was disbelief. "That can't be true. Wasn't Evelyn the most important person to him?" she blurted.

Mr. Hart tilted his head, confusion flickering across his face. "Evelyn? I don't know who that is. But it doesn't matter. I'm a selfish man. Saving your life repays my debt to him. Remember our agreement. From now on, your fate is no concern of mine."

Olivia wanted to demand if he felt even a shred of guilt. But as the thought settled, she realized Liam's choices had been his own. She had no right to blame anyone else.

Her voice trembled as she replied, "I understand. Thank you for saving me, Mr. Hart."

With a dismissive wave, he signaled for her to leave.

As she reached the door, a sudden thought struck her. She paused and glanced back. "Liam never returned home because he was wronged and cast out. If you truly valued his kindness, you wouldn't let the current Winslow family live in comfort."

Mr. Hart's lips twisted into a mocking smile.

"Do you take me for a fool? After what happened to you, Oliver already investigated. The Winslows may be behind your recent troubles."

"I know there's bad blood between you. You're just trying to use me to settle your score, aren't you? I've repaid my debt by saving your life. Don't expect me to interfere on your behalf."

His condescending tone left Olivia seething. She had never intended to manipulate him.

###Chapter 360

Olivia's icy stare cut through the air as she muttered a clipped apology. "My apologies if I seemed harsh."

Without another word, she turned on her heel and strode out of the hospital room.

Behind her, Mr. Jack's gaze lingered on the empty doorway for a long moment before he finally looked away, exhaling a heavy sigh.

Instead of returning to her own room, Olivia went straight to the administration desk to finalize her discharge. Once the paperwork was settled, she pulled out her phone and dialed Victor.

When he answered, she didn’t waste time with pleasantries. "Victor, you have two options. Either hand Miranda over to me willingly, or I’ll have the authorities hunt her down."

A tense silence stretched between them before Victor finally spoke, his voice smooth and measured. "Olivia, I’m afraid I don’t follow. When I heard about your accident, I was genuinely concerned. I’m actually on my way to the hospital now. I understand why you might suspect me, but staging something so clumsy wouldn’t benefit me in the slightest. There must be some misunderstanding. If you’re upset, I’d like to make it right. After all, the accident happened shortly after our meeting, and I feel somewhat responsible."

Olivia wasn’t fooled for a second. A sardonic smile curved her lips as she replied, "I won’t repeat myself. The fact that I’m calling you means I already have enough proof. If you refuse to cooperate, I’ll take this straight to the Kensingtons. Since I returned to Eldermere, Donovan has been extremely protective of me. Just imagine his reaction when he finds out one of your lackeys nearly killed me in that so-called 'accident.'"

Ever since Olivia had been welcomed back into the Kensington family, Donovan had treated her like royalty, elevating her above everyone else. This wasn’t just common knowledge in Westhaven—even the elite circles of Crestwood were well aware of it. It was precisely this favoritism that had driven Miranda to act out of jealousy and desperation.

On the other end of the line, Victor’s composure cracked. She could hear him taking sharp, controlled breaths, struggling to regain his calm.

Then, faintly, Olivia caught the sound of a woman’s desperate plea. "Please, Mr. Blackwood! I’m begging you—don’t do this!"

"Silence!" Victor snarled, his voice laced with fury.

Realizing the call was still connected, he took a moment to steady himself before forcing a dry chuckle. "Thank you for the reminder, Olivia."

She smirked, knowing exactly what his response meant.

Miranda had been at Victor’s side for years, aiding him in countless schemes. She had foolishly believed herself indispensable. But in truth, she was nothing more than a pawn—one he was all too willing to sacrifice.

Victor wasn’t stupid. When faced with the choice between crossing the Kensingtons or abandoning Miranda, the decision was obvious.

What surprised Olivia was how quickly he had folded. She had expected a battle of wits, given that she didn’t actually have concrete evidence.

After returning home, Olivia allowed herself a moment of rest.

###Chapter 361

The afternoon sun cast golden streaks across Olivia Sinclair's office when Amelia Dawson rushed in with urgent news. "Our sources confirm the Blackwood family is making political maneuvers. Mrs. Beatrice Ellington is hosting a lavish birthday gala next week."

Amelia hesitated before continuing. "She's renowned for her passion for rare art. We've just secured that coveted Renaissance masterpiece—the one the Blackwoods have been desperate to acquire. Should we postpone tomorrow's auction?"

Olivia arched a perfectly sculpted brow, a slow smirk playing on her lips.

"Postpone? Absolutely not." She leaned forward, eyes gleaming with strategy. "We'll display it front and center. Let the whispers spread that Mrs. Ellington adores this piece. Make it impossible for the Blackwoods to resist."

Amelia nodded, already drafting the plan.

Despite her lingering injuries, Olivia insisted on attending the auction. As she adjusted her blazer, little Isabelle darted forward, tiny fingers clutching her sleeve.

"Mommy, stay home," Isabelle pleaded, her wide eyes shimmering with unshed tears. "You're still hurt."

Olivia's heart clenched. The accident had left deeper scars than physical ones—Isabelle now woke screaming from nightmares, terrified her mother would vanish.

Kneeling, Olivia cupped her daughter's face. "Sweetheart, I promise I'll be safe. Stay with Great-Grandfather, and when I return, we'll have that ice cream date, okay?"

Isabelle sniffled but finally released her grip. "If you break your promise, you owe me extra sprinkles."

Olivia laughed, pressing a kiss to her forehead before leaving.

At the auction house, she expected the VIP suite to be occupied—yet Sebastian Whitmore had reserved it exclusively for her.

"You didn't need to do this," Olivia remarked as he escorted her inside. "Profit over personal favors, Sebastian."

He offered a tired smile. "No one booked it today."

A lie. As they passed Suite No. 2, a woman's furious shrieks pierced the air—undoubtedly Sebastian's fiancée, displeased with his priorities.

Olivia studied his weary expression. "Take the day off. Smooth things over before she sets this place on fire."

Sebastian exhaled, rubbing his temples. "If only it were that simple."

The tension between them crackled—unspoken alliances, unfulfilled promises.

Olivia settled into the plush seating, her gaze fixed on the auction floor.

The game had begun.
###Chapter 362

Sebastian Whitmore's face clouded for a fleeting moment before he composed himself. "She understands how overwhelmed I am with responsibilities." His fingers tightened around the auction catalog. "And you seldom visit our Eldermere branch. I couldn't possibly leave your comfort to junior staff."

Olivia Sinclair saw right through his transparent excuse. A sharp pain bloomed behind her temples as she recognized his persistent devotion, despite her repeated rejections and his existing engagement.

"I'm not accepting any excuses," Olivia declared, her voice cutting through the tension. "Are you actually refusing a direct request from me?"

Sebastian swallowed hard, his Adam's apple bobbing. "I... appreciate your consideration," he finally managed.

With the auction's opening gong echoing through the hall, Sebastian exited Private Suite One, leaving Olivia alone with her swirling thoughts.

Through the slightly ajar door of Suite Two, Sebastian's fiancée caught the unmistakable sight of him emerging from Olivia's private room. Her manicured nails dug into her palms.

"I knew it," she hissed, her voice dripping with venom. "He reserved that suite specifically for that scheming witch."

Turning sharply to her butler, she demanded, "Have you located the person I instructed you to find?"

The butler bowed deeply. "All arrangements are complete, madam. By nightfall, that woman's social standing will be reduced to rubble."

A cruel smile twisted the fiancée's lips, momentarily transforming her delicate features.

"Excellent work. Continue serving me faithfully after my marriage into the Whitmore family, and you'll find yourself handsomely rewarded."

The butler practically vibrated with excitement as he nodded vigorously.

The auction commenced with modest opening bids for the initial lots. The room hummed with restrained energy as seasoned collectors concealed their true intentions behind polite smiles.

Sebastian had strategically placed the Blackwood family directly across from Olivia's suite. From her vantage point, Olivia had an unobstructed view into Suite Four.

The occupant surprised her - Catherine Winslow, still clinging to the Blackwood family after all these years. Catherine's lavish attire suggested prosperity, but Olivia's brow furrowed at the noticeable absence of Richard.

Before long, Catherine grew visibly restless. She turned sharply to her companion.

"What kind of establishment is this?" she snapped. "You assured me this was Crestwood's premier auction house. These offerings are pedestrian at best. Are you certain this is where my desired item will appear?"

Her companion shifted uncomfortably. "The information came from Valtierra's most reliable underground source. There can't be any mistake."

With no alternative, Catherine settled back into her seat, though her tapping foot betrayed her impatience.

These days, the Blackwood empire existed solely under Victor's iron grip. Richard had become little more than a figurehead, stripped of all meaningful authority. Catherine's position had never been more precarious.
###Chapter 363

Whispers slithered through high society about Miranda Graves' mysterious vanishing. Such occurrences were unthinkable in their gilded world. Catherine Winslow knew in her bones that Victor Blackwood orchestrated Miranda's disappearance. After all those years of loyalty, this was Miranda's reward? The sheer cruelty of it made Catherine's blood run cold.

Her fingers trembled as she clutched the auction catalog tighter. She would secure that painting at any cost - the one rumored to resemble Beatrice Ellington's likeness. Eighty million should suffice, she calculated.

When the painting finally appeared as the auction's grand finale, Catherine didn't blink.

"Fifty million!" Her voice cut through the hushed room like a blade.

She sat straighter, chin lifted in triumph. Surely no one would challenge such an extravagant opening bid. Who else would throw away fortunes on mere canvas and oil?

Her confidence shattered within seconds.

The auction erupted into chaos. Bids flew faster than Catherine could track, each voice more determined than the last. The numbers climbed with terrifying speed - sixty million, seventy, then eighty-five in dizzying succession.

Catherine's nails bit into her palms. This couldn't be happening. She'd budgeted precisely eighty million, not a penny more. The painting's modest eight-million starting price now seemed laughable. Were these people insane?

The servant at her elbow leaned close, panic threading through her whisper. "Madam, someone must have leaked about Mrs. Ellington's connection to the painting. Everyone here knows."

"What?" Catherine shot to her feet, the room spinning around her. The servant steadied her with a tentative hand.

"Perhaps another buyer spread the information deliberately."

"Idiot!" Catherine's palm cracked across the woman's cheek. "You had one job! Why didn't you bribe them properly?"

The servant cradled her reddening face. "Madam, the funds you provided barely covered the auction reserve. There was nothing left for additional... incentives."

"Where's that useless Richard? Didn't you squeeze money from him?"

The servant recoiled as if struck again. "Madam, I... I couldn't possibly approach Mr. Winslow again. You know what happened last time-"

Catherine's second slap cut off the pathetic excuse. She collapsed back into her seat, temples pounding as she watched her prize slip through her fingers. The auctioneer's gavel hovered like an executioner's blade.
###Chapter 364

The tension in the auction hall was palpable as Catherine Winslow adjusted her pearl necklace with trembling fingers. "Go inform those bidders immediately," she commanded her assistant through gritted teeth. "Make it clear this painting belongs to the Winslow family heritage. Anyone who dares challenge us will face consequences."

Her assistant hesitated, biting her lower lip. But under Catherine's withering glare, she hurried out of the private booth.

The Winslow name still carried weight in Eldermere's high society. Though their influence had waned in recent years, most bidders immediately withdrew upon hearing the family's claim. No one wanted to make enemies of the once-powerful Winslow dynasty.

Just as Catherine allowed herself a smug smile, a crystal-clear voice sliced through the murmuring crowd. "The Winslows? How quaint. And what if I choose to ignore your little demand?"

Catherine's head snapped toward the source - the prestigious No. 1 private suite. Her perfectly manicured nails dug into her palms. Of course the elite suite would be interested in Beatrice Ellington's portrait. The rumors about its significance must have spread further than she anticipated.

Having frequented this auction house for years, Catherine knew the unspoken rules. Even as a Winslow, she'd never been granted access to the No. 1 suite. Director Sebastian Whitmore made it clear - the Winslows no longer held that level of prestige.

Her assistant returned, face flushed with indignation. "How dare they speak to the Winslows like that! Shall we confront them directly, Madam?"

"Silence!" Catherine hissed, though her own frustration burned just as hot. "We can't afford to antagonize whoever's in that suite. But surely they should show basic respect to an established Eldermere family."

Steeling herself, Catherine emerged from her booth with practiced grace. Approaching the velvet ropes cordoning off the elite area, she adopted her most diplomatic tone. "Good evening. I'm Catherine Winslow. Might I know whom I have the pleasure of addressing? I've no wish to compete, but this particular painting holds sentimental value for our family. Name your price - the Winslows always repay their debts."

The suite remained ominously silent. Whispers rippled through the crowd. "The Winslows bowing to someone? Unthinkable!"

"Must be the Sinclair family. Or perhaps the Montgomerys?"

"Don't be absurd! Even combined, they wouldn't command this level of deference. This is someone far more powerful."

Still, no response came from behind the gilded doors. The auctioneer's hammer hovered mid-air.

Catherine's palms grew damp. Her assistant whispered nervously, "Shall we increase our bid, Madam?"

"With what funds, you imbecile?" Catherine snapped, her composure cracking. "Do you want the family accountants auditing my accounts?"

A new bid rang out from the silent suite. "One hundred million."

Catherine's knees nearly buckled. She gripped her assistant's arm for support. The room spun around her. "Madness!" she thought. "A hundred million for a single painting!"

The gavel fell with finality.

In that moment, Catherine Winslow realized two things: someone in that suite possessed unimaginable wealth, and they'd just humiliated the Winslow family before all of Eldermere's elite.
###Chapter 365

Olivia Sinclair was now certain the occupants of the No. 1 private room would never let her have the painting. The way they kept outbidding her felt deliberately cruel. As she calculated her dwindling funds, the urge to withdraw from the auction grew stronger.

Just as Olivia was about to concede defeat, the door to the No. 2 private room burst open. Evelyn Hartley rushed out and seized Olivia's wrist with surprising force.

"Don't surrender yet!" Evelyn hissed. "That whore in there only got access by sleeping with my fiancé. She's bluffing - I know for a fact she can't afford these bids."

Olivia studied Evelyn's manic expression with suspicion. "Evelyn? What are you doing here?"

Evelyn tossed her hair defiantly. "As I said, the auction director is my fiancé, and that slut in the No. 1 room has bewitched him. She manipulated her way into that VIP section - it's reserved for actual elites, not gold-digging tramps."

The crowd erupted in murmurs. Evelyn's explanation made disturbing sense. The No. 1 room had sat empty for months, only accessible to true power players. Its sudden occupancy tonight had raised eyebrows.

Olivia's expression remained skeptical. "Evelyn, these are dangerous accusations."

Evelyn's smile turned razor-sharp. "I'm simply warning you as a professional courtesy. I came tonight to expose this homewrecker. Since she dared steal my man, I'll ruin her reputation completely." She pulled out her phone, fingers flying across the screen. "We've collaborated before, Olivia. Take my advice or don't - your choice."

Within moments, Evelyn had launched a live stream that instantly attracted thousands of viewers. Her caption screamed: "LIVE CONFRONTATION: Watch me expose the slut trying to steal my fiancé!"

Even non-followers flooded in at the scandalous promise.

Once her audience reached critical mass, Evelyn's eyes welled with perfect, practiced tears. Her acting skills had always been her strongest asset - she could summon genuine-looking emotion on command.

Between dramatic sobs, Evelyn spun a tale of meeting Sebastian Whitmore, their whirlwind romance, and the "scheming seductress" who'd set her sights on him. Her butler Nathaniel chimed in at key moments, adding fabricated details that made the mystery woman sound increasingly monstrous.

Together, they whipped the online mob into a frenzy of righteous indignation.

When Evelyn sensed the outrage had peaked, she dabbed her eyes delicately. "Honestly, I don't want to hurt her. I just want to confront her directly. All I ask is that she leaves Sebastian alone and stops this disgusting behavior. If she apologizes sincerely, I'll even forgive her."

Her viewers flooded the chat with praise for Evelyn's "generosity," demanding harsher consequences for the "shameless homewrecker."

Meanwhile, inside the No. 1 private room, Olivia had just finished reviewing the documents Mr. Liam sent. Her investment expertise made the financial discrepancies obvious, but the solutions remained frustratingly elusive.

Gritting her teeth, Olivia mentally cursed Liam Blackwood for dumping this mess on her. Only when she removed her earpiece did the commotion outside register.

"What's happening?" Olivia frowned, turning to Amelia. "Has the auction concluded?"
###Chapter 366

Olivia Sinclair looked just as bewildered. "Not yet. I merely stepped outside to investigate. Apparently, some woman has started broadcasting live, ranting about a shameless homewrecker who seduced her fiancé. And guess what? This so-called mistress is supposedly attending today's auction."

Amelia Dawson gasped. "A mistress scandal at our auction house? Is this woman deliberately trying to cause a scene?"

Amelia shook her head. "I'm not certain. The stream is still ongoing. Should I have security remove them? By the way, you'll recognize the streamer - Evelyn Hartley, Sebastian Whitmore's fiancée. The same one who commandeered the VIP suite without reservation last time. I wasn't sure how to handle this without interrupting your document review earlier."

Olivia hesitated, biting back her initial response. So it was Sebastian's troublesome fiancée again. Any mishandling could be perceived as mistreating an employee's family.

"Sebastian took personal leave today, correct? Summon him immediately. This is his domestic issue to resolve. He gets thirty minutes. If unresolved, eject his fiancée immediately. And Sebastian will answer for this disruption. My auction house isn't some soap opera set."

Amelia nodded sharply. "Understood."

As Amelia reached for the door handle, it burst open. Evelyn Hartley stormed in flanked by her butler and an entourage of bodyguards, trailed by gawking spectators.

Evelyn immediately began snapping photos with her phone before focusing the camera on Olivia's obscured figure behind the privacy screen. Neither woman could see the other's face clearly.

Evelyn sneered. "Too ashamed to show your face, homewrecker? Weren't you proud enough stealing my fiancé? Don't you know Sebastian Whitmore belongs to me?"

Olivia needed a moment to process the absurd accusation. Since when had she become some scheming mistress? Sebastian was merely her subordinate. What nonsense was this?

Evelyn continued her tirade. "Come out now, kneel, and beg my forgiveness! Swear never to approach Sebastian again, and I might let this slide!"

Olivia's voice turned arctic. "Miss Hartley, you're gravely mistaken about my relationship with your fiancé."

Evelyn exploded. "You're on first-name basis with him! He reserved our best suite for you, bought you gifts! Stop pretending! Or are you actually proud of stealing another woman's man?"

Olivia's brow furrowed at the outrageous claims.

The growing crowd, riled up by Evelyn, began jeering.

"Miss Hartley, don't hold back! Teach that homewrecker a lesson!"

"I can't stand women who prey on taken men! Let's see this tramp's face!"

"Still playing innocent! Probably waiting for Sebastian to rescue her like some damsel!"

Amelia's expression darkened with fury. "Enough!" she roared.
###Chapter 367

Amelia's years of service under Olivia had honed her skills in intimidation to perfection. Her commanding tone instantly hushed the murmuring crowd.

"You dare spread such ridiculous lies?" Amelia's voice shook with barely contained rage. "Do you even comprehend who you're accusing? This is a Kensington heir you're speaking to. Every brick of this auction house belongs to her."

She took a threatening step forward. "Sebastian Whitmore answers to her. Is there any issue with him reserving the finest private room for his employer? Let me enlighten you, Evelyn."

Amelia's glare could have frozen lava. "Lady Olivia showed you mercy when you illegally occupied the premier suite last time, only to spare Sebastian embarrassment. Who granted you the right to play the righteous accuser here?"

Evelyn blinked in shock before her lips curled into a sneer. "You'll need to fabricate a more believable tale next time! The Kensingtons, you say? Don't tell me this cripple is Olivia Sinclair? Preposterous! I've met Olivia before."

Her laugh rang hollow. "She was just a mute little thing. Last I heard, her own family disowned her after she returned. How could trash like her possibly own this establishment? This performance is laughable."

Her entourage erupted in mocking laughter.

Olivia finally recognized that shrill voice. No wonder the accusations had sounded familiar - it was her old nemesis.

"Evelyn," Olivia said calmly, maneuvering her wheelchair forward. Though her legs had nearly healed, doctors insisted on limited movement for proper recovery.

Recognition flashed across Evelyn's face, quickly replaced by a storm of emotions - resentment, jealousy, and pure malice twisting her features.

"Years pass but you remain unchanged," Evelyn spat. "Still stealing other women's fiancés, I see?" Her gaze dropped to Olivia's legs, lips curling in satisfaction. "Rumors said the Kensingtons threw you out. I see they broke your legs first."

She barked a laugh. "What fantasy world lets you think Sebastian would marry trash like you? Delusional!"

Olivia didn't engage. Instead, she motioned to Amelia. "Remove Evelyn from the premises. And inform security that from today, neither stray dogs nor Evelyn Hartley are permitted in any of my establishments."

She'd never imagined Sebastian's fiancée would be Evelyn. The vast disparity between the Hartleys and Whitmores made his choice baffling.

While Olivia appreciated Sebastian's management skills, she wouldn't tolerate Evelyn's theatrics indefinitely for his sake.

Some debts could never be forgiven. The humiliations Evelyn had inflicted still burned fresh in Olivia's memory.

"You recovered your voice, how fortunate!" Evelyn shrieked, face purpling with rage. "But you're still gutter trash with no manners! How dare you claim ownership here? Since when did you take up acting?"

She jabbed a finger toward Olivia. "No one dares evict me! I'm Sebastian's rightful fiancée, while you're just a shameless mistress! You're the one who belongs in the streets!"

Meanwhile, Evelyn's live stream exploded with vitriolic comments:

"Ugh, Olivia makes me sick! Acting all high and mighty when she's just riding Sebastian's coattails!"

###Chapter 368

The whispers in the room grew louder, sharp and venomous.

"I heard Sebastian Whitmore is close with Evelyn Hartley. How dare Olivia Sinclair act so shamelessly!"

"If I were Sebastian, I’d never choose Olivia. Can’t this homewrecker just vanish? That smug look on her face makes me sick!"

Evelyn smirked, gesturing for the butler to recite every insult hurled at Olivia, enunciating each word with deliberate cruelty.

Olivia remained still, her expression unreadable, her fingers tightening imperceptibly on the arms of her wheelchair.

Evelyn’s smirk faltered when she failed to provoke a reaction. "Did you hear that? You’re nothing but a despised mistress, hated by everyone!"

Turning to the crowd, Evelyn raised her voice. "Everyone, thank you for standing with me today. Help me teach this woman a lesson, and both the Hartley and Whitmore families will remember your loyalty."

The room erupted. The Hartleys were influential, but the Whitmores? They were old money, a dynasty that commanded respect across Crestwood. Even if they weren’t as visible in high society now, their name still carried weight.

Amelia Dawson paled. "What are you doing? Are you seriously considering violence?"

She fumbled for her phone, but Evelyn was faster. She lunged forward, gripping Amelia’s wrist with bruising force.

The butler seized the moment, shouting, "What are you waiting for? Teach that woman a lesson she won’t forget!"

Olivia’s face drained of color. She hadn’t expected Evelyn to be this reckless. The room erupted into chaos.

Despite the bodyguards Olivia had brought, they were quickly overwhelmed by the sheer number of people surging forward.

Someone grabbed Olivia’s hair, yanking hard enough to make her gasp. She was dragged from her wheelchair, her injured legs making it impossible to regain her footing.

But Olivia wasn’t defenseless. Years of training kicked in. Even on the ground, she twisted, disarming two attackers before another blow sent her reeling.

The private room had no cameras—a measure meant to protect guests’ privacy—but now it only ensured there would be no evidence of what was happening.

The mob acted for different reasons. Some genuinely believed Evelyn’s lies. Others simply despised mistresses and didn’t care for the truth. And some? They just wanted an excuse to unleash their cruelty.

Evelyn’s promise of favor from the Whitmores was all the encouragement they needed.

Amelia broke free, throwing herself over Olivia, taking several brutal hits meant for her. Trembling, she whispered, "Olivia, run. They took my phone. I can’t call for help."

Olivia’s jaw clenched, fury burning beneath her icy composure. With Amelia’s help, they inched toward the door—

But the crowd wasn’t done yet.

The door loomed ahead, so close yet impossibly far.

And then—

A shadow fell across the threshold.

A voice, cold and commanding, cut through the chaos.

"Enough."
###Chapter 369

A shrill voice pierced through the crowd. "That homewrecker is trying to escape!" The murmuring mass immediately turned their attention toward the exit, surging forward like a tidal wave.

Evelyn's lips curled into a venomous smirk. "Let's strip this shameless woman naked and expose her to the world!" she declared with malicious glee. "That'll teach her not to seduce other women's fiancés."

Her words ignited the mob's bloodlust. Dozens of predatory eyes locked onto Olivia with frightening intensity. The crowd's morality had been easily swayed by Evelyn's poisonous words.

Olivia's limbs turned to ice. Realizing escape was impossible, she shoved Amelia away urgently. "Run and call the police!" she commanded. "Leave me here. My injured leg will only slow you down. Getting help is more important than both of us being trapped."

As Olivia spoke, rough hands grabbed her wrists while others seized her arms with bruising force.

Amelia's eyes widened in terror before she finally managed to slip through the crowd. Olivia was right - dragging her injured boss would only doom them both.

Olivia struggled futilely against the grasping hands. Just as someone's fingers hooked into her blouse collar, a powerful figure charged through the crowd with a thunderous kick. "Enough!" Sebastian's voice boomed across the room.

Silence fell instantly.

Tears streaked down Olivia's face as she stood frozen in shock. Sebastian's furious gaze swept across the crowd before landing on Evelyn, who had been hiding behind her minions.

Evelyn paled when she saw Sebastian arrive with his security team. Biting her lip, she stepped forward with practiced distress. "Sebastian, tell me honestly," she pleaded. "Did this woman seduce you first? What's so special about her? She's nothing but a lying homewrecker who preys on engaged men. Don't let her deceive you."

Sebastian took a measured breath. "Did you organize this mob?" he demanded.

"Not exactly," Evelyn hedged. "People were simply outraged by her shameless behavior. She deserves this public humiliation."

The head butler, eager to curry favor, chimed in. "Mr. Whitmore, we're doing this for you and your fiancée. With your wedding approaching, we can't allow scandals. This shameless woman has caused Miss Hartley so much distress she's lost weight from crying every night."

Evelyn nodded dramatically, perfecting her victim act.

Olivia straightened her posture and fixed Evelyn with an icy stare. "Sebastian," she said coldly. "Tell them who I really am."

Sebastian's fists clenched, his fury directed entirely at Evelyn. "Olivia is not a homewrecker. There is no inappropriate relationship between us. She owns this auction house - I'm merely the director because she appointed me. Evelyn, are you trying to get yourself blacklisted from every high society event?"

Evelyn's eyes bulged. "What nonsense!" she shrieked. "You're the Whitmore heir! Why would you need employment from Olivia? Everyone knows the Kensingtons barely tolerate her! How could someone like her possibly own such a prestigious auction house?"

Sebastian's frown deepened dangerously. "Whether Olivia is favored by her family has no bearing on her business acumen. Evelyn, Olivia was willing to overlook your previous transgressions. But today you crossed a line even I won't defend."

Evelyn trembled with rage, but her voice dripped with false bravado. "What exactly can she do to me? A nobody like Olivia is powerless against my family! Sebastian, you're my fiancé! You promised to marry me - swore I was the only woman you'd ever wed!"
###Chapter 370

Sebastian's lips trembled slightly, as if struggling to form words of protest, but he swallowed them back with visible effort. His eyes squeezed shut, revealing deep anguish.

Olivia sensed something unusual. Did Evelyn have some hold over Sebastian? But that hardly mattered now.

The instigators had scattered like frightened mice at Sebastian's arrival. Evelyn's entourage now stood subdued under the watchful eyes of Sebastian's security team.

With a subtle gesture from Olivia, guards moved to restrain Evelyn. "Sebastian speaks truth. His protection won't shield you this time, Evelyn. The debt between us runs deep - did you truly believe I'd let your transgressions go unanswered? Did you imagine I wouldn't retaliate when you came hunting for me?"

Evelyn thrashed against her captors, eyes darting wildly with barely concealed panic. She raised her voice in desperate defiance, "Who do you think you are, Olivia Sinclair? You'll never surpass me! You're still the same worthless trash you've always been!"

Amelia rushed back into the room, cheeks flushed with outrage. "Olivia, she's unbearable!"

A glacial edge entered Olivia's voice. "Then ensure we never hear from her again. The noise offends me."

Evelyn's knees buckled as the color drained from her face. The guards dragged her away, her fading curses echoing down the corridor long after she disappeared from view.

Silence reclaimed the private chamber. Olivia gingerly touched her wounds, shadows of pain darkening her eyes.

Sebastian dropped to his knees before her, handsome features twisted in remorse. "This is my failure, Olivia. All of it. Berate me as you will. How could I have been so blind? To let you suffer like this... Had I arrived moments later..." His voice broke as he struck his own chest in self-recrimination. "Sebastian—" Olivia caught his wrist mid-motion.

Their eyes met - his filled with torment, hers with quiet understanding.

"I bear you no malice. As I've said before, you could have lived comfortably as the Whitmore heir. Your dedication to the auction house is undeniable. Without you, it would never have become Eldermere's premier establishment. For that, you have my gratitude."

Her tone shifted abruptly, turning arctic. "But today we settle accounts. I cannot comprehend your attachment to Evelyn. As you've witnessed, our conflict admits no reconciliation."

"You must choose - Evelyn or the auction house. Should you depart, you'll receive a generous severance."

Sebastian's eyes flickered, his throat working soundlessly. The decision was clear, yet speaking it proved unbearable.

He bowed his head, avoiding Olivia's piercing gaze. "I cannot break my engagement. Forgive me."

Olivia released his wrist. Not angry, merely perplexed. What hidden strings did Evelyn pull? Sebastian was no fool - he must have uncovered Evelyn's true nature. Since he refused to explain, Olivia wouldn't press.

"Then assist me in selecting a new director. This changes nothing between us personally, Sebastian." Her voice turned steely. "But know this - Evelyn won't escape consequences this time."
###Chapter 371

Olivia didn’t return home immediately, worried her daughter might see her in this state and grow concerned. The car transporting Evelyn arrived first. Even now, Evelyn was still hurling curses.

Amelia, standing beside Olivia, clenched her fists in anger. "Still so arrogant! Olivia, should I teach her a lesson?"

"No." Olivia’s lips curved into a cold smile as she watched another car approach. "Let someone else handle Evelyn. The show is just beginning."

The second car rolled to a stop, and Miranda stepped out, her face pale. The moment she exited, her hands were restrained, and she was dragged before Olivia like a criminal.

"You—Olivia!" Hatred burned in Miranda’s eyes.

"Long time no see." Olivia’s smile widened. "Though I never imagined our reunion would be under such circumstances."

"You conniving witch! What did you do to Victor? Did you threaten him? There’s no way he’d abandon me like this!" Miranda spat.

Olivia wasn’t surprised by Miranda’s outburst. She had prepared for this. Without a word, she played the recorded phone call.

Miranda’s face drained of color as she listened to Victor’s cold, indifferent voice, betraying her without hesitation.

A bitter laugh escaped her lips before tears welled in her eyes. "Five years… Five years of loyalty, and this is how you repay me, Victor? You know Olivia despises me, yet you handed me over to her anyway. How heartless can you be?"

Olivia had no interest in Miranda’s self-pity. She turned to Amelia. "Lock Miranda and Evelyn in the same room. Keep them under strict surveillance. No food or water until the day after tomorrow."

Amelia frowned. "Olivia, Evelyn is vicious. She even tried to attack you earlier—"

"Amelia." Olivia’s sharp tone cut her off, displeasure flashing in her eyes. "Evelyn’s actions were despicable, but we won’t stoop to her level. There are better ways to punish her."

Amelia lowered her head, guilt flickering across her face. "You’re right. I wasn’t thinking clearly."

Olivia massaged her temples. "Just make sure they’re uncomfortable. And hurry—we have guests arriving soon."

Evelyn had screamed herself hoarse during the ride. By the time she was shoved into the empty room, she was exhausted. "Bitch!" she muttered weakly, kicking the door in frustration.

When she turned around, she froze. Someone was crouched in the corner. Recognition flickered in her eyes.

"Aren’t you Miranda?" Surprise gave way to a slow, calculating smile. "So I’m not the only one Olivia locked up. Good. Once we’re out, we’ll make sure she pays. The Hartleys might not be as powerful as the Kensingtons, but Olivia wouldn’t dare commit a crime in Eldermere."

Miranda had no intention of speaking, but Evelyn’s arrogance forced a mocking laugh from her. "Wouldn’t she? You’ve hurt her before. She won’t kill us, but she won’t make it easy either. Olivia never forgives her enemies."

Evelyn’s confidence wavered. Olivia had changed—her ruthlessness was new, and it unsettled her.

Meanwhile, Olivia had just arrived home when a servant hurried over. "Ma’am, your guest has arrived."

Amelia’s eyes widened as she turned to Olivia. "How did you know they’d come today?"

Olivia merely smiled.

###Chapter 372

Olivia simply smiled and motioned for the maid to prepare refreshments.

In the grand parlor, Catherine had been waiting with her daughter Lillian Winslow for over an hour. Olivia only made her appearance when Catherine's patience had completely worn thin.

This time, Olivia deliberately chose not to use a wheelchair. With Amelia's support, she walked slowly into the sitting room, each step measured and deliberate.

Olivia's lips curved into a frosty smile as she addressed Catherine. "My apologies for the delay. I became completely absorbed in my physical therapy session and quite forgot you were here."

Catherine forced a smile that didn't reach her eyes, her expression as transparent as glass. She moved to Olivia's side, replacing Amelia's supporting arm with her own.

"Olivia, I came to see how your leg is healing. I was absolutely thrilled to hear of your return from overseas. Ever since learning about your injury, I've been meaning to visit."

"Yet I only gathered the courage today. Given our... complicated history when we were family, I feared you might look down on me now that you're a Kensington."

Olivia nodded with a knowing glint in her eyes. "How thoughtful of you to consider that. Since rejoining the Kensington family, my grandfather has repeatedly advised me to let go of past grievances. He says some people simply aren't worth the mental energy."

Catherine's smile cracked like thin ice, her carefully constructed facade crumbling. Fury bubbled beneath her carefully composed surface, but she dared not show it. She hadn't expected Olivia to be so brutally direct, slicing through social niceties with surgical precision.

But then again, Catherine realized bitterly, Olivia had every right to be blunt. Whether the Kensingtons truly valued Olivia or not was irrelevant - what mattered was the staggering fortune she now controlled, the kind that commanded respect and fear in equal measure.

Who could have imagined that the timid girl who once lived as the Winslows' adopted daughter would now own an international chain of auction houses? Particularly her establishments in Eldermere and Westhaven had become the most prestigious, attracting elite collectors like bees to honey.

In essence, Olivia now possessed a network of connections most could only fantasize about. Crossing her at this point would require either monumental stupidity or willful ignorance.

Catherine understood this all too well, so she swallowed her pride like bitter medicine, careful not to provoke the lioness.

After helping Olivia settle onto the sofa, Catherine dramatically dropped to her knees. She pulled Lillian down beside her, and mother and daughter began weeping in perfect harmony, their tears forming a pitiful symphony.

Catherine looked particularly wretched as she performed her act. Between sobs, she pleaded, "Olivia, you have a child of your own now, don't you? I know I've wronged you countless times, but like you, I'm only fighting for my daughter's future. Please let me have the painting, or Lillian and I will be cast out into the streets. I'll do anything - anything at all - to make amends. Just name your price and let me take the painting. Please, consider my desperate situation."

Olivia looked down at the kneeling woman, her smirk barely concealed. She saw right through Catherine's attempt at emotional blackmail. Unfortunately for Catherine, this particular tactic wouldn't work.

After what felt like an eternity of crocodile tears, Olivia finally spoke, her voice dripping with deliberate calm. "You know what I remember most clearly? How you nearly cost me my unborn child. Tell me, Catherine - what could you possibly do to make up for that?"

Catherine's tears dried instantly. The air grew thick with tension, an uncomfortable silence stretching between them.

###Chapter 373

Olivia's jaw clenched as she pinched her own arm hard.

Wincing from the self-inflicted pain, Olivia gestured for Lillian to play along, forcing a pitiful expression. Without hesitation, Lillian bowed to Olivia, her lips trembling downward.

Truth be told, this display softened Olivia's heart. She estimated Lillian to be barely four years old. Yet the child appeared smaller than average, with wide, fearful eyes that darted nervously around the room.

Ever since Isabelle had entered her life, Olivia found it difficult to remain stern with young girls. After pressing her lips together for a long moment, she finally exhaled softly. "I'll give you what you want, but there's a price."

"Deal! Thank you!" Catherine beamed, nodding enthusiastically before adding shamelessly, "Since you're being so generous, I know you've forgiven us. Even though you and Liam are divorced, I still consider you part of the Blackwood family. That painting means everything to me. Remember, if you ever need help in Crestwood, just say the word. The Blackwoods will always support you!"

Olivia barely suppressed a cold smile, motioning instead for a bodyguard to retrieve the painting's case. Catherine accepted it gleefully and left without paying a cent.

Amelia frowned slightly. "Olivia, why did you just hand it over? You can't possibly believe that woman?"

Rubbing her temples, Olivia replied, "I don't trust a single word she says, and the Blackwoods couldn't support a feather in the wind."

"But—" Amelia hesitated.

Olivia offered a reassuring smile. "Don't worry. I didn't charge her because she'll pay in other ways."

"Now that she's accepted the painting, she's committed to my terms. Remember the plan I outlined for you?"

"Yes. I'll execute it immediately," Amelia nodded. Olivia waved her off dismissively.

As Amelia exited the villa, the butler rushed in breathlessly. Seeing his panicked expression, Olivia's stomach dropped.

"What's wrong? Is Isabelle alright at kindergarten?" Olivia, having decided to settle in Eldermere temporarily, had enrolled Isabelle in a local preschool. Today was supposed to be her first day.

Originally, Olivia had planned to take Isabelle herself, but unexpected circumstances had interfered. Alistair had volunteered instead. Still concerned, Olivia had instructed the butler to ensure a security detail accompanied them.

The butler mopped his brow, about to speak when Isabelle burst into the room in tears.

"Mommy, it's all my fault! I lost Great-grandpa!" Isabelle sobbed.

Olivia's breath caught, her voice tight with worry. "What happened?"

Isabelle's cries intensified. "Great-grandpa disappeared when I came out of school! I couldn't find him anywhere! It's all my fault!"
###Chapter 374

Olivia nearly stumbled, her vision swimming as her legs threatened to give way beneath her.

Alfred wrung his hands in distress. "Miss Sinclair, this is entirely my fault. I should have watched Mr. Kensington more carefully. Even with all the security personnel around, he vanished without a trace."

"One moment he was there, the next - gone. We've turned the estate upside down but found nothing. I came straight to inform you while the search continues. Please remain calm. Mr. Kensington couldn't have gone far. We'll locate him soon."

A cold numbness spread through Olivia's body, her inner turmoil threatening to surface. She'd been foolish to think she could protect Alistair alone. The bitter truth was she couldn't protect anyone now. How would she face Donovan if he learned what happened?

The sound of Isabelle's sobbing snapped Olivia from her spiraling thoughts. Kneeling, she gathered the trembling child into her arms. "This isn't your fault, sweetheart. It's mine. If I'd taken you to preschool today, none of this would have happened. Go rest now. I promise we'll find Great-grandpa Alistair."

Turning to the elderly butler, Olivia continued, "Alfred, you've served the Kensingtons for decades. You could have retired years ago, but your devotion kept you here. I'm truly grateful. Don't blame yourself - this is my responsibility."

Tears glistened in Alfred's eyes. "Mr. Kensington has always treated me like family. And yet I failed in this simple duty."

When the butler raised a hand to strike himself in anguish, Olivia caught his wrist firmly. "Alfred, we need you sharp and focused right now. Remember when Alistair wandered off to Eldermere during one of his episodes? It took Donovan weeks to find him then. We'll find him again. Now think - where would he most likely go? You know him better than anyone."

Wiping his eyes, Alfred quickly suggested several locations. Olivia and her team searched through the night but found nothing.

After twenty-four fruitless hours, Olivia filed a missing persons report with the police, providing detailed descriptions of Alistair's appearance, clothing, and last known whereabouts.

She also hired a specialized private investigation firm, instructing firmly: "Spare no expense. Use whatever resources necessary to bring him home."

Still, no leads emerged.

The professional search team offered their analysis: "An elderly gentleman couldn't have traveled far on foot in this timeframe. Even using public transportation, there would be traces. Our assessment suggests he may have been taken. Identifying the perpetrators will require police involvement. Ms. Sinclair, we've exhausted all options."

Olivia's knees nearly buckled. She bit her tongue hard, using the sharp pain to ground herself. Heartbreak threatened to overwhelm her, but she couldn't afford to lose control now. She needed to remain composed.

Handing the team leader an envelope, Olivia's voice turned steely. "Continue the search. Money is no object. But understand this - my grandfather's disappearance remains confidential. I've impressed this upon my staff. If word leaks, I'll hold each of you personally accountable."
###Chapter 375

Olivia's eyes turned icy. "I have both the funds to pay for your services and the means to protect my interests. Are we clear?"

The man paled instantly. "Yes," he stammered, nodding frantically before clutching the money and scurrying away.

Exhausted, Olivia collapsed onto the sofa.

Amelia returned after completing her tasks, her heart aching at Olivia's distress. "Olivia, I know you're worried, but if you fall apart, Isabelle will sense something is wrong," she said gently.

Olivia drew in a sharp breath. "You're right. But how can I stay calm when Alistair is missing and we have no leads?"

Amelia slid an envelope across the desk toward her. "Take a look at this first. And please, try to rest."

Frowning slightly, Olivia picked up the envelope and opened it. Inside was an invitation—from the Ellington family, requesting her presence.

Confusion flickered across her face.

"Why would the Ellingtons invite me?"

During her time with the Blackwoods, Olivia had deliberately kept her distance from the Ellingtons. Now, out of nowhere, they wanted her at their banquet.

Seeing her hesitation, Amelia offered, "Olivia, if you're uncomfortable, I can decline on your behalf. The messenger is still waiting outside."

Olivia shook her head, studying the invitation closely. Her finger traced the embossed emblem. "Look at this—this symbol marks it as a VIP invitation. Whatever their motives, sending this personally means they're serious."

A faint smirk curled her lips. "It's fine. I'm curious to see how Catherine will react when I show up unannounced."

Amelia nodded. "Understood."

Just then, Olivia's phone rang insistently. Sebastian's name flashed on the screen. The line was silent until Olivia, impatient, broke it. "Sebastian, I'm busy. If you have nothing to say, I'm hanging up."

"Olivia, wait!" His voice was rushed, laced with urgency.

"I'm calling about Evelyn. If this angers you, take it out on me—I won't fight back. But I need to warn you—if this continues, it won't end well for you. You know how the Hartleys operate."

Olivia laughed, her tone cool. "I doubt the Hartleys are any real threat to me right now. Sebastian, if you're in trouble, just say so. We've known each other long enough—I won't hold it against you."

Her calmness only deepened Sebastian's guilt. He exhaled shakily, voice thick with regret. "I need to get Evelyn out. She can't stay in this situation any longer."

Olivia didn't hesitate. "Fine. Come and get her."

###Chapter 376

The past few days had been nothing short of a waking nightmare for Evelyn Hartley. The cruel reality Miranda Graves had warned her about was now impossible to ignore—Olivia Sinclair was no longer the pushover she once believed her to be.

Starvation had reduced Evelyn and Miranda to desperate acts just to survive. They had been forced to kneel and bark like dogs for the amusement of their guards before being tossed scraps of food.

Evelyn, who had always carried herself with aristocratic grace, had endured humiliations she never thought possible. Olivia had orchestrated every moment of it.

The most agonizing part wasn’t the physical suffering—it was the slow, deliberate erosion of her pride. Olivia’s plan was to break Evelyn down piece by piece until nothing remained but a hollow shell. That plan, however, had been temporarily put on hold when Sebastian Whitmore arrived to retrieve her.

Stepping out of the dim, suffocating room, the sunlight felt foreign against Evelyn’s skin. When she spotted the guards by the door, terror seized her, and she dropped to her knees, trembling.

"I didn’t escape!" she blurted, her voice barely a whisper. "The door was opened for me. Please—I haven’t eaten yet. Just a little food, please!"

In the beginning, Evelyn’s defiance had been unshakable. But hunger was a merciless force, and even the strongest will crumbled beneath it. The mere thought of enduring another day in that hellhole made her stomach twist.

The two guards exchanged a glance before bursting into mocking laughter. "Look at the high and mighty Evelyn Hartley now," one sneered. "Errol’s precious fiancée, reduced to begging. You’re not even fit to lick Olivia’s boots."

Humiliation burned through Evelyn, but she forced a painful smile and nodded. "Yes, you’re right. Absolutely right."

"Evelyn!"

A sharp, familiar voice cut through the air.

Her head snapped up, disbelief flooding her features as she saw Sebastian standing at the end of the corridor—with Olivia beside him. Olivia, who had nearly fully recovered, moved with only the slightest hesitation in her steps. Sebastian hovered close, ready to steady her if needed.

When his gaze landed on Evelyn—crouched, disheveled, and utterly broken—his brow furrowed. This wasn’t the woman he remembered.

Relief at seeing Sebastian was quickly drowned by overwhelming shame. Standing there, exposed in front of her fiancé—and worse, under Olivia’s cold, triumphant stare—was unbearable. Evelyn ducked her head, her face burning.

Olivia seized the moment to twist the knife deeper. "What’s wrong, Miss Hartley?" she asked, her voice dripping with false concern. "Has it only been a few days, and you’ve already forgotten me? I’m curious—have you had time to reflect? Learned anything from your mistakes?"

Evelyn’s nails dug into her palms, her fists clenched so tightly they trembled.

Sebastian stepped forward, frustration lacing his tone. "Didn’t you hear Olivia speaking to you?"

Betrayal sliced through Evelyn’s chest. "You’re my fiancé," she whispered, her voice raw. "Why do you always take her side?"

Sebastian pinched the bridge of his nose, his patience visibly fraying. "Even now, you’re still so stubborn."

###Chapter 377

Olivia clicked her tongue sharply. "I had every intention of releasing Miss Hartley, but her hostility remains unchanged," she stated coolly. "If she's set free, what guarantee do we have she won't seek retribution like before?"

"Olivia!" Evelyn's eyes burned with venom beneath her tangled locks. "Look at what you've done to me. Isn't this enough for you?"

Olivia's response was glacial. "Not even close. Your suffering barely scratches the surface of what you've put me through all these years."

Evelyn sneered, her voice dripping with poison, "You were just a pathetic mute back then, trying to steal what was mine. You got exactly what you deserved!"

Olivia sighed, her gaze shifting to Sebastian, whose distress was palpable. "So the victim is to blame now? Sebastian, you see the danger I'm in. She's still a threat."

In a burst of frustration, Sebastian shoved Evelyn harder than intended, pinning her to the ground. "This is your own doing. I hoped for remorse, but you're exactly the same."

Sebastian delivered his ultimatum through clenched teeth. "Evelyn, if you want me to take you out of here today, you'll get on your knees and apologize to Olivia."

"Never!" Evelyn spat the word through gritted teeth.

Olivia waved a dismissive hand. "Then forget it. Take Miss Hartley back to her room."

At Olivia's command, the guards seized Evelyn, dragging her toward the dreaded darkness of that familiar cell.

Seeing the door to her personal nightmare looming again, Evelyn snapped.

With desperate strength, Evelyn broke free and threw herself at Olivia's feet, her head bobbing in frantic, mechanical bows - a grotesque pantomime of submission fueled by terror and simmering hatred.

Evelyn's voice was a broken rasp. "I'm sorry, Olivia. It's all my fault. I won't cross you again. Just... please don't send me back there."

Olivia looked down at Evelyn, her expression unreadable. She wasn't fooled. This apology was nothing but a survival tactic. Beneath the surface, Olivia knew the hatred still burned, but that didn't matter. True revenge, when served, should be a slow, deliberate feast.

Turning to Sebastian, Olivia gave a curt nod. "Take her away."

Sebastian reached to help Evelyn up, but as she stood, her legs gave way and she collapsed in a heap, appearing unconscious.

With no alternative, Sebastian scooped Evelyn into his arms and carried her out.

As they passed Olivia, Evelyn's eyelids fluttered open just enough to shoot Olivia a venomous glare, her lips curling in a triumphant smirk.

That look said everything - Evelyn still believed she held power over Sebastian's heart, and in her twisted mind, that meant she'd already won against Olivia.

In Evelyn's delusion, once she secured her position as Sebastian's wife, crushing Olivia would be child's play. To her, Olivia would always be the loser, destined to be trampled underfoot.

Beatrice's birthday gala arrived soon after. Olivia's legs had nearly healed completely, though her relentless search for Alistair had yielded nothing. Wracked with guilt, Isabelle couldn't eat or sleep properly. The stress had hollowed her cheeks, and Olivia's heart ached seeing her like this.

Hoping to lift Isabelle's spirits, Olivia decided to bring her to the gala, praying the festive atmosphere might offer some respite.

As expected, the Ellington family treated Olivia like royalty, attending to her every need with meticulous care. But it was the Blackwood family who commanded the most respect. Representing the Blackwoods, Victor and Catherine made their grand entrance at the event.
###Chapter 378

Olivia Sinclair swirled the crimson liquid in her crystal glass as she approached Victor Blackwood with practiced grace. "Congratulations, Mr. Blackwood," she purred, her voice smooth as silk.

Victor's shoulders stiffened at the sound of Olivia's voice. Ever since her return to Eldermere, misfortune had shadowed his every step like a persistent ghost. He couldn't shake the superstition that her presence brought calamity.

Now, surrounded by the elite of Eldermere society, Victor forced his lips into a tight smile. "Olivia, what exactly do you mean by that?" His fingers twitched against his own glass.

"Isn't it wonderful that I helped eliminate those troublesome elements for you?" Olivia's eyes sparkled with false warmth, her smile radiating what appeared to be genuine delight.

Victor's mood darkened instantly. He knew cutting ties with Miranda Graves had been the most prudent decision under the circumstances.

Yet he couldn't deny the operational headaches her absence created. Finding someone as obedient yet resourceful as Miranda wasn't an overnight task.

"You've had your revenge, Olivia," Victor said through gritted teeth. "Nothing actually happened to you. Miranda never intended real harm. If you continue this vendetta, you're essentially declaring war on the Blackwood family. Surely you don't want to make enemies before securing your position in Eldermere?"

Was that a threat? Olivia's mind flooded with contempt even as her expression remained serene. She nodded solemnly. "You're absolutely right. I could allow Miranda to return to your service."

Victor's face brightened momentarily before Olivia continued in a voice like chilled champagne, "Though I wonder if you'd dare trust her now. She's quite disillusioned with you, after all. And let's not forget how much suffering I've inflicted upon her - with you as the direct cause. I imagine she resents us both equally."

The smile slid from Victor's face like melting ice. Olivia maintained her radiant expression, though her eyes remained arctic. Victor's hands clenched into fists at his sides. Normally a master of emotional control, only two people could crack his composure - Liam Blackwood and Olivia Sinclair.

The resemblance between Olivia and Liam unsettled Victor profoundly. It was as if she reflected Liam's most dangerous qualities back at him. Catherine Winslow observed her husband's struggle with a sigh. Turning to her daughter, she suggested, "Lillian, darling, isn't that Isabelle over there? Why don't you go play with her?"

Lillian Winslow bore no resemblance to the meek, stuttering girl who had visited Olivia's home weeks earlier. Dressed in couture that cost more than most people's annual salaries, the young girl carried herself with aristocratic disdain, her nose perpetually tilted upward as she surveyed the room with imperial judgment.

Olivia understood perfectly. At Lillian's age, appearances meant everything - a fragile ego needing constant reinforcement through displays of superiority. She turned her attention to Isabelle instead.

Isabelle's face lit up like a sunrise. "Can I play with Lillian, Mommy?" she asked with hopeful eyes.

Olivia smoothed her daughter's hair affectionately. "Of course, sweetheart. Just stay where I can see you, and remember your manners."
###Chapter 379

Isabelle nodded eagerly and skipped off toward Lillian. Deciding not to waste her time on Victor any longer, Olivia turned her attention elsewhere. She moved through the crowd, reconnecting with familiar faces.

"Olivia!" Natalie's voice rang out as she rushed forward, pulling Olivia into a tight embrace. Tears shimmered in Natalie's eyes as she spoke, "We thought we'd lost you forever! It's been years since I last saw you. Daniel and I have missed you terribly."

Olivia felt emotion tighten her throat at those words. Part of why she longed to return to Eldermere was because of friends like these. Though they'd kept in touch through messages, it wasn't the same as being together in person.

Back then, Olivia had departed suddenly, driven by the Kensington family's urgent crisis. In her haste, she hadn't been able to say proper goodbyes. Now, reunited at last, a profound sense of relief washed over her.

Gently wiping Natalie's tears away, Olivia smiled softly. "Why are you crying like this? You're a grown woman now, yet here you are acting like a child. Isabelle takes after you. Come, let me introduce you - she'll be thrilled to see her godmother."

"Alright," Natalie replied, her eyes brightening. "I knew your voice had recovered, but hearing it again still feels miraculous. You have such a beautiful tone. If you pursued singing, you'd undoubtedly become a national sensation."

Olivia laughed at the compliment. As they walked together, Natalie linked arms with Olivia. "This way. There are two people I want you to see. They're here at the banquet too."

"Who?" Olivia asked, puzzled.

Natalie's eyes sparkled with playful mystery. "You'll know the moment you see them."

Olivia looked ahead and spotted Alexander and Isabella approaching hand in hand. The years had been kind - Alexander had matured into an even more distinguished gentleman, while Isabella radiated elegance and grace.

Olivia's gaze immediately caught the glittering diamond on Isabella's finger. She gasped and turned to Natalie. "They...?"

Isabella's face lit up when she saw Olivia. She hurried forward and clasped Olivia's hands. Though less demonstrative than Natalie, the emotion in her eyes was just as deep. "Olivia, I can hardly believe you're really here."

"My return is permanent this time," Olivia said warmly. "But enough about the past - don't you have wonderful news to share?" She glanced playfully between Alexander and Isabella.

Isabella's cheeks flushed pink as Alexander stepped closer, gently taking her hand.

"We only decided recently," Alexander explained. "Being a man of action, I wanted to celebrate immediately. We organized the engagement party as soon as possible. It was important to share this with you and," he added with a meaningful look at Isabella, "to set certain minds at ease."

Isabella huffed, "Whose mind exactly were you trying to ease - mine or yours?"

Alexander cleared his throat, his ears turning red. Watching their happiness, Olivia felt truly content.

Alexander suddenly remembered their purpose. Turning serious, he said, "Olivia, you must visit Grandfather when you can. He talks of little else these days. His health is stable, but we keep him indoors. If I hadn't promised you'd visit this weekend, he would have insisted on coming tonight. The older he gets, the more childlike he becomes - we can't reason with him."
###Chapter 380

Olivia couldn't suppress a soft laugh. "My grandfather behaves exactly the same way. Like a spoiled child sometimes."

At the mention of Alistair, Olivia's expression shifted visibly. Her smile faded to something barely there. The others exchanged confused glances, sensing the sudden shift in Olivia's mood but unable to pinpoint its cause.

Olivia had intentionally kept news of Alistair's disappearance private, sharing it with no one. Sensing the growing tension, Natalie smoothly intervened. "Olivia, why don't we go see Isabelle now?"

Just then, a piercing scream shattered the air, startling everyone. Moments later, a child's wail followed. Olivia's eyelids flickered, and she sprinted toward the commotion.

Isabelle sat on the marble floor, her dress smudged with dirt. Tears streamed down her flushed cheeks. Standing beside her with cold indifference, Lillian addressed the gathering crowd clearly. "I didn't do anything. She was caught stealing." Lillian's accusation sent murmurs rippling through the onlookers. "Good heavens! Stealing? At her age?" "Some children are just born troublemakers. Look at her mother - Olivia never was proper society material. The apple doesn't fall far."

Isabelle tried to protest, but at her young age, her words came out jumbled between sobs. A heavyset woman stormed forward and grabbed Isabelle's wrist roughly. "Well? Confess! I caught you red-handed with my bracelet. Such a little thief already! And still lying about it. Get out of here this instant!" She began dragging the struggling child away.

Olivia arrived just as Isabelle was fighting uselessly against the woman's iron grip. The child's delicate arm already bore angry red marks from the rough handling.

Fury surged through Olivia. She barely restrained herself from shouting as she swiftly intervened, prying Isabelle free.

Seeing her mother, Isabelle's controlled whimpers erupted into heart-wrenching sobs. "Mommy! I didn't take anything! I promise!"

Olivia took a steadying breath before fixing the woman with an icy stare. "Excuse me, but where's your proof? She's a child who doesn't even understand jewelry values. That bracelet wouldn't even fit her wrist."

The woman sneered arrogantly. "Why speculate about her motives? Some are just born thieves. I saw my bracelet in her hands myself." She smirked knowingly. "I remember how you used to cling to the Blackwoods for survival. Seems you still haven't shaken those low-class habits, passing them to your daughter."

"What exactly are you implying?" Natalie's voice shook with barely contained rage as she stepped forward. Isabella arrived just then, placing a restraining hand on Natalie's shoulder, her expression grave. "Natalie, control yourself," she murmured urgently before whispering to both women, "This is no ordinary woman - she's Victoria's aunt."

This meant she was sister to Beatrice, a formidable political figure in Crestwood. The former civil servant turned deputy mayor was known for her uncompromising integrity.

###Chapter 381

Olivia Sinclair had earned her position through sheer competence—stern, unyielding, and known for her unwavering sense of justice. After losing her parents, she had only one person left to cherish: her younger sister, Victoria Sinclair.

The woman standing before them now was none other than Victoria, the apple of Olivia's eye.

Natalie Bennett felt a chill crawl up her spine at Isabella's words, but her voice remained steady as she met Victoria's gaze. "I don't understand what's happening. But Isabelle is only two years old. How could she possibly know anything about stealing? Someone must be framing her."

Olivia gave Natalie a reassuring glance before stepping forward, her tone icy. "If you're accusing my daughter of theft, you'd better have proof. Otherwise, I'll have no choice but to call the authorities. If Isabelle is guilty, I won't defend her. She'll apologize and make it right. But first—prove she took your bracelet."

Victoria scoffed and pointed at Lillian Winslow. "I don't need proof. I have a witness. This girl was playing with your daughter earlier. I saw Isabelle sneak over, grab the bracelet from the table, and run off. Then this little one confronted her about stealing. I heard everything."

Olivia turned to Lillian, stunned. As more people gathered, Lillian shrank back, nervously twisting the hem of her dress. Olivia softened her voice as much as possible.

"Lillian, sweetheart, can you tell me what happened? Did Isabelle really take it? Or is there some misunderstanding?"

Lillian looked up at Olivia, her eyes filling with tears. Instead of answering, her lips trembled, and she burst into sobs. "I—I really saw her stealing! Why is everyone being so mean to me? I don’t want to play with her anymore! I want my mommy!"

The onlookers immediately assumed Olivia was bullying the child, their whispers sharpening. Victoria couldn’t resist sneering.

"You accuse me of bullying your daughter, yet here you are, pressuring another little girl to lie for her. What kind of mother does that? I doubt you're fit to raise a child. Just have Isabelle apologize and promise she won’t steal again, and I’ll let this go."

Olivia's temple throbbed as Lillian continued to cry uncontrollably. Isabelle clutched her mother’s hand, shaking her head frantically. "Mommy, I didn’t take anything! I swear! Why should I say sorry when I didn’t do anything wrong?"

Olivia stroked Isabelle’s hair gently. "Don’t worry, sweetheart. Mommy’s here." But as she looked into Lillian’s tear-filled eyes, she caught something unsettling—a flicker of guilt, a hint of smugness. Her stomach twisted. Even at this age, Lillian had already learned how to manipulate.

The Winslow family was no haven of virtue. Even their children had inherited their deceitful ways. Olivia’s lips curled in disgust as she leveled a frosty glare at Lillian.

"Isabelle won’t be apologizing," Olivia said to Victoria, her voice firm. "Because she didn’t steal anything. Your bracelet might be priceless, but that doesn’t mean we don’t own something just as valuable."

Victoria let out a mocking laugh, holding up her bracelet. "Do you even know what this is? Imperial jadeite—rare, flawless. Some of the guests here can verify its authenticity. Go ahead, examine it. See if I’m lying."

A few stepped forward, inspecting the bracelet closely before nodding in agreement. "It’s genuine. Extraordinary quality."

The murmurs grew louder.

Olivia’s jaw tightened.

This wasn’t just about a bracelet anymore.

It was a battle of reputations.

And she refused to lose.
###Chapter 382

The murmurs in the room grew louder as Olivia Sinclair stood her ground. "This isn't something you can simply purchase at any store. Seraphina Kensington has mastered the art of deception. How amusing." Her voice dripped with sarcasm. "After being cast out from the Kensington family, do you honestly believe she could afford such exquisite jewelry?"

The mocking laughter turned cruel. Several guests looked at Olivia with undisguised contempt, their gazes making her feel like something unpleasant they'd stepped in.

"I feel physically ill sharing the same space with a thief and her mother," one woman declared loudly.

"Can security remove them immediately?" another demanded.

Ignoring the ignorant crowd, Olivia calmly retrieved her phone. With practiced fingers, she located the digital certificate for the emerald bracelet she'd purchased at auction last month. The document clearly showed she'd acquired a piece worth three times what Evelyn Hartley claimed to have lost.

Olivia's voice cut through the noise like a blade. "The certification number is right here. Feel free to verify it right now if you doubt me. I don't make false claims."

Her confidence gave the onlookers pause. Uncertain glances were exchanged. Evelyn, however, remained unconvinced.

"Even if you can prove you bought one, what does that matter? Some people steal not out of necessity, but envy. Perhaps your daughter simply coveted my bracelet."

Olivia pocketed her phone with a derisive laugh. "I own multiple auction houses and have first pick of the world's finest jewels. The idea that my Isabelle would need to steal anything is laughable."

Evelyn gasped. "You're lying! How could—"

Done with this pointless exchange, Olivia turned her piercing gaze to Lillian Winslow, who stood trembling with guilt.

Olivia enunciated each word carefully, ensuring Lillian understood the gravity. "This hotel has comprehensive surveillance. The value of this bracelet constitutes grand larceny. I'm calling the police immediately." She paused deliberately. "I won't name names, but the mastermind should know that police involvement means arrest records. A conviction stays with you forever."

As predicted, Lillian collapsed to her knees, her face ghostly pale. "I'm sorry, Olivia! I took the bracelet and framed Isabelle! I didn't mean to! Please don't call the police!"

Olivia's disappointment cut deep. Their encounter days earlier had softened her toward the girl, assuming Lillian suffered under Catherine Winslow's roof. She never imagined such cunning from one so young—a perfect reflection of Catherine's worst traits.

The sudden confession stunned the crowd. Lillian knelt sobbing, as if suddenly realizing the magnitude of her actions. She began bowing repeatedly. "I'm sorry! It was me! Please don't make me leave!"

A bystander spoke up. "She's just a child. She didn't know any better. Let it go."

"Yes, she's young and foolish. Don't be so harsh," another added.

Olivia's lips curled at their hypocrisy. Where was this mercy when they'd condemned Isabelle without evidence? She'd never intended to punish Lillian—only to clear her daughter's name.

As Olivia reached to help Lillian up, someone moved faster.
###Chapter 383

Olivia Sinclair slipped into the grand hall unnoticed, her presence like a shadow amidst the glittering crowd. Without hesitation, she stepped forward and wrapped her arms around Lillian Winslow, her tears flowing freely. "Lillian! My poor darling! Why didn't you tell me you were being bullied? People must think I'm weak, that's why they targeted you. This is all my fault!"

Lillian clung to Olivia desperately, their shared sobs creating a pitiful spectacle. To any observer, they appeared as the wronged victims of some terrible injustice.

Victoria Sinclair regained her composure and turned blazing eyes toward Isabelle. "Are you satisfied now, seeing how this has ended?"

Isabelle let out a scornful laugh. "Need I remind you who created this scene? Who tried to throw my daughter out without hearing both sides? I know you look down on us, but my daughter is my line in the sand. Come after her, and you come after me."

A hush fell over the gathered guests, though Victoria still muttered under her breath, "Is that a threat? Who do you think you are? The audacity!"

Despite Victoria's obvious contempt, the crowd knew better than to cross Olivia Sinclair. News of her recent acquisition of Newport's largest auction house had spread like wildfire through high society. The Sinclair name now carried weight none could ignore.

Their earlier boldness had stemmed from seeing Olivia as just another divorced woman with a child. But her fierce protection of Isabelle had caught them off guard. Olivia turned her icy gaze on Catherine Winslow. "Catherine, have you forgotten your promise to me?"

Catherine froze at Olivia's words, her dramatic display faltering momentarily.

A flicker of panic crossed her features before she composed herself. After all, the Kensington family's influence in Crestwood far surpassed that of the Blackwoods. With this thought, Catherine regained some confidence. She rose from her kneeling position, maintaining her carefully crafted look of distress. "Olivia, I know you resent me for our past disagreements. I don't want to fight, but you shouldn't have dragged my child into this. You forced Lillian to confess to protect Isabelle. Is this how you raise your daughter?"

Olivia's lips curled in a cold smile. Clearly, Catherine had found herself a powerful ally.

"I knew it! You viper! You coerced her daughter into taking the blame. Your presence disgusts me. Get out!" Victoria's voice rang through the hall as she signaled to her security.

"Today is your sister's birthday celebration. We're all here for her. You can't simply eject a guest. Don't you care about your sister's feelings?" Natalie Bennett stepped forward, positioning herself protectively in front of Olivia as she glared at Victoria.

Victoria smirked. "And who are you? My cousin merely married into your family. That doesn't make you important. Move aside or I'll have you removed too."

Seeing Victoria's determination, Olivia knew the woman would follow through. Having accomplished what she came for, Olivia saw no reason to stay. She turned to Catherine, who now cowered behind Victoria. "Catherine, that painting you begged me to give you freely now serves as your gift to Beatrice Ellington. Is this how you repay kindness?"

Feeling the weight of judgmental stares, Catherine quickly denied the accusation. "No! Everyone, please listen! I paid good money for that painting. Olivia, stop spreading lies! How could it possibly be a gift from you? Mrs. Ellington loves the painting, and now you're trying to steal my credit, aren't you?"
###Chapter 384

Olivia's lips curled into a knowing smirk. "You'll regret those words."

A shiver ran down Natalie's spine as she caught the icy glint in Olivia's eyes. Something dangerous was unfolding. Victoria snapped at the security team, "What are you standing around for? Must I deal with this myself? Remove them immediately."

"Hold on!" A commanding voice cut through the crowd. A group approached swiftly, led by Victoria Ellington and Daniel Bennett.

Olivia hadn't spoken to Daniel in months. Since his marriage, she'd deliberately kept her distance. Seeing him now sent an uncomfortable flutter through her chest.

Daniel's expression darkened when their eyes met. He opened his mouth as if to speak, but a warning glance from Victoria silenced him.

Olivia's attention shifted to the elegant woman beside Victoria. The middle-aged woman wore stylish glasses that gave her a scholarly air.

It was clear from the sudden shift in atmosphere that this was Victoria's mother, Beatrice Ellington - the guest of honor at tonight's gala.

Beatrice withdrew her arm from Victoria Sinclair's grasp with deliberate slowness. "Enough of these ridiculous accusations! Olivia is my honored guest. Is this how we treat visitors in our home?"

Victoria Sinclair's jaw dropped before she forced a strained smile. "Beatrice, surely you can't be serious—"

Before she could finish, Beatrice turned to the guards with an impatient wave. "Can't you see she's hysterical? Probably had too much champagne. Escort her out until she regains her senses."

The security team immediately moved to usher a sputtering Victoria Sinclair away.

Murmurs spread through the crowd, confused by Beatrice's harsh treatment of her own sister.

But Olivia understood the game. Beatrice was preventing further embarrassment by cutting off Victoria Sinclair's theatrics.

This calculated move also gave Olivia an opening to establish favor, which she seized without hesitation.

With practiced grace, Olivia smiled at Beatrice. "Mrs. Ellington, there's no need for such measures. It was merely a misunderstanding."

Victoria Sinclair, however, remained oblivious to her sister's protective gesture. She struggled violently against the guards, breaking free to collapse dramatically on the marble floor. Her uncontrolled sobbing drew disapproving frowns from nearby guests.

"Yes, Mrs. Ellington, just a misunderstanding," Natalie interjected smoothly, flashing Beatrice a dazzling smile. "Mrs. Ellington, you remember me, don't you? Have you seen your birthday gifts yet? The Monet painting was from me. I must tell you, Olivia deliberately caused this scene tonight. Victoria had nothing to do with it - she's completely innocent. Poor Victoria has been distraught since the theft. Olivia simply took advantage of your kindness to target your sister. Please don't let her deceive you."

Beatrice studied Natalie with thoughtful eyes. "Ah yes, I do recall you. You gifted me that exquisite Monet. I've been collecting his works for years. Thanks to you, my collection is now complete."

Natalie's lips curved into a smug smile as she feigned humility.
###Chapter 385

The grand ballroom fell silent as Beatrice Ellington's cultured voice cut through the tension. "While I may not be an expert, I do appreciate fine art. When I heard of your passion for paintings, Mrs. Winslow, I considered it fate that we share this interest." Her gloved hand gestured gracefully. "So I must insist - for my sake - don't be too hard on Victoria. I'm certain the fault lies entirely with Olivia. Everyone here can attest to that."

Natalie Bennett offered a practiced, noncommittal smile while maintaining her silence. Tears spilled down Victoria Sinclair's cheeks as she gazed at Catherine Winslow with pathetic gratitude, her sobs growing louder. "Beatrice! Finally someone speaks the truth! Why won't you believe me? Are you afraid of Olivia Sinclair? Just say the word and her precious auction house will crumble."

"Enough!" Margaret Winslow massaged her temples, irritation flashing across her refined features. With a sharp wave of her hand, she commanded, "Remove her from my sight immediately."

Under her breath, Margaret couldn't resist adding, "Utterly foolish and embarrassing."

As attendants escorted the weeping Victoria away, the gathered elite exchanged uneasy glances in the sudden quiet.

Beatrice reached out and gently patted Catherine's hand in a show of unexpected solidarity.

Catherine flushed with a mixture of shock and pleasure at the attention. Having Beatrice Ellington's favor would mean protection from both the Winslow family's wrath and Olivia Sinclair's schemes.

But Beatrice's next words shattered Catherine's momentary triumph. Though her smile remained warm, an icy undercurrent ran through her cultured voice. Her gaze held Catherine with polite detachment.

"I've encountered many ambitious young women seeking my favor, hoping for some advantage in return. I've always maintained that expensive gifts are inappropriate - it borders on bribery, don't you think?"

"You're here to celebrate my birthday, and your good wishes are present enough. I approached you intending to return the painting. If genuine, it must be quite valuable. Though it seems I may have misjudged your intentions."

The subtle rebuke wasn't lost on the sophisticated crowd. Yet Catherine appeared genuinely thrilled, completely missing the subtext. She shook her head quickly. "Oh Mrs. Ellington, please don't think that! My gift was merely a token of respect. You remind me so much of my late mother. Please, think of me as... well, almost like a daughter to you."

Discreet smirks passed between guests. The audacity of Catherine Winslow positioning herself as Beatrice's potential goddaughter was almost comical.

Nearby, Beatrice's actual daughter Margaret Winslow stiffened, her expression darkening instantly.

Olivia couldn't resist a dry interjection. "Did you bother asking Miss Ellington how she feels about suddenly acquiring another 'sister'?"

Catherine's smile faltered before twisting into wounded dignity. "Olivia, I don't understand why you're so hostile. First your daughter frames mine for theft, now these accusations? Are you jealous of my connection with Beatrice? Resentful that I understand her better than you ever could?"

Turning back to Beatrice with exaggerated concern, Catherine continued, "Please don't judge Olivia too harshly, Beatrice. She's always been this way. When she was married into the Winslow family, Henry's indulgence made her quite arrogant. I'm sure she means no real harm. And please accept my apologies for her daughter stealing Victoria's belongings." Her saccharine tone dripped with false sincerity.

Olivia noted Beatrice's increasingly stern expression and nearly laughed aloud at Catherine's spectacular misstep.
###Chapter 386

Olivia realized Catherine was completely missing the point. Her patience wearing thin, she jerked her hand away abruptly.

"Escort her out!" Olivia commanded sharply.

At this, Catherine lifted her chin in defiance, her eyes flashing with contempt as she glared at Isabelle. But she hadn't expected the security team to actually move forward to remove her.

Catherine's bravado evaporated as she stammered, "Mrs. Ellington, what's happening? There must be some mistake! Didn't you like my gift? That's impossible - I spent a fortune on it!"

Beatrice's expression remained icy, forcing Catherine to reassess the situation with her limited understanding.

"You can't treat me like this!" Catherine shrieked. "I invested my entire savings in that gift! You accepted it, and now you're betraying me?"

The moment the words left her mouth, Catherine regretted them, but desperation had taken over.

Confusion clouded Catherine's mind. She couldn't comprehend what had angered Beatrice. The thought of reclaiming the painting crossed her mind - perhaps she could sell it later for some much-needed cash.

Now completely financially dependent on Victor, every extravagant purchase required signing an IOU. Catherine had dreamed of a better life after cutting ties with Liam, but her current situation was far worse than before.

Beatrice trembled with fury, pointing an unsteady finger at Catherine. "You... You..." She struggled to breathe, overwhelmed by Catherine's shameless behavior.

Victoria, seeing her mother's distress, quickly steadied her and snapped, "Remove her immediately! And return that painting to her."

Catherine was unceremoniously dragged out in full view of everyone. With the drama concluded, Olivia decided to take the upset Isabelle home for some rest. She turned to bid Beatrice farewell.

Unexpectedly, Beatrice pulled her aside.

"My dear," Beatrice began with a warm smile. "Were you surprised by my invitation? After all, you had no prior connection to our family. Truthfully, it was all for my daughter's sake."

Olivia frowned slightly. "Mrs. Ellington, what do you mean?"

Beatrice sighed, seeming to wrestle with her words before continuing gently. "Never mind that. My sister was quite rude today. Please accept my apologies on her behalf. I hope you're not too upset."

Olivia nodded understandingly. Victoria had indeed been harsh, but the real issue lay with Catherine and Lillian.

Changing the subject, Olivia smiled. "Mrs. Ellington, I hope you liked the birthday present I chose for you."

Beatrice's face lit up with genuine pleasure. "I adored it. Yours was my absolute favorite gift."

Olivia's gift hadn't been extravagant. She had hand-carved a crane symbolizing longevity - an intricate piece full of meaning, yet not particularly valuable.

Amelia had worried the present might seem inadequate. But Olivia understood Beatrice better. Far from ordinary, Beatrice required a different approach. Having devoted her life to her family, all she truly valued was sincerity.
###Chapter 387

Olivia had never planned to deliberately cultivate any connection with Beatrice.

The moment Olivia stepped out of the venue, her path was abruptly blocked. Catherine stood there, her eyes swollen from crying, her usually pristine hair now tangled and wild.

Olivia remembered Victor had left much earlier. He hadn't taken Catherine with him, and after a moment's consideration, the reason became clear: he believed Catherine had humiliated him. So he'd abandoned both Catherine and Lillian.

"Olivia!" Catherine spat through clenched teeth. "It wasn't until Victor pointed it out that I realized something was wrong. There's something off about that painting you gave me, isn't there? How could you be so cruel? I trusted you completely, and this is how you repay me?"

Olivia gently set Isabelle down and gestured toward the tearful child. "Look what you've done to my daughter. Even if I set you up, you deserved it."

Catherine flinched, guilt flashing across her face, but she quickly recovered with self-righteous indignation. "She's obviously a thief! You know how pure Lillian is. Why would she ever steal? Are all children wicked in your twisted mind? Do you see evil everywhere because that's all you have inside you?"

Olivia had no interest in continuing this pointless argument. Taking Isabelle's small hand in hers, she said softly, "Let's go home, sweetheart."

Catherine's voice rose in desperation. "You haven't answered my question, Olivia! Are you feeling guilty? You're just jealous of me, aren't you? That's why you ruined my chance with Beatrice! What kind of sick game are you playing?"

This was Catherine's last desperate attempt to change her fate.

Olivia paused, then turned back with an icy smile. "You're absolutely right. I have been playing a game. And you were incredibly naive to think I'd just hand over something that valuable for free."

Catherine blinked in confusion. "You owe the Winslows everything! Whenever I wanted something nice before, you'd just give it to me because you had so much. Wasn't it natural for you to gift me a painting?"

Olivia's sneer deepened. "Exactly. You always thought I was an easy target, expecting me to hand over whatever you demanded. This mess you're in? You brought it on yourself. That painting I gave you was a fake. If you hadn't been so gullible, maybe things would be different now."

Even if the painting had been genuine, Beatrice would never have accepted such an extravagant gift. Had Catherine possessed even basic intelligence, she wouldn't have foolishly offered Olivia's "gift" to Beatrice.

Olivia hadn't gone too far—the real painting was still safely at the auction house. Catherine's downfall came from her own arrogance and stupidity. She'd brought this on herself.

The truth shattered Catherine. With a scream of rage, she lunged at Olivia, fingers outstretched like claws. But before she could reach her target, security guards intercepted her.

Defeated, Catherine could only glare with venomous hatred as Olivia walked away.

Just as Olivia reached her car, a familiar voice called out. "Olivia!"

She turned to see Daniel hurrying toward her.

After a brief hesitation, Olivia greeted him with polite distance. "Mr. Bennett, what a pleasant surprise."
###Chapter 388

Daniel's gaze held a storm of emotions as he forced a polite smile, mirroring Olivia's formal tone though it clearly pained him. "Ms. Kensington. I didn't mean to delay you. It's been too long since we last met. Perhaps we could... catch up? How have you been?"

Olivia's lips curved into a brighter smile as she shook Isabelle's small hand gently.

The perceptive child immediately understood her mother's cue and turned to Daniel with an angelic grin. "Hello, Mr. Bennett."

Daniel's eyes lingered on Isabelle's cherubic face, a wistful expression crossing his features. "She's your miniature replica, especially those expressive eyes."

Isabelle tilted her head curiously, her pigtails swaying. "How do you know what Mommy looked like when she was little?"

Olivia answered with maternal patience, "We grew up together. He's like family to us - you can think of him as your uncle."

The careful distance Olivia maintained only deepened Daniel's anguish. The realization that any romantic future with her was impossible twisted like a knife in his chest.

Daniel's voice cracked with emotion. "If I'm family, why the formalities? You never called Alexander 'Mr. Hayes.'"

Olivia's forehead creased in response, but before she could explain, the sharp click of stilettos interrupted them. Victoria approached with regal grace, her beauty undimmed though her eyes held an arctic chill. She possessively looped her arm through Daniel's, deliberately flashing her wedding ring at Olivia.

Victoria's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Have I arrived at an inconvenient moment?"

Despite the pleasant tone, Olivia detected the venom beneath the words.

Seizing the opportunity, Olivia extended her hand warmly. "Not at all. I was actually hoping to invite you both to dinner after my return. Though I've been terribly busy - my apologies for the delayed invitation."

She then gestured to her daughter with maternal pride. "This is Isabelle. When might we expect your own happy news?"

The innocent child added cheerfully, "Mommy, if he's Uncle Daniel, does that make this pretty lady Auntie Victoria?"

Before Olivia could respond, Victoria jerked her hand away as if burned, her lips twisting into a sneer.

Victoria's gaze raked over Isabelle with disdain. "Already learning to network, I see. The apple doesn't fall far."

Daniel's face darkened instantly. "That's completely uncalled for! How could you speak to a child like that?"

Victoria's eyes blazed with fury, her voice dropping to an icy whisper. "Daniel! You swore you'd moved on from Olivia. Then why leap to defend her daughter? I've watched how you've been staring at her since she arrived!"

Daniel's jaw tightened. "She's like a sister to me. You're the one making this into something it's not!"

The tension between them crackled like static before a storm.
###Chapter 389

Olivia found herself reluctantly drawn into the tense exchange, though every fiber of her being screamed to stay out of it. She turned to Daniel with a mixture of exasperation and concern. "Mr. Bennett, while your wife's words may be harsh, she does love you. Perhaps if you showed her more reassurance, she wouldn't feel so insecure."

Victoria's anger simmered, but Olivia's unexpected intervention made her pause. She turned, her gaze sharp. "You seem to understand more than Daniel ever could."

The compliment hung in the air, laced with something colder beneath—like the glint of a blade hidden beneath silk. Daniel absorbed Olivia's words but remained silent, his jaw tight with restrained frustration.

Olivia moved toward her car, adjusting Isabelle in her arms. "She's getting sleepy. I should take her home to rest. We can all have dinner together another time."

But before she could open the car door, a hand clamped around her wrist. Victoria.

Her grip was unyielding, as if she feared Olivia might vanish into thin air. "Why postpone? Let's go tonight. I shouldn't have spoken so harshly earlier. If you refuse, I'll assume you're still upset with me."

Olivia hesitated. "Another night, perhaps. Isabelle really needs to sleep."

Victoria's persistence was relentless. "You just don’t want to dine with me, do you? If Isabelle needs rest, let the housekeeper take her home. You have bodyguards. What could possibly happen?"

Daniel finally snapped. "Victoria, enough. Why are you forcing this?"

Her temper flared. "I'm merely inviting her to dinner. Why are you so defensive? Do you think I mean her harm? Daniel, if there’s truly nothing between you two, why object to a simple meal?"

The accusation was thinly veiled, and Olivia felt the trap closing around her. She knew this dinner was unavoidable now—some things needed to be settled.

Though she trusted Beatrice Ellington to be reasonable, Olivia had no intention of provoking the Kensington family. It simply wasn’t worth the trouble.

She brushed a hand over Isabelle’s hair. "Will you be alright going back with the staff?"

Isabelle nodded confidently. "Mommy, don’t worry. The bodyguards and Mr. Winston will take care of me."

Olivia smiled, pinching her daughter’s cheek affectionately. "You’re my brave girl."

Daniel clearly disapproved of Olivia’s acquiescence, but one glance at Victoria’s stormy expression kept him silent.

Victoria selected an intimate, upscale restaurant. "Olivia, I hope this suits your tastes. I heard you’ve returned to the Kensington family and are living quite luxuriously. It must be difficult to remember what normal life was like."

Olivia ignored the barb, responding with a light laugh. "Not at all. Luxury hasn’t made me forget my past. Though I suppose I can’t compare to you—raised in privilege, never knowing hardship."

She glanced at Daniel. "You should be more considerate of your wife. She was once carefree, utterly adored by her family."

The tension between them was palpable, an unspoken battle of wills beneath the veneer of civility.

###Chapter 390

Daniel nodded solemnly. "I understand. I'll treat her with nothing but kindness and hope she learns to trust me."

Victoria pressed her lips into a thin line before letting out a derisive laugh, her eyes darkening with unreadable emotions.

When Olivia stepped into the restaurant, an unnatural hush fell over the space after just a few steps. Turning, she saw Victoria looking visibly distressed while Daniel whispered urgently in her ear. "What's wrong?" Olivia rushed toward them.

Victoria quickly composed herself, shaking her head. "It's nothing serious. The hospital just called - my mother fainted. I need to go check on her immediately."

"You should hurry then," Olivia said with genuine concern. "Medical emergencies shouldn't be delayed."

"She has these dizzy spells frequently. I'll just make sure she's stable." Victoria stopped Olivia from leaving, "You were invited for dinner, so I can't just abandon you. Wait here - I'll be back within an hour at most. It's still early for dinner anyway."

Daniel opened his mouth to speak for Olivia, but she responded first. "Alright, I'll wait. Just don't take too long."

Victoria nodded, took several steps away, then threw a meaningful glance back at Daniel.

Recognizing the silent warning in Victoria's eyes, Daniel said with regret, "I'm sorry Olivia, but I need to leave as well."

Olivia simply nodded in understanding.

As they approached the car together, Victoria suddenly changed her mind about going to the hospital. She appeared unsettled and took a step back. "Daniel, would you mind checking on my mother instead? I don't feel right leaving Olivia here alone."

After considering her request, Daniel found it reasonable and drove off without further discussion.

Watching Daniel's car disappear into the distance, Victoria's expression turned icy.

The restaurant's interior boasted exquisite decor.

Olivia had planned to wait in the garden, but soon a waiter approached her. "My apologies, but the garden is reserved for a private event tonight. Fortunately, you've booked a private dining room upstairs."

Following the waiter upstairs, Olivia barely had time to react when the door swung open and two large men lunged at her with practiced efficiency.

Before she could process what was happening, a rough hand clamped over her mouth. The more Olivia struggled, the tighter the grip became until she felt lightheaded from lack of air, forcing her to go limp.

As expected, the pressure eased significantly once she stopped resisting.

The man behind her chuckled darkly. "Should've cooperated from the start. Stay calm and you won't get hurt. Ms. Ellington is being generous - she's found you a suitable husband. Marrying him will keep you from seducing other women's men."

Seducing other women's men? Olivia realized Victoria must have orchestrated this entire setup. White-hot rage surged through her. Despite all her efforts to avoid conflict, Victoria remained relentless. She and Daniel, once close friends, had maintained strict distance for years, behaving like strangers just to prevent Victoria from getting the wrong idea.

Olivia had been considerate of Victoria's feelings at every turn, yet Victoria showed no mercy. Why was she doing this? Bitter tears streamed down Olivia's face as anguish and fury warred within her.

The man sighed, releasing her mouth only to grip her chin firmly. Before she could scream for help, his chilling words cut through the air like a blade.

###Chapter 391

The man's greasy laughter filled the dimly lit room as he leaned closer. "Let me make this clear, sweetheart. Every single person in this restaurant answers to Ms. Ellington. Scream all you want - nobody's coming to your rescue." His eyes raked over Olivia's trembling form. "Though I must say, tears make you even more breathtaking than those Hollywood starlets. Why would Ms. Ellington bother finding some rich fool for you? I'm perfectly capable of taking... good care of you."

His chuckle sent shivers down Olivia's spine.

Forcing herself to remain calm, Olivia's gaze darted to the narrow window. Situated on the second floor of this remote countryside restaurant, it was her only possible escape route. The busy highway behind the building might offer salvation - if she could reach it.

Summoning every ounce of acting skill, Olivia fluttered her lashes and offered a coy smile. "You're absolutely right. I'd much rather be with someone like you than some spoiled rich boy."

The man's smirk faltered momentarily. "Oh really? Wait-" His eyes narrowed with sudden suspicion. "You're playing me, aren't you? Planning to bolt the second I turn my back?"

"Of course not," Olivia purred, placing a delicate hand on his muscular forearm while suppressing her revulsion. "You're strong, healthy... who knows what kind of man Ms. Ellington might force on me? Do you think any wealthy bachelor would settle for someone like me?"

When he still looked doubtful, Olivia sighed dramatically. "I'm not stupid. There's no escaping this. Ms. Ellington wants me married off - she's made that perfectly clear. And with my... situation..." She let the implication hang in the air.

The man nodded eagerly. "Exactly! You're still a looker, even with a kid. Doesn't bother me none. Just promise to take care of me proper once we're hitched, and I'll let you stay." His grin turned greedy. "Heard you've got money too. That'll all be mine soon enough."

Olivia's smile nearly cracked at his blatant avarice.

As the man fantasized aloud about spending her fortune, Olivia noticed his expression shift from lust to condescension. Seizing the moment, she affected a blush. "I... I need to freshen up first. Wait here for me?"

She turned toward the bathroom, but his meaty hand shot out to grab her arm. "What's the rush, princess?" he sneered, breath hot against her neck. "Think I'm falling for that old trick? Strip. Now."

Olivia's pulse pounded in her ears as she forced a weak smile. "It's not like that... I just feel so uncomfortable. Surely you don't want our first time to be like this?"

His laughter turned cruel as he tightened his grip. "I said take your clothes off! Or do I need to help you?"

When Olivia froze, he seized her chin with brutal force, wrenching her head back until tears sprang to her eyes. Pain radiated through her jaw as his fingers dug into her flesh.

###Chapter 392

The moment the pill touched Olivia's tongue, it dissolved instantly. Too late to spit it out.

His cruel laughter filled the room as he sneered, "You swore you'd stay with me. Don't even think about running to anyone else now." He gestured toward the bed with a vicious grin. "Strip. Maybe I'll go easy on you."

Olivia blinked back tears, her icy glare fixed on the man before her. With a sudden burst of desperate energy, she lunged at him, nails raking toward his face.

But her weakened state betrayed her. The drug's effects were already taking hold, making her movements sluggish. A burning heat spread through her veins, sapping what little strength remained.

She bit down hard on her tongue, the sharp pain momentarily clearing her fogged mind. Yet the relief was fleeting - the fire within only grew more intense.

"Stop wasting your energy," he taunted, shaking his head. "Ms. Ellington provided the strongest aphrodisiac on the market. No antidote exists." His leer turned predatory. "You'll beg for a man before this night ends."

As he advanced, Olivia's tears fell freely now, tracing hot paths down her flushed cheeks.

The man pounced, his rough hands tearing at her blouse. His hot breath fanned her neck as he whispered filthy promises. "The media's already been tipped off about your little scandal. Ms. Ellington even handpicked some rich pretty boy for you." His grip tightened painfully. "But you're mine now. No use crying about it."

Olivia's hatred for Victoria Ellington burned hotter than the drug coursing through her.

Just as his fingers found the clasp of her bra, a sickening thud echoed through the room. The man collapsed like a marionette with cut strings.

Olivia's drug-addled mind struggled to comprehend. Through her blurred vision, she saw a tall figure striding toward her. The way he carried himself - shoulders squared, movements precise - seemed familiar.

Then she saw the mask.

"Mr. Blackwood?" The words came out breathy, tinged with an arousal she couldn't control. Her entire body burned, her cheeks flushed crimson. Tears made her eyes glitter dangerously in the dim light.

Liam Blackwood gathered her into his arms with surprising gentleness. "Olivia Sinclair," he murmured, "you owe me yet another debt."

Suddenly, the man's warning about the drug's effects crashed over her. With what little willpower remained, she pushed weakly against Liam's chest. "Go... please..." Her protest sounded more like an invitation, her hands barely applying pressure.

Liam's grip tightened. "Stop fighting me," he growled, his voice dark with warning.

Olivia trembled violently, the drug's effects reaching unbearable levels. A deep, primal ache threatened to consume her completely.

Liam laid her gently on the bed before turning toward the door. His voice turned glacial as he barked an order to someone unseen: "Get the antidote. Now."
###Chapter 393

Oliver stepped closer to examine Olivia's condition. His expression darkened as he shook his head. "I'm sorry, Mr. Blackwood. I wish I could help, but this drug is unlike anything I've seen before." The unspoken implication hung heavy in the air between them.

Liam's chest rose and fell rapidly as he processed the news. "Will her body be able to fight it off?"

Oliver's grim expression spoke volumes. "Her heart rate is already dangerously elevated. I'm not sure she can endure this alone."

Taking a deep, steadying breath, Liam gave a curt nod. "Understood. Leave us. Monitor the perimeter closely."

"Yes, sir." With a respectful bow, Oliver slipped out, closing the door with barely a sound.

Silence enveloped the room, broken only by Olivia's ragged breathing. Now alone with her, Liam reached up slowly to remove his mask.

The face revealed was strikingly handsome, though marred by a prominent scar running down his left cheek. The old wound still carried a faint reddish hue against his pale skin.

Settling beside Olivia, he took her trembling hand gently in his. His voice softened with nostalgic tenderness. "Since you're not fully aware, I'll show you my face. Don't be frightened by what you see."

Olivia had lost all sense of reality. Without warning, she surged upward, pressing against him with startling strength. With fluid, predatory grace, she straddled his lap, her movements both confident and desperate.

Liam's arms encircled her waist instinctively, his expression torn between desire and anguish. "Olivia, are you sure about this?" His question was answered when she captured his lips in a searing kiss that shattered his last shreds of resistance.

Two hours later, Liam lay back with a contented sigh, Olivia curled against his chest like an exhausted kitten. Her delicate features were relaxed in sleep, though an occasional soft whimper escaped her lips.

His fingers traced the contours of her face reverently, as if memorizing every detail. The moment felt surreal - too perfect to be real. A sharp knock shattered the peaceful silence.

"Mr. Blackwood?" Oliver's voice carried uncharacteristic hesitation through the door. "There's a media frenzy outside - major networks are here. Should we turn them away?"

Liam's response was ice-cold. "No. They're hunting for Olivia. If we don't give them something, they'll dig deeper."

Oliver couldn't suppress a muttered complaint. "Sir, this woman has turned everything upside down." Nearby, Sebastian delivered a swift kick to Oliver's shin. "Fool! What do you know of fate?"

To Sebastian, this reunion seemed like destiny's hand at work - a chance to mend what was broken. Yet with their stubborn natures and this new complication, reconciliation remained uncertain.

As the commotion outside grew louder, Olivia began to stir, her brow furrowing as consciousness returned. Liam's heart lurched when he saw her eyelids flutter. Panicked, he scrambled for his mask.

When he turned back, mask in place, he found Olivia's clear gaze locked onto his.
###Chapter 394

"Liam," Olivia whispered, her voice catching in her throat as she struggled to process what had just occurred between them. Yet she maintained an outward composure, rising from the bed with deliberate grace as she began dressing.

Her fingers trembled slightly as she fastened the buttons of her blouse. "Don't blame yourself," she said evenly. "We're both consenting adults who made our choices. Honestly, I should be thanking you. Without your intervention today, things could have ended much worse for me."

Liam remained motionless on the bed, an unfamiliar emptiness settling in his chest. Her detached response made him feel strangely disposable, as if their intimacy meant nothing to her.

As he sat up, the sheets slid down to reveal his chiseled torso - the defined ridges of his abdominal muscles, the powerful contours of his shoulders, all the way down to that tantalizing V-line that disappeared beneath the rumpled bedding.

He had so much he wanted to say, but all that emerged was a quiet, humorless chuckle. "You're taking this remarkably well."

Olivia finished adjusting her clothing and turned to face him. The moment their eyes met, Liam saw the glistening tears pooling in hers. Suddenly, she stumbled backward, knocking over the crystal vase on the nightstand.

Before Liam could react, Olivia snatched up a shard of broken crystal and pressed it against the delicate skin of her throat. A thin crimson line appeared instantly beneath the sharp edge.

Liam's pulse roared in his ears. He hastily wrapped the sheet around his waist and lunged forward. "Olivia, no!"

"Stay back!" she commanded, her voice breaking as tears streamed down her face. "Do you think I'm calm? My reputation is everything to me! I'm in agony because the man I gave myself to isn't the one I love. I didn't even know you before tonight! I refuse to be remembered as some wanton woman. If this is my fate, then I'd rather not live at all."

The raw despair in her eyes terrified Liam. He could see she was moments away from making an irreversible decision.

In a burst of panic, the truth spilled from his lips: "How can you say you don't know me? I'm the father of your child! Your ex-husband! This only happened because of the poison - if I'd had the antidote, I never would have... If you hate me that much, I'll vanish from your life forever. Just please, put the glass down!"

Olivia went completely still at his confession.

Seizing the moment, Liam carefully approached and pried the crystal shard from her grasp. As he did, Olivia lifted her gaze - and to his shock, all traces of anguish had vanished from her expression.

A cold, knowing smile curved her lips. "I knew all along," she said, her voice dripping with icy amusement. "I was just waiting to see how long it would take you to admit the truth."

Liam's stomach dropped. The calculating glint in her eyes made his skin prickle. "When did you figure it out?" he asked hoarsely.

Olivia exhaled sharply. "Your death story was convincing. I actually believed you were gone." Her gaze turned piercing. "But just now... I recognized you."

She offered no further explanation. The truth was simpler than Liam could imagine - she'd known him by the way her body responded to his touch, by the way her heart had recognized its other half even when her mind protested.

Olivia had loved Liam Blackwood for as long as she could remember. Some bonds even amnesia couldn't break.
###Chapter 395

Olivia knew every inch of his body by heart - the strong lines of his shoulders, the way his muscles tensed when he was angry. She recognized his mannerisms too, those subtle tells that betrayed his emotions.

For months, suspicions had gnawed at her. But never, not even in her darkest nightmares, had she imagined the truth would reveal itself like this.

With a bitter laugh, Olivia shook her head, her voice turning to ice. "Liam, how long do you plan to keep hiding behind that mask? Look me in the eyes."

Liam's intense gaze burned into her. Slowly, deliberately, he reached up to remove the disguise.

Before he could fully reveal himself, Olivia - overwhelmed by a storm of emotions she couldn't name - grabbed a shard of broken glass and slashed it across his right cheek with all her strength.

Years of pent-up rage, confusion, and heartbreak poured out in that single violent gesture.

Liam didn't flinch. Didn't retaliate. He simply stared at her with those dark, mesmerizing eyes as he finally removed the mask completely, exposing the horrific scar marring his left cheek.

To her shock, he smiled. "I was afraid this might frighten you. But seeing you now... I realize you're stronger than that. Olivia, it's been years. You've changed exactly how Henry and I always hoped you would."

Her breath caught as she stared at the grotesque scar. Her heart pounded wildly.

Fresh blood dripped from the wound she'd inflicted on his right cheek, stark against his pale skin. Instead of repulsing her, it made him more magnetic, more dangerously alluring.

Almost against her will, Olivia reached toward him. At the last second, she hesitated - but Liam was faster. His hand shot out, capturing her wrist.

With deliberate force, he pressed her palm against the bleeding cut. His eyes locked onto hers, filled with sorrow and something deeper, something that made her pulse race.

"See this, Olivia?" His voice was rough with emotion. "This is what I earned by betraying you. Do you hate me now? I'm not asking for forgiveness. I don't deserve it."

The usually composed Liam Blackwood faltered, his voice breaking.

Olivia couldn't speak. Torn apart by conflicting emotions, she stood frozen.

Recent events had opened her eyes to many truths, helping her understand some of Liam's past actions. But one fact remained unchanged - he had shattered her heart.

It didn't matter if he'd acted to protect her. The wounds still ached. The betrayal still stung. She hated him with every fiber of her being... and yet, some traitorous part of her still cared. Years of suppressed emotions finally erupted in uncontrollable sobs.

Distressed by her tears, Liam gently wiped them away, his hands trembling. "Don't cry. Please. This is all my fault. Hit me. Scream at me. Do whatever you need to do. I won't stop you."

In her anguish, Olivia grabbed his arm and sank her teeth into his flesh.

Liam hissed in pain, his brows knitting together. "Must you bite quite so hard?" he gasped through clenched teeth.

At that moment, urgent knocking interrupted them.

It was Sebastian, sounding alarmed. "Mr. Blackwood, more reporters are arriving. Security can't hold them off much longer. We need a plan immediately."
###Chapter 396

Liam's expression turned icy. "Olivia, emotions won't help us now. You must decide. Someone planned today's ambush, and it won't be their last attempt. You have two choices. First, leap from this window - my team is positioned below to catch you while I handle the aftermath. Second, announce our engagement to those vultures outside. That should shield you from future attacks. The choice is yours alone. I won't influence your decision."

Olivia stared at the window, knowing Liam spoke the truth. "Why are you doing this?" she whispered.

"Do I need a reason?" Liam's voice held steady conviction. "I'm helping because I love you - deeply, completely, irrevocably. I won't beg you to stay with me, but I will spend my life making amends if you'll let me."

Her breath caught. This raw honesty was unlike the guarded man she knew. Once, such words would have thrilled her. Now, though she expected numbness, her pulse quickened against her will.

Sebastian's urgent knocking grew louder, forcing Olivia to steady herself.

Outside, restless reporters buzzed with speculation after three hours of waiting.

"Is it really Olivia Sinclair in there?"

"Absolutely. The adopted Kensington daughter who tried seducing her foster brother. Now she runs that prestigious auction house."

"What a scandalous life! Leaving her child at home while chasing another man."

"But isn't she divorced? What's wrong with seeing someone new?"

"You don't understand - the man involved is Victoria Ellington's cousin! Rumor says he was already dating someone when this started. Imagine - the auction house CEO as the other woman! This will explode across Crestwood!"

The door swung open abruptly.

Olivia emerged first, her steps slightly unsteady. The reporters immediately swarmed like sharks scenting blood.

"Are you the mistress in this love triangle? Is Ms. Ellington's cousin inside? How does it feel being labeled a homewrecker?"

The aggressive crowd made Olivia sway dangerously.

Then a strong arm encircled her waist. A calm, authoritative voice cut through the chaos. "Gentlemen, you're mistaken. I was with Olivia the entire time. Now explain why you're calling my fiancée a mistress?"

Leaning into Liam's solid frame, Olivia added with deliberate sweetness, "How curious. Someone clearly wants to destroy my reputation. Though I can't imagine who'd benefit from such lies. Unless..." She eyed the reporters meaningfully, "Someone paid you to be here?"

The journalists recoiled as if scalded. They recognized Mr. Blackwood instantly - a name that struck fear in media circles.
###Chapter 397

Despite keeping the majority of his fortune hidden in offshore accounts, Mr. Jack's power remained absolute. He controlled the sprawling underground markets of Valtierra with an iron fist. Wealthy patrons from Eldermere frequently found themselves queuing up for his exclusive goods when mainstream sources failed them. Those foolish enough to cross him never lived to regret it.

The assembled journalists shifted nervously, their heads shaking in frantic denial.

One particularly pale reporter stammered, "N-no—we weren't paid by anyone! We came to investigate rumors, not spread lies!"

"Is that so?" Olivia's lips curled into a dangerous smirk as she stepped forward. "Yet moments ago, you were quick to label me a mistress. Had my companion today been less influential, I imagine you'd have happily slandered me without consequence, wouldn't you?"

Liam's eyes darkened at the accusation.

Several reporters' knees buckled, their hands trembling uncontrollably. "W-we would never! We're journalists—truth is our profession! How could we possibly—"

With a derisive laugh, Olivia closed the distance to Liam, tracing a single finger down his chest. "What shall we do with these liars, darling? They seem determined to hide the truth."

Liam caught her wandering hand, his grip firm. "Don't move," he murmured, voice thick with warning.

Olivia recognized the heat in his gaze, feeling her cheeks flush. Liam had always been dangerously responsive to her touch. Were they not maintaining appearances, she'd never have dared such proximity.

A slow smile spread across Liam's face as he gave her shoulder a reassuring squeeze. When his attention returned to the reporters, his expression turned glacial. "Since they refuse honesty willingly, we'll extract it by force. Let's see how long their loyalty lasts when faced with real consequences."

One journalist broke first, collapsing to his knees with a choked sob. "You're right! Someone did order us to do this! But we had no choice—angering the Ellingtons means losing everything! Please, Miss Sinclair, have mercy!"

The man began kowtowing desperately against the marble floor.

Like dominoes, half the remaining reporters followed suit, their pretense of innocence crumbling.

Olivia's anger burned white-hot. How had Victoria managed to bribe so many media outlets? This was clearly a calculated attempt to destroy her reputation.

She couldn't comprehend what she'd done to deserve such hatred from Victoria. Why was the woman so determined to ruin her?

"I'll let you decide their fate," Liam's voice pulled Olivia from her spiraling thoughts. "What would you have me do with them?"

Drawing a steadying breath, Olivia met the reporters' terrified gazes.

"I don't want them harmed. I only want the truth published. Some claim they merely took compromising photos without intent to spread rumors. Fine. Then they'll print exactly who I was with today and under what circumstances. Is that clear?"

The journalists nodded frantically.

Liam's voice cut through the room like winter wind. "Get the story straight. Olivia and I met abroad years ago. She saved my life. I pledged myself to her then, and I intend to marry into the Sinclair family."

###Chapter 398

Olivia Sinclair raised her chin, her emerald eyes flashing with disbelief. This charade had gone far enough. He didn't need to say those words, yet she refused to let it unsettle her.

After skillfully handling the swarm of reporters, Olivia gracefully disentangled herself from Liam Blackwood's embrace.

As she reached the sleek black car and slid into the leather seat, ready to depart, her breath caught when Liam shamelessly followed and settled beside her. "What are you doing?" she demanded, arching one perfectly shaped eyebrow. "The performance is over."

Liam blinked those infuriatingly innocent blue eyes. "We must maintain appearances, darling. There could still be paparazzi watching." He adjusted his cufflinks with practiced ease. "Besides, I haven't seen our precious Isabelle in weeks." A shadow crossed his chiseled features.

Olivia's lips parted, then pressed into a thin line. She couldn't deny him this. Not when Isabelle needed her father.

The ache in her daughter's eyes whenever classmates spoke of their dads still haunted Olivia's dreams.

Every child deserved love from both parents - this truth burned in Olivia's heart.

Through Olivia's unwavering devotion, Isabelle had never felt lacking... until recently.

Lately, Olivia had noticed Isabelle's quiet sadness during bedtime stories. "Fine," she conceded, her voice glacial. "But heed my warning. If you hurt her - if you so much as make her feel unwanted - you'll never see her again. She's my everything. Understood?"

Her gaze could have frozen molten lava.

Liam's throat worked as he took in this transformed version of the timid girl he'd once known. The girl who'd followed him like a shadow, enduring cruelty without complaint.

"I understand," he said gravely, offering no empty promises. Actions would speak for him now.

Isabelle was still at kindergarten when they arrived.

Olivia checked her diamond-encrusted watch - class wouldn't end for hours. They'd wait by the wrought-iron gates.

Two hours later, the final bell chimed. Children streamed out like colorful confetti, yet Isabelle remained missing.

Olivia's pulse skyrocketed. She rushed inside, heels clicking urgently against polished floors. The teacher looked up, startled, from organizing crayons. "You're Isabelle's mother?"

Olivia's manicured nails dug into her palms. "Has someone taken her pretending to be me?"

The teacher paled, scrambling for records. Her hands trembled as she compared documents. The realization struck like lightning - this elegant woman was indeed Isabelle's mother.

Horror dawned on the teacher's face. "An older gentleman always collects her! Today, a sophisticated woman came, claiming to be you. Isabelle went with her willingly! She seemed so convincing!"

The blood drained from Olivia's face.

Liam's expression turned murderous.

Somewhere in the city, a little girl with golden curls clutched a stranger's hand, utterly unaware of the storm about to break.
###Chapter 399

Liam's jaw tightened with visible frustration as he demanded, "The preschool must have contact records for all authorized guardians. Did you even attempt to call the elderly gentleman?"

The teacher twisted her fingers nervously, her voice wavering. "I panicked in the moment. Some parents delegate pickup duties to us regularly. With so many children to supervise, I couldn't possibly—"

Olivia inhaled sharply, forcing her racing pulse to steady. "That's no excuse for negligence. But I'm not here to punish you. If you truly want to help, start by giving us a detailed description of the woman who took my daughter."

Relief flashed across the teacher's face as she bowed slightly. "Thank you for your understanding. I'll pull up the security footage right away."

Meanwhile, Isabelle found herself being led into an unfamiliar apartment by the elegantly dressed stranger.

Isabelle's keen eyes missed nothing. The moment they stepped inside, a rotund boy came barreling toward them.

Yanking her hand free, Isabelle planted her feet and crossed her arms. "You promised an apology. Let's get this over with. My mother expects me home."

The boy's malicious laughter filled the room. "You actually believed my mother? What an idiot!"

Isabelle's brow furrowed. "Explain yourself. Was this all a trick?"

The woman shoved Isabelle aside impatiently. "Such a nuisance. I had to waste my afternoon because of you."

Grinning, the boy declared, "I like her, Mother. Can we keep her as my personal maid?"

The woman's stern expression melted instantly. "Oh, my precious boy! If that's your wish, consider it done. How generous of you to offer her this opportunity."

Isabelle's eyes widened in disbelief. "This is kidnapping! The authorities will—"

The woman's mocking laughter cut her off as if she'd told the world's most absurd joke.

Sharp nails dug into Isabelle's cheek, leaving angry red marks.

"You think I fear the police?" The woman's voice dripped with contempt. "My family has powerful connections. You? Just a penniless old man and his brat. Harm comes easily to those who cross us. Remember that if you value your grandfather's safety."

The thinly veiled threat hung heavy in the air.

Isabelle instantly recognized their ignorance about her mother's true influence.

Playing along, she forced her voice to tremble. "If you're so powerful, who protects you? Someone above the law?"

The woman preened with satisfaction. "My darling boy is a Blackwood. You've stumbled into something far beyond your station, little girl. From now on, you'll serve his every whim. You should be thanking us for this honor."
###Chapter 400

The small child dashed forward, clutching the woman's fingers with his tiny hands. "Mother, she's beautiful," he declared in a petulant whisper. "I wish to marry her when I'm grown."

The woman's face lit up with maternal pride as she stroked his hair. "Darling boy, she's merely a commoner's child. At best, she might serve as your plaything. Such lowborn creatures shouldn't even breathe the same air as you when you're older."

The boy squared his shoulders, his juvenile arrogance palpable.

Isabelle remained motionless, her icy stare boring into them. These fools had no inkling of the storm they'd unleashed. She knew her mother would make them pay dearly.

Pleased with her dominance, the woman suddenly shoved Isabelle violently, sending her stumbling backward.

"Get to the kitchen and start learning proper cooking!" the woman shrieked. "My precious son can't survive on my cooking alone. And don't forget to call your grandfather - tell him everything's perfect here. Stay obedient, and perhaps I'll permit you to continue attending school with my son. Step out of line..." She let the threat hang ominously in the air.

Isabelle studied their menacing expressions meant to cow her. Instead of defiance, she adopted a submissive posture, feigning meekness as she shuffled toward the kitchen.

The front door swung open abruptly, revealing a disheveled man entering the house.

The woman and child rushed to greet him with theatrical enthusiasm.

"Father!" the boy cried. "Darling!" the woman cooed.

Curious, Isabelle turned to observe this supposedly important man. He bore no resemblance to the powerful figure they'd described - his beard was scraggly, his eyes dull and lifeless. But when his gaze landed on Isabelle, they widened in stunned recognition.

The man strode forward and seized Isabelle's wrist, his disbelief evident.

"Richard's voice came out strangled. "Who is this child? Explain this immediately!"

The woman stepped forward with a saccharine smile. "She's a classmate of our son's from kindergarten. Though she offended him, our generous boy wished to give her a better life, so I brought her home."

The truth behind Richard's contempt ran deeper than appearances suggested. Isabelle's features bore an uncanny resemblance to Olivia Sinclair in her youth, resurrecting memories Richard had spent decades burying.

Now middle-aged and washed-up, Richard's life had become a grotesque parody of his ambitions. He'd murdered his own mother and framed Liam.

Rather than confront his failures, Richard had convinced himself Liam was responsible for everything. In his twisted reasoning, had Liam simply surrendered control of Blackwood Enterprises, none of this would have occurred. It was easier for Richard to direct his rage at Liam, and by extension, despise Olivia.

Richard had heard rumors of Olivia's triumphant return to the Kensington family and her successful auction house venture. To his fury, even that fool had suffered losses at Olivia's hands.

Isabelle's striking resemblance to young Olivia both unsettled and enraged Richard. As long as this child wasn't Olivia's daughter, Richard saw no reason not to unleash his pent-up fury on her.

Without warning, Richard's arm shot up as he hurled a porcelain vase against the wall, sending shards scattering across the floor.

The violent crash echoed through the house.

Silence followed.

Then Richard's breathing grew ragged as his fingers twitched toward Isabelle's throat.
###Chapter 401

The shattering explosion of glass pierced the air as the bottle smashed violently at Isabelle's feet.

She gasped sharply, recoiling as razor-sharp fragments sprayed toward her. One particularly jagged piece sliced across her porcelain cheek, leaving a crimson trail.

Blood welled instantly from the wound. Isabelle pressed a trembling hand to her stinging face.

Richard's lips twisted in cruel amusement as he seized her wrist. "Stupid girl!" he spat, alcohol thick on his breath. "Clean this up! Now!"

But Isabelle had inherited her mother's fiery spirit. Despite the pain, she glared back defiantly. "You broke it. You clean it."

Richard's face darkened with rage. "You insolent little brat!"

The whiskey fueling his temper, Richard swung with brutal force. His palm connected with Isabelle's face in a sickening crack.

The impact sent her sprawling onto the shattered glass. Shards embedded in her palms and knees as blood bloomed across her clothes.

Yet Richard felt only vicious satisfaction watching her suffer. To his drunken mind, Isabelle wasn't just a child - she was the living image of Olivia Sinclair, the woman he despised.

For years, Richard had endured humiliation within the Winslow family. Powerless. Disrespected. But now, with this trembling girl before him, he finally felt control.

The woman and boy huddled in the corner watched with familiar terror. They knew Richard's drunken rages well - usually directed at them. Tonight, Isabelle had become his unfortunate target.

The child's whimpers of pain only enraged Richard further. "Shut up!" he roared, striking her again. "Stop your crying! You look just like that whore Olivia - you deserve this!"

"Enough!" A voice like frozen steel cut through the chaos.

Richard froze. That voice - impossible after all these years.

He turned slowly, blood turning to ice in his veins. There, flanked by armed guards, stood Liam Blackwood - alive and glowering with murderous intent.

Richard's legs gave way. He collapsed to the floor, body convulsing with terror. "No... no... you're supposed to be dead!" he babbled incoherently.

The nightmare had returned.
###Chapter 402

Liam's piercing gaze locked onto Richard, who now trembled uncontrollably on the floor. Just minutes ago, Richard had been the one exerting power over Isabelle, but the tables had turned dramatically.

A sneer twisted Liam's lips. The thought of Richard taking over Blackwood Enterprises was laughable. Even if he succeeded, he'd run it into the ground within months.

The woman recovered first, stepping forward with false bravado. "Who do you think you are? How dare you break into my home?" Her shrill voice cracked with poorly concealed fear.

Oliver moved beside Liam, his confident stride echoing through the room. "Take a good look," he said with deliberate arrogance. "This is Mr. Blackwood. Surely even you recognize that name."

Confusion clouded the woman's face. "Mr. Blackwood? My husband is Richard Winslow, heir to the Winslow fortune!"

Recognition flashed in Richard's eyes as he noticed the distinctive mask. His face drained of color. Mr. Blackwood's reputation preceded him - a shadowy figure whose rare appearances in Eldermere always left lasting impacts.

Panic seized Richard as he yanked his wife aside. "Shut up!" he hissed. "Do you have any idea who we're dealing with?"

Meanwhile, Isabelle spotted Liam and rushed forward without hesitation. Her previous encounters with him at Mercy Hospital had shown her a different side of this intimidating man. Where others saw danger, she saw kindness in his eyes.

"Please," Isabelle begged, her small voice urgent. "Take me to Mother. She must be so worried about me."

Liam's heart clenched as he lifted the injured child. Fresh cuts marred her tiny hands and legs, yet her only concern was for Olivia. His respect for Olivia grew - she'd raised an extraordinary daughter.

Gently pinching Isabelle's cheek, Liam asked softly, "Does it hurt?"

Isabelle nodded solemnly. "Yes. But Mother says crying makes the pain worse. And I won't give them the satisfaction of seeing me weak."

The maturity in her words stabbed at Liam's heart. "You don't have to be strong anymore," he murmured. "I'll protect you now. You can cry if you need to." His gaze turned glacial as it shifted to Richard's family.

Richard cowered on the floor, humiliation and terror warring on his face. Once, he might have stood tall as a Winslow heir. Now, stripped of power and privilege, he was utterly vulnerable.

Desperation drove Richard to his feet. He bowed deeply, his voice shaking. "Mr. Blackwood, I swear I wasn't involved! I just returned home to find someone bothering my son. I had no idea she was your daughter - I would never have dared if I'd known!"

The air thickened with tension as Liam's unspoken threat hung between them. Richard knew one wrong move could give Victor the perfect excuse to destroy what remained of his standing.

Liam adjusted Isabelle carefully in his arms, his protective embrace sending a clear message. The game had changed, and Richard had just lost his last remaining advantage.
###Chapter 403

Liam held little Isabelle protectively in his arms. "She may not be my biological child, but I've sworn to protect her with my life. Her mother is Olivia Sinclair - a name I'm sure you recognize. If Olivia were to get involved, the consequences would be far worse than anything I could do."

"Olivia Sinclair's daughter?" Richard gasped, his face draining of color.

In a sudden burst of fury, Richard turned and struck his mistress hard across the face. "You stupid woman! You've dragged us into a disaster! You told me her family was poor, just some old grandfather picking her up!"

The mistress clutched her stinging cheek, scrambling for excuses. "I only ever saw an elderly man collecting her! How was I supposed to know—"

Her voice trailed off as realization dawned - they'd messed with someone under powerful protection.

The revelation hit Richard like a physical blow. Mr. Blackwood wasn't someone to cross lightly, and now they were knee-deep in trouble.

Blinded by panic, Richard grabbed his son and shoved the boy toward the broken glass shards. The child screamed in pain.

"My deepest apologies! This is entirely my fault for failing to discipline my son properly. Please, don't take offense - we meant no harm," Richard begged, desperation thick in his voice.

Turning to Isabelle with a painfully forced smile, Richard cooed, "Sweetheart, see? He's apologized. Can you forgive us? We truly didn't mean to upset you. I'll buy you anything you want - pretty dresses, toys, whatever your heart desires."

Richard foolishly hoped his bribes might smooth things over, underestimating the sharp mind behind Isabelle's youthful face.

Isabelle remained unmoved, her expression stern. "You're the one who needs to apologize. They brought me here and weren't nice, but you're the one who hit me."

Richard recoiled at the child's unexpected assertiveness - a clear reflection of her mother Olivia's famous stubbornness and strong will.

Liam's gaze burned with contempt. "Did you really think you could trick her just because she's a child? Richard, look what you've become. Today, you'll learn your lesson the hard way."

Richard tried to convince himself this was just bad luck. Without hesitation, Liam called Victor on speakerphone. "Mr. Blackwood, it's been a while. Do you recognize my voice?"

Victor responded cautiously, "Who is this?"

"Mr. Blackwood. Ring any bells?"

Recognition flashed across Victor's face, his tone shifting immediately. "Of course, I know who you are. What can I do for you?"

Liam explained the situation with biting sarcasm. "Richard is, after all, a Blackwood. Despite his reprehensible behavior toward my goddaughter, I must be careful. Direct punishment might make me look like I'm bullying poor Richard."

Victor chuckled darkly. "No need for such concerns. Richard has been a thorn in our side for years. It's high time the Blackwood family severed ties. Though I never imagined he'd sink this low. Mr. Blackwood, your testimony is all I need. Consider him officially disowned. No more cleaning up his messes."

Liam made sure Richard heard every damning word. The impact was immediate - Richard's face twisted with rage as he snatched the phone.

"You're the one who should be disowned, Victor! Remember, I know enough to bury us both! If I go down, you're coming with me!" Richard screamed into the phone, his voice raw with fury.
###Chapter 404

Victor Blackwood fell silent on the other end of the line. After a tense pause, his voice dripped with sarcasm. "Let's see who the public will believe - me or you. Considering your long list of misdeeds..."

Richard Winslow's face turned ashen. His knees buckled as he collapsed onto the cold marble floor. This was the end. If only he'd known helping Victor destroy Liam would lead to this. Now Victor held all the power in the Blackwood family. No one dared oppose him anymore.

Richard's hands trembled with rage. As the legitimate heir of the Blackwood dynasty, why wasn't he inheriting what was rightfully his? The injustice burned through him like acid.

Liam observed Richard's breakdown with icy detachment. While satisfying, this wasn't enough. With Richard eliminated, who would remain to keep Victor in check?

Clearing his throat, Liam spoke into the phone. "Mr. Blackwood, I must advise against this. Yes, Richard has made mistakes, but he remains your elder brother. Do you want the world whispering about how you seized his position and now seek to banish him completely? Let's not forget - you were never meant to inherit anything. Without coercing Richard to relinquish his rights, you wouldn't even be permitted inside the Blackwood estate."

Victor's furious roar vibrated through the receiver. "Who the hell do you think you are? Shut your mouth!"

"Verify my claims if you dare take the risk," Liam countered smoothly.

For a fleeting moment, Victor wondered if Mr. Black could actually be Liam. But he dismissed the absurd thought immediately. Liam was dead. This couldn't possibly be him.

Rubbing his throbbing temples, Victor demanded, "How do you know so much about the Blackwoods?"

"There's nothing I don't know," Liam replied with a knowing smile. "Mr. Blackwood, you've only glimpsed my capabilities. Shall we test them? All I require is a sincere apology from your family. Fail to deliver, and I'll handle matters... differently."

Victor crumbled. He barked orders to retrieve Richard before adopting an ingratiating tone. "Mr. Black, name your price. We'll move heaven and earth to accommodate you. Rest assured, no one in Crestwood will trouble your goddaughter again."

Liam's chuckle carried through the line. "No need for haste. We'll discuss compensation when she's older. Oh, my memory fails me - I nearly forgot the Blackwood family's declining fortunes. Let's hope Crestwood still recognizes your name by then."

"Your concern is touching," Victor spat through clenched teeth before slamming the phone against the wall. "Useless Richard! Nothing but trouble!"

Before departing with Isabelle, Liam ensured Richard's family paid their dues. He made them kneel in humiliating formation at the entrance, bowing to every passerby. After enduring this public degradation for an entire day, their reputations lay in tatters. Richard's son was permanently expelled from the prestigious kindergarten.

By the time Olivia Sinclair arrived, the spectacle had concluded. Isabelle nestled contentedly in Liam's arms, giggling as she played with his mask.

Olivia's eyes widened with surprise and a flicker of envy. "You two became close rather quickly."
###Chapter 405

Isabelle spotted Olivia and immediately squirmed out of Liam's embrace to run toward her mother. "Mommy! I missed you so much!" Her small arms wrapped tightly around Olivia's waist. "I'm okay, really. It was my fault - I shouldn't have gone with that stranger."

Olivia's breath caught when she noticed the bruises on Isabelle's arms. "Sweetheart, what happened?" Her voice trembled with barely contained panic.

Turning to Liam, Olivia's eyes flashed with anger. "What were you thinking? She's hurt! Why didn't you take her straight to Mercy Hospital?"

Isabelle shook her head violently, her golden curls bouncing. "No, Mommy! It was me - I didn't want to go. I knew you'd be scared if you saw me there again."

Memories of the last Kensington kidnapping flooded Olivia's mind - how Isabelle's throat had been bruised, how she'd cried herself to sleep for weeks afterward, waking with puffy eyes every morning.

Her daughter couldn't stand seeing her in pain. Isabelle stretched up on tiptoes, small fingers brushing away Olivia's tears. "Don't cry, Mommy. I'm right here. I'll protect you now - nobody will ever hurt you again."

Liam's chest tightened watching them. He stepped closer. "Isabelle, you don't have to worry. I'll keep you safe. That's what godfathers do."

Olivia's tears stopped instantly. She scooped Isabelle into her arms, her expression turning to ice. "Godfather?" Her laugh was sharp as broken glass. "My daughter doesn't have one."

Liam flushed. "Why not? That's ridiculous."

"Ridiculous?" Olivia's voice dropped dangerously. "Did you even ask if she wanted you as a godfather?"

Isabelle shook her head so hard her curls whipped her cheeks. "I don't need a godfather. I have my real daddy. Mommy says he's the best man ever. You're nice, but you're not him. My daddy doesn't hide his face like you do."

The words hit Liam like physical blows. He swallowed hard, forcing a smile that didn't reach his eyes. "You're absolutely right, sweetheart. I'm not worthy to be your godfather. I shouldn't have—"

Olivia's expression shifted abruptly. "Hospital. Now."

After Isabelle's injuries were treated, Olivia decided to keep her home from kindergarten. Her brilliant daughter could miss months of school and still outpace her peers. She'd only enrolled Isabelle for socialization, but clearly that plan had backfired spectacularly.

Olivia prepared to claim control of Blackwood Enterprises - she hadn't forgotten their wager. But as she turned to leave, Liam caught her wrist.

He cleared his throat awkwardly. "Olivia, wait. The bet...it was just an excuse. I needed to see you. And if you lost...well, that meant I'd get to see you again."

Olivia studied him with cool detachment. "Let me understand this. Exactly how many favors do I owe you? I don't like being indebted."

Liam looked stricken. "No! You don't owe me anything!"

"Is that so?" Olivia arched one perfect eyebrow, her lips curving in a smile that didn't reach her stormy gray eyes.
###Chapter 406

Liam cleared his throat, abruptly changing the subject. "But I still need your assistance. I've been drowning in work lately. You, however—you handled that auction house like a seasoned professional. I'm still getting familiar with the business. Without Victor and Richard, they would've played me like a fool."

Olivia studied Liam's unusual charm offensive, suspicion flickering in her eyes. Was this really the same Liam she knew? He had never behaved this way before.

Olivia cut straight to the chase, her voice turning serious. "I can help you, Liam. But on one condition: If I assist you, you'll sell me the company for thirty percent of its value. That's my offer."

At Olivia's words, Oliver, seated in the front passenger seat, widened his eyes in shock and blurted out, "Absolutely not. That's daylight robbery—"

"Ahem!" Sebastian quickly interrupted with a pointed cough, shooting Oliver a warning glance.

Oliver muttered sulkily, "Mr. Blackwood won't agree. This is practically charity, just surrendering to an outrageous demand."

"Alright, but I don't want your money. I'll give it to you for free." Liam stunned Oliver by agreeing with Olivia. Oliver fell silent, turning to stare blankly out the window. His image of Liam shattered—Liam had never acted this way before.

Olivia was taken aback by Liam's immediate compliance. She was about to accept when realization struck her. A businessman like Liam wouldn't agree so readily without an ulterior motive. There had to be strings attached.

Sensing her hesitation, Liam felt a pang of hurt. He gently took her hand, his expression earnest as he met her gaze. "To be completely honest, Olivia, I'd give you anything you asked for, anything at all—as long as it's for you and Isabelle. I mean every word."

Olivia searched Liam's eyes for a long moment. Then, a faint smile touched her lips. "Never mind. I just realized my request might have been unreasonable. I need to reconsider."

Liam's calm facade cracked as anxiety crept in. "Don't worry. There's no risk involved."

But Olivia remained unmoved. She didn't bother responding, instead turning to Isabelle. "Let's go home now."

With that, Olivia led Isabelle out of the car and into another, leaving Liam behind.

Oliver couldn't contain himself any longer and turned around, trying to reason with Liam. "Mr. Blackwood, Ms. Sinclair is beautiful, no doubt, but there are plenty of stunning women out there. Look how she treats you. No respect whatsoever. You need to stand your ground. Don't let her walk all over you. Love shouldn't make you lose your senses."

Liam's patience snapped. In one swift motion, he grabbed Oliver by the collar. "Who put these ridiculous ideas in your head?"

Oliver, suddenly uncertain, lowered his head and mumbled, "I just picked it up from TV dramas. But I swear, I only have your best interests at heart."

Sebastian quickly intervened, sensing the tension. "Mr. Blackwood, he's young and inexperienced. He was only trying to protect you."
###Chapter 407

Liam released Oliver's collar, his voice dropping to a grave tone. "I get it. But don't ever say that again. I know damn well I don't deserve her. No wonder she treats me like this."

Oliver opened his mouth to argue, but Sebastian shot him a warning look, silently telling him to back off.

Despite Oliver's usual composure, something about Olivia always managed to rattle him, making him uncharacteristically agitated. Still cautious of Liam's temper, Oliver asked carefully, "Mr. Blackwood, should we head back now?"

Liam shook his head, his voice heavy with resolve. "No. I'm not going anywhere."

He turned to Sebastian with determination. "Start the car. We're following her."

Olivia had no idea Liam would trail her all the way home. Once inside, she busied herself in the kitchen, preparing dinner for Isabelle. As she carried the dishes out, a servant approached, murmuring about unexpected guests.

Confused, Olivia stepped into the living room—only to freeze at the sight of a familiar figure lounging on her sofa. Annoyance flared instantly, her voice icy. "What are you doing here? Get out."

Liam was on his feet in a heartbeat, crossing the room in long strides. He caught her wrist, his grip firm but gentle. "No. I'm not leaving."

Olivia's expression hardened. "This is my house, Liam. I have every right to kick you out. I get that you want to apologize, but you've done enough. The past is over. I'm moving on. If you keep stalking me, you're just making things worse."

Emotion tightened Liam's throat, but he refused to let go.

"You've got it wrong. I'm not just here for you. I'm here to protect you and Isabelle. I know you don’t care about gossip, but she’s just a kid. If rumors start spreading in high society, what do you think will happen to her? Do you really want to be forced to live abroad forever?"

Olivia's gaze flicked to Isabelle, her chest tightening. After a beat, her tone softened slightly. "I understand what you're saying. But that doesn’t change the fact that I don’t want my life disrupted. You know what I mean."

Liam didn’t argue. Instead, he released her wrist and walked over to Isabelle, crouching to her level. His voice was warm, and soon, Isabelle’s laughter filled the room. Watching them bond so effortlessly twisted something inside Olivia.

After a pause, Olivia took her seat at the table and said coolly, "I only made enough for Isabelle and me. There’s nothing for you."

Liam remained unfazed. "That’s fine. I’m not here to eat. I just want to be with you both during dinner."

But Isabelle, ever thoughtful, didn’t hesitate. She asked a servant for an extra bowl and carefully scooped some of her food for Liam. "Mommy’s cooking is too good not to share! You have to try it!"

Olivia sighed. "Isabelle, if you keep giving your food away, you’ll go hungry."

With a bright smile, Isabelle shook her head. "Mommy, I know you’d never let that happen."

Liam couldn’t help but chuckle as he ruffled her hair. "Isabelle really is the sweetest girl in the world."

Despite her reluctance, Olivia couldn’t resist Isabelle’s pleading eyes—or Liam’s quiet presence. She called for the servant to prepare a few more dishes.

As they waited, Liam did something unexpected.

He removed his mask.

###Chapter 408

Olivia's eyes widened in surprise. "Aren't you worried about being recognized?" she asked, glancing around the dining room. Even within the safety of her own home, Olivia couldn't guarantee none of the staff would recognize Liam.

The pale complexion beneath Liam's ever-present mask made the scar across his cheekbone stand out starkly. Yet rather than detracting from his appearance, the mark added a dangerous allure to his already striking features.

Liam's icy gaze swept across the servants. "You hired these people yourself, Olivia," he said with quiet authority. "I trust your judgment. You wouldn't employ anyone who can't keep their mouth shut."

Those servants who did recognize Liam immediately averted their eyes, not daring to meet his piercing stare.

Little Isabelle, however, studied Liam's face with open curiosity, her innocent gaze lingering on the scar.

Liam shifted uncomfortably under her scrutiny. He turned his face slightly, as if to hide the mark. "Does this scare you, Isabelle?" he asked carefully, keeping his tone light.

Isabelle shook her head vigorously. "No! There's a boy at my preschool who has a scratch on his arm from saving a puppy. He calls it his hero badge." She pointed at Liam's scar with a chubby finger. "So that must mean you're a hero too!"

Liam's chest tightened unexpectedly at her words. Olivia smiled softly and added more vegetables to Isabelle's plate. "Eat well, darling. The stronger you are, the less anyone can hurt you."

"I'll grow up big and strong!" Isabelle declared between bites. "Then I can protect you and Mr. Liam so no one bullies you ever!"

The clinking of silverware filled the comfortable silence that followed. For the first time in years, Liam felt an unfamiliar warmth spreading through him - the simple joy of shared company.

Before traveling to Newport to take control of Blackwood Enterprises, Olivia had one crucial matter to settle. She instructed Nathaniel to arrange a discreet meeting, insisting her name remain unmentioned.

Meanwhile, Victoria Ellington had been wrestling with growing guilt over her recent actions. News that Mr. Blackwood had left with Olivia that fateful night had sent her into a spiral of anxiety. But when the engagement was officially announced, some of her tension eased. It seemed her scheme had worked after all.

When Olivia made no move to confront her, Victoria gradually let her guard down. With the powerful Ellington family backing her, she felt untouchable. Who would dare challenge the Ellingtons?

Her lingering guilt had kept Victoria from picking fights with Daniel lately. So when he unexpectedly invited her to dinner, she accepted immediately, even allowing herself a rare smile. It had been ages since Daniel had asked her out.

Victoria dressed carefully for the occasion, arriving at the exclusive restaurant with anticipation. But instead of Daniel, she found Olivia waiting for her.

This wasn't the warm, accommodating Olivia she knew. The woman before her had eyes like shards of ice and a demeanor to match. As Victoria's smile faltered, Olivia remained unmoved.

Approaching with measured steps, Olivia offered a cold smile. "Mrs. Bennett, do you finally have time for that conversation we need to have?"

Victoria's shock quickly hardened into defiance. "I'm afraid not. I'm meeting my husband for dinner." She tilted her chin up. "Surely even you wouldn't interfere in a married couple's private time?"
###Chapter 409

Olivia's fingers clamped around Victoria's wrist with lightning speed, her grip like iron as she anchored the trembling woman in place. The warmth in her emerald eyes vanished, replaced by glacial determination. "Don't bother looking for Daniel. It was me who orchestrated this meeting under his name. I knew you'd never agree to see me otherwise."

Victoria's face twisted in rage, her voice a venomous hiss. "So you admit it! You've been scheming to steal my husband all along! How despicable!"

Olivia remained unshaken by the baseless accusation. "I initially planned to clarify that nothing exists between Daniel and me," she stated coolly, "But now I see it's pointless explaining to someone like you. Why should I care about your opinion? You'd better cooperate unless you want unpleasant consequences." As she spoke, several imposing bodyguards materialized from the shadows.

Though her face paled, Victoria attempted bravado. "You wouldn't dare! You know who I am - harm me and you'll never see daylight in Crestwood again!"

Maintaining her composure, Olivia tightened her grip and pulled Victoria deeper into the private dining area.

"I've met your mother Beatrice. She's a principled woman who values family above all. If I were to reveal your actions, I'm certain she'd support me. In fact," Olivia's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper, "she might even have you imprisoned for what you've done."

Victoria's confidence wavered, panic flickering across her features. She knew Olivia spoke the truth - her mother would never condone such behavior.

Desperate, Victoria forced a laugh. "Then take me to court if you're so confident! Let's see your evidence. I doubt you have any real proof."

"Proof?" Olivia's gaze sharpened like a honed blade. With a subtle gesture, she summoned a bodyguard who dragged forward a bound man. The restaurant staff continued serving as if nothing unusual occurred.

Victoria's eyes widened in realization - this entire establishment answered to Olivia. When the hood was removed from the captive's head, all color drained from her face.

The man immediately began babbling. "Madam Ellington, you must explain! You hired me! I'd never have dared act alone! The money's still in my account - the transaction records prove everything!"

Victoria's knees nearly buckled as her carefully constructed facade crumbled. Olivia signaled her men to escort the shaking woman into a private chamber where they forced her onto the cold marble floor.

Even in defeat, Victoria spat venom. "Olivia, I did it because I loathe you! You had no right to return. Did you think you could waltz back into my life and take everything? You're nothing but a gold-digging whore! Don't think I don't see how you eye Daniel!"

Her voice dripped with malice as she added, "Even with your so-called evidence, what can you do? Any action against me would make you just as guilty. We'll rot in prison together."

Instead of anger, a chilling smile curved Olivia's lips. "You misunderstand, Victoria. I've no intention of breaking the law," she purred. "I simply want you to experience exactly what you inflicted on me."

"You can't do this! Have you no humanity?" Victoria's voice trembled with genuine terror.

Olivia nearly laughed at the irony. The woman who showed no remorse for her cruelty now begged for mercy.

###Chapter 410

Olivia Sinclair's lips curled into a frosty smile as she gazed down at Victoria Ellington. "Clearly, I have more dignity than to stoop to your level," she said, her voice laced with biting sarcasm. "Your actions were despicable, and I refuse to debase myself like you."

Victoria gnawed at her lower lip, humiliation coloring her cheeks, yet she stubbornly clung to her twisted justification. "The man I chose for you was influential. I only wanted to keep you away from my husband. You have a child to consider, and your life isn't easy. Even if you remarry, your new husband would likely resent you. I was doing you a favor. You should be thanking me. Who else would want a woman like you?"

Olivia didn't bother entertaining Victoria's warped logic. She'd learned that arguing with someone like Victoria was pointless. The woman would never acknowledge her wrongdoing.

Olivia knew true justice wouldn't come through words, but by stripping away what Victoria cherished most. The door behind Victoria creaked open, revealing Daniel Bennett standing in the doorway. He'd been there all along, his eyes bloodshot, hands trembling with barely contained emotion.

A shiver ran down Victoria's spine as she sensed his presence. With a subtle nod from Olivia, the security personnel released their grip on Victoria. Whirling around, Victoria's face paled at the sight of Daniel - it was like a physical blow to her chest.

"When... when did you get here? How much did you hear?" Victoria's voice quivered, clinging to a fragile thread of hope.

In a frantic attempt to regain control, Victoria pleaded, "Whatever lies Olivia told you, don't believe them! I'm your wife - the one you should trust. She's just jealous and wants to destroy what we have. Can't you see she's manipulating you? Her intentions are far from pure!"

Daniel's expression darkened as he slowly shook his head, disappointment radiating from his every pore. "Olivia didn't say a word. I heard everything I needed to know directly from your own mouth."

Victoria's face flushed with a mixture of shame, fear, and desperation. Her eyes darted wildly before she swallowed her pride and crawled toward Daniel, clutching at his trousers.

"I've stood by your side all these years, Daniel," Victoria implored emotionally. "I've never bowed my head to anyone. I love you so much. What did I really do wrong? I'll apologize to Olivia. I'll make amends. From now on, I won't cause her any trouble. Can't we just move past this? For your sake, I'm willing to let it all go."

But Daniel's face remained clouded with disillusionment. He stepped back, evading her grasp.

"The truth is, I stayed with you not just because of family obligations. At first, I didn't have strong feelings for you, but I respected you. I admired your capability and intelligence."

He paused, his expression growing heavier with each word. "When I agreed to marry you, I committed to building a future together. Yes, I once loved Olivia deeply, but I accepted that chapter was closed, that there was no going back."

Daniel's voice softened slightly as he revealed his intentions. "Before everything fell apart, I was planning to take you on a trip. I knew Olivia's return had shaken you, and I thought getting away from Crestwood might help. I wanted to give you space, perhaps stay away until she left, to bring you some peace."

Victoria's eyes widened with disbelief and dawning regret. "That can't be true! I saw how restless you became after she returned. You couldn't sleep, started going out alone at night. You even changed your phone password. What were you hiding from me?"

The ghost of a sad, disappointed smile touched Daniel's lips as he spoke words that would haunt Victoria forever. "I remember your birthday comes exactly one month after your mother's..."
###Chapter 411

I had prepared for this moment weeks ago. Yes, I changed my phone's password recently, and I did mention it to you. But you were too obsessed with those old photos on my computer. You accused me of still holding onto Olivia, yet you didn't listen to a single word I said.

His voice remained steady as steel. "Those pictures are fragments of my past - memories of me, my sister, and Olivia. Not a single one shows just Olivia and me alone."

Olivia, standing nearby, nodded in agreement. "It's true. She never liked taking photos. If it weren't for Natalie's insistence, she wouldn't have appeared in any of them."

Victoria's face contorted, her forced smile dissolving into ugly tears. "No! That's impossible! Are you telling me I've been battling a phantom - an imaginary rival all this time? I refuse to believe you're completely over Olivia! Unless you swear it, put it in writing, make it legally binding. Then maybe I can pretend none of this ever happened."

Victoria's voice cracked with desperation, edged with hysteria. Daniel's expression turned to stone, his patience exhausted. "I'm done explaining," Daniel declared, his tone leaving no room for argument. "Believe what you will. My decision stands."

He produced a folded document from his jacket pocket and tossed it at Victoria's feet. Her eyes bulged when she read "Divorce Agreement," feeling the ground give way beneath her.

"Never!" she shrieked, stumbling forward. She clutched at Daniel's sleeve. "We can't divorce! Our marriage has been flawless. Your family adores me, mine worships yours. This can't be how it ends!"

"When we married, all of Crestwood celebrated. You can't be this cruel, Daniel! What will society say about me if we divorce?"

Victoria's entire body trembled with panic, but Daniel's face remained impassive. Seeing her grip slipping, Victoria played what she believed was her trump card.

"If your family finds out, they'll never allow this. Your parents made it clear - only the man married to me can inherit the Bennett fortune. Without my support, you'll be completely disinherited, Daniel."

Victoria expected this threat to shake him, but instead, Daniel's gaze turned arctic. He wrenched his arm free, his voice rising with finality. "Let me make this perfectly clear, Victoria. I have zero interest in the Bennett legacy. If you think you can manipulate me with that, you're sorely mistaken. Even if I'm cast out of my family, this divorce will happen. Let's end this with some dignity. Don't make it uglier than it needs to be."

He paused, his tone resolute. "And don't waste energy worrying about Olivia. I'm leaving Eldermere tomorrow, and my destination is no longer your concern."

"No!" Victoria screamed, lunging for Daniel as he turned away. Blind panic surged through her as she tried to physically restrain him, but Olivia intervened, signaling for others to hold Victoria back.

Victoria's anguished wails echoed through the room as Daniel disappeared from view. Her strength spent, she collapsed to the floor, utterly broken. Olivia stepped forward, her voice like shards of ice. "How does it feel, Victoria?"

Victoria's tear-streaked face twisted with venom. "Happy now, Olivia? I knew it! There's something between you and Daniel. He's leaving me because of you!"

Olivia tsked, her words precise and cutting.

"Perhaps your marriage had cracks, but have you ever considered why it shattered? You blame everyone but yourself. Honestly, is this what you want - desperately clinging to a man who doesn't want you?"
###Chapter 412

Victoria's eyes flashed with uncertainty before hardening into pure venom. "Don't pretend you're superior, Olivia! If you're so mighty, kill me now! Do it! Because if you don't, I swear I'll destroy everything you love. You should have rotted overseas! Why did you return? You're disgusting, and that wretched daughter of yours is no better."

Olivia's expression turned glacial, her gaze piercing through Victoria like shards of ice. "Then perhaps I've been too lenient with you," she said, her voice sharp enough to cut glass. "Victoria, do you truly believe this is the extent of my capabilities?"

Still sprawled on the floor, Victoria let out a bitter laugh. "Prove it then! I've already lost Daniel - I have nothing left to lose."

A knowing smirk played on Olivia's lips as she deliberately ignored the challenge. Without another word, she turned on her heel and exited the room.

In the adjacent chamber, a cluster of journalists stood trembling, their cameras shaking in sweaty palms. These were the very reporters Victoria had hired to tarnish Olivia's reputation.

Olivia crooked a finger at one particularly eager-looking man. He scurried forward, his smile oozing false charm. "Ms. Kensington, everything will be handled exactly as you requested."

Olivia gave a curt nod. "You recorded everything?"

"Every damning word," the reporter confirmed with relish. "I can edit the footage to show Victoria as an unhinged woman obsessed with her husband's imagined infidelities. We'll portray her mental deterioration - how she kept Daniel prisoner in their home. Every woman who ever spoke to him will appear as another victim of her paranoia."

He paused, his grin widening. "Given the Ellington family's prominence, this scandal will dominate headlines for weeks. My colleagues are already prepared to run identical stories - Victoria's reputation will be ashes by morning."

A cold chuckle escaped Olivia's lips, her eyes devoid of warmth. "You seem quite experienced at character assassination. How many lives have you ruined with your little 'stories'?"

The reporter remained unfazed. "Ruined? Hardly. If these people didn't provide the material, I wouldn't have a job." His smug expression made Olivia's skin crawl.

Her mocking smile turned predatory. "How would you like it if someone dug up all your dirty secrets and splashed them across every tabloid? Would that be... newsworthy enough for you?"

The color drained from the reporter's face, his confidence evaporating.

Before he could stutter a response, Olivia waved a dismissive hand to her security team. "Remove him. And ensure he never works in this city again."

The man was dragged away, his pathetic whimpers echoing down the corridor. The remaining reporters stood frozen, barely daring to breathe.

Olivia sank onto a plush sofa, massaging her temples. "You all have the footage?"

After an awkward silence, one brave soul spoke up. "We understand perfectly. The truth about today's events will be reported. The entire city will know."

"Excellent." Some tension left Olivia's shoulders. She instructed her team to maintain surveillance on Victoria. This wasn't cruelty - it was necessity. Victoria wouldn't be going anywhere until this matter was settled.

###Chapter 413

Victoria Ellington remained under armed guard until dawn finally broke.

When released, she massaged her aching wrists while storming out of the restaurant, venom dripping from her muttered curses.

"What absolute nonsense! Olivia, I thought you were some powerful businesswoman. Clearly, you lacked the backbone to truly harm me. You'd better hope our paths never cross again. This time you let me go, but mark my words - I'll never show you such mercy."

Victoria raced home in a panic upon hearing Beatrice was there. Tears streaked her flushed cheeks as she burst through the grand foyer, desperately calling for her mother.

"Mother! Daniel's been ensnared by that scheming witch! He's demanding a divorce!" Victoria wailed dramatically. "She came to humiliate me, then had me imprisoned all night! I thought I'd die without seeing you again!"

As the Ellington family's cherished only daughter, Victoria had been raised with strict discipline yet remained the undisputed golden child. Never in her privileged life had she endured such indignities.

Beatrice doted on Victoria excessively. The younger woman fully expected her mother to crush Olivia without hesitation. In Victoria's mind, Olivia would soon find herself exiled in disgrace, utterly defeated.

Spotting Beatrice, Victoria dissolved into fresh sobs and rushed toward her.

But Beatrice turned with an expression like carved ice, her eyes devoid of maternal warmth.

Before Victoria could react, Beatrice's palm connected sharply with her daughter's cheek.

"Victoria, I've indulged you far too much," Beatrice snapped. "You've lost all moral compass. What happened to everything I taught you about proper conduct?"

Clutching her stinging face, Victoria stared in wounded disbelief. "Mother! How could you? What did I possibly do to deserve this?"

Furious, Beatrice produced her phone. The screen displayed a viral video showing Victoria and Daniel's explosive public argument at an upscale restaurant.

The raw footage lacked context but spoke volumes. The comment section overflowed with thousands of reactions.

"Is that Victoria Ellington? From the governor's family?"

"Exactly! The deputy governor's spoiled daughter. Can you believe how she behaves in private? Poor husband."

"Is she deranged? Publicly accusing her husband of infidelity like that. Frankly, I pity the man."

"Well, he's no saint either. He clearly doesn't make her feel secure."

Opinions varied wildly - some shredding Victoria's reputation, others offering weak defenses. While not quite a full scandal, the social media storm was gaining dangerous momentum.

Victoria, accustomed to unquestioned superiority, couldn't tolerate being common gossip fodder. The very idea of ordinary people dissecting her private life was intolerable.

"That conniving bitch!" Victoria shrieked, hurling the phone against marble floors without regard for Beatrice's mounting fury. The older woman's disappointment radiated palpably.

"I've heard the full truth today," Beatrice said coldly. "Now I want your version. Explain yourself, Victoria. Why would you do this?"

A flicker of guilt crossed Victoria's face before her trademark arrogance reasserted itself. "Mother, I'm your only daughter. Who else would you have if not me?"
###Chapter 414

"I said leave!" Beatrice Ellington's voice cut through the air like a whip.

Victoria Ellington stood frozen, her face pale with shock. Without another word, Beatrice stormed out and began barking orders at the staff to pack Victoria's belongings.

The world seemed to tilt beneath Victoria's feet. Her hands trembled uncontrollably before she finally collapsed into a chair, utterly defeated. She couldn't comprehend where she'd gone wrong.

All she'd wanted was to protect her marriage, to remove the threat to her husband. Was that so terrible? Why did everyone act like she was the villain? She couldn't accept that she was wrong.

Emotions threatened to drown her as she struggled to breathe. With sudden determination, Victoria pushed herself up and marched out of the study.

She found Beatrice in the hallway, still directing servants to remove her possessions, her expression carved from stone. Though Beatrice's anger burned bright, part of her didn't truly want her daughter gone. Yet seeing Victoria's cold, unyielding stance, she hardened her resolve.

Victoria needed this harsh lesson before she crossed a line that couldn't be uncrossed. The thought of what might happen otherwise made Beatrice's stomach twist.

"Remove every last item!" Beatrice's voice rang out sharply. "I want no trace of her remaining in this house by sunset! Where she goes matters not to me. After her actions, she wouldn't dare show her face here regardless. I no longer claim her as my daughter!"

Beatrice's tirade was abruptly cut off as someone shoved her violently from behind, sending her sprawling to the floor with a startled cry.

Meanwhile, Olivia Sinclair studied Liam Blackwood's stubborn expression. She understood he wouldn't budge. Drawing a deep breath, she felt her patience wearing dangerously thin. The time for games had passed.

"So you refuse to leave?" Olivia's voice was tight with tension. "Fine. Then Isabelle and I will be the ones to go."

Liam remained silent, but the hurt in his gaze spoke volumes.

Sebastian Montgomery cleared his throat awkwardly. "The situation is this, Ms. Kensington: Mr. Blackwood currently has no alternative accommodations in Crestwood."

"What?" A disbelieving smirk tugged at Olivia's lips. "That's the most ridiculous claim I've ever heard."

Wiping sweat from his brow, Sebastian continued with grave sincerity.

"Mr. Blackwood has been disowned by his own family. While the Blackwoods wouldn't dare punish him directly, they're determined to uncover his true identity. Maintaining the persona of Mr. Jack is his only protection. He can't risk losing it. Currently, every hotel and rental agency in Crestwood has standing orders from the family. Any new lease must be reported immediately to the Blackwoods. They've arranged surveillance on all new tenants."

Olivia's scowl deepened. "Do you take me for a fool? How could Victor possibly manage that? Thousands of people rent properties daily."

Sebastian's expression turned deadly serious. "Yet he has. You should understand the Blackwood family's influence in Crestwood. Don't believe me? Test it yourself. Victor likely knows everything about you by now."

Olivia found herself momentarily speechless. While Victor might be incompetent in business, she couldn't deny his extensive network of informants. After all, he'd been the one to orchestrate Liam's downfall years ago. The man clearly had resources.

Still, Olivia refused to yield. "That still doesn't explain why Liam must stay with me. I've crossed the Blackwoods. Why should that be my problem?"

At that moment, Isabelle, who had been quietly observing, suddenly spoke up. "Mommy, the lady who took me mentioned her son's last name was Blackwood."

"Blackwood?" Olivia's head snapped toward Liam, confusion written across her face.

Liam looked almost defeated as he explained, "Richard has an illegitimate son with his mistress, though the boy has never been particularly capable."
###Chapter 415

Olivia's emotions twisted into knots. She couldn't find a single logical reason to refuse Liam. Then little Isabelle tugged at her sleeve with pleading eyes. "Mommy, he's so pitiful. If you don't let him stay, he'll have to sleep outside in the cold. He won't have a proper bed or warm meals."

Olivia shot Liam an exasperated look. "Do you really think manipulating a child is the right way to get what you want?"

Liam shook his head firmly. "I'm not lying. This is my reality. I can't leave Eldermere right now. If I'm not on the streets, where else would I go? We're not in Valtierra anymore. Things are complicated here. If I reveal my identity now, Victor will stop at nothing to destroy me."

Olivia arched a skeptical brow. "Seriously? With all your resources, you're afraid of Victor?"

A frustrated sigh escaped Liam's lips. "It's not him I'm worried about. It's the power behind him."

Olivia's mind raced as she recalled whispers about Victor's shadowy benefactor—a figure notorious for pulling strings from the darkness. Despite years of effort, Victor had never managed to break free from this puppet master.

The room fell into heavy silence, tension thickening the air.

Oliver couldn't contain himself any longer. "Mr. Blackwood, we should leave! Can't you see they don't want us here? You risked everything for this woman's daughter, and now she doubts your motives. Why stay? She's made her ingratitude clear."

Liam's gaze turned glacial. "Oliver, I've tolerated your behavior because of your youth. But this is your final warning. Speak like that again, and I'll have no choice but to send you away."

Oliver's face crumpled. "Mr. Blackwood, what about your promise—"

"Enough!" Liam stood abruptly, fury radiating from him. "Yes, I made promises. But you've tested my patience repeatedly. Why should I continue to indulge you?"

Olivia watched the exchange with growing confusion. Why was Oliver so hostile toward her? Had she somehow provoked him? In the past, she might have cared. Now, others' opinions meant nothing.

"You can stay," Olivia declared coolly. "But don't disrupt my life or Isabelle's." Her tone left no room for negotiation.

A flicker of pain crossed Liam's eyes before vanishing. "Understood," he murmured.

Just then, Olivia's phone buzzed. It was a message from Beatrice, who'd gotten her number during their last encounter.

The text read: Olivia, are you free? We need to talk.

Olivia frowned. Was this about what happened with Victoria? Yet everything she'd heard about Beatrice suggested this wasn't her style.

When no immediate reply came, Beatrice sent another message: Please don't be alarmed. I'm not here to cause trouble. I know what happened between you and Victoria. I've asked her to leave my home. But I owe you a personal apology.

Olivia was stunned. Beatrice had actually kicked Victoria out? Despite her strict upbringing, Victoria's jealousy had spiraled out of control.

A sigh escaped Olivia's lips. She felt no sympathy for Victoria, but her heart ached for Beatrice. Rumor had it Beatrice had raised Victoria alone since her husband's tragic death years ago.

Despite the toll of balancing career and single parenthood on her health, Beatrice had paved a golden path for Victoria—selecting a suitable fiancé Victoria actually liked, hoping for her happiness. Yet everything had unraveled so spectacularly.

###Chapter 416

Olivia hesitated as Beatrice's messages kept coming. The older woman's persistence was wearing her down. "I'm truly sorry to disturb you," the latest text read. "I just feel so unsettled. My daughter's behavior is entirely my fault, despite everything I tried. If today isn't convenient, perhaps we could meet another time? I'd like to apologize face-to-face."

As a single mother herself, Olivia understood Beatrice's struggles all too well. That shared experience softened her heart toward the woman.

Finally, she typed a reply: "I can meet today. Send me the location."

Olivia left without telling Liam or Isabelle. Given Beatrice's delicate situation, she preferred to handle this alone. The last thing she wanted was to complicate matters further. But fate had other plans - Oliver intercepted her at the elevator.

"Wait!" Oliver blocked her path, his expression stormy. "We need to talk."

Olivia recognized that stubborn set to his jaw immediately. Not in the mood for another confrontation, she forced a polite smile. "Another time, Oliver. I have an appointment."

But Oliver matched her step for step as she tried to walk away. "I don't care if you're busy," he insisted. "I'll follow you all day if I have to. This can't wait."

Olivia exhaled sharply. Since when had Liam become so patient with rebellious teenagers? The boy's determination was impressive, if misguided.

Seeing no escape, Olivia stopped abruptly, her expression turning frosty. "Five minutes. And I have something to say to you too."

Oliver crossed his arms, chin jutting defiantly. "Stay away from Liam. He's already promised to someone else - someone perfect for him. If you actually care about him, you'll back off." His voice took on a lecturing tone. "Our former boss arranged the marriage before he died. She saved Liam's life. They're meant to be together. If not for you, Liam would be married to her right now."

Olivia's eyebrows shot up. She hadn't realized Liam's reputation extended so far internationally. Then again, it made sense - women had been drawn to him since childhood. But an arranged marriage? That was new information.

An odd tightness formed in her chest as she processed this. Her voice turned arctic. "Listen carefully - I never asked for his attention. If you can convince him to leave me alone and return to this perfect woman, by all means do so. The problem isn't me clinging to him. I've told you before - all I want is peace."

Oliver flushed, momentarily speechless. When he found his voice again, it came out strangled. "Then... then refuse him properly! Your half-hearted rejections just encourage him. Consider this your warning - stay away."

Olivia's patience shattered. She stepped forward, forcing Oliver back several paces. "I don't owe you explanations," she said icily. "If you're so confident, make him leave me alone. Why should I be the one rejecting him? This isn't my problem to solve."

Oliver's hands clenched into fists. "Just wait until my lady returns! She'll deal with a homewrecker like you properly!"

His words hung in the air between them as Olivia turned on her heel and walked away, her back rigid with suppressed anger. The elevator doors closed on Oliver's furious expression, leaving Olivia alone with her turbulent thoughts.
###Chapter 417

Olivia simply chuckled. "Fine, I'll be waiting."

With that, she turned on her heel and walked away, her designer heels clicking against the marble floor.

Fuming, Oliver stomped his foot like a petulant child. As he spun around, his blood ran cold when he spotted Sebastian watching him from across the courtyard. The older man's icy gaze was like a bucket of cold water dumped over his head, instantly extinguishing his bravado.

Oliver ducked his head and tried to scurry away, but Sebastian's long strides caught up to him effortlessly. "I warned you not to interfere between Liam and Olivia," Sebastian said, his voice dangerously calm. "Why did you confront her like that?"

"Fine! As long as she stays away from Liam, I won't bother her again," Oliver muttered, avoiding Sebastian's piercing stare.

Meanwhile, when Olivia arrived at the Ellington estate, she was struck by the eerie silence that greeted her. The palatial mansion stood empty despite its grandeur, not a single servant in sight.

The Ellington wealth didn't surprise Olivia. Their fortune had been established generations before Beatrice's time, built on legitimate business ventures and old money.

Just as she began to feel uneasy, the butler materialized silently and gestured for her to follow. They moved through the cavernous halls, their footsteps echoing in the oppressive silence. When they reached the vast living room, the butler vanished without a word, leaving Olivia completely alone.

Frowning, Olivia checked her watch. After fifteen minutes with no sign of Beatrice, she pulled out her phone. "Where are you? Should I come to you?" she texted.

The reply came moments later: "Second floor study." Olivia hesitated, then climbed the sweeping staircase.

What she found on the second floor landing made her blood freeze. Beatrice lay motionless on the marble floor, a dark pool of blood spreading beneath her head.

Olivia's hands shook as she fumbled for her phone. Before she could dial, strong hands grabbed her from behind, wrenching her arms painfully.

Victoria appeared at the top of the stairs, her shriek piercing the silence. "Olivia! How could you push my mother?"

Olivia's breath caught in her throat as she stared up in disbelief. "What are you talking about?"

Victoria threw herself dramatically beside Beatrice's prone form. "Mom! Wake up! Please!" she wailed, tears streaming down her face. "You only wanted to apologize, but she demanded you disown me! When you refused, she pushed you!"

Olivia's stomach churned as realization dawned. The texts hadn't come from Beatrice at all. The horrifying truth hit her - had Victoria staged this entire scene? Had she harmed her own mother?

"You monster!" Olivia gasped. "She's your mother! How could you?"

Victoria's face twisted with rage. "Liar! You're the one who attacked her! You couldn't accept her apology and lashed out!"

Olivia took in Victoria's perfectly staged performance, understanding the depth of the trap. Forcing herself to breathe evenly, she said, "This won't work, Victoria. The police will see through your flimsy story. Is ruining your life really worth this petty revenge?"

The air crackled with tension as the two women locked eyes, one calculating, the other horrified. Somewhere in the mansion, a clock ticked ominously, marking the seconds until the real truth would be revealed.
###Chapter 418

Olivia's breath hitched as Victoria advanced toward her. With a single flick of her wrist, Victoria summoned the guards, who roughly forced Olivia onto the cold concrete floor. The sharp click of Victoria's stiletto echoed through the room as she pressed down mercilessly on Olivia's delicate fingers.

White-hot pain exploded through Olivia's body, making her vision blur. Her porcelain skin turned ashen as the unbearable pressure continued, her hand going frighteningly numb beneath Victoria's designer shoe.

After an agonizing eternity, Victoria finally lifted her foot, her crimson lips curling in cruel satisfaction. "Who mentioned anything about authorities?" she purred, tilting her head like a predator examining its prey.

Releasing Olivia's mangled hand, Victoria crouched low, gripping Olivia's chin with manicured nails. She drank in the tears welling in Olivia's striking emerald eyes, savoring each shudder of pain.

"You took my mother from me," Victoria hissed, her voice dripping with venom. "Did you truly believe you'd walk away unscathed? This estate will be your gilded cage until you draw your last breath." A cold laugh escaped her lips. "Let's see how captivating you find yourself without an audience."

With a careless gesture, Victoria motioned to the guards, who dragged the trembling Olivia away. The basement swallowed her whole - a lightless void where even her own limbs disappeared in the oppressive darkness. Sinister shapes lurked in the corners, whispering of unspeakable torments to come.

Olivia flexed her injured hand, wincing at the stiffness. She swallowed back tears, forcing steady breaths through cracked lips. Victoria had clearly lost all reason - a dangerous woman with nothing left to lose.

Hours bled together as Olivia racked her brain for potential rescuers. Only one name surfaced - Liam. Her last flickering hope.

The rusty hinges screamed as the door swung open. Victoria's silhouette filled the doorway, something glinting in her hand. Blinding light flooded the space, making Olivia recoil with a pained gasp.

Even in her disheveled state, Olivia's ethereal beauty remained untouched. This realization made Victoria's blood boil. "How fortunate for pretty little things like you," she sneered, twirling a water bottle between her fingers. "Men would move heaven and earth for that face. Pity it won't save you now."

"What do you want?" Olivia croaked, her throat raw from thirst and disuse.

Victoria's smirk widened as she shook the tantalizing bottle. "Thirsty? Beg for it. On your knees, where you belong. Apologize for murdering my mother."

Olivia shut her eyes against the temptation. During her captivity, Victoria had sent dry biscuits - cruel mockeries of meals without water to wash them down. The thirst had become a living thing, clawing at her throat, but she refused to break.

A weaker woman might have crumbled. Olivia bit her tongue until copper flooded her mouth, using the pain to sharpen her resolve.

"You want my surrender on camera," Olivia rasped. "Evidence for your twisted game. Tell me, Victoria - who put you up to this? Who's pulling your strings?"
###Chapter 419

The smirk faded from Victoria's lips. She twisted the cap off the bottle and deliberately poured every drop of water onto the floor in front of Olivia. The liquid splashed against the tiles, not a single drop reaching Olivia's parched lips. "Go on. Get on your knees and lick it up," Victoria sneered, her voice dripping with venom.

Olivia didn't move. She didn't speak. Her gaze remained fixed on Victoria—cold, unyielding, like ice. Though exhaustion had drained the color from her face, her eyes burned with quiet defiance. Victoria's lips twitched into a reluctant smirk.

"Why?" Victoria mused, tilting her head. "Why would someone still care about you in this state? It's pathetic, really. He can't take you with him. I've set my terms. If he wants you, he has to reveal himself—his true self."

She leaned in closer, her voice lowering to a conspiratorial whisper. "Others might be blind, but I'm not. I used my mother's connections to dig up his secrets. Mr. Jack? The underworld kingpin? The man everyone fears?" She laughed, sharp and mocking. "He's the one who murdered his own mother and was cast out of the Winslow family. That's right—Liam Blackwood."

Olivia's chest tightened. Victoria had uncovered Liam's past. But it wasn't surprising—Victoria had always been resourceful when it came to destruction.

"Now," Victoria continued, her eyes gleaming with cruel amusement, "do you think he'll choose you… or himself?"

Olivia closed her eyes briefly, exhaling slowly before meeting Victoria's gaze again. "His choice doesn't matter. My fate was sealed the moment you decided to play god. You claim Liam killed his mother, but that's a lie. What you've done, though—that's real. If you kill me, you're only signing your own death warrant. I won't be the only one walking into the dark."

Victoria flinched. Fear flickered in her eyes—just for a second—before it was swallowed by fury. She still cared about consequences. She had regretted it, in that split second when she pushed Beatrice down the stairs. But regret had been drowned out by rage.

If only Beatrice had loved her more. If only she hadn't chosen to discard her.

After Olivia returned, Victoria had made sure to remind Beatrice of Olivia's past with Daniel—always in that detached, innocent tone. "You and Daniel are married," she'd say, feigning concern. "Shouldn't you focus on your own life? I doubt Daniel would cheat. And even if he did, it's all in the past. Isn't it a bit excessive to dwell on it?"

She'd tilt her head, playing the voice of reason. "If there was ever anything between Daniel and Olivia, it would've happened long ago. Besides, Daniel barely socializes anymore. What's really bothering you? Have you forgotten how to forgive? Where's your trust? All my teachings… wasted. You've disappointed me."

Those words haunted her when she saw Beatrice lying at the foot of the stairs, bleeding but still breathing. In that moment, Victoria's mind had gone blank. She didn't call for help. She didn't try to save her. She just… watched.

Later, the regret came—not for killing her mother, but for ruining her own life. Convinced she had nothing left to lose, Victoria had lured Olivia here. How foolish Olivia had been, thinking the Ellingtons would ever want her back.

But then Liam had threatened to call the police—right in front of her.

Panic surged through Victoria. She wasn't ready to face the consequences. Not yet.

Olivia, however, remained eerily calm.

Victoria's patience snapped. She crouched down, gripping Olivia's chin with bruising force. "I've changed my mind," she hissed. "You should die. Why did you even come back? You ruined everything—my life, my marriage. So just die for me!"

She forced a handful of pills into Olivia's mouth. Olivia choked, trying to spit them out, but her fingers trembled too weakly to help. When Victoria saw her swallow, a slow, satisfied smile spread across her face.

###Chapter 420

Five minutes later, Olivia's vision blurred. The light drained from her sapphire eyes.

"Olivia, bark like a dog," Victoria commanded with venomous satisfaction.

Olivia obeyed mechanically.

Victoria exhaled sharply, satisfaction warring with vindication in her voice. "Every penny spent on this was worth it."

She regretted wasting the serum on Olivia. Had she known its potency, she would've used it on Daniel. Then perhaps he wouldn't have dared mention divorce.

The Montgomery family butler rushed downstairs. "Miss, that man agreed to your terms - but only if you release Olivia immediately. Otherwise, he threatens police involvement."

"Would he truly risk exposure for her?" Victoria's jealousy flared. How did this worthless woman inspire such loyalty from Liam? Olivia didn't deserve such devotion.

After a calculated pause, Victoria's lips twisted. "I'll record a video. Then release her. Make him wait five minutes."

In the Montgomery grand hall, Liam sat rigid on the velvet sofa, radiating lethal energy. His glacial gaze promised violence.

Though equally furious, Sebastian maintained composure. "Mr. Blackwood, we must exercise caution here!"

"Don't concern yourself," Liam replied, his voice dangerously calm.

Sebastian doubted Liam's restraint. Where Olivia was concerned, the ruthless CEO became unpredictable.

Sebastian sighed inwardly. The Montgomerys had crossed a line. After tonight, Crestwood would no longer be safe for them.

Victoria entered with armed guards dragging Olivia. The captive kept her head bowed, tangled chestnut hair obscuring her face.

Liam's gut twisted seeing Olivia's torn dress. What horrors had she endured? Normally so articulate since recovering her voice, she remained eerily silent.

He surged forward, only to be blocked by guards. Liam's glare could've frozen hell. "Explain this."

Victoria smirked, arms crossed. "I brought your pet. Now honor your promise. Give me your word - how else can I trust you?"

Liam's fists clenched, veins protruding. "State your terms."

"Escort me to the airport immediately. My flight's booked. Once I'm airborne, she's yours." Victoria pressed a blade to Olivia's throat. "Try anything, and my men have orders to kill her rather than surrender her."

The knife bit into Olivia's pale skin, drawing blood. Yet she showed no reaction, her vacant stare fixed on nothing.
###Chapter 421

The crimson blood dripping down Olivia's neck sent Liam into immediate panic. His breath hitched as his pupils dilated with horror. "Fine! I accept your terms!" he barked, voice cracking. "Sebastian! Arrange everything now! Get her to that damn plane immediately!"

"Right away, sir."

Victoria hesitated for a heartbeat, casting one last triumphant glance at the scene before scurrying after Sebastian.

Liam's attention snapped back to Olivia. The blood continued its slow trail down her pale skin, yet she remained eerily silent - a broken porcelain doll with vacant eyes. A cold realization slithered down his spine.

"Olivia?" His voice trembled.

Before she could react, the blade at her throat pressed deeper, drawing another thin line of red. The bodyguard's warning was clear.

Liam's jaw clenched so tight his teeth ached. Rage and helplessness warred within him, turning his vision red at the edges. Why couldn't he protect the one person who mattered?

The clock ticked with agonizing slowness. Twenty minutes stretched into what felt like hours before Sebastian's text arrived: "Victoria's on the plane to Montecarlo. Watched her board myself. Should we have her intercepted, Mr. Blackwood?"

A mirthless smile twisted Liam's lips as he typed his reply: "Let her think she's escaped. Track her every move. The game isn't over."

At the signal, the guards released Olivia as promised. The moment their hands withdrew, she crumpled to the floor like a marionette with severed strings.

As the room emptied, Liam surged forward, gathering Olivia's limp form into his arms. "Olivia? Sweetheart?" His fingers trembled as he examined the wound - superficial, thank God, but the vacant stare in her eyes chilled him to the bone.

She didn't respond. Didn't blink. Just existed, breathing but not living.

"Get her to Mercy Hospital! And someone call Oliver Hart immediately!" Liam roared.

At the hospital, the lead physician's brow furrowed as he reviewed the test results. "We're dealing with an advanced neurotoxin - something I've never seen in clinical practice. Don't worry, we'll assemble our best specialists immediately."

Liam could only nod mutely before returning to the private ward.

Olivia had been propped up against the pillows, her gaze fixed on some distant point beyond the window. The color had returned to her cheeks, but her eyes remained disturbingly empty.

A nurse waved a penlight before those unblinking eyes with no reaction. It was as if Olivia's soul had vacated her body, leaving behind only the shell.

Then Liam saw it - the faintest twitch between her brows. He dismissed the medical staff with a curt gesture. "I'll watch over her."

Alone in the hushed room, Liam sat vigil beside the bed. Outside, the wind whispered through the trees. Golden sunlight filtered through the leaves, painting dappled patterns across the sterile white sheets.

How long had it been since they'd shared a quiet moment like this?

###Chapter 422

Liam's voice softened as he gazed into the distance. "When we were children, I often sat alone like this. You'd always find me. I told you to leave me alone, that you were bothering me."

He chuckled at the memory. "You promised not to speak, just to sit quietly. The truth is... I never minded your company. My temper was short back then, and I feared lashing out at you. But secretly... I always looked forward to your visits."

"Liam..." Olivia whispered suddenly, interrupting his thoughts.

Liam froze mid-sentence, his breath catching. Slowly, he turned to face her.

Olivia's eyes held a new awareness as she repeated, "Liam."

His heart pounded violently against his ribs. With trembling hands, he reached for hers. "Olivia? Can you understand me? Do you know where you are?"

Instead of answering, she kept repeating his name in that same flat, mechanical tone.

A storm of emotions raged within Liam. The specialists at Mercy Hospital had warned him Olivia might remain completely unresponsive before treatment. Yet here she was, acknowledging his presence.

For days, Olivia had existed in a detached state, oblivious to the world around her. The medical team had tried every possible treatment, but nothing seemed to penetrate the fog surrounding her mind.

"These new designer drugs are unpredictable," the lead neurologist had admitted, rubbing his temples in frustration. "We've stabilized her physically, but the psychological effects... That's another matter entirely."

The doctor had suggested familiar surroundings might trigger memories. That's why Liam had made the decision to bring Olivia home.

Little Isabelle had been ecstatic at the news of her mother's return. The child had spent days preparing - arranging flowers, drawing welcome signs, even selecting her favorite stuffed animal to share.

The moment the car pulled into the driveway, Isabelle came sprinting from the house, her golden curls bouncing with each excited step. Liam was just helping Olivia from the vehicle when the small tornado of energy collided with them.

"Mommy! Mommy!" Isabelle cried, throwing her arms around Olivia's waist.

Olivia staggered slightly but instinctively caught the child, her hands automatically steadying the little girl. Liam's eyes widened in shock. At the hospital, Olivia had recoiled from every human touch.

Perhaps the mother-daughter bond could penetrate where medicine had failed. For the first time in weeks, Liam felt a flicker of genuine hope.

Even at her young age, Isabelle sensed something was different. She pulled back slightly, studying her mother's face with concern. "Why won't you talk to me, Mommy? Did I do something wrong?"

Her small fingers plucked anxiously at Olivia's sleeve. "Please say something. Anything."

Liam knelt beside them, smoothing Isabelle's hair. After a moment's hesitation, he chose honesty. "Sweetheart, Mommy's sick right now. It's like when you have a bad cold and don't feel like talking. She needs time to get better."

Isabelle nodded solemnly, though confusion still clouded her innocent face. She didn't fully understand, but she trusted Liam completely. "Okay," she whispered. "I'll be extra quiet, like when Grandma has her headaches."

The child's simple faith nearly broke Liam's heart. He pulled both his girls into a careful embrace, praying this homecoming would work the miracle the hospital couldn't.
###Chapter 423

Isabelle's gaze flickered nervously before she seized Liam's hand, tugging him closer. She pressed near, her breath warm against his ear as she whispered.

"Will you stay? I know a bad man hurt Mommy and made her sick. Bad people always hurt my mommy, and I can't stop them." Isabelle's cheeks flushed pink as she ducked her head. "When I grow up, I'll protect her myself. I won't need anyone's help."

Liam's chest constricted. Such courage in one so young, bearing burdens no child should. He pulled Isabelle into a fierce hug. "You're amazing, Isabelle," he murmured. "This is my fault. I won't let anything happen to you or your mom again."

Isabelle tilted her head, confusion knitting her brow. "But...you don't have to. Mommy says only family protects each other forever. You're her friend. You only have to protect her sometimes."

Pain lanced through Liam. "Your mom said that?" His voice tightened. "She called me just a friend? Did she mention anything else about me?"

Isabelle blinked, his words clearly puzzling her.

"It's alright," Liam said, masking his hurt. "Take your mom inside to rest now."

Nodding, Isabelle led Olivia away by the hand. Olivia took a few steps, something unreadable flashing in her eyes. She glanced back at Liam, noting his slumped shoulders before turning away.

Liam watched them go, loneliness crashing over him. For a fleeting moment, he'd considered using Olivia's amnesia to rebuild their connection.

But the thought sickened him. It would be manipulation, taking advantage when she was vulnerable. When her memories returned, she'd despise him. All he could do was be there—no expectations, no conditions.

Meanwhile, Liam pursued Victoria relentlessly. He mobilized every resource. The woman had vanished the instant she left the country.

That evening at a high-society gathering, Liam came face-to-face with a legendary investigator—a man whispered to find anyone, anywhere.

They said he could track a target with just a description. But the man was eccentric, refusing jobs unless the mood struck, regardless of payment.

Tonight, the investigator signaled hired girls to flirt with Liam, proposing toasts. Years of social events had built Liam's tolerance; liquor barely affected him.

After several bottles, Liam remained steady while the investigator grew impatient. With a wave, he summoned a girl.

She sauntered over, hips swaying. The investigator whispered in her ear. Nodding, she gave Liam a sultry look. "Such a fine figure," she purred, sidling close. "Why hide behind that mask? Let us see your handsome face."

Her fingers brushed the mask's edge—

Liam shoved her violently. She crashed to the floor, wailing theatrically.

He didn't blink. His gaze turned arctic. "Seeing my face means death. That's the rule." His icy words aimed at the investigator. "Still curious?"

Liam wouldn't be here if he didn't need this man's skills to hunt Victoria down—to make her pay for what she'd done to Olivia.
###Chapter 424

Liam Blackwood took one look at the man's arrogant stance and knew he wasn't worth another second of his time. Without hesitation, he turned toward the exit, ignoring the man's sour expression.

But the stranger wasn't about to let Liam leave so easily. He blocked the doorway with his body. "What the hell? Is this how you ask for favors?"

Sebastian Montgomery had reached his limit. Rising from his seat, he cleared his throat with a tight smile. "Sir, you seem confused. Mr. Blackwood is here to propose a business partnership, not beg for assistance. He's more than capable on his own, but time is valuable. And might I suggest - humility suits you better."

The alcohol had clearly impaired the man's judgment. "Partnership? Bullshit!" he slurred. "You need me, not the other way around. Big shot outside, but crawling to me now. I was just testing your patience, and you're already failing. So much for the legendary Liam Blackwood."

Sebastian's smile vanished instantly. "Do you have a death wish?" His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper.

The man flinched slightly, but then a spark of realization lit his eyes. With newfound bravado, he lifted his chin. "You're searching for someone," he taunted, his words dripping with malice. "You've told me everything. She must be important to you. Just wait until I find her first - you'll never see her again."

Liam let out a cold laugh, his gaze turning glacial. "Do you honestly think I wouldn't destroy you?" As he advanced, his voice remained eerily calm, the lack of emotion more terrifying than any outburst.

The air in the room grew thick with tension, the silence so heavy it made skin prickle.

Suddenly, a commotion erupted at the entrance. The sound of clattering dishes and angry shouts cut through the tension. A drunk's slurred curses added to the chaos.

Liam's brow furrowed in irritation.

Sebastian moved immediately. "Mr. Blackwood, allow me to handle this disturbance," he said firmly.

Turning back to the man, Liam allowed a chilling smile to play on his lips. "You think finding her first is a threat? Let's see who reaches her faster."

The man's bravado faltered under Liam's icy stare. He stammered, unable to maintain eye contact.

At the doorway, Sebastian's shocked voice cut through the noise. "Miss Kensington? What are you doing here?"

Liam's threatening demeanor vanished as he rushed toward the commotion. He arrived to find Olivia Sinclair standing bewildered amidst the chaos, with Sebastian already intervening with the drunken troublemaker.

A nearby waiter was frantically explaining the situation to anyone who would listen.

Moments earlier, the waiter had been clutching his tray tightly when Olivia suddenly moved toward the room's entrance. Their collision sent a cascade of wine glasses shattering to the floor, drenching the drunkard's clothes.

The waiter's rapid apologies flew toward both Olivia and the soaked man, his words tumbling over each other in panic. He thought the matter was settled.

But the drunkard wouldn't relent. Ignoring the waiter, perhaps because of Olivia's delicate appearance, he demanded she apologize on her knees and clean his trousers personally.

Olivia, however, stood her ground, unwavering.

###Chapter 425

The drunkard's crude insults escalated, his words becoming increasingly vulgar with each passing second. Had Sebastian not stepped in when he did, the intoxicated man might have dragged Olivia into his private booth by force.

Liam's jaw clenched so tightly it could have shattered diamonds as he observed the scene, his rage simmering just beneath the surface.

In the ensuing chaos, the man who had started the confrontation saw his chance to slip away unnoticed.

"Are you injured anywhere?" Liam's voice carried urgent concern as he grasped Olivia's hand, his piercing gaze scanning every inch of her for signs of harm. The absence of visible wounds brought him only partial relief.

Completely misreading the gravity of the situation, the drunkard snapped irritably, "Who the hell are you? You know this woman? Perfect. She ruined my custom-made trousers worth thirty grand. Either she pays up now or joins me for drinks to make up for it."

Olivia, who had remained expressionless throughout the ordeal, took an almost imperceptible step closer to Liam. After their recent time together, Liam had become attuned to even the most subtle shifts in Olivia's demeanor.

Liam's expression turned glacial. Without uttering a word, he exchanged a meaningful glance with Sebastian.

Sebastian immediately understood, signaling the security team to deal with the troublemaker.

The drunkard's bravado faltered as curses spilled from his lips, barely masking his growing panic. His loud protests drew attention from passersby and neighboring patrons, yet none intervened. Most recognized the significance of Liam's distinctive mask and wisely chose not to provoke his wrath.

After several ice-cold buckets of water were dumped over his head, the drunkard finally regained some semblance of sobriety.

Recognition dawned on the drunkard's face as he took in Liam's imposing figure. His voice trembled as he stammered, "This is my first time here - I didn't know the rules. I had no idea she was with you. Please, allow me to make amends."

With that, the drunkard began frantically slapping his own face. When he noticed Olivia's continued displeasure, his panic intensified.

Liam's smile was arctic as he addressed the shaking man. "You seem confused about who deserves your apology."

The drunkard scrambled to turn his groveling attention toward Olivia. "Miss, I was an absolute fool not to recognize your... connections. Please accept my most humble apologies for this misunderstanding."

The stark contrast between how he addressed Liam versus Olivia was impossible to miss.

Sebastian, unable to contain his disgust any longer, interjected sharply, "If you're apologizing, then specify exactly what you did wrong."

The drunkard looked genuinely perplexed. "I told you, I'm new here. I didn't recognize this gentleman. I don't know how things work in this place."

Driven by outrage, Sebastian delivered a sharp kick to the drunkard's shin. "You left the waiter alone but targeted her. Would you have harassed her if she hadn't been protected? Is that how you operate?"

The drunkard spat back, "No respectable woman comes to a place like this! They're all here looking for trouble, trying to seduce men. This one just got lucky catching his eye."

Liam rose to his full height, a dangerous smirk playing on his lips as he took Olivia's hand and approached the cowering man. "Look closely and understand this..."
###Chapter 426

Olivia Sinclair is neither some disposable trinket nor my possession, as you so crudely suggested. That's Olivia Sinclair you're disrespecting. If you're curious about her, by all means, look her up. With her skills, she could eliminate you before you even blink.

The intoxicated man scrambled for his phone, fingers trembling as he typed Olivia's name. His face turned ashen as the search results loaded.

Liam Blackwood's voice cut through the tension. "She happens to own this establishment. If you think the women here aren't good enough for you, what does that say about your own worth? I never want to see your face in Midnight again. Get out."

But Liam wasn't finished teaching this lesson.

Settling beside Olivia on the plush sofa, Liam took her cold hand in his. "Watch how I deal with trash like this."

Olivia turned her face away, exhaustion weighing down her words. "Take me home, Liam."

At her quiet plea, the ice in Liam's eyes melted instantly. "Of course. Let's go."

After ensuring Olivia was safely secured in the car, Liam delayed their departure. With a sharp gesture, he summoned Sebastian Montgomery.

His voice was steel. "Explain this to me. I specifically ordered your team to monitor her every movement. How was she left unattended? How did she end up here alone?"

Sebastian looked equally baffled. The agents assigned to Olivia were seasoned professionals. Mistakes like this never happened. Given Olivia's importance to Liam, this oversight was unacceptable.

A shadow crossed Sebastian's face as realization dawned. Though he remained silent, his troubled expression told Liam everything.

"Get me back to the estate immediately. And have the family physician waiting when we arrive," Liam commanded.

After personally seeing Olivia settled in her rooms, Liam stormed into his study. Oliver Hart knelt in the center of the room, his face a mess of bruises and defiance.

Sebastian sighed internally. Oliver had been recruited by the real Jack. Despite his youth, Oliver had always been fiercely loyal and capable. Liam had previously overlooked his mistakes with mere warnings, never resorting to physical discipline. But this time, Oliver had gone too far. Liam's men had been instructed to teach him an unforgettable lesson.

Despite the swelling, Oliver's injuries weren't serious. Liam stood motionless, his handsome features carved from marble, radiating enough cold fury to freeze the room. Oliver couldn't hold back his tears any longer. He felt utterly betrayed. Everything he'd done had been for Liam's benefit. Why couldn't Liam see that?

The words burst from Oliver's bruised lips. "I don't understand! Olivia's nothing but a liability! Instead of supporting you, she keeps getting drugged and manipulated. How much longer will you keep cleaning up her messes? You haven't even noticed what Evelyn's been going through because of your obsession!"

Liam crossed the room in three strides, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "You keep mentioning 'Miss.' Tell me, Oliver - who exactly are you serving? Me or her? I've made my decision. You're dismissed. From this moment, you're free to follow your precious 'Miss' wherever she goes. But let me be crystal clear - cross me again, and there won't be a next time."

Oliver's jaw clenched, torn between rage and heartbreak.
###Chapter 427

"Did Olivia tell you I took her to Midnight? That's absolute nonsense! I can't stand her presence, but I wasn't trying to create trouble for you. She kept obsessing about you, so I just let her go. I didn't care enough to stop her. I wasn't the one who dragged her there."

Liam's hands clenched into fists. Every muscle in his body tensed with the urge to punch Oliver right between his smug eyes.

"You might not have physically forced her," Liam growled, his voice dangerously low, "but you gave her directions and didn't even assign someone to protect her! What if she'd been hurt? She's barely recovered. How was she supposed to navigate there alone? She could hardly form coherent sentences last week."

"Bullshit!" Oliver snapped back, his face flushing red. "I've been monitoring her recovery closely since she returned. The drugs may have affected her mind, but her speech is perfectly functional. How else would I know she was searching for you, huh?" Oliver scoffed, crossing his arms. "She pretends not to hear anyone but you. It's all an act. Her selective hearing drives me insane."

Sebastian and Liam exchanged startled glances.

"Wait. Are you saying she's regained cognitive function?" Sebastian interrupted sharply.

"Damn right she has!" Oliver practically shouted. "She's not fully recovered yet, still a bit spacey, but she's far from the zombie-like state she was in days ago."

Liam had heard enough. Without another word, he turned sharply and strode from the study.

Sebastian started to follow but paused, turning back to face the defiant Oliver. "I'm telling you the truth. It was me who uncovered your involvement. Olivia was nearly assaulted at that club. If we hadn't found her in time—" He let the ominous implication hang in the air.

Taking a measured breath, Sebastian continued, "You've served Liam for years. Haven't you realized by now that he has zero romantic interest in Miss Sinclair? He's merely honoring Mr. Jack's dying wish. If you truly care about her wellbeing, stop forcing this connection. On the drive back, I asked Olivia why she came. She remained completely silent. I genuinely thought she'd lost her voice."

Oliver listened, his expression shifting from defiance to confusion, then finally to resignation. A mixture of frustration and sorrow colored his voice as he whispered, "Sebastian, I don't want to leave Liam's service. I want to stay by his side. The man's a genius. I could learn so much from him."

Sebastian shook his head, his features hardening into an unyielding mask. "I warned you before that Olivia is Liam's only non-negotiable boundary. Your flight's arranged. I'm sending you back to Valtierra tonight. Stay with Miss Sinclair and make sure Mr. Blackwood never sees your face again."

Tears welled in Oliver's eyes, but he blinked them away and gave a stiff nod.

Meanwhile, Liam found Olivia in her sunlit chambers, absorbed in reading while wearing a delicate nightgown. Golden sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting an ethereal glow around her. She looked like a Renaissance painting come to life—regal, untouchable, and breathtakingly beautiful. There was an almost divine quality to her stillness that made one hesitate to interrupt.

Liam slowed his approach, drawn to her like a moth to flame. "Reading in direct sunlight will strain your eyes," he murmured softly. "Shall we move to the rose garden?"

His tone was gentle, the way one might speak to a frightened child. Olivia didn't verbally respond, merely shaking the leather-bound volume in her hands.

Curiosity piqued, Liam moved closer and recognized it as a diary, its cracked spine and yellowed pages suggesting it was at least fifteen years old.

As Liam carefully opened the fragile pages, revealing elegant feminine script, he worried his facial scars might unsettle her. With deliberate slowness, he removed his mask.

While Liam was engrossed in deciphering the faded handwriting, he felt the lightest touch against his cheek. Olivia's fingertips were tracing the jagged scars along his jawline with unexpected tenderness.
###Chapter 428

Liam dodged her touch, his cheeks flushing. "It's not exactly pleasant to look at," he muttered, fingers fumbling with the mask. Just as he raised it to his face, Olivia caught his wrist. Her piercing gaze held his, searching and intense. "Does it still pain you?" she asked softly.

His heart clenched painfully, eyes burning with unshed tears. Liam shook his head slightly. "Not anymore," he managed, voice rough with emotion. "The worst is over."

Olivia gave a small nod, understanding flashing in her eyes. With a subtle gesture, she urged him to keep reading.

Settling back into the chair, Liam turned the pages, the quiet room filled only with the whisper of paper. It wasn't until midway through that he realized the entire journal centered around him.

The early entries were mundane - daily routines, simple observations, no mention of anyone, not even the Blackwood family. Then his name began appearing.

One passage stood out: "Today Henry introduced me to his grandson. He said Liam was handsome and kind, that we'd get along perfectly. But Henry was wrong. Liam can't stand me. The moment our eyes met, his expression darkened. He told me to leave, said I was stealing his grandfather's affection. Called me a spoiled brat. My heart aches."

Liam's chest tightened with guilt and unexpected amusement. Yes, that had been him. Back then, with Margaret's poisonous words in his ears, he'd been convinced Olivia was nothing but trouble, a threat to his place in his grandfather's heart.

During their first meeting, Liam had scowled at Olivia's presence. Yet as days turned to weeks, she became like family. Then something deeper blossomed - feelings Liam had struggled to acknowledge, fearing they were improper.

What he hadn't known was that Olivia felt the same. She'd carried a secret affection for him. But their shared pride and sensitivity created walls of misunderstanding between them.

Liam wanted to read further, but Olivia's hand closed over his, stopping him. Apparently she only wanted him to see this particular page. Confused, he looked up. Her intense gaze bore into him, silently demanding he acknowledge what lay between them.

He hadn't realized she still carried hurt from those early days. "I'm sorry," Liam said sincerely, voice thick with regret. "I never meant to push you away. My stubborn pride... I should have been honest from the beginning. Can you forgive me now?"

Olivia remained silent, simply releasing his hand.

Respecting her quiet, Liam continued reading. The following pages contained only trivial daily accounts, none of the deeper emotions young Olivia had clearly hidden. Perhaps she too had considered her feelings inappropriate, too private even for her personal journal.

A pang of sadness struck Liam. He turned to Olivia, taking her hand again, his voice earnest. "Would you believe me if I told you I've loved you for years?"

Olivia didn't respond, but her lashes fluttered slightly. They sat in comfortable silence for nearly half an hour before exhaustion finally claimed Olivia. As her head nodded forward, Liam carefully gathered her into his arms and carried her to bed. He tucked the blankets around her with gentle precision, then turned to leave.

Suddenly, in that twilight between sleep and waking, Olivia's hand shot out, grasping his. "Liam... stay," she murmured, voice barely audible.

Emotion surged through him, his heart pounding. "I'm here," he whispered, squeezing her hand. "I won't leave. I'll stay right here with you." Liam settled on the edge of the bed. Slowly, Olivia's breathing evened out as she drifted back into peaceful slumber.
###Chapter 429

The days passed in quiet rhythm, and Olivia's health showed remarkable improvement. Her attitude toward Liam softened noticeably, a change he accepted with quiet understanding. After all, he knew the weight of his past mistakes.

As for the search for Victoria, Liam's network remained frustratingly silent. The peaceful days stretched on, yet Liam couldn't shake the feeling that this calm was merely the eye of the storm.

One crisp morning, a flustered maid came rushing to find Liam. "Mr. Blackwood! It's Miss Kensington - something's happened! Please come quickly!"

Alarmed, Liam followed the maid at once.

When they reached Olivia's chambers, the room stood empty save for the sound of running water from the adjoining bathroom. Liam shot a questioning look at the maid, who shifted uncomfortably before explaining.

"Miss Kensington insisted on bathing alone today, though we normally assist her. I waited just outside in case she needed anything. Then I heard her cry out."

The maid twisted her apron nervously. "She must have fallen, but she refused any help. I didn't dare enter uninvited - you know how she gets. Little Isabelle is too young to be of assistance. I had no choice but to fetch you."

Liam's gaze moved to the fogged glass door, already feeling the beginnings of a tension headache. "Wait here. I'll handle this." He approached the door and knocked firmly but politely. "Olivia? Are you hurt? Can we send someone in to check on you? I'll stay right out here."

Silence.

His pulse quickened as he knocked harder. "Olivia! Answer me!"

When no response came, Liam's protective instincts overrode propriety. He forced the door open, steam billowing out to reveal Olivia collapsed on the wet tiles. The sight of crimson streaks against white porcelain sent a jolt through his system.

Steeling himself, Liam grabbed a nearby towel and approached. As he moved to lift her, Olivia weakly pushed against his chest.

"Let me help you up," Liam murmured, keeping his voice calm despite the hammering in his chest. "The floor's too cold, and we need to tend to that cut." When her resistance faltered, he added, "Please."

With visible effort, Olivia finally allowed him to assist her to her feet, though she shrugged off his supporting arm as soon as she was steady. Liam quickly wrapped a dry towel around her shoulders, his eyes dropping to the nasty-looking gash on her leg - superficial but alarming.

Kneeling, Liam began tending to the wound with practiced hands. Olivia watched him with an unreadable expression before finally breaking the silence. "Have you been... looking after me like this all along?"

Liam glanced up, surprise flickering across his features. "Are you feeling more like yourself?" he asked carefully.

Olivia turned her face away, color rising in her cheeks. "I must have slipped. Strangely, the fall seems to have... cleared my mind." She swallowed. "I'm sorry for the trouble. I panicked earlier."

"Don't apologize," Liam said, returning his attention to her injury. "This is exactly where I should be."

She nodded, then suddenly sneezed.

###Chapter 430

Liam stood, wrapping Olivia securely in a cashmere throw before retrieving a hair dryer. "Turn over," he murmured, his voice low and soothing. "Let me dry your hair properly."

Olivia complied without protest, settling onto her stomach as instructed. Liam's fingers moved gently through her damp strands. The quiet hum of the appliance filled the luxurious bedroom.

Though conscious, Olivia still battled waves of dizziness. Within minutes, she succumbed to exhaustion right before Liam's watchful gaze. He didn't disturb her. Before exiting, he issued strict instructions to the housekeeper. "Monitor her condition closely. If she shows any discomfort or needs anything, attend to her immediately."

The staff couldn't help their admiration. "Sir, your devotion to Miss Kensington is remarkable," the housekeeper ventured. "Any woman would be enchanted by such care. She may appear reserved, but we've all seen how her eyes soften when you're near. We're all hoping for an announcement soon."

Liam's lips twisted wryly. "Let's not discuss this again," he cautioned. "And certainly not within Olivia's hearing." His voice dropped lower. "She wouldn't appreciate such speculation."

Meanwhile, across the continent, Victoria Ellington struggled to maintain her cover. Constantly shifting locations to avoid Liam's search teams while securing basic necessities had taken its toll. The risk of discovery loomed large, yet she'd devised a scheme. Reaching out covertly to Evelyn Hartley, she set her plan in motion.

Evelyn initially doubted the message's authenticity. Victoria's sudden overseas disappearance made no sense. "Stop wasting my time," Victoria snapped impatiently. "Unless you enjoy living in Olivia's shadow forever?"

Three days later, explosive headlines surfaced. Olivia stood accused of involvement in a high-profile murder. The allegations stemmed from a single, damning video.

The footage showed Olivia beside Beatrice Ellington's bloodied form. Clever editing obscured Olivia's expression, creating the illusion she'd returned to a crime scene. Beatrice's social prominence ensured the story spread like wildfire, forcing the temporary closure of Olivia's prestigious auction house.

Adding fuel to the fire, Victoria made a tearful public statement. She claimed to have been traveling abroad for solitude, unaware of her mother's tragic fate until news reached her. On camera, Victoria appeared shattered - her face ashen, body trembling violently. No viewer could suspect the grieving daughter had actually orchestrated her own mother's demise.

Police soon arrived to question Olivia. Liam provided clear explanations, but investigators remained skeptical. "Why no police report?" they pressed. "Even if Miss Kensington was held captive, why not notify authorities immediately upon her release?"

A tension headache pulsed behind Liam's temples. Involving law enforcement or revealing his true identity had been the last thing on his mind while focused on Olivia's wellbeing.

Officials placed them under surveillance pending further investigation, severely restricting Liam's movements regardless of his intentions.

Olivia mirrored his frustration. "This is my fault," she lamented. "Had I been more cautious, we wouldn't be trapped like this. The truth will surface eventually, but until then, my reputation's ruined and business halted. Worse, if your identity becomes known, all those years of secrecy will be for nothing."

A warm glint entered Liam's eyes. "Are you... concerned for me?"

Olivia suppressed an eye roll. "Call it what you will. I simply owe you. Without your intervention, my situation would be far more dire." She rose abruptly. "I need rest." With that, she retreated to her chambers.

###Chapter 431

Sebastian opened his mouth to speak but was immediately silenced by Liam's piercing glare. "Mr. Blackwood," Sebastian began, massaging his temples, "Olivia is right. Your safety must come first. If your true identity is exposed, the Blackwood family won't show any mercy."

Liam adjusted his position with effortless grace, crossing his long legs. His fingers tapped a steady rhythm against the sofa's armrest. The afternoon light framed him perfectly, making him look like a painting come to life.

"Didn't you notice anything strange about her?" Liam's voice carried an edge of suspicion. "A drug that potent would have side effects." His tone grew firmer. "Sebastian, whatever I decide to do next, don't interfere—and don't contact Oliver behind my back. I know you've been speaking with him. What exactly did he say? The truth."

Sebastian exhaled deeply before responding. "He confirmed there are definitely side effects. But unless she chooses to reveal them, no one will ever know."

Liam's eyes darkened as he processed this information. "If she doesn't want to tell me, I won't force her. Just make sure no one troubles her further."

Meanwhile, in her bedroom, Olivia was battling a crippling headache. Curled into a tight ball, her clothes clung to her skin, damp with cold sweat. The door hadn't fully closed when Olivia entered, giving Isabelle a glimpse inside.

"Mommy?" Isabelle's voice was barely above a whisper as she gently pushed the door open. When she stepped inside, her small frame froze at the sight of Olivia trembling violently on the bed.

"Mommy! Mommy!" Isabelle dropped her stuffed bunny and rushed to Olivia's side, tears streaming down her cheeks. "Mommy, what's wrong? Does it hurt? Let me help!" Olivia managed to open her eyes, her heart breaking at the sight of Isabelle's tear-streaked face.

Olivia tried to lift her hand to wipe away Isabelle's tears but found herself too weak. "Don't cry, sweetheart. I'm okay." She forced a smile, unaware how strained it looked.

Isabelle, terrified, began backing away, her sobs growing louder. "Mommy, don't worry! I'll get Liam! He'll make everything better!"

"Isabelle Sinclair!" Olivia's sharp tone stopped her daughter in her tracks. "Stay here! I'll be fine!" The command came out harsher than intended.

Reluctantly, Isabelle returned to her mother's side. "But I hate seeing you hurt. Liam's amazing. He stayed with you when you were sick last time, and you got better because of him. If I call him now—"

Olivia sighed softly, running her fingers through Isabelle's hair. "I'm really okay, sweetie. I just need rest. If you stay and sleep with me, the pain will go away."

Isabelle nodded solemnly, kicking off her shoes and climbing into bed. Olivia leaned down to press a gentle kiss to her forehead. Holding her daughter close, Olivia felt the pain begin to fade, soothed by Isabelle's warmth.

But Isabelle, ever curious, couldn't stay quiet for long. "Mommy, do you dislike Liam?" she asked hesitantly.

Olivia paused. "Not exactly."

"Then do you like him? You never treated other men the way you treat Liam."

"I treat Liam the same as everyone else," Olivia countered.

"Different. You're more patient with Liam," Isabelle observed with innocent wisdom. Olivia was momentarily speechless. After a beat, she sighed. "Did Liam put you up to this?"

###Chapter 432

Olivia Sinclair shook her head earnestly. "No, I saw it on television. But if you'd rather not watch it, I won't insist."

Liam Blackwood smiled softly and stroked Isabelle's hair. "Let's get some rest now," he murmured in that velvet voice that always made her feel safe.

What Olivia didn't know was that Sebastian Montgomery had been standing just outside the door, eavesdropping on their entire exchange. His fingers had hovered over the doorknob before pulling back at the last second. The sudden vibration of his phone shattered the tense silence.

Liam moved swiftly down the hallway before answering. The voice that greeted him dripped with poisonous sweetness.

"Liam darling, I bet you didn't anticipate being caught in my web again." Victoria Ellington's laugh was like shattering crystal. "Time to choose - reveal who you really are or get Olivia out of Eldermere. Because if you don't... well, let's just say peace will become a foreign concept for her."

Her confidence was absolute. She'd covered every track, disposed of Beatrice Ellington's body with clinical precision. The police would find nothing, leaving Olivia as the only viable suspect. Otherwise, Liam would have involved authorities by now.

His knuckles turned white around the phone, eyes hardening into glacial shards.

When silence stretched too long, Victoria's tone shifted. "Or... here's an alternative. Publicly clear my name regarding the Kensington estate incident. Swear you won't oppose me again. In return, I'll drop all legal actions." Her voice turned saccharine. "What do you say, darling?"

Liam's response could have frozen hell over. "You murdered your own mother, Victoria. Do you truly believe there won't be consequences?"

Her laugh was razor-sharp. "Consequences? Please. Your sins eclipse mine tenfold. Didn't you end Margaret Winslow's life? That's why you're hiding behind this pathetic alias."

"We are nothing alike," Liam countered icily. "You think these baseless accusations intimidate me?"

Victoria's smirk was audible. "I've laid out your options. Choose wisely, darling. My patience wears thin. You have seventy-two hours."

The moment the call ended, Nathaniel Bradford materialized at Liam's side. "Sir, we've traced the post's origin. It came from Evelyn Hartley."

Liam's lips curled in dark amusement. "If Victoria had recruited someone competent, I might be concerned. But Evelyn? That's almost insulting."

Nathaniel's brow furrowed. "Nevertheless, Mr. Blackwood, the situation escalates. Multiple factions are investigating us covertly. If this continues..."

"I'm aware," Liam interrupted, massaging his temples. "We proceed with caution."

Meanwhile beneath the scorching midday sun, Sebastian Whitmore cornered Evelyn in her sunroom. As she lounged with a bowl of grapes, his sudden grip sent her sprawling. The porcelain bowl shattered against marble tiles, fruit scattering like blood droplets.

Evelyn rose slowly, eyes flashing. "Have you lost your mind, Sebastian?"

His expression was thunderous. "Enough games. What have you done? Don't play the fool with me."

She glanced away, fingers twitching. "I haven't broken any laws."

When Sebastian twisted her wrist sharply, she gasped. "That hurts!" Her protest came with practiced doe-eyed innocence.
###Chapter 433

Sebastian Whitmore's grip tightened around Evelyn Hartley's wrist, crushing both her pretense and any hope of escape. His eyes burned with cold fury.

"You made a vow," he hissed. "On your knees before Olivia Sinclair, swearing never to harm her again. Yet here we are. If this blows up, even I can't protect you."

Evelyn's face twisted. "Olivia? Since when do you say her name so tenderly?" She wrenched her arm free. "I'm your fiancée! You should be exposing her flaws. The truth hurts, doesn't it? Never forget—you owe me everything."

Rising slowly, she cradled her abdomen with a grotesque smile. "Especially now that I'm carrying your child."

Sebastian paled. "That's impossible."

Her smirk widened. "Your family demands heirs. I'm the perfect broodmare. Treat me well, or I'll paint Olivia as a homewrecker to your parents. Right now, I have no power... but as Mrs. Whitmore?" She leaned in, breath hot against his cheek. "I'll destroy her."

His jaw clenched. "You think I'll let that happen?"

"Stop me if you can." With a mocking curtsy, Evelyn sauntered away, leaving Sebastian slumped against the wall, drowning in regret.

This was his fault. That damned cruise.

Months ago, a reckless getaway had turned into a nightmare. Drugged amidst illegal dealings, Sebastian became blackmail fodder—compromising photos, fabricated scandals. They'd planned to kill him until Evelyn appeared like a specter, "saving" him from exposure.

He'd woken with her in his bed, paparazzi swarming. The Whitmores—led by patriarch Marcus Whitmore—demanded restitution. A marriage to salvage their reputation. A severance from Olivia.

Sebastian had complied, believing Evelyn held his debts. But doubts festered. Was she truly his rescuer? Investigating that night proved impossible now. With her pregnancy claim, Evelyn wielded nuclear leverage.

His phone burned in his pocket. Olivia's number flashed in his mind. But shame paralyzed him. How could he face her after this betrayal?

Meanwhile, Liam Blackwood prepared to address the media storm. Across town, Victoria Ellington swirled her wine, smug.

"Love makes men weak," she purred to her reflection. "Only the heartless rise."

The press conference loomed—a ticking bomb set to detonate all their lives.
###Chapter 434

Just as Victoria was about to put down her phone, it rang. Hesitating for a moment, she debated whether to answer. To her surprise, it was Daniel calling. Since their separation, Daniel had moved abroad, completely unaware of the ongoing Ellington family drama. His direct, no-nonsense tone pressured Victoria to finalize their divorce without delay.

Victoria's carefully constructed mask of indifference cracked at the urgency in his voice. A sudden wave of sorrow threatened to overwhelm her.

Irritation flared within her. Was Daniel that desperate to divorce her? Did he truly loathe her so much? Annoyed by his eagerness, Victoria lost her composure and lashed out sarcastically over the phone.

"Daniel, you're utterly spineless. Off gallivanting while Olivia suffers. Do you even know what she's going through?"

A tense silence followed before Daniel's concerned voice broke through. "What did you do to her?"

Victoria attempted to laugh, but tears betrayed her first. "Still pretending there's nothing between you two? Then why do you care so much about her?"

Daniel exhaled heavily, his voice thick with emotion. "Victoria, when I married you, all I wanted was a peaceful life together. But you've never trusted me. I did love you once—do you believe that?"

Those simple words nearly shattered Victoria completely. Regret stabbed at her heart. Perhaps things could have been different. But it was too late now—the damage was irreversible.

Steeling herself, Victoria shouted, "Stop lying to me! I see everything. You and Olivia are having an affair, aren't you? But it doesn't matter anymore. She'll get what's coming to her."

After hanging up, Victoria immediately texted Daniel a link to an online video. Within minutes, her phone exploded with frantic calls and messages from him. Without hesitation, she blocked his number.

Undeterred, Daniel called from different numbers, bombarding her with pleas. Each message she read only deepened her despair. He kept insisting nothing existed between him and Olivia, yet his excessive concern told a different story. Fine. From now on, she vowed to make both their lives hell.

Victoria typed another message, this time to Evelyn. "Can you contact that journalist we used before? I need him to run a story tomorrow claiming Olivia's been secretly seeing my husband. When I confronted her, she fought with my mother and pushed her down the stairs in my absence."

Evelyn replied casually at first, then paused. "Wait...did you know your mother actually died from a fall down the stairs?"

Victoria froze. "I didn't know. I made it up. The details don't matter—just have him report that. No more questions."

Evelyn sensed something amiss but held her tongue. Their temporary alliance had one purpose: to destroy Olivia. Nothing else was relevant.

The day of the press conference arrived swiftly. The venue attracted not just reporters, but a significant police presence as well.

Liam had organized this event without bothering to inform Olivia. As he left, Olivia remained secluded in her room, completely unaware of what was about to unfold.
###Chapter 435

Liam had ordered the household staff to have extra physicians on standby, ready for any medical emergencies. Just as he was preparing to depart, little Isabelle intercepted him in the hallway.

Clutching her favorite stuffed unicorn, Isabelle marched up to him with determination. "Are you going to punish the mean people who hurt Mommy? Take me with you! I can help!" she declared, waving her tiny fists with surprising ferocity.

For a moment, Liam was speechless. He knelt down and smoothed her golden curls. "Princess, I need you for a very special mission today. You must stay here and guard Mommy."

Isabelle's enormous sapphire eyes blinked rapidly. "Is there a bad guy in our house?" she whispered dramatically.

Liam chuckled softly. "No, sweetheart. Mommy isn't feeling well, and your hugs make her feel better."

Though she didn't fully understand, Isabelle nodded solemnly. Then suddenly, she motioned for Liam to bend down. Standing on tiptoes, she whispered in his ear, "Daddy...when you're here, Mommy feels better too. When I was napping with her, she kept saying your name in her sleep."

Liam feigned sternness. "Your mother's right. We really should limit your cartoon time."

With an indignant huff, Isabelle grabbed her toys and flounced toward the living room. "You're not fun anymore! I'm going to Mommy now!"

A fond smile tugged at Liam's lips as he watched his daughter skip away. The smile faded as she disappeared around the corner.

Sebastian voiced his concern quietly. "Sir, if your identity becomes public knowledge, you won't be able to remain here. Are you absolutely certain about this course of action?"

A shadow crossed Liam's face. "There's no alternative. I owe her everything. If this guarantees Olivia and Isabelle's safety, then I'm prepared to stay away forever."

Before leaving, Liam cast several lingering glances toward Olivia's bedroom door. The thought of never seeing them again was excruciating, but he'd run out of options.

At the press conference, Liam - now wearing a sleek black mask - took center stage. He revealed his true identity and publicly acknowledged his engagement to Olivia.

Evelyn had come expecting to witness Olivia's downfall. Her disappointment was palpable when the brunette failed to appear.

Sebastian Whitmore attempted to reason with Evelyn once more. "With all these rumors circulating, you need to clarify this was all a misunderstanding. Someone sent you that edited video to frame Olivia. You were manipulated, Evelyn. No one will blame you if you come forward now."

Evelyn shot him an icy glare. "Forget it. Olivia should have been destroyed, yet she dared humiliate me. I'll never forgive her!"

Sebastian gestured toward Liam. "You know exactly who he is. Do you understand the consequences of crossing him?"

Evelyn smirked and shrugged dismissively. "Why should I fear him? The Whitmore family backs me. What can one man possibly do?"

Sebastian's voice dropped to a grave tone. "This isn't a game, Evelyn. His influence runs deeper than you imagine. The Whitmores can't protect you from him."
###Chapter 436

"Seriously?" Evelyn tilted her chin up, studying the masked Liam with envy flashing in her eyes. "You heard him yourself. He just called Olivia his fiancée. Why would a man of his status pick someone like her? Even if it was pure chance, he could easily handle such minor issues. Why go through all this trouble?"

Sebastian shared her confusion. Having lost contact with Olivia recently, he was completely in the dark about the details. All he could do was worry and try to dissuade Evelyn from targeting Olivia.

At his wit's end, Sebastian blurted out the harshest words he could think of. "Evelyn, I swear if you keep this up, I won't marry you even if my grandfather disowns me."

Evelyn's expression flickered. Her hands clenched into fists on her knees, knuckles turning white. After a long, tense silence, she gave a bitter, mocking smile. "Fine. If you don't want me, someone else will. You're not the only eligible man in the Whitmore family."

Sebastian stared at Evelyn, stunned. She had seemed so devoted to him all this time. But now the truth was clear. All she cared about was status and power. She wanted a comfortable life, and it didn't matter who provided it.

That was exactly Evelyn's perspective now. After Liam used and discarded her, she realized love was meaningless and brought no benefits.

"Then we're done here." Sebastian composed himself, gave Evelyn one final icy look, and walked away.

Evelyn's fingers twitched. For a fleeting moment, she wanted to chase after him. But then the fury and resentment surged back, freezing her in place.

Meanwhile, the excruciating pain finally subsided, leaving Olivia exhausted and gasping for breath. This was the fifth attack today. Strangely, she felt slightly better afterward. Olivia lay still for ten minutes, gradually regaining some strength.

Just then, little Isabelle wobbled in, struggling to carry a basin of warm water. "Mommy, let me wipe your sweat," she chirped, tiny hands straining to keep the basin steady. Her earnestness was adorable yet heartbreaking.

Olivia's chest tightened. "Sweetheart, why don't you let the maids do that? You're too small."

Isabelle shook her head stubbornly. "But love is in the water! Mommy, if you use it, you'll heal faster!"

After freshening up, Olivia felt remarkably better. The pain had vanished completely. Was this improvement or something more ominous? She couldn't tell.

Feeling slightly stronger, Olivia managed to shower and change into fresh clothes. Isabelle danced around her mother, giggling with delight at seeing her up again.

During this cheerful chaos, Olivia suddenly thought of Liam. "Where's Liam?" she asked casually. "What's he been doing?"

The butler cleared his throat awkwardly. "I'm not entirely certain, madam. He left earlier. He did mention you shouldn't contact him unless it's urgent. Said he might be quite occupied."

Olivia nodded, deciding not to press further. As she recovered at home, she tried piecing together what had happened before she lost consciousness. Now feeling stronger, she was determined to get answers.

Olivia reached for her phone and saw breaking news. She opened it to find a live recording of Liam's press conference. She had no idea what it was about.

###Chapter 437

The barrage of reporters' questions hit Olivia Sinclair like a physical blow. "Did Olivia Sinclair actually murder Beatrice Ellington?" one journalist demanded. "You never reported her to authorities. Are you shielding her, or were you involved?"

"You claim she was framed. Then why no police involvement? And where's Beatrice Ellington's body now?"

"You're accusing Victoria Ellington of killing her own mother? But they were inseparable. How does that make sense?"

"Rumor has it Olivia interfered in Victoria and Daniel's relationship. Any truth to that? What do you know about it?"

Olivia's phone clattered to the floor, the screen shattering like her composure. She rose on unsteady legs, shoulders sagging under invisible weight. Never had she imagined Liam Blackwood would endure such public scrutiny without defending himself.

Emotions swirled violently in Olivia's chest. Part of her recoiled at his silent protection. The thought of him suffering for her crimes made her physically ill, though she'd never voice that truth. Instead, she convinced herself it was simply about avoiding further indebtedness.

With sudden determination, Olivia moved toward the door. Little Isabelle clung to her sleeve. "Mommy, please don't leave me! I'm scared you won't come back like before—"

Tears pooled in the child's wide eyes, threatening to overflow.

After a brief hesitation, Olivia arranged for Isabelle to accompany her. The moment they stepped outside, the girl began chattering excitedly.

"When Liam went to handle those mean people hurting you earlier, he wouldn't let me go. Said I had to stay and protect you instead. Are we going to punish them now?"

A lump formed in Olivia's throat. "Did he... say anything else?"

Isabelle shook her head vigorously.

Olivia exhaled slowly. "Sweetheart, from now on, I want you to tell me everything Liam says to you, understand?"

Though confused, the child nodded obediently.

At the press conference, Liam remained unshaken despite the explosive allegations. Methodically, he presented damning evidence accumulated over months. Eyewitness accounts and surveillance footage placed Victoria fleeing the Ellington estate on the day in question.

Victoria had erased all internal security recordings, but missed one critical external camera. While not definitive proof, the timestamped footage shattered her alibi of being abroad during her mother's death.

Previously, Victoria had sworn under oath she'd been overseas, completely unaware of events at the family home. Yet here was irrefutable video evidence of her departure mere hours after Beatrice's estimated time of death.

Most damningly, pharmacy records showed Victoria had purchased the exact neurotoxin found in Olivia's system—during her supposed trip abroad. The mounting evidence left the assembled reporters speechless.

Watching the broadcast, Victoria's triumphant smirk dissolved into horror.

Before today, Liam had always appeared cornered by her maneuvers. How had he amassed this arsenal of proof? And why had he waited until now to deploy it?

###Chapter 438

Olivia's mind raced as the pieces suddenly fell into place. Liam had orchestrated this entire scenario with meticulous precision. He'd bided his time, waiting for the perfect moment when all eyes were upon them. Using the court of public opinion as his weapon, he'd delivered a devastating blow that left her no room for counterattack. Though the sun still shone brightly overhead, an icy chill ran down Olivia's spine.

At that exact moment, Liam turned his gaze directly toward the camera. His dark eyes gleamed with predatory intensity, piercing through Olivia like a hawk spotting its prey. A wave of primal fear and unease washed over her.

She inhaled sharply, her nails digging into her palms as she clenched her fists. "Liam Blackwood," she whispered through gritted teeth, "you've sealed your own fate."

When Olivia and Isabelle arrived at the press conference venue, the place was already teeming with people. Olivia's heart lurched when she spotted several vehicles bearing the Winslow family crest. She grabbed a passing journalist by the arm. "Why are the Winslows here?"

The reporter shrugged. "No clue - I'm just covering the event."

Olivia's face drained of color. Clutching Isabelle tighter, she pushed through the crowd. Inside, she saw the Winslow family pointing accusing fingers at Liam. "Don't believe a word he says! That's Liam Blackwood - the man who murdered his own mother! How can you trust a killer?" The declaration sent shockwaves through the assembled crowd.

The reporters descended on Liam like vultures circling fresh carrion. They surged forward in a frenzied mass, cameras flashing wildly, each desperate for the perfect shot. Several bold journalists attempted to rip off Liam's mask, hungry for a glimpse of the infamous face beneath.

But Liam was no easy target. Protected by an impenetrable wall of heavily armed bodyguards, he remained untouchable. Removing his mask would require getting past defenses no reporter could breach.

Olivia's pulse raced as she spotted Victor. Without hesitation, she marched toward him, her steps quick and purposeful. "Victor!" Her voice cut through the chaos like ice, belying the fear tightening her chest. "This man is my fiancé, not-"

Victor slowly lifted his head, his lips curling into a mocking smile. "Olivia, darling. Getting nervous now that Liam's little secret might be revealed?"

Olivia drew a steadying breath. "Liam left me for Evelyn. Why would I take him back after what he did? He nearly got both me and Isabelle killed with Evelyn's schemes. I despise-"

Victor's gaze lingered, his expression taunting yet meaningful. "Then why the urgency? If he's not Liam, why not just prove it? One quick tug of that mask would settle everything."

Olivia's hands balled into fists as she fought to keep her voice level.

"And who exactly do you think you are, demanding he reveal himself? Push this any further, and you'll have both the Sinclair family and the stock exchange breathing down your neck. Can the Winslow family really afford that kind of attention?"

"My fiancé values his privacy. Forcing him to unmask under public pressure would be a grave miscalculation. Call off your men now, and I might consider forgiveness. If you still doubt me, I'll arrange a private viewing."

Olivia was playing for time, desperately hoping to preserve Liam's secret a little longer.

Though the Winslows might be powerless against Liam directly, Olivia understood he must have compelling reasons for maintaining his anonymity despite being back for months. She owed him too much not to help safeguard his secret.

"An interesting proposition," Victor's tone was deceptively agreeable, but his men remained in position, and his smile held a wolfish edge. He reached out to pat Olivia's shoulder, but she recoiled, her face twisting in disgust as she took several steps back. Victor's eyes darkened momentarily before he erupted into chilling laughter.

The sound was so hollow and cruel it sent shivers down Olivia's spine. Instinctively, she pulled Isabelle closer, shielding the child's eyes from the unfolding drama.
###Chapter 439

Victor's manic laughter finally died down. His bloodshot eyes burned with wild intensity as he tightened his grip on Olivia's wrist, his teeth grinding together.

"Olivia, you're so clever I almost believed you." His voice dripped with venom. "But I'm not that stupid. Want to see what I discovered?"

With a triumphant smirk, Victor pulled out his phone and shoved a photo in Olivia's face.

The woman in the picture was breathtaking - her radiant smile contrasting with an aura of delicate vulnerability. Her striking features blended cultural influences perfectly, creating an undeniable beauty that commanded attention. The faint crease between her eyebrows only enhanced her fragile, ethereal quality.

Olivia studied the image, a strange sense of recognition tugging at her memory. Victor's smug voice cut through her thoughts. "You've probably guessed by now. This is Eleanor Blackwood, the internationally acclaimed war journalist they call the 'Dove of Peace.' She's Mr. Liam's sister from the CK market in Valtierra."

He leaned closer, his breath hot against Olivia's ear. "Mr. Liam is a decade older than his sister, which would make him nearly forty now. But your so-called fiancé doesn't look anywhere near that age, does he?"

Olivia's mind raced as she fought to maintain her composure. "You can't judge someone's age just by appearances."

Victor's mocking laugh sent chills down her spine. "Fair point, sweetheart. But I thought of something better." His grin turned predatory. "I invited her here today. You claimed you saved Mr. Liam's life abroad and got engaged. Let's see if Eleanor recognizes your precious fiancé."

A cold wave of panic crashed over Olivia. Her palms grew slick with sweat, her limbs turning leaden. Victor's smirk widened at her obvious distress. "I've had my suspicions about his identity for weeks. I even saw photos of Liam's corpse from the accident. But I covered all my bases - made sure Eleanor would be here."

To Olivia, Victor's smile belonged to the devil himself. He hadn't changed - still terrifying in his cunning. Though lacking brute strength, his strategic mind made him deadly.

He was the predator who stalked from shadows, waiting with infinite patience for the perfect strike. Even in failure, he'd linger unseen, never releasing his prey from his sights. Being hunted by Victor was a fate worse than hell itself.

Olivia wiped her damp palms discreetly on her dress, resisting the urge to flee. "Fine. Bring Eleanor here. I'm not afraid."

She shot Liam a meaningful glance, praying he'd catch her silent warning to prepare Eleanor before it was too late.

Thirty tense minutes later, excited murmurs rippled through the crowd as footsteps echoed in the grand hall.

"Oh my God! Is that really Eleanor Blackwood?"
"I can't believe she's here!"
"She's even more stunning in person!"

Eleanor's humanitarian work in war zones had earned her global admiration and a massive following. More than just a celebrity, she'd become an icon whose influence dwarfed anyone in entertainment.

The journalist moved with confident grace, her long, softly curled hair cascading down her back. Despite her simple attire of a sleeveless top and trousers, her natural beauty shone through, enhanced by her no-nonsense demeanor.

Though her sunglasses obscured half her face, her delicate jawline and perfectly shaped lips left a lasting impression.

Olivia's pulse pounded in her ears. She considered approaching Eleanor to warn her, but hesitated. Any suspicious behavior might backfire and make things worse for Liam.

As she desperately searched for a solution, movement caught her eye. Standing beside Eleanor was a familiar figure - Oliver Hart, who'd been at Liam's side earlier.

###Chapter 440

Olivia's head was still throbbing from the drug's aftereffects when she realized Oliver had disappeared. Though curious about his sudden absence, she didn't bother asking - he hadn't exactly been kind to her during their forced interaction.

Spotting Oliver standing protectively beside Eleanor, Olivia exhaled in quiet relief. Their body language suggested a long-standing familiarity.

Victor practically tripped over himself in his eagerness to reach Eleanor. "You must be the illustrious Eleanor Blackwood," he fawned, thrusting out his hand. "Even more radiant in person than on those magazine covers. I'm Victor Blackwood, head of the Blackwood family. We've corresponded online."

Eleanor paused, her piercing gaze sweeping over Victor with detached amusement. A polite but frosty smile touched her lips as she deliberately ignored his outstretched hand. "Mr. Blackwood," she acknowledged coolly.

Without another word, Eleanor brushed past the stunned man, leaving him standing there with his hand hanging awkwardly in the air, his face flushing with humiliation.

Victor's smile flickered momentarily before he recovered, his voice booming across the room. "Miss Blackwood, you should know there's an impostor here claiming to be your brother and his companion. Not only are they deceiving everyone, but they're also attempting to evade murder charges! I'd hate for your family's reputation to suffer when this scandal breaks."

Eleanor moved to stand beside Liam, giving him an unreadable look that sent murmurs rippling through the crowd.

Gasps and whispers erupted like wildfire.

"Could he really be a fraud?"

"I heard that's actually Liam - the one who murdered his own mother years ago!"

"Someone like that belongs behind bars. Why haven't the authorities arrested him yet?"

"Perfect match for Olivia - two cold-blooded killers."

Victor basked in the accusations, his chin lifted triumphantly as he glared at Liam.

"Liam," he sneered, "if you get on your knees and beg for mercy now, I might consider letting this go. I kept quiet before hoping you'd reform, not parade around impersonating someone and scamming people."

Liam met Victor's gaze with icy defiance. "First, I'm not the Liam you're accusing. Second, you think you have the right to demand I kneel? You overestimate your authority."

Victor gaped, momentarily speechless.

Eleanor took a deep breath before casually linking arms with Liam, her voice laced with concern. "Why didn't you tell me you were back and in trouble? If Oliver hadn't mentioned it, I'd still be in the dark." Her gaze swept the room disdainfully. "How dare these people question your identity. Someone's clearly trying to turn me against you. I wonder what their true motives are."

Her loaded statement hung heavily in the air.

Victor's smirk vanished. "He can't possibly be your brother! Look at him!" Even with the mask covering half his face, Liam appeared to be in his late twenties - nowhere near the forty-something he should be.

Eleanor's cold gaze silenced the murmurs. "I owe none of you an explanation," she stated calmly. "This is my brother, Mr. Jack. Shall we conduct a DNA test right here to settle this?"
###Chapter 441

The room plunged into silence. No one dared to challenge her presence.

Eleanor Blackwood commanded respect with just her presence. Crossing her meant inviting instant social ruin, becoming the target of vicious gossip.

Liam Blackwood glanced up at Eleanor, his brow furrowing slightly. "You didn't have to return for this," he murmured.

Eleanor's lips curved into a playful pout, softening her usually stern expression. "I missed you terribly," she confessed with a mischievous glint in her eyes. "Don't you miss me at all?"

Liam remembered his role as her brother. Maintaining his cover was crucial. "Naturally," he forced himself to reply.

A radiant smile illuminated Eleanor's face.

To any observer, it appeared to be nothing more than a tender sibling moment.

Victor Blackwood paled dramatically. So this wasn't Liam? Damn! He'd just insulted someone extremely powerful.

Evelyn Hartley panicked even more. She sprang to her feet, nearly tripping in her haste. If this man was truly Eleanor's brother, Mr. Jack, then Olivia would gain even more leverage against her. Blast it! Why did Olivia always—

An idea struck Eleanor, and she turned her icy gaze toward Olivia.

Olivia wasn't certain if she imagined it, but Eleanor's eyes seemed to hold a dangerous glint when looking at her.

Suddenly, Eleanor pointed an accusing finger at Olivia. "He's my brother, but I've never seen this woman before. She certainly wasn't the one who rescued him abroad. She's clearly using him for her own purposes."

Gasps filled the room at Eleanor's shocking accusation. Evelyn exhaled in relief, settling back into her chair with a triumphant smirk as she watched Olivia's face drain of color.

Liam grabbed Eleanor's arm and pulled her aside, his voice a low, dangerous growl. "What the hell are you playing at?"

Eleanor blinked innocently before whispering, "You're impersonating my brother, so I must tell the truth. If I hadn't returned, this woman would have exposed you. Oliver's right—she's trouble. I'm helping you. Can't you see that?"

Her expression shifted to one of genuine concern mixed with frustration. "You've maintained this identity flawlessly for years. I won't let you throw it all away for some woman!"

With a regal wave of her hand, Eleanor commanded the gathering, "Detain that woman immediately! She's an imposter claiming to have saved my brother!"

Evelyn eagerly added fuel to the fire. "Miss Blackwood, she's also a murder suspect! She deceived your brother, hoping he'd help her escape justice. Don't let her get away!"

Eleanor's piercing gaze locked onto Olivia, burning with intensity. "You're absolutely correct. She won't escape."

Liam released Eleanor's arm, his voice cutting through the room like ice. "I dare anyone to lay a finger on her! Whether she saved me or not is irrelevant now. What matters is that I love her."
###Chapter 442

Eleanor Blackwood's face drained of color, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. The words she longed to scream—that Liam wasn't Mr. Jack—lodged in her throat like a stone. The fury that had burned inside her moments ago dissolved into something far heavier.

Defeated, Eleanor turned on her heel and walked away without another word.

Liam closed the distance between himself and Olivia, his fingers intertwining with hers. Olivia stood frozen, still reeling from his declaration. His words had struck her like lightning, igniting something deep within her chest.

This man was willing to throw away everything—his reputation, his safety—for her. But the thought twisted her stomach. She didn’t want to owe him. Not again.

The warmth of his hand grounded her, but the conflict inside her raged on. She lowered her voice to a whisper. "Eleanor is the only one who can protect your identity as Mr. Jack. This is reckless, Liam. Have you completely lost your mind?"

His dark eyes burned with resolve. "I told you, I love you. I failed you before. I won’t make that mistake again." His grip tightened slightly. "Olivia, you and Isabelle don’t have to be afraid anymore. I’ll take care of you both."

Her breath hitched. Tears welled in her eyes, blurring her vision.

Isabelle tugged at her sleeve, glancing around at the lingering crowd. "Mommy, can we go home now?"

Before Olivia could answer, Liam swept the little girl into his arms. "Yes, let’s go home."

With that, he led them away, leaving the stunned onlookers behind. The evidence Liam had presented was irrefutable, dismantling every accusation against Olivia in one swift motion. Victoria Ellington stood frozen, her face ashen. She hadn’t expected Eleanor—Mr. Jack’s own sister—to side with Liam at the most critical moment.

Now, Victoria had nothing left. A cold dread slithered down her spine as her legs gave out, sending her crumpling to the floor. Just then, her phone buzzed—Daniel’s name flashing across the screen.

She snatched it up, her voice raw with hysteria. "Are you happy now? Now that I’m going to rot in prison? You must be laughing, aren’t you? With me gone, nothing stands between you and Olivia anymore!"

Silence stretched on the other end before Daniel finally spoke, his voice eerily calm. "You know I never loved you. I married you out of obligation. I tried to be a decent husband. You saw that—you just refused to accept it. Instead, you blamed Olivia for everything. Even if she had never come back, you would have found someone else to hate." His tone hardened. "I thought I could keep pretending. But I was wrong."

Tears spilled down Victoria’s cheeks. "You never loved me—not even a little! Then why did you marry me?" Her voice cracked. "You’re the reason I became like this!"

"Yes," Daniel admitted, bitterness lacing his words. "It’s my fault. And I’ve made my decision. I’ll spend the rest of my life atoning for my mistakes. I won’t return to the Bennett family. I won’t seek love. I’ll tend to your mother’s grave until the day I die."

Victoria’s breath caught. A broken laugh escaped her, tangled with sobs. Regret and self-loathing crashed over her in waves. She wanted to beg him to stay—to tell him she could change.

But before she could utter another word, the call ended. Daniel had severed the last thread between them.

Then—

The door burst open with a violent crash.

Police officers swarmed the room.

Victoria had known this was coming. She’d returned to the country knowing Liam’s men would hunt her down if she stayed abroad. But now, faced with the inevitable, she realized—no one could predict what awaited her next.

###Chapter 443

Olivia Sinclair never expected the authorities to track her down this fast.

The detective in charge cut straight to the chase. "We received an anonymous tip about your location. You're under arrest for the murder of your mother. Do you wish to make a statement?"

The moment she heard about the tip, Olivia knew exactly who'd betrayed her. Daniel Bennett. She swore she'd never forgive him, not in this lifetime or the next.

Meanwhile, Liam Blackwood brought Olivia and Isabelle back to his penthouse. To his dismay, Eleanor Blackwood and Oliver Hart had followed them uninvited. The sight of them made Liam's temples throb.

Olivia noticed the venom in Eleanor's glare. She discreetly slipped her hand from Liam's grasp and cleared her throat uncomfortably. Liam had been watching Olivia until that moment. His expression turned glacial as he faced Eleanor.

"Should I book your return flight," he demanded, voice dripping with irritation, "or would you prefer I throw you out personally?"

Eleanor's voice trembled with hurt. "I came back for you, Liam. Turned down three job offers in Paris. You've never treated me like this before." Her gaze flicked to Olivia. "Something's changed, and I know exactly why."

Liam's jaw tightened at the implication. "Nothing's changed. The problem is your behavior today. Unless you want me to physically remove you?"

"What if I refuse to leave?" Eleanor challenged, lifting her chin defiantly.

The atmosphere turned electric with tension.

Oliver intervened hastily. "Sir, Miss Blackwood returned because she's in trouble abroad. She has nowhere else to go. You gave your word to protect her - are you breaking that promise now?"

Eleanor shot Oliver a glare. "I didn't want him to know that!" She scoffed bitterly. "Before her, he would've helped without question. Now I'm just an inconvenience. Fine. I'm leaving." She turned to Liam with wounded eyes. "You're breaking your vow to my brother for some gold-digging nobody."

As Eleanor stormed toward the door, Olivia felt a migraine coming on. This was exactly why she avoided drama. Eleanor shared an unshakable bond with Liam, and now Olivia was caught in the crossfire of false accusations.

"Miss Blackwood," Olivia called out, then gave Liam a meaningful look. "Mr. Blackwood and I have no romantic involvement. Our public appearances were strictly business. You're welcome to stay." Taking Isabelle's hand, she added, "Just don't involve me in your personal affairs again."

Before leaving, Olivia told Liam firmly, "Stay away from me. I want no part of this mess."

Liam looked stunned, a flicker of pain crossing his features. Eleanor watched with narrowed eyes. "So there's really nothing between you two?"

Ignoring her, Liam turned on his heel and walked away, shoulders tense.

Tears welled in Eleanor's eyes as she whispered to Oliver, "See? I've already lost."

###Chapter 444

Oliver didn't know how to react when he saw Eleanor's eyes welling up with tears. "Please, don't cry," he murmured softly. "Just stay by his side. Love will come in time. You're an extraordinary woman, Eleanor. Half the men in Newport would give anything for your attention. I'm absolutely certain Liam will fall for you."

Eleanor's lips curved into a satisfied smile. "My brother made the right choice taking you under his wing. He funded your education and secured your position at Blackwood Enterprises. Though you couldn't repay him before his passing, helping me now honors his memory just the same."

Oliver dipped his head in agreement. "You have my word."

When Olivia returned home, she immediately began packing suitcases.

Isabelle watched with curious eyes. "Where are we going, Mommy?"

Olivia smiled as she folded a sweater. "How about a special adventure, just you and me? Would you like that, darling?"

Isabelle nodded eagerly, her little hands clutching her stuffed bunny. "Can Liam come too?"

The smile froze on Olivia's face, though her voice remained gentle. "Not this time, sweetheart. This is our mother-daughter trip. We'll have so much fun together, and we'll be back before you know it." She crouched to meet Isabelle's eyes. "Liam has someone special in his life now. Let's not bother them, okay?"

Isabelle's lower lip trembled slightly. "But Liam told me he doesn't have a girlfriend."

Olivia smoothed her daughter's hair with infinite patience. "Whether he does or doesn't, that's not our concern anymore. You wouldn't want to make him uncomfortable, would you?"

The little girl twisted the hem of her dress. "I don't want anyone to be sad."

Olivia gave Isabelle's cheek an affectionate pinch. "Do you remember what we just talked about?"

Isabelle nodded solemnly. "Yes, Mommy. I remember."

At that moment, Winston entered with a worried expression.

"Miss Sinclair, is this sudden departure truly necessary? Perhaps you should rest first before traveling? We still don't know the full effects of that medication in your system. Leaving now could be dangerous."

He continued earnestly, "After your recent illness, you should either see a doctor or return to the Kensington estate. At least there you'd have proper medical support if anything happens."

Olivia shook her head firmly. "Winston, I feel perfectly fine now. More importantly, I need to settle this matter quickly. I refuse to owe anyone anything—it only leads to complications later." Though she didn't elaborate, Winston suspected this involved Liam's recent stay.

Seeing her resolve, Winston stopped protesting. Instead, he made a firm request. "Then at least allow me to accompany you."

Olivia hesitated, but Winston persisted.

"Miss Sinclair, I know you worry about my age, but please—let me come. I can tell you've discovered something about your grandfather's disappearance. You wouldn't be rushing off otherwise." His voice grew more insistent. "I won't rest unless I'm by your side. Perhaps we'll find some trace of him during our travels."

Moved by his devotion, Olivia finally relented. "Alright, pack your things. We leave tonight."

"Very good, Miss."

###Chapter 445

Liam finally shook off Eleanor's persistent presence and hurried to Olivia's villa, only to find it empty. His heart sank as he interrogated the staff, but none could tell him where she'd disappeared to.

The servants' blank expressions made his jaw tighten. He knew better than to waste time pressing them further. After a moment's hesitation, he turned on his heel to confront Eleanor directly.

Eleanor had been sulking in her room, wounded by Liam's cold dismissal earlier. When he unexpectedly appeared at her door, hope flickered across her delicate features. "Liam," she breathed, her voice trembling between joy and pain. "I thought you'd never want to see me again."

Liam didn't mince words. "Are you satisfied now that you've driven her away?"

"Who?" Eleanor's feigned confusion lasted only a second before realization dawned. Her hands balled into fists at her sides.

"Open your eyes!" she snapped. "She doesn't care about you. Why chase someone who sneaked away without a word? She's clearly running from you. Have some self-respect!"

Liam's eyes narrowed dangerously. "So you had her followed."

Caught in her own trap, Eleanor lifted her chin defiantly. "Yes, I had people watching her. But I didn't interfere - I just wanted to understand what makes her so special to you."

Liam turned to leave, done with the conversation. "Tell me where she is, or I'll have you removed from this estate immediately."

Eleanor crossed her arms. "If you're so determined, find her yourself. It shouldn't be difficult for someone like you."

"You know damn well it would be," Liam countered coldly. "Not when you've gone to such lengths to cover her tracks."

He knew Eleanor's methods too well. She could make Olivia vanish without a trace for months. Tears welled in Eleanor's eyes at his threat, her lower lip trembling with wounded pride.

"Liam," she whispered hoarsely. "Do you even hear yourself? You're invoking my brother's memory. Have you forgotten the debt you owe him? How can you treat me this way?"

"I owe your brother nothing," Liam stated flatly. "What I did for him was a courtesy, not an obligation."

Eleanor refused to believe he felt nothing for her. "Then why? Pity? Some lingering affection you can't admit to?"

A humorless smile touched Liam's lips. "Don't test me, Eleanor. My patience has limits."

When their eyes met, the complete absence of warmth in his gaze made her chest constrict. After a tense silence, she finally relented. "I'll tell you where she is. But I have one condition."

"Name it," Liam said tersely. "But if it's unreasonable, the answer is no."

Eleanor's nails dug into her palms. "I know how badly you want to find her. My request is simple - take me with you. I'm in danger. Those men hunting me might track me here. I need protection."

Liam's expression darkened. Every instinct told him to refuse, but his history with her brother complicated matters. His lips pressed into a thin line before issuing a final warning.

"One wrong move," he said icily, "and I'll hold you personally responsible for any harm that comes to her."
###Chapter 446

Tears rolled down Olivia's cheeks as Liam walked away, her mind drifting back to their first encounter. Liam had always maintained an icy distance between them. Yet young Olivia had clung to hope, convincing herself his aloof nature would eventually thaw for her.

The painful truth struck her upon returning to the country. She witnessed Liam's unexpected tenderness toward Seraphina. His coldness wasn't inherent - it was reserved specifically for her.

Around Seraphina, Liam transformed. His eyes softened with affection, his voice carried warmth Olivia had never experienced. The realization crushed her, yet she refused to accept defeat. Surely after years by his side, some affection must have grown, even if Liam remained unaware.

When Liam assumed leadership of Sinclair Enterprises, challenges arose daily. While he handled most alone, Olivia proudly assisted with several critical matters. Colleagues often remarked how perfectly they worked together, whispers of their compatibility reaching her ears. Gradually, she believed it herself - she was Liam's ideal match.

Liam's unwavering devotion to Seraphina infuriated Olivia. She hired investigators to monitor Seraphina's activities. The reports baffled her - what could Liam possibly see in such an ordinary woman?

Olivia considered herself superior in every way. Seraphina merely ran a business, standing out only through striking looks - and Olivia matched her there. Further digging revealed Seraphina's Kensington lineage, fueling Olivia's contempt. She prided herself on self-made success, unlike the privileged heiress.

No matter how she analyzed it, Liam's obsession with Seraphina made no sense. But Olivia wouldn't surrender. They weren't married yet - she still had time. Even if they wed, marriages dissolved daily. Olivia trusted in her own allure.

Meanwhile in Westhaven, Olivia didn't immediately visit Sinclair Enterprises as promised. Instead, she and Isabelle explored the city, savoring temporary freedom. An early arrival might alert Liam, disrupting her hard-won peace.

Her priority remained finding Alistair, last spotted in Westhaven according to sources. Her team monitored all exits; with no sightings of his departure, he likely remained in the city.

The latest report brought relief - Alistair appeared well cared for when last seen. Strangely, no hospitals or police held records of him. For now, he seemed unharmed.

Fingers tracing the jade token Alistair had gifted her years ago, Olivia felt its familiar warmth. Suddenly, unease prickled her skin - what hardships had he endured alone since disappearing? She'd confided these fears to Donovan.

Donovan had remained silent for a long moment before responding. "This burden isn't yours to carry. The responsibility lies with me - I insisted he accompany you."
###Chapter 447

The salty ocean breeze carried the sound of children's laughter as Olivia Sinclair watched her daughter play by the shore. She tightened her grip on her phone, still processing Donovan Kensington's reassuring words. "You've done everything possible. Grandfather Alistair will be safe - no one would dare harm a Kensington. Let's keep this between us for now. I'll make all necessary arrangements."

Olivia understood the unspoken weight behind Donovan's calm tone. The entire Kensington family continued their daily routines, blissfully unaware of Alistair's disappearance. She could only imagine the immense pressure Donovan must be shouldering alone.

Meanwhile, little Isabelle remained happily oblivious to the adult concerns. She knelt in the wet sand, her small hands carefully shaping towers and turrets alongside other children. The afternoon sun glinted off her golden curls as she worked with intense concentration.

"Mommy! Look!" Isabelle came running, her bare feet kicking up sand as she tugged Olivia's hand excitedly. "I made our house! The other kids think it's magical!"

Olivia's breath caught when she saw the sandcastle. While not perfectly identical, the structure bore striking resemblance to their villa in Crestwood. The arched doorways, the distinctive balcony - Isabelle had recreated them all with remarkable accuracy.

"You're incredible," Olivia murmured, smoothing Isabelle's wind-tousled hair while masking her surprise. "How did you remember our home so well?"

"It just came to me!" Isabelle beamed, her cheeks flushed with pride. "Like a picture in my head!"

Olivia felt her heart swell. She'd never imagined her daughter might inherit her architectural eye.

"Do you enjoy building things like this?" Olivia asked gently.

Isabelle scrunched her nose in thought before shaking her head. "Then what do you like doing?" Olivia pressed.

Another head shake. "I don't know yet."

"That's perfectly fine," Olivia assured her, kissing Isabelle's forehead. "You'll discover what you love in time. There's no rush." She wanted nothing more than for her daughter to explore the world without pressure.

Their peaceful moment shattered when a loud crash echoed across the beach. Olivia turned to see Isabelle's carefully constructed sandcastle demolished under the foot of a stocky boy. He stood over the ruins with a smug expression. "That was ugly anyway," he declared loudly.

Olivia took Isabelle's trembling hand and approached the boy with measured steps. "Did you destroy my daughter's castle?" Her voice remained calm but carried an edge. "Why would you ruin someone's hard work?"

The boy crossed his arms defiantly. "Because I wanted to. So what?"

Olivia's smile turned icy. Years of martial arts training abroad had given her more than just business skills. In one fluid motion, she seized the boy's collar, her grip deceptively strong for her slender frame.

"Let go! You can't do this!" the boy squirmed, his bravado crumbling as he realized he couldn't break free.

No bystanders intervened - they'd all witnessed his destructive act. "I'll release you when you learn some manners," Olivia stated coolly.

The boy's face turned red, tears welling in his eyes as he stopped struggling. Olivia set him down but kept a firm hand on his shoulder. "Now apologize."

"Why should I?" he muttered, though his defiance wavered.

Olivia's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Would you prefer another lesson in respect?"

The boy gulped visibly. The beach suddenly felt several degrees colder despite the afternoon sun.
###Chapter 448

Oliver recoiled, his entire posture changing in an instant. "I'm sorry," he mumbled, his voice barely audible.

Isabelle's mother, Olivia Sinclair, fixed him with a stern gaze. "Explain yourself. This behavior is unacceptable."

The boy hung his head, his earlier bravado gone. Then, without warning, his lips twisted into a smirk as he shoved Isabelle with surprising force for a child his size. The impact sent her sprawling onto the coarse sand.

Isabelle's piercing wail cut through the beach air. Olivia's heart clenched as she rushed to scoop up her daughter, her hands immediately checking for injuries. Angry red marks were already forming on Isabelle's delicate skin.

On concrete, this could have been catastrophic. A dangerous mix of fury and protectiveness surged through Olivia's veins.

Her sharp eyes found the culprit hiding behind a woman who appeared too young to be his mother. The woman had striking features - large, doe-like eyes that might have been beautiful if not for their current hostile glare directed at Olivia.

Taking a steadying breath, Olivia approached with Isabelle still crying in her arms. "Excuse me," she said, keeping her tone measured. "Your boy just destroyed my daughter's sandcastle and pushed her down. He needs to apologize, and he needs proper discipline. This kind of behavior can't be excused by age."

The woman's brow furrowed. "I'm his adoptive mother. Oliver's never been a problem before. There must be a reason for this."

Olivia's lips thinned. So this was that type of parent - making excuses for unacceptable behavior. Her voice turned glacial.

"Multiple witnesses saw what happened. Look at these bruises. If this had happened on pavement, we'd be in the emergency room right now. Either you handle this properly, or I will."

Olivia's security team, sensing the escalating tension, moved closer, forming a discreet but unmistakable perimeter around the confrontation.

The woman paled visibly. "Are you threatening us?" Her voice rose shrilly.

Olivia's smile held no warmth. "Consider it motivation for good parenting. I tried reasoning first."

Fear flashed across both the woman and boy's faces. Oliver began sobbing uncontrollably while his adoptive mother's jaw worked silently, though defiance still burned in her eyes.

"He was homeless before I took him in," she spat. "We've only just started building a life together, and now we have to bow to your spoiled princess? Rich people always get their way, don't they?"

With that, she roughly pushed Oliver forward. "Apologize to her."

The boy shook his head violently, tears streaming down his face. "No! She said she'd have me thrown to the sharks! That's why I pushed her!"

In perfect synchronization, both the woman and child turned accusing gazes toward Olivia and Isabelle.

###Chapter 449

"Mommy, I never said that! Never!" Isabelle protested, her voice trembling with indignation. Olivia Sinclair tightened her embrace around the little girl, whispering soothing words. "I was right beside you the whole time, sweetheart. You didn't say anything wrong. He's lying through his teeth."

It shocked Olivia how effortlessly such a young child could fabricate stories. Just then, murmurs spread through the gathering crowd. "Wait, isn't that Margaret Sinclair? The famous philanthropist?" someone gasped. "There must be some mistake here."

"It is her! She wouldn't harm a fly - she's taken in dozens of orphaned children!"

"You should just walk away. Don't make a scene."

Olivia's eyebrows shot up in surprise. She hadn't expected this well-dressed woman to be a public figure. Margaret appeared young and affluent, but the Sinclair name didn't ring any bells among the elite families. Several onlookers had already started recording the confrontation on their phones.

Isabelle buried her face in Olivia's neck, tiny hands clutching her mother's blouse. "Mommy, please take me home," she whimpered, her voice muffled against Olivia's shoulder. "I'm scared."

Olivia stroked her daughter's golden curls reassuringly. "Don't worry, my love. Mommy will handle everything."

The crowd's recognition seemed to inflate Margaret's ego. She tilted her chin up imperiously, looking down her nose at Olivia. "You wealthy socialites think you can push everyone around," Margaret sneered. "Apologize to Oliver right now, and we'll consider this matter closed."

Olivia's temper flared hotter. Gently setting Isabelle down, she pointed to the destroyed sandcastle. "My daughter was playing peacefully over there moments ago. There was no conflict between her and Oliver until he deliberately stomped on her creation. Multiple witnesses saw everything. I never laid a finger on him. So tell me, how should we resolve this?"

Her voice remained steady, each word dripping with controlled fury. Margaret's cheeks flushed scarlet. She glanced sharply at Oliver, silently demanding an explanation.

The boy rolled his eyes dramatically before launching into his fabricated story. "The contest rules say everyone builds their own castle! But her mommy helped her! That's cheating!" he declared with practiced conviction. "I had to destroy it - those are the rules!"

"I made this all by myself," Isabelle piped up, her small voice surprisingly firm. "Mommy's castles are much prettier than mine."

Margaret strutted over to examine the demolished structure. Turning back to Oliver, her face broke into an approving smile. She ruffled his hair affectionately. "Good boy, standing up against cheaters. Imagine learning to cheat at such a tender age! What kind of adult would she become?"

Olivia's hands balled into fists at her sides. "Miss Sinclair, where's your proof my daughter cheated? This beach was packed with people! Everyone saw Isabelle building that castle alone!"

Margaret planted her hands on her hips, her voice dripping with theatrical outrage. "Are you calling me dishonest? Accusing me of slander? Everyone in Newport knows my reputation for integrity! Look at this sandcastle - it's practically professional work! There's no way a toddler could create this alone!"

The crowd murmured in agreement, their earlier certainty wavering. Some remembered seeing Isabelle working diligently, but now doubts crept in. Perhaps the mother had secretly helped when no one was watching. A few children tried to speak up for Isabelle, but their parents quickly silenced them. Nobody wanted to cross the influential Margaret Sinclair.
###Chapter 450

No one dared to contradict Margaret Sinclair, which only fueled her arrogance. She shot Olivia Sinclair a mocking glance. "Well? Any more pathetic excuses? Sure, Oliver might have been a bit harsh destroying your daughter's sandcastle, but it was to teach her a valuable lesson about honesty. You should be grateful, not threatening to throw a child into the ocean! What kind of monster are you?"

"Oliver, darling," Margaret turned to the boy with sickening sweetness, "what punishment do you think these awful people deserve?"

The boy puffed out his chest, mirroring Margaret's haughty demeanor perfectly. "They should get on their knees and beg for my forgiveness. I'm being generous by giving them this chance."

Despite his young age, the cruelty in Oliver's eyes was unmistakable.

Olivia had initially given Margaret the benefit of doubt, knowing her public reputation as a philanthropist who'd adopted numerous children. Perhaps this was just a mother's instinct to protect. But that illusion shattered quickly. No child raised by this woman could possibly develop any decency.

A chilling realization struck Olivia - Margaret and Oliver were two sides of the same coin, equally rotten at their core.

Her icy gaze remained fixed on the pair as the crowd murmured around them.

Margaret's face flushed with anger. "Don't test my patience! I've been more than reasonable. You should be setting a better example for your daughter instead of acting like some deranged animal!"

The onlookers began voicing their disapproval. "How unreasonable can you be?"

"Who would have thought such an elegant-looking woman could be so cruel?"

"Thank heavens Margaret is here to protect poor Oliver from this madwoman!"

Olivia absorbed the baseless accusations in silence. When the murmurs died down, she addressed Margaret and Oliver with a razor-sharp smile. "Trying to bully my daughter, were you? How fortunate that I recorded her building that sandcastle from start to finish. Would you like to see the proof that she created it entirely by herself? My daughter's talents clearly exceed your limited imagination - though I suppose envy is the curse of the mediocre."

Her words landed like a slap. The beach fell deathly silent.

Margaret paled. "That's impossible! She's just a child!"

Olivia's laugh was cold and mocking. "Just because you can't imagine it doesn't make it untrue. My daughter accomplishes things that would never occur to someone like you. Thankfully, her talents don't include bullying or lying like your little protege here."

Her barbed words finally broke Oliver's bravado - the boy looked ready to cry. Margaret, torn between humiliation and rage, weakly protested, "He's just a child! Must you be so cruel?"

Olivia crossed her arms, her voice glacial. "I wasn't looking for a confrontation. I would have handled this quietly if you hadn't tried to blame my daughter for your boy's misbehavior. But when it comes to my child, I draw the line. The truth is undeniable now - will you still refuse to apologize? All that talk about being a decent person - was that just for the cameras?"

She let the words hang before delivering the final blow. "If you were half the person the media claims, you wouldn't defend wrongdoing or make excuses for bad behavior. The way you're acting now makes me seriously question how you're raising all those adopted children of yours."

Just as Olivia predicted, Margaret's face turned scarlet with humiliation. Cornered and unable to defend herself, she could only glare at Oliver in frustration.

###Chapter 451

"Apologize immediately if you've done something wrong," Margaret Sinclair commanded sharply, her voice cutting through the tense air. Oliver Thompson flinched, tears pooling in his wide eyes as he faced Olivia Sinclair.

"You always told me we were the most unfortunate children in the world," Oliver choked out between sobs. "That the universe owed us. You said everything I did was justified. So why am I being punished now? I didn't think teasing her was wrong. You never corrected me before!"

"Silence!" Margaret's complexion turned ghostly pale. The unexpected revelation from the child left her momentarily speechless.

Margaret had always believed these street children were naturally rebellious and impossible to discipline. It had been easier to let them run wild than to actually parent them - a convenient excuse to maintain her charitable facade.

Olivia observed Margaret's guilty expression and added pointedly, "If you're truly incapable of raising them properly, perhaps they'd be better off in state care. You're doing them no favors by permitting this behavior."

"How dare you judge me?" Margaret snapped, her temper flaring. "I give them everything! Some children simply won't listen. I never taught him to lie or bully others. Heaven knows where he learned such things."

Turning back to Oliver with a threatening glare, Margaret hissed, "If you don't apologize this instant, I'll send you back to the gutters where I found you!"

Trembling violently, Oliver shuffled forward. "On your knees! Now!" Margaret barked, her patience completely spent.

The boy dropped to his knees, offering a pitiful, whispered apology. He looked every bit the tragic orphan - a child who'd never been taught right from wrong. Olivia remained unmoved by his display. She'd done nothing to deserve his cruelty.

As they prepared to leave, little Isabelle tugged at Olivia's sleeve. "Mummy, why didn't we just leave earlier? They were both so mean. But... Oliver looked really sad at the end," she said with innocent curiosity.

Olivia smiled wistfully, remembering how her own gentle nature had once made her a target for bullies - kindness that was never reciprocated. Kneeling to meet Isabelle's gaze, Olivia spoke softly but firmly.

"Darling, it's vital to stand up for yourself. When someone hurts you, they must make amends. Never feel sympathy for those who cause you pain."

Isabelle frowned, struggling to comprehend the lesson. Olivia gently pinched her daughter's cheek, silently promising there was no rush to understand. Suddenly, Olivia's hand brushed against her empty pocket where she'd secured the jade earlier. Her blood ran cold - it was gone.

Without hesitation, Olivia sprinted back toward the beach, scanning the sand desperately. The crowds had dispersed. Margaret and Oliver had vanished. Despite an exhaustive search, the precious heirloom remained missing. Olivia knew with certainty it hadn't simply fallen out - it had been stolen during the confrontation.

Her expression hardened into steel. "Monitor all major antique markets in Newport," she instructed her team sharply. "The moment that jade surfaces, intercept the seller."

The unspoken threat of police involvement hung heavy in her words. This wasn't just any trinket - it was a priceless family artifact passed down through generations. And Olivia Sinclair would move heaven and earth to get it back.
###Chapter 452

The car's interior was dim, the leather seats creaking as Oliver Thompson clutched the stolen jade pendant. Silent tears carved paths through the dirt on his cheeks.

Margaret Sinclair's knuckles whitened around the steering wheel. Out of the corner of her eye, she caught the glint of green stone. With a swift motion, she snatched it from Oliver's grasp. The jade felt unnaturally cold against her palm. "Where the hell did you get this?" she demanded.

Oliver's lips curled into a vindictive smile. "Took it from that bitch back there." His street-honed fingers had moved with practiced ease, though he'd never expected to use those skills today. "She had it coming," he added, cracking his knuckles. "Making me apologize like some beggar."

Margaret studied the boy's face, her expression unreadable. Instead of scolding him, she merely warned, "We're staying far away from her from now on. Women like that have power we can't touch."

Oliver wiped his face with his sleeve, but his greedy gaze remained fixed on the pendant. "Margaret, that's gotta be worth something, right? Saw similar pieces at the antique market going for twenty grand easy!"

Margaret turned the jade over, examining its flawless surface. "With this quality? At least triple that."

Oliver practically vibrated with excitement. "Give it back! I know a guy at the market who'll give us cash no questions asked!" He reached for it desperately.

Margaret jerked the pendant away, her voice turning glacial. "This stays with me. You're too young to be dealing with this kind of money. And if I hear you breathed a word about this to anyone..." She let the threat hang in the air.

Oliver's fists clenched so tight his nails drew blood. He'd risked everything for that damn pendant. Who was she to decide? But he swallowed his rage - the orphanage was worse than this. One day, he vowed silently, they'd all pay for treating him like dirt.

As Margaret turned her attention back to the road, Oliver's smoldering glare burned into her profile.

The moment they arrived, a swarm of children descended upon Margaret, tugging at her sleeves and begging for treats.

"Get off me!" she snapped, shoving them away. "Can't you see I'm busy?"

The children scattered like frightened mice.

Margaret stormed into her office and froze. An elderly man sat in her chair, eyes closed, exuding an aura of quiet power. If Olivia Sinclair had been present, she would have recognized him immediately - Alistair Kensington.

Margaret crossed her arms, her lips twisting into a mocking smile. "Remember who you are yet? Or is your memory as useless as the rest of you? If not for those expensive clothes, I wouldn't have bothered picking you up."

She circled him like a vulture, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "You've been living off my generosity - eating my food, wearing clothes I paid for. Nothing in this world comes free, old man."

Alistair remained motionless, his face an impassive mask.

Margaret was accustomed to his silence, but something dark flickered in her eyes. She'd found him weeks ago during an auction in Crestwood, collapsed by the roadside.

His tailored suit had told her everything she needed to know - this was no ordinary vagrant. She'd brought him home, not to help him, but because she recognized opportunity.

She'd never bothered searching for his family. Instead, she'd hoped with time he might grow attached, perhaps even name her his heir.

But Alistair had remained as unreadable as stone, giving nothing away.
###Chapter 453

Margaret Sinclair had finally accepted that the old man had no intention of forming any bond with her. Her plan had failed spectacularly. Now, she contemplated finding his family - or better yet, dumping him right back where she'd found him on the streets.

As far as she was concerned, she'd already gone above and beyond for this senile old fool. She'd housed him, fed him gourmet meals, and even tolerated his nonsensical ramblings for weeks.

Sitting heavily on the velvet couch, Margaret pulled out the jade pendant, turning it between her fingers with greedy fascination. "What secrets do you hold?" she murmured. "I wonder what price you'd fetch at auction..."

With startling agility, Alistair Kensington snatched the pendant from her grasp. His clouded eyes cleared momentarily as he clutched the jade to his chest. "Seraphina," he whispered hoarsely. "My precious granddaughter..."

Margaret's temper ignited like dry tinder. She shoved the old man violently, her voice sharp as broken glass. "How dare you! That belongs to me!"

Alistair staggered but maintained his iron grip on the pendant, his arthritic fingers refusing to relinquish their treasure.

A calculating gleam entered Margaret's eyes as she observed his reaction. She forced sweetness into her tone. "You recognize this heirloom, don't you?"

The old man nodded slowly, his voice thick with emotion. "I gave this to my granddaughter... my shining star..."

Margaret studied the vacant expression creeping back into Alistair's eyes. The gears of her mind turned rapidly. With practiced ease, she conjured tears and adopted a wounded expression. "Grandfather," she whispered brokenly, "don't you recognize your own granddaughter?"

Alistair blinked at her with heartbreaking confusion. "Seraphina? Is it really you?"

Margaret reached for the pendant still clutched in his hands. "Of course it's me. Why else would I have your family heirloom?" Her voice dripped with manufactured hurt. "You've been gone so long... I've searched every corner of Newport for you."

Doubt flickered across the old man's weathered face. Something about this reunion felt... wrong. The memories slipped through his fingers like morning mist.

Seeing his hesitation, Margaret bit her lip hard enough to draw real tears. "After everything I've done to care for you," she sobbed, "you still don't remember me? I just want to go home, Grandfather. Take me home to the Kensington estate."

The sight of her tears broke through Alistair's confusion. His shoulders slumped in surrender. "Very well," he sighed. "We'll return to the Kensington family. But first... I must visit an old friend."

Though his memories remained fragmented, the jade had triggered something deep within him. He vaguely recalled presenting this very pendant to his granddaughter, explaining it would serve as recognition among certain circles.

Try as he might, Alistair couldn't conjure his granddaughter's face - only the crushing guilt of having failed her.

Margaret quickly dabbed at her eyes and pulled out her smartphone, fingers flying across the screen as she searched "Kensington family." Her breath hitched as the search results loaded - sprawling estates, private jets, and billions in assets.

Then the realization struck like lightning - the real Seraphina Kensington was none other than Olivia Sinclair, the woman who'd publicly humiliated her at the Montecarlo charity gala last summer.

###Chapter 454
Olivia Sinclair's expression turned to stone. The mask of the benevolent philanthropist had shattered completely. Her sole objective now was to ensure Alistair Kensington would never reconnect with his true family.

Let them remain estranged for eternity, as far as she was concerned. Blood relations meant nothing. The only thing that mattered was Alistair believing her fabricated tale. If she could manipulate him into formally acknowledging her, she'd seamlessly assume the position of Kensington family heiress without any objections.

Humming a cheerful melody, Olivia departed the premises in remarkably good spirits.

Meanwhile, after several relaxing days spent with Isabelle, Olivia concluded it was time to investigate Liam Blackwood's company operations. Though she'd cherished this downtime, Olivia hadn't been idle - she'd thoroughly researched Halstead's local market during her break.

The historic coastal city was renowned for its antique trade and thriving pearl industry, which had spawned numerous prestigious jewelry businesses.

Liam's enterprise had once been among the industry leaders, highly respected and phenomenally successful several years prior.

Recently however, it had been plagued by consecutive scandals culminating in a disastrous error that nearly destroyed the company entirely.

Recalling her bold declaration to Liam earlier, Olivia now experienced a pang of regret. Liam had undoubtedly alerted the director about her impending visit, and upon entering the corporate office, the director immediately began guiding her through operations.

Every remaining employee appeared intensely focused on their work. Despite the company's spacious layout, the building felt conspicuously underpopulated.

Before Olivia could comment, the director cleared his throat uncomfortably. "We've experienced some... workforce reductions recently," he admitted hesitantly.

Her eyebrows knitted together in concern. "Exactly how many resignations this month?"

The director shrugged helplessly. "At least thirty."

Olivia's eyes widened at the staggering number. At this rate, bankruptcy loomed within two months. With such rapid employee attrition, recruiting new talent would prove increasingly difficult.

"Are there additional contributing factors?" Olivia pressed.

She noted Liam hadn't mentioned this crisis before her arrival - he'd had no reason to conceal it. The director lowered his head, his voice thick with remorse.

"Miss Sinclair, I never intended to withhold this information, but circumstances left me no alternative. The company hemorrhages funds monthly. Continued losses would terminate all our positions."

"I've reluctantly encouraged some resignations because we simply cannot meet payroll obligations. Had Mr. Blackwood discovered this situation, he would have shuttered operations immediately. I've been fighting to keep us solvent."

Olivia's suspicions had been nearly accurate. Hearing the director's confession, conflicting emotions tangled within her. "I understand. Keep me informed of any new developments."

The director ventured cautiously, "Miss Sinclair, even if you terminate my position, I must ask - can you salvage this company? I've devoted ten years here since graduation. The benefits were exceptional, the work fulfilling. I genuinely love this place. It's survived so many challenges..."

...

...
###Chapter 455

Olivia Sinclair whispered to herself, lost in contemplation. "That's precisely why I can't simply walk away from this."

She hesitated before finally committing. "I'll do everything within my power."

From the reports she'd studied, Newport was spiraling downward due to a scandal, though the specifics remained unclear. Today, the director finally revealed the full story.

"It all began with plagiarism," he admitted, his voice laced with frustration and shame. "We hired this brilliant young designer whose creations were breathtakingly elegant and commanded premium prices. She quickly rose to become our lead designer."

"But then the truth emerged," he continued, shaking his head. "She'd stolen designs from an undergraduate student who hadn't even graduated yet."

The director's shoulders slumped as he went on. "The student came forward with undeniable proof. At first, we thought we could contain it. We compensated the student generously and terminated the designer, though she stubbornly maintained her innocence and refused to apologize."

His expression darkened. "Then came the accusations that we'd orchestrated the plagiarism intentionally. Rumors started circulating about previous copyright violations and employee mistreatment. Miss Sinclair, as you know, in today's world, misinformation spreads faster than wildfire. Once public opinion turns against you, it can destroy individuals and corporations alike."

Olivia nodded grimly. People often believed what they wanted to believe. The truth became irrelevant once the narrative took hold. Once tarnished, every word you spoke would be met with skepticism. Even your defenders would face backlash. In this digital age, character assassination had become frighteningly easy and consequence-free.

"What's the current status?" Olivia asked, steadying her breathing to calm her racing thoughts. "It's been two, maybe three years since that incident. Surely it should have faded by now."

The director's bitter chuckle held no humor. "That's what one would expect. But the accuser won't let it go. I don't know what grudge she holds against us or why she continues this vendetta."

Olivia frowned. Why would someone remain fixated on revenge after all this time?

After a moment's consideration, she proposed, "Perhaps you could arrange a meeting? Tell her I'd like to speak with her personally."

The director hesitated. "I'm not sure that's wise. She's unlikely to agree."

"Whether she agrees is her decision. Your role is simply to deliver my message. Are there other complications?"

The director's expression turned grave. "Yes, there's been legal action. When we previously attempted contact, she accused our vice president of harassment and claimed we tried to intimidate her."

Olivia's sharp look prompted the director to quickly add, "None of it was true, of course. It appears she's deliberately provoking confrontation. Given her hostility, we discontinued all communication."

Olivia's lips curled in disdain. "She's clever, manipulating public perception to her advantage. She wants to ensure Newport never recovers because she knows if we regain our footing, she'll be the first one we hold accountable. Set up that meeting. I want to hear her grievances directly from her own lips."
###Chapter 456

Olivia Sinclair stood firm in her decision, and after much persuasion, the director finally relented to arrange the meeting. The dinner was scheduled for Saturday evening at eight.

She brought little Isabelle along as her companion.

When the appointed hour came, Olivia deliberately kept the other party waiting fifteen extra minutes before making her entrance. Just as her fingers touched the gilded doorknob, angry voices spilled through the door.

"Do you take me for a fool? Threatening me won't work! Consider our conversation over. I'm leaving!" A chair scraped violently against the marble floor.

The door swung open just as Margaret Sinclair stormed out, nearly colliding with Olivia in the doorway.

Both women froze in momentary shock.

Margaret recovered first, her lips curling in disdain. "What an unfortunate coincidence."

"Ms. Sinclair," Olivia greeted with practiced politeness, though her smile didn't reach her eyes. "How curious. First you harass my daughter at the beach, now you're targeting my company."

Ice formed in Margaret's gaze. "Targeting? Your company's actions are despicable! Your employees plagiarized my work and tried to buy my silence with money. Did you really think I'd just drop the lawsuit?"

Olivia shook her head. "I'm not here to bribe you. Whether you withdraw the lawsuit or not is entirely your decision."

Margaret faltered momentarily before turning her glare toward the director of Sinclair Enterprises. Her laugh was sharp as broken glass. "So this is your new CEO? Not very impressive. Actually, she seems even more foolish than the last one. You've made a powerful enemy today - I won't forget this."

The director shifted uncomfortably and whispered to Olivia, "Miss, you should know Ms. Sinclair isn't someone to trifle with. She's a respected philanthropist in Newport with considerable influence. Perhaps a more diplomatic approach..."

Olivia studied Margaret's venomous expression and scoffed. "If we yield now, she'll only demand more. Do you honestly think an apology would satisfy her? From the moment I heard about this situation, I knew there was more beneath the surface."

With a resigned sigh, the director stepped back. The board had made their position clear - if Olivia failed to resolve this crisis, Sinclair Enterprises would face dissolution.

Taking Isabelle's small hand in hers, Olivia swept into the private dining room and took her seat with regal poise.

Margaret, incensed at being ignored, snapped, "What's the meaning of this? Did you summon me here just to insult me? Don't expect me to stay quiet about this!"

In a dramatic flourish, Margaret pulled out her phone and launched a live broadcast. Thanks to her carefully cultivated image as Newport's golden-hearted socialite and her prestigious academic background, thousands of viewers flooded her channel within seconds.

Her entire demeanor transformed instantly. Tears welled in her eyes as she addressed her audience in a trembling voice. "My dear friends, today that same unethical company contacted me again."

"I assumed they wanted to negotiate a settlement for their plagiarism case. Of course I refused - such corporations have no place in our community. But no, they invited me here for a far more sinister purpose. They wanted to publicly humiliate me!"

The camera panned to show Olivia calmly sipping her wine, Isabelle quietly coloring beside her, creating a striking contrast to Margaret's theatrical performance.

Viewers' comments began flooding in, the digital audience quickly taking sides in this unfolding drama. Olivia watched the numbers climb with detached interest, knowing the real battle was just beginning.
###Chapter 457

Her acting instincts kicked in instantly. Margaret Sinclair choked back sobs, her voice trembling with emotion. "I just don't understand. All I wanted was justice for the wrongs they've committed. Why do they get to keep operating like nothing happened?"

She wiped her eyes dramatically before continuing. "Plagiarism, worker exploitation, using their power to intimidate—if I stay silent, who will speak up? I'm doing what others are too afraid to do. What did I do to deserve this?"

The live chat exploded—some rallying behind Margaret, others slamming Sinclair Enterprises. Margaret glanced at Olivia, searching for a reaction, but Olivia remained unreadable, her expression cold and composed. A flicker of irritation crossed Margaret's face.

Turning her phone screen toward Olivia and Isabelle, Margaret forced another sob. Olivia immediately stepped in front of Isabelle, shielding her from view.

Through her tears, Margaret's voice cracked with indignation. "The new president of that company? She's a woman, a mother. I thought she'd have compassion. But no—she chose to humiliate me instead. How can one woman treat another like this?"

Olivia's eyes flashed with fury. "Who's the one behaving disgracefully here? Pointing a camera at someone without consent? Who's really using their power to bully others?"

Margaret stiffened but quickly recovered. "If you hadn't pushed me too far, I wouldn't have reacted this way."

Calmly facing the camera, Olivia countered, "Let's set the record straight. Today, I met Miss Sinclair hoping for a civil discussion about why she refused to drop her baseless claims. From the start, she rejected any fair resolution and insisted we abandon our legal rights. All I did was clarify that no bribes or hacking were involved."

She paused, then added pointedly, "Then she accused me of insulting her. But did I? Did I actually insult her?"

Margaret's face tightened. "That's not what happened! You told me to wait, then demanded that if I stayed in Halstead, I had to kneel and apologize to you!"

Olivia nodded slowly, a knowing smile playing on her lips. "Is that so? What a shame this room is under surveillance. Keep lying. I'll just have security pull the footage to clear my name."

Margaret froze. Realizing her mistake, she hastily ended the live stream, her face paling.

Olivia smirked, stepping closer and patting Margaret's shoulder. "I was bluffing. No cameras here, Miss Sinclair. But your reaction says everything, doesn't it?"

Margaret's expression twisted in anger. "Are you trying to provoke me?"

Olivia's tone was icy. "Don't flatter yourself. The company is already in ruins. You know I don't need the money. If it can't be saved, I'll shut it down myself. I don’t want a company like this anyway."

Margaret clenched her fists, defiance burning in her eyes.

Olivia continued, "The reason I met you today was to inform you—I'm filing a lawsuit. You've been spreading lies and damaging my company's reputation through public manipulation."

Margaret's eyes widened. "You're suing me?"

Olivia smiled faintly. "Yes. But don’t worry—I won’t bother you before the court date. We’ll settle this legally."

With that, Olivia took Isabelle's hand and walked away. Watching Olivia leave, Margaret felt a surge of panic—and rage. "You bitch!" she spat, her voice trembling with fury.

The confrontation was far from over.
###Chapter 458

Margaret Sinclair's hands trembled with barely contained fury. The porcelain bowl flew from her grasp, shattering against the marble floor in a thousand glittering pieces. Like a hurricane unleashed, she swept her arm across the table, sending cutlery and glassware crashing to the ground.

When the storm within her finally subsided, the damage was considerable. The commotion brought a young waitress rushing to the private dining room. Her professional smile faltered at the scene of destruction. "Madam, if there's anything we can do to assist you, please let us know. This kind of behavior really isn't necessary."

Margaret's lips curled into a sneer as she crossed her arms. "Must you be so dramatic? I'm a paying customer. What's a few broken dishes between friends?"

The waitress inhaled sharply through her nose, maintaining her composure. "Madam, I'm afraid we'll need to settle your bill immediately."

"What?" Margaret's perfectly sculpted eyebrows shot up. "You expect me to pay? That entire table was supposed to be covered by the foundation!"

"The other guests informed us it was separate checks. Between your meal and the damages, your total comes to three thousand dollars."

Margaret felt her blood pressure spike. "This is outrageous! I'll have you know—"

"Madam," the waitress interrupted coolly, "if you're experiencing temporary financial difficulties, we can arrange a payment plan. But the balance must be cleared within seventy-two hours."

Something inside Margaret snapped. Before she could stop herself, her palm connected sharply with the waitress's cheek. "How dare you imply I can't pay? Do I look like some common beggar to you?"

The waitress stumbled back, clutching her reddening cheek but maintaining her silence. With a final glare, Margaret threw down her platinum card. As she stormed out, she caught sight of the humiliated waitress kneeling to clean the mess.

The restaurant manager appeared moments later, placing a comforting hand on the young woman's shoulder. "Dry those tears, dear. We can't have customers seeing you like this."

"It's not fair," the waitress whispered, her voice thick with injustice. "I was just doing my job. Being wealthy doesn't give her the right to—"

"Enough!" The manager's voice turned sharp. "Do you have any idea who that was? Margaret Sinclair - philanthropist of the year, darling of Newport society. The governor himself presented her with the Humanitarian Award last month."

He lowered his voice conspiratorially. "She's taken in dozens of orphans and elderly. We overlook certain... eccentricities. Cross her, and you'll never work in this city again."

The waitress bit her lip hard enough to draw blood, her eyes burning with silent rebellion.

Outside, Margaret found herself walking straight into a downpour. She made no move to call a car or summon an umbrella, letting the rain soak through her designer dress. Part of her hoped she might collapse dramatically on the sidewalk - maybe even go viral, with all the blame falling on that insufferable Olivia Sinclair.

But her robust constitution betrayed her. Despite the cold rain pelting her skin, she felt annoyingly alert. The frustration built until she stamped her Louboutin-clad foot in a puddle.

Then she saw it.

A sleek Maybach idling at the traffic light down the block.

A slow, calculating smile spread across Margaret's face as an idea took shape. The perfect revenge was within reach. All she needed was the right moment.

###Chapter 459

The air inside the luxury car was perfectly climate-controlled, yet Liam Blackwood couldn't shake the icy sensation creeping down his spine. Beside him, Sebastian Montgomery watched as his boss massaged his temples with long fingers, the impatience evident in every sharp movement.

"Mr. Blackwood," Sebastian ventured cautiously, his voice betraying his nervousness. "You needn't concern yourself with Miss Eleanor. Our security team has the situation well in hand."

Liam's eyes snapped open, his lips curling into a humorless smile. "Do you actually believe that nonsense you're spouting?"

Sebastian swallowed hard. He'd witnessed Eleanor Blackwood's capabilities firsthand. Not even the legendary Mr. Jack could control that woman when she set her mind to something.

Outside the car, Margaret Sinclair sat drenched on the pavement. Despite her disheveled appearance, she managed to lift her gaze to study Liam through the rain-streaked window. The calculating glint in her eyes suggested her injuries weren't as severe as they appeared.

Was this some sort of scam? Liam's sharp gaze took in her designer clothes and expensive jewelry - she clearly wasn't desperate for money. Sebastian leaned closer. "Shall I arrange transport to Mercy Hospital, sir?"

Liam responded with nothing but a cold stare that sent Sebastian scrambling from the vehicle, umbrella in hand.

Margaret blinked rainwater from her lashes as footsteps approached. First came the sight of handmade Italian leather shoes worth more than most people's monthly rent. Her gaze traveled upward, taking in the imposing figure of the masked man before her. The disguise did nothing to diminish his striking presence - if anything, it added an air of dangerous mystery. Her pulse quickened. She'd been right about him.

Liam studied the woman before him, noting how despite her trembling hands, her eyes remained sharp and assessing. "Speak quickly," he commanded, his voice like frozen steel. "What game are you playing? My patience wears thin."

Margaret rose unsteadily to her feet, swaying slightly for effect. "Forgive me, sir. I felt faint and collapsed. Your kindness is appreciated."

A derisive snort escaped Liam as he turned away. Margaret couldn't let this opportunity slip through her fingers. She rushed forward, tears welling in her eyes. "Wait! There's more. I'm being hunted by a powerful enemy. I thought... perhaps someone of your obvious stature could help. I can make it worth your while."

Sebastian barely suppressed a laugh at the transparent ploy. Liam's expression darkened further. "Do I look like the sort of fool who falls for such obvious theatrics?"

Margaret's voice dropped to a whisper. "My enemy controls half of Westhaven's underworld. Check my credentials - I run the largest information network in Newport. My children see everything. Need someone found? A problem disappeared? I'm your woman."

Liam turned slowly, one eyebrow arched. "Is that so?"

She nodded eagerly. "Just one night of protection. That's all I ask. You're clearly capable - why would I lie to someone like you?"

Sebastian interjected quietly, "Sir, we know nothing about this woman. It could be a trap."

Liam's gloved hand rose, silencing his assistant. His piercing gaze never left Margaret's face. "You have exactly thirty seconds to convince me not to leave you here in the rain."

Margaret's mind raced. This was her chance. She straightened her shoulders, all pretense of weakness gone. "Because I know who's been sabotaging your Royal Arch project. And I can deliver them to you on a silver platter."
###Chapter 460

Liam's lips curved into a smile that never touched his piercing blue eyes. "Perhaps she's telling the truth. Though you know what awaits her if she's lying."

Sebastian remained silent, casting a pitying glance toward Margaret.

"Miss, please step inside the vehicle," Sebastian murmured, holding the car door open with practiced elegance.

Margaret's spirits lifted momentarily as she slid into the plush leather seats, but her smile faltered when she noticed Liam still standing outside. The rain pattered against his black umbrella as he maintained his distance, showing no intention of joining her.

"Hey—" Her voice trailed off uncertainly.

Sebastian offered a diplomatic explanation. "I hope you'll understand."

With a discreet gesture toward Liam, he continued, "He maintains strict boundaries with unfamiliar women."

Margaret nodded slowly, though her eyes betrayed a storm of emotions she couldn't quite conceal. She hadn't anticipated such ironclad self-control from the notorious Blackwood heir.

If destiny wove their paths together, she mused, at least she wouldn't have to worry about other women catching his wandering eye. Her gaze lingered on Liam's profile as she silently vowed to breach those formidable defenses.

Meanwhile, Olivia had just returned home and was preparing legal documents against Margaret when her phone vibrated unexpectedly. The screen displayed an unknown number, yet she knew with absolute certainty who was calling.

She exhaled sharply before answering. "What do you want?" Her voice could have frozen hell itself.

The line remained silent for several heartbeats before Liam finally spoke. "Olivia, I'm here. I know you don't want to see me, but I can't stop worrying about you and Isabelle. I'll keep my distance—just close enough to watch over you both."

Olivia drew a shaky breath. "Liam, you need to understand—you're only making things harder for me by doing this."

Silence stretched between them again.

Olivia's mind drifted back to the early days of their marriage, when she'd been so insecure, so desperate for his attention. She remembered spending entire days waiting at Blackwood Enterprises, too afraid to ask where he was, too proud to let anyone see how much it hurt.

She'd feared making him look bad—the powerful CEO with his clingy, naive wife. Yet someone had noticed anyway.

The next day, security had stopped her at the building's entrance. Liam had said those same cutting words to her then.

"Olivia, you're only making things harder for me by doing this." She remembered how the sunlight had warmed her skin while ice spread through her veins. How she'd forced a smile to hide the tears threatening to fall. Never had she imagined she'd one day throw those same words back at him.

Liam must have remembered too. His voice softened. "I'm sorry, Olivia. I never meant those words. I was terrified someone in the company might hurt you. I was drowning in work, terrified I couldn't protect you properly."

The line crackled with unspoken regrets.

Olivia's fingers tightened around her phone as old wounds throbbed anew. The past hung between them like a ghost neither could exorcise.
###Chapter 461

"Let's just leave the past behind," Olivia interrupted sharply. The rain outside her window fell in relentless sheets, mirroring the storm in her heart. "I saw how determined Eleanor was that day. She's clearly chosen you. Whatever we had is over, and I won't stand in your way."

Liam's grip tightened around his phone until his knuckles turned white. "Do you truly believe Eleanor and I belong together?" His voice cracked with unspoken emotion.

Olivia remained silent, watching the raindrops race down her windowpane. The world outside blurred into watery abstraction, much like her tangled feelings for Liam. She was done drowning in this emotional quagmire.

After a steadying breath, Olivia continued, "Liam, despite your tarnished reputation, you're still extraordinary. And Eleanor? She's remarkable in her own right. She knows your history better than I ever did."

Her fingers traced invisible patterns on the cold glass. "You understand each other perfectly. With her influence, you could rebuild everything. You're ideal for each other. Don't let pride make you lose her - you'll regret it forever."

The line went dead with a sharp click before Liam could respond. Olivia stared at the darkened screen until her reflection blurred with unshed tears. The phone slipped from her fingers just as little Isabelle came bounding in, rubbing sleep from her eyes.

"Mommy! I dreamed about Daddy!" Isabelle's sleepy voice pierced through Olivia's melancholy.

Olivia's heart clenched as she gathered her daughter into her arms. Isabelle's wild bedhead and rosy cheeks made her look like a cherub straight from a Renaissance painting. "What did you dream about, sweetheart?"

Isabelle scrunched her face in concentration. "I... I can't remember his face. But he said he misses us so much!" Her small hands clutched Olivia's sweater. "When is Daddy coming home?"

Olivia's throat tightened. She brushed Isabelle's hair back, buying time to compose her answer. "Soon, darling. He's very busy with work right now. But he can feel how much you miss him, even from far away."

Isabelle's entire face lit up like sunrise over Newport harbor. "Really? That's amazing! Daddy knows I love him!" She clapped her hands with childish delight.

Olivia forced a smile, but guilt twisted in her chest like a knife. Years ago, she'd crafted this elaborate fiction to protect Isabelle's fragile heart. Now the lie had grown roots too deep to uproot without causing devastation.

As Isabelle snuggled closer, warm and trusting, Olivia prayed time would soften the eventual revelation. Maybe by then, Isabelle would have outgrown her childish fantasies about an absent father.

"Mommy, tell me more stories about you and Daddy!" Isabelle demanded, planting a sticky kiss on Olivia's cheek.

"Of course, my love," Olivia murmured, hoisting Isabelle higher in her arms as she carried her toward the nursery. Each step felt heavier than the last, weighed down by the unspoken truth.
###Chapter 462

The afternoon sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows as Liam Blackwood instructed Sebastian Montgomery to escort Margaret Sinclair to one of his private villas. His voice was low, commanding secrecy.

Margaret’s breath caught as she stepped inside the opulent three-story villa. Though her family was far from poor, this level of luxury was beyond anything she’d ever experienced. Over the years, she had meticulously built her fortune—charity work, We-Media endorsements, shrewd investments.

But the truth behind her philanthropy was far less noble.

The children and elderly she "saved" were quietly transferred to a welfare home. She had struck a deal with the staff—funding in exchange for silence. She didn’t care how they were treated.

Her livestreams brought in staggering revenue, and the company still owed her a hefty compensation. Yet, even with her wealth, owning a villa like this in downtown Newport was impossible.

In the car, she had pretended to sleep, eavesdropping as Sebastian spoke to Liam. Their conversation was laced with mentions of asset management, high-society galas, and exclusive banquets. Liam wasn’t just wealthy—he moved in circles she desperately wanted to enter.

Liam gestured toward the first-floor guest rooms. "Pick one. But you leave before I come down tomorrow." His tone left no room for argument.

Margaret’s lips twitched in disappointment, but she nodded. "Of course."

The moment Liam disappeared upstairs, she abandoned all pretense of rest. The villa, though not sprawling, was staffed with discreet servants. After a calculated pause, she approached one.

"Excuse me, where’s the kitchen?"

Minutes later, she set up her livestream, the marble countertops gleaming under the soft lighting. "Hello, darlings," she cooed, her voice trembling just enough to sound vulnerable. "I couldn’t eat earlier—I was too upset. But now, I’m cooking… not just for myself, but for the man who saved me today."

Comments flooded in, a mix of sympathy and curiosity.

"Jenny, where are you? That kitchen looks insane!"

She had been waiting for this. A delicate blush colored her cheeks. "This is his home. If he hadn’t stepped in… I don’t even want to think about what might’ve happened."

"Did those corporate bullies hurt you again?"

"You missed a meal? That’s awful!"

"Why can’t people just be kind? After everything you do!"

Some fans had already forgotten the restaurant incident. Others remained skeptical.

But Margaret didn’t care.

She had exactly what she wanted—attention, sympathy, and most importantly, a foot in Liam Blackwood’s world.
###Chapter 463

"Wasn't it all just a huge misunderstanding back then? Didn't Margaret manipulate her followers to cyberbully the company?"

"Absolutely. If she's truly innocent, why hasn't she released the security footage? They offered to let her review it, but she abruptly ended her livestream - seems suspicious to me."

"Margaret's fans behave like they've been brainwashed."

These critical comments were quickly drowned out by Margaret's devoted supporters. The chat rapidly shifted focus as curiosity grew about the mysterious man in the video. Eager to steer the conversation, one fan typed, "Margaret darling, please tell us what really happened this afternoon."

Margaret feigned hesitation. "I really shouldn't discuss this... but since you're all so insistent." She sighed dramatically. "Promise to keep this between us? I wouldn't want to cause any trouble for my knight in shining armor."

The live chat exploded with heart emojis and pleading messages.

With practiced ease, Margaret began weaving her fabricated tale. While the truth was she'd never intended to call a cab, she painted Olivia as the villain who'd forbidden her from hailing one.

She didn't stop there. Using carefully chosen suggestive language, Margaret described her encounter with Liam, sprinkling romantic implications where none existed. She conveniently omitted how Liam's car had only stopped because she'd dramatically collapsed in front of it.

Her version? Liam had seen her drenched and vulnerable in the rain, been moved by compassion, and ordered his driver to pull over. Upon hearing her plight, the mysterious billionaire had not only given her a ride but offered his protection for the night.

As Margaret concluded her fictional romance, a delicate blush colored her cheeks. Just as she'd anticipated, her fans ate it up. "This is totally love at first sight! I'm shipping them so hard!"

"That Maybach means serious money. Rich, mysterious, and chivalrous? He's literally book boyfriend material! No way he'd just randomly rescue someone unless he felt something special."

Reading these comments, Margaret allowed herself a small, satisfied smile. Everything was going exactly according to plan.

"Someone please tell me I'm not the only one dying to see his face! Margaret, can't you ask him to remove that mask?"

"The mystery is killing me! Why won't he show his face?"

"If anyone could get him to take it off, it would be you, Margaret! You clearly mean something to him."

Margaret's blush deepened as she played coy. "Oh stop! I think we should take things slow. Maybe start as friends first..."

The next morning, Olivia prepared to pick up Isabelle herself. As she moved about the kitchen, her daughter came running in clutching a tablet. "Mommy! Look! Liam's on the news!"

Olivia's eyebrows shot up. Liam? On television? That didn't make sense. Given Liam's intensely private nature and current circumstances, why would he ever agree to a media appearance? Something wasn't right here.

###Chapter 464

Olivia snatched the iPad from Isabelle's hands without a word, her eyes scanning the screen intently. A wave of relief washed over her when she realized it wasn't a formal TV interview, but rather a covert live stream captured from a hidden camera angle.

Someone had positioned themselves at the study entrance, secretly filming Liam. The live chat was exploding with excitement.

"Good heavens! He's so tall and commanding. That mask is hiding what must be a gorgeous face."

"Those are bespoke Savile Row suits he's wearing. Each button probably costs more than my monthly rent."

"The way he carries himself - pure aristocracy."

The more Olivia read, the more confused she became. It was undoubtedly Liam. But how could anyone possibly be broadcasting live from his private office?

Her brow furrowed as she continued watching. Then a familiar name appeared in the comments.

"Margaret, don't be nervous! Go talk to him. This is your chance to remove that mask. He rescued you from the roadside - he must fancy you."

"I bet he was smitten the moment he laid eyes on Margaret."

Olivia blinked rapidly, wondering if she'd read correctly. Liam had fallen for Margaret at first sight?

Soon, Margaret's trembling voice came through. "Please stop teasing. I'm just going in for a friendly chat. We're merely acquaintances."

Olivia was completely baffled about how Margaret and Liam knew each other. But a quick scroll through the comments provided the missing pieces - apparently Liam had rescued Margaret. Olivia sensed this situation was far more complicated than it appeared.

At that moment, Liam shifted in his chair, lifting his head. Though the mask obscured his features, his piercing gaze was cold enough to freeze blood. Margaret visibly trembled, her hands shaking uncontrollably. The oblivious viewers continued their playful banter.

"Margaret, he's noticed you! Go say hello."

"This is so romantic! He's probably waiting for you to make the first move."

Olivia found the comments laughable. She typed a warning: "He looks furious. If you stay, you're risking his wrath - and trust me, you don't want that."

Immediately, Margaret's devoted followers attacked Olivia with vicious insults.

Faced with the barrage of abuse, Olivia merely scoffed. She had no interest in engaging with such blind devotion and returned her attention to the unfolding drama.

By now, Liam had risen from his desk. He began advancing toward Margaret with slow, deliberate steps.

Margaret hadn't shown fear on the live stream yet, but she responded to Olivia's warning. "To whoever wrote that comment, I don't know what your agenda is. I understand Liam better than anyone, so please stop making these malicious assumptions." Her voice quivered as she spoke.

###Chapter 465

Olivia sensed that Margaret wasn't frightened; the woman was practically vibrating with excitement. Through the screen, Olivia caught the glacial chill in Liam's piercing gaze and merely smirked. What else was there to say? She simply mouthed "good luck" to Margaret.

Liam halted directly before Margaret.

The blonde tilted her head up eagerly, her voice dripping with saccharine sweetness. "Sir... Is there something I can help you with?"

Then came the sharp clatter of a phone hitting marble. A choked gasp followed.

The live stream audience had expected a romantic moment between Margaret and her dashing rescuer. Instead, they watched in stunned silence as Liam's hand closed around Margaret's delicate throat, his voice arctic. "Did you forget our conversation this morning?"

The chat froze for three heartbeats before exploding into chaos. Some viewers tore into Margaret while others panicked, demanding someone call emergency services.

Just as suddenly, Liam released her.

Margaret collapsed onto the cold floor, still reeling. Liam's voice cut through the tension like a blade. "Sebastian, remove her immediately. She's giving me a migraine."

And with that brutal efficiency, Liam's security team ejected Margaret - all captured live for her streaming audience. The viewers who'd been shipping them moments ago now realized their fantasies had spiraled out of control.

An awkward silence blanketed the chat, broken only by gleeful critics seizing their moment. "Pathetic! Did she think this was some cheap romance novel? The man clearly tolerated her out of politeness before she became unbearable."

"Am I the only one who finds Margaret's entire persona manufactured? She's got a different mask for every occasion."

"Absolutely. And her cult-like followers attack anyone who points it out."

Margaret scrambled upright, humiliation burning her cheeks. Liam had shown zero restraint. She comforted herself that he couldn't possibly know about the live stream - he wouldn't have been so cruel otherwise.

She wanted to end the broadcast immediately, but the damage control couldn't wait. After an agonizing pause, she finally spoke.

"I... I realize I've offended him deeply." Her voice trembled with practiced vulnerability. "Please don't follow my example, everyone. I only wanted to befriend him. He's wealthy and kind-hearted - I thought he might sponsor the orphans and elderly I care for. But his reaction..." Fat tears rolled down her cheeks. "This is entirely my fault. I overstepped terribly."

The criticism evaporated instantly. However disingenuous Margaret might be, her charity work was legitimate. She had, after all, done genuine good.

As the comments turned sympathetic, Margaret's shoulders relaxed. She offered a few closing remarks before hastily ending the stream.

Olivia stared at her darkened screen, her mind racing with questions about Liam and Margaret's connection. Before she realized it, her fingers had navigated to Liam's contact.

Her thumb hovered over the call button... then withdrew. This wasn't her business to meddle in. And she certainly had no right to demand explanations.

Meanwhile, Eleanor Blackwood struggled to locate Liam's current residence. She arrived at the imposing gates just in time to witness a disheveled Margaret being escorted out by stone-faced security.

###Chapter 466

Eleanor Blackwood's delicate brows knitted together. "Who on earth was that woman? What was she doing lurking around here?"

She shot Oliver Hart a pointed glance that spoke volumes.

Oliver immediately understood the unspoken command and hurried after Margaret Sinclair.

He returned moments later, his expression dark with irritation. "That woman was absolutely insufferable," he muttered under his breath. "No manners whatsoever. But I did catch something interesting - she was ranting about Olivia Sinclair. Managed to piece together quite the story."

"Really?" Eleanor's eyes lit up with interest as she leaned closer, her whisper barely audible.

Oliver looked genuinely shocked. "But Miss, I saw her leaving Mr. Liam's estate with my own eyes. Doesn't that raise any red flags?"

This was Newport's most exclusive neighborhood - sprawling mansions hidden behind towering privacy hedges. Liam Blackwood's estate stood alone, isolated from prying eyes.

Eleanor watched Margaret's retreating figure with a disdainful curl of her lip. "She's not even in the same league as Olivia. Hardly worth my attention. But her hatred for Olivia is palpable. Even without knowing the details, we can certainly exploit that."

"Understood. I'll begin immediately," Oliver nodded, his mind already racing with possibilities.

Meanwhile, Olivia Sinclair had been consulting with the director about visiting the designer embroiled in the plagiarism controversy.

She'd discovered the designer was Margaret's exact contemporary - same university, same department, even the same graduating class.

Back in her student days, the designer had been considered a prodigy. Despite humble beginnings, her raw talent and relentless drive had caught the attention of Sinclair Enterprises. They'd offered her the chief designer position upon graduation - an unprecedented opportunity.

What should have been a fairytale success story had instead exploded into a career-ending scandal.

When the plagiarism allegations surfaced, the designer had vehemently denied copying anyone's work. But without drafts or supporting evidence, her protests fell on deaf ears. Ultimately, she'd issued a public apology and vanished from the design world entirely.

Rumors suggested her current circumstances were... less than ideal.

Olivia hadn't realized how dire the situation was until she saw the designer's living conditions for herself. The director hadn't exaggerated in the slightest.

After a three-hour drive to Westhaven's outskirts, followed by an hour's trek on foot, Olivia finally reached a dilapidated shack that looked moments from collapse.

She could hardly believe her eyes. Even with the plagiarism scandal, this was a university graduate - a once-promising talent. How had she ended up in such squalor?

The answer came sooner than expected. An elderly woman with snow-white hair shuffled past Olivia. The octogenarian moved with painful slowness, her hunched frame barely able to support itself. She paused at the door, wheezing from the exertion.

Just then, the yard's rusted gate creaked open. A strikingly beautiful but painfully thin young woman emerged, her movements uneven. Strands of loose hair framed a face that was both delicate and hauntingly lovely.
###Chapter 467

Olivia froze in shock. The young woman before her had a visible disability she hadn't anticipated.

Evelyn Whitmore felt the weight of Olivia's gaze and lifted her chin. Confusion flashed across her face before being replaced by a storm of emotions - anger, fear, and something akin to resignation. With quick movements, she ushered the elderly woman inside and slammed the door shut.

Olivia sprang forward, pressing her palm against the weathered wood. "Please," she called out, her voice laced with urgency. "Are you Evelyn Whitmore? I'm Olivia Sinclair, CEO of Sinclair Enterprises. I need to speak with you."

Only silence answered her.

She knocked again, the sound echoing through the quiet street. "I'm not here to cause problems," Olivia assured the closed door. "Just a few questions, that's all."

Finally, a voice responded - cold as winter and guarded like a fortress.

"What now? Has Margaret caused more trouble? Do you expect me to apologize again?" The bitterness in Evelyn's words cut through the door. "I've told everyone a thousand times - I never stole anyone's designs. Yet I was forced to take the blame, to grovel before Margaret just to appease her wounded pride. I returned every penny they gave me. What more could you possibly want? Just leave me alone!"

Olivia's breath caught. This was news to her. No wonder the director had refused to accompany her. If Evelyn spoke the truth, Sinclair Enterprises had committed a grave injustice.

Before coming, Olivia had researched Evelyn's work thoroughly. The designer's talent shone through every piece she'd created, even her early student works.

Though not a jewelry designer herself, Olivia had restored countless antique pieces. She recognized artistic signatures when she saw them. Evelyn's work carried a distinctive thread, a creative DNA that ran through all her creations.

Olivia's instincts screamed that this wasn't plagiarism. There had to be another explanation - something buried, something unseen.

"Miss Whitmore," Olivia softened her tone, pressing closer to the door. "I'm not here to make your life harder. Let me in, and I'll do everything in my power to uncover the truth about what really happened. Things aren't always what they seem. Let me help you."

Still, the door remained shut.

Olivia exhaled sharply, wracking her brain for another approach when inspiration struck. "Your grandmother," she said, urgency coloring her words. "She didn't look well, Evelyn. I can't imagine how difficult these years have been for you both. Let me in, tell me your side, and I'll ensure she gets proper medical care. I'll even draft a contract - no strings attached. Money won't be an issue."

The silence stretched unbearably long. Then, with a reluctant creak, the door inched open.

Tear tracks glistened on Evelyn's cheeks as she glared at Olivia, her voice trembling with barely contained emotion. "If this is some cruel joke, I swear you'll regret it!" The threat sounded hollow even to her own ears. Evelyn had never been one for empty words, but desperation had forced her hand. Her grandmother's declining health and their financial ruin left no other options.

The plagiarism scandal had severed all family ties, turning Evelyn into an outcast among her own relatives. Only her grandmother's unwavering love kept her from complete isolation. The elderly woman had insisted they retreat to this village, promising time would heal all wounds. But years had only deepened the scars.

###Chapter 468

The memories of suffering she and her grandmother had endured flooded Evelyn's mind, filling her heart with sorrow, remorse, and a growing resentment. Why couldn't they just leave her alone?

Olivia sensed Evelyn's profound despair as they entered the small house. Without hesitation, she extended a platinum credit card toward the trembling young woman.

"Take this. Get your grandmother proper medical care immediately. Once we know her diagnosis, I'll arrange for the top specialists at Mercy Hospital. Don't worry - I'll move heaven and earth to help her, as long as there's still hope."

Evelyn stared at the gleaming card in disbelief, her fingers twitching but not taking it. Suspicion darkened her tired eyes as she pushed the card back. "I can't accept this," she whispered hoarsely. "Not after everything. I won't walk into another trap. Please, just go. People like you always want something in return."

Olivia's chest tightened at the sight of Evelyn's gaunt frame, but she didn't insist. Instead, she followed the reluctant girl deeper into the dimly lit house.

Suddenly, a frail figure lunged from the shadows, swinging a worn broom with surprising force.

The bristles struck Olivia's shoulder before she could react, the unexpected attack making her stumble back.

When Olivia looked up, she saw Beatrice Whitmore - Evelyn's grandmother - brandishing the broom like a weapon, her thin arms shaking with effort but her eyes blazing with protective fury.

"Get out!" the old woman rasped. "Haven't you done enough harm? Leave my granddaughter alone!" Evelyn's blood ran cold as Olivia's expression became unreadable. Panicked, she threw herself between them.

"Miss Sinclair, please! She didn't mean it!" Evelyn babbled desperately. "After everything that's happened... after Margaret Sinclair made me apologize publicly... my grandmother just wants to protect me."

Tears streaked Evelyn's hollow cheeks. "We don't want your money. Just leave us in peace."

Olivia's stern features softened as she recognized the raw terror in Evelyn's eyes. She offered a gentle smile, raising her hands in a placating gesture. "I'm not angry, just concerned. This place..." She glanced around at the crumbling walls. "No one should live like this. I meant what I said - I'm here to help, not hurt."

Her gaze shifted to Beatrice, noting the alarming pallor of the elderly woman's skin. "Your grandmother needs a doctor now."

Evelyn opened her mouth to refuse again when a violent coughing fit wracked Beatrice's frail body.

The old woman clutched at her chest, still trying to shield Evelyn even as her strength failed. "Don't... take their charity," Beatrice gasped between coughs. "You're at Westfield University... that's all I ever wanted for you... a chance I never had..."

Hearing her grandmother's words, something in Evelyn hardened. She met Olivia's gaze squarely. "I'll tell you what you want to know," she said, voice steadier now. "But you have to promise - proper medical care, no strings attached."

Beatrice's face flushed with anger and she raised a trembling hand, but Olivia intervened smoothly. "She's doing this for you," Olivia said gently. "Let me help. You can stay right here while we talk - if I say anything out of line, you can throw me out yourself."

The old woman hesitated, then nodded weakly, sinking into a nearby chair as another cough shook her thin frame.

Olivia turned back to Evelyn, her expression both compassionate and determined. "Now, tell me everything."
###Chapter 469

Evelyn Whitmore's shoulders slumped in defeat, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. She muttered curses under her breath, her trembling fists pounding against her thighs in helpless frustration.

Olivia Sinclair didn't press for answers immediately. She allowed the tense silence to settle between them, giving the distraught woman space to collect herself before addressing the delicate matter.

When Evelyn finally composed herself, they retreated to a quiet alcove. The designer clutched her glass of water with shaking hands, the ice cubes clinking as she began her halting confession.

"I didn't steal anyone's work," she whispered, her voice thick with emotion. "But somehow Margaret Sinclair produced identical designs right after my manuscript vanished. I have no idea who took it."

Evelyn's breath hitched as she struggled to contain her rising anger. "I've searched everywhere, but no one believes me. Maybe it's some cosmic joke, or perhaps - as Margaret claims - I subconsciously copied her work after seeing it somewhere. Our collections are similar, yes, but I didn't plagiarize. I won't confess to something I didn't do."

Olivia exhaled slowly, recognizing the impossible position Evelyn found herself in. "So your refusal to admit plagiarism is why they're determined to ruin you."

The story was full of holes, making Evelyn an easy target. Without concrete evidence to prove her innocence, yet unwilling to falsely confess, she remained trapped.

Olivia's instincts prickled with the certainty that deeper truths lay hidden. She leaned forward, piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn. "I can't help you if you're keeping secrets. Are you absolutely certain you're telling me everything?"

Her tone carried quiet intensity, eyes searching Evelyn's face for any flicker of deception.

Evelyn averted her gaze, her whisper barely audible. "I've told you the truth."

Olivia sighed, the weight of their conversation pressing down. She stood, her voice measured yet distant. "If that's your final answer, I'll cover your grandmother's medical bills for now. After that, the choice is yours. You've decided silence is worth the consequences. That's your prerogative."

Evelyn shot to her feet, cheeks flushed with indignation. "What would you know?" she snapped. "You've no idea what my family's endured. How dare you judge me?"

Olivia remained unshaken, her calm voice cutting through the outburst. "I don't know your family's struggles, but I offered you my help - a chance to trust me. If you can't take that leap, I understand. But without trust, there's nothing more I can do. Do you see that?"

Panic flashed across Evelyn's face as she rushed after the retreating figure. "That's it? You're just walking away?"

Olivia paused, turning with razor-sharp focus. "What would be the point? You're determined to keep your secrets. I can't force the truth from you, no matter what I offer or threaten. Money alone won't make you talk."

Her tone softened slightly. "I know this isn't what you want to hear, but understand - I didn't come here to mock you. I came because I remembered the brilliant designer you once were. Seeing you now, with all that fire and creativity gone... the Evelyn I admired seems lost."

Evelyn stood frozen, Olivia's words striking deeper than any accusation. Unexpected tears blurred her vision as she watched Olivia's retreating back, the truth of those words cutting through her defenses.
###Chapter 470

Evelyn Whitmore stood paralyzed for a heartbeat, then steeled herself. This opportunity couldn't slip through her fingers.

With sudden determination, Evelyn rushed after Olivia Sinclair, her uneven steps betraying her limp. But dignity didn't matter now - Olivia was her only hope.

"Miss Sinclair!" Evelyn's voice broke as she called out.

Olivia turned just in time to see Evelyn collapse to her knees. Shocked, Olivia hurried to help her up. "What's this about? Just speak plainly." Tears streaked Evelyn's face as years of carefully constructed walls crumbled.

"You're right about me." Evelyn wiped her cheeks. "I lost my fire long ago. But I refuse to surrender. I didn't plagiarize! How dare they force me to bear the blame? Why must I suffer for crimes I didn't commit?"

As Evelyn's words hung between them, Olivia felt puzzle pieces snapping into place. Now she understood the tragic truth - Evelyn and Margaret Sinclair were half-sisters, bound by blood and betrayal.

Margaret's mother had been the lawful wife, while Evelyn's mother became the unwitting mistress, deceived by Frederick Whitmore's lies. When they met, he'd concealed his marriage. By the time Evelyn's mother discovered the truth, she already carried his child.

Frederick promised divorces and futures, but Evelyn's mother refused to break a family apart. She tried to leave.

But Frederick threatened suicide, public shaming - he'd brand her a homewrecker, destroying her reputation and career. Terrified and trapped, she stayed, clinging to false promises. A year passed. Evelyn was born. The divorce never came.

Finally recognizing the manipulation, Evelyn's mother fled with her daughter.

Years later, cruel fate reunited the half-sisters at Westfield University. Frederick spotted Evelyn on campus, recognizing his abandoned child instantly.

The fragile peace shattered. Evelyn's already frail mother couldn't withstand the resurfaced trauma.

Determined to end the threats, Evelyn's mother confronted the Whitmores directly. She arrived at their mansion ready to expose the truth to everyone - including Margaret's mother.

Then tragedy struck. Overwhelmed by the revelations, Margaret's mother leaped from the balcony. Both daughters witnessed the horrific moment.

No one could have predicted this outcome. From that day, Margaret harbored bottomless hatred for Evelyn. When Evelyn's mother later passed away, the Whitmores rejected Evelyn completely.

Only Beatrice Whitmore stood firm. Defying family wishes, the matriarch declared Evelyn her granddaughter and took her in.

Evelyn expected to be hidden away in some remote cottage - the family's way of ensuring she wouldn't interfere with Margaret's life. But what she found was Beatrice's own humble home, where the elderly woman had lived alone in quiet hardship.
###Chapter 471

The devastating revelation hit Evelyn like a tidal wave. Frederick wasn't Beatrice's biological son at all - just an orphan she'd taken in and raised as her own. Beatrice had poured her entire heart into raising him, never imagining he'd abandon her the moment fortune smiled upon him.

Beatrice had welcomed Evelyn into her home out of pure compassion, shouldering responsibility for the young woman's tragic circumstances. Though bound by no blood relation, they became each other's anchor in this cruel world, clinging to the fragile connection that remained Evelyn's sole comfort.

Tears cascaded down Evelyn's cheeks as she choked out, "I know Margaret stole my designs. She framed me, but what choice do I have? My mother...she's indirectly responsible for her mother's death. Olivia, do you think it was my mother's fault? Should she have stayed silent?"

Olivia's heart ached as she handed Evelyn a tissue. A soft sigh escaped her lips, weighed down by the tragic tapestry of events that had shaped Evelyn's life.

"Let me share my perspective," Olivia said gently. "If your mother hadn't spoken up then, your family would have endured endless harassment. Frederick would have continued manipulating her, using you as leverage."

"Your mother might have been driven to utter despair. Or perhaps Frederick would have simply moved on to another woman. Think about it - how would Frederick's wife have reacted then? Given his reputation as a playboy, he'd certainly had other affairs. How do you suppose his wife coped with that?"

Evelyn carefully reconstructed the memories - Frederick's wife's deteriorating health during that period. She recalled the frantic hospital visit, the doctor's furious words to Frederick and Margaret: "I warned you both about her severe bipolar disorder! How could you let her near the balcony?"

At the time, consumed by guilt, neither Evelyn nor her mother had grasped the full implications.

"The true villain here is Frederick, not you," Olivia continued firmly. "You were deceived. You never intended to disrupt anyone's life. You merely sought the truth in desperation. Margaret has wronged you for years. This must end."

Evelyn looked up, dazed. "So...I don't owe her anything?"

Olivia offered a reassuring smile. "You never did."

Evelyn rose, a moment of clarity washing over her, then hesitated and sank back down. "But what's the point now? The damage is done. There's no undoing it."

Gratitude shone in Evelyn's tear-filled eyes. "Miss Sinclair, thank you for listening. You're the first to take my side. And thank you for covering Grandmother's medical bills. I don't know how to repay you. I was so unreasonable earlier!"

Overcome, Evelyn bowed her head, tears streaming freely.

Olivia quickly reached out, lifting her up, her heart breaking at the sight of Evelyn's distress.

Evelyn was younger than Olivia - a constant reminder of little Isabelle. A nagging worry plagued Olivia: Would Isabelle face similar bullying and false accusations when she grew older? What battles might she have to fight?

After comforting Evelyn, Olivia revealed her plan. "I want you to return to Sinclair Enterprises and resume your work as a designer."

Evelyn recoiled in shock. "Miss Sinclair, please reconsider! I'm not fit to work for you now. I'm no designer at this point. I'd only bring you trouble."
###Chapter 472

Olivia shook her head, her expression calm. "Problems don't frighten me," she responded with a confident smile. "I've always believed fortune smiles on those who take chances. Destiny rewards the brave. Get ready to return to the company."

She paused, studying Evelyn's hesitant face. "And if you're not prepared to reveal your identity yet, I can arrange for complete discretion. Your priority right now is—"

Glancing at her diamond-encrusted watch, Olivia added, "It's too late tonight. Tomorrow morning, I'll take you and your grandmother to Mercy Hospital. Don't stress—the staff there are completely trustworthy and will maintain absolute confidentiality."

Evelyn nodded gratefully.

Though the farmhouse showed signs of neglect, Evelyn and Beatrice had done everything possible to make Olivia comfortable. They offered their best bedding and prepared a simple but heartfelt meal. Olivia felt an unexpected lump form in her throat.

Seeing Olivia's genuine intentions, Beatrice finally dropped her defensive stance and offered a warm, grandmotherly smile.

"Miss Sinclair, you're truly Evelyn's guardian angel. She was meant for greatness—such a gifted young woman—yet she's been trapped in this difficult life because of me. My failure with Frederick weighs heavily on her." Beatrice's voice cracked. "I... I can never repay your kindness. If there's anything this old woman can do for you, just ask."

Olivia gently brushed Beatrice's silver-streaked hair. "Please, don't mention it. Evelyn did me a tremendous favor by sharing her story. Truthfully, my company is facing collapse, and uncovering the truth about the plagiarism scandal is my only hope. We're helping each other equally."

Beatrice clenched her wrinkled hands, frustration radiating from her frail frame. "Frederick and Margaret are utterly heartless. After all these years, they still won't let go." Tears glistened in her aged eyes. "They're not my blood, and they've made their contempt perfectly clear."

Later that night, after Beatrice retired, Evelyn shared another painful family secret. Beatrice had once had a biological child. When she adopted Frederick out of compassion, her own son was still alive.

Then came that fateful summer day when both boys went swimming. For reasons never explained, Beatrice's real son drowned saving Frederick's life.

Despite this unimaginable loss, Beatrice never blamed Frederick. Instead, she poured all her love into raising him. Tragically, her devotion was met with ingratitude.

To make matters worse, Margaret and Frederick had recently leaked Beatrice's location to the press as leverage against Evelyn. Their once-peaceful farmhouse had become a target for harassment, its address splashed across tabloids.

The surrounding neighbors turned a blind eye, offering no assistance. When Beatrice reached out to Frederick for help, his response chilled her: "You brought this shame upon yourself, and now you dare ask for my help? I warned you to abandon her. Let her suffer the consequences alone!" Their argument escalated until Frederick threatened to cut off all financial support.

Yet Beatrice remained unwavering in her commitment to protect Evelyn.

As Evelyn recounted these painful details, Olivia found her thoughts drifting unexpectedly to Alistair.

"My parents and paternal grandparents have all passed," Olivia said quietly, as if speaking to herself. "The only family I have left is my maternal grandfather."

The fire crackled in the hearth, casting flickering shadows across their faces.

Outside, the wind howled through the trees, carrying whispers of past regrets and future possibilities.

The night stretched before them, heavy with unspoken truths and the weight of decisions yet to be made.
###Chapter 473

The golden morning light filtered through the curtains as Olivia Sinclair sat upright in bed, her fingers clutching the crumpled photograph of her grandfather. The edges were worn from constant handling.

"But my grandfather suffers from Alzheimer's," she whispered to the empty room. "And now he's missing."

Her throat constricted as she remembered the frantic search through Halstead's streets. "I heard he might be in Newport, so I rushed here. But there's been no sign of him." A single tear escaped before she could stop it. "I don't know if I'll ever find him."

Across the breakfast table, Evelyn Whitmore studied Olivia's pale face. After a long silence, she pushed her coffee aside. "I'd rather not bring her up, but if you're looking for a lost elderly person... Margaret Sinclair might be able to help."

Olivia's head snapped up.

Evelyn continued, "Since starting university, Margaret has dedicated herself to charity work. She's rescued countless elderly and children." A bitter smile touched her lips. "There are practically no homeless seniors left in Newport."

If Alistair Kensington had wandered into Newport and become disoriented, Olivia realized with dawning hope, he might have crossed paths with Margaret. The newspapers often featured Margaret's philanthropic efforts, including her adoption program for homeless seniors.

"But," Olivia frowned, "if she found a lost person, not just a homeless one, shouldn't she have taken them to the authorities?"

She'd checked with every police station in Newport upon arrival. No one matching Alistair's description had been reported.

Evelyn shook her head. "The media praises her endlessly, but they never give specifics. Though..." She hesitated. "The seniors in her care do appear monthly for press interviews. They seem... well cared for."

Olivia's fingers flew across her phone screen. Within moments, she found last month's charity feature—Margaret surrounded by elderly beneficiaries.

Her breath caught.

There, in the crowded photograph—just the edge of a shoulder, the curve of a familiar posture—was someone she'd recognize anywhere. The image cut off before showing the face, but Olivia's heart pounded.

"That's him," she whispered.

The next morning found Olivia standing before the gleaming glass doors of Sinclair Charitable Foundation. When Margaret appeared, her practiced smile faltered for just an instant before settling into perfect composure.

"Miss Kensington," Margaret greeted coolly. "To what do we owe this... unexpected visit?"

Olivia extended her hand, her smile warm despite the tension crackling between them. "Miss Sinclair, your humanitarian work is quite impressive. A friend's relative has gone missing in Newport—an elderly gentleman with dementia. I was hoping to—"

Margaret's laugh cut through the air like shattered glass. "Olivia, spare me the act." Her lips twisted into something resembling a smile. "We both know why you're really here. Looking for dirt? Hoping to catch me mistreating these poor souls?" She stepped closer, voice dropping to a venomous whisper. "People like you aren't welcome here."

Olivia didn't flinch. With deliberate calm, she gestured toward the street where three black SUVs idled, their tinted windows revealing nothing.

The silent threat hung between them.

Margaret's eyes flickered toward the vehicles, then back to Olivia's unreadable expression. For the first time, uncertainty shadowed her perfect facade.

Olivia took a step forward. The game had changed.
###Chapter 474

Olivia blinked her wide, innocent eyes. "Miss Sinclair, how could you doubt my intentions? I'm completely sincere about this." She gestured toward the media crew behind her. "I even arranged for live coverage. You could broadcast the entire search if you'd like. I promise I won't cause any disturbances."

Her voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. "If we find my friend's missing grandfather, I'll make a public apology to you - I've already drafted the thank-you letter in advance."

Margaret Sinclair's jaw tightened visibly. Olivia had clearly become adept at manipulating public perception. Sending her away now would only create more problems.

Margaret suppressed a smirk. Thank goodness she'd discovered that jade pendant earlier. Without that crucial clue, she might never have realized the old man was the very person Olivia sought. All her preparations would have been for nothing.

With practiced grace, Margaret gestured toward the entrance. "Please, come inside."

Olivia's smile faltered slightly as she followed. Margaret's easy agreement set off alarm bells in her mind.

As they walked, Margaret casually inquired, "Do you remember what the gentleman looked like?"

Olivia carefully described several unrelated individuals, weaving an elaborate fiction. Margaret barely concealed her amusement.

The welfare home Margaret led her to was immaculate. Recent media visits had prompted thorough preparations. The elderly residents enjoyed gourmet meals and spacious accommodations. No visitor could find fault with the facilities.

Olivia scanned the unfamiliar faces, her heart sinking. No sign of Alistair. None of the features she'd memorized from photographs appeared among the residents.

Rather than confronting Margaret directly, Olivia cornered a staff member when Margaret wasn't looking. Several crisp hundred-dollar bills changed hands. "Are all the people Miss Sinclair rescued staying here?"

The staff member glanced at the money before answering reluctantly. "Yes, everyone's accounted for."

Olivia pressed further. "Absolutely certain? No special cases kept elsewhere?"

The man's expression turned impatient. "Miss Sinclair barely has time to visit as it is. You think she'd relocate some residents for personal attention?" He eyed Olivia suspiciously. "You're not here to make trouble, are you?"

Olivia shook her head quickly. "Not at all. I brought these thank-you letters specifically for Miss Sinclair."

The staff member's expression softened marginally. "That's more like it. While you're here, maybe you could help spread the word about our facility's excellent conditions. The public should know Miss Sinclair's charity work is completely genuine."

He emphasized this point several times.

Olivia's smile faded completely now, replaced by growing unease. Why the repeated assurances about their authenticity? Something didn't add up.

She decided to dig deeper, adopting a more conversational tone. "This facility is truly impressive. The meal plans show remarkable attention to nutritional balance. And the activity schedules demonstrate real concern for the residents' wellbeing."

Her eyes darted around the room, searching for any clue she might have missed. The answers were here somewhere - she just needed to ask the right questions.
###Chapter 475

The staff member's chest swelled with pride as he answered, "These are our standard daily care procedures we never neglect."

Olivia's gaze traveled over the emaciated, undernourished elderly residents, her lips curling in silent contempt. Yet she kept her mask of pleasantry firmly in place.

"Moreover, I must commend the remarkable tranquility of your facility. Not a single disturbance. The residents seem to coexist harmoniously, wouldn't you agree?"

"Without question," the staff member beamed. "We enforce strict regulations that everyone follows religiously."

"And what consequences await those who violate these rules?"

"Rule-breakers face immediate disciplinary measures," the staff member stated firmly.

Suddenly flustered, he hastily amended, "I mean verbal warnings, of course. Just verbal reprimands."

"Ah, I understand," Olivia nodded, a knowing glint flashing in her eyes.

Just then, Margaret marched over, barely containing her irritation. "Satisfied? The person you're seeking isn't here. Please leave now before you disturb our residents' rest period."

Olivia gave a polite nod and followed Margaret out of the welfare home.

Watching the departing vehicles shrink in her rearview mirror, Margaret exhaled in relief. Rather than driving Olivia back to the city center, she abruptly pulled over at a remote countryside location.

"My apologies," Margaret said, eyes glinting with malice. "Urgent matters require my attention. You'll have to manage from here." The deserted rural road offered no taxis for miles.

Olivia recognized the deliberate snub. Unshaken, she handed Margaret a sealed document.

Margaret unfolded it with a scowl that morphed into shock as she read.

Olivia allowed herself a small smile. "I nearly forgot my primary purpose for visiting today. This is a court summons, Miss Sinclair. I've filed a lawsuit against you. I'd advise consulting your attorney and ensuring your punctual appearance."

Margaret's fingers crushed the document edges. "You dare? This is your company's blunder, not mine! Who do you think you are? I won't dignify this with my presence - I'm completely innocent!"

"The courts will determine innocence," Olivia countered calmly. "You pride yourself on justice. Does the prospect of defending yourself frighten you?"

Margaret's eyes blazed with fury. With a final glare, she slammed the car window shut and barked, "Drive!"

The vehicle screeched away, leaving Olivia standing in a cloud of dust. Moments later, another car pulled up smoothly before her.

Behind the wheel sat Evelyn, navigating effortlessly despite her slight limp.

It had been ages since Evelyn ventured outdoors, and nervousness tinged her voice. "Miss Kensington, should I wear a disguise? If someone recognizes me with you, it might cause complications."
###Chapter 476

Olivia sank into the plush leather seat with an exhausted sigh, massaging her temples. "Just drive. I need to rest. No masks - they draw more attention than they prevent. I've got this handled."

Evelyn Whitmore's curiosity burned about how Olivia planned to conceal her identity. She never expected the dramatic transformation Olivia had orchestrated.

Olivia had completely reinvented Evelyn - from a new designer wardrobe to a total image makeover. The change was staggering. The frail, broken woman was gone.

Now Evelyn stood before the mirror in a flowing ivory gown, her hair cascading in luxurious extensions that shimmered like liquid gold. The ensemble gave her an air of effortless elegance, cleverly disguising her physical limitations. Still, her uneven gait betrayed her. Noticing this, Olivia arranged for a discreet wheelchair with several bodyguards standing by.

Evelyn barely recognized her own reflection. "This...this isn't me," she whispered.

Olivia approached, resting a reassuring hand on her shoulder. "You're a Kensington student now. And your name stays secret."

"Gregory Thornton?" Evelyn gasped. "But he's a famous artist! People will know immediately."

Olivia's lips curved into a knowing smile. "Trust me. With me beside you, no one will question a thing." She handed Evelyn a thick dossier.

As Evelyn scanned the documents, her hands trembled. "The International Jewelry Design Competition? I can't possibly... Miss Kensington, this is too much."

Olivia's expression hardened. "You came here to reclaim what's yours, didn't you? Then commit fully or don't bother. Half measures won't work here."

Evelyn shook her head vehemently. "I'm not afraid. I just don't want to be a burden. You've already given me so much."

Olivia's gaze turned steely. "Would you prefer your grandmother went to the hospital alone?"

Guilt washed over Evelyn as she bowed her head. "I'm sorry. That was thoughtless of me."

"Don't let me hear that again," Olivia said firmly.

Evelyn nodded quickly. "Understood."

Satisfied, Olivia escorted Evelyn to her new quarters - a ground floor suite arranged specially to accommodate her needs. To maintain the illusion, Olivia kept Evelyn's true identity secret even from her own family, referring to her only as Miss Kensington.

Little Isabelle was instantly enchanted by their mysterious new guest. She circled Evelyn like an excited puppy before turning to Olivia with wide, hopeful eyes. "Mama, is she my new sister? Can she share my room?"

With Olivia rarely home and Alistair's constant absences, Isabelle often felt lonely in the sprawling mansion. Olivia knelt, gently smoothing her daughter's hair. "Yes, darling, you can think of her as your sister. But remember, we'll have a special guest arriving soon - an elderly lady. I expect perfect manners."

Evelyn's head snapped up, eyes brimming with disbelief. "You're bringing Grandmother here? That's too generous. After everything you've already—" She caught Olivia's warning look and swallowed her words.

Evelyn's voice dropped to a whisper thick with emotion. "I can never repay your kindness."
###Chapter 477

Olivia shook her head. "I'm bringing Beatrice here for two reasons." Her voice carried quiet authority. "First, she'll receive better medical care at Mercy Hospital. I've arranged for top specialists to examine her."

She paused, letting the words sink in. "Second, since you're now working for Sinclair Enterprises, it's more practical for you both to stay here at the estate." Olivia's gaze softened. "If Beatrice remained at home while you worked here, you'd be constantly worried. This way, you can focus better."

Evelyn's eyes shimmered with unshed tears. The depth of Olivia's consideration overwhelmed her. She couldn't possibly refuse such generosity.

The medical report came sooner than expected. Beatrice's condition resulted from prolonged malnutrition, but the prognosis was positive. With proper nutrition and care, she would regain her strength completely.

As the court date approached, news of Olivia's lawsuit against Margaret spread rapidly across social media. The scandal dominated every conversation, drawing intense scrutiny toward Margaret and Sinclair Enterprises.

Margaret seized the spotlight, hosting three emotional livestreams daily. She perfected the art of the tearful confession, portraying herself as the helpless victim of corporate bullying.

"My charity work has always been my life's purpose," she sobbed during one broadcast. "I never imagined fighting for basic rights would pit me against such powerful forces."

She accused Olivia of using her wealth and Kensington family connections to manipulate the legal system. "If she succeeds, I'll be blacklisted from philanthropy work," Margaret wept dramatically. "I might even be forced to leave Westhaven forever!"

Her performances were masterful. Each tearful plea ignited her followers' outrage, sending them flooding Sinclair Enterprises' social media with vitriolic comments. They fantasized about confronting Olivia directly, but she'd learned from past experiences.

Despite Margaret's relentless online attacks, Olivia maintained radio silence. Her residence remained an impenetrable secret, frustrating internet sleuths who tried in vain to locate her.

Growing desperate, Margaret resorted to extreme measures. She leaked Olivia's private phone number, only to discover it had been disconnected. The dead end infuriated her.

Then came an unexpected twist. Hackers drawn to the drama uncovered explosive information - but not what Margaret had hoped for. Instead of damaging Olivia, their discovery backfired spectacularly.

"The Kensington family?" one shocked commentator wrote. "Olivia Sinclair is a Kensington? That changes everything."

Uninformed detractors scoffed. "What's so special about them? Just another rich family, right?"

"You clearly don't understand," came the reply. "The Kensingtons aren't just wealthy - they're old money with centuries of influence. They relocated abroad during the last century's conflicts. Their international connections and resources dwarf most domestic fortunes."

The revelation sent shockwaves through the online community. "Margaret picked a fight with someone far beyond her league," one observer noted. "This won't end well for her."

Yet Margaret's most devoted supporters refused to believe the truth. "Kensington family? That's ridiculous!" they protested. "Stop spreading lies to protect that corporate bully!"

The battle lines were drawn, the stage set for a confrontation that would reveal more than anyone anticipated.
###Chapter 478

"Just because she's rich, we're supposed to worship the ground she walks on?"

"Exactly! Keep your voice down. This is clearly a case of privilege and power being abused. We should stand with the underdog, not cower before bullies."

Olivia Sinclair remained unfazed by the online storm of insults and debates swirling around her. If anything, she seemed to thrive on it. The controversy meant more attention for Sinclair Enterprises, perfectly setting the stage for her next strategic move.

Meanwhile, Margaret Sinclair seethed with barely contained rage. Despite her attempts to expose Olivia's true nature, she found herself drowning in a sea of cyberbullying. One particularly cutting comment claimed she wasn't even fit to be Olivia's maid. The words burned through Margaret like acid.

Margaret's room became a warzone as she hurled objects across the floor, her curses directed at Olivia. "Who does that Sinclair bitch think she is? Just born with a silver spoon in her mouth! And these brainless netizens - they think I'm beneath her?" As her tantrum reached its peak, the door creaked open.

Alistair Kensington entered, his face immediately twisting in disapproval at the sight of his disheveled granddaughter amidst the destruction. Without a word, he turned to leave. Margaret gritted her teeth, forcing sweetness into her tone as she rushed after him. "Grandfather, didn't you promise I'm your granddaughter? When will you take me home?"

Alistair studied Margaret with weary eyes. "The Kensington estate isn't safe. You're better off staying away. Distance from the family will protect you from their schemes."

Margaret's anxiety spiked. "Grandfather, you're not thinking clearly. We're family - why would family plot against each other? You're ill and paranoid. We should go home."

Alistair remained unmoved. "What's the rush? Do you think life among the wealthy Kensingtons would be so much better? My true granddaughter wouldn't be so obsessed with wealth."

Tears of frustration sprang to Margaret's eyes as she spun away. "Do you even care that your granddaughter is being bullied to the breaking point? I just want the protection of my family. Is that so wrong?" Silence was her only answer.

In desperation, Margaret produced a jade pendant, her voice cracking. "Grandfather, remember this? You gave it to my mother. Said it would be how you'd recognize her. I found you with it, yet now you deny me."

Her hand trembled as she continued, "If it means nothing, why give it to me? Fine then - I don't want it!" With dramatic flourish, she hurled the pendant into the wastebasket.

Alistair startled into action, scrambling to retrieve the discarded heirloom. He dusted it carefully, his frown deepening as he regarded his sobbing granddaughter.

His voice softened unexpectedly. "Give me time to think. Don't worry - if you're truly my granddaughter, I won't let anyone harm you."

Margaret's face lit up with triumph as she clutched Alistair's hand. "Oh Grandfather, you're too kind!"

Yet Alistair's gaze remained distant and cold. His fractured memory held only fragments - he distinctly remembered the jade belonging to his true granddaughter. But if Margaret wasn't her, why did she possess it?

Trapped in this gilded cage - Margaret forbade him from leaving, claiming his confusion made the outside world dangerous - Alistair realized the truth might only be found back at the Kensington estate.

Meanwhile, as online attention reached fever pitch around Sinclair Enterprises, Olivia made her move - announcing the company's participation in the prestigious Royal Jewelry Design Competition, igniting fresh waves of speculation and debate.
###Chapter 479

The online comments exploded with outrage.

"Sinclair Enterprises dares to compete in this design competition? Are they planning to plagiarize again?"

"Stop stealing Margaret's creative work!"

"Let's see what ridiculous performance Sinclair Enterprises will put on this time."

A lone voice of reason chimed in, "Maybe Sinclair Enterprises actually hired a talented designer this round." But they were quickly drowned out by the mob.

The most vicious comment read, "Everyone knows their designer copied Margaret's work for years before getting caught."

"Such a prestigious company should investigate these claims properly," another user wrote. "But they clearly underestimated Margaret's threat level."

"This corporation has no ethics when it comes to design integrity."

Margaret Sinclair expertly manipulated the online narrative. Without directly naming Sinclair Enterprises, she painted herself as the wronged party - detailing the emotional devastation of discovering her stolen work and the uphill battle to protect her rights.

Her final post hinted at newfound resilience. "No one can silence me anymore," she wrote, suggesting she'd broken free from corporate intimidation.

The speculation ran wild. "Margaret, did Sinclair Enterprises block you from the competition?" one fan asked. She responded the next day with nothing but a shushing emoji, letting imaginations run wild.

Olivia Sinclair and Evelyn Whitmore monitored the situation closely. Evelyn clenched her fists. "She's using the same old tricks to smear me. After all these years, she hasn't changed her tactics one bit."

Olivia placed a calming hand on her shoulder. "Her methods may be predictable, but they're effective. Just follow my plan exactly, and everything will work out."

Their conversation was interrupted by Beatrice Whitmore hobbling out on her cane, with little Isabelle trailing behind. "Grandma Beatrice, please don't worry," the child said earnestly. "Listen to Mommy."

Both women rushed to intercept her. Evelyn caught Beatrice's arm gently. "Grandmother, what are you trying to do?"

Tears streaked down Beatrice's wrinkled face. "I can't just sit by! What are Margaret's true intentions? If only I'd known... I never should have taken in her father from that orphanage. I raised an ungrateful son who fathered this viper!"

Evelyn pulled her grandmother into a tight embrace, her own eyes glistening. "Grandmother, I understand your pain, but there's nothing you can do now. If you truly want to help Miss Sinclair, please don't complicate matters."

Beatrice turned watery eyes toward Olivia, grasping her hand weakly. "This is all my fault. I'm just a useless old woman now."

Olivia squeezed her hand back firmly. "Beatrice, that's not true. Actually, I need your help with something very important."

Hope flickered in Beatrice's eyes as she wiped her tears. "Really? I can still be useful?"

Olivia's smile was warm and genuine. "Absolutely vital."

She leaned in to whisper instructions in Beatrice's ear. The older woman nodded slowly, though hesitation still lingered in her expression.

###Chapter 480

Olivia Sinclair's lips curved into a feline smile as she regarded the elderly woman before her. "Miss Kensington," she murmured, her voice dripping with honeyed warmth, "Your wisdom is precisely why I need you. Though time may have silvered your hair, it's sharpened your mind like a well-honed blade."

Beatrice Whitmore adjusted her spectacles, the gold frames catching the light. "My dear, at my age, one wrong move could topple your carefully constructed house of cards. Are you certain this old fox still has the cunning you require?"

Olivia's eyes sparkled with unspoken schemes. "Darling Beatrice, if events unfold as we've planned, we'll vanish like morning mist. No one will suspect a thing." She reached out to squeeze the older woman's hand. "There's no one I trust more for this delicate matter."

Evelyn Whitmore fidgeted nervously nearby, her fingers twisting the fabric of her skirt. "Miss Sinclair, please - let me handle this instead. Beatrice shouldn't—"

"Child," Beatrice cut in with a fond but firm tone, "Stay with Olivia where you're needed. This old bones still have some fight left in them." She winked conspiratorially at Olivia.

Evelyn opened her mouth like a fish gasping for air, then closed it again at Olivia's subtle headshake. The younger woman placed a reassuring hand on Evelyn's shoulder, the silent gesture speaking volumes.

As Beatrice departed with purposeful strides, Olivia's expression transformed. The warmth drained from her face, leaving behind the calculating sharpness of a winter's gale. "Evelyn," she said, each word measured and precise, "This is your moment to unleash the lioness I know lurks beneath that demure exterior. Win this competition, and you'll carve both your name and Sinclair Enterprises into history books."

She leaned closer, her perfume wrapping around them like an invisible cloak. "Understand this - my generosity isn't charity. I invest only in those who prove their worth. Do we have an understanding?"

Evelyn's spine straightened, her chin lifting with newfound determination. "You won't regret giving me this opportunity. I'll move heaven and earth to succeed."

In the frenzied days leading to the competition, Olivia became a whirlwind of activity, dividing her time between corporate battles and personal obligations. Sinclair Enterprises teetered on a precipice - its reputation in tatters, its financial arteries hemorrhaging funds.

Just as Olivia contemplated the risks of a potentially ruinous venture, her phone buzzed with unexpected hope. The director's voice crackled through the receiver. "We've got interest from a major client, but he's hesitant to sign. Wants to meet you personally first. Probably heard the rumors. This could be our lifeline."

Fatigue momentarily lifted from Olivia's shoulders as hope flickered to life. "Perfect. Schedule it for tonight. Pull out all the stops - I want this man eating out of our hands by dessert."

The director hesitated. "Miss Sinclair, with all due respect... morale is crumbling. Resignations are piling up. I'm barely keeping my head above water."

Olivia exhaled slowly, weighing her words. "You've been our rock during this storm. Stay the course, and when we emerge victorious, your loyalty won't be forgotten."

The director's voice warmed with gratitude. "Thank you." After hanging up, contact details for the client's assistant appeared on Olivia's screen.

She'd worried her direct approach might seem too transparent, but Benjamin Wright agreed to meet with surprising eagerness. With the appointment secured, Olivia rushed home to change into something that balanced professional polish with subtle allure.

Thirty minutes before their reservation, Olivia arrived at the exclusive restaurant. A waiter guided her through dimly lit corridors to a private dining room. As the door swung open, a thick cloud of cigar smoke assaulted her senses.

Olivia's nose wrinkled imperceptibly as she forced a gracious smile. "Mr. Wright? Olivia Sinclair. A pleasure to finally meet the man behind those intriguing emails."
###Chapter 481

The dim lighting of the private dining room cast long shadows across the table where a heavyset man sat alone. His ill-fitting suit hung awkwardly on his frame, the wrinkles giving him an almost comical appearance that contrasted sharply with the upscale restaurant's ambiance.

Benjamin Wright tilted his head, his beady eyes narrowing as they raked over Olivia Sinclair's form with the clinical detachment of someone appraising livestock. Olivia suppressed a shudder but kept her professional mask firmly in place.

This could still be her potential client. She wouldn't let personal discomfort ruin a business opportunity - though every instinct screamed at her to walk away immediately.

The silence stretched between them until Benjamin suddenly burst into laughter, the sound grating against Olivia's nerves like nails on chalkboard. Maintaining her composure, she poured him a cup of coffee with steady hands, the fragrant steam rising between them like a fragile barrier.

"Mr. Wright," Olivia began, cutting through the tension, "I understand you're considering a substantial order but have reservations about the contract. Could you clarify your concerns? Whether it's pricing or design specifications, we can certainly negotiate terms."

Benjamin's laughter turned into a wheezing chuckle as he abruptly stood and moved to sit beside her, his bulk pressing uncomfortably close. Olivia's grip tightened around her coffee cup until her knuckles turned white, resisting the powerful urge to throw the scalding liquid in his face.

Then she felt it - his damp palm sliding around her waist with reptilian slowness.

Reacting instantly, Olivia delivered a sharp elbow to his ribs. "Are we here to conduct business or not?" she demanded, her voice like tempered steel.

Benjamin sneered, his breath reeking of stale tobacco. "Business? Don't play coy with me. I know your type - pretending to be some prim businesswoman when all you really want is access to my bank account. I'm not some naive boy you can manipulate."

Olivia's confusion cut through her anger. This wasn't Benjamin Wright? Had she entered the wrong private dining room? Impossible - the hostess had specifically directed her here.

Ignoring the man's disgusting advances, Olivia stood to call for assistance. Before she could move, Benjamin's meaty hand clamped around her wrist, his overpowering cologne mixing unpleasantly with body odor.

"Enough games," he panted, his free hand groping at her blouse. "I've got another appointment soon, so let's make this quick."

"Get your hands off me!" Olivia's shout echoed through the room as she twisted violently in his grasp.

When he didn't relent, Olivia drove her knee upward, the pointed toe of her designer pump connecting painfully with his shin. As Benjamin howled in pain, she wrenched free and bolted for the door.

The hallway outside spun into view as Olivia burst through the doorway - only to collide violently with another figure.

"Wait, viewers! I'm just about to meet my top patron from the fan club who's been so supportive. Everyone say- OOF!"

The impact sent both women staggering. Olivia barely registered the phone screen broadcasting their collision live to thousands of viewers before recognizing the woman she'd nearly knocked over - Margaret Sinclair, social media influencer and perpetual thorn in Olivia's side.

Margaret's camera captured every detail - Olivia's wild eyes, her mussed hair, the panic written across her normally composed features. The realization that this humiliating moment was being streamed to half the city froze Olivia in place.

The door behind her creaked ominously as Benjamin's shadow fell across them both.
###Chapter 482

The man's frantic voice pierced through the private dining room. "Sweetheart, don't leave!"

He burst through the door moments later. His expression morphed from anticipation to shock when he saw Olivia standing there. "Oh... Ms. Sinclair. What a surprise."

Olivia's face drained of color as if she'd seen a ghost. Her trembling finger pointed accusingly at him. "You... You told me you were female online!"

The man's eyes darted nervously around the room. "I never actually specified my gender—"

Yet his social media profile had featured a woman's photo and all his comments used distinctly feminine language.

A cold realization washed over Olivia. She'd been mere moments away from walking into a predator's trap. Had Margaret not collided with her at the entrance, the consequences could have been unthinkable.

But gratitude was the furthest thing from Olivia's mind. Behind her shocked expression, wheels of malice were already turning.

Spotting the live stream camera, the man raised his voice dramatically. "Ms. Sinclair! I'm your biggest fan! I've spent thousands supporting your channel!" He dramatically pointed at Margaret. "This woman came onto me first!"

Margaret seized the moment to contact reception. After verifying her reservation details, the staff assured her security would arrive shortly.

Drawing a steadying breath, Margaret leveled an icy glare at both the man and Olivia. "I came onto you?" Her voice dripped with disdain.

Olivia's acting skills surfaced instantly. Tears welled in her eyes as she joined the man's accusations. "Margaret, how could you? I know your company's struggling, but targeting my fan? This is despicable!"

The live chat exploded with venom:

"Pathetic! Some heiress she turned out to be."
"Obviously watched Olivia's stream yesterday about meeting a fan here."
"Classic gold-digger move. Probably planned to blackmail him."
"Wait, isn't the real issue this creep pretending to be a woman?"

Olivia's tear-streaked face twisted in betrayal. "First you bully me professionally, now you set up this disgusting ambush?"

Margaret straightened her jacket with deliberate calm. "First," her voice carried crisp authority, "I reserved this room three days ago for a business meeting. Second, this man immediately made inappropriate advances when I entered."

She pulled out her phone. "I'm happy to involve the police. They can determine who's telling the truth." Her gaze locked onto Olivia. "You claim this is your reservation? Show me the confirmation."

Olivia's tears froze mid-swipe. Panic flashed across her face. She hadn't booked the room—her "fan" had assured her it would be empty. With her celebrity status, she'd assumed the restaurant would accommodate her. Never anticipating Margaret would be the actual reservation holder, Olivia now stood exposed without proof.
###Chapter 483

"You claimed you were here to meet a client, but shouldn't you at least know your client's name and appearance beforehand? Didn't it occur to you this wasn't your intended meeting?" Margaret Sinclair demanded, her voice dripping with irritation.

Olivia Sinclair froze, caught in the spotlight of accusation. Lately, she'd been drowning in work, barely keeping her head above water. The director had simply mentioned the other party wished to remain anonymous until their face-to-face meeting. That's precisely why she'd booked this particular private room.

As Olivia remained silent, Margaret's lips curled into a triumphant smirk. "Olivia, if you've made a mistake, just admit it. I'm willing to give you a chance to fix this, but you need to apologize to both me and my fan."

The man beside Margaret nodded vigorously. "Exactly! You owe us an apology. My reputation would've been ruined if Margaret hadn't arrived when she did."

"Why should I apologize?" Olivia countered, her voice steady despite the pounding in her chest. "The front desk staff and security are on their way. The truth will be clear soon enough."

Olivia maintained her composure while Margaret and the man exchanged nervous glances. Suddenly, the man grabbed Olivia's wrist and yanked her toward the room. "Fine. We'll wait for them. But you're not going anywhere. We're settling this now. Get inside and explain yourself."

Margaret shoved Olivia forward, adding, "If you're innocent, prove it. Walk in there and clear this up."

Panic surged through Olivia as she struggled against their grip. She wasn't naive - she knew exactly what being forced into that room meant. She couldn't verify anything under these circumstances. But with Margaret in front and the man behind, they were effectively trapping her.

"What's happening here?" A deep, icy voice cut through the tension like a knife.

With each approaching footstep, an unmistakable aura of authority filled the hallway. Margaret whirled around, her eyes widening in shock. She never expected to encounter Liam Blackwood here.

Margaret's mind raced. Had Liam seen her live broadcast yesterday? Was that why he'd appeared? It made sense. Given Liam's unpredictable nature, he probably regretted sending her away before. Smug with this thought, she tightened her grip on Olivia.

Seizing the momentary distraction, Olivia wrenched herself free. Liam rushed toward them.

Margaret immediately brightened, stepping forward with a dazzling smile. "You came!" But Liam didn't even glance her way, striding right past her.

Liam reached Olivia and gently took her hand. Though wearing a mask, the concern in his eyes was unmistakable. "Are you hurt? This is my fault. I shouldn't have been late. Please don't be angry. Yell at me if you must, just don't shut me out."

Olivia pulled her hand away with a scoff. "Mr. Blackwood, haven't you noticed? Miss Sinclair seems eager for your attention. I'll leave you to it."

Liam quickly caught Olivia's hand again, stopping her retreat. Always careful with his words around her, he said deliberately, "Olivia, I was detained. I apologize. And Miss Sinclair, you said? Who exactly is she? I don't recall."

At his words, Margaret staggered as if physically struck. Her face drained of color, yet she forced herself closer. "Sir, it's me. You rescued me the other day. You took me into your home. You must remember me. Did Miss Sinclair say something about me? I've been wondering why you sent me away that day."

Margaret's carefully crafted words sowed confusion among her live stream audience.
###Chapter 484

The live chat exploded with shocked reactions.

"Wait... Olivia's supposed savior is connected to Margaret? Ugh, they truly deserve each other."

"Are you serious? Liam wasn't even interested in Margaret. She threw herself at him first."

"This is absolutely hilarious. Margaret just got publicly humiliated."

Only then did Liam turn to face Margaret, his smirk icy and deliberate. "The sole reason I tolerated your presence was for your assistance in locating someone. But your constant flirtation disgusts me. I was the one who dismissed you, so if you want to start trouble, aim it at me. Why involve Olivia?"

Margaret's face crumpled with heartbreak, tears glistening in her eyes. She inhaled sharply before forcing out, "Fine. This is all my fault. But everyone witnessed her seducing my fan and lying about meeting a client today. How could she not recognize her own client? And considering Sinclair Enterprises' current situation, who in their right mind would order jewelry from—"

Her accusations redirected the crowd's attention to Olivia, her gaze sharp as knives. Liam opened his mouth to respond, but Olivia silenced him with a raised hand, her stare glacial. At that moment, the restaurant manager arrived promptly, flanked by a squad of security personnel.

Margaret gestured dramatically, jabbing a finger toward Olivia with venom in her voice. "She's causing a disturbance. Remove her immediately."

To Margaret's shock, the manager ignored her completely, walking past with measured steps. He stopped before Olivia and bowed deeply. "Miss Sinclair, my sincerest apologies for this unpleasantness. Where is the instigator? Rest assured, we'll handle this matter at once."

Margaret's jaw dropped. She stood frozen, her accusing finger still extended toward Olivia. The live chat erupted into frenzied debate.

"So Olivia booked the private room? How? Wasn't it supposed to be Margaret?"

"Stop defending Margaret already. The VIP rooms here require membership for reservations."

Reading these comments, Margaret's face flushed crimson. She yanked out her membership card and shoved it at the manager. "Look carefully! I'm a member! This woman just arrived in Newport recently and hasn't spent a dime here. How could she possibly qualify?"

Though Margaret hadn't booked this specific room, she refused to believe Olivia could have. She'd deny it even if evidence proved otherwise. Besides, Olivia's alleged client hadn't shown up. Perhaps this was all an elaborate bluff.

The manager regarded Margaret with open disdain. "Miss, your membership tier doesn't permit booking this VIP suite. You've clearly misunderstood. Please refrain from causing further disruptions."

Margaret's face burned with humiliation. The manager turned back to Olivia, his demeanor reverent. "While Miss Sinclair may not have made purchases here, she does hold our highest-tier membership, which she used to reserve this room."

Liam stepped forward, closing the distance to where Margaret stood defeated. His contemptuous gaze raked over her. "Didn't you claim her client meeting was fabricated? That no one would buy from Sinclair Enterprises?"

"Let me clarify. I'm the client she's meeting, and I intend to make the purchase. Miss Sinclair, you orchestrated this entire spectacle to damage Olivia's reputation. Should Olivia choose, she could file charges against you right now."
###Chapter 485

Olivia was rendered speechless, her words dying in her throat. A deep flush of humiliation crept up her cheeks as she felt the weight of thousands of judgmental eyes watching through her live stream. Her fingers trembled uncontrollably as she fumbled to end the broadcast.

Outside the private room, Olivia stood frozen as Liam and Natalie disappeared behind the ornate doors. The whispers and mocking laughter of the crowd cut through her like knives. But the online comments were far worse - a torrent of vicious remarks and curses flooded her screen.

For the first time in her carefully constructed life, Olivia Sinclair faced complete public humiliation.

Inside the private room, Natalie yanked her hand from Liam's grasp. Her expression turned to ice as she took a seat, arms crossed defensively across her chest.

Liam took two cautious steps forward but kept his distance. "Are you still upset? I never meant for you to face that alone. I didn't want you to get hurt."

Natalie's lips curled into a bitter smile. "Hurt? I can handle myself perfectly well, with or without your dramatic entrance. I don't want to do business with you. Please leave."

Panic flashed across Liam's striking features. "Why? My offer is completely genuine. There are no hidden motives here."

Natalie's piercing gaze remained glacial, her chest rising slightly with suppressed emotion.

"Sinclair Enterprises is a multi-billion dollar corporation. You could get anything you want through normal channels. Why this ridiculous charade? Did you think this was funny? Or did you imagine you were doing me some grand favor?"

Her voice grew sharper with each word. "First you create problems, then you swoop in as the savior? Is this some twisted test of yours? Do you get some perverse pleasure from watching me struggle?"

Liam's handsome face contorted with distress as he removed his mask in one swift motion. "That's not it at all. My only intention was to eventually hand Sinclair Enterprises over to you. But the company has serious underlying issues. Back then, I worried you'd recognize me before you fully understood the company's problems."

His voice dropped to an urgent whisper. "I thought if you solved these challenges yourself, the board would respect you more. I never anticipated you'd uncover my identity so quickly." He ran a hand through his dark hair in frustration. "I'm desperate, Natalie. You kept avoiding me, so I panicked and came up with this stupid plan."

Natalie pressed her lips into a thin line, the tension between them palpable. Despite her anger, she couldn't ignore the pang of discomfort seeing his distressed expression. With finality, she pointed to the door. "This deal is off. Leave now."

The light in Liam's eyes dimmed as he recognized her genuine fury. Without argument, he turned toward the exit.

Just as his hand touched the doorknob, Natalie's voice stopped him cold. "Are you free tonight? Isabelle hasn't seen you in weeks. She keeps asking about you."

A slow, genuine smile spread across Liam's face - a rare sight for anyone outside his inner circle. "I'll wait downstairs. We can go together."

Natalie shook her head, still refusing to meet his gaze. "No, I have other arrangements."

Liam hesitated, remembering the whispered conversation he'd overheard earlier. Though he suspected she was planning something, he bit back his questions and exited quietly.

###Chapter 486

The moment Liam Blackwood stepped out, a sharp knock resonated through the office door. Olivia Sinclair had already prepared a contingency plan. Though the director's assurances had sounded convincing, she remained unconvinced without tangible proof.

Her instincts told her this could either be someone playing games or a well-meaning acquaintance trying to help discreetly. The truth became clear when she learned Liam was the mysterious client requesting this meeting.

"Please, come in," Olivia said, straightening her posture. The door swung open to reveal a sharply dressed man carrying an antique folding fan that seemed oddly out of place in the modern office.

Alexander Montgomery offered a polite nod and a practiced smile. "Forgive my abruptness. My schedule is rather packed today. If we could proceed directly to business matters? Taking a seat would imply I'm staying for pleasantries, which wouldn't serve either of us well."

Olivia wasn't surprised by his bluntness. Her research had revealed Alexander came from Montgomery Jewelers, the most prestigious gemstone dynasty in Newport, possibly all of Eldermere. Their family controlled multiple mines and pearl fisheries across three continents.

For Sinclair Enterprises' future expansion, Olivia knew securing Alexander's favor was crucial.

Despite his refusal to sit, Olivia calmly poured him a cup of coffee. Something about her graceful movements caught Alexander's attention, his gaze lingering longer than intended.

"That aroma is exquisite," Alexander remarked, genuine appreciation coloring his tone. Olivia gestured invitingly. "Would you care for a taste?"

After a brief hesitation, Alexander took the seat opposite her. As they sipped the rich brew, the initial tension dissolved. "I wouldn't have pegged you as a coffee connoisseur," Alexander admitted with an appraising look. "Most heiresses wouldn't bother mastering such skills."

Rather than taking offense, Olivia reached into her designer bag and produced her certified barista credentials. Alexander choked slightly on his coffee.

"I lost my voice once," Olivia explained casually. "After recovering, I threw myself into every interest I'd neglected. This certification might seem trivial, but I hoped it might help break the ice today."

Alexander found himself both embarrassed and impressed by her candor. He shook his head with a wry smile.

"Our families have done business before, but Sinclair Enterprises' reputation has taken quite a hit recently. Frankly, most industry insiders are betting on your collapse."

Olivia nodded understandingly. "Your concerns are valid. But please review this first." She slid a design portfolio across the table.

Alexander's expression shifted from skepticism to genuine admiration as he examined the sketches. "This is remarkable work - lightyears beyond that plagiarism scandal." A shadow flickered through Olivia's eyes.

###Chapter 487

The afternoon sunlight streamed through the café windows as Olivia Sinclair stirred her latte with deliberate calm. "To be honest, it's the same designer who was caught up in that plagiarism scandal," she said, watching Alexander Montgomery's reaction.

Alexander's eyebrows shot up, but he remained silent, the air between them thickening with unspoken thoughts. Olivia took another sip, savoring the rich flavor while giving him space to process. By the time she finished her third cup, Alexander finally stood. "I'll consider your proposal, Miss Kensington," he murmured before striding out.

The moment the Montgomery family car disappeared from the underground garage, Sebastian Montgomery started the engine. He glanced at Liam Blackwood, who reclined in the backseat with his eyes closed. "Mr. Blackwood, should we follow him?"

Liam rubbed his temples, exhaling slowly. "No need. How long was he with Olivia?"

Sebastian checked his watch. "Only twenty minutes. That's hardly enough time to negotiate anything."

Yet Liam smirked. "You clearly don’t know Olivia well enough."

His amusement faded as quickly as it had come. "I barely got five minutes with her before she kicked me out. Who am I to judge?"

Sebastian nearly responded but held his tongue, sensing Liam’s bitter tone. Then, a notification chimed—Olivia’s text. The stormy expression on Liam’s face vanished instantly. The message was brief: "Pick up Isabelle."

Liam snapped into action, urging Sebastian to drive faster. It wasn’t just an order—it felt like a lifeline.

During their stay in Westhaven, Olivia had enrolled Isabelle in a specialized class to keep her engaged, knowing the girl would grow restless at home. Winston usually arrived an hour early to collect her. But today, Olivia had summoned Liam instead, sparing Winston the need to mobilize security.

Despite Liam’s past failures, Olivia had always believed he was a good father. But that belief was about to shatter.

Within half an hour of receiving Olivia’s message, Liam stood outside the building, scanning the area. No sign of Isabelle.

Unease prickled at his skin as he stepped inside. Then, a faint sob reached his ears—Isabelle’s. His pulse spiked as he rushed toward the sound.

Pushing through the door, his stomach dropped at the sight before him.

Isabelle sat hunched over, tears streaking her cheeks, while Eleanor Blackwood loomed above her. Though Eleanor’s smile was gentle, her eyes were ice.

"Come now, darling," Eleanor cooed, her voice honeyed but sharp. "You broke my things. Surely you know how to apologize?"

Isabelle lifted her chin, defiance burning through her tears. "That’s a lie! I didn’t break anything! You hit me first! You should be sorry!"

Eleanor’s smile flickered, replaced by something darker. Oliver Hart stepped in hesitantly. "Miss, she’s just a child. She doesn’t understand—"

Eleanor cut him off with a glare. "Oh, please. She may be a child, but I can’t stand the sight of her."

Liam surged forward, scooping Isabelle into his arms. He leveled a glare at Eleanor. "What the hell are you doing here?"

Eleanor’s expression melted into sweetness, but her words were venom. "I couldn’t find you, so I had to take matters into my own hands. Liam, why did you lie to me? You and Olivia were married. You even have a child. Did you think I wouldn’t find out?"

###Chapter 488

Liam's expression darkened at Eleanor's accusatory tone. "I have nothing to hide. This doesn't concern you. Yes, Olivia and I were married, and we have a child together. Even after our divorce, they remain my responsibility. I've tolerated your interference out of respect for your brother. Stay away from them - that's my final warning."

Tears welled up in Eleanor's eyes. Little Isabelle, hearing Liam claim to be her father, began struggling in his arms. "You're lying! My daddy would never leave Mommy! He's working overseas, not here! Stop telling lies!"

Regret flooded Liam as he realized he'd revealed too much to Isabelle. His temper had gotten the better of him during the heated exchange with Eleanor. Concerned for Isabelle's emotional state, he reluctantly set her down. To his horror, the child bolted away, her tiny frame shaking with sobs.

Liam moved to chase after Isabelle when Eleanor suddenly grabbed his wrist with surprising strength. No one could explain how the usually delicate woman had become so forceful. Her grip was unyielding, her fingers like steel bands around his arm.

Fortunately, Sebastian and Oliver noticed the commotion and rushed outside. "Eleanor!" Liam's patience snapped as he violently wrenched his arm free, putting all his strength into breaking her hold.

The sudden movement sent Eleanor sprawling onto the pavement. Tears streamed down her face in an uncontrollable flood as she gazed up at Liam with shimmering, sorrowful eyes. Despite her fragile beauty and vulnerable expression, Liam's gaze remained icy and detached.

A bittersweet smile curved Eleanor's lips even as tears continued to fall. "You promised my brother you'd marry me and stay with me. I heard it with my own ears. Why deny it now? Is it because of that woman? How could you break your word, Liam?"

Her eyes dulled as she stared blankly at Liam's retreating back, still in shock. The sudden vibration of her phone snapped her back to reality. The message from her doctor read: "Miss, your condition has deteriorated significantly. Immediate treatment is imperative. Further delay could lead to irreversible consequences."

Eleanor barely glanced at the screen. Slowly, her eyes darkened with a venomous glint.

Liam sprinted outside, but Sebastian, Oliver, and Isabelle had vanished. Just as he reached for his phone to call Sebastian, a horrifying screech of tires on asphalt shattered the air, followed by a child's terrified scream and panicked shouts from bystanders.

Liam's heart stopped.

Meanwhile, Olivia was deep in thought about her collaboration with Alexander when the hospital's call came. The news struck her like a physical blow, leaving her dizzy and disoriented.

She barely remembered the frantic drive to Mercy Hospital. Her legs threatened to give way as she stumbled from the car, nearly collapsing on the pavement.

The ominous red glow of the operating room sign intensified Olivia's desperation. Tears streaming down her face, she lunged at Liam, grabbing his collar with both hands. "Liam!" Her voice was raw with anguish.

"She's your own daughter! How could you be so careless? I know you don't love me. You only came back out of obligation. Isabelle and I won't interfere with your new life. Why do this? You don't deserve to be her father!"

Liam's lips moved soundlessly, his face ashen, his eyes hollow.

Overcome by emotion, Olivia sobbed until she nearly fainted. Sebastian, who had just arrived, quickly pulled her aside and began explaining. The truth was, Liam had been wronged all along.
###Chapter 489

Liam had been ensnared by Eleanor's schemes, convinced everything would resolve itself as long as Sebastian and Oliver were tracking Isabelle. But Liam never imagined the depths of Eleanor's insanity.

Sebastian knelt before Olivia, his face contorted with guilt. He struck himself repeatedly, voice shaking with remorse. "Ms. Sinclair, this is all my fault. I failed to protect your daughter properly. Mr. Blackwood isn't to blame."

As Sebastian recounted the events, his voice broke with sorrow. He and Oliver had chased after Isabelle and quickly found her. While Sebastian managed to calm her, Liam never appeared. That's when Oliver expressed concern that Liam might do something irreversible to Eleanor and urged Sebastian to intervene.

Sebastian knew Oliver well. Though Oliver always followed Eleanor's orders, he wasn't evil. Still, Sebastian agreed to leave. He never expected what would happen just moments after he turned away.

Overcome with guilt, Oliver confessed that Eleanor had ordered him to take Isabelle. The plan was to frighten Olivia for a few days, hoping she'd leave Liam.

But Oliver hadn't anticipated that Eleanor's thugs would immediately overpower him after Sebastian left. Worse still, they pushed Isabelle directly into the path of an oncoming vehicle, putting her life in grave danger.

Olivia felt too numb to cry when she heard this. She lifted her gaze to Liam, who knelt silently outside the operating room.

The usually proud man now hung his head, his strong frame slumped in defeat. His characteristic arrogance had completely shattered.

Olivia had never seen Liam so consumed by despair. Just then, the doctor emerged from surgery.

With grim tones, the doctor explained Isabelle had lost too much blood and urgently needed a transfusion. Liam immediately volunteered. Their blood types matched, but the required amount was substantial.

Liam endured the procedure in stoic silence. When he emerged, his face was ghostly pale. Only when he heard Isabelle was out of danger did a genuine smile finally touch Liam's lips.

"Thank God!" Liam exclaimed, eyes red with relief. He turned abruptly, staggering before collapsing to his knees before Olivia.

Seeing him like this, Olivia couldn't help but pity him. Liam bowed his head, voice trembling. "You're right, Olivia. I don't deserve to be Isabelle's father. If not for me, Eleanor would never have targeted you. I swear I'll stay away from you both."

Tears welled in Olivia's eyes as emotions overwhelmed her. After a long silence, she finally spoke, voice strained. "How do you plan to punish Eleanor? I want her locked away."

Liam remained silent, expression unreadable.

Olivia's lips curled in disdain. "Still protecting her? Clearly your promises meant nothing. Fine. Just remember your vow. From now on, stay away from us—I never want to see you again." She turned sharply but stumbled as she walked away.

Sebastian helped Liam up, sympathy washing over him. "Mr. Blackwood, why not tell Ms. Sinclair the truth? Eleanor's actions stem from battlefield trauma. She's mentally ill—the law won't hold her accountable. It's not that you won't punish her; you can't imprison her."
###Chapter 490

Liam's eyes followed Olivia's retreating figure, his gaze heavy with unspoken devotion. His lips curved into a forced smile that did nothing to conceal the storm raging within him.

"I wasn't planning to let Eleanor escape consequences so easily. But first, I need to get her out of the country. Never underestimate a mother's desperation when her child is involved. I'll handle this myself - Olivia shouldn't have blood on her hands."

Thankfully, Isabelle had stabilized after surgery. The doctors assured them all limbs were intact and with proper rehabilitation, there would be no permanent damage.

Though Isabelle's injuries looked terrifying, they weren't as life-threatening as they appeared. The swift medical intervention had been crucial. Being so young, her body healed remarkably fast.

Yet childhood trauma could leave deeper scars than physical wounds. Olivia remained vigilant about Isabelle's psychological recovery.

For three endless days, Olivia kept vigil at Isabelle's bedside, waiting for her to emerge from post-surgical sedation. During those seventy-two hours, she'd barely managed five hours of sleep total, only collapsing when exhaustion overpowered her.

On the fourth morning, Isabelle finally stirred.

"Mommy..." Her cracked lips formed the word weakly. Olivia's heart shattered seeing her precious daughter entangled in tubes and monitors. The sight tore at her soul.

She knew Liam hadn't left. He came during her rare moments of sleep or lurked just beyond her line of sight. He thought himself invisible, but her senses had become attuned to his presence like a compass to north. She pretended not to notice as long as he maintained his distance.

Evelyn and Beatrice arrived shortly after Isabelle woke. Their faces crumpled at the sight of the fragile child. Olivia stood too quickly, the room spinning as she nearly collapsed.

When Evelyn saw Olivia's haggard appearance, she immediately stepped forward. "Ms. Kensington, you're exhausted. You must rest. Your daughter needs you strong. The competition is starting soon. Don't worry about accompanying me - I can manage alone."

Olivia pressed fingers to her throbbing temples, suddenly feeling every one of her thirty years. The boundless energy of her youth had abandoned her. Days without proper sleep left her visibly drained.

"Margaret will definitely cause trouble," Olivia fretted. "I don't like you facing her alone."

Evelyn gave a confident smile, squeezing Olivia's shoulder. "Don't underestimate me. After everything you've taught me, do you really think I can't handle one petty socialite?"

Seeing Evelyn's determination, Olivia reluctantly agreed. She spent the next twenty minutes drilling last-minute instructions into her protégé before letting her leave.

Amidst the tension, they brought surprising news: Beatrice had successfully infiltrated the nursing home connected to Margaret. Margaret's father had never been particularly paternal, and Margaret herself had only met Beatrice a handful of times in childhood.

With Margaret's memories of Beatrice long faded, the older woman moved through the facility unnoticed. After discreet inquiries, she'd discovered Alistair's whereabouts. He was indeed staying with Margaret, though curiously, not among the regular residents.
###Chapter 491

The discovery wasn't made by Olivia alone. Evelyn Whitmore had also collected damning evidence of abuse occurring within the nursing home. Both Evelyn and Beatrice cared deeply for Isabelle, their concern bringing a rare warmth to Olivia's burdened heart.

The competition began shortly after. Though preoccupied with caring for Isabelle at Mercy Hospital, Olivia remained intensely focused on the unfolding events. Thankfully, the competition was being live-streamed, allowing her to follow every development in real time.

As anticipated, Evelyn dominated the first round, securing top position. Margaret Sinclair, predictably, wasn't pleased with the outcome. But when Evelyn revealed she was Gregory Thornton's protégé, Margaret was rendered speechless, her arguments crumbling.

Evelyn maintained her winning streak, rapidly accumulating points that left Margaret trailing. Olivia sensed Margaret wouldn't accept defeat quietly. True to form, the night Evelyn claimed another victory, Margaret posted a carefully curated photo on social media.

The image, taken from a deliberately unflattering angle, showed Evelyn without her signature makeup. Her usual polished appearance had been so transformed that Margaret hadn't recognized her initially at the competition.

Margaret uploaded the photo with calculated timing, immediately adopting the victim's mantle. "Years ago, this individual stole my creative work for profit, reducing my efforts to nothing. While the Sinclair Enterprises disciplined her, they shielded her from legal consequences. Now this plagiarist resurfaces through this competition, and my suffering is forgotten. Why does injustice prevail?"

Evelyn's plagiarism scandal had indeed caused significant controversy in its time. Within hours, the story gained traction as netizens uncovered Evelyn's dual identity - both Gregory Thornton's student and a designer at Sinclair Enterprises.

As details emerged, public backlash swelled, with fingers pointed at Evelyn and Sinclair Enterprises alike. Most criticism, however, was directed squarely at Olivia.

"Remember how Evelyn struggled these past years? How exactly did she manage to reinvent herself for this comeback?"

"Need I remind you who currently leads Sinclair Enterprises? A Kensington family member. With those connections, rehabilitating someone's reputation is child's play."

"Plagiarism is unforgivable. Why is she being given this platform? We must boycott Olivia and Sinclair Enterprises!"

"Agreed!"

"Creators deserve justice!"

Despite the online vitriol, Olivia remained composed. After allowing the controversy to simmer for precisely one hour, she released the meticulously gathered evidence she'd compiled over recent days.

Her revelation included the bombshell that Evelyn and Margaret were half-sisters. Side-by-side comparisons of their respective works clearly showed who had stolen from whom.

But Olivia had uncovered more damning proof - Margaret's questionable affiliations with various welfare organizations and nursing homes, through which she'd amassed considerable profits.

After posting the incriminating evidence, Olivia exhaled slowly. Yet unease lingered. She'd analyzed the situation carefully - if Evelyn came forward to clarify matters now, people might question why she'd remained silent for so many years.
###Chapter 492

The spotlight burned bright as Olivia Sinclair stepped forward. This was her moment to expose the truth that had been buried for far too long.

Margaret Sinclair never imagined her carefully constructed facade would crumble so spectacularly. The damning evidence Olivia presented had clearly been gathered over months of meticulous investigation. All this time, Olivia had remained silent, allowing Margaret and Sinclair Enterprises to endure relentless public scrutiny.

As the scandal erupted across social media, Margaret's hands turned ice cold. Her legs trembled uncontrollably beneath her designer dress. The welfare institutions that had partnered with her immediately demanded explanations.

But Olivia's first-person footage left no room for denial. The disturbing videos showed the horrific truth behind the institutions' pristine facades. Their leaders now faced criminal charges.

These supposed havens of care had been nothing more than elaborate traps. They lured families with promises of exceptional care, only to subject their vulnerable charges to unspeakable abuse behind closed doors.

When families tried to reclaim their loved ones, the institutions resorted to blackmail. With Margaret's influence protecting them, victims had remained silent - until now.

While Margaret hadn't personally participated in the abuse, her complicity was undeniable. Her reputation lay in tatters.

Panicked messages flooded Margaret's phone from the institution directors. "Fix this immediately or we'll drag you down with us," one threatened. "Remember all the money you took? Those weren't donations - they were payoffs."

Another added, "You designed half those 'disciplinary procedures' yourself. Should we release those emails?"

Margaret's reply dripped with venom. "You incompetent fools! How could you let someone infiltrate your facilities unnoticed?"

The nursing home director responded with a chilling photo. "Recognize her? This is your own grandmother you sent to us. Your family, and you didn't even know her face."

Margaret's breath caught. She stared at the image of the dignified elderly woman, her fingers shaking violently. This was Beatrice Whitmore? The frail, impoverished woman she'd dismissed years ago?

When her people had found Beatrice wandering the streets, Margaret had assumed she was some senile socialite. She never imagined Olivia could orchestrate such an elaborate sting.

Fury burned through Margaret as she hurled her phone across the room. In that moment, Eleanor Blackwood's offer came rushing back. She'd dismissed the woman as another lovesick fool chasing after Liam.

But with Liam refusing to help and her world collapsing, Margaret realized rejecting Eleanor might have been a mistake. After a moment's hesitation, she picked up her shattered phone and dialed.

###Chapter 493

The internet storm targeting Margaret Sinclair had gradually quieted down. Margaret had maintained complete silence these past few days. The evidence against her was simply too damning—any attempt at defense would only make her look more pathetic.

Margaret's once-devoted followers, who had passionately defended her and attacked anyone who questioned her, now looked like complete fools. The cruelest irony? Her harshest critics now were the very people who used to worship her.

Someone had even managed to track down Margaret's home address, only to find she'd already vacated the premises. Amidst the chaos, Evelyn Whitmore seized the opportunity to clear her name, bringing newfound prestige to Sinclair Enterprises. Even Olivia became a subject of public fascination.

When Evelyn and Beatrice first heard the news, they embraced each other, tears of relief streaming down their faces. After enduring such torment, they were finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.

Yet Olivia couldn't shake an uneasy feeling as she observed Margaret's unnatural silence. She sensed Margaret wouldn't surrender so easily. Olivia's instincts proved correct. When she spotted Margaret disguised as a nurse beside Isabelle, her heart stopped. Her mind went blank, limbs turning to jelly.

Margaret had lost all traces of her former vibrancy. Her once-youthful, charming face now appeared haggard and aged, bearing clear marks of hardship.

She looked like someone who'd been suffering in isolation. Despite everything, when Margaret saw Olivia, she actually smiled. But that smile, plastered across her pale face, twisted into something almost demonic.

Olivia quickly regained her composure, locking eyes with Margaret. "Take whatever you want—even my life—but spare my child." Little Isabelle seemed to grasp the gravity of the situation. Though so young, fear flickered in her wide eyes as she bit her lip hard, fighting back tears.

Margaret clutched a syringe in one hand and Isabelle's IV tube in the other, her gaze icy. "Olivia, no matter how powerful you are, your vulnerabilities ensure you'll never be truly invincible."

"What do you want?" Olivia barely dared to breathe in that tense moment.

"Money? Or perhaps I can give you a new identity, help you disappear somewhere no one knows you—let you live out your days in peace. You know what I'm capable of. Name your price, and I'll deliver," Olivia attempted to negotiate.

Margaret wavered momentarily before snapping back to reality. Olivia had humiliated her so thoroughly by exposing everything to the public. How could she possibly forgive her? Following Eleanor's plan offered her best shot at revenge.

With that thought, Margaret sneered, "Fine, I'll tell you what I want. Let's see if you can actually deliver." Without hesitation, Olivia nodded. "I want Liam," Margaret demanded. "Get him here. Now."

"Alright, I'll call him." Olivia pulled out her phone and dialed Liam's number. He answered before the first ring completed. Before Olivia could speak, his calm voice cut through: "Don't worry. I'm already on my way—five minutes from the hospital."

That simple, steady reassurance nearly brought Olivia to tears. Liam had been watching over them this entire time.

The moment she'd spotted Margaret, Liam's men must have alerted him immediately. And he'd clearly dropped everything to race to the hospital. Olivia had to admit—sometimes, Liam could be surprisingly dependable.
###Chapter 494

"I'll be waiting," Olivia whispered, her voice shaking despite her best efforts to remain composed. The moment she ended the call, Liam's determination was almost tangible through the phone line. She could practically hear the engine roar as he pressed the accelerator harder.

True to his word, Liam arrived in under five minutes. The mask he usually wore was gone, revealing his striking features - slightly weary but undeniably handsome. His normally concealed skin appeared paler than usual, making his sharp, icy eyes stand out even more. He radiated an aura of danger and dark intensity, like a storm given human form.

The moment Liam entered, his hand found Olivia's, gripping it firmly before turning his steel-gray gaze toward Margaret. "I'm here. What's your next move?"

Margaret seemed momentarily stunned by Liam's unveiled appearance. Her voice trembled with wounded vulnerability. "Just answer me one thing. That night you saved me, let me stay at your place... Was there really nothing between us? I know you felt something!"

Liam's expression twisted in disgust at her absurd question, his eyes flashing with cold contempt.

"I only helped you because you claimed to have connections. I needed help finding Isabelle's grandfather." His voice turned icy. "Then I discovered your involvement with Olivia. She was furious with me back then, wouldn't even speak to me. I thought you might be useful, but clearly, I overestimated you."

Margaret's face paled. She'd never imagined Liam's interest in her was solely because of Olivia. Her voice rose to a shrill pitch.

"Look at her, Liam! She doesn't care about you at all! She knew it was dangerous for you to come, yet she let you! What if I wanted you dead? She'd sacrifice you for her daughter without hesitation!"

Olivia felt her stomach twist with conflicting emotions. She wasn't sure what choice she would have made if Margaret had demanded Liam's life. But before she could dwell on it, Liam's voice cut through her thoughts.

"I don't need her to choose. I owe them both. Even if she hadn't asked, I'd give my life willingly. There's nothing I wouldn't do for them."

His words were absolute, spoken with the calm certainty of stating an undeniable truth.

Unbeknownst to them, Margaret wore a hidden microphone. On the other end, Eleanor Blackwood listened to every word.

Seizing the moment, Liam moved to Olivia's side. Eleanor had already left for the airport, watching the cityscape blur past her car window. Liam's declaration echoed in her mind, underscoring just how important Olivia was to him.

The pain in her chest intensified with each passing second. Did Liam truly love Olivia that much? Enough to throw away everything, even his life?

Eleanor's fists clenched, her dark eyes swirling with turbulent emotions - heartbreak warring with something far more dangerous. Margaret's pulse raced as she saw the deadly resolve in Liam's eyes. Fear gripped her, but all she could do was silently pray Eleanor had escaped already.

Before Margaret could react, Liam lunged forward, grabbing her wrist. She shrieked, instinctively swinging the needle she held toward him.

With lightning reflexes, Liam dodged and pinned her to the ground with brutal efficiency. His security team swarmed in instantly, restraining Margaret effortlessly.

Olivia rushed to Isabelle, her hands trembling as she knelt beside her daughter. Tears welled in her eyes. "Mummy..." Isabelle's small voice quivered with fear as she sobbed uncontrollably. Gently, Liam wiped the tears from both Olivia and Isabelle's faces, his touch surprisingly tender.
###Chapter 495

Liam's expression turned to stone as he pivoted to fix Olivia with an icy glare that could freeze hell itself. The intensity of his stare made Olivia instinctively recoil, yet defiance still burned in her eyes. She clutched her secret weapon tightly - surrender wasn't an option.

The towering figure of Liam loomed over Olivia, his voice dropping to a lethal whisper. "Pick your poison."

Olivia's lips twisted into a grotesque smirk. "You won't kill me," she taunted, false bravado dripping from every word. "You don't have the stomach for it."

The door burst open as Sebastian rushed in, breath ragged. "Sir, Eleanor has escaped."

Natalie, who'd been comforting Isabelle, froze mid-motion. Turning slowly, she caught the flash of victory in Olivia's eyes. The puzzle pieces suddenly clicked - Olivia and Eleanor had been working together all along. That explained how Olivia knew Liam's true identity.

Olivia's smirk widened into something grotesquely self-satisfied. Liam studied her with cold amusement before letting out a derisive chuckle. "You actually think she's coming back for you?"

The smirk faltered. "What are you talking about?" Olivia's voice held the slightest tremor.

Sebastian stepped forward with clinical precision. "By the time we received the alert, Miss Blackwood had already boarded a private jet to Montecarlo. She'll be landing within hours."

All color drained from Olivia's face. "That's impossible," she whispered, panic cracking her voice. "We had a deal! She wouldn't... She couldn't just abandon me like this! What about her reputation?"

Sebastian delivered the killing blow with detached calm. "Miss Blackwood hasn't been a war correspondent in years. After that incident in the conflict zone... Let's just say reputation means nothing to someone who's already lost their mind."

Olivia collapsed to her knees, trembling with rage and disbelief. Natalie, now composed, turned Sebastian's words over in her mind. She'd never imagined Eleanor suffered from mental illness.

Suddenly Liam's refusal to promise prison for Eleanor that day made sense. And according to Sebastian, Liam had been controlling Eleanor all along. Was this his own twisted form of punishment?

Natalie's thoughts spiraled until she barely noticed when Liam's security team escorted the broken Olivia away. The hospital room fell into heavy silence, leaving only the three of them. Liam stood motionless beside Natalie, waiting with unnatural patience.

Little Isabelle, sensing the tension, glanced between her mother and Liam before piping up in a small voice. "Mommy... I'm scared. Can Liam stay with me?" The fear in her sweet voice tugged at Natalie's heartstrings.

Natalie snapped back to reality, her automatic refusal dying on her lips. After today's chaos... She exhaled softly. "Alright, darling. If Liam is willing."

Liam knelt beside Isabelle's bed, gently smoothing her hair. "The nurses told me how brave you've been. No crying during shots or medicine. That's very impressive."

Isabelle managed a weak smile. "I didn't want Mommy to worry more."

The lump in Natalie's throat threatened to choke her. She stood abruptly. "You two talk. I need some air."

As Natalie fled, Isabelle urgently whispered to Liam, "Go after her!" Liam chuckled at the girl's determined expression, seeing so much of young Natalie in her face.
###Chapter 496

Olivia reached the stairwell, letting the heavy door click shut behind her. The dim emergency lights cast eerie green shadows across the concrete walls. She leaned against the cold railing, letting the darkness envelop her as she tried to steady her breathing.

Footsteps echoed suddenly from below. Her body tensed instinctively as she spun around, fists raised defensively. But strong fingers closed around her wrist before she could strike. "If I'd been half a second slower, you would've broken my nose," a familiar voice teased.

The fight drained from Olivia's posture, though irritation still flickered in her eyes. "Sneaking up on people in dark stairwells isn't exactly smart, Liam. Can you blame me for reacting?"

Liam released her wrist and stepped back, studying her face with unusual intensity. "Still mad at me?" he asked quietly.

Olivia hesitated. The harsh words she'd thrown at him earlier now felt like ash in her mouth. After witnessing how fiercely he'd protected Isabelle today, her emotions had become a tangled mess.

She nibbled her lower lip before answering. "Being angry seems pointless now. You saved Isabelle today, and for that... I'm grateful."

A deep chuckle rumbled from Liam's chest, warm and knowing. "As long as you're not holding grudges," he murmured, his gaze locking onto hers. "If you ever need anything - anything at all - just say the word. No pressure, no strings."

Olivia shook her head, conflicted. "That's not fair to you. I can't just take advantage of your kindness."

Liam's expression turned solemn. "Olivia, I owe you. There's nothing I wouldn't do for you." The raw sincerity in his voice made her pulse stutter.

She turned away, unable to meet his intense gaze as doubts swirled through her mind. Had he made these same promises to others? Was this just another empty vow?

To her horror, the thought slipped past her lips before she could stop it. Liam moved instantly, closing the distance between them. "Never," he said fiercely. "These words are only for you. Not for Jack who saved my business, not for anyone else. I've been an arrogant fool, Olivia. I've made mistakes, but this promise? This is only for you. Don't believe me? I swear on—"

Olivia coughed loudly, cutting him off. "Alright, enough dramatics. You should get back to Isabelle. She must be terrified alone in that hospital room."

She shot him a wry look, amusement coloring her tone. "And stop saying such embarrassing things. If Isabelle hears you, she'll never let us live it down."

The tension melted from Liam's shoulders as her teasing registered. His smile broke wide and genuine, brighter than she'd ever seen. His eyes sparkled with unrestrained joy. "Message received. But tell me, sweetheart, what would you like to eat? I'll have it delivered immediately."

Olivia scowled. "Don't call me that."

But Liam, pretending not to hear, kept pace with her as they exited the stairwell, peppering her with "sweetheart" at every opportunity. When they passed Sebastian in the hallway, the assistant couldn't hide his astonishment at seeing his usually reserved boss so openly delighted.

Time passed swiftly, and Isabelle made a remarkable recovery. Meanwhile, Sinclair Enterprises' reputation flourished, with customers clamoring for their innovative products.
###Chapter 497

At first, Alexander Montgomery had been reluctant about the collaboration. But witnessing Sinclair Enterprises' meteoric rise in popularity, he quickly reversed his stance and approached Olivia Sinclair for an alliance. Recognizing this as the most honorable path forward, he even lowered his pricing as a goodwill gesture.

To his surprise, Olivia accepted his proposal without the slightest resentment, as though his initial hesitation had never occurred. She embraced the partnership wholeheartedly, directing her team to issue a series of meticulously crafted press releases.

These statements wove a compelling narrative—during Sinclair Enterprises' darkest years, it was Montgomery Holdings that had silently sustained them, supplying goods at below-market rates to ensure their survival.

The story spread like wildfire, evolving into a legendary tale of two prestigious corporations standing together through adversity. Naturally, a few cynics whispered that Montgomery Holdings was merely capitalizing on Sinclair Enterprises' newfound success.

What they didn’t realize was that this was all part of Olivia’s masterstroke—subtly intertwining the legacies of both companies. In truth, Montgomery Holdings’ achievements far eclipsed Sinclair Enterprises’, and this strategic alliance benefited them both.

Alexander wasn’t fooled. He knew exactly what Olivia was orchestrating. Over the phone, he chuckled. "Miss Kensington, you’re a brilliant tactician. I’ve always prided myself on being sharp, but I didn’t expect to be outmaneuvered by you—just slightly."

Olivia, never one for false modesty, replied bluntly, "Well, I did spend $3,000 on an executive strategy course. It’d be a waste not to put it to good use."

Alexander admired her candor. It was one of the things he respected most about her—her refusal to downplay her own brilliance. "There’s an event the day after tomorrow," he said. "Halstead’s top entrepreneurs will be there. Perfect for expanding your network. Will you come?"

It was exactly the opportunity Olivia had been waiting for. She accepted without hesitation. Alexander gave her only an address, withholding further details, but Olivia was never one to rely on others for information. She conducted her own research.

The venue turned out to be an exclusive estate—a playground for the elite, where the wealthy gathered for horseback riding, golf, and even private hunting expeditions on the sprawling hills. This wasn’t just a party; it was a display of power and privilege.

On the day of the event, Olivia selected her attire with precision. She chose an ensemble that balanced elegance with practicality—sophisticated enough for high society yet functional for the activities. Her long hair was swept into a sleek ponytail, with a few loose strands framing her face, lending her an effortlessly polished aura.

When she arrived, Alexander was already at the entrance, waiting with a relaxed smile. The moment his gaze landed on Olivia, he was momentarily stunned.

Olivia had become a formidable force in Halstead’s business world—known for her sharp instincts, decisive leadership, and unshakable vision.

People often forgot that beneath that commanding presence was a striking beauty. Even with minimal makeup, her natural elegance was undeniable. Her face, softened by the delicate strands of hair that escaped her ponytail, carried quiet strength. Her once-gentle eyes now held a cool, calculating edge, hardened by the trials she had endured.

Alexander felt a fleeting warmth in his chest but quickly refocused. "How’s your daughter?" he asked, his tone genuine. News of Isabelle’s accident had spread quickly—especially with so many witnesses at the school gates that day. It was no surprise Alexander had heard.

Olivia’s expression softened, a rare warmth breaking through. "She’s recovering well. Already begging to go outside and play. The doctors say she’ll be discharged soon. Thank you for asking."

###Chapter 498

The afternoon sun cast golden streaks across the manicured lawns as Olivia and Alexander strolled side by side. Their conversation had shifted from business matters to lighter topics, the tension between them dissolving into an easy camaraderie.

Alexander, his mood noticeably brighter, casually mentioned the new stallion he'd imported from Eldermere. "You should see him," he said, eyes gleaming with enthusiasm. "A magnificent creature. Would you care to join me for a ride?"

Olivia suppressed a relieved smile. While she wasn't an expert equestrian, she could hold her own. As they turned toward the stables, their banter was effortless, the kind that came from mutual understanding.

Then, a sound cut through their laughter—soft, muffled sobs.

They stopped mid-step, exchanging glances before scanning their surroundings. Their gazes landed on a young woman in an emerald-green dress, crouched near a wrought-iron bench. Her shoulders trembled, her face buried in her hands.

She was a picture of devastation. Her dark hair tumbled in disarray over her shoulders, her delicate frame shaking with each quiet cry. Tears streaked her flushed cheeks, her red-rimmed eyes brimming with despair. The way she bit her lip only accentuated her fragility.

Olivia assessed the scene quickly. The girl was clearly out of place—likely a guest who had stumbled into this elite gathering unprepared. One of her shoes was missing, her stocking torn, adding to her disheveled appearance.

Her first instinct was to walk away. This wasn't her problem. She could alert a staff member, have them discreetly handle the situation—perhaps find the girl a change of clothes and send her home.

But Alexander, standing beside her, frowned. "It wouldn't be proper for me to approach her," he murmured. "Would you mind checking if she needs assistance?"

Olivia hesitated, her usual detachment surfacing. But before she could refuse, the girl lifted her head—and their eyes met.

There was something raw in that gaze. A vulnerability that tugged at Olivia's instincts, stirring an unexpected protectiveness.

With a quiet sigh, she turned to Alexander. "Does she look familiar to you?"

He shook his head. "No, never seen her before."

Understanding, Olivia stepped forward. She helped the girl to her feet, brushing dirt from her dress with deliberate gentleness.

Before the girl could speak, Olivia kept her voice low but firm. "There are spare clothes available, though they may not fit perfectly. My advice? Change and rejoin the event, or find a quiet lounge to wait it out."

The girl's tear-streaked face hardened with resolve. "You see right through me, don't you?" she whispered. "I'm not here just for the party. I came for opportunities. Sitting in a lounge won't get me anywhere. I can't waste this chance."

Olivia studied her for a long moment. There was fire beneath the tears—a determination she recognized.

After a pause, she gave the girl's shoulder a reassuring squeeze. "You're right," she conceded. "Come with me. I'll take you to the staff."

Gratitude flickered in the girl's eyes. "Thank you."

As she turned to leave, her gaze lingered on Alexander—just for a heartbeat—with something unreadable in her expression.

Curiosity.

Hope.

Something more.

Olivia noted it but said nothing.

The afternoon carried on, the encounter already fading into the background.

But some moments, however small, had a way of lingering.
###Chapter 499

Olivia watched as the young woman vanished into the dressing room before continuing her path toward the racetrack. When she arrived, Alexander was already astride his newly acquired stallion, his face alight with pure delight. Spotting Olivia, he immediately dismounted and strode toward her.

"Olivia, you must try him!" Alexander's dimples deepened with his enthusiastic grin. The usually sharp businessman seemed transformed - his youthful energy making him appear years younger.

She pressed her lips together, deliberately stepping back to widen the space between them. "I'd rather not. While I can ride, I wouldn't want to risk injuring your prized possession."

The brief shadow that crossed Alexander's eyes betrayed his disappointment, but he wasn't ready to concede. His voice softened as he tried again. "He's just a horse, Olivia. Quite gentle actually. If you're nervous, we could ride together."

A playful smirk tugged at his lips. "No more excuses. I specifically asked if you wanted to ride before we came."

Olivia found herself speechless. She hadn't anticipated Alexander's obvious infatuation. This wasn't something she'd sought, yet here they stood.

She understood the unspoken rules of their world all too well. Men like Alexander didn't choose partners based on mere attraction. They sought someone who could complement their lifestyle, elevate their status, and prove advantageous in countless ways. She fit that mold perfectly, and it sickened her.

As Alexander's hopeful gaze met hers and the crowd's teasing cheers surrounded them, Olivia felt a wave of discomfort. Her frown deepened, feeling trapped by societal expectations. With a quiet sigh, she reluctantly reached for the reins, her fingers tightening around the leather as she prepared to mount.

Just as Olivia began to swing herself up, thunderous hooves shattered the moment. A dark blur - like a midnight storm - rushed past with startling speed.

The previously calm horse beside Olivia reared violently, breaking free from her grip before galloping wildly across the field. Quick-acting staff managed to corral the frightened animal before any harm was done.

Both Olivia and Alexander turned toward the disturbance. To their shock, it wasn't some natural phenomenon but Liam, riding a magnificent black stallion that dwarfed Alexander's prized purchase.

The powerful black beast was breathtaking - muscles rippling beneath its glossy coat. No wonder Alexander's horse had panicked.

Alexander's expression darkened, though his breeding prevented any outburst. He gestured sharply to staff. "What are you standing there for? Escort this gentleman out."

A staff member leaned in to whisper urgently. Alexander's face shifted from anger to reluctant acceptance. He forced a tight smile as Liam approached still mounted. "Mr. Blackwood. My apologies for not recognizing you earlier."

Though the most influential person present, Alexander hadn't organized this event - hence his unawareness of Liam's attendance. Liam dismounted smoothly, gave Alexander the barest nod, and walked past him without another word.

Alexander's outstretched hand hung awkwardly in midair before dropping to his side. His expression turned glacial.
###Chapter 500

The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the equestrian grounds as Olivia Sinclair adjusted her riding gloves. Though everyone knew Liam Blackwood was a powerful man, Alexander Montgomery saw no reason to show him courtesy when he approached with such arrogant strides. Alexander moved instinctively to shield Olivia, fearing she might be trapped in an awkward situation.

To his astonishment, Liam stepped directly in front of Olivia, his masked face tilting slightly. "Did I startle you?" His voice carried an unexpected gentleness that made Alexander's protective instincts flare.

Though the mask concealed Liam's expression, the tension in his posture and the careful modulation of his voice betrayed his feelings. Alexander's initial shock quickly turned to alarm.

Olivia understood Liam's game immediately. Annoyance warred with reluctant amusement as she snapped, "Mr. Blackwood, must you ask such obvious questions? Of course you frightened me."

Gasps rippled through the spectators. No one had ever dared speak to the infamous Mr. Blackwood with such impertinence. Yet instead of anger, his response was almost... tender.

"I noticed your discomfort earlier," Liam murmured, ignoring the audience. "That docile pony you were riding isn't worthy of you. Try my stallion instead." He gestured to the magnificent black thoroughbred pawing the ground behind him.

Despite her irritation, Olivia couldn't help admiring the powerful animal. As she hesitated, Alexander stepped forward with a diplomat's smile.

"Mr. Blackwood, Miss Sinclair isn't an experienced rider. Such a spirited mount might prove too challenging."

The subtle barb in Alexander's words wasn't lost on anyone. Liam's eyes crinkled with amusement behind his mask.

"Precisely why she should try. What's the fun in conquering creatures already broken to saddle?" He turned to Olivia with a conspiratorial wink. "Your choice - ride with me, or stay with him."

Olivia clenched her jaw. Liam had an uncanny ability to back her into corners.

Alexander moved closer, his whisper urgent. "I don't know how you know him, but he's dangerous. He clearly has—"

Liam didn't let him finish. With one smooth motion, he swept Olivia away. The usually composed Alexander flushed with rare anger, yet could do nothing - he and Olivia were merely friends after all.

Throwing Alexander an apologetic glance, Olivia found herself lifted effortlessly onto the massive stallion. Her irritation flared anew as the restless animal shifted beneath her.

Then warm arms encircled her, that familiar cedar-and-spice scent enveloping her senses. Against her will, some of the tension left her shoulders.

"You promised not to embarrass me," she hissed over her shoulder. "Breaking your word already?"

Liam's chuckle vibrated against her back. "On the contrary, darling. I'm keeping my hospital promise by checking on you. I wouldn't have intervened if Montgomery hadn't been pressuring you."

Olivia pursed her lips. "I'm not interested in Alexander. Don't flatter yourself. Men like him are too absorbed in their jeweled world to understand romance."

The stallion shifted impatiently as Liam tightened his grip on the reins, his breath warm against Olivia's ear. "Then prove it," he challenged. "Let's show them what real riding looks like."

Before she could protest, Liam urged the stallion forward, leaving Alexander staring after them, his hands clenched into fists at his sides. The spectators' murmurs faded behind them as horse and riders disappeared down the wooded trail, swallowed by the golden afternoon light.
###Chapter 501

Liam contemplated for a moment. "He's being foolish. Regardless, the true villain here is him, and you're just caught between them. You won't upset Alexander. Don't worry about it."

Olivia's heart warmed slightly at his words, but she pouted, "I don't need your help to handle myself."

Liam didn't respond. Instead, with a subtle nudge of his heels, the horse suddenly surged forward. The abrupt movement made Olivia gasp, her face draining of color. She instinctively wanted to turn and bury herself in Liam's chest.

Sensing her distress, Liam didn't slow their pace but gently covered her white-knuckled grip on the reins with his own hand. He leaned close, his breath warm against her ear. "Breathe. Straighten your posture. Hold the reins firmly. There's nothing to fear."

Guided by Liam's steady voice, Olivia's panic gradually subsided. She began to relish the wind rushing past her face and the rich scent of freshly turned earth from the racecourse, her spirits lifting. From a distance, Alexander watched Olivia's radiant smile beside Liam, his expression darkening.

His assistant, noticing Alexander's distraction, whispered discreetly, "It appears Mr. Blackwood has taken a liking to Miss Sinclair, but there's little we can do about that."

"Even though Miss Sinclair is extraordinary, she's not the only remarkable woman in the world. You're searching for a life partner. With your status and abilities, you'll undoubtedly find someone suitable."

Alexander clenched his fists, his chest tight. "What if I told you my interest in Olivia isn't just about marriage convenience? I'm genuinely drawn to her. That's why I can't let Mr. Blackwood have her."

After their ride, Olivia was surprised to find Alexander still waiting. He insisted on showing her around the estate grounds, with Liam following silently behind them, uninvited.

Alexander's patience wore thin, and he shot an irritated glance over his shoulder. "Mr. Blackwood, do you have other business here?"

Liam flashed a roguish grin. "That's an odd question. Whatever plans you have with Miss Sinclair, I intend to share them. Great minds think alike."

Alexander's face paled with annoyance, his lips moving silently in curses.

The afternoon passed quickly, and soon the evening banquet approached. Fortunately, Olivia had brought an extra outfit for the occasion.

Typically, such events required escorts. Alexander had assumed Olivia would accompany him, but Liam remained stubbornly present.

Before Alexander could speak, Liam smoothly took Olivia's hand, his charming smile dazzling the onlookers. His voice, rich and compelling, carried through the gathering. "Miss Sinclair, would you honor me as your escort tonight? Unlike Alexander here, surrounded by friends who could easily replace you, I came alone."

Olivia's lips twitched with suppressed amusement. The rivalry between them was intense, and she'd never seen this playful side of Liam before. Alexander, refusing to concede, said, "Let's allow Olivia to decide."

Still holding her hand, Liam narrowed his eyes at Alexander with an intimidating gaze. "Do you really think she'd dare refuse me?"

Caught between them, Olivia frowned and shook her head apologetically at Alexander, her cheeks flushed. "I'm sorry, Alexander, but I must consider my situation. As a single mother, I can't afford to make powerful enemies."
###Chapter 502

Alexander Montgomery unclenched his fists with deliberate control. As he watched Olivia Sinclair and Liam Blackwood walk away, he issued a sharp command to his security team. "From now on, Mr. Jack is banned from every high-society event where I might encounter him."

The moment they turned the corner, Olivia pulled her hand from Liam's grasp. "You're enjoying this while I'm the one being called every name in the book," Liam muttered, his jaw tight with irritation.

Olivia's lips curved in a faint, knowing smile. "Isn't this exactly what you wanted? Though I could always return to Alexander if this becomes too troublesome."

Liam's expression shifted instantly, his voice softening as he reached for her. "You know I didn't mean it like that."

Olivia understood his meaning perfectly. She chose not to press the issue, instead glancing around the grand hall. Suddenly, a blur of movement caught her attention.

A woman in mismatched athletic wear came barreling toward them with startling speed. Olivia barely had time to react before they nearly collided.

Stumbling backward, Olivia felt Liam's steadying grip on her elbow. The stranger wasn't so fortunate - she tumbled to the marble floor with an undignified thud, drawing gasps from nearby guests. As Olivia regained her balance, she studied the woman's face, struck by a strange sense of recognition.

Despite the inappropriate attire, the woman was undeniably beautiful. Now sitting on the floor, she began weeping dramatically, her shoulders shaking with exaggerated sobs.

Recognition dawned on Olivia. This was the same woman who'd appeared at the racetrack that morning in an evening gown. Olivia's expression darkened. She'd initially pitied the woman's naivety, but this stunt reeked of calculated manipulation.

Noticing Olivia's reaction, Liam leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. "Do you know her?"

Olivia pressed her lips together and shook her head. "Let's go. I have no interest in this spectacle."

They'd barely taken a step when the woman grabbed Olivia's ankle with surprising strength. "You can't just walk away!" she wailed. "You owe me an explanation!"

Olivia's eyebrows shot up. "Excuse me? What exactly am I supposed to explain?"

The woman's tears flowed freely now, her voice trembling with accusation. "You told me to wear this! Now they're throwing me out! What did I ever do to you?"

A disbelieving laugh escaped Olivia's lips. The audacity was almost impressive.

"Do you dress without considering the occasion?" Olivia countered coolly. "I merely suggested your evening gown was inappropriate for daytime at the races. I certainly didn't tell you to show up at a black-tie gala in gym clothes. Don't you understand basic social etiquette?"

She continued, her voice laced with icy precision, "When I gave you advice this morning, it was out of kindness. Yet you accuse me of sabotaging you? Tell me - what possible motive would I have?"

The woman's tear-filled eyes widened further, her lower lip trembling.

Liam's voice cut through the tension like a blade. "Olivia, you're being far too generous." His gaze swept over the sniffling woman with undisguised contempt. "Security! Remove this nuisance immediately."

The crowd murmured as uniformed guards approached. Olivia straightened her gown, her expression unreadable. This little drama wasn't over - she could feel it in her bones.
###Chapter 503

Olivia wrenched her arm free from the woman's desperate grasp, exhaling sharply through clenched teeth. "If you harass me again or spread baseless accusations, I won't hesitate to call the authorities. Understood?"

Without waiting for a response, Olivia spun around and strode away with Liam. Security swiftly removed the sobbing woman from the premises, though curious stares followed Olivia's retreating figure.

Moments later, an elderly man came rushing through the crowd. His knees buckled upon learning his granddaughter had been forcibly ejected.

Muffled whispers revealed their tragic circumstances - they'd relied on each other through countless hardships. The young woman had come seeking medical funds, only to be publicly humiliated instead.

Their pitiful wails echoed through the lobby, but Olivia remained unmoved. In her view, this was entirely the woman's own doing. Not only had she refused to take responsibility, but she'd tried shifting blame onto others.

The unpleasant encounter darkened Olivia's mood. Within thirty minutes, she fabricated an excuse to depart.

Liam offered to drive her home, but she politely declined. He stood motionless in the crisp night air, watching her taillights disappear around the corner. When he turned, Alexander's icy glare met him from across the pavement.

Liam didn't flinch. Instead, his lips curled into a mocking smile. "Mr. Montgomery, to what do I owe this pleasure?"

Alexander cleared his throat, his deceptively soft tone laced with warning. "Mr. Blackwood, while your intentions remain unclear, I'd advise against toying with Miss Sinclair if you lack serious intentions. She's an accomplished woman who won't settle for being some playboy's trophy."

Liam's smirk vanished instantly. "Who said anything about making her a trophy? You're projecting your own insecurities."

"Hardly," Alexander countered swiftly. "My interest stems from genuine admiration. She deserves stability, a reliable partner, and familial support - all of which I can provide. You'd only bring her chaos."

Liam slid his hands into his pockets, his expression turning glacial. "You claim to understand her, yet you're completely mistaken. She doesn't need anyone's protection."

Alexander's eyes narrowed. "How would you know what she needs? You barely know her."

A dangerous glint appeared in Liam's eyes as he tilted his head. "Actually, I know her far better than you do. Feel free to ask Olivia if you doubt me."

Color flooded Alexander's face, rendering him momentarily speechless. When he finally found his voice, it came out strained. "Can you honestly say you care for her? With your notorious reputation and her being a single mother? This is clearly just another game to you."

Liam's gaze turned arctic. "You're not defending her honor - you're insulting her with these assumptions. If her child bothers you so much, why pretend to be noble?"

Alexander's expression twisted uncomfortably. "Any reasonable man would have concerns. But I've decided to embrace both Olivia and her daughter as my own."

Having heard enough, Liam brushed past him with a dismissive wave. "Spare us the theatrics. She won't end up with me, but you stand no chance either. What she values is authenticity."

As Liam walked away, Alexander's face darkened considerably. "And what makes you so certain my feelings aren't authentic?" he called after him.

The night swallowed Liam's retreating figure without response.
###Chapter 504

The morning sun streamed through the hospital windows as Isabelle prepared for her discharge. Olivia arrived at Mercy Hospital before visiting hours, only to find two unexpected figures waiting outside the pediatric ward - Liam and Alexander.

Both men stood several feet apart, their gazes locked on the little girl while pointedly ignoring each other. The tension between them crackled like static electricity. Olivia understood Liam's presence - he had every right to be there. But Alexander Montgomery's appearance raised questions.

Approaching with a cautious expression, Olivia addressed the jewelry heir. "I didn't expect to see you here. Thank you for visiting my daughter."

Alexander reached out to tuck a stray curl behind Isabelle's ear, his smile warm. "We've met before, and she completely won me over. I couldn't resist seeing her again."

Isabelle beamed up at her mother. "Mommy, Alexander is so nice!"

Olivia's breath caught. "Do you... like Alexander?"

Before the child could answer, Liam scooped her up possessively, putting distance between them. Alexander's smile faltered for just a second before he recovered.

Liam pretended to pout. "Isabelle, didn't you promise you'd only say that about me?"

The little girl considered this seriously before amending, "Okay, then Alexander is second best. First place is only for you." The declaration made Alexander's jaw tighten as he glared at Liam.

"You shouldn't manipulate a child," Alexander snapped.

"Did you actually see any manipulation?" Liam shot back.

As their argument escalated, Olivia stepped between them protectively. Alexander turned to her with a charming smile. "Olivia, I've arranged a small celebration for Isabelle's discharge. Let's make it special."

Olivia offered a polite but distant smile. "That's kind, but unnecessary. The doctors recommended rest. We'll be going straight home."

Liam deliberately shouldered past Alexander. "I'll drive you," he stated bluntly.

Olivia ignored him completely, gathering Isabelle in her arms and walking away. Alexander seized the moment to taunt, "Seems she doesn't want anything to do with you."

Liam remained unruffled. "At least she hasn't made any promises to you either."

"You—" Alexander stormed off, his expensive shoes clicking angrily against the linoleum.

Liam's expression darkened. Sebastian leaned in to whisper, "Sinclair Enterprises still has that partnership with Montgomery Jewelers. If you punch him, Olivia might—"

"I know," Liam cut him off, exhaling sharply. "Here I am, her actual father, getting shown up by some pretty boy with a trust fund. Never thought I'd see the day."

Sebastian wisely swallowed his initial response. "You kind of brought this on yourself," he muttered under his breath.
###Chapter 505

Liam chuckled softly, shaking his head. "As long as they're happy, nothing else matters, right?"

Sebastian rubbed his temples, feeling a headache coming on. He never realized Liam could be such an incurable romantic.

Meanwhile, the turmoil surrounding Sinclair Enterprises was finally settling down. In a surprising move, Liam had the company transfer documents delivered directly to Olivia.

Olivia didn't hesitate for a second. She'd already agreed to this arrangement beforehand. Handing over tens of millions to Liam, she knew him too well. Liam simply accepted the money without comment.

Sinclair Enterprises continued operating under its usual management, though Olivia had implemented several new policies.

When the day arrived for Olivia to leave Halstead with Isabelle, Evelyn and Beatrice came to the airport to see them off. Evelyn, usually so composed, found herself unexpectedly emotional.

Olivia gave her a helpless smile. "Don't cry. I'll be back before you know it," she reassured them.

Beatrice, wiping her own tears, suddenly pulled Evelyn into a deep bow before Olivia. Flustered, Olivia quickly raised them both up. "You're making this harder than it needs to be."

Evelyn dabbed at her eyes, her voice trembling yet firm. "Miss Kensington, if you ever need anything in the future, just say the word. Even if it costs me my life, I'll do it for you. If you don't tell me when you're in trouble, I'll take it as you not trusting me. We owe you that much."

Olivia didn't argue. Just then, the boarding announcement echoed through the terminal.

Once settled in their seats, Olivia noticed someone sitting nearby. A quick glance made her heart skip a beat - it was Liam, unmasked, his striking features fully visible.

Olivia was stunned speechless. Clearing her throat, she whispered, "What are you doing here? Aren't you worried about being recognized?"

Liam's eyes sparkled with mischief. "No need to worry. I booked out the entire first-class cabin."

Olivia frowned slightly. "Shouldn't Alexander be sitting here? Why is it you?"

Alexander had mentioned a business exchange in Crestwood just days before. Since Olivia was returning there, they'd planned to travel together. Having no reason to refuse, Olivia had sent Alexander her flight details, and he'd secured the seat beside hers. Liam simply smiled knowingly, offering no explanation.

At that very moment, Alexander was rushing back to Montgomery Group headquarters. His team reported a major security breach caused by hackers. If not contained immediately, the company's confidential data would be compromised.

The vice president met Alexander, visibly distressed. Wiping sweat from his brow, he said, "Sir, our firewall is state-of-the-art. I've confirmed none of our employees were involved."

Seeing his team's worried expressions, Alexander gritted his teeth. "We're clearly being targeted," he muttered.

The vice president nodded urgently. "Who would dare? We should contact the authorities immediately." In Crestwood or Halstead, challenging the Montgomery family openly was unheard of. Whoever was behind this was either incredibly bold or extremely powerful. When had Montgomery Group ever provoked such enemies?

Alexander quickly stopped him. "Don't bother calling the police. It won't help. Whoever did this isn't afraid of investigations."
###Chapter 506

The moment solitude enveloped him, Alexander Montgomery's pent-up rage erupted. Crystal vases shattered against marble floors as he concluded Mr. Jack must be behind everything.

Meanwhile, Liam Blackwood had just arrived in Crestwood with Olivia Sinclair and little Isabelle. Cradling the sleepy child, Liam suggested they find a restaurant first.

But Olivia's appetite had vanished. Alistair Kensington had been located - and inexplicably, he clung to Margaret Sinclair like a lifeline, shadowing her every move.

While Olivia could tolerate Alistair's condition, his sudden devotion to Margaret made her suspect foul play. Had Margaret drugged him? Brainwashed him? Determined for answers, Olivia rushed Alistair to Mercy Hospital for comprehensive tests. The diagnosis remained unchanged - only Alzheimer's, no other abnormalities.

For days, Margaret had been under Liam's surveillance, causing Alistair's agitation to spike. He refused meals, abandoned hobbies. With no alternative, Olivia ordered her team to bring both Alistair and Margaret to Crestwood early. Alistair had already arrived at the villa by now.

Olivia gazed at Isabelle's luminous eyes and gently pinched her rosy cheek. "Would you like to have dinner with Liam tonight?"

The child beamed, wrapping tiny arms around Liam's neck. "Yes, please."

Liam stiffened, discomfort flashing across his features. "Perhaps this isn't wise. We should postpone."

Olivia adjusted Isabelle's dress with steady hands. "Don't overthink it. I misjudged you before. You've proven yourself capable of protecting her."

"She's my entire world," Liam vowed, his arms tightening around the fragile three-year-old. Isabelle was the perfect blend of both parents - Liam's strong jawline softened by Olivia's delicate features, creating an ethereal beauty that took his breath away.

As Liam departed with Isabelle after their farewells, Olivia hurried home to chaos. She thanked fate Isabelle wasn't present to witness the scene.

Winston knelt weeping before Alistair, who leaned heavily on Margaret's arm, poised to leave. The grand parlor resembled a warzone - shattered porcelain littered the Persian rugs, overturned furniture blocking pathways.

Margaret wore triumph rather than concern, chin lifted arrogantly as she urged Alistair toward the exit. Her smirk suggested she viewed the confused old man as nothing more than a chess piece in her schemes.

Olivia helped Winston up with a grim expression. "Explain this."

Wiping tears, the butler choked out, "Your grandfather insists we're torturing him and his 'precious granddaughter.' Even at his worst, he always recognized you before. Now? Nothing."

The words carved through Olivia's heart. Something was terribly wrong, but the answer remained just beyond her grasp.
###Chapter 507

"Grandfather Alistair," Olivia approached softly. "Now that you're here with us, we'll make sure you're well taken care of. No one will harm Seraphina, but you must remain here."

The thinly veiled warning wasn't lost on Seraphina. Her expression darkened instantly. "What exactly are you implying, Olivia? Is that a threat? If you want him to forget you forever, go ahead. I've already lost everything—I just want to make sure your life isn't comfortable either."

Olivia's brows knitted tightly. What a venomous woman! she thought bitterly. Now that Seraphina had nothing left to lose, she was unpredictable.

Taking a deep breath, Olivia spoke carefully. "What do you want? If your demands are reasonable, I'll do my best to meet them."

Seraphina's demeanor shifted, and she settled onto the sofa with deliberate grace. Alistair immediately moved closer to her, his wary eyes darting around. The sight made Olivia's chest tighten.

Crossing her legs, Seraphina smirked. "Announce to the world that I'm your god-sister and that I'll be living with you from now on. As long as you support me for life, I promise I won't cause any trouble."

Before Olivia could respond, Winston quickly pulled her aside. He shook his head urgently. "Don't agree to this. She's malicious, and having her here will only bring chaos. Think carefully. Tomorrow, I'll inform Mr. Donovan Kensington. He'll take your grandfather back and deal with her properly—no more problems."

Olivia shook her head. "That's not an option."

Lately, Donovan hadn't been reaching out as frequently as before. Though he hadn't explained why, Olivia had her own sources within the Kensington family. The household was in turmoil—Frederick's branch had seized the opportunity to claim assets from Donovan's side while Alistair was absent.

Frederick's family seemed to have uncovered a mistake Donovan had made—one that could ruin him if exposed. The internal strife in the Kensington family had consumed Donovan and Reginald's attention. They had too much to handle, and retrieving Alistair and Seraphina wasn't a priority.

Olivia decided to handle this herself. After a moment of thought, she turned to Winston. "Every time Grandfather has an episode, he regains clarity briefly. Let's observe him to understand why he's acting so strangely now. Keep an eye on Seraphina—fulfill her needs without provoking her. Be patient. We'll find something."

Winston's eyes shimmered with gratitude. "Miss, your consideration for the Kensington family is deeply moving."

Gazing at Olivia, he added softly, "Miss, your grandfather might remember himself when his mind clears again." Olivia didn't respond, merely giving him a reassuring pat on the shoulder. The tension eased slightly after her words, and Seraphina stopped her provocations.

After arranging for someone to escort Alistair to rest, Olivia noticed Seraphina still lounging on the sofa, a faint smile playing on her lips. Wanting to avoid further conflict, Olivia turned to head upstairs.

Suddenly, Seraphina moved swiftly, blocking her path. "Are you angry with me? Hard to believe the tables have turned, isn't it? Despite my humble background, I'm clever—I know how to seize every opportunity. Maybe that's why you're jealous of me."

"Seriously?" Olivia crossed her arms, arching a brow. "Why would I waste energy feeling jealous of someone like you? Have you really earned that?" Seraphina's smirk faltered as she realized Olivia wasn't as passive as she'd assumed.

"Move," Olivia commanded firmly.

###Chapter 508

Olivia stood firm, her fiery gaze locking onto Margaret with dangerous intensity. "Let's make this simple - hand over Liam, and I'll release your grandfather."

A bitter laugh escaped Olivia's lips at the absurd proposition. Margaret's patience wore thin. "You clearly don't care about him. Your friends mean more to you than Liam does. Why not set him free? It's a win-win situation."

The temperature in Olivia's eyes dropped to subzero. "Move. One more threat and I'll—"

"You don't love him at all!" Margaret exploded. "Too scared to admit it? Is he just your personal ATM, your plaything? You're absolutely heartless." The words hung in the air just as Liam returned, cradling Isabelle in his arms.

Hearing Margaret's venomous words from the staircase, Liam immediately covered Isabelle's ears. "Don't listen to that noise, darling," he murmured soothingly. "Just some stray dog making unpleasant sounds."

Margaret's eyes burned crimson at the insult. Her fingers twisted the fabric of her dress into knots. "I'm defending you! Can't you see she's just using you?"

As the maid quickly ushered Isabelle away, Liam's attention shifted to the confrontation. His expression when looking at Margaret could only be described as pure revulsion.

Tears streamed down Margaret's face as she lowered her head, playing the victim perfectly. Liam turned to Olivia. "What's happening here?" Olivia barely contained her irritation. "Isn't it obvious? She's accusing me of exploiting you."

"Bullshit," Liam growled. "I'd move heaven and earth for you."

Margaret lifted her chin defiantly, gesturing toward Liam. She glared daggers at Olivia. "Enough games, Miss Kensington! Make your choice - this man or your grandfather? Remember, your grandfather obeys my every command now. Decide quickly or suffer the consequences!"

Before Olivia could respond, Liam smirked at Margaret. "Want me so badly? No need to pressure Olivia. I'll accept your terms on her behalf. What's your real game here? Planning to hurt me or use me as leverage?"

He took deliberate steps toward Margaret as he spoke.

A blush crept up Margaret's neck. "I would never harm you. It just breaks my heart to see Olivia taking advantage of you."

Liam's smirk widened. "Oh? So you're my self-appointed protector now?"

Her cheeks burned brighter. "I simply can't stand by while you're being mistreated."

Disgusted by the pathetic display, Olivia turned on her heel and strode toward the bedroom with a contemptuous sneer. Margaret continued her desperate attempts to gain Liam's attention, convinced his indifference stemmed solely from Olivia's presence.

With Olivia gone, she was certain Liam would eventually succumb to her charms.

What Margaret failed to notice was the barely contained fury in Liam's eyes. The moment Olivia disappeared, his patience evaporated. His hand shot out, closing around Margaret's slender throat. As she continued her pathetic babbling, his grip tightened just enough to make breathing difficult.

Fear flashed in Margaret's widened eyes as she gasped. "What are you doing?"

"You talk too much," Liam said icily. The smile never reached his eyes, sending chills down Margaret's spine. Overcome with terror, she dissolved into messy sobs once more.
###Chapter 509

Liam's hand shot out without warning, sending Olivia tumbling down the marble staircase. Her body bounced against the hard edges, each impact leaving angry purple bruises. By the time she reached the bottom, her whimpers were barely audible through the pain.

Margaret lay gasping at the foot of the stairs before finally choking out, "Did Evelyn put you up to this? She promised you'd be mine! How dare she betray me like this? Doesn't she know who she's dealing with?" Liam's lips curled into a cruel smirk as he descended toward her.

She scrambled backward as he approached, genuine terror flashing in her eyes. "Am I just some prize to be handed between you two?"

Liam paused to light a cigarette, the flame illuminating his chiseled features. The smoke curled around his face like a sinister halo. That handsome exterior masked something far darker - a side he only showed to those who crossed him, never to his precious Olivia.

Margaret's nails dug into the carpet as she spat through clenched teeth, "I won't accept this! I knew you were mine from the moment we met in the rain. If Evelyn doesn't want you, why can't I have you? Don't be fooled - her indifference is just an act to keep other women away!"

Liam exhaled a cloud of smoke, cutting her off mid-rant. "Let me make this perfectly clear. My disgust for you has nothing to do with Evelyn. Even if she vanished tomorrow, I'd still find you utterly repulsive."

His words landed like physical blows.

Enraged, Margaret hissed, "You forget I have Alistair wrapped around my finger!"

Liam merely arched an eyebrow, unimpressed. "And? He's not my grandfather. Did you really think you could use that old man to control me?"

Margaret's mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water, her fingers twisting in the plush carpet. The truth was, her supposed "love" for Liam wasn't nearly as deep as she pretended.

She simply needed a powerful protector. Her recent scandals in Crestwood had frozen her accounts and gotten her expelled from Westfield University, effectively destroying her future.

Yet Margaret refused to accept responsibility. Since childhood, everyone had praised her brilliance, telling her she was destined for greatness.

There was a time when influential men whispered promises of glittering futures in her ear. She'd grown up believing the world owed her everything. Ruthless ambition had always been her compass - accumulating wealth and admiration through any means necessary.

Margaret's arrogance knew no bounds. Who was Evelyn Whitmore anyway? What did it matter if the girl had actual talent? Margaret would ensure history remembered her as the true heroine of this story. Evelyn was merely a pawn in her grand design.

But she hadn't accounted for Olivia Sinclair's arrival. Beautiful, brilliant, and impossibly wealthy, Olivia had effortlessly dismantled all Margaret's carefully laid plans. The injustice burned. Determined to rebuild her empire, Margaret sought powerful new alliances.

She remembered that first encounter with Liam vividly - tall and devastatingly handsome beneath his black umbrella in the storm, like some romantic hero sent by fate. She'd been certain they were meant to be. Yet despite her best efforts, she couldn't capture his attention. Now it was clear she'd never secure Liam's protection.

Margaret reasoned that if she could expose Olivia's weaknesses, she might at least secure temporary financial stability. But as someone who believed herself born to be the protagonist of every story, how could Margaret possibly accept living in Olivia's shadow?

Her bitter musings were interrupted by a voice from above. "How's everything going down there? Have you handled our little problem?" Olivia's melodic tones carried down the staircase.
###Chapter 510

Olivia emerged wearing a silk nightgown that shimmered under the dim lighting. The delicate fabric draped over her flawless curves with effortless elegance rather than deliberate seduction. Her striking features were set in an expression of icy authority, radiating the untouchable aura of a goddess.

Margaret Sinclair felt bitterness rise in her throat like bile. Her fingernails carved crescent moons into her palms, yet the physical pain couldn't distract from the emotional turmoil.

Seeing an opportunity to cause discord, Margaret taunted, "Olivia, did you know Liam doesn't care about your grandfather at all? He just admitted it moments ago." Liam remained perfectly composed, his lips even curling into an amused smirk.

Olivia folded her arms, her glacial stare pinning Margaret in place. "Call a physician for Margaret. Ensure she survives - she may still have some value."

Margaret stood frozen, realizing her petty schemes were child's play compared to Olivia's strategic mind.

Back in her chambers, Olivia rubbed her temples as exhaustion weighed on her. The sudden chime of an incoming video call made her glance at the screen - Donovan Kensington's name flashed across the display.

"Olivia," Donovan's face appeared, shockingly gaunt. Dark shadows bruised his bloodshot eyes, and several days' worth of stubble covered his hollowed cheeks.

Olivia gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. "My God, what's happened? Tell me what's wrong. Whatever you need, I'm here."

"I'm managing," Donovan replied with a tired smile that didn't reach his eyes.

"The Kensington affairs have been... overwhelming lately. With grandfather in Eldermere and father preoccupied handling Frederick's power plays, the family responsibilities fall entirely on my shoulders."

Olivia exhaled slowly, choosing her next words with precision. "You don't have to say it - I can see you're facing something serious. As a shareholder in Kensington Holdings, I want to help you through this."

"Appreciated," Donovan murmured, the word heavy with resignation.

Donovan had maintained a long-term relationship with a woman he'd never introduced to his family - a famous actress from Eldermere's entertainment circles. The Kensingtons would never accept such a match.

When he finally decided to reveal their relationship, he discovered confidential company documents had been leaked. His lover had been working with Frederick's associates all along - a carefully planted pawn in Frederick's game.

Naive in matters of the heart, Donovan had fallen for the deception. He'd planned only to confront her and end things cleanly. The betrayal cut deep, yet he harbored no desire for revenge.

He waited all night at their special meeting place by the cliffs, but she never came. Instead, a woman's mangled body was discovered at the base of the ravine.

Public opinion quickly branded Donovan as the killer. The victim's family, manipulated by Frederick, used the tragedy to pressure Donovan into resigning his position.

Overwhelmed by the accusations, Donovan couldn't gather evidence to clear his name. Local authorities, swayed by apparent motive and opportunity, named him their prime suspect.
###Chapter 511

Olivia's breath hitched as the weight of Donovan's words settled upon her. "How can I help?" she asked urgently, fingers tightening around her phone.

Donovan's voice crackled through the line after a thoughtful pause. "I believe she's still alive, but I've got no concrete evidence. No family ties except for that actress sister in Eldermere. Olivia, I'm trapped in this mess, and it might drag you in too. Think carefully before committing."

A wry smile curved Olivia's lips as she answered without hesitation. "I don't do illegal, Donovan. Besides, what good would your downfall bring me? They already consider us allies." She shifted on the bed, sheets rustling. "Send me everything you've got. We'll figure this out together."

"Deal," Donovan agreed.

Suddenly, a wave of nausea crashed over Olivia. Acid burned her throat as she clutched her stomach, the room spinning. She barely made it to the ensuite bathroom before emptying her stomach.

When she returned, Donovan's concerned voice pierced through her fog. "Olivia? You okay? You sound terrible."

"Just exhaustion," she deflected, wiping her clammy forehead. "We both need rest. Talk tomorrow." She ended the call before he could protest.

Alone in the dim bedroom, Olivia pressed trembling hands against her abdomen. The fluttering sensation felt hauntingly familiar. Two pregnancies had taught her body's signals, yet she refused to believe it. One night with Liam couldn't possibly... Could it? She'd schedule a doctor's appointment tomorrow. This had to be stress.

The door burst open before she could spiral further. Isabelle bounded in, dragging her favorite starry quilt. "Mommy!" The six-year-old launched onto the bed with practiced ease, eyes wide with innocence. "Can I sleep here tonight? Please?"

Olivia's heart melted as she pulled her daughter close, inhaling the strawberry shampoo scent. "Of course, sweetheart. Which story tonight?"

Isabelle randomly selected a well-worn fairytale from the nightstand. Halfway through, drowsy fingers tangled with Olivia's. "Mommy?" Isabelle's sleepy murmur came. "Why don't I have a brother or sister like Jamie does?"

Olivia's breath caught. She smoothed Isabelle's hair, voice barely above a whisper. "Don't you like having Mommy all to yourself?"

Isabelle's response dissolved into soft snores before Olivia could decipher it. Cradling her daughter, Olivia stared at the ceiling, one hand resting on her stomach as unanswered questions swirled through the darkness.

###Chapter 512

Olivia had been racking her brain for days, desperately searching for a way to assist Donovan. The solution came unexpectedly when Amelia forwarded an invitation three weeks prior. Had it not been for Amelia's persistent reminders, the email would have been lost in Olivia's overflowing inbox.

A brilliant idea struck Olivia like lightning. She instructed Amelia to discreetly obtain the guest list for the upcoming reality show. Wealth had its privileges, and doors opened effortlessly. When the list arrived, one name immediately caught Olivia's attention. Without hesitation, she decided to participate.

The show, "Countryside Chronicles," blended rural living with celebrity culture, featuring influencers and public figures with massive followings. Olivia's recent bold intervention during the Sinclair Enterprises crisis in Newport had unexpectedly thrust her into the spotlight. Ironically, she owed this sudden fame to Margaret Sinclair, whose viral social media posts had drawn national attention to the situation.

As Olivia's public profile rose, the production team eagerly extended a personal invitation. Engrossed in finalizing business deals, she'd initially overlooked it. When Olivia announced her decision to join, Amelia's jaw dropped. "You're actually considering a reality show?" she gasped in disbelief.

During her years with the Kensingtons, numerous people had urged Olivia to enter show business. They constantly praised her striking beauty and promised instant success with the family's connections. But Olivia had always refused. While financial security mattered, she valued personal fulfillment more. She wanted recognition for her intellect and business acumen, not just her appearance.

International modeling scouts had pursued her relentlessly, but Olivia never entertained their offers. Amelia wondered if this marked a change in Olivia's stance toward the entertainment world she'd previously avoided. Without elaborate explanations, Olivia simply instructed Amelia to make the necessary arrangements.

Despite the three-week delay, the producers were thrilled to secure Olivia's participation. Filming for the first episode had already commenced, so Olivia would debut in the second installment. That evening, she studied the show's promotional materials, noting the picturesque village location. The pastoral setting would be entirely new for the cosmopolitan businesswoman.

After her evening routine, Isabelle climbed onto Olivia's lap, her golden curls spilling over Olivia's silk robe. Gazing at her daughter's innocent face, Olivia's heart swelled with warmth.

"Mommy," Isabelle inquired, pointing at the brochure, "Where is this magical place? It's so pretty! Are you going on an adventure? Can I come?" Olivia hesitated before explaining the nature of reality television and why this wasn't a family trip.

She preferred keeping Isabelle away from the public eye. Childhood should be protected, not displayed for entertainment.
###Chapter 513

Olivia's heart was torn. The upcoming fashion show in Paris loomed before her, but her thoughts kept circling back to Isabelle. Who would care for her precious daughter while she was away? The idea of leaving Isabelle with Liam crossed her mind, but the mere thought made her stomach churn.

Isabelle's small hands suddenly clutched Olivia's fingers, her eyes shining like twin stars. "Mommy! When I grow up, I want to be famous like those singers on TV!"

Olivia blinked in surprise. Instead of reprimanding, she gathered Isabelle into a warm embrace, playfully bopping her nose. "Why a pop star, sweetheart? Why not follow in Mommy's footsteps and run the company someday?"

The little girl scrunched up her face. "Numbers are boring! I don't understand all those papers on your desk."

A chuckle escaped Olivia as she remembered Isabelle's preschool teacher's comments. Her daughter was brilliant - absorbing knowledge like a sponge in every subject except mathematics. The moment numbers appeared, Isabelle's eyelids would grow heavy, her attention wandering to more colorful pursuits. Arithmetic simply wasn't in her DNA.

Olivia carried secret dreams for her daughter. She wanted to give Isabelle the world, yet refused to cage her potential with predetermined expectations. Children were like unopened flower buds - why obsess over what color they'd bloom when the magic lay in watching them unfold?

She never stressed about Isabelle's future path. Whatever destiny held, this bright-eyed girl would always be her greatest treasure. Every late night at the office, every business deal closed, was for one purpose - to ensure Isabelle's future remained full of possibilities.

With this thought, Olivia pressed a tender kiss to Isabelle's rosy cheek. "Alright, my little star. You'll come with Mommy to the fashion show. You'll meet real celebrities there."

Isabelle clapped her hands in delight, her joyful giggles wrapping around Olivia's heart like golden ribbons.

Before the trip, Olivia carved out time for a crucial hospital visit. When the doctor announced the results, her fingers dug into her coat's hem, knuckles turning white. Then, like morning mist burning away, the anxiety that had shadowed her for weeks suddenly evaporated.

"How?" Olivia's voice trembled. "All my previous tests showed my endometrium was too thin. After the miscarriages, every specialist said conception was nearly impossible. This can't be real."

The doctor adjusted her glasses, offering a reassuring smile. "Nearly impossible isn't the same as completely impossible. Your recent health improvements have been remarkable - better nutrition, reduced stress, overall wellness. And the baby's father must be quite healthy too. Still, I recommend frequent checkups. We've confirmed the pregnancy, but carrying to term will depend on the coming months' developments."

"How far along am I?" Olivia asked, fingers unconsciously drifting to her still-flat stomach.

"Approximately four weeks," the doctor replied.

Four weeks? Olivia's mind reeled. She'd noticed nothing unusual these past weeks.

Leaving the examination room, Olivia wandered the hospital corridors in a daze. The medical report in her hands felt heavier than lead. Should she keep this child? Logic screamed no. Her relationship with Liam was shattered beyond repair. Isabelle already grew up without a complete family. Bringing another life into this complicated situation seemed cruel.

Yet...

Her fingers trembled as they traced the ultrasound image. A tiny heartbeat fluttered beneath the grainy black-and-white surface. How could something so small already feel so precious?

The war inside Olivia raged on as she stepped into the afternoon sunlight, her shadow stretching long behind her. One path led to practicality and reason. The other... the other led somewhere terrifying and beautiful all at once.
###Chapter 514

Olivia's mind swirled with conflicting emotions as she left the doctor's office. The pregnancy test results burned a hole in her purse, yet she couldn't bring herself to make any hasty decisions. There was still time to consider her options carefully.

As she straightened her coat, a familiar figure rounded the corner. Evelyn Hartley stood frozen, her bloodshot eyes widening in recognition. The woman looked gaunt, her movements stiff and unnatural as she swayed on her feet.

Olivia immediately quickened her pace, but Evelyn suddenly pivoted and blocked her path. With surprising speed, Evelyn yanked the medical report from Olivia's grasp. Her eyes darted across the page before her lips curled into a venomous smirk.

"Pregnant?" Evelyn's shrill voice cut through the hospital corridor. "Again? Who's the unfortunate father this time? Or do you even know?" She let out a cruel laugh. "Some things never change, do they? Still spreading your legs for any man who glances your way."

Olivia saw red. Before she could stop herself, her palm connected with Evelyn's cheek in a resounding slap that echoed down the hallway. The impact sent Evelyn staggering backward, the report fluttering to the floor.

"None of your damn business," Olivia hissed through clenched teeth as she retrieved the document.

Evelyn clutched her stinging cheek, outrage flashing in her eyes. "You bitch! How dare you—"

"I'll do more than that if you don't back off," Olivia countered coldly, her smile not reaching her eyes.

Evelyn's face contorted with rage. This wasn't the meek Olivia she'd once bullied into submission. The transformation was startling—and infuriating.

Undeterred, Evelyn raised her voice, broadcasting Olivia's pregnancy to the growing crowd. "Look at this shameless woman! Knocked up with some random man's bastard! What kind of mother—"

"Shut your filthy mouth!" A woman in scrubs snapped. "There's nothing wrong with being a single mother."

"Yeah, who are you to judge?" another bystander chimed in. "Divorce doesn't mean she can't find love again."

The tide of public opinion turned swiftly against Evelyn. Her confident sneer faltered as more people voiced their disapproval. "That's not what I—I only meant her!" Evelyn sputtered, pointing at Olivia. "She's been with half the men in Newport! This child probably doesn't even know its own father!"

"Enough!" A deep voice thundered through the corridor. Sebastian Whitmore pushed through the crowd, his jaw clenched so tightly the muscle twitched visibly. His stormy gaze pinned Evelyn in place like a butterfly to a board.
###Chapter 515

Olivia's breath hitched when Sebastian Whitmore appeared in the hospital corridor. Her pulse quickened when she noticed Liam Blackwood standing beside him. How much had they overheard? Behind his medical mask, Liam's piercing gaze held unreadable depths as it locked onto hers.

Her fingers clenched around the medical report until the edges crumpled. Every instinct screamed at her to flee. Sebastian's jaw tightened as he turned toward Evelyn, whose defiant posture radiated hostility. His voice dropped to a venomous whisper. "Have you forgotten our agreement? You're carrying my child now. Must you always speak with such poison?"

Tears shimmered in Evelyn's eyes as she bit her quivering lip. Playing the wounded victim perfectly, she hissed, "I'm merely stating facts! Aren't you shocked about Olivia's condition? Why defend her? Is that your bastard she's carrying?" The venomous words barely carried beyond their immediate circle.

Olivia couldn't look away from Liam's masked face. His silence was more unnerving than any outburst. What thoughts lay behind that impassive facade?

Sebastian's control snapped. "One more word and I'll have you shipped back to your parents tonight. My debt to you doesn't grant license to manipulate me. Push me further and you'll regret it."

Evelyn's bravado shattered. She shrunk into herself, shoulders hunched in fearful submission. After subduing his wife, Sebastian forced a conciliatory smile toward Olivia and Liam. "My apologies. Pregnancy hormones have made Evelyn... volatile. The baby's complications exacerbate her distress. Any offense caused is my responsibility."

Olivia's eyes widened. Sebastian and Evelyn were expecting? She knew their marriage was arranged, but a child? The torment in Sebastian's expression revealed this wasn't a joyful development. Not her circus, not her monkeys, Olivia decided.

As Sebastian led Evelyn away, the pregnant woman threw one last glance over her shoulder. Her icy stare lingered on Olivia's abdomen, predatory and calculating. Olivia suppressed a shudder.

Alone with Liam now, Olivia searched his face. "Why are you here with Sebastian?"

"I went to your penthouse," Liam admitted. "Isabelle said you'd gone to Mercy Hospital. Trent mentioned you weren't feeling well." His gaze dropped to the crumpled report in her hands. "We ran into Sebastian at admissions."

Her knuckles whitened around the paper. "How much did you hear?"

Liam's eyes crinkled with hidden amusement. "If you'd prefer me to play deaf, darling, just say the word—"
###Chapter 516

Liam's gaze lingered on the document clutched in Olivia's trembling fingers. "I won't push you to reveal anything before you're ready."

Despite his reassurance, Olivia's thoughts churned like stormy seas. She hurled the report into the nearest bin with a frustrated sigh. "I'll hold you to that promise." Brushing past Liam, she strode toward the exit, her heels clicking sharply against the tile.

Liam shadowed her steps, his voice uncharacteristically tender. "Did I upset you by coming? If my presence bothers you, I won't intrude again." The humility in his tone was jarring—this wasn’t the ruthless "Blackwood Enigma" the world feared.

Olivia wasn’t angry. Just... adrift. The weight of recent events pressed down until her ribs ached. Pausing mid-step, she turned to face him, regret twisting her features. "That’s not what I meant. It’s been... a lot. I’m tired."

A gust of wind rattled the windows. Without hesitation, Liam shrugged off his tailored coat and draped it over her shoulders, his fingers lingering a heartbeat too long. "I get it. I just wanted to see you’re okay. If you are, I’ll go."

She caught his wrist as he turned, cursing her traitorous heart. "Stay for dinner," she muttered. "Isabelle keeps asking for you."

The change in Liam was instantaneous—his eyes, usually so guarded, lit up like dawn breaking over the city. He fell into step beside her, his masked face doing little to hide the smile in his voice. By the time they reached her penthouse, he’d negotiated his way into cooking, rolling up his sleeves with the focus of a surgeon prepping for operation.

In Olivia’s kitchen, Liam shed his public persona along with the mask. The apron strings strained against his broad shoulders as he moved with precision, each slice of the knife deliberate. Golden stove light caught the sharp angles of his face, softening the man who’d once frozen boardrooms with a glance.

The spread he prepared—Isabelle’s favorite lemon-glazed salmon, Olivia’s truffle risotto—was obscenely perfect. Their daughter beamed, swinging their joined hands between them like this was any normal family dinner.

Alistair joined them, more present than he’d been in weeks. The haunted look in his eyes had dulled, though his gaze kept darting to the door. Olivia knew who he was searching for. Reluctantly, she called Margaret.

The woman who arrived was a ghost of herself—pale, brittle, drowning in a sweater that hung off her frame. Olivia hadn’t laid a finger on her since that night in the vault, when Margaret tried to trade Alistair’s freedom for Liam’s demise. Karma, it seemed, had collected its debt in sleepless nights and hollow cheeks.

Margaret didn’t sit. Didn’t speak. Just hovered near Alistair like a shadow, her fingers twitching toward him before curling into fists.

Olivia watched Liam—his knife never faltering as he diced herbs, his gaze flicking to Margaret with icy calculation. The air thickened with unspoken threats.

Isabelle, oblivious, giggled as she stole a cherry tomato from Liam’s cutting board. He pretended to scowl, tapping her nose with flour-dusted fingers.

Two worlds colliding in a penthouse kitchen.

And Olivia, stranded between them.
###Chapter 517

Liam had given his men one simple order—deal with Margaret. Everyone in his inner circle knew Olivia was the only woman he'd ever loved, so they showed no mercy. Yet Margaret couldn't blame Olivia; she could only curse her own stupidity.

When Margaret saw Liam remove his mask, her breath caught in her throat. "I thought you never took that off," she rasped, her voice trembling with shock.

Liam merely shot her an icy glare before turning away. Olivia had no interest in engaging with her either.

Isabelle rolled her eyes dramatically. "He only takes it off around my mother because he trusts her completely," she said pointedly. "You'd never see his face otherwise." The words struck Margaret like a physical blow. Despite her young age, Isabelle was far from naive.

Alistair returned, and Isabelle had been eagerly awaiting this moment. Yet he ignored everyone. Though Olivia tried to comfort her daughter, Isabelle remained despondent. She blamed Margaret for locking Alistair away and drugging him into forgetting them.

Understanding the implication, Margaret sneered viciously, "Don't get too comfortable. I doubt your mother and Liam will last. You'll always be fatherless."

Bang! Olivia slammed her spoon down with such force the table shook. Her piercing gaze locked onto Margaret. "Do you truly believe I won't touch you just because you're controlling my grandfather?"

Panicked, Margaret tried to reach Alistair for protection. But bodyguards blocked her path. Alistair continued eating, completely indifferent to Margaret's plight. In his altered state, having Margaret nearby was all that mattered.

Margaret's face flushed crimson with rage before draining of all color. With no other choice, she dropped to her knees and apologized to Isabelle. When she rose, her eyes burned with undisguised hatred for the three of them.

That night, both Olivia and Isabelle were struck with excruciating stomach pains. Liam, who hadn't left yet, rushed to their side when he got the news. Seeing their ashen faces, he felt genuine panic for the first time in his life. But he quickly composed himself and ordered Winston to get them to Mercy Hospital immediately.

As they prepared to leave, determination flashed in Liam's eyes. He called Sebastian, instructing him to come at once and keep watch over Margaret.

Thanks to their swift arrival at the hospital, Olivia and Isabelle would recover with treatment. But Olivia's pregnancy complicated matters—she nearly miscarried. Liam had suspected she was pregnant when he saw her at the hospital earlier. At the time, she'd seemed despondent and unwilling to see him.

Assuming she wanted to terminate the pregnancy, Liam had felt a pang of sorrow but respected her decision. Now, as Olivia lay drenched in sweat, her face ghostly pale, she clung to Liam's hand and murmured deliriously, "My baby...save my baby..."

Liam's composure cracked. "You...you want to keep it?" he asked, voice thick with emotion.
###Chapter 518

Olivia's eyelids fluttered shut. Oblivious to her earlier exchange with Liam, her fingers instinctively curled into the fabric covering her abdomen. "This is my child. I must protect it."

Tears welled in Liam's eyes. Just then, the physician entered. Liam swiftly schooled his expression, though the tremor in his voice betrayed his anguish. "She's expecting. Do whatever it takes to save her. If the baby can't be saved... so be it. I'll bear the responsibility."

The doctor gave a solemn nod. Fortunately, Olivia had ingested only a trace of the toxin and had undergone immediate gastric lavage. Both mother and child were out of immediate danger.

The physician kept his tone grave. "The fetus is stable for now, but the toxin exposure remains a concern. Even at this early stage, there could be lasting effects. The mother must be informed so she's prepared for any complications."

Liam's lips twisted into a humorless smile. "Perhaps you should be the one to tell her when she wakes. I'm... not the right person to deliver that news."

The doctor frowned. "I assumed you were her—"

Liam cut him off with a shake of his head. "No. And don't mention my presence. She wouldn't welcome it."

After Liam's departure, the nurses exchanged hushed whispers.

"Even with that mask, you could tell he's devastatingly handsome. The way he looked at her—like she was his entire world."

"Did you see how his hands shook? When he first rushed in, his shirt was soaked through with sweat. And when the doctor mentioned risks to the baby? I thought he might collapse."

Unbeknownst to them, Olivia caught fragments of their conversation through the fog of sedation. A desperate curiosity about this mysterious man tugged at her, but exhaustion dragged her back under before she could speak.

Time blurred. When consciousness next claimed Olivia, darkness still cloaked the hospital room. Medical staff moved in quiet efficiency, and Sebastian stood vigil at her bedside.

Panic surged through Olivia the moment coherence returned. "Where's Isabelle?" Her voice cracked as she fought to throw off the sheets, her body weak but determined to search for her daughter. Sebastian hurried to reassure her. "Miss Kensington, there's no need for alarm. Your daughter is not only safe—she's thriving. She's awake, full of energy, and the doctors even recommended she have some broth."

Olivia exhaled in relief. Then, her hand drifted to her stomach, her pulse stuttering with dread. Was the baby still there? Liam must have known.

Noticing her distress, Sebastian cleared his throat. "Mr. Blackwood believes the decision rests entirely with you as the mother. He's... overjoyed, but he hasn't forgotten Mr. Kensington's warnings about Isabelle's traumatic birth. He doesn't want you to endure that agony again."

Olivia's lashes lifted in surprise. She had expected Liam to demand the child be kept at all costs. A flicker of something unreadable passed through her eyes before she changed the subject. "Where is Liam now? Have we uncovered who's responsible?"

###Chapter 519

Sebastian Montgomery gave a solemn nod, stepping closer with lowered voice. "It was Margaret. Do you still have energy left? She went after both you and Isabelle. Mr. Blackwood demanded we handle her mercilessly, but I believe he's gone too far."

Before Sebastian's words fully dissipated, Olivia Sinclair was already struggling to sit up. "Take me there," she demanded urgently.

Outside Mercy Hospital, a sleek limousine idled near the entrance. Inside, Margaret Sinclair lay crumpled on the floor, her body a canvas of crimson stains. Only the faint movement of her chest betrayed any sign of life. Liam Blackwood sat beside her, his gaze burning with lethal intensity. Though he'd already exacted punishment, his fury remained unquenched. The memory of Olivia and Isabelle being rushed into the emergency room - gasping, pale-faced - still clawed at his heart.

Margaret was a cornered serpent, unpredictable and deadly. Alive, she remained a perpetual threat, always coiled to strike or escape, endangering others even in captivity. Sensing her precarious position, Margaret taunted Liam through bloodied lips. "Go ahead, kill me. Murder carries consequences, darling. Do it, and you'll never walk openly with Olivia again. It'll haunt little Isabelle too. My death would poison your future with them. Doesn't that sound... poetic?"

Her barbed words found their mark. Liam's dark eyes narrowed like a raptor's, his voice glacial as he commanded his men. "Didn't you hear her request? Dispose of her. Dump the body at sea!"

"Liam!" The command froze as Olivia appeared, leaning heavily on Sebastian. Clad in a hospital gown, her pallor matched the sterile walls, fragility evident in every movement. At her appearance, Liam's demeanor shifted instantly. The storm in his eyes calmed as he rushed to support her.

Liam shot Sebastian a venomous glare. "Sebastian, do you wish to join her?"

Sebastian averted his gaze silently. Olivia grasped Liam's hand with surprising strength. Normally resistant to showing weakness around him, her current state left no choice but to lean into his embrace.

"Liam, can we discuss this?" Olivia's voice carried no command, only vulnerable exhaustion.

Liam felt the unnatural chill of her fingers, concern spiking. Without hesitation, he shrugged off his tailored jacket, wrapping it around her shoulders. His distinctive scent enveloped her like a protective shield, the immediate proximity seeming to steady Olivia's nerves. A forced cough shattered the moment. "I'm stronger than I look," she insisted. "But I'm serious about this. You can't kill Margaret or continue harming her. We need to end this cycle. My carelessness gave her the opening to hurt me and our daughter. Think of Isabelle's future."

Liam trembled with barely contained rage, a tempest barely leashed by Olivia's calming presence. His gaze flicked to Margaret, whose defiant smirk remained. "But Olivia, I can't risk her hurting you again. I've considered how to handle Alistair - return him to the Kensingtons or have my men deal with him. Either way, Margaret can't stay."

Olivia shook her head gently. "No need for extremes. Just ensure she's no longer a threat. Let her live." The words triggered another violent coughing fit.
###Chapter 520

The moment Olivia collapsed, Liam's heart stopped. Without hesitation, he scooped her into his arms and rushed toward Mercy Hospital. As he passed Margaret Sinclair still sprawled on the floor, his gaze flickered over her for just a second before he kept moving.

Liam carried Olivia back to her private ward and immediately called for the doctors. Relief flooded through him when they confirmed she was stable. He vowed not to leave her side for the next few days, settling into the chair beside her bed like a sentinel. The entire night, he didn’t sleep a wink, his body rigid with tension as he watched over her. Olivia was exhausted, but sleep wouldn’t come—her mind was racing too fast.

She shifted restlessly under the sheets, and Liam immediately stood, adjusting the blankets around her with careful hands. His voice was rough with concern. "Are you in pain? Should I call the doctor back?"

Olivia shook her head with a faint smile. "Sit down," she murmured. "We need to talk."

Liam stiffened, sensing the weight of what was coming. Slowly, he sank back into the chair, his hands clenching into fists on his knees. He looked like a man bracing for a verdict.

Amusement flickered in Olivia’s eyes as she reached for his hand. After a brief hesitation, Liam extended it, his fingers trembling slightly. She guided his palm to rest against her stomach, letting the warmth of his touch linger there.

"It’s too early for you to feel anything," she said softly. "But when I was alone before, this was the only way I could sleep—just touching my stomach, knowing there was life inside me. When Isabelle was born, I almost didn’t make it. That moment… it was like she was the one keeping me alive, not the other way around." Her voice wavered. "This feeling… it’s just like when I was pregnant with her. How could I ever walk away from that?"

Liam opened his mouth, then closed it again, struggling for words. Finally, he spoke, his voice thick with worry. "I don’t want to see you in pain again. Another child isn’t worth your suffering. You and Isabelle—you’re everything to me. I don’t need anything else."

Olivia shook her head, her expression resolute. "No. I’m keeping this baby. It’s mine. I want this."

Liam looked stunned, his breath catching. He swallowed hard, clearly wrestling with her words. "But… you hated me. How can you—?"

Olivia cut him off gently. "Let’s leave the past where it belongs. This child shouldn’t carry the weight of our mistakes." She hesitated, then tightened her grip on his hand. "Maybe I shouldn’t say this, but… for our children, I want to give Isabelle and this baby a stable family." She took a deep breath. "So I’m willing to remarry you. But it would be in name only. If you find someone else—or if I do—we part ways peacefully."

Liam’s face was unreadable, his silence stretching between them. But his hand betrayed him, trembling against hers. Slowly, he leaned forward, pressing a kiss to her forehead. His voice was rough when he finally spoke. "Olivia… you’re not just saying this to convince me, are you?"

A quiet laugh escaped her. "You know I don’t joke about things like this."

The air between them shifted, heavy with unspoken promises.

###Chapter 521

Liam's lips curved into a tender smile as his fingers traced gentle circles over her swollen belly. "Thank you, darling. Your mother is finally willing to acknowledge me properly."

Olivia rolled her eyes, though affection warmed her voice. "Must you phrase it like that? You sound like some neglected husband."

"Can you blame me?" Liam countered, his tone laced with playful melancholy.

After being discharged from Mercy Hospital, Olivia returned home with Isabelle in tow. The moment they stepped inside, her gaze landed on Margaret. The once-proud woman was now a shadow of her former self, giggling vacantly at nothing in particular.

Sebastian moved to Olivia's side, his voice a hushed murmur. "She's harmless now."

Olivia studied Margaret with detached pity. The woman had orchestrated her own downfall. Had she not threatened them with Alistair, had she not forced her way into their lives—drugging both Olivia and Isabelle in her desperate power play—she might have lived comfortably in Newport.

But greed had sealed her fate.

Even with her darkest deeds exposed, the world would move on. People always did. If she behaved, she could still carve out some semblance of existence. Olivia turned to Winston. "Where's Grandpa? Does he know about Margaret's... condition?"

"Don't fret, Miss," Winston assured her. "Your grandfather may still dote on her, but as long as she remains here under supervision, all will be well." He hesitated before adding, "I've prepared a modest room for her near the garden. During our daily walks, your grandfather will see her. That should suffice."

Olivia exhaled, tension leaving her shoulders. "Good. Thank you."

With Margaret handled, Olivia's thoughts drifted back to Liam. She'd decided to remarry him, but there was no rush. She wasn't ready for Isabelle to call him "Dad" yet. Her daughter was perceptive but fragile—one misstep could wound her deeply.

Fate intervened when filming for the show commenced. Olivia seized the opportunity, inviting Liam to join them on set. Perhaps, she reasoned, time together would let them bond naturally.

Yet by the trip's end, Olivia realized her concerns had been unnecessary. Liam and Isabelle clicked effortlessly, their laughter ringing through the air as if they'd known each other forever.

Liam adored Isabelle with every fiber of his being. His eyes never strayed from her, as though she might vanish the moment he blinked. He hovered protectively, attending to her every whim for hours. Olivia massaged her temples, suppressing a fond sigh. "Liam, she isn't glass. You're spoiling her rotten."

He met her gaze, a soft smile playing on his lips. "I know. But I missed her first four years. Let me make up for lost time."

Olivia relented. With Liam watching over Isabelle so diligently, she could actually relax for once.

She opted against staying in the crew's arranged lodgings. Privacy was paramount with her family present. No one questioned her decision—not when she'd invested heavily in the production. To them, she was as much a sponsor as a cast member. As long as she adhered to the rules, they granted her leeway.

###Chapter 522

The trio settled into a charming countryside cottage. While not as luxurious as their penthouse back in Newport, the rustic charm made it ideal for their temporary home. Warm wooden beams and floral curtains created an inviting atmosphere that instantly put them at ease.

For little Isabelle, every moment was pure magic. Having never experienced rural life before, her boundless energy led her to investigate every nook and cranny. From chasing butterflies to collecting wildflowers, her laughter filled the air as she discovered the simple joys of country living.

Liam, ever the protective father, shadowed Isabelle's every move. "Watch your step, princess," he'd murmur whenever she ventured too close to the stone fence or muddy puddles. His watchful gaze never wavered, though his stern warnings were always softened by an affectionate smile.

While Isabelle napped, Olivia reviewed the show's participant list. Two civilians and two celebrities would join them - a university student and a tech startup founder representing ordinary life, while Olivia herself fell into the latter category. The celebrity lineup included Victoria Ellington, whose younger sister had once caught Donovan Kensington's eye.

Victoria possessed striking features that defied conventional beauty standards. Where others cultivated delicate femininity, she radiated bold confidence that commanded attention. Olivia could understand why Donovan had been so taken with her sister.

The second celebrity was an unfamiliar actress whose breathtaking beauty seemed almost unnatural. Olivia studied her photo, struck by an odd sense of recognition that hovered just beyond conscious memory. Before she could place the face, strong arms encircled her waist from behind.

"Time to call it a night," Liam murmured against her ear, his breath warm against her skin. "Isabelle finally wore herself out. I've drawn you a bath - Hazel will keep an ear out for her."

Olivia turned in his embrace, arching an eyebrow. "Since when did you become so domestic?"

Liam's fingers intertwined with hers as his voice dropped to a husky whisper. "Oh darling, this is just the beginning..." The smoldering look in his dark eyes left little to imagination.

With practiced ease, Olivia slipped free with a playful swat. "Dream on. I'm going to bed."

Emerging from her bath wrapped in a plush robe, Olivia found Liam sprawled dramatically across their bed. The exaggerated pout on his handsome face would've been comical if not for the very real heat in his gaze.

"Really?" She towel-dried her hair with an exasperated sigh. "What's your excuse tonight?"

Liam pointed solemnly toward the window where dark clouds gathered. "Storm's coming."

Olivia crossed her arms. "You haven't been afraid of thunder since you were six."

"True," Liam admitted, his expression turning unexpectedly serious. "But I remember someone who is."

Olivia's breath caught. After all these years, he still remembered her childhood fear. Isabelle, thankfully, shared none of her mother's storm anxiety. During thunderstorms, the little girl would curl protectively against Olivia, offering silent comfort. While the phobia had lessened over time, Olivia still struggled to sleep through severe weather. With filming starting tomorrow, the impending storm promised a restless night ahead.
###Chapter 523

Without speaking, Liam moved closer and carefully took the hairdryer from Olivia's hand, his fingers threading gently through her damp strands. "It's fine," he murmured. "I'll keep you company tonight. If it bothers you, I can stay by the window. The bed is all yours."

Olivia studied him, her voice hushed. "Don't be ridiculous. You'll freeze sleeping there, and then I'll have to nurse you back to health."

A soft smile played on Liam's lips. "Concerned about my wellbeing?"

Olivia scoffed but remained silent. After drying her hair, Liam effortlessly lifted her and settled her onto the bed. Keeping his promise, he made no advances, simply wrapping his arms around her, his hand rhythmically stroking her back in a comforting motion.

Olivia squirmed slightly, her cheeks flushing. "I'm not a child, Liam. You don't need to tuck me in like this."

Liam leaned closer, inhaling her familiar fragrance. He exhaled slowly, his voice barely above a whisper. "Every time I hold you like this, I keep thinking it might be another dream. I'm terrified that when I wake, I'll be back in that foreign prison cell, separated from you and Isabelle. The thought of you two was my only lifeline."

Drowsiness creeping in, Olivia asked sleepily, "What really happened overseas? You never told me... But I can imagine it was dangerous."

Liam didn't respond immediately. He simply watched as her breathing evened out, sleep claiming her. Pressing a featherlight kiss to her forehead, he whispered, "The past doesn't define us anymore."

For the first time in years, Olivia slept soundly through the raging storm outside.

At six the next morning, Olivia's alarm buzzed softly. She had intended to rise early, prepare breakfast, and let Isabelle sleep in. But when she entered the kitchen, she froze at the unexpected sight - Liam, clad in an apron, already busy at work.

Olivia stared in disbelief. Liam Blackwood, heir to the prestigious Blackwood dynasty of Crestwood, was cooking breakfast and cleaning her kitchen. The scene was so surreal that if anyone heard about it, they'd never believe it.

After breakfast, Olivia and Isabelle departed together. Olivia had anticipated potential hiccups, but she hadn't expected everything to derail so spectacularly on the first day. Due to a production error, Olivia had been given the wrong call time. Though she typically arrived early, this miscommunication resulted in her being twenty minutes late.

Upon arrival, a flustered crew member rushed over, beads of sweat on their forehead. "Our deepest apologies, Miss Kensington. We initially scheduled for the time we gave you, but there was a last-minute change. We updated everyone through a group chat, and I didn't realize you weren't included."

Olivia's eyebrows arched as she noticed three young individuals nearby. "Who created this group?" she inquired.

An employee quickly answered, "It was organized by Victoria Ellington. The group admin is another actress - Miranda Graves."
###Chapter 524

Olivia Sinclair was far from naive. Within moments, she detected the subtle tension in the air. It was their first day of filming, and none of the cast members had been properly introduced yet. While Olivia had managed to review the guest list beforehand due to her connections with the director, what about the others? Maybe it was just first-day jitters.

When the production crew discreetly asked if she needed clarification about the unfolding dynamics, Olivia shook her head with practiced grace. Asking questions now would appear unprofessional. The window for inquiries had closed. Besides, it seemed insignificant compared to the bigger picture. Hand in hand with little Isabelle, Olivia moved through the room, greeting each guest with genuine warmth.

Their arrival sparked smiles across the room, though not all expressions reflected genuine delight. Victoria Ellington and Miranda Graves stood apart, their stiff postures and guarded expressions setting them apart from the others. When Olivia's gaze landed on Miranda, recognition flashed in her eyes. Miranda was the young woman Olivia had encountered during her visit to the Montgomery estate with Alexander. At the time, Olivia had tried to offer sincere advice, but Miranda remained convinced she'd been deliberately deceived. That unfortunate encounter had left Olivia with reservations about Miranda's character.

Miranda recognized Olivia immediately and instinctively retreated behind Victoria, as if seeking protection. Victoria merely arched a perfectly sculpted eyebrow and struck a pose that radiated superiority, her protective stance toward Miranda speaking volumes about their alliance.

A bright-eyed college student approached Olivia with an enthusiastic greeting. "You must be the brilliant businesswoman everyone's buzzing about online. The media doesn't do your beauty justice. I've been following your negotiations with Sinclair Enterprises - your strategic moves are absolutely masterful."

The young woman had an infectious energy, with rosy cheeks and sparkling eyes that held a childlike wonder. When she smiled, deep dimples appeared, instantly brightening the atmosphere around her.

Flattered by the genuine compliment, Olivia returned the smile. "The media tends to exaggerate. It's lovely to meet you in person."

The girl's eyes widened in surprise. "I didn't expect you to be so down-to-earth! I'm Charlotte Bennett, a sophomore at Crestwood University. I'm here for the incredible learning opportunity. Everyone here is so accomplished - you're barely older than me, yet you've achieved so much!"

Charlotte's enthusiasm bubbled over as she continued showering the group with compliments. Olivia chuckled. "I'm actually quite a bit older than you look. I have a daughter."

"Isabelle, come say hello to everyone." Isabelle approached with a radiant smile, greeting each person with perfect manners.

Victoria, who had maintained a cool distance until now, visibly softened and gently brushed Isabelle's cheek with her fingertips. Miranda, however, remained silent, shrinking further behind Victoria.

Charlotte couldn't contain her excitement as she scooped Isabelle into an enthusiastic hug. "Oh my stars! You're absolutely precious! I've never seen such an adorable little angel. You're simply delightful!"

Completely at ease with the attention, Isabelle giggled in Charlotte's embrace. "When I grow up, I want to be famous like you! I'll light up the entertainment world and be as glamorous as you are."

Charlotte laughed and gently corrected her. "Oh sweetheart, I'm not famous yet! First focus on your studies. I'm at Crestwood University - maybe you'll join me there someday."
###Chapter 525

Olivia's face brightened with maternal pride as Isabelle nodded enthusiastically. The tender moment shattered when a venomous voice sliced through the air. "Must be wonderful having generational wealth. Just waltz into Hollywood like you own it while the rest of us claw our way up from nothing."

The temperature seemed to drop ten degrees as Olivia's head snapped up. Her glacial stare pinned Miranda Graves, who'd been lurking behind Victoria Ellington. Miranda's words dripped with performative martyrdom, her delicate features arranged in practiced victimhood.

Olivia's jaw tightened. Every syllable was being broadcast to millions. Isabelle's innocent comment about wanting to act had been twisted into some nefarious plot. Miranda's implication was clear - the Sinclairs were buying their way into the industry at others' expense.

The live chat exploded with Miranda's sycophants:

"Queen Miranda speaking truth to power!"

"Another trust fund baby stealing opportunities from real talent."

"At least Miranda earned her success through actual skill."

"That poor child doesn't stand a chance with that mother."

"Notice how Miranda's the only one brave enough to call out privilege?"

"Everyone knows Miranda's the most authentic person in Hollywood."

The barrage of comments flashed across the massive studio screens. Isabelle's lower lip trembled as she absorbed the sudden hostility. Though young, she understood enough to know people were being cruel about her mother.

Charlotte Bennett moved closer, murmuring, "She's just a little girl. This is completely unnecessary."

Miranda stepped forward with theatrical solemnity. "Children's words reflect their upbringing. We must hold parents accountable." Her gaze slid to Olivia, heavy with manufactured concern. "Ms. Sinclair, I say this as someone who cares - filling a child's head with dreams of fame is irresponsible. There appear to be... concerning gaps in her moral education."

Isabelle's small hands balled into fists. Without warning, she gave Miranda's leg a light push. "Don't talk about Mommy like that!"

The contact was barely noticeable, yet Miranda collapsed like she'd been struck by a truck. She landed in an undignified heap, knees scraping the floor as she cried out in exaggerated pain. Crew members rushed forward in a flurry of manufactured concern.

The studio erupted into chaos.

Cameras zoomed in on Miranda's "injuries."

Producers whispered frantically into headsets.

And through it all, Olivia stood perfectly still, her expression unreadable as a winter lake.
###Chapter 526

The cameras kept rolling despite the sudden commotion. Victoria Ellington, who stood nearest to Miranda Graves, immediately noticed the disturbance and rushed to assist her. "Miranda, are you hurt? Oh heavens, you're bleeding! Does it pain you terribly?"

Even if Victoria was merely performing for the cameras, her concern appeared utterly genuine. Tears welled in her expressive eyes, a perfect blend of distress and maternal worry that played beautifully on screen.

Online viewers erupted in outrage against Olivia Sinclair and little Isabelle.

"What kind of monster child is this? Miranda was only speaking the truth and trying to protect that brat! Why would she push her like that?"

"I had such high hopes for this show, but that toxic mother-daughter duo is ruining everything. Producers - if you want ratings, get rid of them immediately!"

"Exactly! They're poison. Remove them now before they destroy the entire program!"

"Someone please make that wretched pair leave! I can't bear watching another second of their nonsense."

"Did you see the electric chemistry between Miranda and Victoria though? They're perfectly matched in beauty and screen presence."

Olivia remained silent, her icy gaze locked onto the director. She understood the production needed drama for ratings, but harming Isabelle crossed every line. From the crew's vantage point, it was painfully obvious Miranda had staged her fall.

The director cleared his throat awkwardly. "This was clearly an accident. Miranda slipped on a loose stone. We all witnessed it. How could a four-year-old possibly possess that kind of strength?" Miranda hadn't anticipated the crew defending Olivia. A flicker of guilt crossed her features before she schooled them into perfect wounded innocence. With assistance from the surrounding crowd, she rose gracefully, catching the director's subtle warning glance.

Turning toward the cameras, Miranda adopted a martyr's expression. "It was simply an unfortunate accident. Please don't blame Miss Sinclair or her precious daughter. I brought this upon myself through my own carelessness." As she spoke, Miranda shot Olivia a sideways glance that was anything but innocent.

The actress pretended to be diffusing tension, but her carefully chosen words subtly implied Olivia had bullied her. Olivia merely watched the performance with amusement. She hadn't revealed what transpired at the last gala because the timing wasn't right.

Olivia's original plan had been simple - a relaxing outing with Isabelle while casually getting closer to Victoria. She hadn't accounted for Miranda's relentless provocations.

The veiled hostility in Miranda's gaze didn't escape Olivia's notice. A cold smile curved her lips while her eyes remained glacial. This time, Miranda's fear was unmistakably genuine as she shrank from Olivia's arctic stare. Though some audience members continued grumbling, the immediate outrage had subsided after Miranda's "gracious" explanation.

The production team had discreetly pulled Miranda aside earlier, reminding her that Olivia had invested substantial capital into the program. Crossing the Sinclair heiress would be unwise. Miranda's agent had reinforced this, pointing out that the exposure from this show could land her lucrative endorsement deals. Sinclair Enterprises, though newly prominent, maintained close ties with the powerful Montgomery Group and possessed formidable marketing resources. Securing a Sinclair endorsement could catapult Miranda's career to new heights. Clenching her jaw, Miranda swallowed her pride - for now. The game wasn't over yet.
###Chapter 527

Miranda Graves shot a venomous glare at Olivia and Isabelle, her hostility palpable. The memory of humiliating herself at the Kensington manor still burned fresh, and she blamed Olivia entirely. Behind Olivia's elegant facade, Miranda saw nothing but a cunning manipulator.

Strangely enough, Miranda had formed an instant connection with Victoria Ellington despite their recent acquaintance. With Victoria's influence, Miranda was certain stardom was within reach. Once she achieved fame, the exclusive circles of Crestwood would finally open their doors to her. Her beauty alone guaranteed that much.

As the production crew lightened the mood, tensions gradually eased. Miranda even attempted polite conversation with Isabelle. Olivia realized provoking Miranda had been unwise. Though her dislike remained, she maintained a perfect smile.

Charlotte Bennett leaned closer to Olivia, whispering, "Miss Kensington, there seems to be some history between you and Miranda. Did something happen between you two?"

Olivia responded with an enigmatic smile. "You're quite observant."

Charlotte's eyes sparkled with pride. "I studied psychology at university. These things are obvious to me. Even initial dislike wouldn't explain such intensity. There's clearly more to this story. How did you cross her? She might not be A-list yet, but rumors say she's connected to a powerful Crestwood magnate."

Olivia's interest immediately sharpened. "A Crestwood magnate? Who?" Aside from Liam Blackwood in the past, she couldn't imagine anyone else fitting that description.

Charlotte shook her head helplessly. "No idea. People like us would never have access to that information."

Olivia nodded thoughtfully. Now she understood Miranda's boldness - someone influential was pulling strings behind the scenes. The mystery only deepened her curiosity. Who was this shadowy benefactor supporting Miranda?

Following the earlier confrontation, Olivia and Isabelle had to stay with the production team. As they traveled through the countryside, both marveled at the breathtaking landscapes. The serene scenery lifted everyone's spirits, especially Isabelle's.

Though young and excitable, Isabelle managed to temper her enthusiasm. Charlotte took an immediate liking to the girl, engaging in playful banter. Isabelle's charm worked like magic, brightening the atmosphere. Even the audience comments reflected this shift.

"This little angel is absolutely precious. I just want to squeeze those rosy cheeks!"

"Careful, she might bite. That firecracker is probably just acting sweet for the cameras."

"Why so cruel to a child? The director already clarified everything. Miranda admitted she slipped on a rock. No need for such venom toward a little girl."

"Can we just appreciate the gorgeous scenery? All the guests are stunning anyway."

After the long journey, Isabelle had fallen asleep in Charlotte's arms. Olivia moved to take her, but Charlotte gently refused, having grown quite attached to the sleeping child.
###Chapter 528

The photographer quickly captured several shots of Isabelle sleeping peacefully, her delicate features illuminated by the soft lighting. Viewers watching the live stream collectively cooed at the angelic sight.

Within the hour, their vehicle pulled up to a weathered three-story building. The production team had clearly gone all out for authenticity - the structure appeared decades old with peeling paint and grime-covered windows. Only three bedrooms were available: two singles and one double.

Everyone secretly coveted the private rooms. Charlotte Bennett, ever the gracious one, immediately volunteered for the shared space. "Would anyone like to room with me?" she asked with a warm smile.

The online comments exploded with praise:
"What an absolute sweetheart! Her kindness just radiates through the screen."
"I attend Westfield University with Charlotte. She's a psychology major and consistently ranks top of our class - brilliant and beautiful!"

Miranda Graves' expression soured watching Charlotte steal the spotlight. Clearing her throat dramatically, Miranda stepped forward. "I propose we draw lots for complete fairness. Consistency matters in group dynamics. Making exceptions now will only cause problems later." She gave Charlotte a patronizing look. "I appreciate your good intentions, but you clearly lack experience in these situations. Don't worry, we'll guide you."

Charlotte's smile faltered momentarily at Miranda's condescending tone before she regained her composure. The realization struck her sharply - while Miranda didn't have many fans, her small following was rabidly devoted. As a mere college student, Charlotte had no desire to provoke their wrath.

As expected, the audience praised Miranda's "impartial" suggestion. Basking in the attention, Miranda turned to Victoria Ellington with a simpering smile. "Victoria, what do you think of my idea?"

Victoria reached out to affectionately ruffle Miranda's hair. "Perfect solution." Miranda practically glowed at the praise.

The live chat went wild. Victoria's star power naturally drew attention, and her apparent favoritism toward Miranda made viewers curious about the lesser-known actress. This exposure would undoubtedly boost Miranda's profile.

Olivia Sinclair observed the interaction with growing confusion. According to her team's research, Victoria and Miranda had never met before this show. Why would an A-lister like Victoria, who famously stood up to Donovan Kensington, suddenly cozy up to a nobody like Miranda? There had to be more to this story.

The room assignments were announced swiftly: Olivia would share the double with Miranda, while Charlotte and Victoria each got private rooms.

A shadow crossed everyone's faces at the results. Miranda bit her lip, eyes suddenly glistening with unshed tears. Her push for "fairness" had been purely for show - the thought of being trapped with Olivia was unbearable.
###Chapter 529

If it were just herself, Olivia wouldn't have minded this arrangement. But she had to think of Isabelle. What if Miranda tried something? Olivia's protective instincts flared as she debated asking Liam to take Isabelle somewhere safer.

In an unexpected gesture, Miranda approached Olivia, her smile strained as she spoke through clenched teeth. "Miss Kensington, let's try to coexist civilly," Miranda said, her voice dripping with false sweetness. "I know you're not thrilled about rooming with me either, but we're stuck together for this week. Let's forget past misunderstandings. I'm willing to let bygones be bygones, provided you and your daughter don't cause any disturbances."

Olivia's grip tightened around Isabelle's small hand. Miranda's words, masquerading as peace offerings, only made her more wary. Was Miranda implying they were the troublemakers here? Hadn't Miranda been the one harassing them first?

Murmurs of admiration for Miranda's supposed generosity rippled through the gathered crowd.

"Honestly, I've never seen anyone as forgiving as Miranda. She's practically a saint."

"True. But I worry for her. That mother-daughter pair might try something when the cameras aren't rolling."

"Don't be ridiculous! The production team wouldn't allow that."

"You're so naive! Olivia paid a fortune to get on this show. She wasn't even on the original roster. Makes you wonder what strings she pulled."

Olivia felt the sting of their words but remained silent. She'd only joined the program for Isabelle's sake. Forcing a smile, she reached for Miranda's hand, though her eyes remained guarded. "Why would we cause trouble? Isabelle and I despise drama. There are two beds - you're welcome to the larger one. If it makes you more comfortable, I'll even hang a divider between us. And if children bother you, I'll ensure Isabelle stays out of your way."

Miranda blinked in surprise at Olivia's sudden graciousness. "Oh no, you should take the bigger bed with your daughter. That's only proper."

Olivia countered immediately, "If I did that, people might claim we forced you into the smaller bed. Then we'd never hear the end of it."

Her blunt statement created an awkward silence. Miranda's eyes welled with sudden tears. "Miss Kensington, you can't paint me as the villain here."

Victoria moved to comfort Miranda, shooting Olivia a disapproving look. "Must you be so cruel? Miranda genuinely wants peace."

Olivia's musical laughter cut through the tension. Her striking beauty made everyone else fade into the background. "How dramatic! Miss Graves and I were just playing. I didn't realize she'd take it so seriously. My mistake - I should've known better. Earlier, I saw her joking with Isabelle, pretending to fall and claiming my daughter pushed her. I assumed she enjoyed such playful banter."
###Chapter 530

The atmosphere among the spectators turned icy. Olivia's carefully worded remarks about Miranda carried an undercurrent of hostility beneath their polite surface, making everyone uncomfortable.

Online opinions split sharply.

"Olivia was just being playful. Miranda's overreacting again. She's cried twice already during this show. It's getting tiresome."

"Exactly! This is a variety show, not a therapy session. No one's attacking her, yet she keeps breaking down."

"Are you blind? Olivia's sarcasm was dripping. Her daughter wronged Miranda, and even after Miranda extended an olive branch, she gets mocked. Anyone would feel hurt in her position."

The digital battlefield reignited. As Olivia meticulously adjusted the fabric divider between their beds, she casually suggested, "Perhaps we should install surveillance in the room. For Miss Prescott's safety, of course. If anything happens, we'll have evidence to protect the innocent." She lingered pointedly on the word "innocent."

Previously, Miranda had tried framing Isabelle. Now Olivia was countering. After the commotion settled, Olivia guided Isabelle back to their shared space. The new curtain created a clean partition, their modest bed nestled by the window. Though cramped, it provided enough room for mother and daughter.

Regret gnawed at Olivia. Had she known this would distress Isabelle, she never would have brought her along. Her thoughts scattered when the door hinges squeaked.

Victoria and Miranda entered quietly. Miranda's sniffles and puffy eyes betrayed her recent breakdown. Victoria murmured soothing words, her voice calm yet strained.

Miranda suddenly clutched Victoria's wrist, her voice trembling. "Victoria, please don't go. Stay with me a little longer."

Victoria exhaled heavily. "Miranda, I need to unpack. I promise I'll come back after, alright?"

Miranda didn't answer, her watery gaze fixed on the curtain, lips quivering with fresh indignation. "The producers said they're adding cameras," she muttered. "What will people think when they see this divider?"

Though whispered, Olivia caught every word. Her jaw tightened. She'd installed the curtain precisely because of Miranda's dramatics. Any incident would inevitably become Olivia's fault in Miranda's narrative.

Isabelle stirred beside her, groaning. "Mommy, the noise! I can't sleep!" Miranda's weeping, though subdued, carried an irritating shrillness - like a persistent mosquito in the night.

Before Olivia could respond, Miranda's sobs escalated dramatically. Then came the sound of hurried footsteps rushing down the corridor toward them.
