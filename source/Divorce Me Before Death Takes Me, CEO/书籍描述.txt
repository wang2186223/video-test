"I'm sorry, Mrs. Parker. We couldn't save the baby." My hand instinctively reached for my stomach. "So... it's really gone?" "Your cancer-weakened body can't support the pregnancy. We need to end it, soon," the doctor says. After the surgery, HE showed up. "Audrey Sinclair! How dare you make this decision without consulting me?" I wanted to pour out my pain, to feel his embrace. But when I saw the WOMAN beside him, I gave up. Without hesitation, he left with that "fragile" woman. That kind of tenderness, I’ve never felt it. However, I don't mind that anymore as I have nothing now - my child, my love, and even... my life. *** Audrey Sinclair, a poor woman, fell in love with a man she shouldn't have. Blake Parker, New York's most powerful billionaire, has everything a man could dream of - money, power, influence - but one thing: he doesn't love her. Five years of one-sided love. Three years of secret marriage. A diagnosis that leaves her with three months to live. When the Hollywood starlet returns from Europe, Audrey Sinclair knows it's time to end her loveless marriage. But she doesn't understand - since he doesn't love her, why did he refuse when she proposed divorce? Why is he torturing her during these last three months of her life? As time slips away like sand through an hourglass, Audrey must choose: die as Mrs. Parker, or live her final days in freedom.
