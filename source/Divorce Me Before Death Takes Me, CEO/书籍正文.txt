###Chapter 1: What Is Left To Hold Onto?
Audrey's POV
The sterile white walls of the Mayo Clinic seemed colder than usual today. Or perhaps the chill was within me. I sat in Dr. Evans' office, my thumb hovering over the screen of my phone. The headline on Page Six was a jagged glass shard in my heart: "Hollywood Starlet Laurel Rose Makes Surprise Return; Greeted by NYC's Most Eligible Bachelor."
"Most eligible bachelor," I whispered, a hollow laugh escaping my lips. The world had no idea that Blake Parker—New York's golden boy and the ruthless CEO of the Parker Group—had been bound to me in marriage for three years. I was the secret wife, the shadow in his public success. The photos showed him at the airport, wearing a smile I hadn't seen in years.
Three months. That was the expiration date Dr. Evans had placed on my life. And now, this.
"Mrs. Parker?" Dr. Evans' voice was gentle. She only used my married name when we were behind closed doors. To the public, I was Audrey Sinclair, the "country girl" foundling of the Sinclair fortune. My marriage was a ghost story.
I looked up, already sensing the weight of her words.
"I'm sorry, Audrey. Given your condition and how much your body has weakened... we couldn't save the pregnancy."
My hand instinctively moved to my stomach. It felt impossibly empty. "So, it’s over?"
"Your health is the priority now," she said, choosing her words with clinical care. "We need to proceed with the procedure immediately to prevent further complications."
I nodded, surprised by my own stillness. Perhaps after three years of loving a man who viewed me as a mere obligation, I had finally run out of tears.
"Can we do it now?" I asked. "And please... I don't want anything to dull the clarity of this moment. I need to remember exactly how this feels."
The walk to the surgical wing felt like a funeral procession. In the hallways, I heard the whispers of the staff.
"Did you see the news? Blake Parker and Laurel Rose... back together after three years. It’s like a fairy tale."
A fairy tale, I thought bitterly. What do you call the woman who sat by his hospital bed for months when he was in a coma? What do you call the wife who endured his family’s disdain just to keep his world from falling apart? Pathetic. That was the word they’d use if they knew the truth.
The procedure was a blur of cold instruments and a deep, aching void. I had called Blake five times that morning. Five chances for him to be the man I hoped he was. Five calls that went straight to a silent voicemail.

Thirty minutes later, the door to my recovery room swung open. Blake stood there, impeccable in his charcoal suit, his face a mask of controlled fury.
"Audrey Sinclair! How dare you make a medical decision of this magnitude without informing me?"
"I tried calling you," I said, my voice sounding as though it came from a great distance.
"Liar. My phone has been with me all morning. There isn't a single missed call from you."
"Check your history, Blake."
He pulled out his phone, swiping through it with a sneer before tossing it onto the foot of my bed. "Nothing. Are you so desperate for attention that you’d fabricate a crisis?"
I stared at the empty log. I knew Laurel was clever, but I hadn't realized she had already regained total control over his life.
"Maybe it's for the best," I said, my voice devoid of emotion. "This marriage was built on a foundation of silence. Why should our ending be any different?"
Blake’s eyes darkened, stepping closer until his shadow enveloped me. "You think you can just—"
"Oh... Blake... my head..."
The soft moan from the doorway cut through his anger. Laurel Rose stood there, draped in a delicate white dress that made her look like a fragile porcelain doll. She swayed slightly, her hand pressed to her temple.
"Blake, darling... I feel so dizzy. I think the jet lag is catching up to me."
In an instant, the man who had been ready to tear me apart transformed. The fury in Blake’s eyes vanished, replaced by a raw, frantic concern. He rushed to her side, catching her before she could fall.
"Laurel? What’s wrong? Should I call a specialist?"
"Just... the stress of the day," she whispered, clinging to his arm.
I watched from the bed, a ghost in my own life. Blake supported her waist with a gentleness he had never offered me. He guided her out of the room, his argument with me forgotten as if I had never existed.
Through the window of my room, I watched them disappear down the corridor. The perfect couple. The starlet and the billionaire.
I placed a hand over my abdomen, feeling the cold reality of my situation. My time was running out, and the man I had given everything to didn't even know I was dying.
I checked out of the clinic alone. The Sinclair mansion felt like a tomb when I returned. I barely made it to the bathroom before a wave of nausea and weakness overcame me. My vision blurred, the world tilting on its axis as the physical toll of the day finally claimed its due. As I collapsed onto the floor, my last thought was of the empty call log—and the realization that I truly had nothing left to hold onto.

###Chapter 2: Three Years Is Enough
Audrey's POV
Something soft brushed against my cheek. Snow. My vision slowly cleared, the ceiling of my bathroom coming back into focus. The tiles were bitingly cold against my skin, a stark reminder of the weakness that had claimed me after I returned from the clinic.
Through the window, the afternoon sun cast long, amber shadows across the floor. I must have been out for over an hour. Snow, my cat, meowed softly, headbutting my hand with frantic concern. I tried to push myself up, but my strength hadn't fully returned.
The sharp, rhythmic click of leather shoes echoed from the hallway. Then, a voice—cold, cutting, and entirely devoid of empathy.
"Still trying to elicit sympathy, Audrey?"
I didn't need to look up to know Blake was standing in the doorway. He leaned against the frame, radiating the icy contempt he reserved solely for me.
"I don't have time for these theatrics," he said, walking into the living room and settling onto the sofa with studied grace. "Laurel’s return to the States is a major media event. If rumors about her visit to the clinic start circulating because of you..."
"Is that why you’re here?" I forced myself to stand, clinging to the doorframe for support. A bitter laugh escaped me. "You’ve left your 'precious' friend behind because you’re worried I might tarnish her pristine image?"
"Watch your tone," Blake snapped, his eyes narrowing. "You know exactly what Laurel means to this family’s legacy. Your jealousy is becoming a liability."
I stared at him, my voice steady despite my internal trembling. "If she’s so concerned about her image, perhaps she shouldn't be photographed in places that invite speculation. I am your legal wife, Blake. Yet here you are, demanding I protect the woman who wants my place."
"You used my grandfather's influence to secure this marriage while I was in no position to argue," he spat, his fury dropping the room temperature. "Don't talk to me about legalities when you started this with a manipulation."
A tired smile touched my lips. "You’re right. I was wrong to hold on so tightly back then. I thought devotion mattered. I was mistaken."
I met his gaze, my heart feeling strangely light as the final thread of hope snapped. "Let’s end it. Let’s get a divorce."
Something flickered in his eyes—surprise? Or perhaps just irritation at losing control of the narrative. "What is this? Another tactic to get me to stay?"
"No more tactics," I whispered. "I’m just... tired."
"First the medical procedure without consulting me, now this." He sneered. "Are you going to run to my grandfather next?"
"I’ve never used him as a shield against you," I said firmly. "And I won't start now. Three years of this silence is enough, don't you think?"
Before he could respond, his phone buzzed. The transformation was instantaneous. The iron mask softened into genuine worry as he checked the message.
"She’s not feeling well," he muttered, already heading for the door.
"Of course," I replied quietly.
He paused, glancing at the coffee table where the divorce papers lay. "We’ll discuss this when you’re thinking more clearly."
"There’s nothing left to clarify, Blake."
The door slammed shut, the sound echoing through the empty mansion. I sank onto the sofa, Snow jumping onto my lap as I picked up a pen. With a hand that only shook slightly, I signed my name. Each stroke was a final goodbye to five years of unrequited love.
I dialed a familiar number. "Astrid? It’s me. I’ve signed them."
"Audrey..." Astrid’s voice was soft with concern. "Come to my place. You shouldn't be alone tonight."
"I'm coming. And I'm bringing Snow."

Blake's POV One Week Later, Los Angeles
The Four Seasons ballroom was a sea of glittering jewelry and elite conversation. From the VIP balcony, I watched the crowd, though my mind was miles away. Michael Chen, my assistant, was droning on about third-quarter projections.
"Mr. Parker? Should I continue?" Michael asked, noticing my distraction.
I waved him off, my fingers instinctively scrolling through my messages with Audrey. The last one was from a week ago: Try to drink less coffee today.
Usually, she flooded my phone with updates—reminders to eat, photos of that cat, unnecessary check-ins. It used to irritate me. Now, the silence was deafening. No explanation for the clinic visit, no follow-up on the divorce papers. Just... nothing.
"Any word from the house?" I asked, my voice tight.
"Mrs. Rebecca says Audrey is resting. Everything is quiet," Michael reported.
"Quiet," I repeated. Was this another game? A dramatic disappearing act to make me feel guilty? My cynical mind wanted to believe it, but a small, persistent voice reminded me that in five years, she had never been a liar.
I stood up to overlook the dance floor. The music had shifted to a rhythmic, elegant beat.
"Mr. Parker..." Michael gasped, pointing toward the center of the ballroom. "Is that... is that Mrs. Parker?"
I followed his gaze. In the center of the floor, a woman in a stunning, midnight-blue gown was moving with a grace I hadn't seen in years. She looked vibrant, radiant—and she was dancing with another man.

###Chapter 3: Would You Like to Dance with Me?

**Blake's POV**

"Impossible." The word came automatically. Audrey was supposed to be at home,resting from her *convenient* illness. Besides, she'd never



The thought died as I followed Michael's finger. There, in the center of the dance floor, was my wife.

The dress she wore was a deep, burning red, cut with the precision and elegance that marked the work of Europe's finest couturiers. It hugged her figure in a way that made my throat go dry, the material flowing like liquid fire with each step of the waltz. Her dark hair was styled in elegant waves, framing a face that looked both familiar and foreign.

This wasn't the carefully composed Mrs. Parker who tiptoed around my family's mansion. This was a side of Audrey Sinclair I'd never seen before - confident, radiant, almost defiant.

She was leading her dance partner through the steps with practiced ease. An unknown man in a black suit, his dancing notably less polished than hers. My eyes narrowed at the sight of his hand resting just a bit too low on her back, and the polite smile playing on her lips. I stood up abruptly, and Michael was a bit stunned. "Sir-"

I ignored him, alreadly striding toward the stairs. The burning anger in my chest demanded immediate confrontation.
"Blake,darling!"

The sugary-sweet voice cut through my rising anger like a silk-wrapped knife. Laurel stood at the top of the grand staircase,a vision in white. She glided closer, her smile camera-perfect as always.

"Laurel? What brings you to LA?" I found myself asking,momentarily distracted from my intended confrontation.

"For a photoshoot," she explained, her voice carrying that practiced mix of casualness and charm. "When I heard about tonight's gala with all these jewelry designers and merchants, I simply had to come.I'm looking for some pieces to endorse, you know."

Her eyes sparkled as she glanced toward the dance floor. "And when I saw everyone dancing downstairs... I was just thinking how unfortunate it is not to have the right partner for such a lovely evening."

My eyes drifted back to the dance floor, where Audrey was still moving gracefully with her unknown partner. The sight of her exposed neck as she laughed made my jaw clench.

"Would you like to dance with me?" Laurel's hand touched my arm.

I nodded, more out of habit than desire. "Sure."

As we made our way down, I noticed Audrey had switched partners again - now dancing with a man in a navy suit. James Collins.

Her senior from college, the one who'd helped her a lot and almost won her heart before I came into the picture.
They moved with practiced familiarity, close enough now that I could catch fragments of their conversation.

"...still designing?" Collins was asking.

"Some pieces," Audrey replied, her voice carrying a warmth I hadn't heard in weeks. "Though jewelry design has taken a backseat lately."

"A shame. Your talent was always exceptional."

I pulled Laurel closer, steering us within better hearing range.

"Speaking of exceptional," Laurel's voice carried a hint of irony,"Mrs.Parker seems... different tonight," Laurel observed, her voice carrying a delicate mix of concern and disdain. "Almost like she's celebrating something. Though after what happened at Mayo Clinic last week, I would think she'd show more... dliscretion."

My grip on Laurel's waist tightened involuntarily. The mention of the hospital brought back the image of Audrey's pale face in that stark white room.

"Blake, darling?" Laurel's voice softened with practiced concern."Maybe you should go talk to her."

"She must be upset, seeing us together," Laurel continued, lowering her eyes demurely. "That's probably why she's dancing with all these men. You know... to get your attention."

"There's nothing between us." The words came out like ice, even as my eyes tracked Audrey's movements across the dance floor.
Was this her revenge? Knowing I wouldn't-couldn't-acknowledge her publicly, was she deliberately flaunting herself before me? The thought sent a surge of anger through my chest. The same woman who'd spent three years carefully guarding our secret was now dancing with abandon, drawing every eye in the room.

*Including mine.*

Before I could process that, the music stopped. Theevent MC's voice boomed through the speakers.

"Ladies and gentlemen! It's time for our traditional partner exchange dance! When the spotlight lands on you, please prepare to switch partners with the nearest couple!"

The ballroom lights dimmed. A spotlight began to dance across the floor, slowing as it approached our section. I already knew where it would stop.

Time seemed to freeze as two spotlights locked into place - one on Laurel and me, the other on Audrey and Collins.

I couldn't help but stareat Audrey, In the harsh spotlight, I could see what the distance had hidden - she'd lost weight, enough to make her cheekbones sharper than they should be. There were shadows under her eyes that makeup couldn't quite conceal.

*What happened to you in the past week?*

The thought came unbidden, followed quickly by anger. What right did I have to worry about her when she was here, dancing with *him*, wearing *that* dress, smiling like she hadn't just walked away from

The MC's voice cut through my thoughts: "Couples in the spotlight,please prepare to exchange partners!"

I watched as Collins released Audrey's waist, saw her take a deep breath as she turned toward me.

For a moment, just a moment, her mask slipped. Our eyes met.
###Chapter 4: When Will You Sign Them?

**Audrey's POV**

I stood before the ornate double doors of the hotel, feeling Astrid's approving gaze on my red dress. The silk fabric whispered against my skin with each breath, its deep crimson a far cry from the conservative designer pieces I used to wear as Mrs. Parker.

"See?" Astrid's voice held a note of triumph. "I always said you were made for these bold, sexy looks. You used to be so concerned about the proper Parker wife'image, always wearing those conservative designer pieces..." She adjusted the strap of my dress with a satisfied smile. "They never suited you!"

I met her eyes. "I won't make that mistake again."

The words came out stronger than I expected, carrying the weight of my decision. Three years of trying to fit into the Parker family mold,of dulling my own light to avoid outshining others - it felt like shedding an ill-fitting skin.

"Ready?" Astrid squeezed my hand.

I took a deep breath, feeling the fabric shift across mny exposed back."As I'll ever be."

The doors opened, and we stepped into the sea of designer evening wear and polite society laughter. The annual LA Jewelry Guild gala was in full swing, with the wwho's who of the industry mingling under the warm lighting. I felt the subtle shift in attention as we entered- the pause in conversations, the sideways glances, the
whispered speculations about the woman in red who dared to stand out.

*Let them look," I thought.*Let them wonder.*

I'd just finished a waltz with a visiting Swiss watchmaker when a familiar voice caught me off guard.

"Audrey?"

I turned to find James Collins watching me with a mix of surprise and appreciation. He looked exactly as I remembered from our Parsons days -tall, elegant, with that gentle intelligence in his eyes that had once made my heart skip a beat.

"James!" The smile that spread across my face was genuine. "I didn't expect to see you here."

He gestured at the dance floor with an easy grace. "Since we've met here,shall we? We can catch up while we dance."

I placed my hand in his, feeling the familiar comfort of an old friend."I'd love to."

"You're still designing?" he asked as we moved across the floor.

"Some pieces," I replied, surprised by the warmth in my own voice."Though jewelry design has taken a backseat lately."

"A shame. Youir talent was always exceptional."

The music swelled around us, and for a moment, I let myself remember simpler times. Design classes at Parsons, coffee breaks
between lectures, James's patient guidance when I struggled with technical drawings. Before I became Mrs. Parker. Before I learned what it meant to love someone who would never love me back.

A sudden hush fell over the ballroom as the lights dimmed after the MC's announcement. A spotlight began its lazy sweep across the dance floor, and James chuckled as it slowed near us.

"The lighting director must have it but for me tonight."

"James," I said softly, watching the second spotlight find its target across the room, "looks like fate has other plans."

The air seemed to crystallize as I saw them - Blake and Laurel,caught in the same spotlight as us. He looked impeccable as always in his designer tuxedo, while she was a vision in white, clinging to his arm with practiced delicacy.

"Audrey?" James's voice seemed to come from far away. "Are you alright?"

I forced my lips into a smile, even as my chest tightened."Of course.It's just... interesting timing."

The MC's cheerful voice boomed through the speakers: "Couples in the spotlight, please prepare to exchange partners!"

As James released my waist, I took a deep breath, turning toward my husband. *Soon to be ex-husband,* I reminded myself. On his face, 1caught a flash of something dark and possessive that I once would have mistaken for care.
*Not anymore.*

Blake's hand was cold when it closed around mine. His other hand settled on my waist, pulling me closer than strictly necessary for a waltz.

"Good evening," I said politely, maintaining the precise distance required by proper dance form.

His laugh held no warmth. "So formal? You seemed much more...intimate with your previous partners."

"Did I?" I kept my voice light, even as his fingers dug into my waist."I hadn't noticed."

His expression darkened, a muscle twitching in his jaw. "Playing coy doesn't suit you, Audrey Sinclair."

"And playing the concerned husband doesn't suit you, Blake Parker."

We moved across the floor in perfect sync. From the ouItside,we probably looked like any other elegant couple.

"Where did you learn to dance like this?" he asked suddenly. "I don't recall country girls taking ballroom lessons."

I gave a fake smile. "There are still many things about me that you don't know,Mr.Parker."

His jaw tightened. I could feel the tension radiating through his arm where it pressed against my back. " Audrey. Since when have you become so sharp-tongued? Remember, you're still my wife!"
"Wife?" I met his gaze steadily. "When was the last time you came home,Blake? You better go check what's waiting on your office desk."

A hint of surprise flashed in his eyes, perhaps, at this new version of me who dared to push back. "What's that? What do you..."

"The divorce papers, Blake. They've been there for a week. Tell me-when will you sign them?"

The question landed betwveen us like a stone in still water. His steps faltered for a fraction of a second.

"What are you talking about?"

"You'll understand when you see them, Mr. Parker." I stepped back as the music ended, breaking his hold. "I hope our next meeting will be at the lawyers' office to finalize the divorce."

"Audrey..." He reached for my arm, but I was already turning away.


"Goodbye,Blake."

I walked away without looking back, feeling lighter with each sep.The red dress moved like liquid fire around me, and for the first time in five years, I felt truly, completely free.

Behind me, I could hear Laurel's practiced breathless voice: "Blake,darling!" There was a flutter of white silk as she practically fled from James, dramatically falling into Blake's arms. "Your dancing is so much better! That gentleman..." She cast a pointed look in James's direction, her voice dropping to a deliberately audible whisper,"He was so rough, stepped on my toes several times!"
I caught James's barely concealed eye roll as he approached me,smoothly removing his navy suit jacket. Without a word, he draped it over my shoulders. The familiar scent brought back memories of simpler days at school when dreams still seemed possible and love wasn't a battlefield.

"Ready to go?" he asked softly, his eyes full of concern.

I nodded, pulling his jacket closer. The night air would be cool, and P d left my wrap in Astrid's car. "Thank you, James."

We walked towards the gate without casting a single glance back.
###Chapter 5: She Left Without Goodbye?

**Blake's POV**

She didn't look back. Not even once. The woman in red who'd just walked away with a confidence I'd never seen in my wife of three years. This wasn't the Mrs. Parker in my memory. This was someone else entirely - someone who'd learned to stand straight without seeking my approval.

*When will you sign them?*

Her words echoed in my mind, sharp as broken glass. The divorce papers. Of course, she would pull something like this - another one of her manipulative games.

I started after her, but Laurel pressed herself against my chest. "Your dancing is so much better! That gentleman... he was so rough,stepped on my toes several times!"

"Not now, Laurel." My eyes remained fixed on Audrey's retreating form. The sight of James Collins draping his navy suit jacket over her shoulders made a fierce surge of possessive jealousy churn in my chest. The same feeling I'd gotten watching her dance with every other man in the room tonight.

"Blake." Laurel caught my arm, her eyes fixed on Audrey's retreating figure. "What's wrong?"

She tilted her head with practiced concern. "Did Mrs. Parker upset you?"
"Laurel." I shook off her grip with barely concealed irritation. "I have something to handle. Enjoy yourself at the gala."

Without waiting for her response. I strode toward the exit where Audrey had disappeared. Three steps forward-and then the sound of shattering crystal glasses froze the entire ballroom.

I turned to find Laurel sprawled beside the collapsed champagne tower, her white dress now stained with spilled champagne, one hand clutched to her chest in apparent distress. A thin line of red was blooming across her palm where a broken champagne glass had cut her

"I'm so sorry," she whimpered, eyes wide with calculated fear. "I just felt so dizzy suddenly..."

Her eyes filled with tears. "The champagne tower... all those glasses..Blake, I've ruined everything!"

"Let me see." I caught her hand, examining the cut. It wasn't deep.but blood was already staining the pristine white of her dress. "We need to get this looked at."

"No, no..." She tried to pull away, "If you want to go after Audrey,you should.I'll be fine."

"Don't be ridiculous. You need medical attention."

"But after everything I did..." Her voice caught. "Five years ago,saving you when you were blind... I never asked for anything in return. And now I'm just causing trouble..."
My grip on her hand tightened. "Stop. You know I'll always be grateful for what you did back then." The words came automnatically,practiced. "Let's get you to a doctor."

I held her and left the gala.

As I approached the entrance, I caught sight of Audrey again. She was standing with James near the entrance, speaking to a group of senior jewelry designers. I caught fragments of their conversation.James was introducing Audrey to those designers.

"This is my junior from Parsons," he was saying, gesturing to Audrey."She's an exceptionally talented designer."

Audrey stood slightly behind him, a genuine smile gracing her features as she greeted the industry veterans. "Hello, I...”

The sight of her comfortable familiarity with James ignited something dark inside me. Before I realized what I was doing, my shoulder slammed into hers as we passed. Audrey stumbled, nearly falling, but James's hand shot out instantly, steadying her by the shoulder.

She turned after regaining her balance, pain flickering across her face as she realized who had bumped into her. Our eyes met for a brief moment-me still holding Laurel, her steadied by James's protective grip.

My gaze fixed on his hand resting on her shoulder, and I felt my jaw clench involuntarily.

"Audrey Sinclair." My voice cut through their conversation like ice."
You have three hours to explain tonight's little performance. Or have
you forgotten who you are?"

Her eyes met mine, calm and distant. No trace of the woman who'd spent five years trying to please me. "I know exactly who I am, Mr.Parker. That's why I left those papers on your desk."

"Blake..." Laurel's pained whisper pulled at my attention. "It hurts..."

A hint of sorrow flashed on Audrey's face -before she turned back to those designers. "Shall we continue our discussion somewhere quieter?



The hospital's VIP wing was eerily quiet at this hour. I stood in the corridor,watching through the glass as the doctor finished examining Laurel's hand. The cut had been minor- no nerve damage, wouldn't even leave a scar. But she'd worked herself into such a state about potential scarring affecting her career that they'd given her a mild sedative.

"Mr. Parker?" Michael's voice was hesitant. I turned to find my assistant hovering nearby, tablet in hand. "About Mrs. Parker..."

"Where is she?" The words came out sharper than intended. "It's been over three hours."


Michael swallowed hard. "Sir... Mrs. Paker is already on a flight back to New York."


Those words rendered me motionless, my mind going blank. "What did you say?"

"She left directly from the gala." He wouldn't meet my eyes. "Her
flight departed about an hour ago."

My temples throbbed with barely contained rage. "And you're just telling me this now?"

"I... I tried calling her, but Mrs. Parker had disconnected all her contact methods and deactivated every device provided by the Parker family."

*How's that possible?* Audrey had never done this in three years.Even when we fought, even during my longest silences, she'd kept the number. Always available, always waiting.

"Sir?" Michael's voice seemed to come from far away. "Should I arrange for security to...”

"No, Michael." I cut him off, already striding toward the exit."Handle things with Laurel. I need to go back to New York, right now!11


The Lunar mansion was dark when I arrived. No lights in the windows, no warm glow from the kitchen where Audrey usually waited up with her damn cat and her endless cups of tea. The security system beeped its recognition as I entered, the sound echoing through empty rooms.

Something felt wrong. Off. The house was exactly as it always was,and yet...

There was no longer Audrey's bustling figure.

In the bathroom, her toiletries had vanished. No fancy French creams,
no elaborate skincare routine laid out precisely as she liked it. Just empty marble countertops reflecting the harsh overhead lights.

Back in the living room, I noticed more absences. The throw blanket she always curled up with while reading. The collection of poetry books on the coffee table. That ridiculous cat bed by the window where Snow spent his days watching birds.

The divorce papers sat in the center of my desk, exactly where she said they'd be. Her signature was neat and decisive at the bottom of the divorce papers. The date at the top caught my eye - one week ago.
###Chapter 6: Abandoned Without Mercy

**Blake's POV**

My heart skipped for an instant.

For the past week, my mother had assuired me daily that Audrey was fine,resting at the mansion, just sulking after our argumnent.I'd actually believed her, assumed Audrey's silence was just another of her moods. No messages, no calls, no constant fussing about my schedule - I'd thought she was just being petulant.

But my mother had been lying. All this time.

Audrey hadn't been here at all. She'd left these papers and walked away.

My grip on my phone tightened until my knuckles turned white.Where would she even go? Having been switched at birth and raised in the countryside, her relationship with her birth family, the Sinclairs,had always been strained. She'd never once visited them in our three years of marriage.

Things three years ago flashed in my mind. *She wouldn't really leave.* The thought surfaced with familiar certainty. *She knows her place in the Parker family is entirely dependent on this marriage.* I let out a cold laugh, finding my previous thought ridiculous.

But at this hour, where could she possibly be?

Unless.,. had she gone to James Collins? The way they'd danced together at the gala, the familiarity in their interaction... Of course,
her perfect college senior would welcome her with open arms.

The anger building in my chest threatened to explode. My mother's lies, Audrey's disappearance, those divqrce papers - it was alI too much. I grabbed my phone, dialing Michael's number with more force than necessary. He answered on the first ring, as always.

"Find out where Audrey Sinclair is. Immediately."

"Sir, I've investigated." Michael's usually composed voice held a note of apprehension. "But I can only trace her return flight to New York...I can't pinpoint her exact location."

I couldn't hold the anger in my voice. "That's impossible. Don't sleep until you find her. If you don't have information by morning, submit your resignation to HR."

I ended the call, the silence of the mansion suddenly oppressive.Upstairs, I needed to see our rooms.

The master suite was exactly as I remembered it - and completely different. Everything was in its place, from the Italian silk curtains to the crystal vases, but the space felt hollow. Empty in a way that had nothing to do with furniture.

I opened the walk-in closet. Rows of designer dresses still hung perfectly pressed, each one selected and purchased to meet the exacting standards of a Parker wife. But the small section of casual wear was conspicuously bare. A few empty hangers where her favorite sweaters should have been. The antique jewelry box on her vanity, untouched for what looked like weeks, fine dust dulling its
silver surface.

My fingers traced the edge of the box, remembering how she used to carefully arrange each piece I gave her. The diamond earrings from our first Christmas. The sapphire necklace that matched her eyes,presented on her birthday. The pearl set she wore to every Parker family function, trying so hard to fit in.

All abandoned. Like perfectly arranged museum pieces, preserved but lifeless.

Staring at these abandoned treasures, something unfamiliar twisted in my chest. A hollowness I'd never experienced before.

In that moment, a realization hit me: I was just like these discarded luxuries. Things Audrey had once cherished, now left behind without a backward glance. Objects that had lost their meaning to her,abandoned without mercy.

I found myself standing in front of her vanity mirror, staring at the reflection of our bed. How many nights had I come home late to find her curled up there, pretending to be asleep but waiting up anyway?

The bed looked wrong without her novel on the nightstand, without that hideous hand-knitted throw she insisted on keeping. Perfect and cold, like a hotel suite. Like somewhere you stay,not somewhere you live.


*When did she stop living here?* The thought came unbidden.*When did she start planning this exit?*

My phone buzzed - another message from Laurel about her "injury"
from the gala. I ignored it, sinking onto the edge of the bed.

The night stretched endlessly, sleep impossible in this museum of abandoned gifts and hollow luxury.

Dawn was breaking when Michael called again.

"Mr. Parker, I've located Mrs. Parker."

I sat up immediately, stiff from hours of restless waiting. "Where is she?"

"She's... she's at Mayo Clinic."

I was stunned. Mayo Clinic - the premier medical facility in New York,known for handling the most serious cases. Specialists in cancer and critical conditions.

"Mayo Clinic? What's she doing there?"

"Through special channels, I accessed her admission records." Michael's hesitation was palpable. "They show... Mrs. Parker was admitted overnight for a minor cut, concerned about potential infection."

A laugh escaped me, harsh and bitter. "Acut warrants admission to the most prestigious hospital in New York? She's clearly trying to make me think she's seriously ill."

But even as the words left my mouth, something cold settled in my chest. Mayo Clínic didn't admit people for minor cuts, no matter how wealthy they were. And Audrey had never been one for dramatic gestures or manipulation.
"Get me her room number," I ordered.

"Of course, sir. Ill have it ready by the time you arrive at Mayo Clinic.11


I stood to leave, but something made me pause. Opening the bottom drawer of my desk, I reached for a small jewelry box tucked away in the far corner. Inside lay the ten-carat diamond ring -our wedding ring. *Her* wedding ring.

She used to treat this ring like a treasure, taking it out periodically just to wear it and take photos. Then she'd carefully,almost reverently, put it back in its box.

Looking at the ring now, I couldn't help but remember her face, eyes filled with pure joy every time she wore it.

With sudden irrtation, I snapped the box shut and shoved it into my pocket with those papers before striding out of the room.

*What on earth do you want, Audrey Sinclair?* For the first time in our marriage, I wasn't entirely sure what she wanted to do.

Minutes later, I stood outside the 2306 room at Mayo Clinic. The jewelry box felt heavy in my handas I prepared to confront her. But voices from inside made me pause.

Astrid was there, and I suddenly wanted to hear their conversation.

I put the box back into my pocket. Leaning closer to the door, I caught a familiar voice. "Maybe I should have chosen James."

###Chapter 7:Maybe I Should Have Chosen Ja mes

**Audrey's POV**

Mayo Clinic's VIP wing was quiet the next morning, and the early glow of dawn stretched long shadows across the pristine floor. I lay in the hospital bed, trying not to think about the experimental drug coursing through my veins, when the image of Blake tenderly holding Laurel in his arms last night popped into my mind.

His gentleness with her was everything it had never been with me.Five years of wondering if he was capable of such tenderness, and now I knew the truth - he just never chose to be gentle with me.

I remembered standing there, James's navy jacket still warm around my shoulders, as I almost forgot the pain brought by Blake's impact while seeing his retreating figure.

I ignored curious whispers from passing guests filled the air and shared opinions with the group of senior jewelry designers.

After that, I received a call from Dr. Evans. The urgency in her voice,the promise of an experimental treatment... I still remembered gripping the column for support as I listened. And that was why I managed to end up here so hurriedly.

My thoughts were interrupted as Astrid burst into the room with her usual dramatic flair.

"Breakfast delivery!" She held up a paper bag from my favorite café."
And don't you dare say you're not hungry."

"You didn't have to..."

"Of course I had to." She pulled up achair,her expression turning serious. "Now, want to explain why you rushed back from LA in the middle of the night forsome experimental treatment?"

I picked at the croissant she'd brought, avoiding her eyes. "The timing was crucial. It's a new drug for repairing post-miscarriage uterine damage. Very limited supply, so I couldn't wait."

"Uh-huh." She wasn't buying it. "And it had nothing to do with a certain CEO and his Hollywood princess?"

"Of course not," I smiled, deliberately changing the subject. "Did you bring Snow back with you?"

Astrid sighed. "Yes, I tell you, she kept looking around everywhere for you. By the way, you got back pretty late last night... Must have been hard to get a flight on such short notice?"

"Mm."

I smiled faintly. "James contacted his friends at the airline. That's how I managed to get a last-minute ticket."

"James really cares about you, you know," Astrid said softly. "He messaged me first thing this morning, asking me to take good care of you. Remember how he used to help you with all those technical drawings at Parsons? Always staying late in the studio, bringing you coffee..."
I smiled despite myself. "He was just being nice."

"Nice?" Astrid snorted. "Honey, that man was head over heels for you.Still is, if you ask me." She paused, watching me carefully. "You know, if you hadn't met Blake, you might already be with James.Feeling regretful now?"

The words hit harder than I expected. Would I be here now, dying in a hospital bed, if I'd chosen differently? Would James have treated me the way Blake did?

I took a small bite of my croissant, my voice oddly detached. "Yes.Very regretful. Maybe I should have chosen James."

If I hadn't stubbornly married Blake, hadn't exhausted myself taking care of him, hadn't clung to this hopeless marriage for three whole years...

"It's not too late to regret now,you know."

Completely unaware of how little time I had left, Astrid smiled encouragingly. "You still have a long life ahead of you. There are endless possibilities with James."

I fought back the bitterness rising in my throat. "James is wonderful,it's just that he and I..,”

The door suddenly slammed open.

Blake stood in the doorway, his expression thunderous. How long had he been listening?
"So this is why you want a divorce?" His voice cut through the room like ice. "To run back to your college sweetheart?"

Astrid was on her feet instantly. "How dare you barge in here...”

"Stay out of this!" Blake's eyes never left my face. "Tell me, Audrey.Since James is so wonderful, why did you marry me?"

"Are you out of your mind?" Astrid was quite furious. "That's rich,coming from youa. When you were in that coma, which woman in her right mind would have given you the time of day? Hell, even Laurel hightailed it to Europe on an overnight flight! If it hadn't been for Audrey's unwavering devotion and care, you'd still be a living corpse lying in a hospital bed!"

Blake narrowed his eyes. "I acknowledge what she did for me during my coma. Otherwise, I wouldn't have let her keep the title of Mrs.Parker!"

He fixed me with a frigid stare, his words as cold as ice. "But Audrey,while I'm not unmindful of the kindness you've extended, you'd do well to remember that my patience with you has its bounds. Don't overstep the mark!"

He took a step toward my bed, but Astrid moved between us. "You son of a bitch, do you have any clue what you're spouting?" she snarled. "You didn't even have a clue she was pregnant, and where were you when she lost your baby? Oh right, picking up your precious Laurel from JFK. That was your child too, for God's sake!"

I could see the pain and regret in Blake's eyes. But his voice
remained cold. "Ive said it before, this is strictly between me and Audrey. Butt out!" Blake bellowed. "Get the hell out of here!"

"You bastard!" Astrid raised her hand, on the verge of slapping him right across the face.

"Don't, Astrid." I stopped Astrid. "Could you give us a moment? I need to speak with him privately."

Astrid's eyes filled with concern. "Audrey, don't go soft on him,okay?



I looked at him - really looked at him. The man I'd loved for five years. The man who had never once looked at me the way he looked at Laurel. "I won't." My smile was gentle but firm. "Promise. It's about the divorce."

She hesitated for a moment, then squeezed my hand. "Fine. I'll head home first and fetch you some clothes. If anything goes wrong,just give me a call! I'll be here in a flash."

Then, as she passed by Blake, she glared at him and said, "Audrey is still in a fragile state. You'd better not do anything to agitate her, or you'll rue the day you ever crossed me!"

Before he could even open his mouth to reply, Astrid stormed out of the room. The door shut quietly in her wake.

Blake settled into the chair she'd vacated, his expression cold and distant. "So," he said. "You really want a divorce?"
###Chapter 8: What Do You Want This Time?

**Audrey's POV**

I studied Blake's face as he sat in the chair beside my hospital bed,the familiar aristocratic features that had once meant everything to me, the cold detachment in his eyes evident. Five years of loving this man, and now all I felt was a vast emptiness inside.

"So,you really want a divorce?"

I let my gaze drift around the room. "Yes," I said quietly, surprised by the steadiness in my own voice. "This time, I really want a divorce.



I met his gaze steadily, surprised by how calm I felt. "You must've seen the papers I left, right?"

With a sudden movement, he pulled out the old divorce agreement I'd left at the Lunar mansion and threw it atmy face. The papers scattered across my hospital blanket like fallen leaves.

"Three years ago, you refused twenty million to leave. Now you're not only asking for divorce but claiming you'll leave with nothing?"His voice dripped with disdain. "Audrey Sinclair, at least make your act believable."


The divorce papers felt heavy in my hands, likethe weight of all my past declarations of love. Three years ago, when he'd first woken from his coma, I had refused to divorce him. Not because twenty million wasn't enough - money had never been what kept me by his side. I couldn't leave him then because I loved him too much.
How ironic that my devotion from back then had become his weapon of mockery today.

A bitter smile curved my lips as I gathered the scattered papers. "Isn't it better if I leave with nothing?"

Blake's expression flickered for a moment before settling back into its usual mask of indifference. "It would be good if you really wanted to leave with nothing," he said coldly. "But we both know that's not true. Tell me, what do you want this time?"

"You think everything I do is about wanting something from you?"

"Isn't it always?" He moved closer, his expensive cologne filling the air between us. "Is this about Laurel? Are you trying to force my hand?"


I almost laughed. Of course he would think this was about Laurel.Everything in his world revolved around Laurel Rose, Hollywood's returning princess. The woman he'd been waiting for all along.

"No," I said softly. "This isn't about Laurel. This is about me finally accepting reality."

"Reality?" His voice showed his sarcasm. "And what reality would that be?"


"That this marriage was never real." The words came easier than I expected. "It was all just my own delusion. You never loved me-I know that now."


I saw a hint of strange expression on his face. But it was gone before
I could be sure. Suddenly, Blake stood up, his tall frame casting a shadow over my hospital bed. "Drop your little schemes," he said coldly. "Be a proper Mrs. Parker. Laurel won't fight with you for anything, and you should stay away from'her. Don't try to bother her.



I bit my lip silently.

Since Laurel's return from Europe, I'd done nothing but try to step away from this marriage. Yet Blake still assumed I would target her somehow.


This was his second warning about Laurel.

How ridiculous it all was.

At that thought, I looked up at him, forcing down the emotions threatening to overwhelm me. "I'll check out of the hospital right now," I said slowly, meeting his cold gaze. "Let's go to the courthouse and file for divorce."


"Once we're divorced, you won't have to worry about me bothering your precious Miss Rose anymore."

Blake let out a cold laugh. "I don't have time for this. Return to the Lunar mansion within three days, then I'll let this slip away."

"Blake Parker!"

He didn't even pause, his tall figure striding toward the door with practiced elegance.
As I watched his retreating back, something inside me finally shattered. A familiar metallic taste flooded my mouth, warm and thick. He didn't look back, not even when the first drops of blood stained the pristine white hospital sheets. His footsteps never faltered,even as they mixed with the sudden commotion outside.

"Patient in 2306 is vomiting blood!"

The urgent voices of the medical team rushed past him in the hallway - them running to save a life, him walking away from one.The contrast would have made me laugh if I could still breathe.

*How fitting*, I thought as darkness crept in. The man I'd spent five years loving couldn't spare even a backward glance, while strangers were racing to keep me alive.




"Girl, you need to eat something."

Astrid's voice pulled me back to consciousness. Evening had settled over the city, painting the sky outside my window in shades of purple and gold. She sat beside my bed, a container of homemade vegetable soup steaming on the side table.

"I made you some light soup with fresh vegetables," she continued,watching me with worried eyes. "Though honestly, you've been sleeping so much lately. Since you're already at Mayo Clinic, why not get a full checkup?"

I managed a weak smile. "It's just fatigue from the procedure."
"Right." Her tone made it clear she wasn't buying it. "That's why you look worse after a week of rest. I just saw on Page Six that your husband was shopping at St. Regis with that woman."

The mention of Blake and Laurel didn't hurt as much as it should have. Maybe I really was finally letting go.

"Let him shop wherever he wants," I said, pushing myself up to sit."I've made my decision."

"How did your talk with him go earlier?"

I stared at the city lights beyond my window, remembering the scattered divorce papers, his cold laugh, his dismissive stride as he left me bleeding. "I told him I want nothing. I'll leave with just my personal belongings."

"What?" Astrid's voice rose sharply. "Nothing? Then why won't he just agree to the divorce?”

I thought about Blake's ultimatum. Three days to return to the mansion. But I had my own countdown now - three months left to live. For once, Blake Parker's threats seemed insignificant in comparison.

"It doesn't matter anymore," I said quietly. "His agreement isn't necessary."

Astrid studied my face for a long moment. "You're different," she finally said. "Something's changed."

"I'm just tired," I told her, which wasn't exactly a lie. "Tired of
pretending."

She reached over and squeezed my hand. "Then stop pretending.You don't owe him anything."

*If only you knew*, I thought, remembering the truth about that day five years ago when I found him, blind and injured, in that small village. Buat this was a secret I would take to my grave.

"You're right," I said, squeezing her hand back. "I don't owe him anything anymore. Mrs. Parker is in the past."

I took a sip of the soup. "By the way, where's Snow and my things?"

"Found you a nice two-bedroom apartment," Astrid said. "Snow and everything are there. It's bright, cean,and most importantly-the Parkers won't find it."

"Thank you," I said softly. "How can I repay you?"

Astrid's eyes lit up. "After your treatment... let's go to our old bar?Like we used to with Rachel, before..." Her voice trailed off.

"Before everything changed," I finished quietly. "Sure, I'll keep you company. The underground bar, right? It's been a long while."
###Chapter 9: Still Can't Reach Mrs. Parker

**Blake's POV**

Another transcontinental video conference finally wrapped up.I leaned back in my leather chair, loosening my tie as the New York skyline twinkled beyond the floor-to-ceiling windows of my office.It was just like a normal day, but something felt off, like an itch I couldn't scratch

I stood up, staring out at the nighttime view. From my office on the top floor of Parker Group, I could see the entire city, and this view usually helped me think. Tonight, the city lights just seemed to mock me.

*Three days.* That's what I'd given her at Mayo Clinic. Three days to end this ridiculous game and return to the mansion. The deadline had come and gone, and still no word from her. Not even a message to say she was alive.

The crystal tumbler in my hand creaked under pressure as I rememnbered our last encounter in the hospital. Her pale face,those steady eyes as she asked for divorce. I dared not look closely and could only hastily depart, barely nnoticing the group of doctors passing by me.

"Sir." Michael's voice interrupted my thoughts. "Mr. William Parker sent over some artisanal chocolates from Switzerland for Mrs. Parker."


I didn't turn from the window. The throbbing in my temples was getting worse. "Have them delivered to her."
"Mr. Parker specifically requested bomyec his 80th birthday gala in three days." Michael's voice carried that particular note of careful hesitation I'd come to recognize. "He mentioned that he misses her."

"I got it. Just send them to her." The words came out more exhausted than I intended. Three days of silence from Audrey were wearing on me more than I cared to admit.

"Sir..." Michael's pause was telling. "We still can't reach Mrs. Parker."


The crystal tumbler stopped halfway to my lips. "What do you mean you can't reach her?"

"We've been trying all the usual channels...”

I turned sharply. "Have you checked the mansion?"

"Mrs. Parker hasn't..." Michael swallowed visibly. "She hasn't returned there."

"What about Mayo Clinic? She hasn't been discharged?"

"The hospital informed us that... Mrs. Parker was discharged yesterday. They don't know wwhere she went..."

The tumbler hit my desk with enough force to make Michael flinch.


"Sir," Michael suggested. "Maybe you can try Mrs. Parker's family.She probably went back to her... home?"

I reached for my phone, scrolling to a number I rarely called. It rang four times before a male voice answered.
"Mr. Sinclair. 'The name Teno Parker."

"Blake?" Her father's surprise was evident, "Is everything alright?"

"Have you heard from Audrey recently?"

"Audrey?" There was a pause. "We haven't heard from her in months.
" Another pause. "Is something wrong between you two?"

I could hear the judgment creeping into his tone. "Nothing's wrong."

"You know," he continued, his voice taking on that particular tone of false concern I'd heard at every Sinclair family gathering, "I always said Audrey's country upbringing might make her... dlifficult to handle.Perhaps if you'd chosen someone more suited to your social circle..."

I closed my eyes. The Sinclairs' tendency to disparage their own daughter had always grated on me, even when I was being equally dismissive of her myself. The hypocrisy of that thought wasn't lost on me.

"That won't be necessary," I cut him off coldly. "Good evening, Mr.Sinclair."

I was about to call another contact when my phone buzzed with an incoming call. Alex Rhodes' name flashed on the screen.

"Blake, The Underground,now!"

"Not in the mood, Alex."
NOm
me pause. "Wait till you see this photo I'm sending. You'll definitely be in the mood then. Get over here!"

The photo loaded a moment later. My grip on the phone tightened until I heard the case crack.

Something dark and possessive roared to life in my chest. Before I consciously made the decision, I 'was already striding toward the elevator. "Michael!" My voice cut through the office like a whip. "Get me the car,right now!"

The elevator ride down to the parking garage felt endless. In my pocket, my phone buzzed again - probably Laurel, wondering why I'd missed our dinner plans. I ignored it. Right now, all I could think about was the photo Alex had sent: Audrey, in a crowd at The Underground, wearing something that looked nothing like her usual conservative choices. And she was reaching toward a dancer's exposed abs.

My car's engine roared to life, its growl matching my mood.*Audrey Sinclair, you're completely insane!*

The Underground was already in full swing when I arrived, the bass vibrating through the sidewalk as I approached the entrance. The usual crowd of hopefuls parted like the Red Sea as I strode past the velvet rope, the bouncers nodding in silent recognition.

The bass from the club hit me before I reached the door. Inside, the scene from the photo was playing out in real time. The dancer,now completely shirtless, had pulled Audrey onto the stage. She moved
with a grace I'd never seen berore,nerledfcos ca6she followed his lead.

I could see the dancer boldly lift her up, even placing her hand on his abs. The deafening cheers from the side of the stage were overwhelming, and I just felt my anger about to burst from my mind.

"Audrey!" A woman's drunken voice cut through the music. "This is the real you!"

I recognized Astrid Wilson, Audrey's ever-present friend, swaying at a VIP table.

"Life's too short not to enjoy it!" Astrid raised her glass. "Let Blake Parker go to hell!"

"Who should go to hell?"
###Chapter 10:Why Won't You Let Me Go?

**Blake's POV**

The words left my mouth before I could stop them. Astrid spun around, nearly losing her balance. When she saw me, her eyes narrowed with drunken hostility.

Before she could respond, the music stopped, the lights on. On the stage, Audrey threw up one hand to block the light, her other still resting on the dancer's chest.

"What's going...” Her words died as her eyes found me standing next to Astrid. Approaching the stage, I caught the slight widening of her eyes, seemingly surprised by my appearance. Why this expression?

The shirtless dancer, a young man, stepped forward. "Hey man,what you wanna do?"

His body was positioned protectively between me and Audrey. The sight of him - young, muscled, still glistening with stage sweat -made something dark twist in my chest.

"Get out of my way." The words came out like ice. I tried hard to keep my voice flat despite the rage burning through my veins.

Through the harsh stage lighting, I could see phones being raised.I should have stopped them, but I didn't bother.

The dancer shifted, muscles tensing, but didn't move. "Miss?"

"Looking for me?" Audrey's voice carried that new edge I'd never
heard before tonight. The same tone she'd used at the hospital when demanding divorce.

"What do you think?" The muscle in my jaw twitched as I watched her, standing there in that red dress that looked nothing like anything she'd worn in our three years of marriage.

"Should I call security?" The dancer asked, stilI playing protector.

I almost laughed. Security? At The Underground? Every bouncer in this club knew better than to interfere with Blake Parker.

"No need." Audrey's voice was gentle as she addressed the dancer."He's my ex-husband."

"Ex-husband?" The words tasted like acid. I could feel the vein pulsing in my forehead, my carefully maintained control slipping.

"That's what you'll be, sooner or later." Her calm was infuriating.This wasn't the woman who'd spent three years carefully tiptoeing around my moods. This was someone else entirely - someone who didn't seem to care about consequences anymore.

"Let's talk downstairs."She gestured toward the VIP section, adding with a hint of steel in her voice, "Unless you want tomorrow's Page Six headline to be 'Parker Group CEO's Public Meltdown at The Underground?"

The mention of publicity should have cooled my temper. Instead,it just fueled the fire. How dare she threaten me? How dare she stand there, looking so different, so untouchable?
She turned to the dancer, her smile warm in a way it hadn't been for me in weeks. "Keep the show going, I'll handle this."

"Will you come back later, Miss?"

"Sure."

"Great! We'll save your spot!"

The casual exchange made my blood boil. Without waiting for more,
I grabbed her elbow - gentler than I wanted to, harder than I should-and steered her toward the VIP lounge.

The lounge was soundproofed. I barely waited for the door to close before rounding on her. "You check out of Mayo Clinic just to watch male strippers?"

She leaned against the window, the city lights spilling from the adjacent panes creating a halo around her silhouette. The sight was strangely disconcerting. "Just enjoyed a dance show. Don't make it sound so scandalous."

"Since when did the perfect Mrs. Parker become such a wild one?"I couldn't keep the sarcasm from my voice.

"I'm no longer your wife! We're getting divorced!" Her eyes flashed with an anger I'd never seen before. "As a single woman, I can do whatever I want. Watch dancers, date men - it's none of your business anymore!"

Something snapped inside me at her words. I crossed the space between us in two strides, caging her against the window with my
arms. "We're still legally married."

"Why won't you sign the divorce papers!?" Her voice cracked slightly."I'm stepping aside for you and Laurel, what more do you want?"

The mention of Laurel's name should have reminded me of my obligations, of promises made. Instead, it just fueled the possessive rage burning in my chest. This woman, who'd spent three years being the perfect wife, was suddenly acting like none of it mattered.

"For three years," she continued, each word like a shard of ice,"I accepted your shame of our marriage, your obsession with Laurel,everything! The moment she's back, I'm giving you both what you want. Isn't that enough?"

Her eyes were bright with unshed tears. "Why won't you divorce me?Why won't you let me go?"

Her vulnerability made something in me pause. After a moment of tense silence, I frowned. "It's not about Laurel. Don't interfere with me and her."

"Fine! Then you shouldn't interfere with me going to clubs and appreciating other men's abs!"

Without warning, I grabbed her wrist, ignoring her startled gasp as I pressed her palm flat against my abs. Her eyes widened as she instinctively looked down at where I'd placed her hand.I watched her face carefully, noting how her cheeks flushed slightly at the contact.

"You wanna touch this, huh?" I sneered, completely showing my
sarcasm. "Why look elsewhere when your husband is right here?Satisfied now?"

"Not really," she said, puling her hand away with obvious distaste.She grabbed a tissue and wiped her hand as if touching me had sullied it. "The dancer outside is much better. Maybe spend less time shopping with Miss Rose and more time at the gym. She might like you better then"

She flashed a cold smile and headed for the door. "I've said what I needed to say. I'm leaving."

Before she could step out, I grabbed her arm, pinning her against the door with my body.

I heard her sharp intake of breath from pain, but something primal had taken over. I gripped her chin and crashed my lips against hers.

The kiss was rough, demanding. I felt her freeze in shock, her body rigid against mine. When I finally forced her lips apart, she started struggling.

"Stay still," I growled against her mouth, my voice rough with desire."Isn't this what you wanted? Using these tactics to get my attention,because I haven't touched you in so long,right?"

My hands started roaming lower, voice dropping to a husky whisper."I'll give you what you want,"

"Blake! This is a club!" The panic in her voice was evident as she tried to push me away.
"It doesn't matter!" I could hear the pulsing music and crowd noise through the door. "If that's what you want so badly, we'll just do it right here."
###Chapter 11: Don't You Love Me Anymore?

**Audrey's POV**

His hands were rough, demanding, tearing at my clothes with a violence I'd never seen from him before. The expensive silk of my dress ripped beneath his fingers. In that moment, as his grip moved lower, something inside me finally shattered.

"Blake Parker!" The scream tore from my throat, raw and desperate."Have you forgotten I just miscarried ten days ago!?"

My voice echoed in the soundproofed VIP lounge of The Underground, bouncing off the floor-to-ceiling windows. The city lights blurred through my tears.

"If you want me dead, just kill me directly," I choked out. "Don't humiliate me like this!"

For three years of marriage, I'd believed that even if Blake didn't love me, he was at least a decent husband. Cold, perhaps. Distant,certainly. But never cruel. Never this... monster who would try to force himself on me just days after I lost our child.

The irony was bitter - he thought I was trying to seduce him, when all I wanted was to walk away with whatever dignity I hadleft.

His hands froze. In the dim lighting, I could see the moment awareness crept back into his eyes, replacing the dark possessiveness that had scared me more than I wanted to admit. He stepped back as if burned, his breath coming in harsh pants.
"I apologize." His voice was rough, controlled again but barely.

I pushed myself up from where he'd pinned me against the wall, my legs shaking. My fingers found the torn strap of my dress, trying to hold the fabric together. Each breath sent sharp pains through my abdomen - a reminder of everything I'd lost.

"Don't apologize." My voice came out steadier than I expected."Just sign the divorce papers."

The city sprawled beneath us, a sea of lights that seemed to mock the darkness in this room. How many times had we stood in places like this - him the powerful CEO, me his secret wife? How many times had I convinced myself that his indifference was better than nothing?

"I'm not trying to get your attention," I continued, meeting his gaze directly. "And I'm not competing with Miss Rose."

His expression changed at the mention of Laurel. Of course it did. It always had, even before she came back from Europe.

"You were right before." The words tasted like ash. "I took advantage of your coma, and married you. That was selfish of me. Now that Laurel's back, I'm setting you free. And myself too."

He let out a harsh laugh. "When I wanted a divorce before, you refused no matter what. What changed?"

*I'm dying.* The words pressed against my teeth,but I swallowed them back. He didn't need to know. Not now. Not ever.

"I refused because I loved you..."
"And now?" His voice dropped, dangerous again. 'Dont you love me anymore?"

"That's not important." I was surprisingly calm. "What matters is I want a divorce now."

He reached into his pocket - probably for the cigarettes he always carried but rarely smoked. His hand stilled halfway. Another thing he was trying to quit, another habit he was trying to control.

"Remember what's in three days?" The sudden change of topic almost made me stumble.

I searched my memory, pushing past the fog of pain and medication."Your Grandfather's birthday?"

"I thought Mrs. Parker had forgotten in her newfound freedom."He said ironically. "Grandfather even had Swiss chocolates sent over for you today. He specifically requested your presence at his birthday gala. Yet here you are, doing everything to escape the Parker family."

The mention of his Grandfather made my heart ache. Sweet,protective William Parker, who had always treated me like a real granddaughter despite my country upbringing. Who had no idea these would be the last few months he'd have with me.

"I'll be there for William's birthday," I pulled out my phone,adding it to my calendar with hands that only shook slightly. Three months left to live - I had to mnake every moment count.

The door burst open before Blake could respond. Ethan Davies, the dancer from earlier, stood there with concern written across his
features. His eyes darted between us, taking in my torn dress and Blake's thunderous expression.

"Miss, are you okay?" Ethan stepped into the room. "He didn't hurt you?"

Blake's face darkened. "Mrs. Parker. Since you know you just miscarried, you should be resting at home, not getting intimate with dancers in places like this. That's disgraceful... and harmful."

"Watch your words!" Ethan shot back. "Stop pretending to care about her health - I can see who's really hurting her!"

I watched Blake's hands clench into fists, saw his eyes narrowed. For a moment, I thought he might actually hit Ethan. Instead, he turned on his heel and stormed out, slamming the door hard enough to rattle the windows.

Ethan opened his mouth, clearly ready to say more, but I cut him off.

"That's enough," I said gently. "Thank you for standing up for me.But you don't even know my name - there's no need to make him angry."

"Actually, I know it, Miss Sinclair," he said. "Im Ethan Davies. To be honest, Astrid gave me five hundred to say those things. She wanted to make that arrogant CEO jealous. But seeing how he treats you...I got genuinely angry."

I could see the affection growing in his eyes, genuine, sweet, but I couldn't, wouldn't respond to it. So I just smiled and said, "It's okay.I appreciate the thought."
The main bar was quieter when I finally made my way down to meet Astrid. She was perched on a barstool, watching me with worried eyes.

"Ethan's quite the young, handsome dancer," I said, sliding onto the stool next to her. "You only paid him five hundred to pretend to like a soon-to-be-divorced woman?"

Astrid snorted. "Market rate is two hundred! I paid him double! You should have seen Blake's face when he left - wouldn't even acknowledge his friend Alex's greeting."

Her expression turned serious. "Did he agree to the divorce?"

I traced patterns in the condensation on thebar top. "He wants to wait until after his Grandfather's birthday."


"That jerk!" Astrid's voice rose in indignation. "He's just making excuses!"


She grabbed my hand, her grip tight with concern. "Are you really going to the birthday gala? Rebecca and Thalia will be there. They've bullied you for years, and they won't stop now. You just had a miscarriage - can your body handle it?"

I thought about William's birthday. Thought about Rebecca Parker's snide comments and Thalia's deliberate cruelty. Thought about how many more chances I'd have to see any of them.

"I have to go." My voice was firm. "But things are different now.I used to tolerate Rebecca and Thalia's behavior because I cared about Blake, because I didn't want to cause family conflict."
"This time, I won't let them walk all over me."
###Chapter 12: Pack Your Things and Leave

**Audrey's POV**

The red traffic light glowed above St. Regis Hotel like a warning beacon, New York's elite pouring into the hotel in an endless stream.William's birthday celebration promised to be anything but the simple affair he'd requested - when your grandson is CEO of Parker Group,"simple" becomes a relative term.

I stood at the crosswalk, clutching my carefully chosen gift. The pain in my abdomen had subsided to a dull ache, manageable enough that Dr. Evans had reluctantly cleared me to attend.

A sleek black luxury car pulled up to the hotel entrance, drawing my attention. The valet rushed to open both doors simultaneously, and my heart clenched as Blake and Laurel emerged in perfect synchronization. Their matching outfits - her royal blue velvet gown and his bespoke suit of the same shade - caught the light of the setting sun. They looked like something out of a fashion magazine spread: the powerful CEO and his Hollywood princess.

"Isn't that Laurel Rose?" A woman's excited whisper carried across the street. "The actress who just got back from Europe?"

"Yes, with Blake Parker!" Her companion replied. "It's his grandfather's birthday - he's introducing her to the family."

"I heard they've known each other for ages. They must be discussing marriage plans now."

"Look at their matching outfits- they're so in love..."
*So in love.* The words echoed in my mind as I watched as Laurel gracefully slip her arm through Blake's, his hand resting protectively at the small of her back. How many times had I dreamed of walking beside him like that? In three years of marriage, Blake and I had never worn matching anything. In public, I was always just another face in the crowd, a stranger he might nod to in passing.

*Was this marriage just your way of punishing me, Blake?* The thought surfaced unbidden as I watched them disappear into the hotel. Three years of hiding, of tiptoeing around his moods, of being the perfect secret wife... and for what?

The screech of tires interrupted my thoughts. A red car-Blake's birthday gift to his sister two years ago - pulled up to the entrance.Thalia Parker stepped out, an obviously high-ended dress on her body.

Her eyes found me immediately. "Well, if it isn't my sister-in-law."Her voice dripped honey-coated venom. "Heard you lost the baby recently?"

The casual cruelty of her words hit harder than I expected. "How did you know?"


She crossed her arms, her expression a perfect blend of disdain and mock concern. "You couldn't even carry a Parker heir to term, and instead of facing consequences, you had the nerve to ask my brother to send Mother's staff to care for you."

"Mother was too busy to remember your request," she continued,clearly enjoying herself. "And you went crying to my brother about it,
causing chaos in our family."

Something clicked in my mind. *So that's what this is about.* I felt my lips curve into a slight smile. "When did this happen?"

"You're the one who complained, shouldn't you know?"

I almost laughed. Of course Blake hadn't told them about the night at The Underground, about his rage when he found me there,about his desperate attempt to... I pushed the memory away.

"You saw how loving my brother and Laurel are, right?" Thalia's voice turned sickeningly sweet. "If I were you, I'd get a divorce, pack my things and leave now. Better than being thrown out like a sray later."


The calm that settled over me was almost surprising. "Has Blake not told you anything about our divorce?"

Her perfectly manicured hand froze halfway to her hair. "What do you mean? Are you already divorced?"

"Tve signed all the papers," I said, watching her expression shift from smugness to shock. "But he didn't want to. Mrs. Parker? I've been done with that damn title for a while now."


Thalia took a step back, clearly thrown off balance by my response.For once, she seemed at a loss for words.


The grand ballroom was a vision of tasteful opulence when I finally entered, It buzzed with the kind of practiced elegance that only old money could buy. The usual suspects were all here - board members
pretending to enjoy small talk, socialites comparing jewelry, young heirs plotting their next scandal. Across the room, I could see Blake and Laurel holding court among admiring relatives and business associates.

"Audrey!" A familiar voice cut through my observations.

I turned around, my heart sinking as I recognized James Collins making his way toward me through the crowd.

"Good to see you again." His smile was warm,genuine-everything the Parker family's weren't.

"James," I managed, trying to keep my voice steady. "What brings you here?"


"Cartier's partnership with Parker Group," he explained with a self-deprecating laugh. "Drew the short straw to represent us at Mr.William Parker's birthday. You know my luck."


I forced a small smile, even as anxiety churned in my stomach. James didn't know about my marriage to Blake - no one from our college days did. To them, I was still just Audrey Sinclair, the quiet design student who'd disappeared into the corporate world after graduation.

"What about you?" he asked. "Are you here representing your company?"

Before I could answer, he continued, "Did you hear? Mr. Parker just launched Rose JeweIry under Parker Group, With their backing, they'Il be a major player in our industry soon."
My throat tightenea--
could Blake be any more obvious about his intentions?

"When we switched dance partners in LA," James mused, "I had no idea who they were. If I'd known, I wouldn't have missed the chance to network with Mr. Parker and Miss Rose."

I watched his face carefully, but saw only genuine professional interest. No hint that he knew about my connection to Blake.Why would he? Our marriage had been hidden from the world for three years.

"Audrey," James's voice took on a playful tone, "Come on, Let's go say hello."

He grabbed my arm and started walking purposefully toward Blake and Laurel. "Mr. Parker had quite a few interactions with you last time. He should remember you."

I felt my brows knit together tightly as I tried to resist, keeping my voice low. "I don't want to..."


"You were always so shy in college." James's voice was gentle as he continued pulling me forward. "That won't work in our industry.Connections are important."


The ballroom was filled with Parker family relatives and business partners - many of whom knew my true identity. Not wanting to draw attention, I could only struggle slightly.

Perhaps he genuinely wanted to assist me in my career, and I couldn't break free from his grip at all. Before I knew it, the two of us were
almost in front of Blake. Looking at that familiar face, I gave up struggling.

Blake had already stopped chatting with the people around him. His eyes were fixed intently on James's hand on my arm. His face was tense, and the emotions in his eyes were beyond my comprehension.

By his side, Laurel, who had her arm linked with his,noticed Blake's gaze and turned her head as well.

In that instant, I could clearly see the surprise on her face, which was then replaced by an unmaskable look of excitement.

She parted her lips slightly. "Audrey Sinclair? Good to see you here."
###Chapter 13: What's Your Relationship Wit Her?

**Blake's POV**

Laurel's voice was sweet as always, yet the words that harbored a subtle hint of complacency barely registered as I stared at James'hand,which rested on my wife's arm with practiced familiarity.

Just watching the sight made something dark twisted in my chest.After that scene at The Underground, after nearly losing control in that VIP lounge, here she was again - deliberately provoking me.

The golden dress she wore seemed to shine, making her look brilliant.The daring cut revealed more skin than I'd ever allowed her to show in public, and her dark hair fell in loose waves around her shoulders instead of the usual tight bun. She looked like a stranger. A beautiful,dangerous stranger who was currently letting another man touch her far too intimately.

"The man next to Mrs. Parker," Laurel continued,her voice lowering and carrying that particular note of false concern she'd perfected. "I remember dancing with him in LA last time. But why does he grab her arm so easily?"


I kept my face carefully neutra1, but my mind raced back to that night at Mayo Clinic, to Audrey's words that had been haunting me:*"Maybe I should have chosen James."*

They were getting closer now. James Collins, with his perfectly tailored tuxedo and quietly confident demeanor, looking every inch
the successful Cartier executive he'd become. And Audrey - *my wife*-looking more radiant than she had any right to after putting me through hell these past weeks.

"Audrey," Laurel's voice carried across the space between us,"what's going on? Why do you bring this gentleman to Mr. William Parker's birthday celebration?"

I watched Audrey's face carefully,'saw the slight tightening around her eyes - the only sign that Laurel's barb had hit its mark. But before she could respond, James stepped forward, smooth as políshed steel.

"Mr. Parker, Miss Rose." His smile was professionally cordial. "You might remember us from the partner exchange dance in LA. I'm James Collins, representing Cartier today to wish Mr. William Parker a happy birthday."

He turned slightly, and something in the way he looked at Audrey made my blood boil. "This is my junior from Parsons, Audrey Sinclair -she's an exceptional jewelry designer!"

"An exceptional jewelry designer..." The words left my mouth before I could stop them, dripping with sarcasm. My wife, who'd never shown the slightest interest in jewelry beyond wearing the pieces I bought her, was now supposedly some sort of design expert? "How long have you been in the industry, Miss Sinclair? Do you have any work to show? Or rather, do you actually understand jewelry and design?"

I saw her hands clench at her sides, saw the way her nails dug into
her palms - a habit she'd had since college, according to the background check I'd done years ago. When she spoke, her voice was arctic. "I understand jewelry design perfectly well."

"Seriously?" I sneered. "Then may you tell me..."

She lifted her chin, meeting my gaze directly."I have no obligation to prove my expertise to strangers. MIr. Parker, if you're curious about jewelry design, you should educate yourself rather than harassing an unfamiliar designer at your grandfather's birthday celebration."

*Strangers*. The word hit like a physical blow. After three years of marriage, after everything we'd been through, she was standing here calling me a stranger.

I stood there, couldn't believe my ears.

"Mr. Parker," James intervened, his tone conciliatory, "please excuse Audrey's directness. If you have any questions about jewelry design, I'd be happy to answer them."

"What's your relationship with her," I felt my voice drop several degrees, "that you'd answer on her behalf?"


Laurel pressed closer to my side, her designer perfume almost cloying."Miss Sinclair and Mr. Collins seem quite close. Are you dating?"


The silence that followed felt like the calm before a storm.I watched James's face, saw something resolve in his expression, and suddenly knew I wasn't going to like what came next.

"We were in the same collage, and she was my junior. So currently,I'
m taking care of her out of the camaraderie forged within the campus.
" His voice was steady, controlled. "But, once her divorce from her current husband is finalized, I intend to pursue her."

*Pursue her?* The crystal champagne flute in my hand creaked dangerously as the air around us turned glacial.

My eyes narrowed, fixing on Audrey who stood behind James. "You know she's still married," my voice dropped to a dangerous whisper,"then why do you get involved with her?"

James's polite smile never wavered. "I believe you misunderstand, Mr.Parker."


"My relationship with Audrey has always been completely appropriate and transparent," he continued with quiet dignity."Moreover..."


"I hear her marriage has been dead in all but name for some time."James continued, each word carefully chosen. "Her husband openly courts his ex who abandoned him years ago, completely neglecting her. He didn't even visit when she was ill."


"Her current husband doesn't treasure," James's eyes were filled with tenderness as he stared at Audrey, "but someone else will, once they're divorced."


His words still lingered, shifting the atmosphere dramatically.Clinging to my arm, Laurel, who had maintained her picture-perfect smile throughout the evening, couldn't keep up the facade any longer.

My jaw clenched as I swept my cold gaze across Audrey's deathly
pale face. *So this is how she's been describing our marriage to him.*The thought burned like acid, the rage in my chest threatening to consume everything in its path.

"Mr. Parker."

In the tense silence, Charles Wright, my grandfather's butler of thirty years,approached with his characteristic quiet dignity. "Mr. William Parker requests your presence."

I held my gaze on Audrey for one more moment before finally looking away. Shrugging off Laurel's grip on my arm, I turned to leave.


"I'll come with you," Laurel's voice followed as she reached for my arm.

"Miss Rose." Charles's voice turned cold as he positioned himself between us. "Mr. Parker specifically instructed that no invitation be extended to you tonight. May I ask how you gained entry?"

"I brought her," I cut in. "It's time to clear up Grandpa's misunderstandings about Laurel."


I took her hand, ready to leave, but Charles blocked our path again while giving a polite smile. "Sir, I strongly advise against upsetting Mr. Parker on his birthday. You know better than anyone whose presence he welcomes... and whose he doesn't."

Then, to my surprise, he turned to Audrey, his tone warming considerably. "Mrs. Parker, please, say something."
###Chapter 14:Making Up Stories?

**Audrey's POV**

I felt Blake's burning gaze finally shift away, allowing me to breathe a little easier. The awkwardness of the situation hit me full force-at our last meeting at the LA gala, I'd told James about my supposedly perfect marriage, about how much my husband loved me. What a joke that seemed now.

But seriously, how had James learned the truth? The question nagged at me, but there was no time to dwell on it. Charles Wright had just blown my cover entirely.

"Mrs. Paker, Mr. William Parker requests both you and your husband's presence," Charles announced, his voice carrying the quiet authority.

Now that the butler had revealed may identity, there was nothing left to hide. I could only sigh and move to Charles's side.

"Audrey..." James's eyes widened almost comically, shock written across his features. "You..."

I turned back to him with what I hoped was a calm smile. "I'll explain later, James." The words tasted bitter -how many lies would I need to explain away?

"Let's go," I said to Charles, proud that my voice didn't shake.

Charles gave me a gentle smile, then turned to Blake, gesturing forward with a practiced motion that spoke of his decades of service."
Please, Mr. Parker."
I watched as Blake gently released Laurel's hand, his touch so careful it made something in mychest ache. "I need to see my grandfather first. We'll discuss your situation later."

"But Blake..."Laurel's voice carried that practiced vulnerability that seemed to work so well on him.

"Find Thalia or your mother," he said, his yoice gentle in a way it never was with me. "T'll come find you afterward."

The moment Laurel's footsteps faded away, Blake turned sharply and followed Charles. I fell into step behind them without another glance in his direction.


As we walked, Blake's voice came low and cold, meant only for my ears. "So this is how you describe our marriage to your senior?Publicly having affairs, entangling with my ex who abandoned me...you're quite good at making up stories."

A sneer escaped my mouth. "Making up stories? Which part isn't true?" I met his gaze squarely. "You're openly courting Laurel while we're still married. You didn't even visit when I lost ourchild." My voice remained steady, but my nails dug into my palms."Everything James said is true."

I felt it extremely ironic. Every time James and I met, it had been in public. We'd never done anything more intimate than a formal dance at social gatherings. Yet here was Blake, accusing me of making up stories while Laurel clung to him like she had no bones, her body pressed against his at every opportunity.
Blake's cold gaze swept over me, his lips curling with disdain. "Such a strong reaction. Still claiming these aren't your fabrications?"

I narrowed my eyes, studying him. In the past,his suspicion would have terrified me. I would have scrambled to explain, desperate to clear any misunderstanding. But now... what was the point?

"Fine," I said, my voice carrying a chill to match his own. "Believe whatever you want. If it bothers you that much, just sign the papers and let me go."

Taking a deep breath, I quickened my pace to catch up with Charles,deliberately leaving Blake behind. To steady my nerves, I started chatting with Charles about William's health condition.

The private reception room hadn't changed since the last time I'd been here. Still the same dark wood and leather, still the same photographs chronicling Parker Group's rise to prominence lining the walls. William sat in his usual chair, looking frailer than I remembered but with that same sharp intelligence in his eyes.

Olivia Cavendish lounged in one corner with her mother Elizabeth,both of them watching me with barely concealed disdain. Some things never changed.

"Audrey!"

William's face lit up with genuine joy as he rose from his chair,striding toward me with an energy that belied his age. "You're finally here!"

"William." I smiled warmly, placing the gift in his hands. "Sorry for
being late."

"Late? Nonsense! The celebration hasn't even begun!" His eyes crinkled with affection as he took my hand, leading me toward his seat. "Im just glad you're here, just glad you're here!"

Throughout this entire exchange, he hadn't spared a single glance for Blake, his own grandson. Blake, apparently used to this treatment,followed us to the main seating area with practiced indifference,his face a careful mask of neutrality.

"Look how Grandpa dotes on Audrey like she's his own grandchild."Olivia's sweet voice couldn't hide her obvious spite. "But we all know Blake doesn't care for her at all."

I didn't bother looking at her as she continued, "Now that Laurel's back,she'll be thrown out soon enough."


"Olivia!" Elizabeth's false concern made my skin crawl. "Watch your words! Blake and Audrey are very happy!"


She turned to me with a smile that never reached her eyes. "Audrey dear, please don't mind Olivia's thoughtless words. She's still young..."


Sarcastic retorts bubbled up in my throat, but I swallowed them back down. William was right there, and the last thing I wanted was to upset him with any drama. His health had to come first, especially now.

"It's fine, Elizabeth." I continued preparing the tea with steadly hands."I won't take it personally,"
Suddenly, the sound of shattering china made us all jump. William had thrown his teacup against the wall, his face dark with anger. "Is this what those expensive foreign schools taught you, Olivia?" His voice cut through the sudden silence. "How to gossip andsnipe at family members like some common fishwife?"

Elizabeth's face paled. "Dad, she was just-"

"She was just showing her true colors," William cut in. "Just like her mother."

Olivia shrank back in her seat, but couldn't seem to help adding, "She forced her way into the family while Blake was in a coma!"

"Enough!" Blake's voice cracked like a whip. "My marriage with Audrey is none of your business."

The roomn fell silent. everyone stared at Blake, surprised by his intervention, including me. He never acknowledged our marriage in public, let alone defended it.


"Well," William said slowly, "I thought you'd forgotten Audrey was your wife."


"Of course I haven't forgotten." Blake's response came too quickly,too practiced.


"Haven't you, though?" William's voice carried the weight of years of disappointment. "Then explain to me why my grandson is parading another woman at his grandfather's birthday while his wife stands alone?"

###Chapter 15: Who Did You Say Had a Niscarriage?

**Audrey's POV**

William's voice thundered through the private reception room at St.Regis, making my heart skip a beat. His face had turned an alarming shade of red as he confronted Blake about Laurel. At his age, this level of agitation couldn't be good for his health.

"William." I moved quickly to his side, my voice gentle but urgent. "Please don't be angry. Have some tea first."

I gave William a gentle, reassuring smile as I poured the freshly brewed tea into his cup.

William couldn't help but let out a sigh. "When will you stop being like this?" His voice softened as he turned to me, his eyes scanning my figure with growing concern. "Suffering in silence, look how thin you've become!"

Sensing the concern in his tone, my eyes started to sting as I kept the smile on my face. "I'm not suffering,just on a diet."

Three years in the Parker family, and William had been the only one who truly cared about me. Every time he showed such concern,it made my heart ache - knowing that in just three months, I would have to leave him forever.


"Diet?" He snorted,years of seeing through society's pretenses evident in his tone. "I haven't seen you for just over a month, and you're
nothing but skin and bones!"

"Being thin is more beautiful, isn't it?" I kept my voice light,even as I felt Blake's cold gaze sweep over me from across the room. His presence felt like a shadow, heavy with unspoken accusations.

William shook his head, letting out a sigh again. After his third cup,he finally spoke up, "Though I love tea, you can't keep serving me like this. How many cups have I had already?"

He chuckled, some of te earlier tension leaving his shoulders. "Good thing this isn't alcohol, or I'd be drunk before my own birthday celebration begins!"

I refilled his cup anyway. "Just a few more, William. It's your birthday."

Taking advantage of the moment when nobody was noticing me,I quietly slipped some white powders into his cup.

Half an hour later, the birthday celebration officially began.

Under the watchful eyes of everyone in the grand ballroom,I supported William on his left while Blake flanked his right as we made our way to the small stage at the center. Despite being in his eighties, William's voice remained strong and commanding as he addressed the crowd, thanking everyone for attending.


After his speech, a three-tiered birthday cake was wheeled out,a masterpiece of white fondant and gold leaf, as the room filled with the harmonious voices of guests singing "Happy Birthday." The candles were lit, William's voice rang out clear and strong:
"I wish for my grandson Blake Parker and his wife Audrey to live happily together, and give me a great-grandchild soon!"

The silence that followed was deafening. I could feel hundreds of eyes on us, but I maintained my composure. I didn't feel bothered though.

Blake's open displays of affection with Laurel had led everyone to believe she was the woman he truly loved. Every public appearance,every tender gesture between them had convinced New York's elite that I was merely a placeholder in the Parker family. Perhaps that was why James Collins' voice, cutting through the tension like a blade,carried a note of sympathy:

"It's so touching, Mr. Parker! Always putting your family's happiness first,even on your own birthday. I sincerely hope your wish comnes true!"

His words broke the spell. Applause rippled through the crowd,but I barely heard it over the pounding in my ears. A great-grandchild...it had been so close, yet it was merely a dream now.

William turned to us with a smile, taking both my hand and Blake's,joining them together. "Did you hear that? All this applause - they're blessing your marriage!"


I bit my lip as tears started falling. William was using his birthday wish to support me, to shield me from the whispers.

"Don't cry, dear," William patted my head, then looked at Blake."Stop just standing there. Aren't you going to wipe your wife's tears?"
Blake frowned, reaching for a tissue. But before he could move -

"Laurel, what's wrong?"

Thalia's cry shattered the moment. I turned just in time to see Laurel Rose, Hollywood's golden girl, swaying dramatically. Blake was already moving. abandoning his place on stage without a second's hesitation. I wwatched as he caught her, his movements so careful and tender.

"Blake, darling..." Laurel's voice carried perfectly despite her supposed weakness. "You should be on stage with Audrey,celebrating with Mr. Parker."

"What happened? Is your stomach hurting?" The concern in Blake's voice was unmistakable.

Something crashed behind me. I turned to see William standing over a shattered gift box, his face dark with fury.

"Charles!" His voice cracked like a whip. "Didn't I specifically instruct no invitation be sent to Laurel Rose?"

Charles showed up, his expression showing his embarrassment. "Yes,sir. But..."


"Then why," William's voice dropped dangerously, "is someone I don't wish to see at my birthday celebration?"

"I brought Laurel here," Blake said. "Grandpa, I know you have misunderstandings about the Roses. I wanted to clear them up at your birthday."
"Misunderstandings?" William's laugh was cold. "All I can see is a shameless woman who's clinging to a married man in public, right in front of his wife."

Laurel's face turned pale. "I... I didn't..."

Blake stepped in front of her. "She wasn't feeling well."

"Seriously?" William's voice turned sharp. "Lying in your arms can make her feel okay?"

Blake's face darkened.

"William." I stepped forward, and gently reminded. "The cake hasn't been cut yet. Everyone's waiting now. Let's not let this spoil your birthday,okay?"

William stared at me for a long moment before sighing. "Fine. For your sake, I'll let this go today." He shot Blake another cold look."Get back here and cut the cake."

"Blake, darling, you should go,"Laurel's soft voice only made it worse.

"Don't worry, Blake!" Thalia's voice rose deliberately, clearly meant for me to hear. "I'll take good care of her!"

I sensed William watching me, but I concentrated on my task. The cake knife feIt cool in my hand.

"Thank you," Blake's voice came from beside me as we served the cake.


I met his eyes briefly. "William is elderly. Better not make him angry.
" I kept my voice low, "After our divorce,you can do whatever you wanna to make him accept Miss. Rose."
I moved to the next guest, ignoring the weight of his stare on my back.

The dinner dragged on. Despite the elaborate dinner in front of me,J had no appetite and could only take small bites.

"What's wrong? Not hungry?" William's concerned voice mnade me look up.

Before I could answer, Rebecca's low voice carried down the table."Well, that's to be expected. After all, she just had a miscarriage..."

I forced myself to cough, trying to drown out her words. *Not today.Please, not on his birthday.*

But I saw William's hand freeze midair, his glass stopped halfway to his lips.

"Miscarriage?" His voice cut through my desperate coughing.

"Who did you say had a miscarriage?"
###Chapter 16: How Can I Not Be Angry?

**Blake's POV**

Grandpa's voice was so loud that the grand ballroom seemed frozen in time. The soft clink of silverware ceased, conversations died mid-sentence, and even the waiters paused in their tracks. In that charged silence, I could almost hear the rapid beating of Audrey's heart from where she sat beside me.

Rebecca's face paled as she realized her mistake. "No, you must have misheard me,I...”

But it was too late. My grandpa, with his long-cultivated acute powers of observation, upon scrutinizing Audrey intently for an instant, instantly comprehended - her haggard countenance and conspicuous emaciation. I had noticed these changes too, but had dismissed them as another of her attention-seeking tactics.

"Audrey." His voice softened in a way it never did for me anymore. "Tell me the truth. What on earth is going on?"

I watched as she lowered her head, unable to mmeet his gaze. "William,we can discuss this another time..." Her voice carried a plea that made something twist uncomfortably in my chest.

But Grandpa had already sensed blood in the water. He stood up abruptly, his chair scraping against the marble floor. "Is this because of Blake and Laurel?" His voice was filled with anger. "Is that why Audrey lost the baby!?"

The entire ballroom fell silent. I could see Laurel shifting
uncomfortably in her seat, while Thalia started to comfort her. The situation was spiraling out of control.

"Grandpa, please don't get angry..." I dried to intervene, but my words only seemed to fuel his rage.

"How can I not be angry!?" His face reddened dangerously. "I've been waiting three years for a great-grandchild! Audrey finally gets pregnant, and now she's lost the baby! What the hell did you do, as her husband!?"

The accusation hit harder than I expected. I opened my mouth to defend myself, but Audrey's voice cut through the tension.

"William," she spoke with a steadiness that surprised me. "Please don't blame Blake. I had an accident, that's why I lost the baby."

Something about her lie made my fists clench under the table. Why was she still protecting me? After everything that had happened,after the scene at The Underground, after my behavior at Mayo Clinic -why?

"We can discuss the details tomorrow," Audrey's voice was soft but steady. "It's your birthday, William. Everyone is watching."

Grandpa's jaw was tightly clenched, and the veins on his forehead seemed on the verge of bursting.

After a long moment, he looked at Audrey with such profound pain and tenderness that I felt like an intruder witnessing it. "Audrey, I am truly sorry," he said quietly.′′Inever imagined they would treat you this way."
"It's alright," Audrey's smile was serene, though it didn't reach her eyes. "Today is about celebrating your birthday. Let's not talk about this."
Grandpa closed his eyes, his expression twisted with grief. He shook his head but remained silent.
Perhaps it was the emotional toll of the evening, but he barely touched his dinner before claiming fatigue. "Charles," he called, his voice heavy with exhaustion. "I think I'll retire for the evening."
Charles appeared immediately at his side, helping him up with practiced care. As they left the room, whispers erupted around us -

"Poor Audrey,still protecting the family's image while Blake Parker parades around with Laurel Rose."

"That's what being a proper society wife means!"

"Please, she's just a country girl who got lucky. What does she know about true refinement?"

The words reached my ears, each one carrying a sting of truth I wasn't ready to acknowledge. I watched as Audrey kept her eyes fixed on her plate, pushing food around mechanically. How many times had she sat through dinners like this, pretending not to hear?

"Speaking of refinement..." Thalia's voice carried across the table."Shouldn't you be giving up your seat tosomeone more...suitable?"As she said this, she smirked at Audrey, glancing meaningfully at Laurel.
I should have stopped my sister. Should have said something. Instead,
I just sat there, watching Laurel make her way to Thalia's side,a triumphant smile playing on her lips.

"I beg your pardon?"

Audrey rose from her chair with practiced elegance, her movement drawing every eye in the room. "Would you mind repeating that?I didn't quite catch what you said."

She was already the focus of whispered conversations, with people watching her from the corners of their eyes. Now, as she stood, she commanded the attention of the entire room.

Seeing all eyes turn in their direction, Thalia rolled her eyes,lowering her voice with obvious irritation. "Stop making a scene! I'm right next to you. Do you need hearing treatment? Should I pay for it?"

"Then that would be a generous offer."

What happened next shocked even me. With deliberate slowness,Audrey raised an eyebrow, extending her hand to Thalia. "A hundred thousand dollars, I believe that should cover the medical costs."


This wasn't the woman who'd spent three years carefully tiptoeing around my moods. This wasn't the Audrey Sinclair who'd married me while I was in a coma, who'd refused twenty million to leave.

Thalia froze."What?"

"Oh, I'm just repeating your offer," Audrey's smile was razor-sharp."Didn't you just suggest paying for my medical treatment? I think I
truly need it."

Thalia finaly found her voice, her words coming out in a hiss. "A hundred thousand dollars? Are you out of your mind?"

"Didn't you just spendI two hundred thousand renting a club for Miss Rose's party?." Audrey's voice was casual, but her eyes glinted dangerously.

She tilted her head slightly, her expression one of mock concern. "As your sister-in-law, I surely deserve at least half that, right?" Her gaze flicked briefly to Laurel. "Or perhaps... spending on Miss Rose has left you short?"

People started whispering. Great, another Parker family drama for them to gossip about.

"Enough." I lowered my voice. "What happened to you? Why make a scene now?"


This wasn't likeher at all. She'd always kept quiet before, even when things were worse. Now she was demanding money oversome stupid comment?


"A hundred thousand dollars, Mr. Parker," she said,looking straight at me. "Care to pay?"

"Haven't I given you everything?" Where was the one who'd always backed down, who'd accepted whatever I gave her without complaint?

"Now, now," Laurel chimed in as she reached for her own designer purse. "There's no need for such hostility. If Audrey feels that money
would help..." She made a show of writing out a check, her signature as dramatic as her acting.

I watched a cruel smile play at Audrey's lips - an expression I'd never seen on her face before. She picked up Laurel's check with two fingers, as if handling something distasteful. "Miss Rose, you've been quite close with my husband lately. Consider this hundred thousand as rent payment." She met Laurel's startled gaze directly. "If you want to keep borrowing him, my attorney can draw up a proper lease agreement with appropriate rates."

The silence that followed was absolute. Rage surged through me at her audacity. "Audrey!" My voice came out as a growl. "What did you say?"

"So that's what I am to you? Just something to be rented out?"
###Chapter 17: Have You Ever Seen Me as You Wife?

**Audrey's POV**

A bitter smile curved my lips at Blake's furious question. Just as I was about to respond with everything I'd held back for three years -

"Audrey dear," Laurel's voice cut in, "what's this about... renting? Blake isn't some commodity to be leased out."

Looking at Laurel's exaggerated performance made my stomach turn.I took a sip of the orange juice William had specially prepared for me,my voice coming out cool and composed:

"Oh?" I met her gaze steadlily. "I think I'm being perfectly accurate." I turned to face Blake, who sat rigidly in his chair. "Don't you agree, Mr.Parker?".


The formal address made his jaw clench. Good. Let him feel a fraction of the pain I'd been carrying.


I looked around slowly, my voice carrying across the silent ballroom."Actually, why don't you weigh in on this, Mr. Parker? Since we're all here together."


The pain in my abdomen intensified, but I refused to let it show. Not now.Not when I was finally ready to say everything I'd been holding back for three years.

"William isn't well, and this is his birthday celebration." My voice came out cold, stripped of all the warmth I'd once held for this family."That's the only reason I've tolerated this behavior until now."
I watched Blake's expression darken, saw Laurel's perfectly manicured hand reach for his arm. The gesture made something snap inside me.

"Three years of marriage," I continued, each word precise and cutting."You didn't know when I was sick. Didn't care when I was pregnant."I turned to face the gathered crowd, no longer bothering to keep this private."When I was losing our child at Mayo Clinic, you were putting on a show at JFK, welcoming Miss Rose back from Europe."

As I said this. I could feel every heartbeat pounding through my body, but I wasn't done. Not yet.


"During my recovery from the miscarriage, you were too busy attending galas in Los Angeles with Miss Rose to check on me." My voice didn't waver. "And now, at William's birthday celebration, you jump off stage to catch her in your arms."

I met his eyes directly. "Have you ever seen me as your wife?"

I'd practiced these words too many times to count before tonight, alone in my room, in front of my mirror. I thought I was ready. Thought I could say it all without flinching.


But standing here now, watching his face as I ripped open three years of carefully hidden wounds - it still hurt.


My stomach cramped violently. The painkillers I'd taken before coming here were wearing off, but I couldn't let it show. Not now. My hands curled into fists, my body slightly trembling.

Around us, whispers erupted. From the corner of my eye,I could see the shocked faces of New York's elite - the same people who'd watched me play the perfect Parker wife for three years. The woman who never
complained, who smiled through every slight, who maintained composure no matter what.

I caught Rebecca's open-mouthed stare, saw Elizabeth lean over to whisper something to Olivia. They'd never seen me like this. Never thought I'd dare to speak up.

Blake's face darkened with each word I'd spoken, but something else flickered in his expression. For the first time since I'd known him,the CEO who could silence a room with one cold look seemed at a loss for words.

"Audrey..." Laure's voice turned fragile, practiced vulnerability replacing her earlier smugness. "Blake didn't know about the miscarriage when he came to pick me up. And the LA gala - we just happened to run into each other..."


A bitter laugh escaped me. "And just now? When Blake abandoned me,and even his grandfather on stage to catch you - was that coincidence too?"

Blake stood up abruptly, moving to shield Laurel. "She's unwell," he growled. "Her stomach's bothering her. Am I not allowed to show concern?



The concern in his voice struck me as darkly ironic. Here I was, with terminal gastric cancer, spending countless sleepless nights doubled over in pain. My husband had never noticed, never bothered to ask why I'd grown so thin.


Yet Laurel had been back for less than two weeks, and her slightest stomach discomfort sent him into a panic.

It wasn't that he didn't know how to care. He just didn't think I was
worth caring about.

"Of course you are." I gave a peaceful smile. "Care for her all you want.I'm done trying to stop you."

My hands didn't shake as I pulled out the divorce papers. "I'm divorcing Mr. Blake Parker," I announced to the silent room. "Ending our three years of loveless marriage, and I'll no longer be Mrs. Parker!"

I paused, scanning Laurel and the crowd of New York's elite. "Miss. Rose...or other ladies who've had their eye on Mr. Parker but were too principled to be a homewrecker might want to step forward now." My smile turned razor-sharp. "Only the best woman can win the position of Mrs.Parker."

At my words, I watched the gleam of triumph in Laurel's eyes turn dark.Of course - I'd just publicly labeled her as a homewrecker,hadn't I?

I could read the rage in Blake's expression, his hands into fists, his fury barely contained. The look he gave me promised a storm. To him, our marriage was between us- my asking for divorce was just another tantrum he could overlook. But announcing our divorce in front of the Parker family's social circle, laying bare his relationship with Laurel piece by piece?That was unforgivable.


"One last thing." I took a deep breath, my gaze sweeping overto Rebecca and Thalia. "Since I've made up my mind, I will no longer tolerate any abuse from the Parker family. Consider this fair warning."

"You scheming little bitch." Thalia's voice cut through the shocked silence."Getting ahead of the inevitable eviction, aren't you? Three years enjoying Parker luxury, and you couldn't even carry a child to term."
The mention of my stillborn child sent a sudden sharp pang through my heart, but I kept my expression calm.

"Thalia!" Blake's brow furrowed, either finding her words too harsh or deciding this scene had gone on long enough. His voice dropped low.trying to rein in his sister.


But she wasn't done. "No wonder the baby couldn't survive in someone as toxic as you." Her voice rose with each word. "You must know you're worth less to my brother than a single strand of Laurel's hair. Just a country girl who manipulated her way in while my brother was in a coma."


The pain medication had completely worn off now. Every breath sent daggers through my abdomen, but the physical pain was nothing compared to the words being hurled at me. Three years of careful composure, of being the perfect Parker wife, crumbled in an instant.

The sound of my palm connecting with Thalia's cheek echoed through the ballroom.


For a moment, everything stopped.
###Chapter 18: You Planned This Long Ago?

**Audrey's POV**

Everything I'd held back for three years -every snide comment,every deliberate slight, every moment of humiliation - had finally found its release in that single strike. The red mark blooming on Thalia's perfectly made-up face matched the mounting fury in my chest.

"You..." Thalia's eyes widened in disbelief, her carefully applied makeup beginning to smear as tears welled up. "You actually dared to slap me?"

I could hear the whispers around us. Those socialites who'd spent years watching me endure the Parker family's abuse were now covering their mouths in shock. Three years of playing the perfect, docile Mrs. Parker had made them forget who I really wwas.


"Not even Mother has ever hit me!" Thalia's voice rose to a shriek, her hand covering her reddening cheek.


Before I could respond, Laurel rushed to Thalia's side, her white evening gown trailing dramatically behind her. Ever the actress, she played her part perfectly-the concerned friend, the protective almost-sister-in-law.


"Thalia!" Laurel's voice dripped with manufactured concern as she examined the other woman's face. "Are you alright? Does it hurt terribly?"

"It burns!" Thalia's voice cracked, tears now freely running down her face.

Laurel gasped theatrically. "Oh no... what if it leaves a scar? What about your beautiful face?"


I almost laughed at their performance. Three years ago, this scene would have terrified me-the perfect Hollywood actress comforting the Parker
princess. Now? I felt nothing but cold contempt.

Rebecca stormed towards me, her face twisted with rage,all pretense of her graceful sophistication abandoned. "You bitch!" Her manicured hand rose,ready to strike. "How dare you touch my daughter?"

I side-stepped her attack smoothly, watching as she stumbled in her high heels. Blake caught her just before she could fall, but I noticed his eyes were fixed on me with an intensity I couldn't read.

"I warned you," I said, my voice carrying across the now-silent ballroom."I would not tolerate any longer."

I turned around, intending to grab the divorce papers I'd placed on the table earlier, only to find Laurel already holding them at some point,studying their contents with exaggerated interest. I couldn't be bothered to fight her for them. Instead, I pulled out another copy from my bag and slammed it onto the table with a sharp crack.

"Let's sign the papers right now!" I pulled out a pen and shoved it into Blake's hand. "Mr. Parker, you've always been so eager to please your mother,haven't you?"


Blake gripped the pen I'd forced into his hand, his brow furrowing as his gaze moved between the papers in Laurel's hands and the new copy. His eyes narrowed dangerously.


His jaw tightened. "You planned this long ago? To humiliate me at my grandpa's birthday?"

I raised an eyebrow. "Is there a problem?"

When I'd promised to attend William's birthday celebration, I'd already planned everything carefully. William was highly respected, and all the
Parker family's relatives and friends would be here for his birthday.I deliberately chose this occasion, knowing Blake wouldn't be able to maintain his composure in front of everyone. He would have no choice but to sign the divorce papers.

I didn't have much time left. I couldn't afford to keep dragging out this divorce with him.


I couldn't bear to ruin what would be my last birthday celebration with William. That's why before the party started,I'd kept encouraging him to drink more tea, secretly mixing sleeping powder into his cup.


Yet despite all my careful planning, William's birthday celebration had still been ruined in the end.


"Laurel." Thalia was still rubbing her slapped cheek, her voice bitter. "Did that bitch try any tricks in the agreement?"

Laurel shook her head. "No tricks, but..." She pursed her lips, her manicured finger pointing to the final item on the agreement. "She wants to take a Ragdoll cat named Snow..."


As she spoke, she glanced at Blake with affected concern. "Blake darling.is this the cat you mentioned to me before?"

Blake nodded curtly. "Yes."

I raised an eyebrow coldly. "I didn't realize Mr. Parker would discuss even my cat with Miss Rose."

Turning to Laurel, I added, "Is there a problem with me wanting Snow?"

Snow was Blake's gift for our first wedding anniversary. Back then, I'd been so happy I could barely contain myself, thinking he'd remembered
how much I loved Ragdoll cats, I thought our relationship was finally progressing.

But later, I learned the truth...

Snow had been Thalia's impulsive purchase from Europe. She'd grown tired of the cat within days and nearly abandoned her.

During our three years of marriage. I'd spent most nights alone in that cold mansion. Every time I had nightmares, it was Snow who comforted me, curling up beside my pillow, her soft fur offering what comfort she could.


So while I could leave everything else behind in this divorce, I had to take Snow with me. Even after I was gone, I would make sure Snow stayed with Astrid. I couldn't trust the Parkers with her.


"That cat cost me tens of thousands when I bought it from Europe."Thalia's voice dripoped with disdain as she finally recalled abandoning the young Ragdoll. "You're divorcing my brother-what right do you have to take my property?"

I frowned,fixing her with an icy stare. "Your property? Apart from importing her from a European breeder, what have you ever done for Snow?"


"That doesn't matter! She's a Parker cat!" Thalia's voice rose hysterically."And you know what? I think Abe would love a new playmate."

*What?* I slightly widened my eyes.

Abe, Thalia's Tibetan Mastiff- that two-hundred-pound beast with a history of violence. Just the of my gentle Snow anywhere near it made my blood run cold. But I wouldn't give her the satisfaction of seeing me flinch.
"Interesting." I met her gaze steadily. "For someone so eager to see me leave,you seem awfully invested in keeping me here."

Her face darkened. "What do you mean by that?"

I allowed a small smile. "Using Snow to force my hand... seems like someone's afraid of losing their favorite target."

After a long pause, she narrowed her eyes. "Right, someone like you would probably use a cat as an excuse to stay married."

"I was thinking of using that catto get back at you for that slap. But on second thought, that seems unnecessarily complicated."

She stood up and strode toward me. "I'll just hit you back directly.Won't delay my brother from throwing you out!"

"Watch out - that bitch's got quite a temper now!" Rebecca hurried after her daughter. "Let me help you!"
###Chapter 19: Remaining Time Is Too Long?

**Audrey's POV**

I stood motionless, watching Rebecca and Thalia approaching me step by step. My teeth dug into my lower lip as I tried to steady myself. The evening had already drained so much of my energy, and now my stomach felt like it was being twisted by invisible hands.

Just standing here with my spine straight took almost all the strength I had left. How could I possibly defend myself against these two?

Everything seemed to slow down. I caught Blake's movement from the corner of my eye - a half-step in my direction, an aborted gesture of protection that died the moment Laurel's voice cut through the tension.

"Thalia, Rebecca!" Her breathy cry was perfectly timed, perfectly pitched.I watched as she pressed one manicured hand to her stomach, her gown highlighting her dramatic swoon. "Oh... it hurts..."

Blake's attention shifted instantly as he turned to Laurel. The concern in his eyes was so palpable and unfamiliar - to me. "Are you alright? Where does it hurt? Should I call a doctor?"


The scene burned into my vision, but I had no time to process the pain it caused. Rebecca and Thalia were already in front of me, their faces twisted with fury. Rebecca grabbed both my hands, pinning them down, while Thalia raised her palm high above her head and slapped on my face with a sharp crack.

It somehow cut through all the noise of the ballroom. The entire hall fell into an unnatural silence. I could see the guests starting to whisper and point, their words lost in the buzzing that had taken over my mind.
I watched as Blake's body suddenly went rigid. And in that same instant,Laurel -who had been playing the delicate invalid just seconds ago -rushed forward with surprising agility.

"Thalia, Rebecca, please!" Her voice showed her false concern as she positioned herself between us. "We're all famnily here - can't we talk this through?"


I almost burst into laughter against her words, as her presence between us was just another calculated move - while pretending to mediate, she helped Rebecca hold me in place.


Rebecca's grip tightened further as she encouraged her daughter."There's no need for that! She needs to learn her place in this family!"


I saw Thalia raise her hand again, and gasps and shrieks erupted from the crowd below. Ignoring the searing pain in my stomach, I summoned every ounce of strength I had left and wrenched my body away.


The sudden force of my movement was so violent that it pulled both Rebecca and Laurel off balance as they gripped my arms. In that chaotic moment,Thalia's slap landed squarely across Laurel's face instead of mine.The next moment, a thin line of blood appeared at the corner of her mouth.


"Laurel! You're bleeding!" Rebecca's horrified cry could have won her an Oscar.


The next few moments blurred together. Blake shoved me aside with enough force to send me stumbling into one of the ballroom's marble pillars. The impact sent shockwaves of pain through my abdomen,but I couldn't look away from the sight of him gathering Laurel into his arms.cradling her as if she were made of glass.
The metallic taste filled my moumbee didn't remember shedding. I watched Blake carry Laurel away,his touch so gentle it made my heart ache. The last thing I saw before darkness claimed me was James Collins running toward me, panic written across his features.

The first light of dawn filtering through the windows of the Mayo Clinic was overly intense. Every beam felt like a needle behind my eyes as I struggled to consciousness. The familiar antiseptic smell mixed with something else - expensive cologne. Not Blake's - I'd know his anywhere.James.


He must have been watching for signs of waking because the moment my eyes fluttered open, he pressed the call button. "Thank God," he muttered,relief evident in his voice. "You've been out for hours."


I tried to speak, but my throat felt raw. The pain in my stomach had intensified to a burning knot.


"Take it easy," James moved closer to my bed, reaching out to grasp my hand tightly. "Audrey, does the Parkers know about your condition?"

I didn't reply, instinctively trying to pull my hand away from his, but his grip was firm. My silence answered hisquestion.


James let out a soft breath, but his brows remained deeply furrowed. "Even without knowing about your illness, what the Parkers did last night was inexcusable."


"Especially Blake," he continued. "You know, last night, my boss specifically asked me to find a chance to get close to Blake, build a good relationship for future cooperation."
"But seeing what he did to you, I felt..." He paused, looking at me intently."YouI're making the right choice, divorcing him."

I curved my lips into a desolate smile. "I..."

Before I could finish, the door to the hospital room was pushed open. Dr.Evans swept into the room, her expression thunderous.


"What were you doing last night?" She didn't wait for an answer as she checked my vitads. "Extreme emotional distress, physical trauma to the stomach..." Her eyes met mine, sharp with understanding and something like grief. "Do you think your remaining time is too long?"

I closed my eyes against her words, against James's sharp intake of breath.When Dr. Evans finished her examination, hervoice softened slightly. "I understand choosing not to pursue treatment. That's your right. But if you keep putting your body through this kind of stress..."

She didn't need to finish the sentence. We both knew the remaining three months I had left had become uncertain.


After she left, James frowned. "Are you... really not going to seek treatment? Just waiting for death like this?"

I lifted my gaze, forcing a pale smile. "It's cancer, I can do nothing about it.
The treatment is long and painful, with no guarantee of success. I just want to live well for whatever time I have left."


James stared at me. "Audrey, I understand your nature." James's were warm and steady. "Once you've made a decision, nothing will change your mind. But..." He squeezed my fingers gently. "Let me stay with you for whatever time remains. Please?"

I could hear the tenderness in his voice, the unspoken confession beneath
his words. But I had no right to respond to such feelings - not now, not with my remaining timeslipping away like sand through an hourglass.

I frowned slightly and tried to withdraw my hand, but James only tightened his grip, refusing to let go.

"I..." The word barely left my lips when another voice cut through the moment like ice.


"What exactly are you planning to do with her?"
###Chapter 20: Are You Planning to Be A Ho me wrecker?

**Audrey's POV**

Hearing the familiar voice, I felt my heart skip a beat as I instinctively looked toward the doorway.

Blake stood there at some point, elegantly rolling up his sleeves as he walked in with a cold smile. His presence seemed to instantly fill my ward,making the space feel smaller somnehow.

"My. my..." His eyes fixed on where James's hand still held mine. "What a touching scene."


I watched as he moved deeper into the room, each step seemingly pounding on my heart, making me unconsciously feel a bit nervous."Promising to stay with a married woman..." His voice was filled with sarcasm. "Mr. Collins, are you planning to be a homewrecker?"


James's hand tensed over mine before he quickly withdrew it. "Mr. Parker.watch your mouth."


"Are my words inappropriate, or are your actions unseemly?" Blake moved closer, with a fake smile on his face. "How touching, your closeness.



"This isn't what you're thinking," James started to explain, but Blake cut him off with a sharp gesture.

"So this is why you're so desperate for divorce?" His eyes bore into mine,cold and accusing. "For him?"
Hearing this question, I felt something inside me grow still. Here he was,after spending every waking moment with Laurel since her return, having the nerve to question my integrity and my friendship with James? The bitter irony of it all nearly made me laugh.

"It has nothing to do with James," my voice came out steadlier than I expected.

"Blake Parker," James's voice took on an edge I'd never heard before, "you're the one being unfaithful with Laurel Rose. Don't project your sins onto Audrey!"


The hospital room's atmosphere grew heavier with each passing second.Blake's presence was suffocating. The famniliar ache in my stomach began to intensify, but I forced myself to remain still.

"Ever since Laurel returned," he continued,each word precise and cutting,"you've been acting out - terminating our child, announcing divorce at Grandfather's birthday."


The mention of William's birthday made my chest tighten. The memory of last night was still too fresh - the public humiliation, Thalia's slaps, Blake rushing to catch Laurel while I collapsed...


Blake's cold gaze fixed on me as a cruel smile played at his lips. "You know, I actually felt guilty before, thinking I'd neglected you by paying too much attention to Laurel."

"But now I see - all of this was just an act. You've been conspiring with your dear senior Collins all along, haven't you?"

I bit my lip hard, clutching the hospital blanket tighly as I looked at the sneer on Blake's face. The pain in my stomach was nothing compared to
the despair crushing my heart.

"Blake!" James interjected, cutting through the tension, his voice tight with barely contained anger. "Audrey's health is fragile, watch your words!"

Blake's laugh was cod enough to lower the room temperature. "I've checked. Just some minor stomach issues. Why the dramatics?"

"Trying to copy Laurel's bleeding to get my attention, aren't you?" His eyes narrowed."Your acting skills have improved considerably."

Looking at his cold expression, listening to his sarcastic words, I had never felt him more like a stranger than in this moment. A bitter smile played at my lips.


Yes, I had asked Dr. Evans to list my cancer as a simple stomach ailment to hide the truth. But James had seen through it almost immediately. If Blake had shown even a fraction of the concern he lavished on Laurel,he would have discovered the real diagnosis long ago.


"This isn't an act!" James stood up so quickly his chair scraped against the floor. "Blake Parker, have you no conscience? Audrey is actually...”


"James, stop!" I cut him off before he could reveal my condition. The last thing I needed was Blake's pity - or worse, his disbelief.


The silence that followed was deafening. Blake's gaze flickered between us,something dark and possessive flashing in his eyes.


"You used to claim you loved me," he finally said, his voice unnaturally calm. "Refusing divorce no matter what I said."

I watched him pace the room like a caged predator. "But right after finding a replacement, you're desperate to leave."
His next words came out like a whip crack: "Now let me tell you, Audrey.Until I agree, you'll remain Mrs. Parker until death."

The irony of his words wasn't lost on me. "Until death"- if only he knew how soon that would be.

"Moreover, my relationship with Laurel isn't filthy like yours with James!Everything between Laurel and me is open and above board. Nothing improper."

"But you two..." His eyes narrowed dangerously. "You claim to have only met twice recently in public, but who knows what's been going on behind closed doors? Only you and your dear senior know the truth of that, don't you?"


That was the final straw for James. Before I could blink, he had Blake by the collar.


"She gave you everything!" James's voice shook with fury. "Nearly died for you! You can insult me all you want, but how dare you slander her reputation!?"

"You dare strike me?" Blake's voice was deadly quiet.

"The way you treat her," James's grip tightened, "I should have done this long ago!"


Within seconds, the pristine hospital room devolved into chaos as both men threw away all pretense of civility. The sound of expensive suits tearing and bodies slamming against hospital furniture filled the air.


Blake had become quite obsessive about physical training after his coma,often spending hours in the gym to rebuild his strength, so after just a few exchanges, I could see James beginning to falter, bruises already darkening
across his face.

"Blake, stop!"I tried to get out of bed, my legs shaking beneath me. The familiar vertigo that accompanied my condition threatened to overwhelm me, but I forced myself forward. "Please!"

Neither man seemed to hear me. The burning pain in my stomach was becoming unbearable, but I had to stop them. I couldn't let them destroy their reputations like this.

"Let's talk about this," I pushed myself between them, my voice trembling with the effort of standing. "Don't-"

The impact came before I could finish. Blake's elbow caught me in the stomach as he swung at James. The pain exploded like a supernova,and I could no longer hold back. A spray of blood erupted from my mouth,splattering across Blake's suit.

The last thing I saw before darkness claimed me was Blake's face,his expression shifting from rage to horror as I collapsed.

The world faded to black. *So, is this the end of my marriage... and my life?* I thought as consciousness slipped away.
###Chapter 21: The Picture of Health and Vitality

**Blake's POV**

Time seemed to freeze as I watched the blood in her mouth and her legs gave way beneath her. I stood there motionless, feeling something cold and terrifying grip my chest.

James caught her before she hit the floor, his face contorted with fury."How can you do this to Audrey? She's a patient, damn it!" His voice echoed through the hall. "Someone get Dr. Evans! Now!"

I stood frozen, unable to move as medical staff rushed past me. This wasn't supposed to happen. She was supposed to be faking it, playing for sympathy like all those other times. But the blood - there was so much blood. And her face, usually so carefully composed, had turned the deadly pale.

Nurses appeared with a gurney, their movements precise and urgent.I found myself backed against the wall, watching helplessly as they lifted her limp form from James's arms. Her hair spilled across the white hospital linens.

Security arrived within minutes, positioning themselves between James and me. The lead guard's voice carried quiet authority: "Gentlemen, thisis Mayo Clinic. Any further altercations and we'll have to involve the police."

I barely heard him. My eyes were fixed on the trail of blood droplets leading to the emergency treatment room where they'd taken her.James stood on the opposite side of the corridor, his designer suit rumpled, a bruise darkening along his jaw where I'd struck him. The hostility
radiating from him was almost tangible.

But I ignored it. I was lost in my thoughts, with waves of fear and anxiety building up in my heart. Three years ago, when I was ina coma,was this how she felt? Waiting outside my room, unable to do anything but watch through the glass as doctors and nurses moved around my unconscious form?


After what felt like an eternity, Dr. Evans emerged from the treatment room, her expression serious. Her white coat was pristine except for a small spot of blood near the hem. "The location of impact couldn't have been worse," she announced without preamble. "Her lesion is in the stomach. We've already dealt with it, and there's no major issue. But the pain won't completely subside for a while."

At this moment, the treatment room doors opened again. A nurse beckoned urgently to Dr. Evans, who nodded, shifting her gaze between me and James before saying, "Come in and help move the patient back to her room. Just one person."

Both of us immediately moved toward the treatment room doors.

"Just one," Dr. Evans held up her hand, blocking our path.


"I'll go," James said firmly. "I've been taking care of her since she wvas admitted yesterday."


Dr. Evans started to nod, lowering her arm, but I stepped in front of James,my jaw tight. "I'm her husband. It should be me."

She narrowed her eyes, coldness in them obvious, "So, you're the husband who's been too busy for her appointments?" Her contempt was unmistakable. "Meeting you in person has been... quite the challenge."
I didn't quite get her sarcasm. "I've been busy. She just had minor health issues, I couldn't always be there."

"Minor health issues." Dr. Evans's laugh was cold and bitter."You really don't know your wife at all."

She let out a sighfinally lowering her arm. "Fine. Go ahead."

Inside the emergency room, the harsh fluorescent lights made everything seem too bright, too real. Audrey lay surrounded by medical equipment,looking smaller and more fragile than I'd ever seen her. Her eyes fluttered open as I approached, and I found myself searching for any sign of her usual dramatic flair. Instead, I saw only exhaustion and carefully contained pain.


In our three years of marriage, I had never seen Audrey look so fragile.The thought that my own actions had reduced her to this state made me feel incredibly guilty.

"I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to..." The words felt hollow even as they left my mouth. "I never intended..."


"It's fine," she said softly. "Just an accident. I know that no matter how much you hate me, you'd never intentionally hurt me."

The candid look in her eyes made my chest tighten inexplicably.

I sighed, helping the nurse wheel her bed out of the emergency room.

"Audrey, how are you feeling?" James rushed forward the moment we emerged,his face full of concern.


"It's my fault," he continued, shooting me an angry look. "I shouldn't have gotten you involved in all this..."
"What are you doing?" I frowned, seeing his movements. "It was an accident. Stop trying to cause trouble."

"Accident?" James stood his ground. His voice rose with barely contained fury. "It was fucking deliberate! You just love bullying her, just like your family!"

I felt my hands clench at my sides, jaw tightening at his presumption.Who was he to judge my family? To stand there playing protector to *my*wite?


"James..." Audrey's voice was barely above a whisper. "Please stop. Get checked out and go home."

James hesitated for a moment before letting out a resigned sigh. "Fine,Audrey,I'm leaving now. Take care of yourself. Call me if you need anything."

Before walking away, he turned to me with a threatening glare. "If you hurt her again, I won't let you off!"

I pushed Audrey's bed toward her ward. "If he had stayed any longer,I might have hit him again."

Audrey closed her eyes wearily. "I knew it, and that's why I asked him to leave."


I narrowed my eyes at her. "So you were worried about him? Are you protecting him?"

She kept her eyes closed, offering no response to my question, which felt like an answer in itself. It made something dark twist in my chest.

Back in her ward, I found myself drawn to the collection of medications
lined up on her bedside table. Picking up one of the bottles, I studied the label. "What kind of illness makes you cough up blood like this?"

"Just stomach problems." She moved quickly, almost defensively,taking the bottle from my hand and replacing it. "An old condition that's been acting up lately. Nothing serious -just need a few days' rest. Sometimes certain foods trigger it."


"Seriously?" I couldnI't keep the skepticism from my voice. "And I suppose you just happen to have bleeding gums too?"

Her slight nod only fueled my suspicion. The bleeding gums would explain the blood - a clever trick, really. After all, this was the same woman who had single-handedly managed my care when I was in a coma.I remembered her strength then, carrying my much larger frame to the bathroom, her constant chatter filling the silence of my unresponsive state.She had been the picture of health and vitality.


"So the blood you coughed up - is it from your bleeding gums?"Everything clicked into place. "If this were really serious, like gastric cancer,you wouldn't be faking symptoms so dramatically."

The smile she gave me was strange - almost pitying. "You're right. I didn't think you'd see through it."


Her easy admission seemed to confirm my suspicions, but I felt no relief.Her pale face, her trembling hands, the way she'd snatched that medication bottle from me -everything suggested there was more to this than she was letting on.


But I couldn't bring myself to dig deeper. Was it fear holding me back? Or guilt? It was easier to convince myseIf that yes, she was just acting, as she always did...
My phone's sudden ring cut through the moment - it was my grandpa.

I stared at it for a long moment. Finally, with more reluctance than I cared to admit, I answered the call.
###Chapter 22: This Can't Be a Gift for Me,Right?

**Audrey's POV**

The moment Blake answered, William's thunderous voice blasted,making him pull the phone slightly away from his ear.

"You brat, why did it take so long to answer?" William's voice carried clearly through the speaker, sharp with anger.

"I was busy." Blake's tone remained usually composed, betraying nothing of the chaos from last night.

"Where are you now?"

"At the hospital with Audrey."

There was a brief pause, and when William spoke again, his voice had softened considerably. "How is she doing?"

"She's fine. Just some stomach issues."

"Then why did she vomit blood?" William's voice was sharp with concern.


"Don't worry, just bleeding gums." Blake rubbed his temples wearily."Nothing serious."

I almost laughed out. *Nothing serious.*

"I've heard about what happened last night," William's voice turned ice cold. "Make sure Audrey gets proper rest at the hospital. Then come back to the mansion alone. We need to have a serious talk."
"There's no need for that. E'll bring her back..." Blake started, but William cut him off.

"Alone. Within thirty minutes. Let her rest." The finality in William's tone left no room for argument. "And Blake... you better have a good explanation for last night."

Blake ended the call with a sharp exhale, his expression darkening as he turned to me. "You heard him." Blake's voice was cold as ice. "Since you caused all this trouble last night, you're coming with me. Get dressed."

I nodded, pushing myself up from the hospital bed with careful movements. "I was planning to talk to William about the divorce anyway."

In that instant, I could see the despondency and anguish that welled up in his eyes - I couldn't fathom why. But he quickly masked it and turned away,remaining silent.

The evening gown was ruined. Dark bloodstains had dried into abstract patterns across the expensive fabric, a stark reminder of how quickly things had spiraled out of control. I held it up, studying the damage with detached interest.


"Could you accompany me to buy some clothes?" Feeling helpless,I looked at Blake. "I can't wear this,"


He raised an eyebrow, and before he could respond, his phone chimed with a new message. The way his entire demeanor changed as he checked it told me exactly who it was from.

"Blake darling," Lâurel's voice sounded, "I'm really fine. Don't worry so much, I'm not made of glass,"

"Send me your medical report," Blake demanded, his tone suddenly gentle
with concern. "Tll only believe you're fine when I see what the doctors say.



"Alright. I'll ask the doctor for the report right away!" Laurel's sugary voice floated through the phone speaker. "I'll send you photos as soon as I get it!"

"Good girl." The soft smile instantly disappeared as he put down the phone. "It's just some blood. Were you this fussy back in the countryside?”

The contrast between his cold mockery of my request and his tender concern for Laurel should have hurt. Instead, I found myself fighting back an inexplicable urge to laugh.

I didn't want to argue with him, just saying, "Well, I surely can wear that,but it's blood anyway. Do you think William will fly into a rage upon seeing it?"


Blake hesitated, his brows furrowing in irritation before he strode toward the elevator. "There's a Parker Group shopping center nearby."

To save time, I walked into the first boutique we came across in the shopping center, quickly picked out two clean-looking outfits, and headed straight for the changing room.


Having just woken up and not having had much rest, although the pain in the stomach had subsided, I was still extremely weak. I almost fainted while changing clothes.


When I emerged from the changing room, Blake was gone. A quick scan of the boutique's entrance showed no sign of him. Of course - he probably had more important things to do than wait for his soon-to-be ex-wife to try on clothes.
Assuming Blake had gone back to wait in the car, I hurried toward the shopping center's exit. But as I passed by a jewelry store, I caught sight of him through the window -standing at the counter,examining what looked like wedding rings. The sales associate was gesturing enthusiastically,clearly in the middle of a well-practiced pitch about their latest engagement collection.

Something cold and bitter settled in my chest as I watched, and the pain in my stomach began to spread anew: Without conscious thought, I found myself pushing open the heavy glass door and walking straight to the counter.

"I'll take this pair," I interrupted whatever the salesperson was saying."Please wrap them up. I'll pay."

Blake's head snapped up. He frowned and asked, "What are you doing?"

"Aren't you going to propose to Miss Rose with these rings?" I smiled, the expression feeling foreign on my face. "They would be perfect."

"What nonsense are you talking about?" His voice dropped dangerously low. "When did I say I was proposing to Laurel?"

I maintaíned my smile, though it felt more like baring teeth now. "Then why are you suddenly interested in rings, Mr. Parker? It can't be a gift for me,right?"


"Since you're so eager to buy them, go ahead!" Blake's voice was cold as he turned sharply and strode out of the store.

I turned back to the display case, selecting a delicate diamond ring. "I'll take this one too," I told the sales associate. "Please wrap it up with the pair we just looked at."
Outside the store, looking at the pair of rings in the bag, I tried to ignore that twinge of heartache, yet it was beyond my power. I made my way towards the exit. I could feel that my steps were becoming unsteady due to my weakness, and there were even people' around casting sympathetic glances my way.

Blake was already waiting in the car, his expression dark. I got in and held out the shopping bag containing the rings. "Here. When are you planning to propose to Miss Rose?"

Blake glanced at me, his expression dark. Noticing my shaking hands,His pupils shrank, and he seemed to struggle with words for a moment before closing his eyes and saying coldly, "None of your business!"

I laughed softly, brushing a strand of hair from my face. "Oh, but it is.You need to divorce me properly before you can propose to anyone."

"No rush."

"Maybe you're not in a rush, but what about Miss Rose?"


He raised an eyebrow, his smirk cold and mocking. "If you're so eager,why don't you propose to her yourself?"


I rolled my eyes and turned away to watch the scenery passing by my window. "Buying your engagement rings is already more than generous.Don't even dream about me proposing for you!"


The thought crossed my mind -all I wanted was a quick divorce, to free myself from this hopeless marriage before death. It wasn't that I lacked self-respect.

The car sped through the familiar streets of New York.
Two blocks from Parker Mansion, I pulled out my compact mirror and began touching up my makeup. In this recent short period of time, I've coughed up blood twice. My face has turned as pale as that of a corpse.However,in front of William, I still want to make my complexion look better, at least to prevent him from detecting anything amiss.

Since this might be the last time I'd ever see him, I needed to leave him with a good final impression.
###Chapter 23: I Won't Divorce Her

**Blake's POV**

The light through the car windows fell across Audrey's face as she meticulously applied her makeup. I watched her from my position in the leather seat, noting how her hands trembled slightly as she held the compact mirror. She'd lost so much weight that her cheekbones cast sharp shadows beneath her eyes, no matter how skillfully she tried to conceal them.


"You should eat more," I found myself saying. "Being too thin isn't good for you."

Her hand froze mid-motion, the makeup brush hovering inches from her face. A bitter smile curved her lips as she met my eyes in the mirror."Why the sudden concern? Since when did you care about how I look?"

I frowned and turned toward the window, watching the New York streets
blur past. Her words brought back memories of earlier at the jewelry store.While she was changing clothes, I'd wandered in to check on potential partnerships for Parker Group's expansion into the jewelry industry. She'd found me there, examining engagement rings, and immediately jumped to conclusions. The hurt in her eyes had been unmistakable, even as she'd
insisted on purchasing those rings herself.

My mind drifted further back, to three years ago when I first saw her.Parker Group had been in its expansion phase, and I was too busy to visit my grandpa in person. But every day on our calls, he would mention"little Audrey"- how attentive she was, how she brightened up the whole medical center.

I still remember that first glimpse of her. The sun had been streaming
through the hospital windows, casting a golden glow around her as she pushed open the door to my grandpa's room, arms full of carnations."William, it's me!" Her voice had been so full of life, her face glowing with youth and vitality.

Looking at her now, I could barely reconcile that vibrant young woman with the pale, worn figure beside me. When had she gotten so thin?When had those shadows taken up permanent residence under her eyes?

The car pulled up to the Parker mansion's entrance. Audrey was out the door before the vehicle had fully stopped, already striding toward the house. I caught up in a few quick steps, reaching for her hand.

"What's the rush?"

She tried to pull away, her voice tight. "Is this really necessary?"

I tightened my grip, feeling how fragile her fingers felt in mine. "You're my wife. Can't I hold my wife's hand?"

She rolled her eyes but stopped resisting, though I could feel the tension thrumming through her entire body. The contrast between her current coldness and her previous devotion sent an inexplicable pain through my chest.


The mansion's front door opened before we reached it. Charles, our butler,gave us his usual dignified nod, though I caught the slight frown that crossed his features as he took in Audrey's appearance.

The living room fell silent as we entered. Granpa sat in his usual place,while Elizabeth and Olivia occupied the left sofa. On the right sat my mother Rebecca and sister Thalia, with Laurel between them,her face partially covered in bandages.
Laurel was dabbing at her eyes with a tissue as we walked in. "Mr. Parker,I know you don't like me, but I was at your birthday celebrationlast night." Her voice quavered. "Look what happened to me at your party... You can't ignore this..."

"Yes,grandpa." Thalia immediately moved to protect Laurel. "She's a Hollywood star, her face is her career. With these injuries, she can't film for a while. This seriously impacts her career!"

"This is all Audrey's fault!" My mother's voice cut through the room like a knife.


"Grandpa."' I kept my voice steady, though I could feel Audrey trying to pull her hand from mine.

The room fell silent. I watched as Laurel's eyes fixed on our joined hands,something dark flashing across her face before she quickly resumed her vulnerable expression.


I frowned, thinking it was just my imagination.

Grandpa's face brightened as he looked at us. "Look at you two,getting along so well! After hearing about last night, I thought you were really getting divorced!"


I felt Audrey tense beside mne. She frowned, trying again to free her hand."
William,you misunderstand,we..."

"We're very happy together," I cut her off firmly. "Everything Audrey said at the gala last night was just a tantrum." I met my grandpa's eyes steadily."I won't dlivorce her."


The silence that followed was deafening. I could feel the weight of everyone's stares -Laurel's barely concealed fury, my mother's shock,
Thalia's confusion. But most of all, I felt Audrey's hand trembling slightly in mine.

Looking down at our joined hands, I was struck again by how thin her fingers had become. When had this happened? How had I not noticed?The thought made something twist uncomfortably in my chest.

"Blake," Thalia's voice dripped with confusion and barely concealed anger."What do you mean? Audrey publicly, announced she wants a divorce.She even hit Mother and me!"

"That's right!" My mother's voice rose sharply. "She humiliated all of us at your grandpa's birthday party! How can you still..."

"Enough!" Grandpa's voice cut through the rising tension. "The boy's made his decision. That's all that matters."

Audrey's hand was cold in mine, but I refused to let go. Whatever game she was playing with those divorce papers, whatever reason she had for her dramatic announcement at the party - I wouldn't give her the satisfaction of winning.


"But Blake..." Laurel's voice carried that particular note of calculated innocence I'd grown too familiar with lately. "Last night, everyone heard Mrs. Parker announce her divorce from you."


I watched as she bit her lip in that deliberately delicate way of hers."Though I haven't had many chances to interact with her, I always thought she was such a sensible, gentle person."

My grip on Audrey's hand tightened unconsciously as Laurel continued,her eyes wide with practiced concern. "But last night... She completely disregarded both her own and the Parker family's reputation. Publicly
demanding divorce, even striking Mrs. Parker and Thalia..."

Through our joined hands, I felt Audrey's slight tension as Laurel fixed those big, innocent eyes on her. "Mrs. Parker, was it really just a tantrum with Blake?"


Before Audrey could respond, my mother's cold snort cut through the room. "A tantrum?" The word dripped with disdain.


"In all of New York's elite circles," she continued, each word sharp as glass,"I've never seen any proper lady throw a tantrum by announcing divorce and attacking her mother-in-law and sister-in-law in front of our entire social circle."


I felt Audrey's pulse quicken as my mother's voice rose with mounting fury. "For three years, everyone praised her grace and elegance. The perfect society wife! But last night? Complete disregard for consequences!"


Mother's eyes narrowed dangerously. "After such a public spectacle, how am I supposed to show my face in society if she remains a Parker? And what about the blows Thalia and I took?"


She turned to me, her expression hardening. "Since she's taken things this far, I don't care what her real intentions were. This marriage ends today."
###Chapter 24: Let Her Be Free

**Audrey's POV**

I watched the hatred twist Rebecca's features as she stared at me,her delicate makeup doing nothing to hide the fury in her eyes. I couldn't help but give a sneer.

Taking advantage of Blake's momentary distraction, I finally managed to pull my hand free from his grip. The burning sensation in my stomach had intensified, but I forced myself to stand straight. I wouldn't show weakness. Not now.


"Interesting how the real aggressors are the first to complain," I said, my voice steady despite the effort it took to remain standing.

Rebecca's eyes narrowed dangerously. "I'm your mother-in-law, Thalia is your sister-in-law. Isn't it our right to discipline you?"

A bitter smile touched my lips. The irony was almost amusing. "So it's your right to hit me, but when I defend myself, you run crying to William?



The glasses on the coffee table trembled as William's hand came down hard on its surface. "What is she talking about?" His voice carried the authority of someone used to commanding boardrooms. "Rebecca?"


I watched as Rebecca's confidence faltered slightly. Thalia, who had been maintaining a hostile silence, suddenly found the carpet fascinating. I kept expressionless as I continued.

"Would you like to tell William about how you both attacked me last night?" I asked, my tone conversational."Or should I describe how you
held me while Thalia slapped me?"

William's face darkened with each word. "Blake," he turned to his grandson, voice dangerously low. "You just stood there watching your mother and sister attack her?"


"Oh no," I cut in before Blake could respond, watching his jaw tighten."
He didn't just watch. He pushed me into a marble pillar to get to Laurel."

"I did not push you," Blake's voice was cold as if telling me that it wasn't him that night. "I was merely separating you two."


William's teacup hit the floor. "When you were in a coma," his voice shook with barely contained fury, "Audrey cared for you day and night. Have you forgotten everything?"

I swayed slightly, grateful for the chair behind me as another wave of dizziness hit.


"William," I said softly, drawing his attention away from Blake. "I need to tell you something."

The room fell silent as I forced my legs to carry me to the center of the room. Every step felt like walking on broken glass, but I kept my spine straight. This was it - the moment I'd been preparing for a long while.

"I had this idea since I lost my child - I want a divorce."

Blake's sharp intake of breath was the only sound in the suddenly still room. I could feel his eyes burning into me, but I kept my gaze fixed on William.


"From the beginning," I continued slowly, "this marriage was my one-sided love. Blake never cared for me. When Laurel returned..." I paused,
swallowing against the metallic taste that threatened to rise in my throat."Well, everyone can see where his heart truly lies."

I took a steadying breath, gathering my courage. "William, I hope you can understand and support my decision. I...”

My words died in my throat as William's face suddenly turned a sickly shade of white. His hand clutched at his chest as he gasped for air, each breath seeming more difficult than the last.

"Charles!" Blake shouted.

Charles appeared instantly with a bottle of heart medication, his usual composed demeanor showing cracks of genuine concern.

"You know grandpa can't handle such news," Blake's voice cut through the tension like ice. "Are you trying to kill him?"

Thalia let out a cold laugh. "Grandpa has always favored her the most, but look at her now - she doesn't care if her actions kill him!"


"I'm sorry, but..." I said softly, my voice barely above a whisper. "I can't keep pretending anymore."

Slowly, deliberately, I lowered myself to my knees before William. The movement sent sharp pains through my stomach, but I ignored them.Taking his weathered hand in mine, I pressed my forehead against it in a gesture of deep respect.

"Thank you for everything you've done for me, William," I said slowly,feeling tears threaten. "I'll always be grateful for your kindness. Though I may no longer be part of this family, you'll forever be in my heart."

William's hand trembled in mine as Charles approached with the
medication. Without hesitation, I reached up and took the pills from the butler's hand.

"These are new," I observed, studying the tablets before popping theminto my mouth. "Fruit-flavored vitamin B complex. Larger than last time's."

The room went deadly quiet.

"How did you..." William started, then stopped as I pulled an envelope from my purse.

"Your latest health report," I said, placing it on the coffee table. "I had three different specialists review it. You're in perfect health for your age,William."


The color in William's face shifted from sickly white to embarrassed red.


"You know, William," I said softly, my lips curving into a gentle smile, "you don't have to keep up this act. No more fake heart attacks to make me stay."


"This isn't some emotional outburst or rash decision," I continued, keeping my voice level. "Ive spent a long time thinking about this. It's time to set us both free."


William seemed to age before my eyes, all pretense dropping away as he closed his eyes with a heavy sigh. "Still the same stubborn girl who walked into my grandson's hospital room three years ago, aren't you?" His voice carried a mix of fondness and resignation. "Some things never change."

When he opened his eyes again, they were suspiciously bright. "Audrey..."he paused, his voice rougher than usual. "You were everything I could have wanted in a granddaughter,"
"Maybe that's the problem," he added, shooting Blake a disappointed look."You and my grandson... perhaps it wasn't meant to be. God knows he doesn't deserve someone like you."

He reached for a tissue, his hands trembling slightly as he dabbed at his eyes. "I always imagined you'd be here, running this family when I'm too old to..."

*I'm sorry, William*, I thought,*The cancer had already decided I wouldn't be here to see anyone grow old.*

After composing himself, William fixed Blake with a hard stare. "You screwed this up, boy. The least you can do is give her the divorce she wants." His voice dropped, heavy with finality. "Let her go."


"Today," I said quickly, seizing the moment. My fingers twisted in my dress, trying to hide their trembling. "We can do it today."

I couldn't risk any delays. Not when Blake might change his mind, not when my time was running out like sand through an hourglass.


"Getting divorced today?" Laurel's voice rose with barely concealed delight before she caught herself. Her face quickly turned into one of concern. "Oh,what a terrible shame..."


"A shame?" William's laugh could have cut glass. "That's rich,coming from you. Tell me, Miss Rose, would they be signing divorce papers if you hadn't slithered back into town?"


Laurel's mask cracked as she ducked her head, one hand flying to her chest in her signature gesture of distress.

"That's enough." Blake stepped forward, his jaw tight. "Leave Laurel out of this. The divorce is between Audrey and me."
"Leave her out of it?" William's voice rose dangerously. "The woman who wormed her way back into your life and systematically destroyed your marriage? I'm showing remarkable restraint by not having Charles throw her out on her clad behind!"

He turned away from Blake in disgust. "Since you're all so eager to protect precious Miss Rose, stop wasting time and get those divorce papers signed!"

"Let Audrey be free!"
###Chapter 25: Am I Wrong?

**Blake's POV**

Grandpa's words echoed through the grand livingroom,and my jaw clenched involuntarily. Howdare he suggest I let Audrey go? After everything that had happened at his birthday celebration, after her public declaration of divorce, after that scene with James Collins-now my own grandfather was taking her side?


Before I could respond, Laurel's quiet sob drew my attention. She stood by the white marble pillar, one hand pressed delicately against it forsupport,her face a perfect picture of distress.


"It's all my fault..." Her voice trembled with carefully controlled emotion."If I had known my return would cause such damage to Blake and Audrey's marriage, I would have rather died in Europe than come back..."

I watched her dab at her eyes with a monogrammed handkerchief,something twisting uncomfortably in my chest. She looked so fragile, so genuinely remorseful. This wasn't how tonight was supposed to go.

Laurel turned toward the door, but her steps were deliberately slow,almost theatrical. "Perhaps... perhaps I should just go back to Europe..."

"Don't you dare!" Thalia's voice cut through the tension as she rushed to block Laurel's path. My sister's face was flushed with emotion, her usual composure cracking. "Three years ago when Blake was in a coma, you went to Europe for three months to help search for new treatments. Before you could even return, he married that... that country girl."

Her words hung in the air like smoke, acrid and bitter. "If you hadn't gone to Europe then, someone like *her* would never have had the chance to
marry into the Parker family!"

I saw Audrey's lips curve into a cold smile ait that.

"I'm curious, Miss Rose," she spoke up. "When you wenit to Europe seeking treatments, did you take any of Blake's medical records with you?"

The question landed like a stone in still water, ripples of tension spreading through the room. I frowned, something about her tone setting off warning bells.

"Tell me, Miss Ross." She continued."His vital signs data? Or his diagnostic reports?"

Laurel's face turned a shade paler, her composure cracking just slightly.The silence that followed was deafening.


Audrey tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, her voice carrying a deadly calm. "When Blake was in a coma three years ago, I was the one taking care of him. I worked with the nurses to monitor all his vital signs. I still have all that data saved on my laptop. But you, Miss Rose."

What Audrey said completely stunned everyone present -including me.Indeed, taking care of a vegetative patient had been no easy feat. My family members had only come to visit me in the hospital occasionally,but she had come almost every day to assist the nurses in taking care of me.I saw my mother, my sister, and even I myself unconsciously lowered my head a bit. Audrey wasn't done yet.

She took out her phone. "According to online sources. Three years ago.you joined an acting training camp the moment you arrived in Europe,spending six months on intensive drama training? I'd love to know how exactly you managed to search for treatments during that time?"
I watched Laurel's pale face, her manicured hands twisting the handkerchief. Something cold settled in my stomach as I remembered those months- the confusion of waking up from the coma, everyone telling me how Laurel had been searching for treatments while Audrey chose to take care of me in order to marry me.

Had I never questioned that story?

*Am I wrong?* No, impossible! It couldn't be that.

"Enough." My voice came out harder than intended, drawing every eye in the room. I turned to Audrey, who stood straight-backed despite everything, her chin lifted stubbornly.

She spoke up, "Fine, we should stop wasting time. Let's go to the courthouse now."


I stood motionless, watching her cold determination. Laurel approached and reached out tentatively, her hand brushing my arm. "Blake, darling...you should go with her. Make it quick." Despite her attempt to sound soft and vulnerable, I caught an undercurrent of excitement in her voice.


Audrey turned back, fixing me with an icy stare. "Well? Are you coming or not?"


Grandpa waved his hand in exasperation. "Just go. Get it over with. Let Audrey be free."


I felt my jaw clench. "I said I won't divorce her."

"Excuse me?" The surprise in her voice was genuine.

To be honest, what exactly was I thinking? Looking at the slender figure in front of me, *it shouldn't be like this.* I knew I probably didn't want to
divorce her. but that promise...

I shook my head and casually came up with an excuse. "If we divorce now,everyone wilI think Laurel destroyed our marriage." I met her gaze steadily, ignoring the way something twisted in my chest at her bitter laugh. "I won't let that happen."

"If you really cared about reputations," Grandfather's voice was filled with sarcasm. "you wouldn't have made such a show of picking;her up or taking her shopping!"

"Speaking of reputations..." Laurel's voice had regained its usual sweetness as she reached into her handbag. She pulled out a familiar-looking document that made my blood run cold.

"How did you get this?" I demanded, staring at the divorce papers in Laurel's hands. I'd meant to retrieve these documents after the gala last night,but somehow they'd ended up with her. Why had she taken them?And why hadn't she said anything until now?


Laurel bit her lip, lowering her head with practiced delicacy. "I found these divorce papers with Audrey's signature. I was worried someone might use them maliciously, so I kept them safe..."


"You mean you kept them to use yourself?" Grandfather's laugh was sharp enough to cut glass. He turned to Audrey, his expression softening in a way it never did for me anymore. "Not being able to keep you as my granddaughter-in-law... I deeply regret that."

I could see a hint of sorrow flashing on her face as she lowered her eyes."Life has its own plans, William," she said softly. "Some things just aren't meant to work out."
The words seemed to age him. He gestured to Charles, his movements carrying the weight of his years.

Once the door closed behind them, Audrey's expression hardened. She turned to me, her voice carrying an edge that could cut glass. "T'll revise the agreement, especially the clauses about Miss Rose's... involvement." Her lips curved into a cold smile. "Expect it on your desk later. Try not to misplace it this time."

The accusation in her tone made something twist in my chest. But before I could respond, she was already walking away.


"Hold it right there!" Thalia's voice cracked through the air like a whip just as Audrey reached the doorway.

"We still have some... unfinished business to discuss."

**Audrey's POV**

I stopped, raising an eyebrow as I turned. "What? Do enlighten me."


"Don't play innocent." Her voice rose with practiced outrage. "You put LaureI in the hospital last night. The least you could do is apologize."

I couldn't help but laugh when I heard Thalia's accusation.


"What do you mean? You find this funny?" Thalia's voice rose with indignation. "Laurel was injured at Grandfather's birthday celebration,and you're laughing?"


"I do, actually." I met her gaze steadily, remembering how her own hand had swung at me last night, only to catch Laurel when I dodged.

The irony of her demanding an apology for her own actions was almost
too much. "It's quite amusing that you're demanding I apologize for something I didn't do.

Rebecca stepped forward, her voice filled with arrogance. "Not you? Who else could it have been?"
###Chapter 26: Let's Examine the Evidence Fir

**Audrey's POV**

I didn't bother answering but studied Laurel's face, partially hidden behind the bandages. The placement seemed deliberate, strategic even -covering just enough to suggest injury while still allowing her to display her delicate, fragile face. A Hollywood star indeed.

"Please..." Laurel's voice trembled with practiced vulnerability as she pressed one manicured hand to her chest. "If Mrs. Parker says she didn't do it, then... let's not pursue this further. I don't want to cause any more trouble..."


I almost admired her performance, as her words and every deliberate action were implying that I was the one who slapped her last night.

"The security footage will show exactly what happened," I said, my voice steady despite theburning pain in my stomach. "Why don't we review it?"


Elizabeth cleared her throat delicately. "Actually, the surveillance system in the ballroom was turned off during the celebration. Many of New York's elite attended-they value their privacy highly."

*How convenient*, I thought,watching Thalia's momentary flash of relief.

"She's obviously lying!" Thalia's voice rose sharply, perhaps a bit too quickly. "Who else would have hit Laurel? A Hollywood star with a spotless reputation - why would anyone else attack her?"

I turned my gaze slowly from Rebecca to Laurel, my voice carrying a hint of cold amusement. "Do you really think you can freely accuse me just because there's no security footage to prove what actually happened?"
"Accuse? Look at her face!" Rebecca gestured dramatically toward Laurel."Anyway. You haveto apologize to Laurel, and we can put this unfortunate incident behind us."

I watched as Blake sighed, his brow furrowing with what looked like concern. "Laurel's health has always been delicate," he said, his voice softening in a way it never did for me anymore. "That slap was hard. Just apologize,Audrey. Why make things more difficult?"


I raised an eyebrow, meeting his dark gaze as a sardonic smile played at my lips. "Are you really going to twist the truth just to protect your precious Miss Rose?"


If Blake had actually witnessed me strike Laurel, he would have confronted me instantly - he'd never have waited for his mother and sister to play defenders of Laurel's honor. His silence now spoke volumes. He knew exactly who had struck her, but acknowledging that truth would mean disappointing his mother, sister, and most importantly, his beloved Laurel. Far easier to make me the villain of this little drama.


Perhaps I had grown too accustomed to his betrayals, because his words didn't pierce my heart the way they once would have. After years of collecting disappointments, my heart had developed quite the tolerance.

"You want an apology?" I walked deliberately toward Laurel, who shrank back against Blake's chest. "Fine. Let's examine the evidence first."

Before anyone could react, I reached out and yanked the gauze from her face. The placed bandages came away easily, revealing... a handprint.

"Interesting," I said, letting the gauze flutter to the floor. "I've lost quite a bit of weight recently. My fingers are quite thin now." I held up my palm for comparison, then gestured toward Thalia's larger hands. "This mark
clearly wasn't made by my hand. How could I possibly have made it?"

Laurel let out a theatrical gasp, burying her face in Blake's chest. "Blake,darling... she's being so cruel..."

I watched as Blake's arms came around her protectively, saw Thalia's face pale slightly as others in the room began to notice the size discrepancy.Even Elizabeth and Olivia leaned forward, their expressions shifting from disdain to uncertainty.


The familiar taste of metal filled my mouth, but I forced it back. I wasn't done yet.


"Miss Rose," I said, my voice carrying clearly across the room. "Since you seem so eager for an apology..."


Before anyone could react, I raised my hand and, channeling every ounce of strength I had left, brought it down across her face with a resounding slap. This time, there would be no question about whose handprint it was.

I could see her made-up cheek swelling visibly.

"There," I said, meeting her shocked gaze steadily. "That one was definitely from me. I'm so sorry, Miss Rose. Is that the apology you wanted?"


"Audrey!" Blake's voice thundered through the room as he pulled Laurel closer. "It was just an apology! Did you have to take it this far?"


"Blake, darling..." Laurel's voice wavered, showing her vulnerability. "It hurts so much..."


I turned away from their little tableau, the burning in my stomach intensifying. "I believe we're done here."
Parker Mansion sat in an exclusive area of the Hamptons, far from the usual taxi routes.I crouched by the roadside, staring at the rain puddles dotting the driveway. After the third failed attempt to get an Uber,I scrolled to Astrid's number.


"Can you come get me?" I asked when she answered. "I'm outside Parker Mansion."


"What?" Her voice rose with concern. "James said you were at Mayo Clinic."I was heading to the hospital to see you after work," Astrid's voice crackled with concern through the phone. "Why are you there instead?"

"Well. it's a long story. I - " The words of explanation died on my lips as the roar of an engine interrupted. My head turned instinctively toward the sound, though I already knew what I would see.

Blake's black car approached like an advancing storm. I barely had time to register his expression through the tinted windows before the vehicle tore past me, deliberately hitting the deeper puddles. The spray of muddy water completely ruined my new outfit.


I stared down at my now-soaked clothes, a wry smile tugging at my lips. *Of course.* Trust Blake Parker to take revenge for his precious Laurel in the most childishly dramatic way possible. So much for his grand speech about apologies making everything right.

*What a petty man*, I thought, brushing ineffectually at the mud stains.

**Blake's POV**

Sitting in the back seat, I was reviewing some documents when I noticed Laurel's silence. Following her gaze out the window, I saw what had caught her attention.
Audrey was crouching by the roadside, phone in one hand while the other absently pulled at some grass growing near the flower bed. She looked impossibly small there,hunched in on herself-too thin and fragile.

My chest tightened with an emotion I refused to name. The changes in her were impossible to ignore now. This wasn't the gradual weight loss of someone watching their figure. This was something else entirely.


The miscarriage, a voice whispered in my mind. But even as I thought it,it felt wrong. There was something else going on, something I was missing.



"Blake." Laurel's breathy whisper cut through my thoughts. Her lower lip trembled before she collapsed against me, one manicured hand fluttering to her throat. "Everything hurts so much..."


The familiar routine snapped me back to the present. I caught her automatically. "That bad?"


"They say about the stomach being tied to emotions. What if I never recover?"


"Hey." I gathered her closer. "Modern medicine works miracles. You'll be fine."


As I said, my fingers moved across my phone screen: [Michael- Send a car to the Parker mansion for Audrey. Get her back to home.]
###Chapter 27: I No Longer Have Feelings For Him

**Audrey's POV**

Crouching by the roadside, I absentmindedly pulled at the grass growing between the flowers in the garden bed while listening to Astrid's lecture through the phone. After what felt like an eternity, my legs grew tired and I stood up with a weary stretch.


"I've been waiting forever," I said into the phone. "When are you getting here?"


Through the phone, I could hear someone's voice: "Astrid, can you take a look at this proposal? Does this revision work?"


"Yeah, that works," Astrid responded to her colleague before returning to our conversation with an apologetic tone. "Sorry Audrey..."

"It's fine," I said gently. "You focus on your work. I'm not in a hurry."


"I really am swamped right now," Astrid sighed, "but I've arranged for a handsome guy to pick you up. He should be there any minute!"

"Handsome guy? Your new boyfriend?" I couldn't help bout tease.


"Don't joke about that!" Astrid's voice turned serious. "This guy doesn't have the slightest interest in me! You can't make jokes like that!"

Just as she finished speaking, a luxury sedan pulled up to the mansion's circular driveway, The driver's window rolled down, and I froze slightly as James Collins' face appeared behind the glass.

"Looks like he's arrived," Astrid's voice took on a teasing lilt."Now you
understand what I meant. Go on, spend some time catching up with him.You missed your chance three years ago - don't let this opportunity slip away now!"

Before I could protest, she had already hung up, leaving me to face this carefully orchestrated situation alone. My stomach churned uncomfortably,and this time it wasn't just from the illness. Trust Astrid to turn even this moment into an attempted matchmaking opportunity.


James stepped out of the car, looking every bit the successful jewelry executive in his tailored suit. "Good morning, Audrey."

I managed a poite smile, grateful that my discomfort wasn't visible. "James.You didn't have to come all this way."


"I wanted to." His voice carried that same warmth it always had, the kind that used to make my heart skip back in college. Now it just made everything more complicated. "Shall we?"

As we pulled away from the mansion, I found myself staring out the window,watching the palatial homes of the Hamptons elite roll past. I was immersed in my thoughts, remembering how I spent those boring days here.


"So," James broke the silence as we merged onto the highway. "You really told them you want a divorce?"


I nodded, keeping my eyes on the passing seenery. "I had to explain everything to William this morning. He deserved to hear it from me directly."


"William Parker..." James's voice softened slightly. "He's always been kind to you,hasn't he? Unlike the rest of them,"
"He has." The memory of William's face this morning - the hurt, the understanding, the resignation - made my chest ache. "That's why I needed to explain properly. Whatever happens with Blake and me,William will always have my respect."

James's hands tightened on the steering wheel. "And Blake? Did he even bother to make sure you had a way back to the city? Or was he too busy with his precious Laurel Rose?"

The bitterness in his voice surprised me. "James..."


"I'm serious. Audrey." His usually gentle tone had an edge I'd never heard before. "The entire Parker family was there - not one of them thought about how you'd get back? If it had been Larel stranded out here, would Blake have just driven off and left her to figure it out herself?"

"Tell me the truth, Audrey. Do you still have feelings for Blake, that jerk?"

"I no longer have feelings for him." The words came out with a calm that surprised even me. Maybe it was true what they said about reaching a point where you just couldn't hurt anymore.

James cleared his throat. "Well then, we should celebrate once the divorce is final. Let me...”


I turned to study his profile, my expression sharpening. "What exactly did Astrid tell you when she asked for this favor?"


He hesitated, caught off guard by my directness. "Just that she was swamped at work, needed someone to help..."

"It's the middle of a workday, James. Don't you have your own responsibilities?"
Taking a deep breath, I pushed forward. "Look, I appreciate your concern.but we were just senior and junior at Parsons. That doesn't warrant dropping everything to rescue me. My marriage, my divorce- those are my battles to fight."

"I don't need commentary from the sidelines."

Silence filled the car. James sat frozen, looking like I'd slapped him.


"When the divorce is final," I added, softer now, "I'm taking at least six months. No dating, no relationships, no complications."

"We need to keep our distance. For both our sakes."

I'd tried being subtle before, not wanting to hurt him when his feelings seemed genuine. But his earlier comments had crossed a line I couldn't ignore.

The color drained from his face, but after a long moment, he just nodded. "
I understand. I'm sorry,Audrey."


Something shiftedin James's expression - not quite hurt, but a sort of resigned understanding.


After a moment, he reached into his briefcase and retrieved a sleek leather portfolio. "Actually, meeting you today isn't just a favor for Astrid - it's actually my job."

I raised an eyebrow, confused,"What?"

"Remember those jewelry designs you submitted through Astrid?" He tapped the portfolio. "They landed on my boss's desk this morning. The firm's interested, but they need some market-oriented adjustments." His smile widened slightly, "Imagine my surprise when I realized who the
designer was."

The portfolio felt heavy in my hands as I flipped it open. These were definitely my sketches - the ones I'd asked Astrid to help distribute through her industry connections. After my marriage to Blake, I'd lost touch with the jewelry world, too focuised on being the decent Parker wife.Astrid, with her extensive modeling network, understood the current market far better than I did.


I almost laughed at the irony. All this time, I'd been assuming James had some ulterior motive in picking me up, when really...


"Just business," James said, reading my expression. "The review board was impressed, and that's why I'm here."


Heat crept into my cheeks as I remembered my earlier assumptions. "James,I-"


"Don't apologize," he cut in smoothly. "Did I have my own hopes in offering to pick you up? Sure. But you've made your position clear,and I respect that." His tone turned purely professional. "Let's not let personal history get in the way of what could be a solid professional partnership."

His candor made me feel small. I bit my lip, studying the portfolio's contents more closely.

"We're a design studio," James continued after a moment. "Pure creative work, no production. Would that interest you?"

"It's perfect, actually." I nodded. A design studio meant connections,expertise- everything I needed to get my work to market quickly.With my limited time...

James pulled out another document. "Good, here's to a successful
partnership. And here's your compensation package Take a look, let me know if-"


"I accept," I said, barely glancing at the numbers. "Just one condition."

"Three months." I met his questioning look. "I need mny designs on the market withinthree months."


"This timeline..." James frowned. "It's not impossible, but it won't be easy.Jewelry production and refinement takes considerable time, especially with high-end pieces."


"The board might need some convincing, but... "

"Wait!" He widened his eyes. "Three months? Is that all the time you have left?"
###Chapter 28: Negotiate With Me Directly!

**Audrey's POV**

Hearing his shaking voice, I knew something in my expression must have given me away.


The question hung in the air between us. I could see his knuckles turning white against the dark leather of the steering wheel.

"Yes." The word came out steadier than I expected.


James pulled the car over so suddenly that I had to brace myself against the dashboard. When I looked at him, his face had gone pale.


"How can it be so soon..." His voice cracked slightly. "No wonder you said you didn't want to discuss relationships. I never thought you were... God,Audrey..."


I gave a gentle smile. "Don't worry, Mayo Clinic has this experimental drug for my cancer. Dr. Evans managed to get me five doses - that's one complete course. I've already used the first one."

"And if it works well, I might get some extra time." I tried to keep my voice light. "But I'm not counting on miracles. That's why I need these designs on the market within three months, James. Can you help me with that?"


He was quiet for a long moment, staring straight ahead through the windshield. Finally, he turned to me, his expression resolute. "We'll make it happen, Audrey. Whatever it takes."

The city traffic moved around us in streams of yellow cabs and delivery trucks,life continuing its relentless pace. Just like it would after I was gone.
Thirty minutes later, standing outside Astrid's modeling agency,I watched Dr. Evans's name light up my phone screen. A week ago, she'd called me with a rare glimmer of hope- Mayo Clinic's most aggressive case of gastric cancer, she'd said, but also their first candidate for an experimental new drug. The memory of racing back from the designer gala that night,catching a red-eye flight just to sign those trial papers,still felt surreal.

I remembered Dr. Evans's face as I signed the consent forms, her quiet confidence when she assured me the hospital board had unanimously approved my participation. "As long as you can handle the cost," she'd said, "the treatment path is yours." Funny how quickly things change in the world of experimental medicine.


"Mrs. Sinclair." The hesitation in her voice was new, uncomfortable. "There's... a situation with the trial medication."

"What kind of situation?" I kept my voice steady, though my fingers tightened around the phone.

"Another patient... their boyfriend saw the press release about our experimental drug program." She paused, clearly choosing her words carefully. "Their case is less advanced than yours, but they have...significant resources. They're offering to purchase your remaining doses.Any price."

The late afternoon sun suddenly felt like a spotlight, harsh and exposing.I moved into the shadow of the building, my laugh sharp and brittle. "Let me get this straight. I've had exactly one dose, and someone's already trying to buy me out of the trial?"

"Audrey, please understand. The sample size is still extremely limited. We can't even be certain of the drug's efficacy yet..."
"So I should just step aside for someone with a bigger checkbook?" The elevator doors opened with a soft ding as I stabbed the button. "Not happening, Dr. Evans."

"The administration feels...”

"The administration is breathing down your neck, aren't they?" The edge in my voice could have cut glass. "That's why you're making this call."

Her silence was answer enough.

"Tell them this," I said, watching the floor numbers tick upward."Whatever price they're offering, I'll match it. I'll exceed it. And if Mayo Clinic tries to redistribute these drugs?" My voice dropped. "I'll make sure every newspaper in New York knows how they rank patients by their bank accounts instead of their survival chances."


I heard her sharp intake of breath. "I'll... relay your position to the board."

"One more thing." The elevator opened onto Astrid's floor. "If they're so eager to buy three months of someone else's life, tell them to come negotiate with me directly. I'd love to meet someone that desperate...or that cold."


Ending the call, I watched my hand tremble slightly as I lowered the phone. This was about survival. And I'd be damned if I'd let anyone buy my last three months out from under me.

Before I could make a move, Astrid's voice had already come over. "No, no,NO! Your walk is all wrong. This isn't a nightclub runway!"

I found her surrounded by a group of young models,all looking appropriately chastised. The scene brought back memories of our own first meeting, back when we were all so young, so full of dreams.
*"Audrey, you'll love Astrid!" Rachel's voice had been full of excitement that day. "She's so straightforward and generous!"*

*"Let's start ajewelry company together!" The three of us had been inseparable back then. "I'll handle operations, Audrey designs, Astrid models. We'll take New York by storm!"*

*"Great!" I'd been so confident at nineteen. "I'll lead us all to success!"*


*Astrid had laughed, her eyes sparkling. "Though I believe in our bright future too... by the way, Rachel, can you play with me more? Be as close to me as you are to Audrey. You even regard her as your elder sister. You can't be so biased..."*


*"All right, all right. I will. Besides, Audrey has done so many things for me. It's only natural that I see her as my elder sister." Rachel had protested.*


The memory faded as I watched Astrid dismiss her students with a final critique.


Seeing her figure, I felt quite complicated. The universe had a twisted sense of humor about those plans.


Four years ago, Rachel's accident shattered our little trinity. Her family finally decided to seek treatment abroad, and the golden trio became the surviving duo - Astrid and me, clinging to each other like survivors of a shipwreck.


And now here I was, delivering one final blow to our dreams. The thought of Astrid alone in this glittering, cutthroat world made my chest ache more than any tumor could.

"These newcomers," she sighed, dropping into her office chair. "They care
more about Instagram followers than actual skill. They think good looks are enough - they don't understand modeling requires experience,dedication."

I settled into the chair across from her desk, pulling out the divorce papers."Some lessons can only be learned with time."


"Speaking of lessons..." Her eyes fixed on the papers in my hands. "How are those coming along?"

"All done." I signed the last copy. "Can you have these delivered to Blake today?"


She was already reaching for her phone. "Consider it handled. Now..." A mischievous smile played at her lips. "Ready for something fun?"
###Chapter 29: Want to race against her?

**Audrey's POV**

The Long Island Raceway stretched out before us under the afternoon sun.the asphalt shimmering with heat. The roar of engines filled the air,bringing back memories I'd thought long buried. Astrid and I stood in our racing suits, and for a moment, I felt nineteen again.

"Remember your last timne here?" Astrid's voice was gentle.

I nodded, my throat tight. "How could I forget? Haven't touched a car since Rachel's accident."

She bumped my shoulder lightly. "I never dared bring you to places like this before. But now that you're free..." She gestured at the track. "Rachel brought us here to blow off steam, remember? It's time to remember who you were before the Parkers."

A smile tugged at my lips despite myself. "You're right."

I was a scared country girl back then, working part-time at a local clinic,until Rachel Hayes swept into my life like a whirlwind. She'd taught me everything. Then came the accident, and everything changed.

"Well, well!" A voice cut through my thoughts. "Astrid Wilson!"

Astrid and I turned toward the sound. One of the men at the center of the group was waving at us.

"Felix Thompson!" Astrid smiled warmly. "Didn't expect to see you here!"

The man nodded. "It's been a while." His gaze shifted to me in my red racing suit, and I saw his eyes widen with obvious admiration.
In the next moment, he pushed past his circle of admirers and strode toward us with confident steps, his smile bright and charming. "And who's this lovely friend you've brought?"

Astrid's lips curved into a graceful smile as she made the introductions."This is my good friend, Audrey Sinclair."


Then she turned to me with a playful wink. "And this is Felix Thompson,the Thompson family heir who just returned from his extended European studies a few days ago."


I couldn't help but recall what I knew about him - a childhood friend of Blake's, more interested in racing than academics, recently summoned home by an ultimatum from his father. The Thompson family had deep ties with Parker Group, but due to his studying abroad,he was unaware of my relationship with Blake.


"A pleasure, Miss Sinclair." His smile widened. "Though I must say, I'm surprised Astrid's kept such a lovely friend hidden away."


"Congratulations on completing your studies, Mr. Thompson," I replied diplomatically, watching embarrassment flicker across his features.


He turned to Astrid. "You've been telling tales about me, haven't you? How else would she know about that?"


"Please," Astrid laughed, "your reputation precedes you."

"My reputation?" He raised an eyebrow. "Or youar gossip?"

The banter continued as we made our way toward the track. Felix's friends had drifted closer, openly curious about the newcomer in their midst.I could feel their assessing gazes, wondering who this unknown woman was who'd caught their leader's attention.
"I haven't seen you in the New York racing circuit before," Felix said, his tone carefully casual. "Are you new to this?"

Before I could respond, Astrid jumped in. "She's a rookie. Want to race against her?"

I could see the fire in Felix's eyes. "A race? Well, we should make it interesting then." He gestured to the high-end watch on his wrist. "If you win, this is yours. If I win... you add me on Instagram. Simple enough?"

I could hear his friends muttering among themselves: "Classic Felix, asking for socials like that."

"That watch is at least several hundred thousand."


"Like any rookie's going to beat him - he spent more time racing in Europe than studying."

What they couldn't know was that their "rookie" hadonce been one of the best amateur racers in New York.


As I checked over the car Astrid had arranged, I heard Felix whisper to himself,"If she wins today, I'm definitely pursuing her."

I barely could stifle my laugh. If he only knew who I really was-the secret wife of his childhood friend.


"Get ready to be amazed," Astrid called out, helping me with the safety harness. Her eyes sparkled with mischief. "Audrey, show them what you've got!"


"It's been years," I murmured, my hands running over the familiar contours of the steering wheel. "What if I mess up?"
"You won't," she said firmly. "You were always the steady one, remember?The one Rachel and I could count on to keep us from doing anything too crazy. Even after all these years, beating Felix will be child's play."

I smiled despite my nerves. "I'll try my best."

The engine roared to life beneath me, a deep, powerful rumble that sent vibrations through my entire body. Memories flooded back - endless summer afternoons spent mastering every turn of tracks like this, the pure joy of speed and control.

Felix's car stopped beside me. Through the window, I could see his confident grin. He probably thought this would be an easy victory-a way to impress the mysterious newcomer while entertaining his friends.


The starting girl raised her flag, the setting sun catching on her sequined outfit. My world narrowed to the track ahead, everything else fading into background noise. This wasn't about Felix or his watch or even proving anything to anyone. This was about reclaiming a part of myself I'd locked away for far too long.


The flag dropped.

I hit the accelerator, feeling the car surge forward. During the whole race,I was driving by my instinct. I drifted through every bend with pinpoint accuracy,my eyes fixed on the road stretching ahead. I could hear Rachel's voice in my head, reminding me about weight transfer, about finding the perfect line.


When I crossed the finish line, several car lengths ahead of Felix, the silence was absolute. His friends stood frozen, mouths agape. Even Astrid looked slightlystunned by the margin of victory.
Felix emerged from his car slowly, running a hand through his disheveled hair. "Well," he said, walking toward me with a mix of admiration and rueful amusement, "I guess I should have known better than to trust Astrid's definition of 'rookie."

I stepped out of my car, feeling lighter than I had in years. "To be fair, it has been a long time since I raced."

"Clearly not long enough for you to forget how." He unstrapped his watch and held it out. "A deal's a deal."


"Now that's what I call putting your money where your mouth is!" She plucked the watch from Felix's outstretched hand with a theatrical flourish.
"Good to see some things about you haven't changed,Felix."

His laughter was genuine, though his eyes never left my face. I couldn't help but notice how different his attention felt from the calculating gazes I'd grown used to in New York's social circles. There was something almost refreshing about his unconcealed admiration - no hidden agendas, just pure appreciation for a skilled opponent.

"You know," I said, pulling out my phone, "Astrid wasn't entirely honest earlier. I'm hardly a rookie." I displayed my contact information with a slight smile. "Consider this a fair exchange for such an... entertaining afternoon."


The spark of interest in his eyes brightened considerably as he reached for his phone. I noticed his hands were still trembling slightly from the adrenaline of the race - or perhaps something else entirely.

"I should find Astrid," I said after we'd exchanged contacts.

"Wait!" He stopped me. "How about a photo together? To commemorate
this unexpected defeat?"

There was something genuine about his enthusiasm that made me pause.
After a moment's hesitation, I nodded.

He stepped closer, holding up his phone. The camera captured both of us.

"What are you planning to do with that photo?" I asked.


Felix's eyes sparkled with mischief as'he tucked his phone away."That's a secret."
###Chapter 30: Single or Divorced, I'm Making My Move

**Blake's POV**

I stood in Mayo Clinic's VIP wing corridor, watching through the floor-to-ceiling glass window as a nurse treated the bruising on Laurel's face. *Why did Audrey have to take things this far?* All I'd asked was a simple apology - something she'd always been willing to do these past three years.

"What's the situation with the medication?" I kept my voice low as I addressed the doctor beside me, who was reviewing his tablet with practiced detachment.


He hesitated,fidgeting with his tie. "The board has received word that the patient is... adamant about keeping all four remaining doses. They're refusing to even discuss a transfer of the medication."


I closed my eyes, my mind racing through possibilities. Parker Group had resources, connections-surely there was a way to secure those doses. After a moment, I opened my eyes again. "Continue negotiations. Tell them we're willing to pay fifty million for the remaining doses. If they still refuse,then give me-


My phone's sudden buzz cut through the conversation. Normally, I'd ignore group chat messages - they were rarely worth my time.But something made me check this one.


The photo on my screen stopped me cold. The race track stretched out in the background, but it was the figure in the foreground that demanded attention. A woman in a professional racing suit, bent over the engine of a high-performance car with practiced familiarity. Her dark hair caught the
light, her skilled movements captivating my eyes.

I would have missed it if not for Astrid Wilson's distinctive figure in the background. But once I saw her, there was no mistaking the woman in the racing suit. *Audrey.* My wife - though she seemed determined to change that status -looked so unfamiliar.


But what followed made me feel incredibly angry - another photo appeared in the group chat. This time, it was a sefie of Felix and Audrey together, both still in their racing suits, faces flushed with the excitement of competition. His arm was casually draped over her shoulder, and she was actually smiling - not the polite, reserved smile I was used to seeing, but something genuine and bright.

Before I knew it, my finger was already hitting Michael's speed dial."
What happened? Why didn't you pick her up?"

"I'm sorry, sir." My usually unflappable assistant sounded distinctly uncomfortable. "By the time our people arrived, Mrs. Parker had already left with... with Mr. Collins."


*James Collins.* The mere thought of his name made my jaw clench. After that scene at the hospital, after his self-righteous accusationsabout my treatment of Audrey, he dared to insert himself further into my marriage?And now here she was, at a race track of all places, demonstrating skills I'd never known about.


The group chat was buzzing with new messages. Felix Thompson's enthusiasm practically leaped off the screen:


"Why's everyone so quiet? Cat got your tongues? " A pause, then: "Or are you all just scared to compete for this gorgeous newcomer's attention?"
The rest of the chat remained tellingly silent. They all knew who she was -my wife, who'd publicly announced her intention to divorce me at my grandfather's birthday celebration just last night. But Felix, newly returned from Europe, was blissfully unaware of the powder keg he was dancing on.


"You sure about that?" I typed back, watching his immediate excited response.


"Of course! Blake, think I've got a shot with her?"

Something dark and possessive twisted in my chest. "Where exactly are you?"


"Long Island Raceway! Coming to join us?"

"Noted."

I ended the conversation there, my hand already reaching for my car keys.My first instinct was to drive straight to the race track, but something held me back. I wasn't particularly eager to see Audrey right now as I didn't know how to face her, and Felix's ignorance of the situation was almost amusing - once he learned who Audrey really was, all this talk of pursuit would evaporate on its own.


The realization made me change course, heading toward Parker Group instead. With everything that had happened these past few days, I'd barely had time to focus on the company.

*Business first,* I decided. *Then I'll deal with Audrey.*

I had barely settled behind my desk when a soft knock. Michael entered,holding out a thick envelope. "Sir, this just arrived from Mrs. Parker."

The revised divorce agreement.
I took it without comment, flipping through the pages. Followving our confrontation at the mansion. Audrey had removed all mentions of Laurel from the divorce agreement. Everything else remained largely unchanged.She was walking away with nothing, claiming none of our shared assets-just custody of Snow, our Ragdoll cat.

The irony wasn't lost on me. Three years of marriage reduced to a dispute over a cat I'd given her for our first anniversary. The same cat she'd spent countless nights cuddling while I worked late. *Was that all our marriage meant to her now? Less important than a pet?*

My phone lit up again - more photos from Felix. Audrey was in the driver s seat, sharing a laugh with Astrid. She looked... different. Not the carefully composed Mrs. Parker who'd spent years trying to please everyone in my family. This woman wore confidence like a second skin,her smile genuine in a way I hadn't seen in too long.


"I think you better check her Background." Alex Rhodes' message popped up, a warning to Felix that came far too late.


The excitement of encountering a mysterious beauty at the track, combined with getting my rare attention in the group chat, seemed to have gone straight to his head, so Felix's response was almost immediate: "No need, I don't care about her past. Single or divorced, I'm making my move!"

*Making his move?* The words sent a surge of cold anger through my veins. She was still my wife, regardless of whatever games she was playing with those divorce papers. The thought of Felix Thompson, of all people,pursuing her...

At that moment, Laurel called. "Blake, darling..." Her voice carried that particular note of vulnerability she'd perfected."I'm feeling better, but...lonely. Could we go somewhere? Just to get my mind off things?"
I stared at the divorce papers on my desk, at Felix's latest photo of Audrey commanding the race track like she d been born to it. The woman in those phots was a stranger to me -fierce, independent, refusing to play by the roles I'd alwnys assumed we both understood.

My decision crystallized with surprising clarity. "Tll pick you up." I said.atready reaching for my keys. "We're going to the race track."
###Chapter 31: Since When Did You Dislike Racing?

**Audrey's POV**

I adjusted the rearview mirror, noting only two cars remaining behind me.This was the fifth round of the day - our original field of over a dozen racers had narrowed to just three: myself, Felix Thompson, and another driver whose name I hadn't caught.

"Last turn," I whispered to myself. easing onto the gas. Everything crystallized in that moment of cornering. I could feel every fraction of grip between tire and asphalt, every degree of the car's tilt.

Cheers erupted as I crossed the finish line. I pulled off my helmet,catching sight of Astrid jumping up and down by the checkered flag.Moments later, Felix's car rolled to a stop beside mine. His smile was brighter than the summer sun as he climbed out.

"Another win!" He removed his helmet, offering me a bottle of water."Ready for round six?"


I accepted the water, noting the natural grace in his movements.

"Of course!" Astrid's voice bubbled with excitement."I've lost plenty here over the years - but with my best friend back, I'm winning everything back today!" Her eyes sparkled as she spoke.


A skeptical voice cut through the crowd: "Miss Wilson, is she really just your friend? Or did you hire a professional to help recoup your losses?"

I felt Astrid tense beside me, ready to snap back, but Felix beat her to it.
"Audrey's skill might match a professional's," he said, his defense surprising me, "but you can see she's unfamiliar with the track. She hasn't raced in years. Less professional racer, more retired prodigy.Right. Audrey?1


The whispers started immediately:

"Ooh,first-name basis already? Getting cozy, aren't we?"

"The Thompson heir's European charm showing through!"

"Should we start calling her Mrs. Thompson?"

Felix's face flushed slightly. "They're just joking," he said quickly. "Don't mind them."

I calmly screwed the cap back on my water bottle, my gaze steady. "I won't mind. However... linking an eligible bachelor like Mr. Thompson with a
recently divorced woman like myself isn't quite appropriate."

The silence that followed was absolute. Even the wind seemedto hold its breath. Every face around us registered shock, including Felix's. He looked like someone had just thrown ice water in his face.

"Why bring up divorce now?" Astrid sighed, "Such bad luck."

I smiled faintly. "Better to say it now than have people discover it later and embarrass Mr. Thompson," I patted his shoulder and headed back to my car.

As I slid into the driver's seat, I caught Felix still standing there, his expression a complex mix of emotions. Sorry, Mr. Thompson. Some things are better made clear from the start.
"Round six!" I called out, letting the engine's roar punctuate my words.The savage growl of the engine matched the wild freedom surging through my veins. For once, I didn't care about maintaining the perfect image.Today,just for these precious moments on the track, I would let myself be free.

My foot pressed down on the accelerator. The world blurred into streaks of color and light as the car leaped forward, carrying with it all the passion and skill I'd buried for so long.


**Blake's POV**

The changing room door had barely closed when Laurel's discomfort became apparent. One hand shielding her eyes from the sun, the other clinging to my arm. "Blake, darling, it's too noisy here. I don't like this atmosphere... couldn't we go somewhere quieter?"

I frowned. Rachel's words from five years ago suddenly echoed in my mind. Back when my injury kept me from racing, she'd mentioned her sister's racing prowess.

"I remember Rachel, your sister, saying you loved racing," I watched her face carefully, "that your skills rivaled professionals. Since when did you dislike racing?”

Laurel's face darkened for a moment, panic flashing across her features.But she quickly recovered, arranging her expression into a regretful smile."Yes... well. I did... I did love racing before, but... Blake, darling, you know I was very ill.., many things changed after that, don't you remember?"

She tightened her grip on my arm. "But... if you like it here, if you want to race and relax, I can stay and cheer for you! Men who race are quite attractive,"
Watching her put on that sweet smile, trying so hard to look stunning -just like she does in front of the camera, I only felt the confusion inside me growing deeper. "Five years ago. I told you I personally don't enjoy such extreme sports due to my disabled body!.. did you forget that?"

Memories seeped into my mind, taking me back to that time five years ago.After the accident that left me temporarily blind, I was rescued by a kind woman in that small village - the woman I believed to be Laurel. Rachel had been there too, witnessing everything. During those peaceful days of recovery, while that mysterious savior tenderly cared for my injuries,Rachel would spend hours by my bedside, telling me stories about her sister.


"You should see her on the track, Blake," she'd gushed, her voice filled with pride. "Like a professional - the way she handles those turns, it's something else." Those conversations became my window to the world during those dark days, painting vivid pictures in my sightless mind of Laurel's supposed racing prowess.


I'd used my injury as an excuse then, claiming extreme sports weren't mny thing. What else could I say? My doctors had made it clear I'd never race again.


Now here we were, finally at the track, and Laurel wasn't just showing zero interest-she was suggesting that I, with my history of injuries,should be the one racing? To impress her?


The woman beside me seemed a far cry from the fearless racer Rachel had described. Either Rachel had been wildly exaggerating, or...

Laurel suddenly froze beside me. Following her gaze, I felt myself go still as well.
By the pit lane, Audrey, my wife, was there with Felix Thompson and Astrid Wilson. I watched as she laughed with Felix, playfully tugging his ear. This vibrant version of Audrey was a stranger to me.

In three years of marriage, I'd never seen this side of her- sunny,radiant,and alive. Was it because of me that she had hidden her glamorous side?


"She..." Laurel's voice shook with shock. "How can she..."

I didn't respond. In that moment, I realized how little I knew about the woman who'd been my wife for three years. A question began forming in my mind: Did I ever really know her? Or had I never even tried?

"Blake!" Felix's voice sounded.
###Chapter 32: What A Bad Luck

**Audrey's POV**

Felix turned quite excited. "You won't believe who's here!" His grip on my wrist was surprisingly strong as he tugged me forward. "Come on,let me introduce you to my childhood best friend!"

I was still riding the high, the thrill of racing pulsing through my veins.Even Astrid seemed caught up in the moment, letting Felix pull her along too.But as we approached the entrance, everything changed.

Blake Parker stood there, his tall frame unmistakable even at a distance.What stopped me cold wasn't his presence - I'd half expected him to show up after Felix's messages. No, it was the sight of Laurel Rose wrapped in his arms, her head tucked perfectly against his chest.

I yanked my hand free from Felix's grip, taking an instinctive step backward. Beside me, Astrid made a sound of disgust.

"What a bad luck," she muttered, loud enough for Felix to hear. "Running into them here."


Felix's eager smile froze. "You... have some history with Mr. Parker and Miss Rose?"


Astrid let out a cold laugh. "History? That doesn't begin to cover it! I tell you-"


Before she finished. "Felix." Blake cut through, his voice carrying that particular note of polite distance as he walked towards us. Then his gaze landed on Astrid and me, his expression hardening."What brings you here?"
Before I could respond, Astrid stepped partially in front of me. "Any problem? I wasn't aware Long Island Raceway had your name on the deed,Mr.Parker."

The corner of his mouth twitched, probably due to annoyance or amusement. "Since when do you race?" His tone carried that familiar edge of condescension that never failed to get under my skin.


I had intended to walk away. Really. I had. But something about his tone,that implicit judgment that I couldn't possibly know anything about this world of his...

"I learned many years ago," I said, keeping my voice deliberately neutral.

"Really?" His eyebrows rose slightly. "I wasn't aware they had facilities for that sort of thing in the countryside.

The old pain flared - not at the insult itself, but at how easily he still fell into these patterns. How readily he reached for my background as a weapon.


"I suppose growing up in the country means I must be completely ignorant and uncultured?" I met his gaze steadily. "Is that what you're implying,Mr.Parker?"

"Just curious," he said, but his eyes had that dangerous glint I remembered too well.

"Perhaps Mr. Parker should focus his curiosity elsewhere. Some things aren't worth your precious time."


"You... know each other?" Felix's voice carried a note of dawning realization.
I could almost laugh at Felix's shocked expression. His eyes darted between Blake and me, clearly struggling to process what he was witnessing. After all, Blake Parker was New York's golden boy. No one in our circles would dare speak to him with such blatant disregard for his status.


Yet here I was, not only talking back but delivering a string of retorts as if he were any other entitled rich boy at the track. The most intriguing part?Despite his dark expression, I could tell he wasn't truly angry. Three years of marriage had taught me to read the subtle tightening around his eyes,the almost imperceptible clench of his jaw. This wasn't his fury- this was something else entirely.


"Mr. Parker and I were once acquainted. We're not anymore. It's that simple." I turned back to my race car, letting the familiar scent of rubber and engine oil ground me.

"Miss Sinclair." Laurel's voice floated across the space between us, honey-sweet and calculatedly gentle. The Hollywood star was playing her favorite role-the gracious peacemaker. "Even if there's been some unpleasantness between us, we should maintain basic social etiquette. Let's not hold onto past grievances."

I spared her the briefest glance, the kind you'd give to someone who'd completely lost touch with reality, before settling back into my driver's seat.
From my position in the driver's seat, I divided my attention between the mechanics' engine analysis and the scene playing out in my peripheral vision. Blake and Laurel still stood together- New York's power couple,exactly as she'd always dreamed they would be.

Something caught my attention, though. A subtle detail that spoke volumes. In the past, Laurel had always made a point of addressing me as
"Mrs. Parker" at every social gathering, every charity gala,every Parker family event. She'd wield the title like a reminder that she considered my position temporary.

Now, suddenly, I was "Miss Sinclair."

*Is this it?* I wondered. *Is this her way of declaring my marriage to Blake officially over?*

My foot found the gas pedal almost instinctively. Once the maintenance crew finished their work, I'd take a few victory laps. Not to show off, but to celebrate. After all, some endings deserved to be marked with the roar of an engine and the thrill of speed.

**Blake's POV**

"Laurel." I watched Audrey settle into her race car before turning to the woman beside me. "Would you like to do a few laps?"

"Does Miss Rose race too?" Astrid's voice carried a mocking undertone.Her eyes gleamed with a dangerous light I recognized all too well. "Why don't we make this interesting? A race between her and Audrey? Mr.Parker and I could place a little wager."


I caught the flash of panic in Laurel's eyes as she started to protest. "No, I..



Before she could finish, I draped my arm across her shoulders, meeting Astrid's challenge with a cold smile. "What are we betting?"

Laurel's eyes widened as she turned to me. "Blake, darling..."

"Laurel." I frowned slightly, keeping my voice gentle. "Remember what the doctor said? You need activities you enjoy to help with your anxiety.
Racng used to be your passion, your specialty."

My gaze drifted to where Audrey sat in her car, scrolling through her phone with apparent disinterest. A familiar irritation stirred in my chest."She might know how to drive, but she's clearly an amateur."

After all, what could someone from her background possibly know about professional racing? Even if she'd learned recently, she couldn't possibly match Laurel's supposed expertise.


I watched Laurel's face cycle through various emotions as she processed my words. Something about her expression seemed off, but before I could analyze it further, Astrid chimed in.


"Oh yes, Audrey's quite the amateur," she agreed, her tone dripping with barely concealed amusement. "Surely a professional like Miss Rose would have no trouble winning. Right?"


Color flooded Laurel's cheeks as she glanced between me and Audrey.I could see her struggling with some internal debate. Finally, after casting a long look at Audrey - who was still absorbed in her phone, her brow furrowed in what appeared to be genuine concern-Laurel straightened her shoulders.


"I'll race her," she declared, with more bravado than I'd expected.

Astrid's face lit up with triumph. "Excellent! I'll go discuss terms with Audrey. You two can decide what you want if she loses."

As Astrid walked away, I turned to Laurel. "Don't make the stakes too high."

She glanced in Audrey's direction, a small smile playing at her lips. "Don't worry, darling. I won't be too harsh."
###Chapter 33: Fifty Million... Or Goodbye New York!

**Audrey's POV**

Sitting in my race car, I should have been preparing for my next round,but my attention was locked on Dr. Evans's message lighting up my phone screen.

*Fifty million dollars.*

The numbers seemed to mock me as I read the message again: "Mrs.Parker, they're offering fifty million for the remaining doses. If you can match that amount, they'll withdraw their request. Would that be acceptable?"


A bitter laugh escaped my lips before I could stop it. Fifty million might be pocket change for Blake Parker, something he could produce without a second thought. While I had saved some money these past years as his secret wife, it was nowhere near that astronomical figure. Perhaps fate was telling me it was time to stop fighting, to accept my limited time...


"Audrey!" Astrid's voice cut through my dark thoughts as she bounded over to my car, her face flushed with excitement.

I quickly locked my phone screen, forcing a smile. "What's up?"

"Blake wants Laurel to race against you." She leaned against my car door,her eyes sparkling with mischief. "They haven't set the stakes yet."

The mention of Blake and Laurel sent a familiar ache through my chest,but I kept my expression neutral.
"Since you won't get much in the divorce," Astrid continued, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper, "why not take him for all he's worth?How about ten million? He's loaded anyway."


Maybe it was the lingering shock from Dr. Evans's message, or perhaps the absurdity of the situation, but something made me say, "Ten million isn't enough. Why not fifty million?"


I meant it as a joke, a bitter reference to the sum I so desperately needed but couldn't hope to obtain. But Astrid's eyes lit up in a way that made my stomach drop.

"Fifty million..." Her grin turned predatory. "Perfect! Fifty million it is!"


"I was joking, don't...” I tried to grab her arm, but she was already racing across the track toward where Blake stood with Laurel.

*What have I done?*

I climbed out of the car, and quickly caught up with Astrid.


Before I could hold her back. "We've decided," Astrid's voice rang out with a tone of determination. "If you lose, you pay Audrey fifty million. Dare to race?"


"Fifty million?" Blake froze for a moment,a puzzled expression clouding his features. His gaze shifted restlessly between me and Astrid. "Was this your idea, or did Audrey put you up to it?"


Astrid, not bothering to entertain his question, shot back curtly, "That's not your concern. All I need is a simple yes or no."

Laurel's perfect mask slipped for just a moment before she recovered,her smile turning sharp.
"Miss Sinclair," she stepped forward, her words a deceptive blend of sweetness and hidden malice. "no need to be nervous. I understand your humble background means you don't have such money."

She paused for effect, making sure she had everyone's attention. "If I lose,Blake will pay you fifty million as agreed. If you lose..." Her smile widened. "Well, Miss Sinclair, you'll leave New York immediately and never show your face to Blake and me again. Can you do that?"


The time froze instantly. I could feel shocked stares darting between Laurel,Blake, and me, clearly sensing the explosive tension crackling in the air between us.


I just found her condition quite ironic. In three months, I'd be gone anyway- whether from New York or from this world entirely. What did I have to lose?


"Gladly,"·I replied, my voice steady despite the churning in my stomach.

"Exactly!" Astrid jumped in, her protective instincts flaring. "You think Audrey enjoys seeing you two?"


I caught Blake's expression darkening at our exchange, saw the muscle jumping in his jaw. But for once, I didn't care about his reaction.The medication I needed to survive cost fifty million dollars. If I won this race,I'd have that exact amount. If I lost... well, I'd be leaving New York one way or another.


*Sometimes fate has a twisted sense of humor,* I thought,watching Laurel's triumphant smile. *Let's see who gets the last laugh.*

**Blake's POV**

I watched the scene unfold, something dark and uncomfortable twisting in
my chest. This wasn't how I'd expected the morning to go. The sight of Audrey in her racing suit, commanding the track like she'd been born to it,had already thrown me off balance. Now this?

"How did you come up with such stakes?" I kept my voice low as I turned to Laurel, my thoughts drifting to Audrey's situation. The Sinclairs might live in their Upper East Side mansion, but they had made it crystal clear they preferred their adopted daughter. Their biological child meant nothing to them. Without the Parker family's support these past years,Audrey would have faced a much harsher reality in New York.


Now watching Laurel's confident smirk as she issued her challenge,knowing she was sure to win any race, something cold settled in my chest.This wasn't just about racing anymore.

"Blake, darling." Laurel's soft voice pulled me from my thoughts as she leaned close, her lips curved into that practiced smile she'd perfected in Hollywood. "I'm just having a little fun with sister-in-law."

Her fingers brushed my arm in that deliberately casual way of hers. "Even if she loses, I won't really make her leave New York." A pause, then with perfect calculated innocence: "I just want her to take this race seriously."

Her eyes met mine, wide and earnest. "You know how much she cares about you.How could she possibly bear to leave New York and never see you again? She'll give everything she has to win against me."


The tension in my shoulders eased slightly at her explanation, though something still felt off. My gaze drifted to Audrey. She was sitting on the sofa in the prep area, her back straight and her gaze fixed intently on the racetrack.


"Blake..." Felix's uncertain voice cut through my observation.He seemed
almost dizzy trying to process the scene unfolding before him.

He gestured for one of the track assistants to hep Laurel select her car,then turned to me with that eager-to-please expression I remembered from our school days. Guiding me toward the front row of the spectator stands,he attempted to smooth things over.

"Come on, Astrid and Audrey must be kidding about those stakes."He gave a nervous laugh. "If they win... look, just throw them a million. That's like pocket change for you, right? No need to make this complicated."

I turned my full attention to him, letting my displeasure show. "You can make decisions for them? Are you that close?"

Felix swallowed hard but pressed on. "I mentioned in the group chat, I'm planning to pursue Audrey."


"Don't bother." The words came out colder than I intended, but I couldn't bring myself to care. "Give up that idea now."

"Blake, that's not fair, I think I..."

"Get ready, ladies! Next is the warm-up lap. Please board your cars!" The announcer's voice cut through our conversation, saving Felix from whatever he'd been about to say.
###Chapter 34: I Look Forward to Attending Yar Wedding
Audrey's POV
Through the reinforced windshield, I could see Laurel Rose in her vehicle, her perfectly manicured hands gripping the steering wheel with visible tension. The contrast between her current nervousness and her earlier bravado was stark.
Just minutes ago, she had cornered me in the prep area. "After you lose today," she’d said, her voice dropping to a low, icy frequency, "you’ll finally have to accept that Blake has moved on."
I’d simply adjusted my racing gloves, a small, knowing smile playing on my lips. "Does he tell you that, Miss Rose? Or are you just trying to convince yourself?"
Her eyes had narrowed. "Since I returned, we’ve been inseparable. I know exactly where his priorities lie."
"Well then," I replied, meeting her gaze steadily. "Since you have his ear, why don't you convince him to finally sign our divorce papers? I truly look forward to attending your wedding—as an invited guest, of course."
Now, the starting lights for the warm-up lap flashed red against the morning sky. Everything else faded as I focused on the track ahead. The lights went dark, my foot found the accelerator, and my car shot forward like an arrow.
Blake's POV
The world seemed to sharpen as Audrey's car tore past the start line. For a moment, I forgot my supposed role as Laurel’s supporter.
Audrey was breathtaking on the track—confident, precise, and flamboyant. She was a far cry from the woman who had spent years quietly managing our household.
"Blake..." Felix’s hesitant voice broke my concentration. "We should stop this. Laurel clearly isn't prepared for this level of competition."
He was right. Turning my attention to Laurel’s car, I watched her struggle. She had strayed off the racing line multiple times in the warm-up alone. Her movements were jerky, betraying a complete lack of experience.
Something didn't add up. Rachel had once told me her sister was a natural on the track. If Laurel was that sister, why did she look like she’d barely had a lesson?
The real race began.
Audrey’s car shot forward with perfect timing. Laurel’s vehicle lurched awkwardly, nearly stalling. The difference in skill was painful to watch. Audrey was already finishing her third circuit while Laurel struggled through her first. I could hear Astrid Wilson’s voice rising above the cheers, her excitement for Audrey palpable.
But then, something shifted. On the approach to the final turn, I saw Audrey slow down. Was she trying to humiliate Laurel by lingering, or was she attempting to give her space to finish with some dignity? Given Audrey’s nature, I suspected the latter.
Suddenly, Laurel’s car seemed to lose its trajectory. It lurched forward, crossing into Audrey’s path at an unstable angle.
The sound of screeching tires and grinding metal echoed through the stands. Gasps and screams erupted from the crowd. Audrey’s car had been forced into the barriers.
I instinctively stood up, my heart hammering. Astrid and Felix were already sprinting toward the wreckage. I squinted, my gaze lingering on Audrey's car for a split second longer than it should have, before I forced myself to walk toward Laurel. As her public partner, I was the only one who could provide her with the appearance of support, even if my mind was elsewhere.
Audrey's POV
It took one lap to see the truth: Laurel might be Hollywood’s darling, but she was no racer. The way she fumbled with the gear shifts made me wonder if she’d only been given a crash course an hour before.
What were you thinking, Blake? To put a novice on a high-speed track was a disaster waiting to happen.
Some petty part of me wanted to win by a landslide to show the world exactly how outclassed she was. But five years away from the sport hadn't erased the sportsmanship Rachel had instilled in me. When you are vastly superior to your opponent, you don't crush them; you show them the courtesy of the road.
I lifted my foot off the gas. I had already lapped her twice; letting her pass me once wouldn't change the outcome of the race. It would give her a small victory to save face.
But as I rounded the final bend, I saw her car swerve. Whether it was a loss of control or a desperate attempt to catch up, her vehicle veered sharply toward mine.
The realization hit me too late. Metal groaned against metal as the impact sent both vehicles into a violent spin. The world turned into a chaotic blur of noise and heat. Through the windshield, I saw the sky and the asphalt trade places as we careened toward the barriers.
Everything faded into a dull, throbbing pain as the world went silent.

###Chapter 35:Are You Hurt?
Audrey's POV
When the world stopped spinning, a heavy silence filled the cabin. Through the fractured glass of the windshield, I saw blurry figures running toward the wreckage. Astrid and Felix were in the lead, their faces etched with frantic concern.
"Audrey!" Astrid’s voice broke through the ringing in my ears. "Can you hear me? Please, tell me you’re okay!"
But another voice cut through the chaos first—one that was sharper, filled with a frantic energy I hadn't heard in years. "How could you be so reckless? Are you hurt?"
For a fleeting second, my heart skipped a beat. The concern in Blake’s tone was so familiar, so visceral. But as my vision cleared, the cold truth settled in. He wasn't looking at me. He didn't even glance at my crumpled car as he sprinted past, heading straight for Laurel’s vehicle.
A hollow smile touched my lips. How predictable. Even now, after she had lost control and forced us both off the track, his world still revolved around her.
"Audrey, look at me!" Astrid was at my window, her face pale.
"I'm fine," I managed to say, though my voice was raspy. I tried to move, feeling the dull ache of the impact, but no sharp pain followed.
"That was completely unacceptable!" Astrid’s eyes were bright with fury. "She cut across the line on purpose—we all saw it!"
"Can you move your hands?" Felix asked urgently, reaching through the door to assist me. "Any dizziness?"
Beyond them, I caught Blake’s eye for a fraction of a second. He was lifting Laurel from her seat with exquisite care, cradling her as if she were made of the finest porcelain. She leaned her head against his shoulder, looking every bit the delicate victim. The scene was perfectly composed, yet it made my chest ache with a pain far worse than any concussion.
"Unbelievable," Astrid whispered, her voice trembling with rage. "He doesn't even see you, Audrey. You're his wife, and he's carrying her off like she's the only one who matters."
A paramedic arrived, and they carefully moved me onto a stretcher. I watched Felix stare at Blake’s retreating back, his expression shifting from confusion to a dawning, terrible realization.
"Wait..." Felix turned to Astrid, his voice low. "You mean... Audrey is Blake’s wife?"
"For now," Astrid replied bitterly. "Though he seems more interested in protecting his public 'partner' than his own family."

The hospital check-up was mercifully brief.
"A mild concussion and some bruising," the doctor announced. "You were very lucky, Mrs. Parker. The safety cell of the car did its job."
Astrid, who had been pacing the room like a caged tiger, finally sat beside my bed. "You scared me to death, Audrey! I never should have let you get on that track with an amateur like her. Fifty million isn't worth your life."
"It's over now, Astrid," I said softly, though the mention of our late friend Rachel made my throat tighten. Astrid saw the shadow in my eyes and pulled me into a fierce hug. She didn't know that in three months, no doctor would be able to give me a clean bill of health.
"It wasn't just an accident," Felix said, leaning against the wall with a grim expression. "Laurel’s conduct was beyond reckless. In a professional setting, this would lead to a permanent ban. We have the footage, Audrey."
"Exactly!" Astrid’s eyes lit up. "Blake has been dragging his feet on the divorce, right? Use this! Tell him if he doesn't sign the papers and let you go, we’ll release the footage of the 'Golden Girl' causing a high-speed collision. Her career wouldn't survive the scandal, and he knows it."
I stared at the ceiling, the idea taking root. It was a cold, calculated move—the kind Blake would use. Using his need to protect Laurel as leverage to gain my freedom was a bitter irony. Three years of trying to be the perfect wife, all leading to a negotiation over a crash.
A knock at the door interrupted my thoughts. Michael, Blake’s lead assistant, stood there with an uncharacteristically awkward expression.
"Mrs. Parker," he said, clearing his throat. "Mr. Parker... is asking to see you."

###Chapter 36: You Are Rather Difficult to Reach

**Audrey's POV**

"Mrs. Parker? She's Sinclair! Audrey Sinclair!" Astrid shot up from her chair with a scoff. "Blake Parker and Laurel Rose are in this hospital too,aren't they?"


She moved toward Michael, protective anger radiating from her every movement. "Audrey's injured. Whatever they have to say can go through me!"


"Miss Wilson." Michael positioned himself carefully in the doorway,his normally composed expression showing a hint of strain. "Please understand, that wouldn't be appropriate." He shifted his attention to me,his voice softening slightly. "Mrs. Parker, Mr. Parker requests your presence. He suggests that if you want the divorce proceedings to move forward smoothly..."


The implied threat hung heavy in the air, unspoken but clear. I stared at my hands for a moment, feeling the familiar throb at my temples intensify.Of course he would use the divorce as leverage - it was so perfectly,predictably Blake.

I gave a bitter smile as I tried to push myself up from the bed.

"Here, let me help." Felix was at my side before I could process his movement, one hand extended in support.

I leaned away from his offered assistance, managing what I hoped was a reassuring smile. "Thanks, I can manage."
"I could come with you," he offered, dropping his hand but hovering uncertainly.

"That's not necessary." I kept my voice gențle but firmn. "I can't let Blake hold a grudge against the Thompson famnily."

The flash of frustration across his features told me he wanted to argue, but years of social training kept him silent. In any other circumstance, his chivalrous instincts might have been endearing.

Astrid wasn't so easily deterred. She was at my side in an instant,her presence both comforting and concerning. "I'm coming with you."

"No." I carefully extracted myself from her protective stance."Wait here."


"Audrey-"

"Please." I cut off her protest with a look we both understood. Her quick temper combined with Blake's arrogance and Laurel's manipulations would be explosive. The last thing I needed was a scene in the hospital corridors.


She pressed her lips together, clearly unhappy but understanding. "Fine.
But keep your phone close. One call - that's all it'll take, and I'll be there."

Her fierce loyalty almost made me smile. Almost.

I turned to Michael, straightening my spine despite the protest from my injuries. "Lead the way, Mr. Chen."

The journey to the VIP floor felt endless. Michael maintained a respectful silence as we navigated the hospital's maze of corridors and elevators.Other patients and staff came and went, each floor we passed marking another step up the hospital's unspoken hierarchy.
"Mrs. Parker," Michael finally ventured as we approached yet another elevator. "You sure you're alright?"

"I'm fine." The lie came easily after three years of marriage to Blake.Always fine, always composed, always the perfect Mrs. Parker - even when my world was crumbling around me.

"And Miss Rose?" I couldn't help asking. "Is she injured?"

Michael's slight hesitation spoke volumes. "Miss Rose is... it's complicated."


We were still several feet from the suite when Laurel's voice drifted through the partially open door, perfectly modulated for maximum dramatic effect.

"Blake darling, what if I don't make it?" Her voice quavered with precisely calculated fear. "When I was on the track, I actually thought about writing my will!"

"Don't talk like that." Blake's response was gentle, filled with the tenderness he'd never shown me. "You'll live a long, healthy life..."


"But we need to do everything we want to do, right away!" Laurel's voice rose and fell in perfect theatrical rhythm. "Promise me you'll be there,Blake..."


Hearing her words, I just felt incredibly disgusted. Even I could see through her calculated performance, yet Blake, who prided himself on seeing through things, was completely taken in.

Michael cleared his throat awkwardly, rising his voice. "Mrs. Parker, are you absolutely sure you have no other injuries?"

"Thank you for your concern," I replied, loud enough to be heard inside
the room. "I'm fine."

The scene that greeted us could have been lifted straight from a daytime soap opera. Laurel reclined against a mountain of pillows, her designer hospital gown arranged just so, while Blake sat beside her, peeling an apple with devoted concentration. Their clothing was subtly disheveled -not enough to be improper, but just enough to suggest intimate comfort.

"Well, well." Laurel's eyes found me immediately, her smile razor-sharp."Mr. Chen took quite a while to fetch you, Miss Sinclair. You're rather difficult to reach these days."

Once again, she called me "Miss Sinclair" - the implications couldn't have been clearer. In her mind, she was already Mrs. Parker.

"The distance between floors accounted for the delay." I kept my voice calm, refusing to engage with her performance.

Her expression shifted instantly, vulnerability showing up. "Blake darling...
"Her lower lip trembled as she turned to him. "What is she implying?
That you're playing favorites with the hospital rooms?"

"I never said that," I replied evenly.

"You didn't have to." Her voice sounded sweet but was full of spite. "Blake darling, I told you I didn't need the VIP suite. I'm not some princess...you insisted." She cast a pointed look at me. "And now Miss Sinclair comes in here, making snide remarks..."

I watched as Blake tensed, his hand tightening around the half-peeled apple. "Stop making a fuss," he said to me, his voice cold."Laurel's injuries are more severe. That's why she's here. If you were actually ill, I would arrange that too,"
Looking at him, I felt a wave of coldness wash over me. The man I had once loved was taciturn, sharp-witted, calm, and unruly. Even when he was blind, he could judge a person's character and qualities based on just a few words. But now, with his clear eyes, He seemed worse off than if he were blind and deaf, believing every word Laurel said.

*Some people*, I thought with bitter clarity, *regain their sight only to become truly blind.*

"Is that why you had Mr. Chen threaten me with the divorce?" I asked quietly. "To bring me here for this performance?"

"I've heard enough." I straightened my spine, ignoring the pain that shot through my body. "If there's nothing else, I'lI return to my rest. Remember to transfer the fifty million from our bet to my account, and I hope to see you tomorrow at the court."

"Audrey·Sinclair!" Blake's voice cracked like a whip. "After what you did to Laurel on the track, don't you think you owe her an apology?"


"Blake darling, let it go." Laurel's voice softened with practiced vulnerability. "Miss Sinclair won't apologize. She won't admit that she deliberately slowed down to make me crash..."


I stared at her, momentarily stunned by the sheer audacity of her lie. The truth - that she had deliberately rammed my car when I slowed to give her space -felt suddenly irrelevant. Blake would believe whatever version of reality Laurel chose to present.

"I won't force her to apologize," Laurel continued, her voice thick with unshed tears. "My feelings don't matter... I'll just cry it out..."

The apple slipped from her perfectly manicured fingers, hitting the floor
with a soft thud. She burst into tears, her body trembling as she pressed one hand to her chest, nearly swooning against the headboard in an impeccably executed display of distress.

"Laurel!" Blake hugged her instantly while comforting her.

His eyes, when they turned to me, blazed with fury. "Apologize to her.Now!"
###Chapter 37: He Wants to Meet You

**Audrey's POV**

Lookingat the couple before me, I knew I should be feeling heartbroken,upset, or even furious right now.

But perhaps because I no longer held any expectations for Blake Parker,my heart had grown completely numb, devoid of any emotion.

"Blake darling..." After crying for a while, Laurel seemed to notice I had no intention of apologizing. She shifted in Blake's arms, pretending to have recovered somewhat, and buried herself deeper into his chest with practiced vulnerability. "Don't be too hard on Miss Sinclair."


"Miss Sinclair," she turned to me with perfectly calculated distress in her voice. "I know you've always had something against me..."


"Blake and I, there's really nothing between us..." As she spoke these words, she deliberately pressed herself closer to Blake, her body language completely contradicting her statement.


A cold smile touched my lips. "Miss Rose, you're clinging to my husband while we're still legally married, yet you claim there's nothing between you?11


Her face turned pale instantly. She quickly released Blake, but tears had already started flowing down her cheeks, "Miss Sinclair, please don't think that way, Blake and I..."


"I only see her asa sister," Blake cut in, his voice hard and cold. "Stop making things so complicated."

"Whatever is between you two," I said, surprised by the steadiness in my
voice, "I stopped caring long ago." I met his gaze directly. "Blake, just sign the papers, okay? That's the best thing you can do. See you at the court tomorrow."

I could see his jaw tightened - a tell I'd learned to recognize during our marriage. He was angry, but more than that, he was caught off guard.Good.

"And don't forget," I added as I turned to leave, "the racetrack's security footage will show exactly what happened today. You might want to review it before demanding any more apologies." I paused at the door. "Oh, and the fifty million dollars from our bet - I'll expect that in my account before the divorce proceedings."

I made it halfway down the corridor before the pain hit. My stomach cramped violently, forcing me to lean against the wall. Through the partially open door of the suite, I could hear Laurel's voice, perfectly pitched to carry:

"Blake darling, how dare she speak to us that way!"

"Why would I deliberately crash into her? I have no reason!"

"She just couldn't afford to lose, deliberately slowing down to make me crash!"


"Blake darling, I'm so upset, my stomach hurts..."

The last complaint made me want to laugh, though the pain in my own stomach made that impossible. Here she was, pretending to have stomach pains,while I was fighting my cancer.

I pushed myself off the wall, forcing my legs to carry me back to my own room. A few minutes later, when I returned to my room on the second
floor, only Astrid remained.

"Felix had to leave - urgent family business," she said, crossing the room to grasp my hand. Her eyes searched my face. "Blake and that bitch,they didn't give you too much trouble, did they?"

I shook my head slightly. "Blake just wanted me to apologize to Laurel."

"Apologize?!" Astrid's eyes widened in disbelief. "When that woman deliberately tried to kill you? God, is Blake completely blind?" She gripped my hand tighter. "The nerve of him, demanding you apologize!"

I closed the door quietly, trading my hospital gown for the clothes Astrid had brought. A faint smile touched my lips. "Well, I've always been an easy target for him, haven't I?"

Three years of marriage had taught me well -always take responsibility,always apologize with a smile, always maintain the perfect image of a wealthy man's wife. No wonder Blake thought my apologies came cheap.I'd given them away so freely, hadn't I?

"Tell me you didn't actually apologize to her," Astrid said, watching me with concern.


"No." I smoothed down my fresh clothes, my voice steady. "I'm not that person anymore."


Astrid let out a breath I hadn't realized she was holding. "Good. That's more like it!"


Before she could say more, my phone rang - Dr. Evans.

My heart skipped. She usually only sent messages, knowing I wanted to keep my condition private. A call meant urgency.
I gestured to Astrid and stepped into the stairwell, my hand trembling slightly as I answered. "Dr. Evans? What's wrong?"

"Miss Sinclair." Her voice carried an unmnistakable strain. "The gentleman who wants to buy your medication just called. He needs the doses for his girlfriend immediately."

She paused briefly. "He's asking about the fifty million. And he wants to meet with you."

My fingers turned white around the phone. They had only made their offer through Dr. Evans this afternoon. Now, just hours later...

"There have been... complications," Dr. Evans continued carefully. "His girlfriend apparently suffered some severe emotional trauma..."

Her voice carried both apology and helplessness. "The pressure from the hospital board is immense. I can't hold them off any longer."

"I've been with your case from the start. If there was any other way..."

"I understand," I said softly. I knew she was just following orders from above.


"The hospital's handling of this has been completely inappropriate," she continued, guilt coloring her words. "For someone of his wealth, fifty million might be nothing, but for you..."

"Dr. Evans," I gently interrupted her, "this patient... how severe is her condition?"


The silence stretched on the other end. When she finally spoke, her voice was hoarse: "Why are you asking about that?"
I watched the darkening sky through the stairwell's dusty window. "We're both cancer patients. We should be helping each other."

"Though my condition is progressing faster and more severe..." I took a slow breath. "If her situation is truly critical, I'm willing to share one dose."

"This medication requires all five doses for a complete course," Dr. Evans reminded me, her voice gentle but ürgent. "Missing any would significantly reduce your chances of recovery."

My lips curved slightly. "The odds were never great to begin with."

"I won't go to the hospital or meet them," I said, my voice growing firmer.
"Tell them I'm still working on their fifty million. But if their situation is
truly desperate, they can have one dose."

"Just one condition," I added. "They need to donate one million to the International Cancer Research Foundation."

After a long silence, Dr. Evans sighed deeply. "Alright."

"Audrey... you're a remarkable woman."

"Thanks." I ended the call and turned back toward my room.
###Chapter 38: Does Laurel Have Some Terind Illness?

**Audrey's POV**

Inside, Astrid was leaning over the windowsill, gazing out.

I walked over to where Astrid stood and leaned against the window frame,following her gaze outside.

I raised an eyebrow. "What are you looking at?"

"God,you scared me!" Astrid jumped, spinning around to face me."Since when did you become so quiet?"

Outside, an ambulance was slowly pulling away from the hospital, its taillights gradually disappearing into the night. Something about that scene sent an inexplicable chill down my spine.

"That's Laurel and Blake in there," Astrid said, her voice tinged with sarcasm."The nurses said Laurel kept insisting she was traumatized,claiming everything hurts -her head, her heart, everything."

"And?"


"Blake immediately arranged for her transfer to Mayo Clinic." She pursed her lips. "They just left."

"You know what's funny?" Astrid couldn't help but add, shaking her head.
"Mayo Clinic is where they treat all the terminal cases and rare diseases."

"Taking his precious Hollywood princess there..." She gave a cold laugh.
Then, nudging my shoulder, she added, "Hey, does Laurel have some terminal illness?"
My heart skipped a beat. Mayo Clinic. Dr. Evans' phone call from this afternoon suddenly echoed in my mind - someone wanted to buy my experimental medication, claiming his girlfriend needed it immediately due to emotional trauma. The timing... could Blake be the buyer?

But I quickly dismissed the thought. Despite Laurel's constant display of fragility, her complexion was rosy, her voice strong and clear. I knew too well what late-stage gastric cancer looked like; that kind of suffering couldn't be easily faked.

"Audrey?"

I kept staring at the air, lost in thought, until Astrid waved her hand in front of me. "What are you thinking about?"

I snapped out of my daze and turned to give her a faint smile. "Nothing."

Crouching down to pick up my bag, I asked, "Have you counted how much I won for you at the track today?"

Her eyes instantly brightened. "Of course I did!"

"You made exactly three million, five hundred and forty-eight thousand!"She exclaimed, almost bouncing with excitement. "All these years, I've lost about one or two million to those trust fund kids. Finally made it back in one go!"

Wrapping an arm around my shoulders, she steered us toward the exit."And if Laurel hadn't pulled that dirty trick, we'd have more than fifty million now!"


I smiled but chose not to dwell on that thought. Instead, I glanced at her sideways. "So what's the plan? How are we celebrating this win?"
A mysterious smile played across her face. "Oh, we're going to... relax a bit!



Half an hour later, we stood outside a high-end spa in New York.Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, I could see the elegant décor and soft lighting inside.

"I thought when you said relax, we'd end up at The Underground again,"I looked at her, surprised.

"Can't always go clubbing," Astrid laughed,pushing me through the door."Besides, you've had a long day racing. I hate seeing you exhausted."

Since we didn't have appointments, we could only get two trainee therapists. The result was predictable - my body ended up covered in bruises and marks from their heavy-handed treatment. The manager apologized profusely, insisting on waiving our fee.

"Do these look like love bites to you?" I examined the marks on my neck and arms in the mirror.

Astrid leaned in for a closer look, her expression suddenly serious. "They kind of do. You'll need to cover these before mneeting Blake for the divorce tomorrow. That jerk might accuse you of having an affair!"

*I'm dying anyway, what affair?* The words almost slipped out, but I swallowed them back just in time.


It was late when we arrived at a Southern restaurant. Astrid ordered a table full of spicy dishes, the aroma of spicy shrimp and extra-hot wings filling the air.

"Eat up, Audrey," she enthusiastically served me. "Didn't you used to love spicy food? It's been a while, hasn't it?"
The array of spicy dishes in front of me made me hesitate.

My love for spicy food felt like a lifetime ago. Looking back, maybe that was one of the things that made my cancer spread so quickly.

Back then, spicy food was my escape. Every time Blake's indifference or his family's cruelty became too much, I'd find myself here with Astrid.They say spicy food triggers pain receptors - I guess that's why it worked so well at numbing everything else. A different kind of pain to drown out the emotional one.


But since the diagnosis, spicy food had become just another thing cancer had taken from me.


Astrid must have brought me here thinking I needed comfort after today's drama. The thought made something in my chest tighten. "Hey... thanks."

"For what?" She kept loading my plate with food. "Come on, dig in!" Then,noticing my hesitation, "You okay? You've barely touched anything."

Her concern made my throat tight. I forced down a few bites. "Just not that hungry."

After a few more mouthfuls, I pulled out my phone, pretending to check a message. "Sorry,need to take this," I said, already heading for the bathroom.


I barely made it to the stall before the pain hit. Even after getting rid of the spicy food, the burning in my stomach only intensified. I doubled over,one hand pressed against my chest, trying to breathe through thewaves of pain.


That's when voices drifted in from the sink area, "Seriously, Thalia, I thought Laurel was bringing Blake here tonight."
"God, I feel like such an idiot. I told everyone they'd be here. You should've seen the looks I got."

I pressed my lips together, recognizing Olivia's voice immediately.

"She's in the hospital." Thalia's voice carried that particular note of calculated concern that the Parker women had perfected.

"Hospital?" Olivia's surprise was genuine. "But I just saw her at...”

"All thanks to that *witch*." The venom in Thalia's voice made it clear exactly who she meant. "Blake took her to the track to unwind,and wouldn't you know who shows up?"

"No way..."

"Oh yes. And get this - she actually had the nerve to race against Laurel.Her! Can you imagine?" A dramatic pause. "Of course she ended up crashing right into her."

"That's horrible! Is she...”

"Just FaceTimed her actually." I could practically hear Thalia's dismissive wave. "Nothing seríous. Tiny scratch on her forehead." Then, her voice brightening with obvious pleasure, "Won't affect next week at all."

"Next week?"


"The engagement ceremony? God, Olivia, keep up! Blake's been planning it forever -booked the Four Seasons over a month ago. The cake alone is like,insane."


"Right! I completely forgot they were announcing it next week!" Olivia's excitement bubbled over. "I mean, everyone knows it's happening, but still..
"Well, if that *woman* had ruined it..."
###Chapter 39: His Heart Belonged to Someon Else Long Before

**Audrey's POV**

I crouched in the restaurant's bathroom stalI, listening as Thalia Parker and Olivia Cavendish's voices faded away. My stomach churned with a familiar pain. but this time, it wasn't just the illness - it was the bitter taste of betrayal.

Every time I'd brought up divorce recently, Blake had fought against it with such conviction that I'd almost believed he truly wanted to save our marriage.

But now I finally knew the truth: he'd reserved the venue and cake a month ago,planning his proposal to Laurel while pretending to fight for us.


*So it was all an act*, I thought, pressing my hand against my queasy stomach.*Every word, every gesture, every moment of apparent sincerity -just another performance in Blake Parker's grand production.*

The pain was getting worse. I fumbled through my purse with trembling fingers, found the small bottle of pills I'd been keeping close lately. I swallowed two tablets dry, waiting for the edge to dull before checking my reflection.A few deep breaths, a careful reapplication of lipstick, and the mask was back in place. Astrid wouldn't notice anything wrong.

When I finally returned to our table, Astrid was demolishing a bowl of spicy ramen, sweat beading on her forehead. Her eyes narrowed with concern as soon as she saw me.

"Hey, you were gone forever. Is your stomach giving you trouble again?"
She put down her chopsticks. "Maybe we should get you checked at Mayo Clinic? Or we could go somewhere else?"

I shook my head, managing a smile. "It's nothing. I'll just have something light later."

"Oh God, Audrey, I'm so sorry!" Astrid's eyes widened with sudden realization. "I completely forgot about your stomach condition..."

"Just eat," I cut her off. "Since when did you become such a drama queen?"

She rolled her eyes. "Oh, excuse me for giving a damn," She jutted out her lower lip before diving back into her ramen. "Fine, whatever. But we're hitting the pharmacy after this, no arguments!"

I wrapped my hands around a warm cup of tea, smiling as I watched her eat.


Looking at my friend's vibrant energy, the weight of my three-month prognosis felt heavier than ever. I wanted to tell her-God,how I wanted to share this burden. But seeing her there, so full of life, the words refused to leave my throat.

"Astrid." My voice came out raspier than intended.

She glanced up, noodles dangling from her chopsticks. "What's up?"

Looking at her flushed face and the sheer life radiating from her, I couldn't do it. Couldn't shatter this moment with my death sentence. Instead,I managed a weak smile and handed her a napkin. "You've got sauce all over your face."

"Who cares?" she declared, pushing the napkin aside. "Saving trees,one napkin at a time!"
I found myself laughing despite everything, but my amusement was cut short by an all-too-familiar saccharine voice:

"Miss Sinclair, Miss Wilson. what a pleasure to see you here."

I looked up at the sound of that voice.

Not far from our table stood Laurel, dressed in pristine white, her arm delicately wrapped around Blake's. Her lips curved in a gentle smile as she gazed at us, the picture of elegant poise.

I couldn't help but arch an eyebrow.

So Olivia couldn't stand being looked down upon - she must have called them here deliberately.


But...

Laurel stood there, looking absolutely radiant - a stark contrast to her supposedly injured state from the racetrack incident just hours ago.

The sight of them together made my stomach twist even more violently than before.


Blake's cold gaze fixed on my tea cup. "Spicy food with bleeding gums?Really?"

"We'll eat whatever we damn well please," Astrid snapped. "What's it to you?"


"Think your illness isn't serious enough?" His voice carried that familiar mix of disdain and something else -something I used to mistake for concern. "Eating this kind of food - do you even care about your health?"

"How touching, Mr. Parker," I said, unable to keep the sarcasm from my
voice. "Standing here with your new love while showing concern for your SOOH-tO-beex-wife -aren't you afraid Miss Rose will get jealous?"

"Audrey, I've told you, you're misunderstanding my relationship with Laurel! I just see her as my sister!" Blake's voice rose with frustration.

*Misunderstanding?* I wanted to laugh. *He reserved the proposal venue a month ago, and he has the audacity to stand here claiming there's nothing between them?*


"Birds of a feather really do flock together, Mr. Parker," I said with a cold smile. "I see you've picked up Laurel's acting skills."

I could see the flames in Blake's eyes, his anger evident.

Laurel gave a delicate painful expression. "Blake, don't be angry. Audrey's probably still upset about what happened at the racetrack this afternoon...Maybe my presence here is making her uncomfortable..."


"She nearly got you killed, and she's the one who's uncomfortable?" Blake held her,glaring at me.


Laurel dabbed at her eyes theatrically. "Audrey, I know you misunderstand me, hate me. I should go. Even though we're divorcing tomorrow, we shouldn't be like enemies after being married for so long."She turned, making a show of walking toward the stairs, though her steps were deliberately slow-she had no intention of actually leaving.

"Laurel, did the racetrack accident hurt your legs?" Astrid's voice was filled with mockery. "You seem to be having trouble walking."

I stood up, gathering my things. "Since Laurel can't leave, we will. I have nothing more to say to Mr. Parker anyway. Just remember to be at court on time tomorrow morning."
Astrid shot Blake one final glare. "Go comfort your precious Laurel. This isn't over!"

As we walked toward the exit, I heard Laurel's trembling voice: "Blake...Audrey still seems to misunderstand us... Maybe you should go after her and explain? I don't want people thinking your divorce is... because of me."

"There's nothing to explain," Blake's voice carried across the restaurant."Actions speak louder than words."

The parking garage was eerily quiet, our footsteps echoing off the concrete walls. Astrid was still fuming as she slid into the driver's seat of her car.

"Why do we have to run into them everywhere? It's infuriating!"

I leaned back in the passenger seat, staring out atthe darkness outside. "It s a popular restaurant. It's not surprising they'd be here for dinner."

"Even if they're here for dinner, do they have to be literally joined at the hip? Her hanging on his arm like that?" Astrid's knuckles whitened on the steering wheel. "It's disgusting. Makes me sick!"

I looked out the window, watching couples walking arm in arm along the illuminated streets. The city was coming alive with its usual evening energy, but I wasn't in the mood to admire it.


"They're in their honeymoon phase," I said calmly, "It's natural they want to be close."


Astrid shot me a surprised look. "Audrey,how can you be so calm about this?"


I kept my tone steady, as if discussing strangers rather than my husband and his mistress. "They'll be having their engagement party in about a
week. Blake has prepared everything a month ago."

"What the hell?" Astrid's voice rose sharply. "So before Laurel even came back from Europe, that bastard had already planned to propose to her? He's been wanting this divorce all along, hasn't he?"

My lips curved into a bitter smile as I watched the city lights blur together.

"Yes. His heart belonged to someone else long before any of this began..."
###Chapter 40: I Am on My Way!

**Audrey's POV**

One month ago. That was when Blake had started planning his engagement ceremony wth Laurel Rose. One month.

What had I been doing back then? *Our baby.* I remembered the desperate hope as I consulted doctor after doctor, trying to find a way to protect our child despite my failing body. Now the memory just felt like a cruel joke. While I had been fighting to save the last piece of our relationship growing inside me, he had been preparing a grand proposal to another woman.


"God, Audrey, I'm just glad you're done with all that mess," Astrid's voice cut through my dark thoughts. Her hand found mine, squeezing tight."Can you imagine how much worse this would hurt if you weren't?"

I turned to her with a practiced smile. "Right."

*Done with all that mess.* The words tasted bitter in my mouth. After being hurt so many times, afterhaving my hopes shattered again and again, perhaps I had finally grown numb. Was that the same as being done?


"Can we head back?" I said softly, staring out at the darkness beyond the car window.

Astrid nodded quickly, starting the engine. "Right, let's not waste another second talking about those two jerks." She forced some cheer into her voice.
"Besides,bet Snow's going crazy waiting for you!"

The apartment felt colder than usual as Astrid walked me to the door.She
lingered,pretending to play with Snow while secretly watching me from the corner of her eye.

"Look who's getting chunky," she cooed, dangling a toy just out of Snow's reach. Her eyes kept darting to my face, checking my expression.

I maintained my composure, moving around the living room with deliberate normalcy. Only when I heard the door click shut behind her did I let the mask slip.


The pain hit immediately, doubling me over. I collapsed onto the sofa;clutching my stomach as waves of agony ripped through me. The spicy food I'd forced down at the restaurant to maintain my façade was taking its revenge.


Snow sensed my distress, pressing her warm body against mine. Her soft fur tickled my face as she tried to burrow closer, offering what comfort she could.


With trembling fingers, I found my phone. Muscle memory took over as I hit the emergency contact - a number I'd called so many times over the past three years.

"Yeah?"


The familiar edge in Blake's tone made my chest tighten. "Audrey." A beat."What is it?"


I tried to speak, but the pain stole my voice. The background noise from his end filled the silence - laughter, music, glasses clinking from the restaurant we'd left'earlier.

"Seriously?" His impatience crackled through the line. "You couldn't say whatever this is to my face earlier, but now you're calling?"
As I could gather my strength to respond, "Blake, I..."

Thalia's voice cut through: "Hey, whose turn? Oh my god, Laurel's up next!



"Please..." Laurel's voice sounded. "Can I skip this? I don't want to kiss in public..."


I heard movement, then the background noise faded. Blake had stepped away from the party, his voice dropping lower with concern he couldn't quite hide: "Audrey! Just... say something, will you?"

The use of my first name, the worry in his tone - once,those would have meant everything to me. Now they just made the pain worse. I ended the call,letting the phone slip from my fingers.

The phone started ringing again, the ringtone filling the silence of my apartment. I knew it was Blake, but I just lay there on the cod floor,Snow's warmth pressed against me, letting each ring fade into the next. The world was starting to blur around the edges, darkness creeping in from the corners of my vision. Still, I didn't answer.


I don't know how long I stayed there, drifting in and out of consciousness as his calls went unanswered. Finally, the ringing stopped.


Snow suddenly wriggled free from my arms, jumping onto the coffee table.Her movement knocked over a forgotten cup of tea, sending the cold liquid splashing across my arm. The sudden shock of it pulled me back from the edge of darkness.


"Thank you, Snow," I whispered, finding the strength to push myself up.My hands were shaking as I reached for my phone, scrolling through my contacts until I found James Collins' name. I hesitated for a long moment,
then pressed the call.

It was answered quickly. "Audrey? What's up?"

The noisy background sound indicated that he was at some kind of party.However, at this moment, the pain in my stomach made it impossible for me to think much.

"James..." My voice came out hoarse and weak.


His tone changed instantly. "Hey, what's wrong? Talk to me - where are you?"

"My... apartment."

"Don't move an inch. I'm on my way!"

**Blake's POV**

I stared at my dark phone screen, jaw clenched as I tried to make sense of what had just happened. Lost in thought, I nearly collided with someone rushing down the restaurant stairs. Looking up, I found myself face to face with James Collins.


Watching him try to rush past. I immediately stopped him. "Where's the fire? Mr. Collins?"


He froze, recognition dawning. "Blake Parker?"

"Seriously? Is this your attitude?" I let my voice drop to a dangerous purr."Talking to the head of your partner company like this?"

He swallowed hard and shifted his stance. "Mr. Parker. My apologies for the informality. But I've got an urgent situation that needs handling."
He tried to step around me, but I deliberately shifted into his path."Urgent situation, huh? Wouldn't happen to involve Audrey Sinclair, would it?"

The moment James heard Audrey's name, I could see his eyes widen slightly.

After a moment, he curved his lips into a smile and said, "Mr. Parker,you must be joking. Audrey and I aren't that close. It's so late. Why on earth would she look for me?"


Hearing James say this, my frown eased a little. "Ture. She only has eyes for me."

Watching his face turned deathly pale, I felt an indescribable sense of triumph inside.

He forced an awkward smile, "Was there anything else, Mr. Parker?"

"No." I finally stepped aside. "But if you do happen to hear from Audrey,tell her to stop playing these games. Calling and not speaking - it's childish."


With that, I strode up the stairs.

Back in the private room, the party was in full swing. My sister and her friends continued teasing Laurel, who played her part perfectly.

"Guys, stop!" she giggled, pressing closer to me. "You're making me blush..."


I sat rigidly in my chair, half-listening to the congratulations innuendos while staring at my phone. Our chat history showed nothing new since the morning she lost our child. The woman who used to send
dozens of messages daily hadn't contacted me in over two weeks.

After long consideration, I typed two words: "Real mature."

Once, any message from me would have earned an immediate, enthusiastic response. Tonight, there was only silence.

On the car. Laurel's voice carried that practiced note of concern. "
Everything okay, Blake? You've been glued to youar phone all night.
Trouble at the office?"

I caught her trying to sneak a peek at my screen and quickly locked it."Just Michael.Work stuff."


She did that little poutthing she'd perfected. "Always working..."

After dropping Laurel at the Rose mansion, My driver cleared his throat:"Where to, Mr. Parker? The office or the family estate?"

"Home." The word slipped out before I could catch it.

"Sir...which one?"

I shot him a cold look. "WVhat do you think?"

"Got it... sir." He nodded slightly, heading towards the Lunar mansion.
###Chapter 41: Let Her Come Out and Face Me

**Laurel's POV**

Through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the Rose mansion, I tracked Blake's car as it disappeared into the night. *Wrong direction, darling.* My nails dug into my palms.

The delicate clink of china against china announced my mother's presence before her reflection appeared in the window beside mine. "Tea, dear?" My mother,Scarlett Rose's voice carried concern. "Blake's heading home rather late. The Parker mansion isn't in that direction,is it?"


I accepted the cup. "No. He's heading to the Lunar Mansion." The words tasted bitter on my tongue. "Where he lived with Audrey."

Scarlett's carefully manicured brows drew together. "You said she'd moved out?"


"Oh, she has." My lips curved into a cold smile as I watched the last trace of his taillights disappear. "But clearly, I underestimated her... lingering influence."


What was it about that woman?


"Sweetheart." Scarlett's hand found my shoulder, her touch gentle. "They've been married for three years after all. These things take time tofade."

I didn't bother responding. My mind was already several steps ahead,calculating adjustments to my carefully laid plans. If Blake was still drawn to their old home,perhaps...

"By the way," Scarlett's voice interrupted my thoughts, her tone suddenly hesitant. "Martha and I are visiting Rachel tomorrow. It's been three years,
Laurel. Maybe you'd like to..."

The teacup shattered against the floor before I'd even registered throwing it. "So that's why you waited up. I told you don't mention her in front of me."

"Laurel!" Scarlett flinched at my tone. "Rachel Hayes is your sister..."


"Half-sister," I corrected coldly. "Your daughter with that man is nothing to me. Don't ever mention that vegetable to me again"


With that, I turned away. "It's better for everyone if we just... forget she exists."


"Laurel..." Scarlett's voice cracked. "You and Rachel were so close once.What happened to you?"


I paused at the doorway but didn't turn back. "Your little girl is in a hospital bed, Mother. And I? I'm going to be Mrs. Blake Parker. That's all that matters now."


**Blake's POV**


I shrugged off my coat at the Lunar Mansion's entrance, hanging it like usual before striding into the living room. The space felt wrong. Empty.


Audrey used to fill every corner with plants and flowers, transforming the formal space into something alive, Each evening, she'd wait here with dinner ready and that oversized cat of hers, both of them watching the door for my return.

The expensive vases still lined the shelves, but their contents had withered to brittle stems and dried petals. Like everything else in this house, they were just hollow reminders of what was missing.
Out of nowhere, her phone call from earlier nagged at me. That silence before she hung up...

I pulled out my phone, checking our message thread. My last text-"real mature"- sat there unanswered, almost accusatory in its solitude. After a moment's hesitation, I typed: "About that call earlier. Something wrong?"

Five minutes passed without response. Each second of silence amplified the emptiness of the house around me.

I couldn't wait any longer, dialing a number. "Michael. Send me Audrey's current address."


Thirty minutes later, I found myself staring at a rundown apartment complex that had no business housing my wife. Half the street lights were broken,casting shadows across cracked concrete. The security guard -who had to be pushing seventy - barely looked up from his newspaper as I passed.


This was where Audrey had chosen to live? After three years in the Parker family,she'd settled for... this?


*You're doing fine without me*, she'd said. The memory of her words twisted something in my chest as I took in the building's facade. This wasn't "fine." This wasn't even close to acceptable.


The elevator's grimy buttons made my jaw clench. Third floor. The hallway stretched before me, fluorescent lights flickering against peeling wallpaper.

"Audrey," I knocked on her door, trying to keep the edge from my voice.

Silence.
Something cold settled in my stomach. I knocked harder. "Audrey?"

Just when I was about to call Michael for a key, the door opened. My relief lasted exactly one second - until I registered who stood in the doorway.

"Mr. Parker." James Collins leaned against the frame, a black bag dangling from one hand. "Glad to see you again."


My eyes narrowed. "James? What on earth are you doing here? Where is Audrey. Let her come out and face me."


"She doesn't want to see you." James shifted his stance, deliberately blocking any view into the apartment. "Mr. Parker, it's late. Audrey's resting. Whatever it is can wait until tomorrow."


Before I could respond, a familiar "meow" cut through the tension. Snow darted between James's legs, making a beeline for me. The cat wound around my ankles, rubbing its head against my pants leg with obvious affection.


Strange. I'd never particularly liked this cat before-it shed everywhere and was as clingy as its owner. But now, watching Snow choose me over James, I felt an unexpected surge of satisfaction.


I crouched down, scooping the cat into my arms. "This is our cat," I said,meeting James's eyes with deliberate emphasis on 'our.' "Mine and Audrey's."


He gave a cold laugh. "Cats can't tell right from wrong. If Snow knew how you've treated Audrey, she wouldn't be so friendly."

"Mind your own business," I straighténed, trying to see past him into the apartment. "Audrey! Come out."
we weren enough, but having men over?

James tensed visibly. "I told you, she's resting!" Before I could push past him,he slammed the door behind him. "Mr. Parker, she's not your wife anymore. Stop harassing her."

"Her cat is still in my arms. She told me she wanted..."

"She doesn't want it anymore!" James's voice cut off me. "She said she's cutting ties with the past - that includes the cat you raised together. Keep it if you want!"


With that, he headed for the elevator. "Mr. Parker, I'm leaving now.I think you better not to stay here."

I frowned,knocking one more time. Only silence answered.

"She's weak," James said, his voice softening slightly. "She hasn't been sleeping well. If you really need something, come back tomorrow."

I rarely let anyone speak to me this way, especially someone of James's status. Usually, such insolence would have consequences.But all I could focus on was what he'd said about Audrey being weak, not sleeping.

Finally, I lowered my hand. Turning toward the elevator with Snow in my arms, I looked at him. "I'll leave her alone. You should do the same."

James's laugh held no humor. "You think I'm anything like you?"

We rode down in tense silence. Outside, we headed for our respective cars.

Watching his taillights disappear, I gently scratched behind Snow's ears."Let's go home,little one."
The cat snuggled deeper into my arms with a soft meow. The gesture reminded me painfully of how Audrey used to curl into me,seeking warmth in exactly the same way.

I looked up at her darkened window. Just hours ago,she'd insisted on taking Snow in the divorce papers. Now she was giving up the cat entirely?

*What's really going on with you, Audrey?*
###Chapter 42:I WVant to Be with You

**Audrey's POV**

The first thing I noticed was the steady beeping of hospital monitors,followed by the antiseptic smell that seemed embedded in Mayo Clinic's walls. My eyes felt heavy as I tried to open them, and that's when I became aware of the warmth around my hand.

James Collins sat beside my bed, his usually impeccable appearance showing clear signs of having spent the night in that uncomfortable hospital chair. His suit jacket was draped over the back, his sleeves rolled up. and his tie loosened - a rare sight for someone who maintained such careful composure.

"Audrey, for god's sake, you're finally awake." Relief flooded his voice."How are you feeling?"

I tried to shift position, but even that small movement sent a dull ache through my body. James's grip on my hand tightened slightly.


"Is your stomach still hurting? Any other discomfort?" His brown eyes were intense with concern. "Do you have any idea how worried I was last night? The doctor said if I hadn't gotten you here when I did..."


"Then I'm glad you came in time," I managed softly, attempting to withdraw my hand from his grip. But my body felt too weak to manage even that simple movement. "I'm much better now."

Maybe sensing my movement, James tightened his hold on my hand even more and moved closer to me. The moment I saw this, I subconsciously frowned.
"Audrey." His voice took on a serious tone I rarely heard from him. "You know, while waiting during your emergency treament last night, I made a decision."

"James, please..," I could see where this was going, and a different kind of pain bloomed in my chest.

"Let me finish." He took a deep breath. "I want to be more than just friends. Audrey. I want to be with you."

My body tensed involuntarily at his words, sending fresh waves of discomfort through my stomach. But the physical pain was nothing compared to the ache of having to hurt someone I cared about.

"James, don't joke about this." I forced the words out, trying to keep my voice steady. "I've told you I'm not looking for a relationship."

"Plus, you know about my condition, I just have..."

"I know!" His voice cracked slightly. "I don't care how much time you have left. I want to be there for you!"

Using what little strength I had, I finally managed to pull my hand free from his grip. The effort left me breathless, and I had to lean back against the pillows,fighting a wave of dizziness.


James still wanted to reach out and grab my hand,but when he saw the red marks on my hand caused by his tight grip just now, he withdrew his outstretched hand awkwardly.

"I'm sorry," He ran,a hand through his disheveled hair. "I shouldn't have...



"It's fine," I cut him off, my voice soft but firm. "Let's pretend this never
happened."

The silence that followed was heavy with unspoken words. The steady beeping of the heart monitor seemed unnaturally loud in the quiet room.

He clenched his fists, staring at me. "But Audrey.I..."

"James," I immediately cut him off, choosing my words carefully."Among my friends, you're the only one who knows about my condition. That's why I called you last night."


I met his gaze directly. "Please don't make me regret that trust. Don't make me lose the one person I can turn to in emergencies."

I guessed that he had grasped the underlying meaning in my words-if he persisted in wanting to be with me, there was a high chance that we couldn't even stay friends. That was why he fell silent and gradually lowered his head.


Moments later, he raised his head, understanding dawned in his eyes,followed by resignation. "Alright," he said. "But next time something happens, call me directly. Don't try Blake first."

"It was just... force of habit." The admission tasted bitter on my tongue.

James shifted in his chair, his expression growing careful. "I ran into Blake at the restaurant last night," he said slowly. "He said... he said to tell you to stop calling him without speaking. He said it was childish."

The words hit like a physical blow. My heart contracted painfully, and for a moment, I couldn't tell which hurt more - the cancer eating away at my body or the casual cruelty of Blake's dismissal. Of course he would see my desperate call for help as mere attention-seeking. His returned call probably wasn't even concern - he'd likely just wanted to berate me for
bothering him.

A knock at the door interrupted my spiraling thoughts. Dr. Evans entered,her presence bringing a welcome distraction from the emotional tension in the room.


"Miss Sinclair, how are you feeling nowv?" she asked, checking my vitals with professional efficiency.


"Can she eat something?" James straightened in his chair. "I could get breakfast."


"Not yet." Dr. Evans cautioned, making notes on my chart.Her eyes flickered between James and me, a small smile playing at her lips. "You've found yourself a good one here."

"You have no idea how worried he was about you last night! When I asked him to go back and get the log of your medication intake, he did it right away. And he stayed outside the emergency room the whole time,not sleeping a wink all night!"


"He's a friend from college, nothing more," I corrected firmly,perhaps more sharply than necessary. From the corner of my eye, I saw James's shoulders tense slíghtly.

"Well, okay then. My bad,"

Watching her check my vitals, Iasked the question that had been nagging at me. "How serious was last night?"

Dr. Evans's expression hardened. "You lost consciousness from the pain,and you're asking how serious it was?" She fixed me with a pointed look."With your condition, spicy food is practically suicidal. Don't try them,or you won't even make it three months."
She paused, checking my charts. "We were fortunate, actuaally. The dose you agreed to share yesterday- the patient ended up declining it at the last minute."

Her words made me frown. "The one who asked for fifty million?"


Dr. Evans sighed, setting down her pen. "Yes. Everything was prepared,but when she arrived at the hospital, she suddenly declined the treatment.So.you're quite lucky."


She rubbed her temples, looking troubled. "One more thing, her lawyers want to meet with you this week to discuss a collaboration."


"Collaboration? Seriously?" I just found this concept absurd. Both of us were cancer patients. What kind of collaboration could we need?

"I don't know all the details," Dr. Evans admitted, running a hand through her hair in frustration. "You'll understand everything when you meet with her legal representative. What I do know is that this could be good for you. Her boyfriend has considerable resources - he might be able to find even more effective treatments."


As she turned back to making notes in my chart, I reached for my phone on the bedside table. The moment I turned on my phone, multiple messages from Astrid lit up the screen:

*Girl, I'm at your place - are you at the courthouse already?*

*It's D-Day with Blake! Make sure you look amazing - make that jerk regret everything!*

*Why aren't you picking up? What's happening at the court?*

*Did that jerk cause any troubles? And is that bitch there with him?*
Seeing these messages. I widened my eyes. The divors paeeedings fn all the chass of last night. I'd complerely forgoren.Checking dhe time-9 AM -sent a tah of pank through me

"Can I. te discharged now?" I asked atready rying ts posh myself up.
###Chapter 43: I'll Take You There Now!
Audrey's POV
Dr. Evans stared at me in stunned silence, her expression a mix of disbelief and professional concern. To her, I was a medical anomaly; to myself, I was simply a woman running out of time.
"Miss Sinclair," she began, her voice dropping to a serious tone. "Patients with your diagnosis require constant, expert monitoring. Your body has barely stabilized after last night’s crisis."
I gripped the edge of the hospital sheets, my voice trembling but determined. "I understand the risks, Dr. Evans, but I cannot stay here today. It's... it's a matter of my future."
"Your future depends on your survival!" She set her clipboard down with a sharp thud. "Whatever you have planned can wait. You are staying here for a full day of observation. No exceptions."
To ensure I didn't try to leave, she assigned a resident, Dr. Alexander Blackwood, to stay near my room. He positioned himself by the door, a silent guardian of my recovery, effectively ending any hope of an early discharge.
I sighed, reaching for my phone with a heavy heart. I needed to tell Blake I couldn't make it to the court. That’s when I saw his messages:
Real mature, Audrey.
And then, half an hour later:
About that call earlier. Was there actually an emergency?
A bitter smile touched my lips. It had taken him hours to even consider that my midnight call might have been a genuine plea for help. If it had been Laurel, he would have broken down the hospital doors, wouldn't he?
The phone vibrated in my hand—Blake was calling. I took a steadying breath and answered.
"Audrey, where are you?" His voice was tight with suppressed irritation. "The clerk is waiting. I’m at the courthouse."
"Blake, I'm... I'm not well. I’m at the clinic."
"Not well?" He let out a cold, skeptical breath. "Is this another—"
Before I could finish my explanation, the door to my room swung open. James walked in, carrying a cup of coffee that filled the air with a rich aroma. "Audrey, I found a place downstairs. I thought you might need the caffeine, though the doctors might complain..."
James stopped mid-sentence as he realized I was on the phone. But the silence on the other end of the line had already turned arctic.
"I see," Blake’s voice was now a lethal, frozen whisper. "So James Collins is the reason you’re too 'unwell' to show up for our legal proceedings?"
"No, Blake, that’s not it—"
"I cleared my entire morning to settle this," Blake cut me off, the dangerous edge in his voice vibrating through the speaker. "And you used that time to host guests. Consider any further discussion of our separation off the table. I'm done playing your games."
Blake's POV
I ended the call before she could offer another excuse. The interior of the car felt suffocating. "Back to the office," I told the driver.
Michael, my assistant, caught my eye in the rearview mirror. "Sir... are we leaving? Should we wait for Mrs. Parker?"
I shot him a glance that made his shoulders tense. "She’s occupied," I snapped.
I leaned back against the leather seat, closing my eyes. But all I could see was the image of James Collins comfortably at her bedside in the early morning hours. He had been at her apartment last night, and now he was at the hospital. The thought sparked a cold, sharp fury I refused to name.
"Change of plans," I said, my voice carrying a weight that brooked no questions. "Take me to Audrey’s apartment first. I need to see exactly what she’s been hiding."
Audrey's POV
"Audrey, I’m so sorry," James said, running a hand through his hair, his face filled with guilt. "Did I just make things worse?"
"It's not your fault, James," I said, leaning back into the pillows, suddenly drained of all energy.
Alexander, the resident watching the door, couldn't help but chime in. "Tough break. It sounded like you were trying to explain a genuine medical emergency, and he heard a rival's voice instead. Talk about a worst-case scenario."
James stepped forward, looking determined. "I’ll go to the Parker Group. I’ll explain everything to Blake—that you were unconscious, that I’m just helping as a friend."
"Don't bother, James." I closed my eyes, a dull throb beginning in my temples. "Blake’s ego is bruised because I didn't appear when summoned. That’s the only truth he sees right now."
I forced a faint smile to reassure him. "The divorce will happen eventually. He and Laurel have an engagement gala next week. He won't want to be legally tied to me when that happens."
"James," I added, seeing his hesitation. "You haven't slept. Go home. Dr. Blackwood will look after me."
"Call me if anything changes," James said, lingering in the doorway before finally disappearing down the hall.
Once he was gone, Alexander shifted in his chair, his curiosity finally getting the better of him. "So... is he the reason you're leaving your husband, or is your husband the reason you're with him?"
I looked toward the window, the NYC skyline blurred by the morning haze. "It’s much simpler than that, Alexander. I’m just choosing to spend my last days without the weight of a ghost."

###Chapter 44: What A Coincidence, Miss Sndar
Audrey's POV
I hesitated at Alexander’s question, then shook my head slowly. "Of course not. It’s not about abuse or anything so dramatic."
He leaned forward, his curiosity undeterred. "Then is it because you don't want to be a burden? Many patients with chronic conditions feel that way when their relationships are... complicated."
My breath caught, but I kept my expression neutral. "It’s simpler and yet more complex than that, Alexander. It’s just time for a change."
"Well," Alexander sighed, leaning back and watching the sunlight play across the sterile floor. "It’s hard to reconcile. You’re brilliant and composed. It makes me wonder what your husband is thinking. People in the hospital have been talking about that actress who came in yesterday—Laurel Rose."
I felt a slight chill at the mention of her name. "Is she... recovering?"
"The word in the corridors is that it’s mostly for show," he said, lowering his voice. "She looks perfectly healthy, yet she’s got a dedicated team acting like it’s a national emergency. And her partner... Blake Parker, right? He’s been practically haunting the VIP wing, ensuring she has the best of everything."
"I see," I murmured, staring at my pale hands. "He was always very protective of what he valued."
In Blake’s eyes, a minor scratch on Laurel was a catastrophe that required the world to stop. Meanwhile, my silence and my struggles were just part of the background noise of his life.
The sudden chime of Alexander’s phone broke the quiet. He frowned at the message, his shoulders tensing with professional urgency.
"Go ahead," I urged, managing a wan smile. "It looks important."
"I shouldn't leave you alone. Dr. Evans was very specific about your monitoring."
"I’m not going anywhere, Dr. Blackwood. My husband made it clear he won't let the divorce proceed today anyway. I’m quite literally trapped."
He frowned, then his face brightened as he scrolled through his contacts. "Actually, I have a friend who’s between classes. He’s reliable and could keep you company so you aren't staring at these four walls alone. Ethan?" he said into the phone as the call connected. "I need a huge favor. I’ve got a patient who needs a friendly face for an hour."
"I'm on my way," a voice replied.
Something about the name "Ethan" sparked a distant memory, but it remained out of reach. Half an hour later, when a young man in a blue tracksuit appeared in the doorway, the pieces clicked into place. He was the student I’d met at a social event with Astrid—the one who had helped us navigate a crowded night when I was trying to forget my crumbling marriage.
Ethan lingered in the doorway as Alexander made his exit. A hint of a warm, genuine smile played on his lips as he recognized me.
"Well," he said, stepping inside with an easy grace. "What a coincidence, Miss Sinclair."
His presence brought a sudden, much-needed warmth to the room. He sat in the chair Alexander had vacated, glancing at the fruit basket on my bedside table.
"So," he said, casually opting for an apple. "What brings someone like you to a place like this? You look like you’ve been through a storm."
"Just some persistent health issues," I said, leaning back against the pillows.
"At Mayo Clinic? That’s like calling in a tactical team to fix a leaky faucet," he joked, his youthful energy infectious. "Can you even eat any of this?"
I shook my head, a genuine smile finally reaching my eyes.
"More for me, then." He took a bite, sprawling comfortably in the chair. "I’m six months away from finishing my degree. You should come to my graduation party. I’ll make sure you get the best seat."
Six months. The number echoed in my head, tasting like ash. I would be lucky to see the next ninety days. "That sounds lovely," I whispered, turning my head away before he could see the shadow in my eyes.
Before the conversation could go further, my phone buzzed. It was Astrid.
"Audrey, where are you?" her voice came through, high-pitched with anxiety. "I went to the courthouse and they said you never showed. Then I went to your apartment... and guess who I found there?"
I tensed, my heart starting to race. "Who?"
"Blake Parker. And he looks like he’s ready to tear the building down."

###Chapter 45: You're Sick and You Didn't Tel Me?

**Audrey's POV**

My heart skipped a beat. "Blake?"

"Yeah. I thought I'd found you a place secluded enough, but he still managed to track you down!"

I sat up straighter, gripping the phone tighter. "What's he doing at my place?"

"Says you stood him up, came to 'settle scores'- he's completely lostit!"Astrid's voice still carried her heavy anger. "He somehow convinced himself you were home, and when he didn't have a key, he just kicked your door in!"

"When I got there, he was standing in your apartment with his precious Laurel Rose. That scene is just too disgusting so I kicked them both out!"

She continued, apparently trying to tidy up my apartment. "They've turned your whole place upside down. Were they looking for something specific or just being destructive?"

As Astrid's words sank in, my mind went blank for a moment.

*Snow!*

The name burst into my mind with such force I nearly dropped the phone.
"Astrid," I cut through her tirade, panicclawing up my throat. "The cat-check for Snow! I'm not home when this happened - she must be terrified!"

"Oh god," I could hear her moving, voice shifting as she searched. "That's
what felt off! Under the couch? The bed?"

"Anywhere!" The word came out sharp enough to make Ethan jump. "She hides when she's scared, and with strangers breaking in-"

"Who's Snow by the way?" Ethan's question floated past me, barely registering.

My chest felt too tight. "My cat," I managed, though the words felt inadequate. How could I explain that Snow was the only pure thing to come out of my marriage? The only warmth in those endless nights when Blake's side of the bed stayed cold and empty? That in a life where I'd learned to expect nothing, she'd been my one constant?

I could walk away from the Parker fortune. The mansions. The cars. All of it. But Snow...


"Audrey, I can't find her. " Astrid's voice had gone soft in a way that made my blood run cold. "I've looked everywhere - under the sofa, under the bed, in all the closets..." She paused. "Usually when I visit, she comes running as soon as I call. Today, nothing."

The possibility that Snow might have escaped when Blake kicked in the door sent waves of nausea through me that had nothing to do with my illness. She was an indoor cat, completely unprepared for the streets of New York. The thought of her lost and frightened made my chest constrict painfully.

"I need to come there," I said, already trying to push myself up from the hospital bed. "Ethan, help me up..."

He frowned, moving closer to my bed. His concern was too obvious.′′Ayou sure? You look really pale..."
The line went quiet for a moment, then Astrid's sharp intake of breath cut through the silence. "What's going on? Audrey? Where are you - in a hospital?"

I bit my lip, still struggling to push myself up despite the way the room tilted around me.

Seeing my determination. Ethan gently took the phone from my trembling hands. "Hey Astrid, this is Ethan - we met at The Underground,remember?"

"Of course I remember you, but what are you doing with..." Her voice trailed off, confusion evident.

"Listen," Ethan took a deep breath, keeping his voice steady."Audrey had a medical emergency last night. She's stable now, but stilI under observation. The doctors won't let her leave yet."

"I'm here looking after her. She's in no condition to be discharged, let alone searching for Snow, but she's insisting on getting up..."

"Wait,what?" Astrid's voice rose sharply. "Audrey, you're sick and you didn't tell me?!"


"Now I get why you míssed the divorce proceedings - you're stuck in observation! Does Blake know about this?"

I shot Ethan an accusing look as I reclaimed my phone. "I told him I wasn't feeling well. He didn't believe me."

"Of course he didn't!" Astrid's voice rose, showing her evident anger. "That bastard!"


"Astrid, please." I cut her off, pressing my fingers to my throbbing temple.
"I don't care about him right now. I just need to know where Snow is..."

"They probably let her out on purpose,knowing how much you care about her!" Astrid's voice was filled with anger. "Audrey, you focus on getting better. I'll put up missing cat posters and get everyone I know looking for her."

I pressed my lips together, fighting back tears. "Okay. Thanks, Astrid."

The line fell quiet after we ended the call. Ethan shifted in his chair,staring at me with a concerned expression.

"The timeline might work< in our favor," he said, his voice carrying that gentle optimism I'd come to associate with him. "If Snow went missing this morning, she likely hasn't ventured far. Most cats stay within familiar territory."

His words sparked a memory that made my heart skip. "Last night..." The realization hit me with sudden clarity. "I saw her last night, right before..."

*If she hadn't knocked over that tea...* The thought remained unfinished,but its weight pressed against my chest. That small accident might have saved my life.


The memory of James going to my apartment last night flashed through my mind. Hastily, I grabbed my phone and dialed James. "James." I struggled to keep my voice steady when he answered. "Last night, when everything happened... did you see my cat? A large white Ragdoll?"

The pause that followed stretched so long I wondered if the connection had failed. When he finally spoke, his voice carried an unusual roughness."No."


He added, almost too quickly, "What's wrong?"
I felt something inside me deflate. "Snow's missing. She's always been shy around strangers... if you didn't see her, she must have been hiding somewhere."

My voice sounded distant to my own ears as I added, "I'Il keep looking."

"Of course." There was something odd in the way he softened his tone."Call if you need anything."

I managed a quiet "thanks" before ending the call. The phone felt unusually heavy in my hand as I set it down, closing my eyes against the sudden burn of tears.

Everything I cherished was gone. First the cancer forced me to give up Blake - five years of love reduced to medical necessities and divorce papers.Now it seemed determined to take away my last source of comfort. Was it too much to ask for a few final months with my beloved cat?

Ethan's voice cut through my spiral of despair, warm and reassuring. "Let s not assume the worst. Snow knows your scent, knows her home.She's probably just found a quiet spot to wait for you."

"You mentioned she's shy, easily startled?" His gentle reminder of Snow's personality traits felt like a lifeline. "She'll come out when she feels safe."

Something in his words ignited a spark of determination. My eyes snapped open as I pushed myself upright. "Dr. Evans - I need to talk to her about discharge."


"Already ahead of you." A small smile played at the corners of his mouth as he held up his phone, displaying a series of text messages. "Alex checked with her. You're cleared to leave."

"Let me handle the paperwork while you get changed. Then we can search
the neighborhood together. Deal?"

The lump in my throat made it difficult to speak, so I just nodded,hoping he could read the gratitude in my eyes.

"Back in a few minutes!" Hlis voice carried a note of encouragement as he headed for the door.
###Chapter 46: Why Do You Care So Much About That Cat?

**Audrey's POV**

The simple act of changing clothes felt like an ordeal, each movement sending waves of discomfort through my body. I'd managed to slip off the hospital gown, replacing it with the comfortable clothes James had brought,but even that small effort left me breathless. As I was pulling the hoodie over my head, the door suddenly opened.

"Audrey, it's all done. Dr. Evans said that..." Ethan's voice trailed off abruptly. Through the fabric of the half-pulled hoodie, I heard his sharp intake of breath, followed by complete silence.

Finally freeing my head from the garment, I found him standing frozen in the doorway, his face flushed a deep crimson. He immediately averted his gaze, the phone in his hands suddenly becoming the most fascinating object in the room.

I couldn't help but smile at his reaction. For someone who worked at a nightclub, he could be surprisingly proper. "Sorry about that," I said softly,quickly adjusting the hoodie. The reflection on the window made me acutely aware of how the once well-fitted fabric now hung loose around my frame. Three years of maintaining the perfect figure as Mrs. Parker,and illness had accomplished what no diet ever could.

Ethan cleared his throat, still studying the phone with intense focus. "Dr.Evans said that if handwritten logs are difficult to maintain, you can keep them on your phone," he managed, his voice slightly strained. "Just... don't let what happened last night repeat itself. Having to send someone back for the logs when you were already in critical condition..."
My hands stilled on the zipper. "The medication logs., someone had to go back for them?"

"Yeah," He straightened slightly, watching my reaction."Dr. Evans mentioned your friend James seemed lost in your apartment. Took him ages to find them. Almost delayed the emergency treatment."

A chill that had nothing to do with the hospital's air conditioning ran down my spine. Why hadn't James mentioned this second visit to my apartment? The unease that had been building since our earlier conversation about Snow crystallized into something sharper.

I reached out for my phone, dialing James again.

"James," I called out, my voice was cold. "You went to my apartment twice last night, didn't you?"

The pause before his answer was barely noticeable. "Yes, I did."

"Then tell me again about Snow. You're absolutely certain you didn't see her? Either time?"

Another pause, longer this time. When he spoke again, his tone had shifted from concern to something else entirely. "Why do you care so much about that cat, Audrey?"

His voice dropped lower, attempting sympathy but landing somewhere near condescension. "Is it because Blake gave her to you?"

The question hit like ice water, "No, it has nothing to do with Blake."

Snow had been my emotional anchor these past two years. Even if she hadn't been a gift from Blake - if she'd just been a stray I'd taken in-I wouldn't abandon her after two years together. But James wasn't interested
in my explanation.

"Seriously, Audrey. I watched you stand up in front of everyone, declaring your independence. It was... impressive. Bold. But now? Clinging to some pet Blake gave you?"

I closed my eyes in resignation. "James. Simple question. Did you see my cat or not?"

I hadn't called for his analysis of my emotional state. I needed information,not another person telling me how to feel.

"No."He answered.

"I see." Another thought surfaced, demanding attention. "One more thing.Astrid says my apartment looks ransacked. Did you do that last night?"

"No, I didn't touch anything."

"Got it, thanks." I narrowed my eyes and suddenly smiled. "I'll have Astrid arrange something appropriate. To show my...appreciation for last night's assistance."

The line went dead before he could respond.

"Alright, let's go now," I said, managing a slight smile at Ethan.


The harsh fluorescent lights of the hospital corridor seemed to reflect my heavy mood when my phone lit up with James's name. Was he calling to apologize for his tone earlier? The thought only made me more irritated.


Before I could silence it, Ethan's hand appeared from nowhere, deftly plucking the phone from my grasp. His eyes sparkled with mischief."Allow me."
James's voice came through immediately, polished and apologetic: "Audrey,sorry for being too harsh earlier. The lack of sleep,the workload today-"

"Hello, sir!" Ethan's cheerful interruption echoed slightly as we squeezed into the crowded elevator. He maneuvered us toward the back,using his height to create a small pocket of space around me -a gesture so natural it seemed unconscious.

His voice took on an almost musical quality. "I'm Audrey's brother. She's looking for her cat, unavailable now. Are there any messages you want to leave?"

The stunned silence on the other end was almost audible. "Brother? What brother?"

"Listen up, sir." Ethan gave a smile. "Quick question - what exactly makes you think you can dictate what my sister does with her own pet? Last time I checked, Audrey's pretty capable of making her own decisions."

He ended the call with a flourish, handing my phone back. "Word of advice? That guy's got 'future control freak' written all over him. Next thing you know,he'll be installing a whiteboard in your living room for daily relationship lectures."

A laugh bubbled up before I could stop it. The moment felt lighter, freer.


Then the elevator doors slid open, and two faces I'd been desperately hoping to avoid stood waiting in the lobby. Laurel Rose and Blake Parker.


"Miss Sinclair." The moment she spotted me, she immediately let out a cold smile.


"Blake was at your place this morning looking for you," she called out, her voice carrying just enough to draw attention without seeming to try."
Hiding at Mayo Clinic?"

A delicate pause. Her manicured nail tapped thoughtfully against her chin."It's almost brilliant. Who'd think to look for you in New York's most prestigious medical facility?" Another pause, this one heavy with implication. "And even if they did - well, what better excuse for missing a divorce appointment than a medical emergency?"

I met her gaze steadily, refusing to give her the satisfaction of a reaction."
Careful. Miss Rose. Your implication is showing."

"Everyone knows Mayo Clinic only takes serious cases." Her smile turned razor-sharp.

"Indeed." I allowed myself a small, cold smile. "So what's your role here,
Miss Rose? Terminal patient? Rare disease sufferer?"

"Or is this just another audition?"

The color vanished from her face so quickly. She stumbled back a step,one trembling hand reaching for Blake's arm with unerring accuracy despite her apparent distress.

"Enough." Blake finally spoke up as he moved to shield her.

"Laurel needs treatment. You have no right to question her presence here."


The gesture was so familiar it almost hurt- how many times had he protected me like that? A hint of bitterness surged in my heart,and I slightly shook my head to get rid of it.

I said with a resigned smile, "Well, you're right. May I leave now?"

"No," Blake answered, his eyes narrowing. " I almost thought you were
actually serious about the divorce this time." Sarcasm was evident in his voice. "If you didn't want the divorce, why create such an unsightly scene?"

He continued. "It's not just the Parker family now -even outsiders know about our divorce proceedings. Even Grandfather has agreed to it. So how do you plan to wrap this up?"

"As I said, with divorce," I answered my own question, my voice steady despite the tremor in my hands.
###Chapter 47: I'd Like to Meet That Patient

**Audrey's POV**

Blake's expression immediately darkened, but before he could respond,I pressed on. "Blake, I missed the court appointment because I had a severe stomach attack last night. My friend was worried and brought me to the hospital."

I forced myself to maintain eye contact, even as memories of last night's pain threatened to overwhelm me. "The doctors insist on a 24-hour observation period before discharge. That's why I couldn't make it to court this morning."

I took a careful breath, steadying myself. "I won't drag out the divorce.Any day this week works for me. Just set a time." A bitter smile touched my lips as I added, "If I'm still alive, I'll be there."

At those words, Blake's eyes narrowed slightly,his harsh expression softening almost imperceptibly. For a moment, I thought I caught a glimpse of concern in his features - that familiar look from years past when he actually cared about my wellbeing. But before I could be sure, the moment passed.

Laurel, who had been watching our exchange with barely concealed satisfaction, let out a delicate laugh. "Miss Sinclair, was eating such spicy Southern food last night a calculated move? Knowing you had the divorce appointment today?" She rose her hand to cover her mouth in mock concern. "I wonder what method you'll use to land yourself in the hospital next time?"


"Could you not make such unpleasant insinuations?" Ethan's voice cut through the tension as he stepped forward from behind me. "What do you
mean by calculated move'? If she really wanted to avoid the divorce, she has a hundred ways to stall. She wouldn't need to resort to harming herself!"

Blake's attention snapped to Ethan, his brows furrowing dangerously."The dancer from The Underground?" His gaze flickered between us,something dark flashing in his expression. "I thought having James Collins at your apartment late last night was bad enough. Now another one shows up."

He let out a harsh laugh. "Audrey Sinclair, you look quite popular, huh?"

I felt my heart skip a beat, finding these cruel words momentarily stole my breath. After our three years of marriage, this was what he thought of me?

"Watch your mouth," Ethan's voice carried a hint of steel beneath its casual tone. "Mr. Parker, perhaps we got off on the wrong foot. I'm just a college student trying to make ends meet with part-time work."

"And I'm here to do my friend a favor and take care of Miss Sinclair."

"First The Underground, now here." Blake's voice clearly showed his anger.
"That's quite a convenient pattern of running into my wife."

"The glamorous life of a student," Ethan's laugh held a hint of challenge."We show up wherever the money is. Though fair warning - next time you spot me, I might be delivering your lunch order to Parker Group." His casual tone made the subtle dig even sharper.


His hand found my elbow with gentle pressure. "Now, if you'll excuse us,we have some pressing matters to handle." His gaze flickered meaningfully to Laurel. "I'm sure you're eager to get back to your.., patient. Whatever mysterious condition brought this beauty to Mayo Clinic must be *terribly*
serious."

I could see Blake's hands into fists. Before he could respond, Ethan wvas already guiding me past them.

We'd only made it a few steps when something clicked in my mind.I stopped abruptly, turning back to face them.

I studied Blake's features for a moment before speaking up, "One more thing. Mr. Parker." My voice was cold. "Breaking and entering is a serious offense. Even for you. And don't forget about our little wager at the race track."

"It would be such a shame," I added softly, "if Astrid and I had to explain to New York society why Blake Parker couldn't honor a simple bet."

Without waiting for his response, I reached back to grasp Ethan's arm.The gesture was deliberate - let Blake make whatever assumptions he wanted. We walked away, our footsteps echoing in perfect sync down the hospital corridor.

**Laurel's POV**

The moment Audrey disappeared down the corridor,something shifted in Blake's expression. He took half a step forward, as if to follow, and I felt a flutter of panic in my chest as I quickly found his arm.


"Blake darling, don't let them bother you." I let my voice tremble just enough. "The department head is waiting,and you know how particular he is about his schedule."


I gazed up at him. "After all, my condition... it should take precedence over her little performances, shouldn't it?"
After hearing my words, he halted his steps and led me into the elevator.
All the way, Blake remained silent, something I couldn't read in his expression.

Seeing him like this, I recalled the look on his face in the morning.When he mentioned that Audrey didn't show up in court and was reluctant to divorce, there was a sigh, yet also a sense of relief. Now, looking at his current state...

I clenched my fists so tightly that my fingernails dug into the palms of my hands.

*Could it be that Blake isn't as eager for this divorce as he claims?*

The department head's summons came the moment we reached the oncology floor, drawing Blake into his office with talk of test results and treatment protocol, while I walked toward Dr. Evans' desk.

"Dr. Evans." I pitched my voice low. "About our discussion regarding that particular patient..."

Dr. Evans' response was cold and professional. "Yes, I spoke with her."The barely concealed disgust in her tone made it clear exactly what she thought of my request.

"And is she still here? Actually, I'd so appreciate the chance to meet her."My eyes flickered toward Blake's silhouette in the department head's office before returning to Evans.

"To see firsthand what someone in the final stages of gastric cancer experiences,"
###Chapter 48: You Want to Be My Boyfriend?

**Audrey's POV**

The evening air carried a hint of chill as Ethan andI I reached my apartment complex. The exhaustion from our hospital encounter with Blake and Laurel still lingered. Just as we approached the entrance, my phone buzzed with Dr. Evans' name lighting upthe screen.

"Audrey." Her voice carried an unusual tension. "Remember that patient who wanted to use the same experimental treatment as you?"

My fingers tightened around the phone. "Yes, what's wrong?"

"This... lady. She's here at Mayo Clinic and wants to meet with you..."


"I'm sorry, but I have an emergency to deal with." I refused directly, my patience wearing thin at the mere thought of this mysterious 'collaboration'proposal.

Dr. Evans' hesitation was audible through the phone. "Audrey, she's quite..."She trailed off, clearly uncomfortable with the implied pressure from above.


"Look," I softened my tone, knowing this wasn't her fault. "Just telI her I'm at the police station right now - my child is missing." The lie slipped out smoothly, born of desperation. "I'm sure someone of her... standing can understand that takes precedence."

A beat of silence. "She can have her lawyers reach out another time."I added pointedly, "That was the original plan this morning, wasn't it?"

"I..." Dr. Evans sighed, her voice showing her understanding and concern."Yes, of course. I'll let her know. And Audrey? I truly hope you find your..
.child. Don't lose hope."

The kindness in her voice made my throat tight. She knew I had lost my child, so I understood that she was trying to comfort me. "Thank you,"I managed, the words barely a whisper.

As I ended the call, my gaze drifted to the darkening sky. The excuse wasn't entirely a lie - Snow was as close to a child as I'd ever have now.

I shook my head and looked at Ethan by my side, "Come on,we've got a cat to find."

He had drifted to lean against a nearby street lamp. A hint of amusement played at the corners of his mouth. "So you can lie that smoothly when you want to."

I frowned, and looked at him with confusion. "Is it wrong to tell a white lie to avoid people I don't want to see right now?"

"I'm not judging the lie itself." His expression turned thoughtful. "I'm just wondering... if you can lie so easily, why didn't you let Blake think there was something between us when we ran into him?"

The question hit closer to home than I would have liked. I started walking toward my building, but Ethan wasn't done.

"He's got Laurel hanging all over him. Why can't you have someone new by your side?"

"There's no point." I shook my head.

"Why not try?" His voice carried a playful challenge. "Maybe he'd get jealous."
A cold laugh escaped me. "Impossible."

Blake Parker, jealous? The man who woke from his coma two years ago with only four words for me: "Get out. Now. Leave."

I'd spent countless nights by his bedside, changing IVs, monitoring vitals,whispering prayers to a God I wasn't sure I believed in anymore. I'd seen every moment of his vulnerability, every second of weakness.

It was a cruel irony. The very acts that had bound me to him were exactly what made it impossible for him to love me. The closer I'd tried to be, the more walls I'd unknowingly built.

"How do you know it's impossible if you won't even try?" Ethan's voice cut through my thoughts.

"Why are you so insistent?" I faced him, feeling the exhaustion in every muscle. "You want to be my boyfriend?"

"Would that be so bad?" The streetlights caught the mischief in his eyes.


"Young man,that's not a funny joke."

"Just kidding." His tone softened slightly. "But I am curious - you two seem to have no feelings left, yet you're still not divorced. Why?"

"That's none of your business. Stop asking."

A sharp gust of wind cut through the evening air, and I couldn't suppress a shiver.Before I could protest, Ethan was already shrugging off his jacket.

"Here," He draped it over my shoulders with casual grace, "You're shaking.



"I don't need-" My attempt to remove it was gently but firmly stopped.
"Okay, I was wrong to pry." His voice carried genuine remorse."Let me make it up to you-I'll help search for Snow all night if that's what it takes.Deal?"

When I hesitated, he added, "You're already weak, and if you catch a cold and end up back in the hospital. Snow will be out here alone even longer."

The logic was sound. After a moment's consideration, I let my hands drop from the jacket's edges.

We started our search methodically. First stop was the local convenience store for cat food. Armed with flashlights and Snow's favorite treats,we began combing through the complex grounds.

"Snow!" My voice echoed off brick walls and concrete paths. "Snow, where are you?"

Hour after hour passed1. Each corner checked, each bush investigated, each meow examined only to find yet another stray that wasn't Snow. The hope that had sustained me began to fade with the night's deepening shadows.

By the time the clock struck ten, exhaustion had settled deep in my bones.My voice was growing hoarse from calling, and even the simple act of holding the flashlight had become a struggle.

"We should stop before we disturb the neighbors." Ethan's voice was gentle but firm.


That's when the tears started. Silent at first, then building into something that shook my entire frame.

"Hey... please don't cry,"

"What if..." The words caught in my throat. "What if we never find Snow...
"What if she never comes back..."
"I'm such a failure..." The dam finally broke. "I couldn't even protect my cat..."

The sobs that tore from my chest held years of unshed tears. All the times I hadn't cried - losing my baby, seeing Blake with Laurel, enduring the Parker family's contempt - it all came pouring out now.

God, five years. Five freaking years since that crazy day at the beach.Blake showed up out of nowhere - beaten up, blind, completely helpless.Rachel was with me when we found him. I had no clue he was the CEO of the Parker Group. I spent weeks taking care of him, changing his bandages,helping him eat, talk... somewhere along the way, I fell for him. Hard. It was stupid- I mean, he couldn't even see me. Then his family swooped in and just.:. took him away. I thought that was it.

But fate had other plans. Three years ago, when news broke that Blake had fallen into a coma, I couldn't stay away. I went straight to William Parker, his grandfather, and made an impossible request - to marry Blake,to care for him, to stand by him even if he never woke up.

Those once-sweet memories now only sent waves of pain through me.

*Why would I get a punishment like this* The thought rose unbidden through my tears.


I'd lost my love and my child, received a death sentence from my doctors,and now even Snow - my last source of unconditional love - was gone.
###Chapter 49: Don't Drag Ethan Into This
Audrey's POV
Tears blurred my vision under the flickering street lamp. Ethan hovered nearby, his usual confidence replaced by an awkward, earnest concern. He fumbled in his pockets, finally producing a crumpled tissue.
"Hey, please don't cry..." His voice carried a gentle uncertainty. "We’ll find Snow. I’ll help you search every block until we do."
The kindness in his tone only made the tears fall faster. I pressed my palms against my eyes, trying to maintain some semblance of composure, but the weight of the day was too much to bear.
"Audrey," Ethan said softly. Sensing my distress, he stepped closer, offering a supportive embrace. His college varsity jacket was heavy and warm against my cheek. It wasn't the touch I was used to, but it was the first time in a long time someone had offered me comfort without expecting something in return.
"It’s past midnight," he whispered with a nervous laugh, trying to lighten the mood. "If you keep this up, the neighbors might think I’m kidnapping you."
The absurdity of the moment—a young student trying to comfort a dying woman over a lost cat—almost brought a smile to my lips. Almost.
"Listen," he continued, "I’ve heard that cats have incredible homing instincts. Maybe she’s trying to find her way back to somewhere familiar... somewhere you used to live."
I pulled back slightly, my voice a mere whisper. "Do you really think so?"
Before Ethan could answer, the street was suddenly flooded with the blinding glare of high-beams. A sleek, black sedan pulled up to the curb with a predatory purr. Blake Parker emerged from the car, the glowing tip of a cigar illuminating his sharp, handsome features.
"Well, well," he said, his voice carrying a dangerous, rhythmic edge. "And here I thought you were insisting at the clinic that there was nothing between you two."
"Blake," I said, my voice trembling as I tried to step away from Ethan. But Ethan, sensing the hostility, instinctively kept a hand on my shoulder, drawing me closer to his side.
"Earlier today, there was nothing," Ethan said, his voice ringing with a defiance that made my blood run cold. "But after seeing how you treat her? Things change. You got a problem with that?"
Blake’s brow furrowed, his gaze shifting to me. I was caught in a paralyzing dilemma. Ethan was lying to protect my dignity, but if I let this lie stand, Blake’s retaliation could ruin the boy's future.
"Silence is consent, isn't it, Mr. Parker?" Ethan’s mocking tone cut through the air. "Audrey’s made her choice. Why don't you head back to your actress?"
Blake let out a cold, humorless laugh. "So you’ve found a spokesperson, Audrey?" He began to walk toward us, each step measured and heavy.
"Blake, stop," I finally found my voice, stepping in front of Ethan to shield him. "This is between us. Don’t drag him into our mess."
Blake's POV
As I advanced, the sight of that boy’s varsity jacket draped over Audrey’s shoulders triggered something dark and primal in my chest.
In an instant, memories of us flooded back—moments in our private garden where I’d draped my suit jacket over her shivering shoulders, the way she would lean into my warmth with a trust that I had once taken for granted. Those were days when I’d almost forgotten the complexities of our arrangement, when I’d nearly lost myself in the quiet peace of our marriage.
Now, she stood wrapped in another man's protection. Someone younger. Someone who looked at her with an idealism I had long since lost.
I narrowed my eyes. This boy was provoking me, clearly trying to stand up for her. But seeing the vulnerability in Audrey’s eyes—a vulnerability that even James Collins hadn't been able to evoke—sent a jolt of uncertainty through me.
"Audrey Sinclair," I said, my voice dropping to a low, commanding frequency.
"Leave her out of this," Ethan replied instantly, stepping in front of her. "Back off."
Audrey's POV
Ethan’s grip was firm as he tried to pull me away from the brewing confrontation. My heart raced, the memory of the chaos at the hospital still fresh in my mind.
"Let me go, Ethan," I whispered, twisting in his hold. But his athletic frame was an immovable barrier.
"I've got this," he muttered, his jaw set with determination.
A dark chuckle cut through the tension. Blake stood watching us, hands casually tucked into his pockets, radiating a lethal calm.
"How touching," Blake said, his voice dripping with amusement. "Playing the hero for a woman who doesn't even tell you her real name? How desperately predictable."
He stepped closer, his shadow falling over us both. "Stop the theatrics, Audrey. You know very well that if I wanted to handle this situation, I wouldn't need to lift a finger."


###Chapter 50: I Will Destroy You

Audrey's POV
Blake’s words froze me mid-motion. That low, precise tone was a warning—a signal that he was no longer playing games.
"Is that your only move?" Ethan’s voice crackled with the righteous indignation of youth. "Threatening people just because you can't control the situation?" He shifted, stepping slightly in front of me, his posture defiant despite the overwhelming presence of the man before us.
Blake didn't flinch. Instead, he pulled out his phone with a slow, deliberate grace that was more terrifying than any shout.
"Ethan Davies," Blake said, his voice carrying a casual, lethal menace. "A promising senior at NYU. Excellent grades, a bright future in sports science. Even a few prestigious grad school applications pending."
The streetlight caught the predatory gleam in Blake's eyes as he scrolled. "And then there’s your family. A hardworking sister, isn't she? Currently excelling in her SAT prep. It would be a tragedy if such a promising trajectory were... interrupted."
I watched the color drain from Ethan's face. The young man who had been so boldly protective just moments ago now looked like prey realizing the trap had already sprung.
"Stop it!" Ethan’s voice shook. "How do you even know about her?"
"My assistant pulled your file during the drive over," Blake said, checking his watch with chilling indifference. "It took less than ten minutes. Imagine what I could do with an hour."
A tremor ran through Ethan’s shoulders. He was brave, yes, but he was no match for the ruthless machinery of the Parker Group.
"Here is the truth, boy," Blake said, his presence filling the street. "I don't care about your life or your family. But if you think you can interfere in my private affairs without consequence, you are deeply mistaken. I can dismantle your future without even breaking a sweat."
He lit a fresh cigar, the smoke curling between us like a physical barrier. His gaze finally settled on me. "Audrey Sinclair. Last chance. Tell me what this really is."
Seeing his "fangs" exposed so clearly—not just as a businessman, but as the man I had lived with for three years—made my stomach churn. I stepped away from Ethan, knowing I had to end this before Blake did something irreparable.
"There is nothing between us," I said, my voice sounding like ash. "Everything he said was a lie. He’s just someone I hired to help me search for my cat."
Blake took a long drag of his cigar, his lips curling into a cold, triumphant smile. "Come here."
I walked to his side, each step heavy with the guilt of reducing Ethan’s genuine kindness to a transactional lie. Blake draped an arm across my shoulders—a theatrical display of possession.
"You're punching way above your weight class, kid," Blake said to Ethan. "She’s still my wife."
I saw the light go out in Ethan’s eyes. The boy who had made me laugh during the darkest night of my life now stood deflated.
"If you're done," I whispered, looking up at Blake, "take me home."

The drive back was silent, the air in the car heavy with unspoken accusations. When the engine finally died outside my building, the driver stepped out, leaving us in a stifling, confined silence.
I reached for the door handle, but the locks were engaged. Before I could protest, Blake shifted, his broad frame blocking my path. He didn't use force, but his sheer presence felt like a cage. He caught my chin, forcing me to meet his gaze.
"I’ve never seen you defend anyone like that," he said, his voice dangerously soft. "What makes a college kid so special to you?"
"I didn't want him to pay for our mistakes," I said, trying to maintain my composure. "Blake, it doesn't matter. We are getting divorced anyway."
"Are we? You set the date and then vanished. Is that what you call wanting a divorce?"
He leaned closer, his breath warm against my skin. His gaze was intense, scanning my face as if searching for a lie. He leaned down, his lips brushing against the line of my neck in a way that brought back a flood of memories—three years of a marriage that had been a desert of emotion, punctuated by moments of intense, confusing proximity.
He moved to pull back the collar of my hoodie, perhaps to see me more clearly, perhaps out of a habit of dominance. But the moment his hand moved the fabric aside, his entire body went rigid.
The air in the car turned from heated to arctic in a heartbeat. Whatever he saw—the stark prominence of my collarbones or the surgical tape from my recent procedure—made him recoil as if burned.
When he finally spoke, his voice was hollow, stripped of all its earlier arrogance.
"Get out."
###Chapter 51: Mrs. Parker Is Running after Us
Audrey's POV
I let my eyes fall closed, momentarily lost in the weight of the silence.
Though I had resigned myself to the divorce, there was no denying the gravity Blake Parker exerted in such close proximity. Three years of marriage had left deep grooves in my heart, a dangerous familiarity that made my resistance feel like a crumbling fortress. Despite the hurt and the betrayal, a part of me still craved the security I once thought his presence provided.
As he leaned closer, the tension in the car reached a breaking point. For a fleeting second, I wondered: One last time? To remember what we were before we became enemies?
But just as the atmosphere shifted, Blake suddenly pulled back. The fragile peace shattered like glass, leaving me exposed and cold.
I blinked, staring up at him in confusion. "Blake? What’s wrong?"
"It seems you haven't been lacking company lately, Miss Sinclair." His cold laugh cut through the air like a blade. His gaze dropped pointedly to my neck, his eyes darkening with a dangerous intensity. "Was it James Collins? Or perhaps that boy you were clinging to tonight?"
His accusation hit me like a physical blow. I looked down, my fingers brushing against the sensitive skin of my collarbone. I realized then what he was looking at—the red marks left over from the intense pressure treatment at the spa yesterday.
I remembered Astrid’s teasing voice: "Trust me, with Blake’s temper, he’ll mistake these marks for something far more scandalous."
I let out a soft, bitter laugh. My best friend knew my husband better than I did; she had predicted his reaction down to the exact shade of fury in his eyes.
However, my smile only fueled his fire. His face darkened. "I have maintained a standard of conduct for the sake of our families," he said icily, "yet here you are, entangled with others, showing the evidence of your 'freedom' before the papers are even processed."
The irony was suffocating. Here he was, the man planning a high-profile engagement to Laurel, playing the role of the betrayed husband.
"Get out," he commanded, his voice devoid of warmth.
"Fine."
I didn't bother to explain. What was the point? He had already written his own version of history, just as he had for every day of our marriage. I pushed open the car door, the night air hitting me like a cold slap. I adjusted my hoodie, my fingers trembling as I walked toward my building. Three months left, I reminded myself. I don’t have time for this.
My phone suddenly vibrated. It was Ethan.
"Hey, it's me," he said, sounding urgent. "I just noticed something on my jacket. There are white cat hairs on the shoulder—Snow’s hair. I wasn't near her today, Audrey. That means..."
My heart stuttered. The only person who had been close enough to Ethan to transfer those traces was Blake, during their confrontation.
"Blake," I whispered. He had been near my cat. He knew where she was.
I spun around just as the sedan’s headlights flared to life. "Wait!" I shouted, breaking into a run. "Blake, wait! I need to know!"
Blake's POV
"Sir, she’s running after us," the driver noted, looking in the rearview mirror.
I reclined in my seat, closing my eyes. "Keep driving."
After what I’d seen—the protective embrace of that student, the marks on her neck—I wasn't interested in more excuses. She had made her choice to leave my world; let her see how far she could get on her own.
"Sir..." The driver hesitated, the car slowing. "She... she’s fallen."
My eyes snapped open. In the mirror’s reflection, I saw Audrey struggling to her feet, a small, vulnerable silhouette against the vast emptiness of the street. A sharp pang of something I refused to call guilt pierced through my anger.
"Turn back," I snapped. "Now!"
Audrey's POV
I stood in the darkness, catching my breath, until the headlights swept over me again. The car reversed smoothly, the window sliding down to reveal Blake’s face—a mask of studied indifference.
"Get in," he said.
I climbed back into the car, my heart hammering. I immediately pulled back my collar, pressing my fingers firmly against the skin next to the existing marks.
"Look," I said, tilting my head to the light. Within seconds, a new, identical red mark blossomed under the pressure. "It’s a reaction to the spa treatment I had yesterday. The trainee was far too aggressive with the massage tools."
His eyes narrowed as he studied the evidence. "Explain the smile, then."
"I was smiling at the absurdity of it," I said, my voice steadier now. "Astrid warned me you’d jump to the worst possible conclusion. She was right."
He turned to stare out the window, but I caught the slight softening of his jaw. "She has a childish sense of humor."
I felt a wave of relief wash over me. He believed me. For a moment, the wall of hostility between us lowered.
He began rolling up his sleeves, his movements slow and deliberate. "So that’s it? You risked a fall in the middle of the night just to prove your 'innocence' regarding a spa treatment?"
His voice dropped lower, the earlier anger replaced by a different, more complex tension. "Or did you realize you weren't quite ready to say goodbye?"

###Chapter 52: It's for A Cat?

**Audrey's POV**

Blake's words were heavy with implications. I opened my mouth to respond, but the words died in my throat as memories of our earlier encounter flooded back.


"No, I..." The rest of my sentence dissolved into silence as Blake smoothly exited the car. Before I could process what was happening, he'd circled around to my side, opening the door with practiced elegance.

The night air hit my face, a sharp contrast to the warmth of the car's interior. But before I could step out, strong arms slipped beneath my knees and behind my back, lifting me with effortless grace.

A startled gasp escaped my lips as I instinetively wrapped my arms around his neck for balance. The familiar scent of him wrapped around me like a forgotten memory.

A hint of satisfaction flickered across his features as we approached my building.

"Didn't you say that you'd be better off without me?" His voice carried a particular blend of arrogance and amusement. "You've lost weight again.Too much."


Hearing his words, I found myself sinking deeper into his embrace, my head finding that perfect spot between his shoulder and neck that felt like it had been carved just for me.

I should explain. Should struggle. Should maintain the boundaries I'd so carefully constructed when I'd moved out. After all, this was the man who'
d already planned his engagement party to another woman. The man who'd made it clear, time and time again, that our marriage meant nothing.


But five years of loving him, three years of marriage, two periods of devoted care - during his blindness and later his coma - had left their mark on my heart. I couldn't just erase that kind of muscle memory with logic alone. Each remembered moment of care felt like another crack in my carefully constructed walls.

*Focus*, I reminded myself sternly. I needed to play this carefully if I wanted Snow back.


Knowing Blake's nature, if I pushed too hard about Snow's whereabouts like I had about the divorce, I'd end up with the same result - nothing.I could wait him out on the divorce until his engagement to Laurel forced his hand, but Snow was different.


He'd never liked her, always sneering when he saw me holding her,suggesting I get rid of her. One wrong move, one hint of defiance, and he might just do exactly that.

The fluorescent lights in my apartment complex flickered weakly as he carried me through the doorway. Despite Astrid's earlier attempts at tidying up, her chaotic nature was evident everywhere -books stacked at odd angles, throw pillows arranged with more enthusiasm than skill,everything just slightly off-kilter. Her efforts had somehow made the modest space feel even more cramped.

"Millions in monthly allowance," Blake's lip curled as he took in the surroundings, his disdain palpable. "and this is where you choose to live?"

Still cradled in his arms, I felt heat rise to my cheeks. "It feels like... home,"I offered weakly.
The truth caught in my throat - that every penny of his "allowance" had gone to experimental cancer treatments and desperate attempts to save our baby. The money had disappeared faster than autumn leaves in a storm.

A dark chuckle escaped him. "HHome? All I smell is poverty."

The couch creaked slightly as he set me down, but before I could create any distance between us, his weight pressed me deeper into the cushions.His fingers found my hoodie's collar, and suddenly breathing became a forgotten skill.

He suddenly yanked at my hoodie's collar, exposing more skin. His mouth descended on my neck with bruising intensity, deliberately adding new marks alongside the existing ones. The pain made me wince, but I didn't pull away.

When he finally lifted his head, his eyes stúdied the marks carefully,comparing the ones he'd just made with those from the spa. The tension that had been radiating from him since our encounter with Ethan finally seemed to dissipate.

A smile tugged at my lips despte everything. Who would have thought?Blake Parker - New York's most feared CEO - could be so childishly possessive.

His eyes caught my amusement, darkening dangerously. Before I could process his reaction, his hand gripped my jaw, tilting my face up as his mouth claímed mine with devastating thoroughness.

The temperature in the room seemed to spike as the kiss deepened.Everything else faded away - the cramped apartment, my illness,the impending divorce - leaving only the scorching heat between us.
"I thought Mrs. Parker would have forgotten all about me by now," he breathed against my ear, his voice rough with desire. "Living such an...entertaining life out here."

His hands slid lower, drawing a gasp from my lips. "But you're still just as responsive as ever."


"Blake," I managed between quickening breaths, "I need to ask you something."


"What is it?" His voice held a hint of amusement. "Faster? Slower?"

Heat flooded my face, painting my cheeks a deep crimson. Even through the haze of desire, I hadn't forgotten my mission. "Snow's missing," I managed between quickened breaths. "I need your help finding her."

Blake's eyebrow arched, a dangerous glint flickering in his dark eyes. "So all this... enthusiasm," his voice dropped to a silken purr, "is for a cat?"

I met his gaze through half-lidded eyes, letting my lips curve into the kind of smile I knew would get under his skin. "Yes." My legs tightened around his waist deliberately, drawing him closer as I whispered, "I'm at your mercy."


After three years of marriage, I knew exactly what buttons to push, what responses would feed his need for dominance. The sharp intake of his breath confirmed I'd hit my mark.

A predatory smile spread across his features as he examined my flushed face, "Well then," he murmured, his voice rough with promise, "I suppose I could help."

The next moment, his mouth claimed mine with bruising intensity,stealing any response I might have made. The small living room seemed
to shrink around us as the temperature spiked, the air growing thick with tension and unspoken desires...

Morning light filtered through thin curtains, painting patterns across my ceiling as consciousness slowly returned. Every muscle in my body protested as I forced my eyes open, only to find Blake already dressed in an impeccable silver-gray suit, lounging in my modest armchair with casual elegance.

"You're awake." It wasn't a question.

"You... stayed?" The words slipped out before I could stop them.

His lips curved into that familiar smirk. "Disappointed?"

"No. just... used to waking up alone."

I pushed myself into a sitting position, wincing slightly. "Would you like breakfast?"


"Michael already brought something." He rolled his eyes slightly. "If I waited for you to cook, I'd starve to death."


Twenty minutes later, freshly showered and changed, I sat across from him at my small table, devouring the gourmet breakfast his assistant had arranged, while Blake stared at me. "You never ate like this before."

I swallowed a mouthful of scrambled eggs. "That was all an act.Don't need to pretend anymore."

His expression shifted subtly, then he spoke again. "Finish up. You're coming with me."

Confused, I asked, "Where?"
"Don't you remember what you begged for last night?"

"Snow!" I let the right amount of hope color my voice,careful not to reveal that I already suspected where she was."Did you find her?"

He leaned back in his chair, regarding me with calculated intensity.

"First, I have some questions for you."
###Chapter 53:Why Did You Bring Miss Sinclai Here?

**Audrey's POV**

I nodded slightly. "Go ahead, ask."


"That call the other night," he began, his voice carrying a hint of dangerous edge. "What was that about? Why didn't you answer when I called back?"


My fingers twisted in my lap. "I... dialed wrong." The lie felt clumsy on my tongue. "When I saw you calling back, I didn't know how to explain,so I just... didn't answer."

"Really?" His eyes narrowed slightly. "Who were you trying to call then?James Collins?"


The way he said James's name made my stomach clench. I shook my head quickly, perhaps too quickly. "No, of course not."

Blake leaned back in his chair, but there was nothing relaxed in his posture. "Interesting. After you ignored my call, I met him in that Southern restaurant, and he looked a bit hurried. Later, when I went to your apartment. I ran into him again at your doorstep."

My eyes widened in shock. "Wait, you came to my apartment that night?"

"You called without speaking, then wouldn't answer." His voice carried something I couldn't quite identify. "I thought you might be dead in there."

Blake let out a cold laugh, "So I went to check on you. What's the most interesting part? He said you were already asleep. Do you know how I felt
at that moment?"

I didn't respond as my mind was spinning.

I had just learned that after taking me to the hospital. James had gone back to my apartment to look for my medication logs.


But he never mentioned anything about seeing Blake that night...

"Audrey Sinclair." Blake's eyes narrowed as he studied my face. "Were you really asleep then?"


I snapped back to reality, quickly shaking my head. "No, no I wasn't."

I couldn't understand why James would claim I was asleep. At that hour,for a man to leave a woman's apartment saying she was already asleep -wasn't he just inviting misunderstandings?

Blake continued. "So when James said you wanted to cut ties with the past,that you didn't want the cat we raised together anymore... was that really your decision?"


"What?" My mind exploded with sudden understanding. "No! I never said I didn't want Snow! I wasn't even home that night!"

Tears pricked at my eyes as understanding dawned. "Astrid searched all day yesterday, and I looked all night."

*So Snow wasn't lost - James gave her to Blake that night?* The thought made my chest ache. *No wonder James sounded so strange when I called about Snow yesterday.*

I bit my lip. "Last night I was desperate, that's why I tried asking for your help..."
Something shifted in Blake's expression as he watched the tears gather in my eyes. The arctic chill in his gaze thawed slightly, replaced by a hint of satisfaction.


"I see." He stood with fluid grace. "I almost thought you really didn't want
Snow anymore."


I quickly shook my head, grabbing a tissue to wipe my face. "That's not possible."


Snow was my last attachment and support in this world. Even if I had given up on myself. I could never give up on her.

Blake's lips curved into a slight smile as he walked to my side.He wrapped an arm around my shoulders, guiding me toward the door."Come on. Let's go."

It wasn't until we were in the elevator that my emotions finally settled enough for me to notice our position - Blake's arm still wrapped firmly around my shoulders.


*This intimacy feels inappropriate for a divorcing couple*, I thought hazily.

I bit my lip, instinctively trying to pull away from his arm, but Blake only tightened his hold. "Don't want to see Snow anymore?"

Snow was my weakness, and Blake knew it too well. Though I couldn't understand why he'd maintain such intimacy when he'd,already decided on divorce, I found myself yielding.

After three years of marriage, he'd taken whatever he wanted from me.What difference would this moment make?

And so, I let Blake guide me to his car.
Blake's car glided to a stop outside Lunar Mansion.

The familiar gates stood tall, guarding the place full of memories I'd tried to forget. The manicured gardens, the marble fountain,the sweeping driveway-everything exactly as I'd left it two weeks ago.


I never thought I'd see this place again. The day I walked away,clutching Snow to my chest like a lifeline after losing our baby, I'd been so certain.So final. Yet here I was, unable to break free completely.

"Out." Blake's command cut through my reminiscing, his voice carrying that familiar mix of authority and impatience.


I pulled myself from the car,steadying my nerves with a deep breath. But before I could take a single step toward the entrance, his hand caught my arm. The touch was different from his earlier possessive grip - lighter,almost hesitant. When his fingers slid down to intertwine with mine,the gesture felt so foreign it nearly stopped my heart.

His palm burned against mine as he led me toward the mansion, his steps steady. I couldn't help stealing glances at his profile,trying to read something- anything - in that controlled expression.

This gentle contact was so unlike him. The Blake I knew had always maintained careful distance, treating physical touch like a weapon to be wielded rather than a comfort to be shared. Now, his fingers wrapped arounad mine with a warmth that felt almost... protective.

"Blake darling, you're home!"

Laurel's voice cut through my thoughts like a knife. She stood in the doorway wearing a soft pink loungewear set, a matching pink apron tied around her waist. She held a spatula in her right hand, completing her
carefully crafted picture of domestic bliss.

The moment her eyes landed on our joined hands, that carefully crafted warmth shattered. Her lips trembled as she turned to Blake. "Why didyou...bring Miss Sinclair here?"


The irony of her words almost made me laugh. This was our marital home-mine and Blake's - where we'd created the few precious moments of happiness I'd been allowed to keep.I never imagined he'd bring her here,let her play house in the spaces where my dreams had lived and died.

Before Blake could respond, I slipped my hand from his grasp. "Don't worry. I'm just here for Snow."


Without bothering to respond, I moved past her into the house. The brief contact of our shoulders was barely enough to disturb air, but Laurel's reaction was just too dramatic. She staggered backward, one hand flying to her shoulder while the other pressed against her heart.

I didn't slow my stride, didn't turn back. Let her play her games. The moment I stepped into the living room, reality landed a far harder blow than any theatrical shoulder bump.


Three years of marriage, distilled into what remained: nothing. Our wedding portrait had been replaced by a towering glamour shot of Laurel.The warm, earthy tones I'd chosen to make this house feel like home had been stripped away, repainted in shades of pink that felt like a deliberate erasure of my existence.

Half a month. That's all it had taken to transform three years of memories into a shrine to Laurel Rose.

I drew in a deep breath, forcing down the emotions threatening to
overwhelm me. *Even though I knew this day would come, it still hurts.*

But I couldn't afford to dwell on it. Somewhere in this mansion, Snow was waiting. And right now, that was all that mattered.
###Chapter 54:She Killed Snow!

**Blake's POV**

The warmth of Audrey's hand still lingered on my skin. Her touch felt achingly familiar, stirring memories I'd tried to suppress.


But before I could think about it more, Laurel gasped dramatically. "Miss Sinclair is so rough. That really hurt..."


I felt the last traces of Audrey's warmth fade from my palm as I frowned at this unexpected scene. "Why are you here?" I kept my voice low.

Laurel's lower lip trembled as her eyes filled with tears. "I had a fight with my mother," she whispered, voice catching. "I couldn't stay at home."

Her fingers twisted in the fabric as she continued, "Thalia told me the mansion's been empty since Miss Sinclair moved out... so I moved in yesterday." She glanced up through wet lashes. "Blake darling, you're not mad,are you?"


I pressed my fingers to my temples, fighting back a headache. "Why didn't you tell me you needed a place to stay? I could have arranged somewhere else." A pause, heavy with implication. "I've been staying here lately."

That was hard to admit. I hadn't told anyone about my recent habit of returning to this place night after night, seeking... what? Traces of a life I'd systematically destroyed? The ghost of happiness I'd never appreciated until it was gone?

"What's the problem?" Laurel's smile was still sweet, yet it had started to grate on my nerves. "The mansion's more than big enough for both of us."

"No." I inastinctively refused. After a moment, I added with careful
neutrality, "But stay if you want. I'll make other arrangements."

Actually, her unannounced arrival effectively forced me to find somewhere else to stay, and it stirred an unexpected resistance. Among all my properties, this was the only one that still held echoes of a life I'd chosen to walk away from. The thought of abandoning it now felt like surrendering something I wasn't ready to name.


I shook my head and walked towards the living room. For a moment, the transformation inside instantly made me pause.

Every trace of Audrey had been systematically erased, replaced by Laurel's particular brand of feminine excess. Pink throw pillows littered the couch where Audrey's carefully chosen earth tones had once created an atmosphere of warmth. Crystal figurines sparkled where her modest pottery collection had made the space feel like home.

"You did all this overnight?" I surveyed the room, feeling something shattering in my heart.


"Thalia helped me decorate!" Laurel's smile was bright enough to blind. "Isn't it lovely?" She floated closer, her movement deliberately graceful.

She watched Audrey's figure upstairs then added, "Though I haven't seen Miss Sinclair's cat. Didn't she take it when she moved out? Why is she back looking for it?" Her voice carried a particular lilt. "Is she really looking for the cat, or is it just an excuse to see you?"

I studied her face, and asked, "Snow wasn't here when you moved in?"

"Yeah, the cat was... supposed to be here?"

The confusion in her expression made me realize something was wrong.Without bothering to respond, I took the stairs at a time, following Audrey'
s path.

"Blake darling!" Laurel's voice chased after me. "You must be hungry. I've got meat cooking downstairs..."

**Audrey's POV**

"Snow?" My voice echoed off walls that no longer felt familiar. "Snow,where are you?"


Every step through the Lunar Mansion felt like navigating a maze of distorted memories, where familiar corridors led to unrecognizable spaces.Three years of careful decorating choices had been erased overnight,replaced by something that felt deliberately designed to mock everything I'd built here.


Even Blake's study hadn't been spared from Laurel's invasion. The irony wasn't lost on me. During our marriage, I'd barely been allowed to enter his study, let alone change anything. Yet here was Laurel, freely redecorating the very space I'd been barred from touching. The message couldn't have been clearer- I'd always been the outsider in his life. Laurel,it seemed,was anything but.


I drew in a deep breath, forcing down the bitter realization. *Focus on Snow,* I commanded myself. *This isn't your home anymore. Whatever Blake allows Laurel to do with the space... it's none of your business.*

But determination alone wasn't enough. After what félt like hours of searching,having turned nearly every room upside down, Snow remained frustratingly absent. Not a single trace of her could be found - no fur, no favorite hiding spots, nothing. It was as if she'd vanished into thin air.

"Are you sure Snow is really here?" I finally asked, turning to Blake
behind me. "Then where is she?"

"I have no reason to lie." His voice was calm. "Michael took her to the vet for grooming. then brought her back here."

"If Snow is here, then where?" Panic began to rise. Blake's unwavering certainty only made the knot in my chest tighten. After a sleepless night of searching,after finally discovering he had taken her, how could she just...vanish?


"Watch your attitude." Laurel's voice sounded as she appeared at the top of the stairs. "Weren't you supposed to care so much about that cat? How could you lose her in the first place?" She leaned against the railing with practiced casualness. "I've been here since last night, and I haven't seen any cat!"

"Laurel, stop!" Blake's sharp tone carried a warning.

She straightened, brushing imaginary dust from her pressed outfit,moving toward the stairs. "Alright, keep looking. I need to check on my pot roast.I've got meat cooking downstairs."

The mention of cooking meat planted a seed of horror in my mind that bloomed into full-blown terror. "The meat in your pot." I rushed to her,my voice shaking. "What exactly are you cooking?"

For a split second, genuine surprise flickered across Laurel's face,then replaced by a hint of malice. "Why don't you guess?"

Before I could realize it, my hands found her throat with a strength I didn'
t know I possessed. "Is it Snow?" I demanded desperately. My vision blurred with tears but my grip remained steady. "TELL ME!"

For all her calculated provocations, my explosive rage seemed to genuinely
terrify Laurel. She managed between gasps. "Blake darling..."

I felt Blake's grip on my wrist before I registered his movement. "Enough!"



"She killed Snow!"


His voice held a hint of resignation. "Think rationally! She's a delicate actress who can barely handle a knife. How could she hurt Snow?"


The logic in his words penetrated the red haze of my panic. He was right-someone like Laurel, who needed assistance just to carry her shopping bags, who complained about breaking a nail... she'd never actually handle raw meat, let alone...

"I..." Shame flooded my cheeks, and my grip loosened as clarity returned."I'm sor..."


The words never finished forming. In that moment of vulnerability, I caught the flash of malice in Laurel's eyes. Then her hands connected with my chest, shoving with surprising strength.


Time seemed to slow as I felt myself falling backward. I saw Blake reach out for me as my body tumbled down the stairs, but it was too late. With a dull thud, I hit the first floor.

"AUDREY!"
###Chapter 55: I Want to Hear It From Miss Si ncl air Herself

**Blake's POV**

Audrey tumbled down the stairs before I could react. Her slight frame hit each step with sickening thuds that echoed through the marble halls,finally coming to rest in a crumpled heap at the bottom.

In that split second, it felt as if I didn't know how to breathe. Without conscious thought, my body was already moving toward her, driven by an instinct I couldn't understand.


But just as I had descended two steps, a voice came fromn behind me.

"Blake darling..." Laurel slumped to the ground, clutching her neck, her voice filled with misery. "It hurts... I can't breathe..."

I froze mid-stride, torn between the woman lying at the bottom of the stairs andthe one currently on the ground, one hand pressed dramatically to her neck. The sound of Laurel's labored breathing filled the silence.

"I can't breathe... Blake... please..."

*Her cancer.* As I thought this, my eyes drifted to where Audrey lay. She was already pushing herself up, using the banister for support.

The weight of my promise from five years ago pressed down on me like a physical thing.

I let out a sign, turned back, catching her just as her knees buckled."Laurel? Are you alright?"

Her skin felt cold and clammy as I lifted her into my arms. She curled into
me immediately, her body trembling. "It hurts... everything hurts..."

I didn't respond but stared at Audrey downstairs. The sight of her managing on her own helped ease the knot of guilt inmy chest.*She was fine. She had to be.*


**Audrey's POV**

The world tilted and spun as I struggled to push myself up from the floor.Each movement sent waves of agony through my body.


Compared to the physical pain, the grief welling up in my heart at this moment swept over me like a tidal wave. Here I was, having just tumbled down an entire flight of stairs, while Laurel played the victim in Blake's arms.


I gripped the banister tighter, forcing my trembling legs to hold my weight.
A small, bitter laugh escaped my lips before I could stop it.

"Blake darling..." Laurel's voice drifted down. "Don't worry about me...check on Miss Sinclaír... she looks hurt..."

"She's fine, don't worry about her."

*Fine?* The fall could have easily broken every bone in my body - the fact that I was even conscious was nothing short of miraculous. The height of those stairs... I should consider myself lucky to be alive at all.

"I didn't mean to push her..." Her voice cracked, the picture of regret. "She was choking me... I couldn't breathe... I just reacted..."

The lies rolled off her tongue so easily. I watched as Blake pulled her closer,his protective instincts fully engaged by her masterful performance.
"I know," he murmured. "It wasn't your fault."

"Blake darling..." Laurel's voice quavered. "I need to hear it from Miss Sinclair herself... I need to know she forgives me..."

I stared up at them, disbelief warring with fury in my chest. After pushing me down a flight of stairs, she had the audacity to demand forgiveness?


"Audrey." Blake's voice carried that familiar edge of command. "Come up here and tell Laurel you don't blame her."


"Don't blame her? Blake, are you out of your mind?" I forced mnyself to stand straighter, ignoring the protest from every bruised muscle. Across the distance of the staircase, I met their eyes - Blake's cold stare and Laurel's deliberate distress.


"She pushed me down these stairs. If I hadn't been lucky, I'd be dead right now." My voice came out steady. "She hasn't shown an ounce of remorse, and now you want me to tell her it's all forgiven?"

Laurel pressed a trembling hand to her chest. "I knew it...she hates me...Blake darling... I can't breathe..."


Blake's eyes darted to Laurel's increasingly pallid face. Within seconds, his phone was at his ear. "Michael, bring the car around. Now."

He pulled Laurel closer. "She's unwell, and you attacked her first. She just defended herself. That makes you even. Would it kill you to say a few words?"


Something inside me cracked at his words. Last night's intimacy,that brief flicker of hope I'd foolishly allowed myself to feel - it all turned to ash in my mouth. A laugh escaped me, brittle as frozen glass.
"You know exactly why I grabbed her." I said calmly. "She saw me desperate to find Snow, then deliberately said those words."

"Yes, I snapped." My voice hardened. "But it was barely a touch, and you know it."

My eyes locked with his. "Look at her neck. Show me these terrible marks I supposedly left."

The change was subtle but unmistakable. Laurel's hand flew to her thróat.But Blake had already seen. His grip gentled as he moved her hand away,eyes narrowing as they traced the flawless skin of her neck.

Something shifted in his expression as realization dawned.

"Now you see, I didn't actually hurt her," I continued, my voice steady despite the pain. "But she made sure I hit every step on the way down.You want me to forgive her? Dream on!"

With that, I walked towards to the door. There was no point staying here to watch their romantic performance - not when Snow was clearly gone.

The sudden creak of the front door froze me mid-step, accompanied by a familiar meow.Snow?


"Mrs. Parker? What happened?" Michael stood in the doorway, a cat carrier dangling from his hand. His eyes widened as his gaze flickered between me at the bottom of the stairs and the tableau aboye.

There, in the carrier he held, was my beloved Snow - the cat I'd spent the entire day searching for.

"Snow!"
The pain in my legs forgotten, I rushed forward,practically snatching the carrier from Michael's hands. Myfingers trembled as I opened it, gathering Snow into my arms. Hler familiar warmth against my chest felt like coming home.


"Michael." Blake's voice cut through the moment as he released Laurel and stood. His eyes narrowed dangerously. "Explain yourself. Why is the cat with you?"


Michael met Blake's penetrating stare carefully. "The timing was unfortunate, sir. All grooming services were closed when you gave me the instructions. so I had to keep her at my place overnight."

"Yesterday afternoon, between meetings, I managed to get her to the groomer's. By the time I could get back, they were closing. They offered overnight care services."


His gaze·flickered upward, taking in the scene on the stairs. "About your call regarding Miss Rose, sir..."


"Not necessary anymore." Blake's voice was ice cold as he studied Laurel.Something dangerous lurked behind his neutral expression.

I could see Laurel's practiced smile turning brittle as she remained silent.

"Michael..." I bit my lip as I secured Snow's carrier, emotion making my voice rough. "Thank you."

With that, I walked towards the door. My legs shook with each step, but I forced them steady. Snow was safe. Nothing else mattered now.

"Sir?" MMichael's voice followed me. "Should I..."

"Take her home." Blake's voice carried something I couldn't identify.
###Chapter 56: Are You Really A Cancer Pati ent?

**Blake's POV**

The door closed behind Michael with a decisive click, leaving the vast expanse of room unnaturally quiet. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows,I watched my assistant's figure hurry after Audrey's retreating form,
leaving me alone with Laurel and the echoes of what had just transpired.


The clean staircase showed no sign of what just happened. But the image of Audrey's body tumbling down those stairs was burned into my mind.

"Blake darling..." Laurel's voice wavered as she nervously wet her lips.


I remained fixed on the spot where Audrey had fallen. "That was deliberate. She barely touched you, yet you did push her."

I turned to face her fully, studying her reaction with a cold expression.The expression on her face was beginning to crack under my scrutiny.

"I couldn't breathe that moment..." Her hand fluttered to her chest. "You know about my cancer..."


"Since when does gastric cancer cause breathing problems?" The question landed like ice between us. When she didn't immediately respond, I pressed on. "I still haven't seen your medical records from Europe."

Her eyes widened slightly."I've arranged consultations with every leading gastric cancer specialist in the country. Pulled strings, called in favors,moved heaven and earth to get you the best care possible."

I narrowed my eyes. "Yet somehow, your medical records remain
mysteriously absent."

I took a step closer, watching her shrink back. "Tell me, Laurel.Are you really a cancer patient?"

She looked panicked for a moment. Her composure cracked, just for a moment, before she ducked her head to hide behind her hair.


She twisted her hands in her lap, a gesture meant to convey distress but now seemingly theatrical. "The records from Europe... they'll be here any day now..."

**Audrey's POV**


The familiar confines of my modest apartment felt like a sanctuary after the morning's drama. Snow's warm weight against my chest as I carried her inside did more to ease my pain than any painkiller could.Setting her carrier down gently, I collapsed onto my worn couch, finally allowing myself to examine the damage from my fall.


Pulling up my pant leg revealed an impressive array of bruises blooming across my skin, each step of that staircase having left its mark. The irony wasn't lost on me - I'd survived terminal cancer diagnosis only to be nearly killed by a jealous actress on a staircase.

As I rummaged through my first aid supplies, my phone buzzed with Dr.Evans' name lighting up the screen.

"Audrey," her voice carried an unusual tension. "The lady interested in your experimental treatment... her representative lawyer wants to meet now, to discuss a potentially lucrative collaboration."

I glanced down at my battered legs, wincing as I shifted position."Is it urgent?"
"The lawyer indicated it was. I know the timing is terrible, but..."

"Have them contact me then." I sighed, already knowing I'd regret this.But with only three months left to live, what did timing matter anymore?

Snow padded over, rubbing against my leg with concerned chirps. Even she seemed to sense something was off about this whole situation. As I stroked her soft fur, mmy phone buzzed again - this time an unknown number.


The lawyer was efficient, clinical, refusing to provide any details over the phone beyond time and location. As I applied antseptic to my bruises,I couldn't help but wonder what kind of collaboration could be so urgent yet so secretive.

*What could two terminal cancer patients possibly collaborate on?*I thought darkly. *Planning adjacent burial plots?*

The private dining room at the restaurant the lawyer booked carried a particular brand of luxury. Andrew Jensen, the lawyer who'd called earlier,carried himself with the precise professionalism I'd expect from someone who handled delicate matters for the ultra-wealthy.


"My client hopes you'll share your medical condition and records with her."He laid out documents with practiced efficiency. "She needs a gastric cancer patient's records to mask her true health status."

I stared at him, trying to process this bizarre request. "Wait, what? Isn't she a cancer patient herself?"

"Actually, I'm not privy to those details." His response was too smooth, too practiced. "Perhaps she needs to conceal her true health status from certain parties. Given her public profile, many eyes are on her. This choice seems
necessary."

The proposal laid before me was elegant in its deception. Each clause had been crafted carefully, leaving no loose ends that might unravel their facade.Whoever this mystery client was, they'd orchestrated quite the performance.

"Clever," I murmured, more to myself than Jensen. A terminal patient's medical records as a smokescreen - it was almost poetic in its simplicity.What better way to hide the truth than behind someone else's genuine suffering?


"The arrangement is straightforward." Jensen's voice carried that particular blend of efficiency and authority that only came from years of handling delicate matters for the wealthy. "Once you sign, the hospital will treat your records as hers. All treatments wvill be fully covered, of course."

"Most importantly, we need you to keep this quiet. Don't ask who she is or tell anyone about our deal." A practiced pause. "In return, you'll receive a monthly stipend. Consider it... compensation for your cooperation."

He leaned back. "If the terms are acceptable..."


I held up my hand, cutting off him. "Before we proceed, I have one condition of my own."

"Go head."

"I want equality in this arrangement." I met his gaze steadily. "If she keeps her identity secret, then I want the same protection. Mayo Clinic must keep my identity confidential from her as well."

After a measured silence, he withdrew his phone from his immaculate suit jacket. "I'll need to consult with my client."
While Jensen stepped out, I absently scrolled through New York's entertainment news. The comments section under Laurel's latest publicity photos drew my attention like a wound I couldn't help but probe.

*"When is Mr. Parker going to make Ms. Rose a Parker?"*

*"After three years together, Blake and Laurel should tie the knot!"*

*"Heard Blake Parker's planning to propose soon, can't wait!"*


A few months ago, these comments would have felt like daggers to my heart. Now, I just let out a smirk as I liked each one. Let them have their fairytale-I had my own mysteries to solve.

When Jensen returned, his expression carried a particular blend of satisfaction and relief. "My client finds your terms acceptable,"

"You can sign the papers now. I'll handle the arrangements with Dr.Evans later," he added.


"To our mutual benefit," I nodded, signing my name before sliding the papers back.
###Chapter 57: Thank You for Taking Care of Me

**Audrey's POV**

Outside. New York's air carried a hint of fresh scent. I'd barely lifted my hand to hail a cab when my phone buzzed. The name on the screen sent an unexpected wave of warmth through my chest - Charles Wright- the Parker family's long-serving butler who'd always treated me well.

"Mr. Wright?" The surprise in my voice was genuine.

"Mrs. Parker." His familiar voice carried that particular blend of formality and warmth I'd grown accustomed to over the years. "Mr. William Parker received some premium Arctic shrimp and insists I call to invite you over for lunch!"


I hesitated, my free hand unconsciously tightening around my purse strap."But Blake and I..."


"You and Mr. Parker haven't finalized the divorce, have you?" Charles's tone softened slightly. "Besides, even if you do divorce, Mr. Parker has been like family to you for years. How could you refuse his lunch invitation?"


The weight of three years of family dinners, holiday celebrations, and quiet moments shared over tea pressed against my chest. Even with everything that had happened, William Parker had been more of a grandfather to me than anyone in my life.

"Alright," I managed finally."I'll come now."

The taxi was hot despite the AC as we drove through traffic. I was staring
absently at the passing buildings when my phone lit up again - James Collins.

"Audrey." His voice carried an unusual hesitation. "Did you... find your cat?"

Something in his tone made my hand tighten involuntarily around the phone. "James, tell me the truth." I tried hard to keep my voice flat."Those two times you went to my apartment that night, did you really not see Snow?"


The silence that followed spoke volumes.

"Yeah, sure, Audrey." He cleared his throat. "What's going on?"

I turned to watch the city blur past my window, feeling ice in my chest."I found Snow. She's with Blake."

His sharp intake of breath on the other end of the line told me everything I needed to know. James's voice wavered slightly. "Did he say something to you?"

"Snow is all I have left." My voice came out quiet but razor-sharp. "What made you think you had the right to give her away? To tell Blake I didn't want her anymore?"

"Audrey," he said, his voice heavy with what sounded like regret, "I can explain."

"That night was urgent," he began, words tumbling out in a rush. "I had to get your medication logs to the hospital, and Blake was refusing to leave your doorstep... Snow ran out to Blake, and he took her. He kept using the cat as leverage, saying he needed to see you..."
"So you just handed my beloved pet over to him?" I cut him off.

"James," I continued, forcing my voice steady. "I appreciate your help that night at the hospital. But do you realize what could have happened if Blake hadn't been decent enough to take Snow home? She could have been captured, hit by a car, become a starving stray."

"Audrey, you have to understand," James let out a sigh. "Your condition that night was critical. I had to make a split-second decision..."

"Then what about yesterday, James?" The words tasted like ash in my mouth. "You didn't say anything about Snow the whole day. Do you have any idea what we went through? Astrid combing the streets all day,me searching until my legs gave out."

The silence from James's end stretched so long I almost checked if the call had dropped.


I pressed my forehead against the cool glass of the taxi window, suddenly bone-tired. "James, I'll transfer double the amount you covered at Mayo Clinic in a few days. Thank you for taking care of me during this time."

I ended the call before he could respond, watching his name flash across my screen again and again as he tried to call back. Each ring felt like another nail in the coffin of what I'd thought was friendship.

Outside the Parker Mansion, I immediately caught sight of that familiar black car parked by the entrance - this wouldn't be a simple lunch with William Parker.

Taking a steadying breath, I settled the fare and made my way toward the entrance, my steps slow and heavy.

But before dread could fully take hold, laughter echoed from inside.
William Parker's voice carried clearly: "Never expected you'd come visit me after so many years abroad,Felix!"

"Mr. Parker, you've always been so kind to me!" Felix's warm response floated out. "I should have visited as soon as I returned if work hadn't kept me busy!"


"You've always had such a silver tongue," William chuckled, "much better than our stoic Blake!"


As their easy banter continued, I felt some of the tension ease from my shoulders. So Felix was here too. Thank god - at least I wouldn't have to face Blake alone.


The thought gave me enough courage to stride into the living room,letting a smile touch my lips. "What's so amusing, William?"

Three heads turned at my voice. Despite our previous encounter at the racetrack. Felix maintained perfect social graces, turning to William with an artfully crafted expression of curiosity. "Mr. Parker, who is this?"

"This is my granddaughter-in-law, Blake's wife, Audrey Sinclair!" William's pride was evident even now, making something in my chest ache.

"Ah, so you're my sister-in-law. I'm Felix, Felix Thompson." Felix extended his hand with a warm smile.


"Hello, Mr. Thompson." I accepted the handshake smoothly.


"Audrey, come sit." William gestured to the empty spot beside Blake. "The chef needs a few more minutes with lunch."

I hesitated, eyeing the space beside Blake with poorly concealed reluctance.But refusing would only invite questions I couldn't answer. With no
choice left. I made my way toward the indicated seat.

As I attempted to lower myself onto the plush cushions, my injured leg betrayed me. I stumbled slightly, and before I could catch myself,familiar hands steadied me - Blake's reflexes as quick as ever.

I quickly extracted myself from his embrace, cheeks burning as I settled into mny assigned seat. "Thank you," I murmured, keeping my voice low enough that only he could hear.

"For what?" His laugh held arctic temperatures as he leaned close, his words meant for my ears alone. "Still using these tricks in public, huh?"


The words dragged me back to memories I'd rather forget. How many times had I orchestrated similar moments in our early days? Desperately seeking any excuse for contact, any moment of connection... The memory of accidentally overhearing him later - *"Such amateur acting and manipulation - how could I not see through it? I only played along to prevent her from trying something even more desperate to get close to me"*- still burned after all these years.


"Blake and Mrs. Parker seem so in love," Felix spoke up, his tone filled with mockery.


William beamed, missing entirely the implications of Felix's words. "Indeed. They had that divorce drama recently, but look at them now-all that fuss for nothing!"

"Mr. Parker," Felix's gaze flickered to me before sliding away,his smile sharp as a blade,"that's just how some couples keep things interesting."

The irony in his voice was clear. He'd been at the racetrack, had seen Blake rush to Laurel while I sat bleeding in my wrecked car.
A servant appeared with the first course just as William started to rise. But before we could settle into our seats, a familiar voice sounded:


"Blake darling!"
###Chapter 58: She's Quite Eager to Break Up Marriage

**Audrey's POV**

The sickeningly familiar voice pierced through the room, making me instinctively frown. I didn't need to look up to know what would follow - I'd seen this performance too many times before.


"Blake darling!" The words carried that particular note of breathless desperation I'd grown to hate.


Laurel burst through the doorway like she owned it, a vision in pristine white. She made straight for Blake with the kind of desperate urgency that belonged in daytime soap operas. In one fluid motion, she'd wrapped herself around him, her arms finding their practiced position at his waist.

"I've been looking everywhere foryou!" She pressed her face against his chest


The room fell completely silent as her dramatic entrance shocked everyone.

Felix's eyebrow rose sharply as he glanced my way, silently questioning. I could only offer a helpless shrug in response. What else could I do? This was hardly the first time Laurel had orchestrated such a performance,and I doubted it would be the last.

William Parker's reaction was immediate and thunderous. His walking stick struck the marble floor with enough force to make the crystal decanters rattle. "Charles!" His voice carried the kind of authority that made Wall Street titans tremble. "What is the meaning of this?"

The veins in his neck stood out as he continued, "Is our mansion's
security just for show? Since when did we start letting anyone waltz in uninvited?"

Laurel immediately withdrew from Blake's embrace, her face draining of color as she bit her lip. "Mr. Parker... I didn't mean to... I was desperate to find Blake..."


"Laurel..." Blake's voice dripped honey and silk as he turned to her,handkerchief already in hand. "Coming here without permission wasn't...appropriate." The words might have been a reprimand, but his tone carried a hint of reassurance.


A familiar ache bloomed in my chest as I watched him shift-smooth,practiced, protective - positioning himself like a shield between her and his grandfather's wrath. Five years ago, when he'd been truly blind,I'd been his eyes, his anchor, his everything. Now with perfect vision restored,he saw only what he choseto see. It was painfully ironic.

Felix's brow furrowed as he shot me another questioning look. I could only shake my head slightly in response, silently conveying my own bewilderment at the scene unfolding before us. This script was as familiar as it was painful - Laurel's performance, Blake's protection, the rest of us relegated to unwilling audience members.

William Parker's patience, already wearing thin from Laurel's tears,snapped completely at Blake's obvious display of protection. His walking stick struck the floor with thunderous force.

"Charles!" The old man's voice trembled with barely contained fury. "Get me those security、guards! NOW! I want to know exactly who let this woman into my house!"

Charles Wright burst into the room, his usually impeccable composure
notably ruffled as he wiped sweat from his brow. "Sir, the security team did try to stop Miss Rose, but she..." He paused, stealing a nervous glance at Laurel before continuing, "She threatened them using her future status as Mrs. Parker... asked if they wanted to keep their jobs."

The butler drew in a shaky breath. "The guards had seen Mr. Parker escorting her out recently, so they believed her claims..."

"Sir, the guard in question is a new hire, barely a month into the job. He wasn't fully briefed on... the situation. Perhaps if you could..."


"So Miss Rose used her 'future Mrs. Parker' status to get in." Felix pushed away from the mahogany bookshelf he'd been leaning against, his casual stance belying the sharpness in his voice. His gaze flickered to me before settling on William. "But didn't you just introduce Audrey as Blake's wife,Mr. Parker? The actual Mrs. Parker?"

When no one immediately responded, he pressed on. "You two haven't finalized the divorce yet, have you? No papers signed?"

"No,not yet."


"And Miss Rose is already claiming the title of Mrs. Parker?" Felix ĝave a cold smile. "Looks like she's quite eager to break up a marriage, huh?"

Laurel's calm and collected appearance faltered a bit. "I never said that!"She grabbed Blake's sleeve, her other hand flying to her chest in distress. "I just told security I urgently needed to see Blake... they must have assumed..."


Tears welled in her eyes as she gazed up at Blake. "Blake darling,you know I wouldn't say that."

"You're all making too much of a security guard's casual words!" Blake
spoke up. His eyes narrowed as they swept over Felix and me before returning to Laurel's tear-stained face.

Watching this familiar dance unfold, I couldn't help but marvel at the irony. Since deciding to end this marriage, I'd tried so hard to avoid direct confrontation with Blake and Laurel. I wanted no part in their relationship drama. Yet here we were, with Laurel's perfect tears and Blake's protective stance, playing out another scene in their endless performance.

"Bring the guard here, Charles. Let him confront with Miss Rose." His lips curved into a smile without warmth. "I find myself wondering whose version of truth we'll hear - my security staff, trained and vetted at considerable expense, or... our dear Miss Rose."

The calculated insult hit its mark. Through the tears still clinging to her lashes, I caught a flash of pure venom in Laurel's eyes as she stared at the old man. The look was gone in an instant, replaced by her usual vulnerability, but I'd seen it.


Actually, I could understand why she did this. With our divorce proceedings still hanging-in the air and Blake's obvious devotion to her,why wouldn't she stake her claim as the future Mrs. Parker? Her only miscalculation was William Parker himself, who never approved of her.and now he seemed determined to expose every constructed lie.

The heavy doors swung open as Charles returned, the young security guard trailing behind him, his head bowed like a scolded child as he stood before William Parker. "Sir, I was wrong to believe Miss Rose and let her in.I apologize."

"Tell us exactly what happened." William's voice could have frozen Hell itself."Did she claim to be the future Mrs. Parker and threaten you?"
"Yes, Miss Rose explicitly stated she would be the future Mrs. Parker..."

"That's a lie!" Laurel's outburst was timed, her hand clutching her chest as she struggled for breath. "Blake isn't even divorced yet,how could I say such things? I only said I needed to see Blake urgently..."

From where I sat, I had a perfect view of her crystal tears and Blake's concerned expression. Her acting skills were remarkable - tears on command, perfect emotional delivery. She could win Oscars if she put this much effort into her actual career.

"I don't know who put you up to this..." Laurel continued, "With no cameras or video, it's your word against mine..."


A ghost of a smile touched William Parker's lips. "Who said there were no cameras or video?"


He turned to his butler with calm authority. "Charles, get the security footage."
###Chapter 59: Just Because Blake Protected Her?

**Audrey's POV**

I watched as panic flickered across Laurel's face, her hand frozen mid-motion as she dabbed at fake tears.


"Mr. Parker, you have..." Her voice wavered heavily, genuine uncertainty replacing her usual calculated performance. "You have security cameras at the entrance too?"


Charles's lips curved into the faintest smile as he adjusted his impeccable butler's uniform. "During recent maintenance, Mr. Parker decided to replace all the dummy cameras with real ones." His tone carried that particular blend of courtesy and satisfaction that only decades of service could perfect. "Now the mansion's entrance has high-definition surveillance.



He paused, letting the implications sink in. "Your conversation with security should all be recorded."


I almost laughed out loud. William Parker had always been vocal about his dislike of being monitored, which was why the mansion traditionally only had real cameras in key positions. The rest were purely decorative,meant to deter would-be intruders without actually invading the family's privacy. The timing of this change felt almost too perfect.

Watching Laurel's reaction was like witnessing a masterclass in real-time character transformation. The tears suddenly dried up, panic flashing in her eyes before she could mask it. Her perfect complexion, usually glowing with practiced radiance, turned ashen.
"Miss Rose." Charles continued, "If the guard truly wronged you, we'll terminate his employment immediately."

Felix chimed in. "And if Miss Rose is the one lying?"

I couldn't help but add my own barb, letting a pointed smile play across my lips. "Surely a Hollywood actress of Miss Rose's caliber wouldn't stoop to lying about a security guard?"

The moment the words left my mouth, Laurel's entire demeanor shifted.Her shoulders slumped as she turned to Blake, her voice suddenly weak and trembling. "Blake darling, I'm not feeling well. Could you take me to the hospital?"

Blake's response was immediate, concern flooding his features. "Is it hurting again?"

She nodded tearfully, pressing one delicate hand to her chest. "Yes!"

"Alright, I'll take you to the hospital." Blake moved to support her, but William Parker's cold laugh stopped him short.

"Not yet." The old man's voice carried a kind of authority. "The footage will be here soon. The hospital can wait."

Laurel bit her lip, seeming to gather her resolve before looking up at William. "William, there's no need to check the footage."

She paused, letting a tremor enter her voice. "I know that after what happened three years ago, nothing I say or do will change your opinion of me. Even if I'm innocent, you've already decided I'm guilty. The footage won't change that,I-"

"Got it!" Charles's triumphant exclamation cut through her performance
like a knife through silk as his fingers had already pressed the laptop's playback button.

The room fell silent as the security footage began to play-

*"How dare you stop me? Do you know who I am? I'm Laurel Rose, Blake Parker's future wife!"*

*"I'm going to be Mrs. Parker. Can you afford to offend me?"*


*"If you don't let me in now, once I become Mrs. Parker and take over this house, you'll be the first one fired!"*


The contrast between the imperious woman in the footage and the delicate flower currently wilting in Blake's arms was chilling.I watched as mortification painted her face a deep purple, the color spreading down her neck in blotchy patches that no amount of expensive foundation could hide.


Blake's hand, which had been resting protectively on her shoulder, slowly withdrew. The silence that followed felt heavy enough to crack the mansion's marble floors.


William Parker's cold laugh shattered the silence. "Is this what you meant by the guard wronging you?"

"For someone who was just having trouble breathing and stomach pains,"Felix observed with deadly precision, "Miss Rose seems quite energetic in that footage." His gaze flickered to me before adding, "She sounds healthier than you in the video."


Charles turned to the guard who'd been standing quietly in the corner,dignity intact despite the accusations that had been hurled at him. "You can return to work. No termination needed."
Watching the honest guard's retreating figure, I couldn't help but frown.This morning's scene at Lunar Mansion flashed through my mind-Laurel pushing me down the stairs, yet Blake demanding I forgive her.These injustices seemed to be a recurring theme, each one more bitter than the last.

Something sparked inside me, a flame of resistance I thought had been extinguished long ago. Before I could second-guess myself, I called out,"Wait."


The guard paused, turning back with uncertainty written across his weathered features.


I fixed Laurel with a cold stare. "If Mr. Parker hadn't installed those cameras, this guard would have lost his job because of your lie." Each word felt like ice on my tongue. "Don't you owe him an apology?"

Why did Laurel never have to apologize for hurting others? Just because Blake protected her?

A deafening silence fell over the living room. Laurel stood rooted to the spot, her manicured fingers twisting in the delicate fabric of her blouse. "I know I was wrong about this..." Her voice trailed off into uncertainty.

"Please." Felix's laugh carried Arctic temperatures. "Let's not pretend Miss Rose would ever genuinely apologize to someone she considers beneath her." His eyes glittered with undisguised contempt. "Wouldn't want to tarnish that carefully crafted image,would we?"

"Exactly!" William Parker's voice cracked like a whip. "Just like three years ago - quick to act, but never to accept responsibility." His weathered features hardened with disgust. "Some things never change."
Each word seemed to chip away at Laurel's porcelain composure.She put her hand on Blake's arm, her face a masterpiece of calculated distress."Blake darling..."

Her voice quivered as tears spilled down her cheeks. "Remember those medical records you asked for? From Europe? I had them rushed here the moment they arrived..."


"Do you know how hard it was to expedite international medical records?"A delicate sob punctuated her words. "I came straight here to tell you, but at the gate..." Her voice cracked artfully. "I just... I lost myself for a moment..."


"I know what I did was wrong. The lie... I only wanted to save face..."

Before anyone could react, she wvrenched away from Blake and rushed toward the guard.


In one fluid motion that would have made her acting coach proud, she sank to her knees, her white designer dress billowing around her like a tragic heroine's costume.
###Chapter 60: Why Do You Look So Pale?

**Audrey's POV**

Honestly, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. One moment Laurel Rose had been standing there, cornered by irrefutable video evidence of her lies.The next, she'd dropped to her knees with the kind of dramatic flairthat would have made Broadway directors weep with envy.


"I'm sorry!" The words burst from her like a perfectly rehearsed soliloquy.

"I apologize for my arrogant behavior at the gate," she continued, words filled with calibrated remorse. "And for falsely accusing you of lying,nearly costing you your job!" Her voice cracked at exactly the right moment,tears gathering in her eyes with professional timing.


The security guard shifted uncomfortably, clearly as taken aback by this performance as the rest of us. Laurel seized the moment, pressing on with increasing fervor.


"I've always been known for my gentle nature. This is the first time I've ever acted this way, and look how quickly karma struck..." She pressed one hand to her chest, the picture of sincere contrition. "I sincerely apologize, and to show my remorse, my assistant will contact you with a ten thousand check. Buy yourself something nice... consider it compensation for my behavior."

Her body seemed to wilt like a delicate flower as she delivered her final line: "Once again, I am truly sorry!"

I watched the scene unfold with a mix of grudging admiration and bone-deep exhaustion. Three years of marriage to Blake Parker had taught me to recognize manipulation when I saw it, but even I had to admit-Laurel
was in a class of her own.

But the real performance was yet to come. As if on cue, Laurel's strength seemed to fail her. She slumped forward, one hand clutching her chest while the other reached weakly for Blake.

"Laurel!" Blake's voice carried genuine alarm. Together with the guard,Blake helped Laurel to her feet. She swayed dramatically, clutching his arm as if it were the only thing keeping her upright.

Blake cradled her head against his shoulder, his protective instincts fully engaged. "Charles! Call an ambulance!"

I caught the butler's instinctive glance toward William Parker, seeking approval before acting on Blake's order. The old man's dismissive wave spoke volumes about his thoughts on this latest melodrama.


As Charles stepped away to make the call, Laurel turned her face into Blake's chest, her voice dropping to a theatrical whisper. "Blake darling..."

Blake leaned down, his ear close to her lips as she whispered something I couldn't catch. Whatever she said made his expression soften instantly, his protective instincts clearly engaged by her performance. I caught fragments of words that sounded like "records" and "Europe," but the rest was lost in their private exchange.


Something cold settled in my stomach that had nothing to do with my actual cancer as I watched their intimate moment. The way she clung to him, the way he bent so attentively to catch her every word - it was a reminder of everything I'd lost, everything I'd never truly had.

Laurel's gaze suddenly snapped to me, a flash of something darker beneath her tears. "Miss Sinclair, I gave you the apology you wanted..."
Her voice carried just the right note of wounded innocence. "What more do you want from me?"

I was confused. "What do you mean, what more do I want?" I could feel my brows drawing together, hands clenching at my sides. "When you wrong someone, you apologize. Isn't that basic decency?"

"She's already ill," Blake's voice was cold. "Why must you keep targeting her?"


"Targeting her?" These words were so cruel. "You call this targeting? I just want her to take responsibility for what she's done and apologize for her mistakes..."


"Enough!" His eyes burned with fury. "Isn't this just because you're bitter about her accidentally pushing you this morning? Using this security guard incident to get your revenge?"

I opened my mouth to explain, to defend myself, but he cut me off with brutal efficiency.


"Audrey, I used to think your grace under pressure was genuine.I thought that was your true nature." His lip curled in disgust. "Now I see it was all an act! You're actually this petty!"

The words lodged in my chest like shards of ice. How perfectly Laurel had orchestrated this-turning my attempt at justice for the guard into proof of my own vindictiveness.

The sound of an ambulance siren filtered in from outside, its wail growing steadily closer.

"Blake darling," Laurel's voice quavered perfectly. "I feel so faint...Can you take me to the ambulance for oxygen?"
As they passed me, it happened so quickly I almost thought I'd imagined it. Laurel's stiletto connected with my stomach in a vicious kick, the impact sending me stumbling backward. If Felix hadn't caught me, I would have hit the floor.

"Oh... it hurts..." Laurel's performance never faltered as she clung to Blake,her face a mask of delicate suffering even as triumph flickered in her eyes.


Blake's brow furrowed. His steps growing more urgent as he carried her out, holding her even closer than before, never casting a glance towards me.

The pain bloomed sharp and immediate where she'd kicked me, but I forced myself to remain silent. What was the point of speaking up? Blake would never believe me over his precious Laurel.


"Are you alright?" Felix's concerned voice came from beside me as he helped me to the sofa. His hand moved as if to check the injury, then withdrew awkwardly.


William Parker's weathered face creased with fury. "Charles, call Dr.Bennett to check Audrey's injury."

I widened my eyes. "It's fine, William, just a bump, I..."

His eyes blazed as he continued, "I saw her kick you clearly! That woman did it deliberately! She was wearing pointed stilettos - how could a kick to your stomach not hurt?"


He shot Charles a cold glare. "Quick!"

The butler bowed, slightly and hurried from the room, his footsteps echoing against the marble floors. Within minutes, those same footsteps returned,accompanied by the measured click of heels.
Dr. Ava Bennett appeared in the doorway, wereing a pristine white coat.Her eyes swept the room with professional efficiency before landing on William. "Mr. Parker?"

"A bastard," William pointed at me, "kicked Audrey in the stomach.Examine her. Now."


I watched Dr. Bennett's expression shift subtly. Though we'd only interacted occasionally during her two years as the Parker family physician,she treated me quite well.

She turned to me, brows furrowing. "Can you make it to the guest room?"

Pride made me nod, made me push myself to my feet despite knowing better. The movement pulled at my bruised muscles, sending sparks of pain shooting through my legs. The world tilted dangerously, my knees threatening to buckle.

"Careful!" Dr. Bennett caught my elbow while shooting Felix a pointed look. "Mr. Thompson, give me a hand."

Felix moved instantly to my other side, his support careful and professional. Together, they guided me toward the nearest guest room,each step a careful dance of pain and pretense.

Once inside, Dr. Bennett shut the door with deliberate care. The soft click of the latch seemed to transform her from the Parkers' polite family doctor into something more direct. Her eyes found mine, sharp with concern as she took in my appearance.

"It's just been months, why do you look so pale."
###Chapter 61: I Don't Want to Die As Mrs.Parker

**Audrey's POV**

Dr. Bennett pulled out her medical equipment. The familiar scent of antiseptic filled the air- a scent that had become all too familiar these past few months. Her movements were precise, professional, but I could see the concern in her eyes as she glanced up at me.

"I remember asking you to get your stomach checked at the hospital months ago," she said, "Did you go? What were the results?"


The memory of that dinner with William months ago flashed through my mind - the moment I'd coughed blood into my napkin, trying to hide it,and Dr. Bennett's sharp eyes catching everything. Her insistence that I get checked had led to the diagnosis that shattered my world.

I forced a calm smile now, the lie sliding from my lips. "I got checked.Nothing serious,just gastritis."

Dr. Bennett's eyes narrowed slightly. "Are you sure that's all?"

She reached for my wrist, clearly intending to have a check. I jerked back instinctively, perhaps too quickly.

Rather than argue further, I lifted the edge of my shirt,redirecting her medical curiosity to where it wouldn't uncover secrets I wasn't ready to share. "William asked you to check the injury on my stomach."

Dr. Bennett's lips pressed into a thin line, clearly not finished with her questions about my stomach issues. But the moment the fabric revealed the angry purple-black mark spreading across my abdomen, her
professional concern overwhelmed her suspicion.

Her latex-gloved hands were gentle as she examined my abdomen, but even the lightest touch sent waves of pain through my body.

"This is severe!" Dr. Bennett leaned in closer, her professional demeanor cracking slightly. "Does this hurt?"

I managed a silent nod, biting my lip against the pain.


She sighed, her breath carrying a weight of frustration. The examination continued in tense silence until she finally straightened. "Fortunately it's just external bruising. But it'll be painful for a while."


Just as I thought we were finished, she knelt to examine my legs. Her sharp intake of breath told me everything I needed to know about how the bruises must look.


"What happened here?" Her voice carried a mix of horror and anger. "Was this from being kicked too?"


"I was pushed down the stairs this morning." The words came out weary,resigned.


"By the same person who kicked you?" Her eyes widened as understanding dawned.


Images of this morning's incident flashed through my mind -the malice in Laurel's eyes, the sudden shove, the sickening sensation of falling.I nodded silently.


"My god," Dr. Bennett observed, her clinical assessment carrying an undercurrent of disgust, "This isn't accidental. These are calculated attacks."
With practiced efficiency, she uncapped a tube of prescription-strength ointment, her touch surprisingly gentle as she applied it to the angry bruises mapping my legs and abdomen. The relief was immediate but fleeting-like everything else in my life these'days.

When she finished, she clicked her pen and began making detailed notes on her clipboard. My eyes caught the medical terminology she was recording.

"Dr. Bennett." My hand shot out before I could reconsider, fingers closing around her wrist. Her pen stilled as she looked up, surprise evident in her expression. "About my condition..."

I shifted my gaze toward the door, lowering my voice. "Could you... not tell William? He's aged, I don't want him to worry about me."


She pushed her glasses up her nose, fixing me with a penetrating stare. "Tell me exactly what your condition is, and I'll agree."

The moment stretched between us like a thread about to snap. Finally, I let outa long breath and told her everything - the diagnosis, the prognosis,the experimental treatment that might or might not buy me a few more months.


"No wonder you insist on divorce," she said softly when I finished. "You're trying to spare Blake?"

A bitter laugh escaped before I could stop it. "No, I stopped loving him long ago."


*With less than three months to live, I don't want to die as Mrs. Parker.He doesn't love me, and I should free myself too. Even in death, I want to return to being just Audrey Sinclair.*
Dr. Bennett studied me for a long moment before crossing out some words on her clipboard. "I can keep the cancer secret,but I must report the other injuries to Mr.Parker."

I nodded, relief flooding through me. One more person to help carry this burden, one more ally in keeping my secret.

We made our way back to the living room where William Parker and Felix Thompson waited. The moment Dr. Bennett handed over her report,William's face darkened with fury.


"Multiple injuries from falling!?" His weathered hands shook as he gripped the paper. "No wonder she could barely stand! Audrey, how did this happen?"


Felix stepped forward, his usually carefree expression replaced by something harder. "I heard Blake say Miss Rose pushed her down the stairs this morning. These injuries must be from then."


"That troublemaker again! She-" William's voice cut off as the door burst open with enough force to rattle the paintings on the walls.

Blake Parker stood in the doorway, his presence filling the room like a gathering storm. Without a word, he strode toward me and grabbed my wrist.


"Come with me to the hospital, apologize to Laurel!"

"You brat, let her go!" William's voice cracked like thunder.


Blake ignored him, completely, his grip tightening painfully as he pulled me toward the door. I was already running on empty - between the cancer eating me from the inside and the morning's trip down the stairs, I had nothing left. Each step was a negotiation my body barely had the currency
to afford.

"Laurel's been emotionally unstable because of what you said." he snapped,"It's critical! Come apologize to her right now!"

"Blake Parker!" William clutched his chest, his face reddening dangerously."Release Audrey this instant!"

Every step sent fresh waves of pain through my battered body as Blake dragged me toward the entrance. The physical pain barely registered compared to the ache in my heart. *The man I once loved won't even look at me now. Perhaps I was never anything to him from the start.*

Just as we reached the entrance, Felix stepped into our path. "Audrey's legs are injured. If you keep dragging her like this, she'll collapse before you even reach the hospital!"

Blake stopped his charge toward the exit. The look Blake shot me over his shoulder was pure ice, his lips twisting into something that wasn't quite a smile.


"Playing the victim again, huh?" His words were cold as ice.

William moved with surprising speed for a man his age, his cane against marble echoing. He wedged himself between us, prying Blake's fingers from my wrist with a strength that belied his years. "Open your eyes! That woman has already left your wife covered in bruises. How dare you treat her like this?"


"Seriously?" Blake's voice dropped. "Is that the story Audrey's spinning?"

"She didn't have to." Dr. Bennett's clear voice cut through the tension.Before anyone could react, she knelt and lifted my pant leg, exposing the angry bruises that mapped my fall down the stairs.
"You say she's playing victim," she continued, her voice ice-cold as she met Blake's gaze. "Then what are these injuries? You remember what Miss Rose did to her this morning, don't you?"

I watched as Blake's eyes fixed on my injuries, tracking from one bruise to the next. The anger drained from his face like water down a sink,leaving behind something I hadn't seen there in years-uncertainty.

"All of these..." His voice had lost its edge. "From this morning?"
###Chapter 62: I Thought You Were Used To It
Blake's POV
The marks on Audrey’s skin held my gaze, an unexpected tightness forming in my chest. Faint traces of the morning’s chaos mapped her pale skin like a silent record of everything that had gone wrong.
Earlier today, when the commotion on the stairs happened, she hadn’t cried out. She hadn’t shown any sign of distress as she simply took Snow’s carrier and walked away. I had assumed she was fine—or perhaps, more accurately, I had needed her to be fine. I had seen the slight unsteadiness in her step, but acknowledging it would have meant confronting a reality I wasn't ready to face.
Dr. Bennett’s expression was dark as she finished her assessment. Her eyes found mine, sharp with unspoken accusation.
"These marks aren't just from a simple stumble, Blake," she said, her voice slicing through the room’s tension. "They're deep, localized. This requires significant force."
"It must have been an accidental collision during the confusion," I said automatically. The defense felt thin even to my own ears. I had been so focused on getting Laurel to safety—had I really missed what happened right in front of me?
Felix stepped forward, physically placing himself between Audrey and me. "Blake," he began, his voice balancing respect with a hard edge of challenge. "Whatever your history with Laurel, Audrey was the one who stood by you when you were at your lowest. Even if there’s no love left, where is the loyalty? She is still your wife."
The words stung. My grandfather’s cane struck the marble floor with a resounding crack. "Exactly! You demand Audrey apologize for a situation she didn't create, yet you ignore the state she's in. Is this the man I raised?"
The weight of their disapproval pressed in from all sides. I turned to Audrey, seeking to deflect the mounting pressure. "Why didn't you tell me you were struggling earlier?" I asked, the words sounding hollow even as I said them.
Audrey met my gaze with a bitter, knowing smile. "Would it have changed anything?" her voice was a quiet testament to years of accumulated disappointment. "This morning, you told me to just move past it. Have you already forgotten?"
The air in the room thickened. My phone suddenly rang—Laurel’s name lit up the screen. Relief washed over me as I answered, a way to escape the accusing stares.
"Blake," Laurel’s voice came through, thin and trembling. "I’m at the clinic... they say I need to stay. I feel so alone... is Audrey coming? I just want to clear the air..."
A surge of urgency took over. "I’m coming right now," I promised. I hung up and turned back, my mind set. The moral quandary from moments ago was eclipsed by the immediate need to resolve the tension at the clinic.
Ignoring the protests from Felix and my grandfather, I took Audrey’s arm, my grip firm. "Laurel’s situation is urgent. We’re going to the clinic. I’ll ensure your medical needs are fully addressed there, I promise."
"Blake Parker! Let go!" she protested, her strength surprising me.
"There's no time for this," I muttered, guiding her toward the car. I didn't want to use force, but the pressure of the day had pushed me to a point of no return. Once we were in the car and moving, the space between us felt like a void.
In the rearview mirror, I saw her staring out the window, her expression cold and defiant.
"Don't expect an apology from me," she said flatly. "Not today. Not ever."
"It's just about peace, Audrey," I gripped the steering wheel. "Why has everything become a battle with you lately? Laurel is fragile; she’s been through so much in Europe."
I remembered the medical files I’d seen—the documented struggles Laurel had faced. It seemed impossible that she could look so vibrant while carrying such a burden. I looked at Audrey again. Compared to Laurel, Audrey seemed... resilient. Unbreakable.
"Laurel has suffered tremendously these past years," I said, my voice softening. "She’s had a hard road."
Audrey's POV
A bitter laugh escaped me. I met Blake’s eyes in the mirror. "So her past hardships justify her actions today? And I’m the one who has to make amends for existing in her way?"
For a moment, uncertainty flickered across his features.
"You weren't like this before," he finally said, a hint of accusation in his tone.
Something flared inside me—a spark of long-suppressed clarity. "And what was I like before?" I challenged.
"The old Audrey understood the bigger picture," he replied, focusing on the road. "You didn't make every small friction into a crisis. You were... patient."
I leaned back against the leather seat, a mocking smile playing on my lips. "Patient. That’s an interesting word for it. It means you’ve always known, haven't you?"
He had witnessed every backhanded comment from his mother, every calculated snub from his sister. I had spent years telling myself he was just oblivious—a typical man who couldn't see the subtle warfare of the household. I had made a thousand excuses for his silence.
But the truth was far worse. He hadn't been blind. He had simply chosen not to see.
His body stiffened, his fingers tightening on the wheel. When he finally spoke, his voice was quiet, but it landed with the force of a final betrayal:
"I thought you were used to it."

###Chapter 63: Your Husband Would Do Anythi ng For Me
Audrey's POV
"Used to it."
Simple words, devastating in their casual cruelty.
I stared out at the passing city lights, a bitter laugh escaping me. Five years of loving him, three years of marriage, and this was the sum of my worth—someone who should have grown accustomed to being the family’s convenient target. The whispered mockery at charity galas, the endless speculation about my background—apparently, I should have developed immunity to the constant erosion of my dignity by now.
Each graceful deflection of a veiled insult had cost me pieces of myself I’d never get back. And for what? To hear him dismiss it all with three casual words.
"No," my voice came out steady, unfamiliar even to my own ears. "I never got used to it." I met his eyes in the rearview mirror, my gaze unyielding. "No one gets used to being a target, Blake. They just get tired of holding the shield."
Blake’s gaze flickered in the mirror, searching my face for the compliance he’d grown accustomed to. For once, he found only a cold, hard resolution.
"So this time," I let each word land with deliberate weight, "I would rather stand my ground and lose everything than offer a hollow apology to your Miss Rose."
The sharp screech of tires filled the cabin as Blake pulled the car over with sudden, jarring force. The world outside the window blurred as the car came to a dead stop.
Blake's POV
I yanked the gear shift into park, a cold anger coursing through me. I turned to face her, but the words I intended to say died in my throat.
The woman staring back at me was a stranger. The warm glow that used to light her eyes whenever she looked at me was gone, replaced by a crystalline frost. When had she become so unreadable?
A fleeting sense of unease washed over me, but I pushed it down, reaching for a cigarette. The flame of my lighter caught the sharp, beautiful angles of her face. Even in her fury, she possessed a quiet strength that felt increasingly foreign to me.
"What if I insist?" I asked, my voice calmer than I felt.
A mocking smile touched her lips. "And if I refuse? What then, Mr. Parker? Will you try to force the words from me?"
The formal address stung. We had become strangers in the very house we shared.
"That won't be necessary," I said, letting the smoke curl between us. "I believe you value your friend’s future more than your own pride. My office recently reviewed the management contracts of Astrid Wilson’s agency."
Audrey's POV
The mention of Astrid made my nerves go taut. She was the one person who had stood by me through my diagnosis and the loss of my baby.
"Our legal team found several... complications in the agency’s recent behavior," Blake continued, his voice as cold as a business transaction. "There are records of contract violations and professional disputes that, if released, would end her career in this city permanently. Her name would be blacklisted before sunset."
I remained silent, my heart hammer-pounding against my ribs. He was using the one person I had left to protect as a pawn.
Blake pulled up a series of legal documents on his phone, highlighting the clauses that could ruin her. "I don’t enjoy resorting to this, Audrey. But you’ve forced my hand. You apologize, and these files stay in my private vault. Forever. Your choice."
I searched his face for a trace of the man I once thought I knew—the man who had held my hand through the darkest nights of our early marriage. Had he always been this ruthless? Or had I simply been blind to the predator beneath the suit?
"Fine," the word tasted like ash. "I'll go."
"A wise decision," he said, the tension in his jaw relaxing.
"But after this," I added, my voice low and dangerous, "you leave Astrid out of our war. You destroy those files."
"You have my word," he said.
We arrived at the clinic minutes later. The private wing was a masterpiece of medical theater. To my practiced eye—too familiar now with the reality of genuine critical care—the artifice was obvious. The machines beeped with dramatic timing, and the nurses moved with an exaggerated urgency that didn't match the stable readings on the monitors.
Laurel lay in bed, artfully pale, an oxygen mask resting near her face.
"Miss Sinclair..." she whispered, her voice paper-thin. "You came..."
"I heard your recovery depended on it," I said flatly.
A flash of irritation crossed her face before she caught herself, clutching her chest with a delicate cough as Blake entered the room. "No, Blake... please, I don't want an apology to be forced... I just want peace..."
Blake was at her side instantly. "Laurel, don't overexert yourself." He turned to me, his voice a low warning: "Remember what’s at stake."
"I remember," I replied, my nails digging into my palms.
"Blake, darling," Laurel looked up at him with watery eyes. "Let me speak with Audrey alone. I need to clear the air without an audience."
With obvious reluctance, Blake released her hand and stepped out. As he passed me, he didn't even look my way.
The moment the door clicked shut, Laurel’s transformation was instantaneous. She sat up, the weakness vanishing like mist. Her lips curved into a triumphant, predatory smile.
"Audrey Sinclair," she said, her voice ringing with clarity as she leaned forward. "Do you see it now? Your husband would tear down the world just to keep me smiling. What do you have left?"

###Chapter 64: Get On Your Knees And Apol ogi ze

**Audrey's POV**

Mayo Clinic's private rooms were designed to soothe with their muted colors and soft lighting. But watching Laurel's theatrical performance from my chair, I felt anything but soothed. A strange calm settled over me instead- the kind that comes with having nothing left to lose.

"Still playing the devoted patient?" I crossed my legs, studying her pristine appearance. "It's been a month since your grand return from Europe.Blake still hasn't finalized our divorce." My lips curved into a smile that seemed to catch her off guard. "Performance not quite landing the way you hoped?"

Three years of playing the perfect Mrs. Parker, swallowing every insult with a dignified smile, had taught me exactly how to make each word count. With death already marking my calendar, why bother with niceties?

The change in Laurel was instant. Color flooded her previously ashen cheeks as she dropped the frâgile patient act. "You're the one who missed the divorce appointment!" She pushed herself up, healthcare performance forgotten. "Hiding in hospitals to avoid signing papers, and now you dare mock me?"


"Hiding?" I kept my voice light. "Interesting theory. Though if Blake was truly eager to divorce me, he'd have rescheduled immediately. Yet this morning..." I let the implication hang.

Laurel's perfectly manicured hands twisted in the sheets. "You won't be Mrs. Parker much longer," she hissed. "Blake will divorce you this week."
She was right, of course. I'd overheard enough to know that Blake had already reserved the venue and cake for his proposal to Laurel. He would definitely seek me out for divorce this week. So I wanted to take this opportunity, while still legally married, to give myself some satisfaction.After all, I wouldn't be around to enjoy the aftermath much longer.

"He'll give me the most lavish proposal New York has ever seen!" Her eyes raked over me with calculated disdain. "Unlike your pathetic little wedding while he was in a coma."


She leaned forward, her voice filled with malice. "That's what happens when you force a man who doesn't love you to marry you. Even carrying his child couldn't save you - you lost that too, didn't you?"

The jab about my lost child hit harder than I wanted to admit. For a moment, the hospital air felt thick with memories - blood on pristine tiles,Blake's cold disbelief, a future crumbling like sand between my fingers.


*Karma's a bitch*, I thought grimly. But with three months left to live,what was the point of playing nice?

I took a deep breath, not wanting to continue this topic.

"You know what they say about method acting?" A cold smile formed on my lips as I looked at her vibrant, healthy appearance. "Sometimes actors get so deep into their roles, it becomes reality. Keep playing sick, Miss Rose- you might just manifest something real."

She yawned dismissively. "I'm just practicing mny craft anyway."

Her eyes narrowed before she abruptly changed tactics. "By the way, didn't you come here to apologize to me?" She pointed to the floor with one slender finger. "Come on, get on your knees and apologize to me."
"That won't necessary, I think." I leaned back in my chair, amused by her demand. "Without Blake's threat. I would rather die than be here."

I looked at her, my voice devoid of emotions. "Honestly, thank you for sending him away. I was worried about how to force out an apology with him around, but now it's just us - no need for pretense."

Her painted lips tightened. "What do you mean?"

"If you don't do as I said, I'll make sure Blake releases whatever leverage he has over you."

"I'm so scared." I pulled out my phone, watching her widened eyes. "Want to hear your Oscar-worthy performance?"

The recording was crystal clear: *"Do you see? Your husband would do anything for me."*

The color drained from her face as her own voice echoed back. Gone was the delicate invalid, replaced by something altogether more dangerous.

"You recorded me?" Each-word trembled with fury. "How dare you -"

"Miss Rose," I cut her off. A cold laugh escaped me. "What do you think Blake's reaction would be if he knew you've been faking your illness all along?"


"Blake was right about you," she whispered, each word trembling with fury."You're full of schemes. How despicable!"

"Despicable?" I stopped the playback. "You crashed into me at the track.pushed me down stairs, and now this pathetic show. And you said I'm despicable?"
Laurel glared at me with narrowed eyes. "If you dare give that recording to Blake, I'llmake sure you pay even if it costs me my life!"

"I'm not interested in that." The statement was cold but true. With my own death sentence hanging over mne, threats had lost their power. "Keep your act if you want, but stay out of my way. Otherwise, this goes public."I met her gaze steadily. "Even Blake Parker's influence can't save an actress caught faking illness for attention."

The silence stretched between us like a living thing. Finally, Laurel sank back against her pillows, defeat written in every line of her body.

"Miss Rose, still need my apology now?"

"No!" she murmured,almost speaking through gritted teeth.

"Good, I make my leave now." As I reached the door, rustling sounds made me glance back. Laurel was already repositioning her oxygen mask,transforming back into the perfect patient. The performance would have been impressive if it wasn't so predictable.

In the corridor, Blake sat in a chair directly opposite the room door,frowning as he looked at documents in his hand while occasionally glancing through the small window in the door. Seeing me emerge, he immediately closed the document, set it aside, and stood.

"Well?" The concern in his voice was too obvious. "Is she alright?"

"See for yourself." My eyes dropped to his phone. "I've done what you asked. Now delete those photos of Astrid."

I wanted to see with my own eyes that Blake deleted all those photos and backups. This concerned Astrid's privacy, and I didn't want any mistakes.After everything my friend had done for me, I owed her at least this much
protection.

He frowned. "After I check on Laurel."

He brushed past me into the room, leaving the door slightly ajar. Their voices drifted out:

"Laurel! Are you feeling better?"

"Blake darling... much better now. Miss Sinclair apologized..."


The corridor air felt cool against my skin, making my head throb like it was being stabbed with needles. Hearing their voices, my head hurt even more. If it weren't for Astrid, I would have turned and left immediately.But thinking about those photos in Blake's possession...

Suppressing my impatience, I moved to sit, noticing Blake's abandoned documents. The papers slipped from my grasp, scattering across the floor.As I gathered them, certain phrases caught my eye: "advanced stage," "experimental treatment," "survival rates."


My hands froze.

These weren't business documents- they were research papers on gastric cancer! My condition!
###Chapter 65: Miss Sinclair, Do You Hate Me?

**Audrey's POV**

Looking at these papers, my heart stuttered. Blake Parker, studying gastric cancer research? For a moment, wild hope flared in my chest. Had he somehow discovered my condition? Was there still enough of the man I'd married left to care?

A tiny spark of hope flickered to life in my chest. Perhaps beneath all his cruelty and indifference, some part of him still cared. Maybe he'd discovered my condition and was secretly trying to help me. The thought made my throat tighten with unexpected emotion.

"Audrey Sinclair. What are you doing?"


I was still crouching on the floor collecting papers when Blake's cold voice cut through my thoughts. I instinctively looked up,my voice slightly trembling as I asked the question burning in my mind.

"Blake. Why... why are you researching this illness?"


His expression darkened immediately. He strode over and snatched the files from my hands, his movements precise and angry as he carefully placed the scattered papers back into the folder.

"Who gave you permission to look at these papers?" I could hear the anger and frustration in his voice.


"These cost a fortune to obtain from overseas medical schools. They need to be returned intact." He continued, coldly glaring at me.

The tiny spark of hope that had just risen in my heart instantly dissipated,leaving behind only the familiar cold emptiness. He wasn't doing this for
me. Of course he wasn't. When had Blake Parker ever done anything for me?

I watched him organize the papers with meticulous care,his attention to these documents far exceeding any attention he'd shown me in years. My mind raced, tryingto make sense of the situation. Blake wasn't a medical professional. Parker Group didn't deal with pharmaceuticals. So why...

*Wait.*

Every time Laurel feigned illness, she complained of stomach pains -Blake wasn't researching gastric cancer for me. He was worried that Laurel s stomach pains might develop into something more serious.

The realization felt like ice water in my veins.

I couldn't help but let out a bitter laugh. The memories I'd tried so hard to bury came flooding back.

Those first six months after he regained consciousness, when his eyes would light up at the sight of my homemade beef stew, when he'd insist on having dinner together no matter how late his meetings ran. The way he'd wrap his arms around me in the kitchen, stealing bites as I cooked,laughing at my protests. Back then, my cooking had been his favorite thing in the world.


But somewhere along the way, everything changed. The warmth in his eyes cooled, the shared dinners became rare, then stopped entirely. Still, I kept cooking, kept waiting with meals that grew cold on the table. Night after night, ignoring my cramping stomach, telling myself he'd come home eventually. Even William Parker noticed - "Boy, look at your wife. She's getting too thin." But by then, it was only Michael who checked on me.
The man who never even spared me a glance was studying top-level gastric cancer research papers because of Laurel's fake stomach pains. So this is what it looked like when Blake Parker truly cared for someone.

I was pulled from my bitter reflections by Laurel's voice drifting out from the hospital room.

"Blake darling," her voice was weak but carried that distinctive wheedling quality I'd come to recognize, "I heard a noise outside, what happened?"

"Nothing happened," Blake responded, his tone instantly softening to something I barely recognized. "Audrey juast knocked over a water bottle!"


"I told you earlier that leaving Miss Sinclair alone outside would be boring for her, but you wouldn't listen," Laurel continued, her voice dripping with practiced concern.

"Why don't both of you come in? The three of us can chat together,wouldn't that be nice?"


Blake turned to me, all traces of tenderness vanishing from his expression."Let's go,"he ordered.

I shook my head. "I have nothing to discuss with you two."


I looked at him directly, keeping my voice steady despite the storm of emotions inside me. "You've confirmed that your precious Miss Rose's emotions have calmed down, right? Delete those photos and their backups now,and I'Il leave immediately, not disturbing your private time with Miss Rose."


His brows furrowed deeply. "Audrey Sinclair, don't speak so unpleasantly."He lowered his voice, though I could still hear the edge of anger. "What private time? In my eyes, Laurel is like a sister!"
The corner of my lips curved upward into a mocking smile. "Oh, sister?"

*Such an act.* He had booked the venue and cake for their engagement a month before Laurel returned from Europe. Now he was telling me he only saw Laurel as a sister?

"We're completely innocent, whether you believe it ornot," Blake insisted,his tone growing increasingly irritated.

Before I could respond, the door to the hospital room opened wider, and Laurel appeared in the doorway. She was dressed in a designer hospital gown, her hair perfectly styled despite her supposed illness.

"Blake darling, Miss Sinclair..." se said softly.

Blake immediately turned to her, his expression transforming into one of concern. "Why did you get out of bed!"

"I... I saw that neither of you were coming to find me, so I came out to check..." Laurel's voice quavered delicately. She turned to me, her eyes widening with practiced innocence.

"Miss Sínclair, you've already apologized to me... we should consider our grievances resolved..." She gestured toward the room behind her. "Don't mind my small hospital room, please come in and chat with Blake darling and me,would you?"


"I have nothing to discuss with you two," I repeated firmly.

Laurel reached out and tightly grabbed my sleeve. Though she was pretending to be ill in front of Blake, the hand gripping my arm was surprisingly strong. I frowned and instinctively tried to pull her hand away, but she clung tighter. When I tugged more forcefully, she stumbled from the force,nearly falling.
Blake quickly caught her body, positioning himself protectively between us.Despite my efforts, I couldn't pull Laurel's hand away from my sleeve.

"Miss Sinclair," Laurel looked up at me, eyes red, tears streaming down her face. "do you hate me?"

I fought the urge to laugh at the absurdity of the question.Instead,I shook my head insincerely."No,I don't."


"Then why won't you join Blake darling in keeping me company?" Her lower lip trembled perfectly.


Blake, who clearly couldn't stand seeing Laurel cry,tugged at his tie with obvious irritation. "You don't have any urgent matters, so there's no harm in staying to chat with Laurel." His tone left no room for argument as he added, "Ill take you home afterward and help you with what needs to be done."


What he meant by "what needs to be done" was deleting Astrid's photos.Clearly, Blake's implication was that if I didn't comply, he wouldn't delete the photos. This man was threatening me again for Laurel's sake.

I took a deep breath, suppressing my emotions, and laughed coldly. "Fine."

Laurel's insistence on having me stay must be part of some plan. I wanted to see what she planned to sayto me in front of Blake this time.
###Chapter 66: You Must Be Heartbroken insid

**Audrey's POV**

The moment I agreed to stay, Laurel's transformation was instantaneous.The tears that had been threatening to fall moments ago vanished like morning dew, replaced by a triumphant gleam that she didn't even try to hide. With practiced grace, she melted into Blake's arms, her fingers finding his sleeve with possessive intimacy.

"Blake darling, how wonderful! I knew you'd help convince Miss Sinclair to stay!"

She turned that perfectly calculated smile my way. "Miss Sinclair, thank you for agreeing to keep me company!"


I moved past them without acknowledgment, heading straight for the hospital room.


Blake's frown was almost audible as he disentangled himself from Laurel's clinging embrace. "Laurel, let's go in too."


As soon as Blake helped Laurel back to her bed with practiced care,she spoke up, "Blake darling," her voice quavered with measured distress,and one hand rose to touch her face. "I was crying... does my makeup look terrible? Am I a mess?"


I couldn't help but notice her perfectly intact makeup in the room's harsh fluorescent lighting. Only her eyes showed the slightest hint of redness-the kind that came from careful rubbing rather than genuine tears.

*What a performance*, I thought with grim amusement.

Blake's fingers found his temples - a gesture showing his resignation. "We'
Il get you cleaned up."

When he turned to me, his expression had already shifted into that particular blend of authority and annoyance. "Get some warm water for Laurel."

The casual command hit something raw inside me. After all these things,he still thought I was that same woman who would leap to fulfill his every whim.

A cold smile touched my lips as I met his gaze. "Mr. Parker, let me be clear. I agreed to stay and chat with your precious Miss Rose. I didn't agree to be her servant."

"It's not about being a servant," he snapped, "it's just a simple favor."

Looking at him-this man who had once been my whole world - I couldn't help but marvel at how much had changed. How many nights had I waited up, warm towel ready, fresh coffee brewing, desperate to prove my worth through these little services? The memory of my own devotion left a bitter taste in my mouth.

"Well, then," I leaned back in my chair."I refuse."

Something shifted in Blake's expression when I refused - a flicker of emotion I couldn't quite name. He stared at me longer than necessary, as if seeing a stranger wearing his wife'sface.

"Oh, it's okay if Miss Snclair doesn't want to help." Laurel's voice cut through the tension. She bit her lip, the perfect picture of delicate concern."I wouldn't want just anyone handling my water, they might get the temperature wrong..."

Then she turned to Blake, her expression softening into something
intimate and trusting. "Blake darling, would you mind getting it for me?You've taken care of me so many times, you know exactly how I like it.I trust you completely!"

Blake nodded. "Of course."

He moved toward the door but paused beside my chair. His voice dropped low. "Stay here, and don't make things difficult for Laurel."

I met his eyes, letting my smile match his coldness. "You should be saying that to your Miss Rose."

His eyes narrowed dangerously. "Laurel's the patient here. How could she possibly make things difficult for you?"

"Oh, Blake," Laurel's voice was pure sugar and light as she smiled up at Blake. "Don't fuss so. Miss Sinclair and I will be fine together."

She waved him away with elegant fingers. "Now hurry - my face feels absolutely dreadful."


Blake hesitated, his gaze moving between us before finally settling on me.Something flickered behind his eyes, but before I could tell what was it, he was gone, the door clicking shut behind him.

The change in LaureI was instant and chilling. The soft, vulnerable patient vanished, replaced by something sharp and calculating. Her smile turned predatory as she faced me.

"Satisfied? He believes everything now." Her voice had lost all trace of its earlier fragility.

"All this trouble just to get me alone?" I shifted in my chair, studying her with mild curiosity. The effort she'd put into this little performance was
almost impressive. Almost.

Her lips tightened. "The recording. When are you deleting it?"

Of course. Everything clicked into place. The tears, the dramatics, that masterful manipulation of Blake - all for this. I nearly laughed at the predictability of it all.

"Eventually." I met her gaze steadily. "But not today."

Something dangerous flashed in her eyes, but I pressed on before she could speak. "Though if you're that worried about your precious Blake darling finding out... you could always use those persuasive talents of yours. Get him to finalize our divorce."

Let them have their fairy tale ending. I was done trying to protect Blake from his own willful blindness. If he wanted to believe her performance,that was his choice.


**Laurel's POV**

Watching Audrey's casual dismissal of everything I held dear made my blood run cold. One month. Pd been back for an entire month, and here I was, clutching hospital sheets like some kind of invalid while she sat there wearing that infuriating mask of indifference.

Those divorce papers. They'd become my own personal nightmare.Blake brushed off every hint I dropped wit that same patronizing smile. "She'll come around," he'd say, like he was talking about a sulking child rather than his wife. "This isn't what she really wants." Each time he said those words, another piece of my carefully constructed world crumbled.

And now here she was, taunting me about "persuading" Blake. As if I hadn't tried everything. As if I hadn't spent weeks enduring his gentle
deflections, hearing him introduce me as his sister at every turn. No matter what I did, he maintained that careful, maddening distance.

I hadn't even kissed him, let alone other intimate interactions!

The fury building in my chest threatened to choke me. She was doing this deliberately - she had to be. Throwing my failures in my face, mocking my inability to secure what should have been mine years ago.

"Listen carefully," I managed to keep my voice steady despite the rage coursing through me. "Blake was planning our future long before I came back. HHe can't wait to make things official."


I watched for any crack in her composure, any sign that my words had found their mark. But that serene smile never wavered. "That's great then.I'm ready to end this too."

She delivered the words with the same casual indifference she might use to decline a dinner invitation. The calm in her voice made me want to scream.

"The sooner the better." Her calm response felt like acid on my skin. "I'm quite eager myself."


"Quite the performance." I couldn't keep the bitterness from my voice."You must be heartbroken inside."


The slight curve of her lips sent fresh waves of fury through me."Why would I be?"
###Chapter 67: Give Me Your Phone

**Audrey's POV**

I stared at Laurel's triumphant face as she finished declaring how Blake would do anything for her. The oxygen mask lay discarded on her hospital bed, all traces of her supposed illness vanished.

I'd figured out Blake's intentions long ago. He was more eager than anyone to finalize our divorce. A month before Laurel returned from Europe, he'd already reserved the venue and ordered the cake for his proposal. My heart had contracted briefly when I first learned about his plans, but that pain quickly transformed into relief.

After all, with his unpredictable temperament, I'd worried he might deliberately delay our divorce out of spite. If he dragged things past my remaining three months, I'd leave this world still carrying the Parker name.

When Laurel spoke those triumphant words, I felt nothing. No pain,no jealousy - just hollow amusement at her desperate need to claim victory in a battle I'd already conceded.

The door swung open, interrupting my thoughts. Blake walked in carrying a basin of warm water, a pink washcloth draped over his arm. He set the basin on Laurel's bedside table and handed her the washcloth with a gentleness I hadn't seen in years - at least not directed at me.

"Here you go," he said, his voice unusually soft.

He reached out and brushed a strand of hair from her forehead, fingers lingering just a moment too long.

"Thank you, Blake darling!" Laurel's voice dripped sweetness,her eyes
flicking briefly to me.

I watched their performance with detached coldness. T'hough I'd given up on Blake, seeing my legal husband act so tenderly with another woman still turned my stomach. The contrast between his coldness toward me and this display of affection was almost comical.

I stood up, smoothing down my skirt.

"Mr. Parker," I said, keeping my voice steady despite my fatigue. "Earlier you said once I finished chatting with Miss Rose, you'd take me home and handle what needs to be done. I've stayed as requested and our chat is over."


I asked directly. "When do you plan to take me home?"

Blake turned, annoyance flickering across his face. He tugged at his tie."At least wait until Laurel's cleaned up."

"So you'll take me home after Miss Rose finishes washing up?"


Instead of answering me, Blake turned to Laurel. "Laurel, what do you think?"


"Of course," she replied, dabbing at her face with the washcloth. "If Miss Sinclair is in such a hurry, I wouldn't want to keep her."

I sat back down while Laurel wiped her face with deliberate slowness.When she finally finished, she fixed me with a sharp stare.

"But Miss Sinclair, before you leave, please delete those unflattering photos you took of me."

The request caught me off guard."What photos?"
"Don't pretend," Laurel said, her expression hardening before melting into wounded innocence. "When Blake went to get water, you secretly took photos of meafter I'd been crying. I saw you!"

I stared at her, confused. I hadn't touched my phone since entering the room.

"As friends, I normally wouldn't mind... But I'm an actress...if those unflattering photos leaked..." She clutched the blanket. "My career... could be ruined."

Seeing Laurel being on the edge of tears. Blake let out a sigh and stepped toward me, eyes flashing. "Give me your phone."

I stepped back. "I didn't take any photos of her."

"Miss Sinclair, please..." Laurel's voice cracked. "Just delete them?"

"Miss Rose, don't push me."

Laurel turned away dramatically. "Miss Sinclair, I'm begging you..."

After being pushed down stairs and kicked in the stomach, this transparent manipulation was the final straw.

"Laurel Rose, my patience has limits!"

She turned back, dropping her wounded act. "Aren't you the one pushing boundaries? Not only do you misunderstand my relatiońship with Blake darling, but now you want to destroy my career..."

I felt my grip on sanity slipping.

This woman was unbelievable. I hadn't done a single thing she accused me of, yet here she was, twisting reality as she wanted.
Heat rushed to my face. My hands shook with barely contained rage as I yanked my phone from my pocket. "You want to play dirty, Laurel? Fine."

If she was determined to drag me through the mud, I'd make damn sure Blake saw her true colors. The recording would expose everything.

Before I could unlock the screen, Blake's hand swooped in and plucked the phone away.

In that instant, everything clicked. The accusation, the tears,the whole performance-it wwas all orchestrated to get my phone. She wasn't worried about unflattering photos; she wanted to destroy evidence of her own admission.


And like an idiot. I'd handed over exactly what she wanted.


"Give it back!" I lunged toward Blake, fingers grasping at air. "I never took any pictures of her!"

It was useless. Even stretching to my full height, I couldn't reach my phone as Blake held it overhead, keeping it just beyond my grasp.

**Blake's POV**


I kept the phone away from her and typed in my birthday-the password she'd used since day one.


The screen flashed: "Incorrect passcode. Please try again."

"You changed your password?" I looked at her,genuinely surprised.

"Yes."

She reached toward me. "Just give it back. I'll unlock it and delete whatever you want to see."
I stepped back. "No. Tell me the code and I'll do it."

Something changed in her face then. The fight drained out of her like someone had pulled a plug. She couldn't reach the phone,and I wasn't budging.

She took a deep breath, shoulders dropping. "Blake Parker, give me back my phone."

"I didn't take any photos of Laurel."

Her tone made me pause. That wasn't the indignant denial I'd expected,but resignation that sounded almost final.

I glanced at her face. Her eyes seemed hollow with exhaustion, as if her spirit had been drained away. Dark circles shadowed her gaze, and her skin looked unhealthy pale.

This hesitation bothered me. It was just a password, just some photos.Why did she look so defeated? Was Laurel mistaken about the photos?

I pushed the thought aside. If Audrey hadn't taken photos, she would have handed over her phone immedliately to prove it.

Laurel's voice cut through my confusion. "Blake darling, if Miss Snclair won't tell you the password, maybe there's something on her phone she doesn't want you to see."


"Let me handle it," she added. "I'm a woman, and I have no personal stake in this. I'd be the most appropriate person."

Her logic seemed sound. Laurel had no reason to go through Audrey's personal information.
"That makes sense." I agreed, moving toward her with the phone.

"NO!" Audrey shouted, lunging forward with unexpected speed.reaching for the phone.

The sudden movement surprised me. Laurel reached for the device just as Audrey grabbed for it, and in the confusion, Laurel's hand jerked. The phone slipped from her fingers and dropped directly into the basin of water.


The splash was small but definitive, followed by the distinct sound of electronics shorting out.
###Chapter 68: Do I Matter More Than Miss Si ncl air?

**Audrey's POV**

For a moment. I just stared at the basin, unable to process what had just happened. Water cascaded over theedge,forming a widening puddle on
the pristine hospital floor.

"I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!" Laurel cried out, horror painted across her face.


I stared at my submerged phone as it sparked and went dark.White smoke curled from the case. When I fished it out, water dripped from every crack and seam.

I crouched down, picking up the broken pieces, my throat tight. This wasn't just any phone. Rachel had given it to me four years ago, right before her accident - before she became unresponsive, before her family vanished to Europe with her. The last gift from my best friend.


Looking at the scattered components on the floor, my heart felt sliced open.Four years of messages and photos... and the recording that could have shown Blake who Laurel really was.

"Miss Sinclair, I'm so sorry..." LaureI's voice cut through my thoughts. She leaned back against her pillows, hand pressed to her chest."When you raised your voice, I got scared and my hand shook... then I knocked over the basin trying to help... I didn't mean to."

I gathered the fragments, each piece a lost connection to Rachel. The memory card was ruined too -all our shared moments gone.
"What model is your phone?" Laurel asked. "I'll replace it for you, okay?"

Something in her tone made me look up with ultimate anger. For just a second. I caught a flash of satisfaction in her eyes before she covered it with more fake concern.

I stood slowly. "You planned this all along, didn't you? Made me stay just so you could destroy my phone."

Laurel blinked rapidly. "Miss Sinclair, I don't know what you're talking about."


"No one knows better than you," I said.

I took a deep breath, fighting to stay calm. I carefully picked up the remaining pieces and dropped them in my purse.

"Do you think destroying my phone means you're safe now?" I asked,forcing a cold smile. "What if I have a backup?"

I could see her face paled instantly, and her hand froze mid-gesture.

"You're lying," she said, voice tight. Her teeth sank into her lower lip,eyes now filled with undisguised panic.

"You don't have any backup," she added, studying my face. "You're bluffing."


I closed my purse with a snap. "Whether I do or don't, you'll find out soon. Try to stay this calm when that happens."

As I turned to leave, Blake blocked my path, his expression dark.

"What did you back up? Photos of Laurel?" he dlemanded.
I stared at him, confused until I remembered Laurel's earlier accusation about unflattering photos.

"Didn't you say you hadn't taken any pictures of her?" His eyes narrowed to cold slits.

"I have zero interest in taking her photo," I said flatly. "As for what my backup contains... ask your precious Miss Rose. I'm done explaining myself to you."

Blake's forehead creased with confusion as I pushed past him.

Each step toward the exit sent pain shooting through my legs. The bruises from my tumble down the stairs throbbed in protest. Still, I forced myself to walk normally, refusing to show weakness.

The hallway stretched endlessly ahead. I gritted my teeth, focusing only on putting one foot in front of the other.

I was so focused that I didn't notice when my balance failed. My right leg buckled, throwing me off-center. I tried to recover but only made it worse.

*Too late.* By the time I realized I was falling, I couldn't stop it. I closed my eyes, bracing for impact with the hard floor.

Instead, strong hands caught me around the waist,pulling me against a solid chest. The familiar cedar scent crashed me- a smell that once meant safety,home, and lazy Sunday mornings.

The memory jolted me back to reality. I pulled away quickly, my face hot with embarrassment.

"Thank you," I muttered.
I turned to go,but Blake grabbed my wrist.

"Audrey." His voice mixed concern with irritation. His eyes dropped to my legs where bruises showed through my pants, "Are your injuries that bad?"

"No." I pulled my hand away. "I just tripped."

I kept walking, more careful this time. Each step still hurt, but I wouldn't give him the satisfaction of seeing it.

As I neared the elevator, dizziness washed over me. I paused,leaning against the wall for support. *Just a few more steps.*

**Blake's POV**

I watched Audrey walking away, noticing her slight limp despite her efforts to hide it. Dr. Bennett's words flashed through my mind.

I turned.back toward Laurel's room, then hesitated. What backup was Audrey talking about? Why had Laurel looked so scared?

I glanced down the hall where Audrey now leaned against the wall.struggling.

"She's hurt her legs," I said. "I'm going to check on her."

I was halfway to the door when Laurel's voice stopped me.

"Blake darling..." Her voice trembled perfectly. "You're leaving me alone?"

When I turned, she was sitting up, lips quivering, tears ready to fall. "I'll be scared by myself,.."

"It's fine," I said, trying to hide my frustration. "This is a hospital. There are doctors and nurses right outside. Just press the button if you need
anything."

I turned toward the door again, concerned about Audrey's condition.

"In your heart..." Laurel's voice rose suddenly, loud enough to echo down the hall. "Do I matter more than Miss Sinclair?"

The question stopped me cold. I'd never heard Laurel be so direct - or so loud, like she was performing for someone.

I looked down the hallway. Audrey had stopped, still leaning against the wall with her back to us. Had she heard? Of course she had - Laurel had practically shouted.


Was she really resting there because she felt weak, or was she waiting for my answer?


I almost laughed. Didn't she say she wanted a divorce? Acting like she doesn't care, but still needs to know where she stands?

After a pause, I sighed and went back to Laurel, tucking her blanket around her. But my eyes kept drifting to Audrey's still figure down the hall.


"Why are you asking this now?" I said, buying time.

Laurel's eyes glistened with tears. "I'm sick too, but youI'd leave me for her..



She grabbed my hand tightly. "Blake darling, tell me the truth - who matters more to you, me or Miss Sinclair?"

Her voice broke with emotion but stayed loud enough to carry down the hallway.
I'd been here before - trapped between honesty and protecting Laurel's fragile health. But knowing Audrey was listening made my chest tighten uncomfortably.

"Remember what I told you when we first reunited?" I finally said, loud enough to be heard.


Laurel's eyes brightened instantly. "You said besides your family, I was the most important person to you!"

The words stuck in my throat. "Yes. What I said then still stands."


As I spoke. I stared at Audrey's distant figure. Even from far away, I saw her body tremble slightly. Then she pushed herself off the wall and continued her slow walk toward the elevator.


My heart felt squeezed in a vise. The feeling was so intense I barely heard Laurel's response.

"So Blake darling, you mean in your heart, I'm still more important than Miss Sinclair,right?" Laurel's voice rose with excitement, clearly meant for Audrey's ears.


"I knew it! Blake darling,you care about me the most!"
###Chapter 69:We're Still Married!

**Audrey's POV**

I limped toward the elevator, each step sending pain through my bruised
legs. When I reached it, I pressed the button and leaned against the wall,
needing its support more than I wanted to admit.

Laurel's question still echoed in my head: *"Do I matter more than MMiss Sinclair?"* Despite everything, I'd had that stupid, tiny hope when she asked it. But Blake's answer had been clear enough.


Though I didn't get the answer I secretly wanted to hear, there wasn't much turmoil in my heart. Everyone in New York knew Blake Parker preferred Laurel Rose. The way he looked at her, the tenderness in his voice when he spoke to her-it was obvious. I had no reason not to accept it.


The elevator arrived empty, and I stepped inside. Justas the doors began to close, a hand shot through the gap. Blake stepped in, immediately making the space feel smaller.

*Didn't he just finish cozying up to Laurel? How is he here now?* With this thought, I moved to the opposite corner. "Aren't you staying to take care of your Miss Rose?"

Blake pressed the button and turned to me. "I promised I'd take you home and take care of what needs to be done."

I frowned, confused by his words. "What do you mean?"

"Don't you want to see me delete those photos?" he added.

Right. The blackmail photos of Astrid. With everything else, I'd nearly
forgotten.

"So, Mr. Parker, you came after me to fulfill your promise?" I kept my voice flat. "I can get home alone. Just delete the photos in front of me.You can do it right here."

"So eager to avoid being around me?"

"I just don't want to affect your relationship with Miss Rose."

His mouth twisted into a cold smile. "You couldn't affect us even if you tried."


My fake smile instantly froze on my face.

He was right. I was being ridiculous. If I could actually influence their relationship, they wouldn't still be together after three years. It was just a ride home-why make things harder for myself?


The elevator slowed to a stop, and the doors opened. I glanced up at the floor indicator, surprised to see we were not in the lobby. I instinctively turned to go back into the elevator, but Blake blocked the doorway.

He spoke up, "You can barely walk. Want to risk another fall?"

Hearing this, I realized we were on the second floor of the hospital, where they treated external injuries and trauma.

I frowned and tried to reach past him for the button. "I know my legs better than anyone. I don't needyour concern."

"You need to get those injuries checked right away."

"No. You said you'd take me home and delete the photos," I said."Having you escort me to a doctor wasn't part of the deal. I refuse."
He crossed his arms. "Don't you care about your own body? Have you seen the bruises on your legs?"

"I don't need your concern!"

Blake's expression darkened. His voice could have frozen water. "Audrey Sinclair, we're still married!"

I met his glare. "So what does it matter?"

Deciding this conversation was going nowhere, I turned andI began walking toward the stairwell. "If I hadn't been sick and missed our appointment that day, our marriage would have been over already."

His hand shot out, grabbing my wrist. I turned back to face him.


"You missed the appointment because you didn't want the divorce,right?"His tone was smug, certain.

I stared at him in disbelief.

"Audrey, there's a limit to how far you can push this act." His grip tightened. "Play the divorce cad too many times and it might actually happen."


I pulled my arm free. Even now, he thought I didn't really want a divorce?That I was just making a scene? After three years, Blake had never truly understood me. He believed I was acting out, that I didn't want to leave him.


He thought the divorce drama had ended when I "hid" in the hospital instead of signing the papers. And now he was annoyed I'd brought it up again.
I turned toward the stairwell door, pushing it open with more force than necessary. The dim emergency lighting cast long shadows as I approached the first step. Whether from anger or the dim light, I missed the first step entirely, and my body tumbled toward the stdirs-

**Blake's POV**

I lunged forward without thinking. One second she was standing there,the next falling headfirst into the dark stairwell. I caught her arm and yanked her back, the force sending her spinning into my chest.

She hit me hard enough that I had to brace myself. I wrapped my arms around her, steadying us both. Her hair smelled like vanilla - simple,nothing like Laurel's expensive perfumes.

Her heart hammered against my chest, her breathing quick and shallow from the scare. I ran my hand down her back, feeling her trembling.

"You already fell down the stairs once this morning," I said. "Want to try again?"

She didn't respond, still pressed against me.

"One more time and you might break your leg."

After a moment, she took a breath and pulled away. Just like that,her face was composed again, as if nothing had happened.

"Thank you," she said, turning to grip the stair railing.

Looking at her stubborn, too-thin back as she prepared to try the stairs again, I made a decision. This woman was going to hurt herself out of pure pride.
I stepped forward and lifted her into my arms. She weighed less than I remembered-too little.

She let out a startled sound, grabbing my collar to steady herself.Seeing this, I tried hard to stifle my laugh.

When she realized what was happening, surprise quickly turned to anger.

"Let me go!" Her voice echoed in the stairwell.


"Let you go? So you can fall down the stairs again?" I carried her back through the door into the hallway. "Do you have a death wish or something?"


"That's none of your bussiness" Her eyes flashed with genuine anger.

She pushed against my chest. "Put me down! Let me go!"

Watching her fight finally made me smile despite myself. The Audrey I'd lived with for years was always calm, controlled, proper - like she was following some rulebook for perfect wives. Since filing for divorce, she'd shown more real emotion than in our entire marriage.

Thinking about this, I felt a mischievous impulse. I loosened one arm holding her, pretending I might actually drop her. "Keep struggling and I'Il really let go and let you fall."
###Chapter 70:I Can Carry You

**Audrey's POV**

My body lifted into the air with unexpected ease. "Don't!" I warned,arms automatically wrapping around his neck.

Being pushed down the stairs by Laurel this morning and kicked in the stomach hours ago had left me with enough bruises. If Blake dropped me now, I'd be one giant walking bruise.

When my arms circled his neck, Blake froze. His rhythm faltered, like a skipped heartbeat. I looked up and caught him staring at me, the corner of his mouth twitching upward.

As our eyes met, something turned different. His eyes, usually unreadable,held an expression I'd never seen directed at me before.

The corridor buzzed with activity-doctors rushing past, nurses with patients, worried family members huddled together. Yet somehow, those sounds faded away. Just Blake and me, locked in a moment I couldn't explain.


"What are you two doing?"

Laurel's voice cut through our bubble. A nurse pushed her in a wheelchair,her posture looking fragile. Her tearful eyes moved between us.

"Blake darling, didn't you say you were just escorting Miss Sinclair to the trauma unit?" Her voice quivered. "You liedto me!"

Blake snapped back to reality. His brow furrowed, and he set me down so quickly I almost fell. My legs buckled, and I grabbed the wall railing to steady myself.
"Laurel, don't cry, it's my fault." Blake said, crossing to her in three long strides.He handed her a tissue. "Weren't you supposed to be resting in your room?"

Laurel hugged Blake's waist, resting her head against his stomach. Over his back, she caught my eye, triumph flashing across her face before returning to wounded innocence.

"Blake darling. I trusted you so much... If you had just told me you wanted to take Miss Sinclair here, I wouldn't have objected... Why did you lie to me?"


Her fingers curled into his shirt possessively.

"Have you forgotten what you once told me? That you would never lie to your good girl..."

Blake sighed. "Laurel. I'm... sorry. I just didn't want you to worry..."

I leaned against the wall, catching my breath. A bitter laugh nearly escaped my lips.


*"Never lie to his good girl..."* Blake had said those exact words to me five years ago.


Back then, I was the stranger who found him in that small town,who cared for him when he had no one. During those quiet days, he made promises. He'd never lie to me. Once he recovered, he,would find me,repay my kindness, take responsibility.

I waited, day after, day, night after night. Then, a year later, I saw him with Laurel Rose, the perfect couple in every gossip column.

I thought he'd forgotten his promises. Now I understood the truth-he
hadn't forgotten his promises, just the ones he made to me. Every word to Laurel, he remembered perfectly. Every promise to her,he kept.

The difference between love and its absence.

"Miss Sinclair."

Laurel's voice snapped me back. She watched me from her wheelchair,smiling.


"Why did you make Blake hold you like that? Is it because your legs can't walk anymore?" She stood up smoothly. "You should have said something!I'd have given you this wheelchair. Don't you know you and Blake darling should be keeping your distance now?"

My knuckles turned white gripping the railing. We were still legally married. Since when did a husband carrying his injured wife need explaining?

"Laurel!" Blake cut in.

"I promised my grandfather I would take care of her," he explained.

"Taking care of her means holding her in your arms?" Laurel's voice rose,pulling attention from everyone nearby. "Blake darling, you're just too kind-hearted. You don't understand some women's tactics!"

She turned to the growing crowd. "This is a hospital with plenty of staff and wheelchairs. If she's really hurting, there are professional ways to help.
Why did she need you to carry her?"

People started whispering, looking between us.

"Isn't that Laurel Rose, the actress who just got back from Europe? And
that's Blake Parker, her boyfriend."

"I heard he waited three years while she was gone."

A bitter smile formed on my lips at these words.

**Blake's POV**

The whispers grew louder, bolder.

"Sounds like ths woman's trying to steal someone's boyfriend."

"Shameless. Going after another woman's man."

"Who does she think she is? Just because her legs hurt, does she need someone else's boyfriend carrying her around? No sense of boundaries."


Hearing these words. I frowned as I rubbed Laurel's back, trying to calm her, but my eyes kept drifting to Audrey. She stood against the wall, face pale as she listened to the whispers. That bitter smile on her lips made my chest hurt.


These accusations were completely unfair. None of these people knew she was actually my wife, not some random home-wrecker. The irony would be funny if it weren't so messed up.

I was about to say something when a tall figure pushed through the crowd.


Ethan Davies stepped beside Audrey, positioning himself ,between her and the onlookers.

"This is a hospital, not a gossip column," he said firmly. "Your negative energy isn't helping anyone heal."

The crowd scattered, grumbling. "Whatever. Just trying to see what's
happening and this guy has to ruin it..."

Ethan turned to Audrey, concern evident. "Miss Sinclair, you okay?"

She shook her head with a pale smile. "Thank you."

"No need for thanks," he replied, glancing at her legs. "You're here for those injuries,right?"


Before she could answer, he lifted her into his arms. She looked startled but didn't resist.


"Miss Sinclair, if your husband would rather console her than help you,that's his loss!" Ethan said loud enough for me to hear. "I can carry you,and I can do it all day!"

**Audrey's POV**

Panic fluttered in my chest at being carried by someone else. I bit my lip and glanced at Blake. He was staring at us with a complicated expression.


The memory of last night's confrontation between them made me nervous.Blake had been unnecessarily harsh with Ethan, and I worried the young man was inviting more trouble. I was about to pull away when Ethan leaned closer.


"Miss Sinclair, I've been watching this whole thing and finally got the guts to step in. Please don't turn me away."


His voice carried a hint of pleading beneath its confidence.

"Ethan, you're being... too impulsive," I said quietly.

He was young and talented with a bright future. Getting involved with me-terminal with only months left-was pointless. He didn't need this
complication.

But looking at his earnest face. I took a deep breath and stopped resisting.I pretended to wrap my arms around his neck, careful not to actually touch him, creating just the illusion of closeness.

I turned back to Laurel, who watched us with thinly veiled anger."Miss Rose,thanks for offering your wheelchair, but I don't need it. You should keep it."


A small victory, but I'd tae what I could get.

"Ethan,shall we?"


With a bright smile, Ethan nodded and carried me toward the examination room, away from Blake and Laurel and all their drama.
###Chapter 71: Don't Get Her Involved

**Laurel's POV**

That man carried Audrey away like she was some fragile princess.Jealousy crept through me. How could plain, ordinary Audrey attract someone young and handsome?


But underneath that jealousy was satisfaction. Perfect! Being carried by another man right in front of Blake would surely damage his opinion of her.


I looked up at Blake with a concerned smile. "Miss Sinclair is popular..."

Blake said nothing, just watched them leave.

"Isn't that the same man who was with her yesterday?" I kept my voice curious,not accusing. "He said he was just taking care of Miss Sinclair,but now it seems their relationship is quite... special."

When I turned back to see Blake's reaction, the coldness in his eyes made me look away.


"Blake darling..." I started.

"Laurel." His voice was flat. "Did you do that deliberately?"

My heart raced. Had I miscalculated?

"I don't know what you're talking about..." I adjusted my breathing. "
Blake darling, do you think I... deliberately raised my voice to embarrass Miss Sinclair?"


I looked up at him, tears forming. "How could you think that of me? We'
ve known each other for years. I just... got too emotional."

**Blake's POV**

I studied Laurel's teary eyes. She was a Hollywood star who should know better than to cause scenes in public. Yet she'd drawn a crowd,making Audrey their target.


People had recorded everything on their phones. If those videos went online, it would be a PR nightmare. Despite Audrey's insistence on divorce,she was still legally my wife. Any scandal involving her would affect Parker Group.


My gaze cooled as I looked at Laurel. This wasn't the first time she'd been impulsive and emotional without thinking about consequences. Was-it calculated, like Audrey had suggested? The thought made me uneasy.

Movement caught my eye. Audrey was walking toward us,each step careful but determined despite her injuries. The young man was behind her. For some reason, that pleased me.

Her face was composed, but there was a hardness in her eyes I rarely saw during our marriage.


"Too emotional?" she said. "Miss Rose, that excuse might only fool your'Blake darling."


She stopped in front of us, looking down at Laurel in the wheelchair."Miss Rose claims she raised her voice because she was too emotional. May I ask,why were you emotional?"

She met my eyes briefly. "Mr. Parkerand I are still legally married. He has every right to carry me, or even share a bed with me. It's certainly not your place to get emotional about it."
Her directness caught me off guard. During our marriage, Audrey had always been careful with her words, especially around others.

"You've been publicly parading around with Blake every day lately," she told Laurel. "Do you think that makes you the wife and me the mistress?"

I kept my face neutral, though her words hit home. It was true - I had been appearing with Laurel at events, creating exactly the impression Audrey described. But that was different. I owed Laurel for saving my life,and her health needed my support.


"What right do you have to demand that my husband and I keep our distance?" Audrey's voice dropped low. "What right do you have to get emotional seeing my husband carry me?"


"Also, Miss Rose," she continued, taking out her phone, "as an actress,hasn't your agency taught you to be careful whát you say and do in public?



She showed us her screen. "Since you were just 'too emotional' earlier, how do you explain this?"


I leaned forward to see -news stories already flooding social mediá. The hospital argument, Laurel's outburst, the crowd's judgment-all packaged with headlines like "Blake Parker's Secret Lover Confronted by Mystery Woman" and "Hollywood Star Laurel Rose Defends Relationship with Billionaire Blake Parker Against Homewrecker."


"Apparently I'm the homewrecker, and Miss Rose is the legitimate partner,"Audrey said with a bitter smile.

I stared at the news feed. These outlets worked faster than I'd expected.Barely ten minutes had passed since the argument,yet videos were already
headline news.

"I'm just a regular person," Audrey said, putting away her phone. "I don't want to be all over the internet. Please fix this quickly."

She took a breath. "Otherwise, I'll post my marriage certificate with Mr.Parker online. Then everyone will know who the real mistress is."


Laurel's face almost went white in an instant. Her hand flew to her throat.She bit her lip and stared at Audrey. "You're upset about being in the news, so you're taking it out on me?" Her voice shook. "I didn't ask them to publish those stores. Why blame me?"

She grabbed my arm. "I only raised my voice becauseI was upset. What did I do wrong?"


Tears filled her eyes as she looked up at me. "Blake darling, I've been with you the whole time. You know those news stories have nothing to do with me!"


Her voice rose. "I haven't even touched my phone. Those reporters and stories - I didn't arrange them! What right does Miss Sinclair have to accuse me!"


I weighed the facts. Laurel was right -she hadn't touched her phone since Audrey left. Her distress seemed real, though with actresses, it's sometimes hard to tell where the act ends and reality begins.

"The online news isn't Laurel's doing," I said firmly. "She hasn't touched her phone. Don't wrongfully accuse her."

The medical student-Ethan Davies-appeared beside Audrey. He'd followed her back and stood too close for my liking.
"Mr. Parker," he said wwith annoying confidence.

"I know that as CEO of Parker Group, you're powerful enough to investigate my background instantly." His lips curled into a cold smile as he showed us news on his phone. "So you should know better than I do that for news to spread this fast, someone must be pulling strings."

He glanced at Laurel. "And your Miss Rose, being a major Hollywood star,knows all about trending topics and media hype. Do you really think we're wrongfully accusing her?"

Something dark flared inside me. Him carrying Audrey earlier had already bothered me, though I'd let it go since he helped her out of a tough spot.


But I never expected this nobody would dare lecture me. Audrey was my wife; she could say whatever she wanted to me. But who did Ethan Davies think he was? A medical student with no connections, presuming to school me on my own business?

"Who gave you the balls to talk to me like this?" I kept my voice low.


I turned to Audrey. "You found someone real stupid to help you.How many times can you protect him?"


The threat hung between us. Her face paled as she stepped forward,blocking my view of Ethan. The protective move surprised me -it was instinctive, genuine in a way I rarely saw from her lately.

"He's just worried about me," she said quietly but firmly.

"Does he need to be?" I asked coldly.

The question carried more weight than I meant it to. Was I jealous? That made no sense. Audrey wanted a divorce. She obviously wanted nothing
to do with me. So why did seeing her defend this guy piss me off so much?

I laughed coldly and checked the news on my phone again before putting it away.

"I'll handle the news," I said. "It won't affect you. And I'll find out who's behind all this."

I stared at Audrey, my eyes narrowing. "Laurel is innocent in this. Don't get her involved."
###Chapter 72: No Offense Intended

**Audrey's POV**

Watching Blake defend Laurel yet again, I couldn't help but laugh coldly to myself.


Five years ago, when I fell for Blake Parker, I thought he hung the moon.The perfect man - brilliant, handsome, unstoppable.

Now? Watching him dance to Laurel's every tune, I was finally waking up.The man I once worshipped was just... ordlinary. Another guy blinded by a pretty face and some well-timed tears.


It was almost funny how easily she controlled him. One word from her carried more weight than my years of loyalty. The great Blake Parker, CEO of Parker Group, brought to heel by a quivering lip.

I'd been so blind. Not only had I wasted five years on this man, but I'd literally sacrificed my health for him. The sleepless nights caring forhim during his coma, skipping meals, ruining my stomach - all for what? To be treated like a stranger while he fawned over the woman who'd abandoned him.


"Audrey." Ethan's voice was low. "Don't forget, the photos!"


I blinked, suddenly remembering what actually mattered. Right. The blackmail photos of Astrid.

"When you say don't involve her," I said, looking directly at Blake,"do you mean you don't want me to post our marriage certificate online and let everyone know she's the other woman?"

Blake frowned but said nothing.
Laurel's hands clenched into fists as she sat in her wheelchair. "Miss Sinclair, you know better than anyone who the real 'other woman'is!" Her voice cracked with indignation. "If you dare post your marriage certificate online, I'll tell everyone how you forced your way into Blake darling's life three years ago and married him against his will!"

"Go ahead," I replied simply.

My response threw her. Hler eyes widened.

"You say I interfered with your relationship three years ago," I continued."But the truth is, after Mr. Parker's car accident left him in a coma,you didn't even look at him before fleeing to Europe overnight." I tilted my head. "What excuse did you give when you left,Miss Rose?"

Laurel's face drained of color. "You... you!" she spluttered, her finger shaking.


"Laurel." Blake's voice softened as he quickly moved to her side. His eyes,when they found mine, were cold. "Don't go too far!"

"Laurel had her reasons five years ago!" he added, standing protectively beside her wheelchair.


Ethan chuckled. "Her boyfriend becomes comatose, and she disappears overseas without even saying goodbye?" His tone was casual. "Sounds like she was afraid a vegetable would ruin her plans."

He shook his head. "No reason justifies that."

Ethan looked directly at Blake's darkening expression. "Sir, I'm just commenting on gossip I overheard. No offense intended."

"Blake darling..." Laurel's voice quavered as she gripped his hand. "Don't
be angry. Let them talk... I don't care what others think, only that you understand..."

Blake frowned before looking coldly at me. "I said I would handle the news online. You don't need to target Laurel." His voice hardened. "She's innocent."


I rolled my eyes.

"Blake darling, thank you for believing me," Laurel said,hugging his waist.
"Without you... I'd be completely misunderstood..."

I rolled my eyes again. Oscar-worthy performance.

"Audrey, the photos," Ethan murmured.

Right. This wasn't about exposing Laurel. This was about protecting Astrid.

"Since you don't want me to post ouar marriage certificate or mention what happened three years ago, I canagree," I said flatly. "However... I want Mr.
Parker to agree to three things."

I met his gaze. "If you agree, I'll never mention our marriage or the past to anyone."


Blake narrowed his eyes. "Tell me."

"First, fulfill what you promised - delete those photos and their backups,and pay what I won at the racetrack."

Blake stared,calculating.

"Second, remove all negative news about me online."

I took a breath. "Lastly... let's divorce within three days."
"Great!" Laurel exclaimed before Blake could respond. "It's decided!"

Ethan leaned back. "Obvious much?" he said. "Miss Rose sure seems eager." He glanced at Blake. "Since she's all for it, just do it. Delete the photos and pay up."

*I originally planned to wait for Blake to file for divorce. But seeing him with Laurel made me sick. Why drag this out? With terminal cancer, I don't have time for games.*


Blake glared at Ethan, then at me, before nodding curtly.

Relief, not happiness, washed over me.

**Blake's POV**

I took out my phone, glancing coldly at this young man hovering around Audrey. The guy irritated me on sight.

"You two seem close," I said, my words sharp.

Ethan grinned lazily. "Problem with that?" he asked. "You can hang all over Laurel, but Audrey can't have friends?"

"If you want someone to act with you, find someone more convincing."
The kid was obviously trying to get under my skin.

"We're not acting," Audrey said lightly. "Besides, his abs feel great." She looked straight at me. "Much better than yours."

I stared, genuinely shocked. "You're not that shallow!"

This wasn't the Audrey I knew. My wife was always dignified-not this provocative stranger throwing cheap shots.
"Sorry. I've always been this shallow," she replied with a smirk. "If I hadn't fallen for your face, you think I'd have married you?"

I walked over and held out my phone. Whatever game she was playing,I wasn't here for it.


I deleted the photos of her friend and their backups as she watched, then transferred the bet money to her account. These petty demands as conditions for divorce. Ridiculous.


As I pocketed my phone, I smirked. Let her have this little win.


Unexpectedly, she leaned close to my ear. "I've touched them," she whispered. "Trust me. it's no competition. You lose, Mr. Parker."

My smile vanished, anger burning through me. She was lying. She had to be. We were still married!

Audrey raised an eyebrow at my reaction. "Now that the photos are gone and the money's transferred, we won't bother you," she said normally. "Remember to clean up that news about me, and don't forget divorce court in three days."


She turned away. "Ethan, let's go."

"The bet money just hit," he said, checking his phone. "Treating me to dinner?"


"Sure," she replied, taking his arm exactly like Laurel always did with me."Wherever you want. I can afford it..."

I watched them walk away, fury building inside me.

*I thought after she missed our court date,the divorce drama was over.
Now she's not only pushing for it but flaunting other men in my face?Playing me, trying to make me look like a fool! This isn't how it works.She's gone too far.*

My fists clenched at my sides as they disappeared down the hall.


"Blake darling," Laurel's voice pulled me back.

"Am I causing trouble again?" she asked, eyes wide. "Since I returned, I've just created problems." She bit her lip. "I've even caused your divorce...you don't blame me, do you?"

I took her hand. "It's no trouble," I said firmly. "If she wants a divorce so badly, why should I fight it?"


A wave of irritation swept through me as I stared at the empty hallway.She thought she was punishing me? Fine. Let her go play house with that Nobody.


*If we divorce, I definitely won't be the one with regrets!*

Yet even as I thought it, my jaw clenched tight enough to ache.
###Chapter 73: What Have You Done?

**Audrey's POV**

"Thanks for earlier," I said to Ethan as we walked away from Mayo Clinic.
I handed back his phone. "If you hadn't stepped in, those people would've
kept staring, and I wouldn't have seen the stories online."

We found a small café between a pharmacy and a bookstore, the kind of place with mismatched chairs and regulars who never needed to order.The jasmine tea came in chipped mugs that somehow made it taste better.


Ethan pocketed his phone. "No wonder you didn't answer my messages.Your phone was broken."

"You sent messages?"

"Yeah." He fiddled with his napkin. "When Blake dragged you to the hospital, I saw how rough he was being. I got worried, so I texted you."

His eyes went puppy-dog sad. "When you didn't answer, I thought maybe I was too much of a nobody for you to bother with."

I smiled despite myself. "And then?"

"Then I saw the drama on the second floor." He shrugged.

I stirred my tea, watching leaves swirl at the bottom. The bruises from this morning's fall down the stairs throbbed dully beneath my clothes.

Ethan took a careful sip. "Your husband..." He hesitated. "Miss Rose ditched him when he was in a coma,right? Now she's back just when he's on top again." He frowned. "Why isn't he pissed at her? Why divorce you instead?"
"Favoritism," I said, tasting my tea. "He likes her, so she gets away with anything."

For years. I'd tried to understand Blake Parker. I'd made excuses for his coldness, his distance, his inability to see me. I used to think he just didn't understand emotions. Until Laurel returned from Europe... only then did I realize he wasn't emotionally stunted. He simply didn't love me.

Besides, I didn't have much time left anyway.

"Doesn't it break your heart?" Ethan asked, looking genuinely curious.

"I got over it a while ago." The words came easily after so much practice."
Life's too short to dwell on failed marriages."

I sipped my tea. "Too many leaves."


Ethan watched me with undisguised fascination. Though thin and pale these days, I still had a maturity he couldn't find in college girls. I could practically see his heart skip.


He glanced at his watch. "I've got class. Should probably head out."

"Of course. Thanks for hanging out."

"Will you be okay?"

"Sure. I need to get my phone fixed anyway."


After an awkward tussle over the bill - which I won - we parted ways. He headed toward NYU while I turned downtown, hunting for someone who could salvage Rachel's last gift to me.

Downtown buzzed with life as I searched for phone repair shops. My legs protested with each step, but I pushed forward.
Shop after shop gave me the same answer: water damage this extensive couldn't be fixed. The circuit board was fried,the memory card corrupted.Nothing salvageable.

As darkness fell over the city, I finally accepted reality. Rachel's phone couldn't be repaired. Just like how Rachel would never return to hug me and call my name again.

The memory hit unexpectedly - Rachel's laughter as she handed me the phone box four years ago. "You need to upgrade, Audrey! This dinosaur you're using is embarrassing me!" One month later, she was in a "car accident," and the vibrant woman who had been my closest friend became an unresponsive body in a hospital bed before her family whisked her to Europe for "specialized treatment."

I never heard from her again.

As I almost lost my hope, I found an old shop tucked on a side street.The elderly owner could fix my phone.

"But it will take about a week," he said, squinting at his computer."The parts for this old model are not easy to find these days.."

I placed the order, bought a basic temporary phone, and caught a taxi home. Exhaustion settled deep in my bones. My stomach ached with that familiar pain - a constant reminder of the countdown timer on my life.Three months. Maybe less.


By the time the taxi pulled up to my building, night had fallen. I paid the driver and stepped out, taking a breath of cool evening air.

I'd barely taken two steps when a dark figure rushedtoward me.Strong hands grabbed my jaw, fingers digging into my skin as I was slammed
against the wall.

Through the shock, I registered Blake's face inches from mine, twisted with fury.

"Blake Parker, what's wrong with you!?" I said, fighting against his grip.

His fingers tightened on my jaw. "What's wrong with me? You've lost it!"His eyes darkened with rage. "We agreed at the hospital that I would handle the news. What the hell have you done!?"

I was pinned against the wall, unable to move. My stomach twisted with pain, and my head started to spin - familiar symptoms of my condition worsening under stress.

I struggled to break free from his grip. "Tell me what I supposedly did!The entire afternoon, I'd been downtown looking for repair shops to fix my phone!" I hadn't even been online since leaving the hospital. Whatever he was accusing me of, it wasn't possible.

**Blake's POV**

"Look for yourself!" I pulled my phone out and threw it at her.

I'd meant to show her the screen, to force her to see what she'd done. But my control slipped.


The phone hit her face. She bent forward, covering her nose. Blood trickled between her fingers.

I froze. I hadn't meant to hurt her - not physically. I reached out instinctively to help.

Then I saw the screen of the phone on the ground. Our marriage certificate,
right there on that damn social media post. I pulled my hand back. No.After what she'd done, she deserved worse than a bloody nose.

Audrey stayed crouched, covering her face. Finally, she looked at the phone screen. Her eyes widened in shock.

Despite the blood, she picked up the phone to look closer. I knew exactly what she was seeing - photos of our marriage certificate posted by some anonymous account, with a detailed story. The post claimed they couldn't stand watching a celebrity homewrecker bullying an ordinary person, so they were "exposing the truth."

The post laid out everything chronologically: how Laurel abandoned me when I was in a coma, and how Audrey cared for me. The most damaging part claimed the Parkers had forced Audrey to marry me using our wealth and influence.


The internet erupted immediately. Comments flooded in calling Laurel and me cheaters. People swarmed Parker Group's social accounts with insults.Our PR team rushed out a statement that private lives were separate from company business, but nobody cared. In one afternoon, our stock dropped ten points. Billions in losses.


Audrey stared at the phone, clearly stunned. Blood dripped from her nose as she scrolled through the catastrophe.

"Someone who knows everything about us and has photos of our marriage certificate..." I glared at her. "This must be your account,or you had that college kid make it."


She started to speak,but I cut her off.

"Laurel is in emergency care because of this, and my grandfather is in the
hospital." I searched her face for any sign of remorse.

"Audrey Sinclair, tell me, is this the result you wanted?"
###Chapter 74:How Is William?

**Blake's POV**

Audrey lifted her head, her movements slow. The harsh lights showed the paleness of her face. Her eyes held actual worry.

"How is William?" Her voice came out rough.

I stood still, looking her over coldly. The damage from the online posts was still happening, and my phone constantly buzzing with panicked calls.And here she was,pretending to care.

She pressed a hand against her stomach, wincing. "I know nothing about the online posts."


"You've already deleted the photos and transferred the money from my race win," she said pushing herself up from the wall. "I have no reason to do this."


She leaned back against the wall, looking tired. "William... how is he really?



I studied her face. The concern didn't look fake. Either she was a great actress,or she actually cared about my grandfather.


I frowned and grabbed my car keys. Mydriver was waiting outside,engine running.


Audrey watched me, one hand moving to her chest, and followed me to the car without speaking.

We settled into the backseat. Audrey sat as far from me as possible,looking out the window.
"To Mayo Clinic," I told the driver.

Audrey's head turned toward me. "Why there?"

I kept my eyes forward. "Grandfather just has high blood pressure from being upset."

I turned away, giving her my profile. "Laurel is in emergency care at Mayo Clinic, so we've arranged for him to be there too. More convenient."

I laughed without humor. "Besides, even someone like you who likes to pretend to be sick enjoys staying at Mayo Clinic. Grandfather going there for treatment doesn't mean anything serious, right?"

She bit her lip but said nothing. Her silence bothered me-it denied me the reaction I wanted. The old Audrey would have defended herself.This new version just took it.

The rest of the drive passed in silence. When we arrived at Mayo Clinic,Audrey didn't wait for the car to stop. She pushed the door open and jumped out, moving quickly for someone who seemed so tired earlier.

I followed, watching her frantic movements with confusion. If she cares so much about Grandfather, why would she do something like this? Doesn't she know hurting Parker Group would hurt him too? Doesn't she know his health can't handle this stress?


By the time I reached William's room on the third floor, Audrey had already gone inside. I paused at the door when I heard her voice, thick with emotion.

**Audrey's POV**

I threw the door open, barely noticing the nurse who stepped aside. The
only thing that mattered was William.

"William!" I rushed to him, throwing my arms around him. "Are you alright?"

William stiffened in surprise at first. Then he patted my trembling back.

"I'm fine. I'm fine," he said, his voice strong as usual. "Nothing's wrong."

I pulled back to look at his face. He looked the same-a bit tired around the eyes, but none of the weakness I'd feared.

He saw me studying him and laughed. "You know my health. Those emergency pills' I use to scare them are just vitamins. How could anything be wrong with me?"

His familiar joke-William often exaggerated health problems to manipulate his family-made my throat tighten. I let go of him slowly,my lip trembling.

"If you're really fine, why are you here..." My voice caught.

William reached out and took my hand,his grip still strong.

"I just couldn't calm down after seeing that news online, and my blood pressure went up," he said with a small smile. "The doctors insisted on keeping me overnight, that's all."

Hearing him talk like normal made my chest hurt. Since deciding to leave,I'd missed him terribly.

He looked at me mòre seriously. "The online news,have you seen it all?"

Before I could answer, Blake's cold voice cut in from the doorway.
"The online news was released by her. How could she not know about it?"

Blake stood at the threshold, arms crossed. The sight of him made my chest tighten.

"The online news..." I started, trying to explain.

William interrupted with a snort. "The online news wasn't posted by Audrey. Don't blame her! If Audrey wanted to expose you and Laurel Rose cheating, she wouldn't have waited until today!"

Blake stepped into the room, frowning. "Grandfather, don't talk like that.What do you mean by 'cheating'? Laurel and I have a completely innocent relationship!"

He glanced at me, his lips curling. "Besides, she married me while I was in a coma,forcing herself between Laurel and me. Now, what right does she have to post our marriage certificate online, making Laurel look like the other woman?"


Each word stung. The pain in my stomach got worse-stress always made my condition flare up.

"How many times must I say it?" I met his cold stare. "I didn't do this."

Blake leaned against the doorframe. "If it wasn't you, then explain the marriage certificate photos. After our marriage,you kept the certificates,even taking them when you moved out. How could they end up in someone else's hands?"


He took out his phone and showed me the screen. "Isn't this your apartment's living room?"

I looked at the photo and froze. There it was-our marriage certificate,
clearly photographed on my apartment's couch. The blue throw pillow was visible in the corner, its pattern unmistakable.

I stared in confusion. The certificate had never left the hidden compartment in my suitcase. I'd only taken it out once since our wedding-when packing to leave the Parker mansion. Even Astrid didn't know I had it.

William broke the silence. "Even if the marriage certificate is with Audrey,and the photo is from her home, this doesn't prove she took it or posted it.



He waved his hand. "Instead of accusing an innocent person, you should investigate properly."


Blake frowned, sounding tired. "Grandfather, Audrey has caused Parker Group's stock to crash. Shareholders want answers... yet you're still defending her?"


"Because I know her too well," William said, his eyes hard, "If you ask me,this whole thing might be that woman's scheme, playing victim to turn you against Audrey!"

Blake's eyebrows shot up. "Laurel would never do that!"


"And Audrey would?" William snorted. "In three years of marriage,when has she ever done anything to hurt you?"

His voice got stronger. "She was a lively, fun girl. For you,to look good as Mr. Parker, she forced herself to become proper and dignified, taking abuse from everyone daily. Did she ever complain?"

I stood still, unable to look at either of them. The past three years flashed through my mind-the whispers at charity events, the insults from
Rebecca and Thalia, the constant judgment. I'd suffered it all silently.thinking that's what a Parker wife should do.

"If she were really selfish." William continued,"would she have kept your matriage secret for three years? Even when wanting a divorce,she only mentioned it to family, not publicly."

His gaze sharpened as he stared Blake down. "Besides, even if Audrey did this. it's because you and your Miss Rose went too far!

"This is what you owe her!"
###Chapter 75: Could It Be Astrid?
Blake's POV
My grandfather's words hung in the air, cold and heavy. The hospital room had fallen into a deafening silence. His knuckles were white around his walking stick, a testament to his mounting frustration.
I stared back at him, my jaw clenched. Audrey had been pushing every boundary lately. She had made a series of unilateral decisions about our marriage and our future, and then there was the matter of her constant association with other men. And now, this—a marriage certificate leaked online, accompanied by a narrative that painted Laurel and me as the villains of New York.
"William, Blake doesn't owe me anything."
Audrey’s voice was steady, cutting through the tension. She sat straight in her chair, though the exhaustion was evident in the faint shadows under her eyes.
"I’ve always wanted a clean break," she continued, turning her gaze toward me. "Mr. Parker, I don't know who leaked those photos, but it wasn't me. I have no interest in public spectacles."
Something about the calm, direct way she spoke made me pause. There was no flicker of guilt in her eyes.
"However," she added, "since the photos appear to have been taken inside my home, I will find out who is responsible."
Before I could respond, my phone vibrated. Laurel’s name flashed on the screen.
"I need to take this," I said to my grandfather, stepping into the hallway. My voice automatically softened the moment I answered. "Laurel, how are you feeling?"
All I heard were soft, broken sobs from the other end.
"I’ll be right there," I promised, heading straight for the elevator.
Audrey's POV
Blake's footsteps faded, leaving behind the heavy scent of his expensive cologne. William sighed, looking older than his years under the fluorescent hospital lights.
"Audrey," he said quietly. "You really didn't have anything to do with this?"
I shook my head. "I wouldn't even know it was circulating if Blake hadn't confronted me. My phone was at the repair shop all afternoon."
"Then who has access to your apartment?" William reasoned. "Could it be your friend Astrid?"
"Not Astrid," I said firmly. "She’s impulsive, but she would never sneak around. If she wanted to expose the truth, she would have done it to your face."
I frowned, mentally retracing the past few days. Suddenly, a name surfaced. James Collins. He was the only person who had been in my apartment alone recently, on the night I had collapsed.
"I think I have a lead," I told William.
He nodded. "Find the truth and set the record straight, Audrey. Whoever did this might have had good intentions for you, but the fallout is hitting everyone." He looked at the screen and huffed. "They're calling me a 'matrimonial architect.' Do I look like I have the energy to force people into marriages?"
The image of the formidable William Parker pouting over an internet comment was so absurd that I couldn't help but laugh. It was the first time I had felt a genuine spark of joy in weeks.
"I’ll miss that laugh," William said softly, his expression turning serious. "I wanted you two to reconcile, Audrey. I truly did."
"I know, William. But it's time."
"Then use this mess," he suggested, his eyes gleaming with his old strategic brilliance. "Announce the divorce officially. Make it so that stubborn grandson of mine has no choice but to let you go."
Blake's POV
Laurel looked small and fragile against the hospital pillows, the IV in her arm a stark reminder of her condition.
"Did Audrey admit to it?" she asked weakly.
I didn't answer immediately. I was looking through her recent medical chart, and something wasn't making sense. "Laurel, I thought your doctors in Europe were very clear about your diet."
She looked confused. "Yes, they were."
"Then why does this record show you've been hospitalized three times this month for complications related to... spicy food?"
Her face went a shade whiter. "I... I was just curious. I saw Audrey eating it, and I thought maybe I could too."
"Why would you compare yourself to her?" I couldn't hide my frustration. "Audrey doesn't have a compromised system. You have a serious chronic condition. This is reckless, Laurel."
She bit her lip, tears welling up. "I just wanted to be normal for a day."
I rubbed my temples, the weight of the situation pressing down on me. I had a choice to make. The company’s stock was dipping, and the public was demanding an explanation. To protect the Parker Group and Laurel's reputation, I would have to frame the divorce in a way that placed the burden on Audrey.
Just the thought of it made my chest ache. This wasn't how I imagined our end.
I looked at Laurel. She looked away, a strange, fleeting expression crossing her face—one that I couldn't quite place. "I understand," she whispered. "Just do what you have to do to save the company."

###Chapter 76: He Really Doesn't Trust Her At A

**Audrey's POV**

As I pushed through the revolving doors of the hospital,night had fallen over New York, the streetlights casting long shadows across the sidewalk.

My fingers moved automatically to my temporary phone, dialing James.The automated voice told me his phone was off.

"That's weird," I muttered, trying again with the same result.

James never turned off his phone, and being unreachable wasn't an option for a Cartier executive.


I was scrolling through my limited contacts when Astrid's red car pulled up.

"Get in," she called, pushing open the passenger door.

I slid into the leather seat. "I can't reach James."

"I know." Astrid's fingers tapped the steering wheel. "I've tried him too."

"His phone's off," I sad. "That never happens."

"What's going on?" Astrid asked, pualling into traffic. "Why would James disappear this late?"

I watched buildings blur past. "Maybe he doesn't want to face what happened."

The marriage certificate photos, the online post destroying Laurel's
reputation while tanking Parker Group's stock-it all pointed to James.

"Astrid," I turned to her. "Do you know where James lives?"

Her hands tightened on the wheel. The flash of discomfort on her face was unmistakable.


"Astrid?" I pressed when she said nothing.

The car hummed through Manhattan traffic, Astrid's silence stretching between us. Finally, she sighed.

"James lives in your neighborhood."

I blinked. "What?"

"The apartment you're renting? He recommended it to you."

"My apartment..." The words felt strange. "Was recommended by James?"

"Yes," Astrid admitted. "When I was looking for a place for you, James suggested that if you lived in the same neighborhood, you could look out for each other."


I stared at her profile, too surprised to speak.

"I was trying to play matchmaker," she added quickly. "You were miserable with Blake, and James always cared about you. I thought maybe..
." She shrugged. "I agreed."

My temples throbbed, and I pressed my fingers against them. "Why didn't you tell me?"

"He said not to. He didn't want you feeling uncomfortable or obligated."
The revelation left me quite resigned. If I hadn't asked Astrid about that today. I would never have known I unknowingly owed James this favor.

Astrid cleared her throat. "Anyway, about that online mess..."

I opened my eyes, recognizing her pivot.

"When you lost the baby and camne to Los Angeles," she continued, "I told you the best revenge against Blake and Laurel was posting your marriage certificate online."

The red light bathed us in crimson. Astrid faced me fully.


"You refused, worried about William and the family's reputation. But this morning. after Laurel's fans called you a homewrecker, someone actually did it!"


Her eyes gleamed. "You should've seen Laurel getting destroyed online today!"


I scrolled through notifications, eyebrow raised. The reaction had been swift-#LaurelTheHomewrecker trending, Parker Group's stock plummeting, celebrities weighing in.

"Who do you think posted those photos?" Astrid asked.

I glanced up. "You don't think it was me?"

"No way. I know you better." Her confidence warmed me. "If you were that ruthless, Blake wouldn't have delayed your divorce for months." She rolled her eyes. "Besides,you care too much. William's been good to you-you'd never risk hurting Parker Group just for revenge."

Her words settled over me. First William defending me, now Astrid's
Chaper

unwavering faith. The people around me trusted my character.


Except Blake.

The memory of his fingers on my throat, his eyes cold with accusation-not a second's hesitation before blaming me. A chill ran down my spine.

*That man really doesn't trust her at all.*

I sighed, watching the city blur past.

Astrid's car turned into my familiar neighborhood, but she finally pulled up outside an unfamiliar building I'd passed countless times.

"This is James's place?" I asked, though I knew the answer.

"Yep."

I stepped out of the car, instinctively glancing toward the direction of my apartment. I had no idea my rented place was so close to James's home all this time.


The doorman nodded as we entered. The elevator ride was silent. When the doors opened, James stood in the hallway holding two garbage bags,freezing at the sight of us.


"Audrey,Astrid, what are you doing here?" His voice cracked with surprise.

I stepped out, taking the garbage bags. "Astrid, could you take these out? I need to talk to James."


She rolled her eyes but took the bags. "Fine. But you owe me."

I watched the elevator doors close,waiting until the indicator showed she'd descended before turning to James.
"James," I kept my voice steady. "Did you see the news online today?"

His shoulders slumped. Without answering, he opened his apartment door."Let's talk inside."

I hesitated. Entering James's apartment felt like crossing a boundary, but discussing this in the hallway wasn't right.

I nodded and followed him in.

His decoration matched his personality-elegant without being flashy,tasteful furniture arranged to showcase the city views. Subtle Cartier artwork adorned the walls.

"Have a seat," he said. "Tea?"

I sat, watching him move to the kitchen, sighing as he filled the kettle.

"James," I said. "The photos... you really took them?"

He paused before reaching for cups. "You're here asking,so denying it wouldn't help."


"I found the marriage certificate that night when looking for your medication logs," he admitted, bringing over tea. "In your suitcase's hidden compartment."


"So you took photos of my marriage certificate without permission?"I couldn't keep the accusation from my voice.

James sighed,placing jasmine tea before me. "I was upset for you."

I sipped the warm liquid, letting it calm me.

"Since Miss Rose returned," he continued, sitting across from me, "she and
Blake flaunt theirrelationship everywhere. Everyone thinks they're the real couple."

His normally composed face darkened. "That night you were hospitalized,I saw them together, looking intimate. I was angry and took photos without thinking."

"I don't even know what was in my head at that time. Maybe," he added quietly, "I thought with this photo, I could stand up for you someday."

I gasped. "So you planned to post them online?"

James stayed silent, confirming my suspicion.

"James, I know you meant well, but you work for a public company too-did you consider what this would do to Parker Group?"

I showed him my screen, Parker Group's stock in free fall.

"This company isn't just Blake's-it's William's life work, and thousands of employees depend on it."

"Audrey." James's sharp tone made me look up. His brow furrowed.

"I admit I took the photo," he said firmly. "But the online post..."

He took a deep breath, eyes meeting mine with unexpected intensity. "Had nothing to do with me."
###Chapter 77: I'll Take Full Responsibility

**Audrey's POV**

"What? It wasn't you?" I stared at James, trying to process what he was saying.

James licked his lips nervously and pulled up a conversation on his phone."Today I saw videos of you being cornered by Laurel and Blake at Mayo Clinic."


I took the phone, my stomach tightening as I recalled the humiliating scene.


"The comments were nasty," he continued. "I checked the accounts attacking you-they're the same marketing accounts that boost Laurel's social media."


I gripped his phone tighter.

"I concluded that this whole thing was orchestrated by Laurel's team,"he explained.

"So what did you do?" I prompted, my voice steady despite the churning in my chest.


"I couldn't deletethose posts, so..." James looked away. "I contacted Laurel's PR team and threatened to expose her with your marriage certificate photos if they didn't stop the attacks."

I examined the screen carefully. The evidence was clear-James had contacted LaureI's agency with threats, but he hadn't posted anything publicly.
"You threatened her team but didn't post the photos yourself?" I asked.

"I swear I didn't," James said. "I just wanted them to stop attacking you."

I studied his face. The composed executive I knew had been replaced by someone genuinely distressed. His eyes held no deception.

*James isn't lying.*

I scrolled through his messages to Laurel's agency:

"I've tracked the negative comments about Audrey Sinclair to your team.Stop now, or I'll publish these photos and expose Laurel as the homewrecker!"


The timestamp caught my attention. James had sent his threat exactly one hour before that anonymous account went viral.

"Audrey," James said quietly, "I know I acted impulsively."

Before I could respond, the door opened and Astrid walked in. "Finally ditched that garbage," she announced, then stopped when she felt the tension. "What'd I miss?"


While James brought Astrid up to speed, I remained silent, putting the pieces together while he continued.


James watched me. "I'm sorry, but I was worried about you. Her fans are brutal online. With your health condition, I thought the cyberbullying might be too much."

"I never imagined they'd actually publish everything themselves,"he added.


But it made perfect sense. One hour after James threatened them, Laurel's
team created an anonymous account and posted our marriage certificate photos. They'd taken control of the situation.

"That's too weird, though." Astrid, who'd been quiet until now,spoke up."Laurel's PR team posted evidence that she's a homewrecker? Do they hate her or something?"

I couldn't help smiling coldly as I scrolled through #LaurelTheHomewrecker trending on social media.

"This move is designed to force Blake to choose between her and me," I explained.

Astrid looked puzzled, then her eyes widened. "Wait, what?"

"She knows Blake will take her side," I said. "That's why she's confident enough to do this."

"Holy shit!" Astrid finally got it. "She's letting herself get dragged online so Blake will think you did it? Then he'll defend her and cut ties with you?And she'll blame everything on you?"

"Exactly. When this is over, I'll be the scheming ex-wife Blake publicly despises, while she'll be the innocent victim he protects."


I pointed to specific parts of the anonymous post about William Parker forcing me to marry Blake. "Laurel has always resented William, and my marriage to Blake is still a sore spot for her. She's using this chance to smear his reputation too."

"This is outrageous!" Astrid slammed her hand on the coffee table,rattling the teacups. "What are we going to do? We can't just sit back and take this!
"
I sipped my tea calmly. "Of course not."

The old me would have retreated, accepted the villain role to keep peace.

That Audrey ded when I got my diagnosis.

I set my cup down and looked at James. "James, this siuation started with your actions..."

"Don't worry," he cut in, his eyes locked on mine. "Whatever you need,just tell me. I'll take full responsibility."

The room went quiet. His words carried more weight than this specific situation required.

Astrid cleared her throat. "Guys, I'm still here. Tone it down, would you?"

I studied James's face, noting the deep longing in his eyes. A familiar ache bloomed in my chest as I remembered how things had once been between us.


"Snow has been especially clingy lately," I reminded softly.

James's face fell instantly. He knew what I meant. My white Ragdoll cat-Blake's anniversary gift-had become a painful reminder. The night I collapsed, James let Snow escape, then told Blake I didn't want her anymore.


"Cats being clingy is good, I guess," he mumbled,avoiding my eyes.

The defeat in his voice confirmed what I already knew. Despite his promises of responsibility, some bridges couldn't be rebuilt.

I took a deep breath, rising from my seat. "Well, James, I should head back."
"If I need your help with this, I'll contact you." Before leaving, I added,"Don't act impulsively again."

James nodded, his face ashen. "I understand."

In the elevator, Astrid stayed quiet. I knew she had hoped James and I might reconnect now that my marriage was ending. But with my limited time, such complications seemed pointless.

Outside, Astrid's phone rang. After answering, she turned to me.

"Want to join my agency's team dinner?" she suggested. "The models are gorgeous! Might take your mind off things."

I shook my head. "Thanks, but my face is all over the internet right now.Being recognized would just create more drama."

"Wear a mask!" Astrid winked. "I'm an expert at flying under the radar."

Her words almost made me smile. "If I show up, your models will spend the night gossiping about me instead of enjoying themselves," I said."I don't want to be the topic-of conversation."

"Go ahead. I'll be fine getting home."

Astrid sighed. "Alright. Call if anything happens,okay?"

I waved as she drove away. The street was quiet for New York,streetlamps casting pools of light as I walked. My apartment wasn't far from James's place, so it wouldn't take long.

The fresh air cleared my head. Despite the online chaos, I felt oddly calm.Perhaps it was knowing my time was limited, or maybe external drama seemed trivial compared to my own countdown.
As I approached my building, I stopped mid-step. Blake stood leaníng against his car, smoking. Cigarette butts littered the ground-he'd been waiting awhile.

I forced my expression calm and walked straight toward the entrance,pretending not to see him.

"Audrey Sinclair."

His deep voice stopped me at the door. It lacked the anger I expected.sounding almost like a request.

"Can we talk?"
###Chapter 78:Now Do You Finally See Her Schemes?

**Blake's POV**

I could see Audrey's body stiffened. Then she turned, eyebrow raised."
What is there to talk about?"

"I told you the online posts weren't my doing," she added flatly.

As my eyes met hers, my breath caught. Something had changed in her.Before, Audrey's eyes always held a light when she looked at me - that mix of admiration and happiness I'd taken for granted. Now thatlight was gone. She looked at me like I was a stranger.

I felt control slipping away, and I hated it.

"I'm not here to accuse you," I said, pushing down the unsettling feeling. "I wanted to discuss how we might resolve this situation online."


"Then how do you want to resolve it?" she asked, face unreadable.

"This isn't the place to talk," I kept my voice steady. "Let's go upstairs."

I tried to walk past her, but Audrey stepped forward quickly,blocking my path.

"Mr. Parker," she said firmly."We can talk right here. It's not appropriate for you to enter a single woman's home."

I stopped cold. "You're single?"

"I will be soon," she replied, eyes challenging.
Fury rose in me. My family name, our reputation, billions in market value -all at risk because of this online disaster-and she casually called herself single? Like our marriage meant nothing? Like the scandal crushing my company wasn't worth her concern?

Before I could speak,she continued.

"Blake Parker, you came here to discuss our divorce, didn't you?" Her eyes locked onto mine. "Your solution is for us to divorce immediately,then forge a backdated agreement. If it's dated before Laurel returned from Europe, she wouldn't be labeled a homewrecker online, right?"

I stared at her, frowning. She knew me better than I thought. I'd barely started explaining, and she'd already mapped out my entire plan.

**Audrey's POV**

I watched Blake's face shift from anger to surprise. Despite everything, I still found myself reading his expressions - the tightening around his eyes,the shift in his jaw, the way his thumb pressed against his finger when caught off guard.


I knew I'd guessed correctly, so I said, "Drop the act. You already had this planned out. Why pretend you're here to consult me?"

"Give me the divorce agreement you've prepared," I added,extending my hand.


Blake froze, his face paling. "The divorce agreement... Michael will deliver it later."

I raised my eyebrow. He waited outside my apartment this late, but didn't bring the agreement?
"You didn't come to give me the divorce agreement? Then what are you here to discuss?"

Blake took a breath. "Audrey."

My name souanded different when he said it - softer somehow. I pushed the thought away.

"The divorce is just a temporary solution," he said, voice tired,"because what's happening online can't be fixed quickly." His eyes met mine. "Once this blows over and things calm down... We can still remarry..."

"What? Remarry? Are you kidding me?" I cut him off.

A bitter feeling spread through my chest. For months I'd tried to establish boundaries, to get him to agree to divorce. I thought he understood what I wanted.


Yet he still treated my desire for divorce like a tantrum that would pass.

It was almost funny.


I'd loved this man for years, giving him everything, yet he never understood me. Maybe he never bothered to try.


"We can discuss remarriage after we're actually divorced," I said, gathering my strength.


Blake watched me silently.

"I'll cooperate with the divorce agreement. You can go now, Mr.Parker."I walked past him without looking back and entered the building.

**Blake's POV**
I watched Audrey walk away, feeling strangely empty. She'd dismissed our marriage like it was nothing but paperwork.

My phone rang. I answered.

"Any events tonight?" I asked Alex Rhodes.

"What's this?" Alex laughed. "Is the great CEO Parker drowning his sorrows over today's internet drama?"


I stayed quiet.

"I've been telling you Audrey Sinclair is bad news! But you insisted she was innocent!" His voice was smug. "Now do you finally see her schemes?"

For years, my inner circle had talked about Audrey this way. I'd always let it slide, never feeling the need to respond.

But tonight, hearing Alex trash-talk her made me feel annoyed.

"The online situation... might genuinely have nothing to do with her," I said, surprising myself with the defense.

"Blake, be honest, is your grandfather there with you?" Alex whispered.

"What are you talking about?" I tightened my grip on the phone.


"You should use this chance to divorce Audrey quickly," he continued."Look how she's wrapped your grandfather around her finger! She has no real talents, just knows how to manipulate old men to stand up for her. It's despicable!"


My knuckles went white. I used to think Alex was honest. Now he just seemed thoughtless.
"I'll call you later," I said and hung up.

I looked up at Audrey's window. The lights were on, her shadow visible playing with her cat through the curtains.

My mood darkened.

I'd just brought up divorce, and she showed no distress. Instead, she went home to play with her cat, like she didn't care about me or our marriage.

Watching her shadow, I felt confused.

How ridiculous. I was actually anxious about divorcing Audrey Sinclair.

I sat in my car, unable to leave. This woman had probably caused the scandal costing my company billions. She'd kept our marriage secret for years.making me look foolish. She'd turned my grandfather against me.

Yet I couldn't drive away.

Hours passed. New York's nightlife buzzed around me. I answered emails and reassured shareholders while watching her window.

Eventually, her lights went out. Still, I stayed.

My phone rang at dawn. Laurel's name lit up the screen.

"Hello?" I answered, concerned she should be resting.

"Blake darling," she sobbed. "I had a nightmare. It's about Rachel's accident. I saw she was covered in blood and telling me to survive..."

"Laurel, are you alright?" I sat up straight.

"Rachel risked everything for me, and became a vegetative patient because
of it. It's only been four years... and now I have terminal cancer with little time left..." Her voice broke. "I feel so guilty about her sacrifice..."

Five years ago, when I took over Parker Group, my boldness gained the company opportunities but made me enemies.

During an assassination attempt where I was poisoned, I escaped into the ocean but collapsed on a beach.

Rachel Hayes and her sister rescued me. Through investigation,I learned her sister was Laurel Rose.


I was blind from poison; Laurel had lost her voice from shock.


She cared for me for over two months, saving my life.

Without Laurel Rose, there would be no Blake Parker today.

Her kindness was a debt I could never repay.

Thinking of this, I sighed. "Laurel, wait for me, I'll be right there."

"Alright. Blake darling, I'll wait for you."
###Chapter 79: Of Course He's a Bastard!

**Audrey's POV**

Morning light filtered through my blinds. A persistent buzzing pulled me from sleep. I fumbled for my phone, knocking over a glass of water.

"Damn it," I muttered, finally opening my eyes.

My screen showed dozens of notifications, most from Astrid. I yawned and unlocked my phone. The first message jolted me awake.

*"Audrey, things have gotten worse!"*

Below were multiple texts and links, each more urgent than the last.

*"Look at this! They're saying anything to clear Laurel of being the homewrecker!"*


I clicked the link, suddenly wide awake. My stomach dropped as the page loaded.


There on the screen was a post with my private medical records-documentation of my miscarriage.

"What the hell?" I whispered.

The post displayed a headline in bold: "TRUTH BEHIND THE PARKER
MARRIAGE SCANDAL REVEALED!"


Below was my hospital record with minimal censoring. The date of my miscarriage was cireled in red, with arrows connecting it to another date-when Laurel Rose returned from Europe.

Snow jumped onto the bed and settled beside me. I stroked her fur
absently as I read through the post:

*"These are medical records of the 'Mrs. Parker' who shared her marriage certificate yesterday. Notice she miscarried right when Ms. Rose returned from Europe."*

*"Reasonable to suspect she terminated her pregnancy deliberately, which forced Mr. Parker to publicly comfort Ms. Rose to make her jealous."*

*"This Audrey has been married to Mr. Parker for three years, finally gets pregnant, then decides to terminate? Why?"*

Below the post, the comments were vicious:

*"The paternity of the child is questionable. In wealthy families like the Parkers, children secure a woman's position. Why would she terminate unless she had something to hide?"*

*"Look at her partying at The Underground - does she look like someone who just miscarried? Maybe the medical records are fake?"*


Photos of me at The Underground appeared-sitting at the bar, talking,laughing. Now weaponized as "evidence" against me.

*"This woman is disgusting. Fakes a miscarriage, then can't control herself from dancing with men at clubs right after.."*

*"Pretty obvious she released the marriage certificate yesterday to blackmail Mr.Parker and Ms. Rose for money!"*

*"Mr. Parker should divorce her immediately. She's absolutely revolting!"*

Looking at these comments, I felt eerily clam. *Perhaps it's because I'm facing the end of my life, that I can't seem to feel much about any of this
anymore.*

My phone rang-Astrid calling. I put it on speaker.

"Audrey!" Astrid's voice crackled with anger. "Have you seen what they're saying?"

"Looking at it now," I replied, still petting Snow.

"Audrey, if these records weren't leaked by hospital staff, they must have come from someone who knew the exact date of your miscarriage," Astrid said.


I heard her pacing through the phone.

"You never like bothering people. When you miscarried, I only found out that night when you finally called me." She paused. "Besides me, who else knew the exact timing?"


"If no one else knew, I'll sue that hospital for violating patient confidentiality!" she added.

"Don't bother."

"What? Why not?"


"The day I miscarried, Blake brought Laurel to my ward. They saw me there."


"What? That jerk!" Astrid exploded. "He doesn't know your miscarriage,and even brings his mistress to the hospital? I want to punch him right now!"


I laughed despite myself. Classic Astrid.
"Enough, Astrid. There's no point getting angry over them."

A moment of silence.

"Audrey, I'm getting the feeling... you're not even angry about this?"

I pulled Snow closer. "I don't care anymore, so it doesn't matter. I'm just an ordinary person. The online abuse will fade in a few days."

"I'm not like Laurel, who depends on public opinion for her career."I contiuned,"'Since they don't want to resolve this peacefully, I don't mind if we all go down together."

*I only have less than three months left anyway. I can afford to go all in.*

We talked a while longer before hanging up. I checked my other notifications and found a message from Ethan Davies.

He'd sent screenshots from a private chat group. The first showed a conversation between an administrator and members:


*Group admin message: "The male principal has increased the budget.Keep creating content, original posts preferred. The more vicious the attacks on Ms. Sinclair, the better. I'll report upward and increase your payments!"*

Below, Ethan had written: *"I can go undercover for you."*

I frowned and typed: *"What's going on here?"*

His reply came quickly: *"My roommate sent me this freelance job opportunity - easy money, he said. We just take these talking points and post them under relevant news articles."*

*"I know you're nothing like what they're saying in the news. So I'm
staying in this group to collect evidence for when you need it."*

*"How did you get access to jobs like this?"* I wondered.

*"College student - we take whatever gigs we can find."*

That struck a chord. I knew that life all too well. Five years ago, I was in his position-taking any job that paid. Working as a server, I rescued Rachel Hayes from an aggressive classmate. We became closer than sisters after that.

We made a bet once that Rachel lost, and she had to call me "sister"and come with me to my off-campus jobs. But she kept seeing me as her sister long after the bet was over...

I took a deep breath. Rachel's disappearance was my first real experience with loss-just the beginning of what was to come.

I typed: *"Won't that affect your future opportunities in this line of work?If it would cause problems, I can handle this another way."*


A voice message came through. Ethan sounded urgent:

"Don't worry about it! It's just a part-time job. I do all kinds of side gigs.this is just one of many."


I relaxed and sent a voice message: "Alright then,collect as much evidence as you can. When this is over,I'll take you out for dinner."

His reply: *"Great! I'll look forward to that dinner!"*

**Ethan's POV**

I sat on my chair with earbuds in, barely listening to my roommate explain how to make money as an online troll. My focus was on Audrey's
voice message.

Her voice was gentle, composed, with a slight musical quality that made even simple words sound elegant.

"Who are you messaging? You're smiling like an idiot," my roommate said.

I quickly looked up, feeling my face heat up. I hadn't realized I was smiling.


"Nobody."

"Got a girlfriend?" he asked with a knowing smirk.

"Not that status yet."


"No wonder you've been hustling for side gigs lately. Trying to impress a girl. huh?" He laughed and turned back to his laptop. "But seriously, the drama in these wealthy families is nuts..."

He scrolled through news sites featuring the Blake Parker scandal.


"Don't you think this woman is hotter than Laurel Rose?" he asked,pointing to a photo of Auadrey at some event.


"Why would she mess up her cushy life as arich socialite by hooking up with someone else and getting pregnant?" he continued, reading through the comments.


"Now her husband can openly cheat, and she's getting destroyed online..."

I hesitated before carefully suggesting: "Maybe what we're seeing isn't the whole truth. Maybe... the baby was actually her husband's."

My roommate frowned. "If she was carrying her husband's child and had
a miscarriage, while her husband was out finding a mistress... that would make Blake Parker a real bastard."

Without thinking, I nodded.′′Of course he's a bastard!"
###Chapter 80: It's Because of Me Again...

**Blake's POV**

"Where would you like to go later?" I asked, sitting at Laurel's bedside with a bowl of porridge. I blew on it gently, watching her pale face against the stark white pillows.

"I want to go out for some fresh air," Laurel said weakly, barely above a whisper. The morning light on her face highlighted her fragility.

She opened her mouth as I offered her a spoonful.

"It's hot," she complained, brow furrowing.

"Is it?" I tested a drop on my hand. "Doesn't seem hot to me."

"But it feels hot in my mouth," Laurel pouted. "Try it yourself and you'll see."


"Don't be silly," I said, tapping her forehead lightly.

Our relationship was no longer that of boyfriend and girlfriend-it couldn't be. This kind of intimate yet ambiguous indirect kiss was inappropriate.especially now with all the online criticism directed at us. The last thing we needed was to add fuel to the fire.


"I was just trying to lighten the mood," she said, looking disappointed when I didn't play along. "You're so serious today, Blake darling."

"That won't happen. Just eat," I said, holding back what I really wanted to say. Her supposed illness made me cautious with my words.

At this moment, the door burst open, letting in a rush of cold air. "Blake!"
"Something's happened!" Felix Thompson stood in the doorway, face tight with urgency.

"What is it?" I frowned at the interruption.

"Felix, what's wrong with you?" Laurel looked annoyed. "Barging in and shouting this early? You scared me! This better be important."

"The online news again! William saw them! He's in the ICU!" Felix took a breath. "The doctors told me you were here."

"What happened?" My eyes sharpened instantly. A cold dread washed over me.

"Haven't you seen what's online?" Felix pulled out his phone. "Look at this."


"How is this possible..." I stared at the screen in shock.

Displayed were Audrey's private medical records - her miscarriage documentation spread across social media. The posts claimed the child wasn't mine, suggesting she terminated the pregnancy when Laurel returned. Character assassination at its worst.


Hadn't Grandfather already been upset by yesterday's news? I'd even brought Audrey to reassure him last night. And now this?

I couldn't understand how someone had accessed these records. Even I had only discovered her miscarriage by accident. I'd learned later the baby was already gone-unhealthy and unviable-which was why she made that painful choice.

The guilt hit me again. I hadn't known about her pregnancy soon enough.
I hadn't been there when she needed me. My negligence. I couldn't
swallow my pride to apologize properly. I'd asked my mother to look after her,though Rebecca never did. But I never doubted the chid was mine.Not once.

"Blake darling, what's wrong?" Laurel leaned toward me, showing concern while trying to see my phone.

I instinctively stepped back, creating distance between us, yet she caught a glimpse of the screen.

"Is this true? So Mrs. Sinclair's child... wasn't yours?" Her eyes widened as she covered her mouth.


"No wonder she wanted to terminate the pregnancy..." she sighed. "She's gentle and kind, surely wouldn't harm her child unless..."


Her tone subtly suggested negative implications about Audrey that made feel incredibly annoyed.

"Don't listen to this garbage," I cut her off, handing the phone back to Felix. "How's my grandfather?"

"Critical. He was already in the ICU when I left to find you," Felix said,voice rough with worry.

"Laurel, I need to go. The porridge has cooled- you can finish it yourself."I put the bowl down and stood up quickly.

"I'll come with you," Laurel bit her lip, starting to get out of bed.

"Stay here," Felix said coldly. "Blake should go alone. You'll just slow us down, and William's situation is urgent."

"I'll try to be quick. I care about William too, I-" Laurel's face went pale
mid-sentence. She bit her lip harder,voice quivering.

"Your 'concern' won't help." Felix interrupted. "William's condition is serious. Seeing you wouald only make things worse." He turned to me."Blake, let's go."

I cast a glance at Laurel. "Rest. I'll be back when he's stable."

Without waiting for her response, I followed Felix out and toward the elevators. My mind raced with worry for Grandfather and anger at whoever exposed Audrey's private information.

The ICU floor was quiet. As we approached, I saw Audrey standing outside the double doors, staring at the "Emergency Treatment" sign above.

"Felix, you..." She turned at our footsteps.

Her voice stopped when she saw me beside Felix. The light in her eyes vanished instantly. She frowned and looked away.

"Why is William in emergency treatment again?" she asked Felix, ignoring me completely.

"Because of what's online," Felix said grimly.

"He checked the news this morning, hoping yesterday's problems were resolved," he explained. "Instead, he saw those posts about your miscarriage. The shock was too much." He ended with a heavy sigh.

"It's because of me again..." Audrey bit her lip, hands clenching into fists at her sides.


"I've caused William enough worry before. Now, when I'm about to leave the Parker family, I've put him in the ICU again..." Her voice sounded
drained as she turned back to watch the doors.

She lowered her head, running her hands through her hair. Her shoulders slumped with guilt.

"This isn't your fault," Felix said softly. "You didn't leak that information."

"The person who should feel guilty is whoever released those records and is dragging your name through the mud," he added, giving me an accusatory look.

I didn't bother arguing but just leaned against the wall, watching Audrey.The way she avoided even glancing in my direction felt like a physical barrier between us. I loosened my tie, suddenly finding it hard to breathe.

I once wanted her to stop hovering around me all the time, hoping she would focus more on her own life. Now that she actually looked through me like I was invisible, not even bothering with a single glance, my chest hurt in a way I hadn't expected. It felt wrong, this new reality where she didn't care anymore.


The hallway fell quiet. Medical staff passed occasionally,their shoes squeaking on the polished floor. Audrey kept her focus on the ICU doors,her back to me, while Felix stood beside her like a guardian.

"Audrey." I finally broke the silence.

She didn't respond.

"I've seen the news. It's ridiculous - nothing but lies," I said,walking over and sitting in the chair next to her.

Audrey finally raised her head to look at me, letting out a cold laugh."Yes,it is ridiculous."
###Chapter 81: She Terminated Because The Baby Wasn't Yours!

**Audrey's POV**

The cold laugh that escaped my lips wouldn't stop. This whole situation was just too absurd! My mind flashed back to the message Ethan Davies had sent me just minutes ago:

*"Found something. The online attacks? Coming from 'Parker-Rose Studio.'Got confirmation from someone in their troll farm."*


Parker-Rose Studio. The name said it all. A joint venture between Blake and Laurel, created to serve their interests. So the vicious rumors claiming I'd cheated on Blake and terminated a pregnancy that wasn't his-all of it came directly from them.


I leaned against the wall outside William's emergency room, the fluorescent lights casting lights on us. Blake stood a few feet away,pretending to look concerned about the very online gossip he'd orchestrated.


When he caught me watching him, he lowered his voice. "The day you miscarried...besides the hospital staff, did anyone else know aboutit?"

The audacity nearly took my breath away.

"Why do you ask?" I kept my voice even.

"I've been investigating," he said. "Mayo Clinic has strict privacy protocols.
That surgical record shouldn't have leaked from inside."

He leaned closer. "Tell me who knew about the miscarriage. I'll help track
down whoever's spreading these rumors."

I studied his face, searching for any hint of the man I thought I'd married.Nothing.

Had this calculatig side always been there, hiding beneath the surface? I'd never caught it before.


The studio name might have told everything, yet here he stood,playing concerned husband. I wondered who his audience was supposed to be.

Blake's expression darkened at my silence, his brow furrowing with irritation. "What are you staring at? Say something!"

"You asked who knew about my miscarriage that day, besides hospital staff,"I finally said.


He nodded impatiently.

"Okay, I tell you. Only you, Mr. Parker, and your Miss Rose."

His composure slipped for just a second.

"So are you offering to investigate yourself, or Miss Rose?" I asked.

"Audrey, I'm not joking!" His voice hardened.


"Neither am I," I replied. "I didn't tell anyone about the miscarriage. Not even Astrid knew until that evening. The only people I saw at the hospital were you and Laurel."

I tilted my head slightly. "Since you're so sure it wasn't hospital staff, that leaves just you two. So who goes first in your investigation?"

The mask he always wore finally cracked. He stared at me, face paling
before anger flooded in. He turned away sharply.

"You're completely out of your mind!" he snapped.

The hallway fell silent.

I glanced sideways and noticed Felix Thompson staring at us with undisguised shock. When our eyes met. I noticed something else in his expression-a glimmer of admiration.

I smiled slightly. This was probably the first time he'd seen anyone make Blake Parker speechless. Everyone in New York's social circles thought of me as Blake's doormat-the woman who forgave everything because she loved him too much. The woman who would always choose peace over conflict, forgiveness over justice.

At that moment, the emergency room doors swung open. A doctor emerged,wiping sweat from his forehead.

"Doctor, how is he?" We all asked together.


The doctor sighed, tucking his handkerchief away. "He's stable now. But be careful with him. A man his age can't handle this kind of stress."


Relief washed through me. William would be okay.

The elevator doors opened with a soft ping, and ThaliaParker rushed out,face flushed.


"How's my grandfather?" she demanded.

The doctor frowned at her volume. "Miss, you-"

Thalia's gaze found me, and her expression transformed instantly.
"Audrey Sinclair! You bitch!" She lunged at me, hand raised.

I stepped back, but knew I couldn't move fast enough. My body,weakened from cancer and still bruised from my fall down the stairs,wouldn't respond quickly enough.

Before Thalia could reach me, Blake grabbed her wrist mid-air. At the same moment, Felix stepped between us.

"Thalia! What are you doing?" Blake's voice was sharp.

"Miss Parker, show some respect," Felix added firmly.

Thalia's eyes darted to Felix, hurt flashing across her face. "Felix? How can you take her side? I cared about you so much!"

Felix's expression remained unmoved. "Your past feelings for me aren't relevant,Miss Parker."


Rage flooded Thalia's face. She jerked violently against Blake's grip, trying to break free. "I'll kill her! I saw everything online! She didn't miscarry by accident-she terminated because the baby wasn't yours!"


Her eyes blazed at Blake. "Aren't you angry? She cheated on you!"

"She didn't!" Blake cut her off. "Everything online is just rumors. The baby was mine!"


His words hung in the air, surprising everyone. I stared at his back,genuinely confused. After creating a studio specifically to spread lies about me,why contradict his own narrative?

Thalia's mouth opened and closed. "Blake, you're still defending her? If she was carrying your child, why terminate it?"
Her voice echoed down the corridor. "Everyone knows she loves you enough to have no self-respect. If she could have your baby,she'd be happier than anyone-why would she get rid of it?"

I felt heat rising in my face. She had no idea aboutthe complications,about how the pregnancy was already failing when I discoveredit.About how I'd been alone in that hospital room while Blake was out with Laurel.

"You cheated on him," Thalia continued, glaring at me. "I'll find the best lawyers in New York to make sure you leave the Parker family with nothing!"

I was about to respond when commotion erupted from the emergency room.

"Mr. Parker! Quick,oxygen!" A nurse called urgently.

"William!" I moved toward the doors but the doctor blocked my path.

"Please wait," he said,rushing back inside.

We stood frozen, the argument forgotten as we listened to the flurry of activity within. Finally, the doctor reappeared.

"You can come in now, but stay calm," he instructed firmly. "No raised voices."


Blake turned to Thalia. "If anything happens to grandfather because of your outburst, I'll cut off your allowance."

Thalia rubbed her wrist, scowling. "If anything happens to grandfather, it's because of her, not me."

Inside, William lay with an oxygen mask covering his face, monitors
beeping steadily beside him. Despite his age, he'd always seemed indestructible to me. Seeing him vulnerable against the white sheets was jarring.

I rushed to his side and took his hand. "William, it's me, Audrey. I'm here.



His eyes opened slowly, finding mine with surprising clarity. He squeezed my hand, his other hand lifting shakily toward my face.

"Audrey," he said, voice raspy through the mask, "marrying into our Parker family... I'm so sorry. The way they've treated you is shameful."

The unexpected words caught me off guard. Of everything he could have said after regaining consciousness, this was the last thing I expected.

"William, it's not that bad, I actually-" I began.

"What does she have to complain about?" Thalia interrupted sharply from behind me.
###Chapter 82: Control Your Sister's Mouth

**Audrey's POV**

"Grandfather." Thalia planted herself at William's bedside, hands on hips. "
You can't be too partial to her. She's been cheating on Blake!"

"Thalia!" Blake snapped. "Get out."

Thalia's hand flew to her chest. "I'mn telling the truth! Why should I leave?
If anyone should go, it's this outsider!" She jabbed a finger in my direction.
"I'm your granddaughter by blood. Why should I be the one to leave?"

Thalia's words clearly made William's face flush crimson despite the oxygen mask.

His breathing turned heavy and labored, the monitors spiking. His eyes blazed with undisguised fury.

Even through the mask, his voice carried the full force of his rage:

"GET OUT!"

He struggled against the pillows, fingers tightening around mine. "I know Audrey better than anyone. She would never cheat. NEVER!"


William's defense warmed something in me. Unlike his grandson,he'd actually taken time to know who I was.

Thalia's face twisted. "Really? She's got men everywhere lately - that college friend and some university kid. Living it up while you're stuck here."

I stiffened. Something wasn't right.
I racked my brain, trying to remember when Thalia and I had last crossed paths. There hadn't been any recent encounters.

James Collins -that might be explainable. He'd attended William's birthday gala, where Thalia had seen us speaking. But Ethan Davies? In every interaction I'd had with him, Thalia hadn't been present. She shouldn't even him.

Wait, Thalia was Blake's sister, practically joined at the hip with Laurel.One of them must have told her about Ethan.

Which could only mean one thing: they were watching me. Gathering information.


Taking a deep breath, I met Thalia's eyes calmly. "I'm surprised you're so invested in my personal life."

Thalia flipped her hair. "My brother's reputation matters. If you're cheating-"


"Then tell me exactly when I met this college friend. Or when I first saw the university student."

Her mouth opened, then closed.

"My child was three months along," I continued. "What was I doing three and a half months ago? And where were these supposed lovers?"

Thalia paled. "How would I know? I'm not tracking your affairs. I just care about my brother!"

"Really?" I smiled coldly. "Then you must know where Blake was three and a half months ago?"
Instantly, her face paled, her mouth opening, yet she failed to say anything.

"Can't answer?" I straightened in my chair. "Let me help you."


The room went quiet.

"Three and a half months ago, Blake was in Long Island during that big storm. He caught a fever and called me. I took a boat through rough waters to reach him and stayed for a week."

I kept my voice level,factual.

"I didn't bring contraceptives. That's when I got pregnant."

I met her eyes. "Want to see the boat tickets and receipts from the island?"

William's breathing steadied as he watched her falter. Through his mask,he let out a satisfied snort.

"Told you she wasn't that kind of person," he rasped.

"L..." Thalia trailed off,biting her lip.

Her eyes flickered nervously toward Felix, who was watching her with unmistakable disappointment. I caught that glance-her desperate need for his approval.

Not wanting to lose face, Thalia doubled down. "So what? Maybe you slept with the boat captain or someone else there..."

The slap echoed through the room.

Blake had struck his sister across the face.

"You've gone too far," he growled.
Thalia touched her reddening cheek, stunned silent as tears formed.

"Audrey is your sister-in-law," Blake towered over her. "She's taken care of you for years. Apologize. Now."

"You hit me?" Thalia's voice cracked. "For her?"

"Apologize!" Blake demanded.

"Why should I?" Thalia's voice rose: "Even if the baby was yours, she's still hanging around that college guy and the student. You've seen it!"

I watched her meltdown with detachment.

"Besides," Thalia switched tactics, "she skipped the divorce court. She doesn't want to leave - she just wants to be between you and Laurel!"

"Why should I apologize to a homewrecker?"

"What? Homewrecker?" Felix laughed.


He looked at Thalia, shocked by her words. "Are you suggesting Blake and Laurel are the legitimate couple while his legal wife is the intruder?"


"The unwanted person is the third wheel," Thalia snapped. "And she's unwanted!"


Blake pulled out his phone. "Michael, come get Thalia."

Michael's voice immediately went through,"Got it,sir."

"Blake!" Thalia protested. "Everything I'm saying is true! She's a homewrecker-"


Michael appeared with two guards who escorted her out. Her face was a
mix of shock and outrage as the door closed behind them.

Silence filled the room. William's breathing steadied while Felix lingered by the door.

Blake ran a hand through his hair - a rare sign of stress from him.

"Thalia's young," he said. "I apologize."

I laughed. "She's older than me."

"I don't need your apology," I met his eyes. "But control your sister."

I lowered my voice. "I have evidence of all the messes I've cleaned up for her."


"I hear she wants to break into Hollywood," I added. "Wonder how her career would fare if those things went public?"

**Blake's POV**

"You've helped Thalia?" I couldn't hide my shock.


William snorted, pulling off his oxygen mask. "You don't know your own sister?"


He sat up straighter. "Haven't you noticed she stopped bringing you her problems after your coma?"

I looked between him and Audrey, confused.

"Not because she grew up," William continued. "Because she knew you'd scold her, so she went to Audrey instead."

He gestured toward her. "Why do you think Audrey charged thousands to
your card? What did you think that money was for?"


I froze.

I'd always assumed Thalia had matured during mny coma. And I'd believed Audrey spent freely because she loved luxury.

Had Audrey been quietly fixing my sister's problems all this time?

"If that's true," Felix pushed off from the doorframe, "Audrey got screwed."


He shook his head. "From how Thalia just acted, I'd have sworn they were enemies. Yet Audrey's been cleaning up after her for years."

He smirked. "Is Audrey too nice, or is your sister just ungrateful?"

I ignored the mockery in his voice as I turned to Audrey, my mind racing.
"We need to talk. Outside."

She didn't move, still holding William's hand. "Mr. Parker."

Her gaze was steady. "Whatever you need to say,say it here."
###Chapter 83:We'll Have Children Again

**Blake's POV**

I rarely saw Audrey this cold, this distant. The woman standing before me in William's hospital room was practically a stranger, her eyes devoid of the warmth they once held for me.

I felt myself freeze for a moment, anger flashing through me before I could suppress it. "I just want to talk about Thalia outside!"

*After all we've been through as husband and wife,is she really this guarded around me?*

Audrey glanced between William and Felix, her smile barely there. "If it's about Thalia, you can speak freely. No strangers here."

Her casual dismissal felt like a deliberate provocation. Felix wasn't a Parker,but he'd grown up with me and was Thalia's childhood friend. Years ago,Thalia had even pursued him, and when I was too busy to handle my business, Felix had often offered to help. Felix knew exactly what Thalia was like; there was no need for discretion around him.


Still, her words made my brow furrow deeply.

"Just say what you need to say," Audrey continued, looking directly at me,her tone calm but distant.The challenge in her eyes was unmistakable.

Noticing my hesitation, grandfather snorted from his hospital bed. "What's the secrecy for? We're all family."

Felix chuckled awkwardly, glancing between us. "Blake, do you need me to step out?"
With things having reached this point. I couldn't insist any further. I felt my shoulders tense slightly. "No, just stay."

I glanced at Audrey, feeling a storm of emotions I couldIn't quite name."It's nothing much. I just wanted to ask you how many problems you've solved for Thalia over the years, and how much money you've spent."

Audrey raised an eyebrow. "Too many to count." She met my gaze directly."As for money-whatever was charged to your black card went to her problems."

I felt myself freeze, disbelief washing over me. "The card I gave you...you used it to spend on her?"

"What else?" Audrey laughed coldly, her voice tinged with sarcasm and resignation.

She continued, "I helped your sister solve her problems, but did you expect me to pay for them too?"


"You know I grew up in a small town. Even after my biological parents found me when I was eighteen, they never really took care of me. I don't have money of my own." As she spoke, Audrey's eyes grew distant,though her tone remained surprisingly calm.

I frowned, feeling a flash of guilt. "That's not what I meant."

*For the past two years, Rebecca and Thalia had constantly complained to me about Audrey being greedy, using my black card to buy luxury goods and jewelry. I had always assumed... that she had used the money to maintain appearances. I never imagined...*

"Then what did you mean?" Grandfather glared at me from his bed."Audrey's done enough for this famnily. We've failed her, not the other way
around!"

"I..." I tried to explain but was interrupted before I could finish.

"Mr. Parker," A nurse appeared at the door, her tone professional but urgent. "You're stable now. We need the ICU for critical patients."

The nurse's reminder made us all suddenly realize we were still in the ICU.

Audrey quickly stood up and apologized to the nurse, her face showing genuine remorse. "I'm so sorry, we'll leave right away."

Back in the ward, the air felt suffocatingly silent. Grandfather tapped his fingers against the blanket, his disapproval radiating toward me.

Felix stood up, glancing at Audrey with a light smile, trying to ease the tension. "Audrey, have you had breakfast yet?"

"I'm going to get Mr. Parker some food. Want to join me?"

Audrey nodded quickly, obviously eager to escape the oppressive environment. "Sure."

"Wait." Just as the two reached the door, I spoke coldly, my voice carrying an undeniable command. "Felix, stay and keep my grandfather company."

I stood up, feeling my height advantage as I moved to Audrey's side,almost physically blocking her path. "I'll go with her."

Felix paused, instinctively glancing at Audrey, his expression awkward."Well..."


Audrey frowned slightly as she looked at me. After brief consideration,she finally nodded. "Felix, please stay. I actually have something to discuss with him."
With that, she strode out of the hospital room, her figure resolute and stubborn. I followed closely behind.

**Audrey's POV**

The elevator closed, trapping Blake and me inside.

Despite the space, I couldn't breathe normally. My pulse quickened.


*His cedar scent filled the air between us.*

Fortunately, the elevator doors soon opened again.

This time, a large family entered. At the center of the group was a new mother in a wheelchair, holding an infant in her arms. Her face was rosy,her smile radiant.

The family occupied most of the elevator space, their cheerful voices filling the entire elevator.


Almost instinctively, Blake turned toward me, shielding me from the crowd. His movement was natural and protective, like a habit formed over years.


We stood face to face, our posture intimate, our breaths mingling. I could feel the rise and fall of Blake's chest as he breathed, and smell his familiar scent.


Face to face, I noticed his jawline, the movement of his Adam's apple as he breathed. I felt another flutter in my heart, my heartbeat accelerating beyond my control.

*Even now, he fits everything I find attractive.*

"Honey, you've been so strong," the new father in the elevator spoke up as
he looked at his wife. "Seeing you in surgery nearly killed me."

"I felt terrible putting you through childbirth," he continued, touching her shoulder gently.

The new mother laughed at his words, her face radiating happiness. "It hurt, but I don't regret it. I wanted your child because you love me so much."


As she said, she was gently caressing the infant in her arms.

"Three years married and still so in love," one relative laughed. "Some couples have all the luck."

Protected by Blake's body, I listened, my fingers clutching my clothes.

*Three years married, like us. They have joy, love, and a child. We only have divorce papers and a miscarriage.*

I glanced up to find Blake watching me. His brow furrowed slightly,his eyes seemingly containing restraint and pain.

*He's thinking about our lost baby too.*

Soon, the elevator reached the first floor.

The family left amid laughter and chatter, their joyful voices gradually fading.


Only Blake and I remained in the elevator, the air filled with an indescribable emotion.


Blake stood in front of me, maintaining his protective stance. His eyes focused intently on me, as if trying to see through to my very soul.
After a long moment, he finally spoke, his voice hoarse and slightly trembling: "Audrey."

"We'll... have children again."
###Chapter 84: We're Still Young

**Audrey's POV**

I froze, staring at Blake, unable to believe my ears. The family who had just left the elevator with their newborn had taken their happiness with them,but somehow left behind these unexpected words hanging between us.

Was I hearing things? Blake Parker - the man who spent three years treating me like a stranger, who'd been joined at the hip with Laurel Rose since her return - talking about future children?

Blake noticed my shock. His brow furrowed, something flickering behind his eyes - perhaps he just realized how crazy those words were.

"Forget what I said," he muttered, straightening his tie before turning toward the open doors.

I snapped back to reality just as the elevator began to close. I slipped through the gap and followed him down the corridor.


We walked in silence from the elevator toward the hospital entrance. Blake moved with his usual confidence, shoulders squared, each step purposeful.I followed a few steps behind, watching him.

I observed his tall figure, once so captivating to me. An involuntary coldness touched my lips. I'd figured out why he'd said those words.

That family we'd shared the ride with - the tender looks between new parents, their whispered words of mutual support through childbirth. The scene had created ripples in my heart, and apparently, it had moved something in Blake too.
If he'd been a responsible husband all along, such words might have meant something. But our child - from existence to nonexistence-never commanded his attention. Even the day I miscarried,he was with Laurel.

He'd remembered my terminated pregnancy and wanted to imitate them by saying something reassuring to me. A normal sentiment,perhaps. If Blake had been a responsible husband, such words would have been appropriate, even comforting.

But this child,from existence to nonexistence, Blake had never paid attention to it. Even on the day I miscarried, he was still being cozy with his Miss Rose.


What right did he have to say such things now?

Soon,we sat down at a small restaurant across from the hospital. Just a family-run breakfast spot with mismatched tables and the smell of fresh soy milk. Not Blake's usual five-star scene, but it was close to William's room.


A server handed Blake the menu with a smile. He took it and passed it to me-pure habit from countless dinners where I'd order for both of us while he chose wine.


This time, I didn't take it.

I kept my eyes on my phone, checking messages from Astrid and Ethan."Three orders of soy milk and fried dough with one tea egg," I said flatly."One for here,two to go."

Blake's hand stoppèd mid-air, menu suspended between us.

"What about mine?" His voice held genuine surprise.
I glanced up. "You can't order for yourself?"

Without waiting for his response, I checked my phone. Ethan had sent a voice message.

"Audrey. I've done something big for you. What are you going to treat me to?" His voice carried the enthusiasm of youth.

I started to reply: "That depends on what you want to eat, I..."

"Server," Blake called out, louder than necessary. "I'll have what she's having."

I frowned at him. He knew exactly what he was doing. Looking down,I realized my half-finished message had already sent.

Ethan replied immediately: "Audrey, I heard that!"

"Is that your husband?"

"Is he giving you trouble? Need me to come help?"

As I started typing, Blake spoke up, "Let him come. Didn't he ask you to treat him to a meal? Soy milk and fried dough would be perfect for him."

"Real mature," I said, typing back: *No need, thanks for your concern.*

I placed my phone face-down, hoping that would end it. But the sudden ringtone made me jump. Ethan calling. I moved to decline when Blake's hand shot out and grabbed my phone. I tried to keep it, but his grip was stronger.

In one smooth motion, he answered and hit speaker.

"Audrey, where are you?" Ethan's voice filledI our space. "I'm coming to
find you. Your husband's clearly hassling you again."

"I-"he started.

"Young man," Blake cut in smoothly. The CEO voice,cool and controlled.

"Do I need to remind you that Audrey and I aren't divorced yet?"

After a pause, Ethan replied, "You will be soon enough."

"Actually, Audrey and I were just discussing having another child." Blake's voice was casual but firm. "Our relationship is fine. Whether we divorce is between us as husband and wife. It doesn't concern outsiders."


"I..." Ethan's voice faltered.

"Young man," Blake continued, his tone dropping. "As men, I know what you're thinking. But remember - don't fixate ón things that aren't yours.Don't pursue people who aren't available to you."

Even through the phone, I could feel Ethan's discomfort. Blake had that effect on people - making them feel small without raising his voice.

He ended the call with a tap, leaving silence between us.

My temple throbbed. I snatched my phone back. "What gives you the right to answer my calls?" I kept my voice low but sharp. "And when did I discuss having another child with you?"

"Just now in the elevator," he replied simply.

I laughed coldly. "That's ridiculous. We're getting divorced."

"The divorce is temporary - just to protect Laurel during this media storm,"Blake said, like he was explaining something obvious. "After things calm
down, we'll remarry."

I stared at him, stunned by his presumption.

"Don't worry," he said, his voice softening. "We're still young. We have plenty of time. We'll have children eventually."

His words - "we're still young, we have plenty of time" - cut deeper than he could know. Yes, I was young. But time wasn't on my side. Three months left with terminal cancer meant no future children, no future anything.

"I don't need children anymore," I said firmly.

Our food arrived. I ate mechanically, tasting nothing,avoiding further conversation.


Across the table. Blake watched me. eyes narrowed,brow furrowed. He was trying to understand this new version of me that didn't fit his expectations - the version that no longer bent to his will.


After eating, we left together. I carried the takeout containers for William and Felix as we walked back to the hospital in silence.

It wasn't until we entered the elevator to William's room that I looked up at Blake."Mr. Parker."


He turned at the formal address.


"You kept Felix from coming with me, saying you needed to talk. Was it just to mention having children?"

I knew Blake too well. If he had something important to say and missed his chance, he'd create another opportunity to get me alone. With my
limited time, I couldn't afford to play his games.

So I had decided to ask while we were still in the elevator, in this small window of privacy before we rejoined William and Felix.

Hearing my words, Blake frowned, sarcastically pulling at his lips as he looked at me. "What do you think I wanted to tell you?"
###Chapter 85: I'll Personally Be There to Give You My Blessing

**Audrey's POV**

Seeing Blake's lips curved with that familiar hint of mockery, eyes watching me like I was some puzzle he enjoyed not solving

I frowned and turned away, fixing, my eyes on the elevator numbers instead of his face.

"If you don't want to say it, forget it. Next time, don't make excuses about needing to talk."

The elevator went quiet. From the corner of my eye,I caught Blake's eyes narrowing. His presence filled the small space until I could barely breathe.

I focused on the floor numbers. Fourteen... fifteen... sixteen. My nails dug into my palms. Despite everything, his proximity still affected me.

When the doors opened, I stepped out first,eager to escape.

"Audrey Sinclair."

I stopped but didn't turn. "What?"

Silence stretched behind me. I could feel him studying my back. The antiseptic smell mixed with the scent of breakfast I'd bought for William and Felix.


I started walking when he finally spoke, his voice oddly quiet.

"Michael will bring the divorce agreement this afternoon. If there's no problem, sign it, and we'll go to court tomorrow."
I paused. After trying for so long, the divorce was finally happening. And now,for Laurel's sake, Blake - who'd been furious when I missed our previous appointment - was pushing for it.

Even in divorce, he acted for another woman. What had I ever seen in him?


"Fine. I won't miss it."

I continued toward William's room. The food felt heavier than it should have.


"One more thing."

I stopped again.

"In three days at the Four Seasons Hotel, there will be a... ceremony."

I frowned at his hesitation.

"You know what ceremony it is,don't you?"

I turned around. Three days, Four Seasons Hotel... exactly what Thalia and Olivia had mentioned - the venue Blake had booked to propose to Laurel. And he was asking if I knew?

"I know," I said coldly. "What about it?"


Blake relaxed slightly. "Even though we're getting divorced,I hope you'll attend." His tone was oddly formal. "Make sure you're on time."

His eyes swept over my simple blouse and slacks. "Wear something nice."

I stared at him. Was he crazy? He was planning to propose to Laurel and wanted his soon-to-be ex-wife there in formal attire?
What was going through his head? Did he think we'd be friends after divorce, or was this just another way to humiliate me?

Blake shifted under my stare. He frowned, walked past me, and headed toward William's room.

I watched him, my emotions a mess. The man I once thought hung the moon was a stranger now. Yet the familiar set of his shoulders still sent a pang through my chest.

*Focus,Audrey. This doesn't matter.* I shook my head and followed.

As we approached William's room, his voice drifted into the hallway.Blake slowed, and I instinctively did the same.


"After those two divorce, they'll go separate ways," William was saying."Felix, I can see you have feelings for Audrey. Your situation isn't bad - if you pursue her, you might have a decent chance."

I nearly dropped the bags. What were they talking about?

"Mr. Parker, you... don't mind if I pursue Audrey?" Felix sounded surprised.


"Why would I mind? That's between you two," William replied. "We can't keep binding her to our family with a past marriage and stop her from finding someone new just because they're divorced."

A pause. "Besides... Blake is the one who wronged Audrey,carrying on with that Laurel Rose. What right does our family have to keep her from finding someone new?"

Warmth spread through my chest as I gripped the bags tighter. Even though I had no intention of dating after divorce -how could I, with only
three months left? - William's support meant something.

Blake's face darkened as he noticed my reaction.

"Well,since you put it that way..." Felix continued, sounding eager,"I guess I really will make a move on Mrs. Park - " He caught himself."I mean,Audrey."

"That's fine," William laughed. "You're reliable. I'd feel at ease if Audrey was with you. But these things depend on chemistry. Don't force it."

His voice softened. "But if you two do end up together, I'Il personally be there to give you my blessing at the wedding!"

"For your blessing, I'll have to try mny best..."

Before I could process this, Blake shoved the door open hard enough to bang against the wall. He stood there, fury radiating from his tall frame as he glared at Felix.

"Should I also offer my congratulations?" His voice was ice.

**Blake's POV**

The shock on Felix's face was obvious. His smile froze as he glanced awkwardly between me and Audrey.

"Blake, I... I was just joking," he stammered.

Grandfather snorted, looking at me. "If you don't treasure Audrey,someone else will! You're divorcing her - why do you care who pursues her?"


He turned to Felix, his expression softening. "I like Felix. He's just back from Europe and hasn't built his career yet, but at least his personal life is
clean - unlike some people who worship the woman who abandoned them!



The same old argument. The same accusations against Laurel.

"Grandfather, you misunderstand Laurel," I tried to keep my voice even. "She-"

"I don't want to hear that name!" He cut me off. "Don't mention her to me!



I closed my mouth. Out of respect, I stopped arguing. But frustration burned under my skin.


The room fell silent.

After a moment, Grandfather sighed and looked at Audrey. "When I first encouraged you to marry into our family, it was because I genuinely liked you and wanted you to become part of us."

His voice carried regret. "I never thought... But Felix is a good kid too. If you could be with him..."-


"William." Audrey's soft voice stopped him.


She moved past me, her shoulder brushing mine. Her face softened into a smile I rarely saw directed at me anymore.

"What are you saying?" she asked gently. "I don't need á partner to live.Please don't try to arrange things for me."

She handed breakfast to Grandfather and Felix, then set up the small table on the bed.


"Besides, even if I get divorced and am no longer a Parker, I'll still be your
granddaughter." Her hands worked efficiently, arranging containers of congee, dumplings,and frui. "And I'll still visit you like before."

"Good,good," Grandfather laughed, patting her hand. "Then I won't meddle. But you must keep your word - even after divorce, visit your grandfather often!"

"Of course," she promised, her voice warm. "Even before I was married,I always came to see you..."

I stood in the doorway, watching her coax Grandfather to eat. The light in his eyes, the ease in his shoulders - a transformation I rarely achieved.

The sight stirred something uncomfortable in me. These past months,because of Laurel, Grandfather and I had been at odds. Yet Audrey,without effort, could pull him from anger to laughter.

What did she have that made him so fond of her? When had she learned to handle him with such ease? Had she always been this way, and I'd simply never noticed?

My phone vibrated. Laurel's name lit up the screen. I glanced at Audrey,focused on helping Grandfather eat, her slender fingers adjusting his napkin, her voice gentle as she urged him to try the dumplings.

The phone kept vibrating. After a moment of hesitation, I answered.

"Yes, I'm coming," I said flatly, my eyes still on Audrey.

I turned and walked out, carrying the image of Audrey's gentle smile with me.
###Chapter 86: I Don't Want Any Ties with BdeParker After Divorce

**Audrey's POV**

When William finished breakfast, I gathered the plates and turned toward the trash bin by the door. That's when I noticed Blake was gone.I couldn't remember hearing him leave.

"He left after taking a call." Felix noticed and spoke up, wiping his mouth with a napkin. "I couldn't hear what it was about, but I think it was Laurel Rose again."

"Oh." I tossed the trash away, face blank.

I'd just wondered when he'd disappeared. As for why or for whom, I didn't care.


William snorted as he adjusted his pillows. "That boy has been completely bewitched by that woman!"


"By the way," William added, lowering his voice, "I heard that brat mention last tíme that Laurel Rose got sick while she was in Europe."

He pointed at Felix. "Help me find out what ilIness she actually has!"


Felix raised an eyebrow. "So you're saying Blake might be good to Laurel because she's sick?"


I busied myself straightening William's blankets, avoiding the conversation.

"What illness? It's all an excuse!" William huffed. "Looking at Laurel Rose with her rosy complexion and strong voice, even if she is sick, it's nothing serious."
He waved dismissively. "What, does she have terminal cancer or something?"

My body trembled at the words "terminal cancer." Then I forced my hands steady, smoothing William's blankets.

"These sheets are a mess," I said, focusing on the task.

Felix seemed to see my reaction, his eyes narrowing as he glanced between William and me.


I pretended not to notice and gathered the remaining breakfast items.

After making sure William was comfortable and promising to visit again,Felix and I walked out together. The elevator doors closed behind us with a soft hiss.


"Just now..." Felix began, frowning.

I kept my eyes on the changing floor numbers.


"When William was talking about Laurel being sick, I noticed you seemed off," he said, tilting his head. "What's wrong? Are you...sick?"

I froze momentarily, then shook my head.""No."

"Then you-"


"You're mistaken," I cut him off. "I didn't notice anything wrong with myself."

"So... I really was mistaken?"

"Yes," I pressed the lobby button again.
The elevator hummed around us. I needed to change the subject.


"Mr. Thompson," I said.

Felix looked relieved. "What is it?"

I took a deep breath. "Those things you said earlier to William..."

I met his eyes. "Tll just assume you were joking."


Confusion crossed his face.

"After the divorce, besides William, I don't want any connection with people close to Blake Parker," I said firmly. "I hope you understand."

Understanding dawned, followed by disappointment. His lips curved into a bitter smile.


"Can't you give me a chance?" he asked softly. "I'm not Blake..."


I looked up, my smile cold. "Could you, for my sake, make sure your family has no business dealings with Blake Parker?"


Felix opened his mouth, then closed it. His silence was answer enough.


Blake Parker ran Parker Group - basically New York's business equivalent of royalty.You couldn't make it in Manhattan without crossing paths with him eventually. The Thompsons and Parkers went way back, with Felix's family scoring major deals thanks to that connection for years. No way Felix could promise to avoid Blake. His family would never allow it.

"Since you can't," I continued, "if I accepted you, I'd inevitably have to see Blake Parker sooner or later."

The elevator continued its descent.
"First, it would affect your family's business relationship with him," I explained. "Second... I don't want any ties with Blake Parker after the divorce. It's best if we never see each other again."

My tone softened slightly. "I hope you understand."

The elevator reached the lobby. "I'll be going now," I said, offering a slight smile.


I stepped out with purposeful strides, but instantly froze when I saw what awaited me. The lobby was packed with reporters surrounding Blake and Laurel at the center. Laurel clung to Blake's arm, her face animated as she spoke. Blake stood behind her, looking at her with tenderness I hadn't seen in years.


"Blake is a wonderful person," Laurel said, her voice carrying across the space. "Perhaps some people don't understand his goodness and end up hurting him. I feel so sorry for him."


The reporters nodded sympathetically. One called out, "Miss Rose,regarding the online rumors that Mr. Parker is deliberately showing affection to you because his wife cheated during their marriage, what's your take?"


Another added, "Miss Rose, do you think Mr. Parker's feelings for you are genuine, or is he just trying to spite his wife on the marriage certificate?"

I couldn't look away from the scene unfolding before me. Without thinking,I pulled out my phone and hit record.

Laurel's face took on a sad expression. "Blake darling and I have known each other for five years. Although we were apart for tree years, I believe our connection is something no one can come between."
She glanced back at Blake, blushing. "In the future, Blake darling and I will always be good friends!"

The reporters laughed knowingly. "Just friends or boyfriend and girlfriend?" someone teased.

Laurel's blush deepened. "We're just good friends for now. Please don't misrepresent us!"

"We understand!" a reporter called out. "Before Mr. Parker divorces that ungrateful woman, you're just friends, right?"

Laurel glared at him. "Don't make things up in your reports. If it affects Blake darling's divorce property settlement, I won't forgive you."

The reporter grinned. "Don't worry, Miss Rose, we all understand!"

Felix emerged behind me, taking in the scene. "Looks like Laurel Rose has been giving these reporters plenty of favors," he said coldly. "It's clearly a case of a homewrecker, but they're making it seem like Laurel is Blake's rightful wife."

I didn't respond, and only then did Felix notice my action, his eyes widening. "Audrey, why are you recording this?"


I stopped recording once I had enough footage and uploaded it to my cloud storage. "Keeping a memento," I said calmly. "Don't you think it's quite entertaining?"


Felix stared at me like I'd grown a second head.

Let him be confused. The proper Mrs. Parker who endured every slight with dignity no longer existed. Cancer had killed her before it would claim my body.
As I put my phone away, a commotion erupted from the press pool.

"Wait, who's that?" a reporter pointed in our direction.

Another's eyes widened. "Isn't that the woman on Mr. Parker's marriage certificate?"

"It really is her!"

The reporters turned toward us like sharks smelling blood, abandoning Laurel and Blake. Cameras swiveled, microphones extended, and they charged in our direction.


"Miss Sinclair, why did you cheat during your marriage, betraying Mr.Parker by getting pregnant with someone else's child and secretly terminating it?"

I stepped back, bumping against the elevator doors.

"Miss Sinclair, today Miss Rose was hospitalized and Mr. Parker came to discharge her. Why are you here? Is your jealousy driving you to stalk them?"


The questions kept coming.

"Miss Sinclair, what do you say to accusations that three years ago, you disregarded Mr. Parker's wishes and inappropriately married him while he was in a coma?"


"Miss Sinclair, seeing Mr. Parker with Miss Rose, do you feel guilty? Will you choose to divorce and let them be happy, or will you shamelessly cling to Mr. Parker and break them up?"
###Chapter 87: Why Did I Terminate This Pr egnancy?

**Audrey's POV**

Microphones jutted toward my face like accusing fingers, cameras trained on me with predatory focus. Every question carried undisguised hostility.

Felix Thompson stood beside me, his eyes narrowing with each question hurled my way. I could feel the anger radiating from him as the questions grew more invasive. The Thompson family, like the Parkers, lived by a code of public dignity that made direct confrontation unseemly. But I saw something in Felix snap.

"Do you people understand what professional journalism is supposed to look like?" His voice was tight with controlled anger.

The reporters' attention swiveled toward him.

"Sir, what exactly is your relationship with Miss Sinclair?" A male reporter adjusted his glasses, camera crew quickly repositioning.

"You're awfully quick to defend her," another called out. "Could you perhaps be the man she cheated with? Was the baby she terminated yours?



"If you could just clarify - " The reporter pressed forward.

"This gentleman is Felix Thompson, heir to Thompson Group,who returned to New York just last week," I interrupted. "Are you absolutely certain you want to point your cameras at him and make these accusations?
The effect was immediate. Recognition dawned across their faces, followed by panic.

"Oh! Mr. Thompson!" The reporter laughed awkwardly. "We had no idea you were back!"

"The baby Miss Sinclair terminated was conceived over four months ago-obviously nothing to do with Mr. Thompson!"

"A misunderstanding, completely!"

"Miss Sinclair, please respond to our earlier questions!" The reporters redirected their attention to me.

Before I could respond, my gaze drifted past them to wvhere Blake and Laurel stood near the hospital entrance. Laurel clung to Blake as if she couldn't stand without him, one hand clutching his arm while the other rested against her chest. Blake held her close, murmuring something in her ear.


Something in Blake's posture changed when he felt my gaze. He straightened, creating just enough space between himself and Laurel to be noticeable. His eyes lifted, seeking mine across the distance.

I looked away. Looking back now would serve no purpose.

"Miss Sinclair, our viewers deserve to know the truth about your terminated pregnancy!"

The reporters clearly expected me to break down or lash out. Instead, I pulled out my phone and opened the camera app.

"What exactly do you think you're doing?"one asked.
"My memory isn't what it used to be. With so many faces and questions, I thought it best to keep a record," I said. "Just in case anyone misrepresents today's interview."

I handed my phone to Felix. "Would you mind helping me with this?"

Felix positioned himself to record, satisfaction evident as the reporters shifted uncomfortably.

"Now, regarding your questions... I'm ready to respond."

"You've claimed I cheated during my marriage and terminated another man's child," I said directly. "What evidence supports these claims?"

The reporters exchanged uneasy glances, their aggression deflating.

After conferring among themselves, they regrouped and pressed forward.

"If you didn't cheat, then why terminate your pregnancy without telling Mr. Parker?" One reporter persisted.

"Yes, if it wasn't another man's child, why end the pregnancy?"

"After three years of marriage, with your first child on the way-why terminate it?"


"Why did I terminate this pregnancy?" I repeated.

I took a breath, gathering my thoughts. "Because when I discovered I was pregnant, I had already decided to divorce Mr. Parker."

The reporters fell silent.

"Blake and I had experienced a breakdown in our relationship over a month ago and were finalizing our divorce agreement," I continued.
"After signing preliminary papers, I discovered I was three months pregnant. Knowing this child would be born into a fractured home,without the blessing of an intact family, I made the difficult decision to terminate."

I paused briefly. "At that point, Mr. Parker had firmly decided on divorce.He hadn't returned to our home in weeks, had shown no interest in my wellbeing. He had no knowledge of my pregnancy."

"I acknowledge that deciding to terminate without informing him showed a certain disrespect to Mr. Parker," I conceded. "However,this outcome was ultimately best for everyone involved - for me, for Mr. Parker, and for Mr. Parker's current partner."

"Are there any other questions about the pregnancy?"

The reporters seemed at a loss. My explanation had undermined their scandalous narrative.


**Blake's POV**


From a distance, I watched Audrey handle the reporters with unexpected composure. She wasn't falling apart under pressure as I'd anticipated.Instead, she articulated our situation with unsettling clarity,referencing the backdlata ed divorce agreement we'd discussed with a conviction that sounded genuine.


She looked so damn confident. Not a hint of deception in her voice or expression. Just someone stating plain facts.

A chill ran through me. This wasn't how it was supposed to go. The divorce papers were just a stopgap - something to handle the PR nightmare until things cooled down and we could quietly reconcile.But
Audrey was talking about our split like she'd already moved on.

The worst part? Almost everything she said was true. The fake divorce agreement was the only lie. I really hadn't been home. Hadn't called.Hadn't checked on her once. Hadn't known she was pregnant.

Hell, if I hadn't gone with Laurel to that doctor's appointment, I wouldn't even have known about the miscarriage.

The realization constricted my chest. I had my reasons-Laurel had returned from Europe with what she claimed was a terminal diagnosis.She needed my support, my protection.

But watching Auadrey stand alone against this barrage, I found those justifications suddenly ringing hollow. What kind of husband had I become?


"Blake darling..." Laurel's voice cut through my thoughts. "Did you really decide to divorce Miss Sinclair over a month ago?"


All eyes shifted to us. Trapped under public scrutiny with cameras recording my every reaction, I could only offer a stiff nod. "Yes."


Laurel's expression transformed, her eyes brightening. "I remember - it was precisely a month ago that I contacted you about returning to New York!"


I felt something cold settle in my stomach.

"So, Blake darling..." Her voice lilted upward. "After learning I was coming back, you immediately decided to end things with Miss Sinclair? You stopped going home,stopped seeing her completely?"

Before I could respond, Laurel threw herself into my arms.
"I knew you still cared for me all this time!" she cried. loud enough for everyone to hear.

The reporters' reaction was immediate.

"Mr. Parker and Miss Rose make such a perfect couple-truly meant for
each other!"

"Finding out Miss Rose was returning from Europe, Mr. Parker ended his arranged marriage a month early to prepare for her -now that's a love story for the ages!"


"Seeing Mr. Parker and Miss Rose together restores my faith in true love!"
###Chapter 88: Our Own Family Business
Audrey's POV
I watched the reporters swarm around Laurel and Blake again. A heavy sigh escaped me as I turned to Felix, who was still holding my phone.
"Alright, that’s enough," I said, taking my phone back. "Thanks, Mr. Thompson. Astrid and I will treat you to dinner sometime to pay you back for the help."
Despite the chaos erupting around us, I felt oddly composed. It was as if the louder the world became, the quieter it grew inside my head.
Felix looked at me, our eyes meeting briefly. I offered him a radiant smile—one born of genuine relief. He seemed momentarily entranced, standing rooted to the spot as I prepared to walk away from the spectacle.
"Miss Sinclair! Please wait." Laurel’s voice called out, sweet but with a distinct, sharp edge beneath the surface.
I stopped and glanced back, keeping my expression carefully neutral. "Miss Rose, do you need something from me?"
"Of course I do." Laurel let go of Blake’s arm and walked over, the reporters trailing behind her like ducklings following a mother hen. She linked her arm through mine—a friendly gesture for the cameras, but I could feel her fingers digging into my skin.
"Miss Sinclair," she said, her voice raised for the microphones. "I understand that when you married Blake three years ago, you had your reasons. And I appreciate that you’ve looked after him in my absence."
I remained silent, waiting for the inevitable blow.
"But since you signed those divorce papers over a month ago, and now that these... unfortunate private records have been leaked online," she continued, her smile never faltering, "to avoid any further misunderstandings, why not settle this today? The reporters are here, the court is open. Let’s make the divorce official so everyone can move on. Don’t you agree?"
The reporters surged forward instantly, their questions hitting like hail. "Yes! An official end to the rumors!" "Will you finalize it on camera?" "You aren't having second thoughts, are you, Miss Sinclair?"
Every comment felt coordinated, a pincer movement designed to corner me. I looked at Blake. I could see the tension around his eyes, a flicker of something unsettled behind his usual mask of CEO stoicism.
Before the media could spiral further, Blake stepped through the crowd, positioning himself as a barrier between us and the flashing bulbs.
"Enough," he said, his voice low but carrying an undeniable authority. "You only need to know that Audrey and I decided to part ways long ago. When we choose to file the final paperwork is our family business. Outsiders have no say in the matter."
The corridor went silent. The reporters lowered their cameras, some even backing away. No one dared to challenge the man who controlled the Parker Group.
I noticed Laurel frowning, trying to catch the eye of certain reporters she had clearly briefed. But even her allies wouldn't risk Blake’s direct wrath. I smiled slightly and pulled my arm from Laurel’s grasp.
"Mr. Parker," I said clearly, my voice ringing out in the silence. "I think Miss Rose and the reporters have a point. Finalizing the certificate today would put an end to all this speculation. I’ve said it before: I only want what is mine. I have no interest in the Parker Group’s assets."
I curled my lips into a small smile. "Let’s go to court. With your influence, speeding up the administrative process shouldn't be a problem, right?"
Blake's POV
My body went rigid. I turned, stunned to see her calm, smiling face. This wasn't the reaction I expected.
"Since the decision was made over a month ago," she added evenly, "and now that Miss Rose is back, dragging this out isn't good for anyone. Is it, Blake?"
Then she turned and walked toward the exit, her steps light, as if a massive weight had just been lifted from her shoulders.
I stood frozen, watching her leave. My chest tightened painfully. During our marriage, Audrey had mentioned divorce during our rare, heated arguments, but I had always dismissed it as a tactic to get my attention. She had always eventually apologized, saying she was just being petty.
But this time was different. She wasn't backing down. She wasn't looking for an apology. She was walking away like she actually meant it.
A sense of helplessness washed over me. This couldn't be happening like this—so publicly, so final.
Laurel grabbed my arm, practically bouncing with a suppressed excitement. "Blake, darling, let’s go! We shouldn't keep Audrey waiting!"
As we headed outside, I saw Audrey getting into Felix Thompson’s sports car. My stomach tightened. She wouldn't even ride with me to her own divorce?
As my car pulled away, Laurel watched Felix’s car merge into traffic. "Miss Sinclair and Mr. Thompson seem very close," she mused. "She seems to get along with every man she meets. Unlike me... after all these years, you’re still my only true friend, Blake."
I closed my eyes, leaning back against the leather. "If you want, you could make more friends, Laurel."
"I don't want that," she whispered, leaning against my arm. "I’d be afraid you’d get jealous."
Behind my closed eyes, a memory of Audrey surfaced—from the early days, when she still looked at me with warmth.
"Using someone else to make your partner jealous is insecure and cruel," she had said once. "If I ever get close to another man, it's because I've truly moved on, Blake. I'd never do it just to hurt you."
When had that warmth disappeared? Had I been so focused on Laurel’s return that I hadn't noticed the light in my wife's eyes fading out?
"Blake, darling?" Laurel’s voice broke my thoughts. "You're distracted again." She pouted, clinging to my arm. "I asked if you'd be jealous if I had male friends everywhere like she does."
I looked at her, then back at the road where Felix's car had vanished. "No," I said, the word feeling heavier than it should. "I wouldn't."

###Chapter 89: I've Never Had Any Regrets

**Audrey's POV**

Felix's car cut through midtown traffic. I scrolled through the latest headlines about me on my phone, each nastier than the last.

"Audrey, are you,.. really sure about this?" Felix asked, gripping the wheel tight. "Once you do this with all these reporters watching... there's no going back."

"Why do I need going back?" I looked up. "Without Blake Parker,am I suddenly helpless?"

Felix backpedaled. "That's not what I-"

"Save it." I cut him off, locking my phone screen and staring at the road ahead. "I know what people in your circle say. That how I've been desperately clinging to Blake. Using divorce threats as leverage."

Through the window, Manhattan blurred by. Headlines flashed in my mind: *Parker Wife's Lâtest Tantrum. CEO's Desperate Spouse Seeks Spotlight*.

"But that's over now," I said. "His thing with Laurel is out in the open.No more pretending."

I spoke with a calm that surprised even me. Like I was discussing some celebrity gossip instead of my own marriage falling apart.

Felix watched me for a moment, then gave a half-smile. "Should I be saying congrats on your fresh start?"

I glanced down at my phone. "Not a fresh start. Just clarity."
At a red light. I took screenshots of the worst articles. One called me unstable. Another claimed I faked pregnancies to blackmail Blake.

"What's with that?" Felix nodded at my screen.

"Evidence," I said without looking up. "Just like the hospital video. No matter how much these reporters were paid to smear me... there should be consequences for defamation, don't you think?"

Felix's eyes lingered on my profile. I could feel his gaze,studying me with an intensity that should have been uncomfortable but somehow wasn't.

"Blake will regret this," he said.

The certainty in his tone made me pause. Like he was stating a simple fact,not offering empty comfort. I slightly shook my head without answering.

The light changed. We drove on.

Cameras flashed as we pulled up to the courthouse. Reporters packed the steps like vultures waiting for a meal.

"Ready?" Felix asked.

"As I'll ever be."

The moment I stepped out, chaos hit. Voices shouted my name. Michael Chen, Blake's assistant, carved a path with security guards.

"Mrs. Parker, this way." His voice was flat, allbusiness.

*Mrs. Parker*. Soon just Rebecca's title. The thought felt good.

Standing at the bottom of the courthouse steps, I took in the spectacle before me. How strange that my marriage to Blake had begun and
continued in sllence, with many peopp H  有E had been secretly married for three years. Yet its ending was so spectacularly pubiic.
It seemed as if our divorce   anticipating, as if the entire city ha this moment. When we married, only William and Charles Wright were present. Now at our divorce, the spectacle was overwhelming.

A quiet beginning,a silent middle, and a deafening end. Perfect symmetry.


My phone buzzed, William's name appeared with a simple message:

"*Audrey, you'll always be my granddaughter.*"

Seven words. My walls cracked. I blinked back tears, caught off guard by my own reaction.

William hurt more about this divorce than Blake or I did.Yet he offered his blessing because he understood my pain better than anyone.


William had been morefamily to me than my biological parents who found me at eighteen after a hospital mix-up left me raised in a small town. Even as I left his grandson, he still claimed me.

"You okay?" Felix's voice pulled me back.

I nodded, throat tight. The moment passed. Walls back up.

Blake's sedan arrived. He stepped out first, tall and commanding. Laurel followed in a white dress, holding his arm like she might float away without it.

Blake spotted me immediately. He noticed something on my face and
walked straight over, ignoring Laurel completely.

"Second thoughts?" His voice was low.

I kept my eyes fixed past his shoulder. "Second thoughts? I've never had any regrets. Let's go."

Blake studied me, about to move.

"Blake darling!" Laurel rushed up, voice calibrated to sound private while carrying to nearby mics. "Should I come with you? I'm worried someone might take advantage..."


Blake removed her hand from his arm. "Wait outside. This is between Audrey and me."


Laurel's lips trembled on cue, tears appearing right on schedule. "But Blake darling..."


I turned around, fed up with her act. "Since Miss Rose is so invested in watching,she might as well join us. With three people going in for a divorce, we can skip the explanation part."


Whispers rippled through the crowd. Laurel's eyes narrowed before she rearranged her face into hurt innocence.


While Blake talked to Michael, Laurel moved in close. Her perfume hit me first - expensive and too much of it.


"The unwanted person is the real homewrecker," she whispered.

I laughed. "So I'm the shameful intruder while you two are the real couple?
"

She snorted,smug.
"Then maybe we shouldn't get divorced," I said. "Since you're so comfortablein your position."

I turned away. Laurel grabbed my arm, fingers digging in.

"Don't you dare!" Real panic replaced her smugness.

Her mask dropped completely, revealing cold determination. "We've come this far. Blake's already reserved the venue and ordered the cake for our proposal. Don't ruin this."

"Who's really causing problems here?" I kept my voice low. "I know you're behind everything online."


Her eyes widened slightly.

"Blake and I could have divorced quietly, and you two could have started clean. Instead, you took it public."

I leaned closer. "Blake feels sorry for you and won't let me expose you,but actions have consequences."

Something dark flashed across her face. I yanked my arm away hard enough to make her stumble backward in her heels.

But instead of Blake's arms, she found herself caught by Felix Thompson.

The moment Laurel realized who had caught her, she jumped away as if shae'd been shocked, putting deliberate distance betweén them. Felix's expression didn't change-he'd expected this reaction. He stood casually between Laurel and Blake, arms crossed over his chest.

"Laurel," he said casually, "this is someone else's divorce. We should stay out of it."
His eyes held a knowing look. "Not every show is worth watching."

The tension between them felt loaded. There was history there. Felix winked at me-I got this.


I walked past them to Blake's side.

"Let's go, Mr. Parker. Let's finish this quickly."

At the courthouse doors, Blake grabbed my wrist. His touch felt warm.

"Audrey, you..." His voice trailed off.


Irritation flashed through me. After all this time, now he wants to talk?

"Something else?" I asked.

Blake's eyes searched mine, looking for something.

"No," he said finally.

"Then let's go now." I pulled away and walked through the doors,not checking if he followed.
###Chapter 90: I Don't Recall Agreeing to Raerry

**Blake's POV**

I stood frozen outside the courthouse. Audrey had already gone through the doors, walking with confidence I rarely saw in her. This divorce was just temporary- a strategic move to protect Parker Group and keep Laurel from being called a homewrecker.


So why couldn't I move?

"Blake darling, I won't come in with you," Laurel said, her hand touching my arm. "Go handle the divorce yourself." She smiled. "I'll wait right here!"

I nodded, finally snapping out of it. Divorce was my plan to fix things.But now that I was here, I felt unsettled. Audrey seemed more decisive than me.


Just now, I wanted to ask if she understood this was temporary,with remarriage later. Or was she taking this literally?

But I couldn't bring myself to ask. I'd been CEO too long to show uncertainty. If I revealed doubt now, it would look like weakness - like I cared too much.


A strange regret spread through me. If I let go now, I might never get her back.


I pushed the thought away. This would hurt Audrey more than me. She had more to lose. Even if I didn't mention remarriage, she'd eventually come crawling back. She always did.
"T'll be back soon," I told Laurel before walking through the doors.

Inside, the courthouse buzzed with activity. People noticed us immediately.stepping aside to clear a path as I walked across the marble floor toward Audrey at the counter.

A clerk rushed over. "Mr. Parker, we can process you right away."

They led us to a private room with paperwork ready. The clerk glanced between us nervously.

"We have your documents ready, but there seems to be some confusion about which version to use."


I hadn't planned on being here today, and Michael's carefully drafted agreement was nowhere to be seen。


Audrey pulled papers from her purse. "Use this version."

I looked at her draft - simple and ridiculously generous to me.She'd walk away with nothing buat her clothes and that white cat. No property, no shares,nothing from three years of marriage.

The clerk frowned. "Miss Sinclair, are you certain you don't want anything else? By law, you're entitled to half of Mr. Parker's marital assets."

Audrey's lips curved slightly. "Money I didn't earn doesn't belong to me."

"If she doesn't want it, don't worry about it," I told the clerk coldly.

Audrey signed her namne on the divorce form without hesitation. I watched her signature finalize our marriage's end before adding mine.

Minutes later, the clerk handed us each a divorce certificate. Our marriage certificates were marked void.
Audrey took a deep breath looking at her certificate, like someone who'd finally put down a heavy load.


I ignored the odd feeling that thought gave me. She must be walking away with nothing because she knew we'd remarry. After everything was fixed,she'd be Mrs. Parker again, making today's asset division meaningless.

She put the certificate in her purse like it was precious and headed for the exit.


I followed her. Before she could leave, I stepped closer, keeping my voice low.


"Take care of yourself. About remarriage, once I handle everything..."


Audrey turned with a look of surprise. "Remarriage?"

Her tone knocked me off balance.

"Blake Parker, who said I would remarry you?"

"Didn't we agree -"I started.

"I don't recall agreeing to remarry," she cut in, her eyes suddenly cold."I said we'd discuss it after the divorce."

She stepped back. "Now that we're divorced, I'll be clear: I won't remarry you."


My eyes widened. "What?" Anger surged through me. I grabbed her wrist hard.

Pain flashed across her face asshe said, "Don't act like I deceived you.I was vague about remarriage because I didn't want problems. You mentioned it, but I never agreed."
She met my eyes despite her pain. "Even if I had toldI you I wouldn't remarry you, would that have stopped you from divoreing me? You needed to help Laurel save face and keep her from being labeled a homewrecker. Did you have a better plan?"

Something in her gaze- maybe the total absence of love that once lived there- made me loosen my grip.

She pulled away, creating distance between us. Seeing her defensive stance,I smiled bitterly.


"If you don't want to remarry, why walk away with nothing?" I asked.

Hadn't she always valued my money? Wasn't that why she married me?

"I told you," she said simply, "money I didn't earn isn't mine. I won't take it."


She straightened her shoulders. "Mr. Parker, we have no connection anymore. May our paths never cross again."

With that, she walked quiekly toward the exit.

I stood stll, holding my divorce certificate. Her steps seemed lighter now,like she'd been freed. My chest felt hollow, like I'd lost something important.

**Audrey's POV**

Reporters swarmed me the moment I stepped outside. Cameras flashed as microphones pushed toward my face.

"Miss Sinclair, why didn't Mr. Parker come out with you?"

"Did you really get divorced? Can we see the certificate?"
"How many Parker Group shares did you receive?"

"What are your plans now?"

I glanced at the reporters. There were more than at the hospital earlier,but the ones asking cutting questions were the same few with ties to Laurel.

I held up my divorce certificate. "My marriage to Blake Parker has ended.
No further comment."

I headed toward Felix's car across the street.

The reporters followed, shouting questions, but I felt strangely calm. For the first time in years, I was just Audrey Sinclair again. Not defined by Blake or the Parkers.


Just me- with three months to live, but free.

I stopped suddenly and turned around. "As of today, I'm no longer Mrs.Parker. Don't trouble an ordinary person with your gossip."

"About your online defamation, I'll be filing lawsuits," I announced."
Those who orchestrated it behind the scenes won't escape either."

I looked directly at Laurel standing at the back of the crowd. She stared back with contempt, practically mocking me.

I met her gaze briefly before walking away toward Felix,who waited by his car.


He quickly moved to open the passenger door. The normally flamboyant Thompson heir seemed moe like my assistant today.

"I'm in a good mood," I said as I approached.
"I can see that," he replied.

I eyed his car. "Trust me with your car?"

Felix paused, then smiled. "Why wouldn'tI?"


Without hesitation, he handed me his keys and took the passenger seat.


I tied my hair into a ponytail and settled behind the wheel. The engine growled to life as I pulled away with'a perfect turn, accelerating quickly -leaving behind Blake, Laurel, and three years of a marriage that never really existed.


For the first time in years, I felt free.
###Chapter 91: Free At Last, I Could Die Happy

**Blake's POV**

I stood outside the courthouse while conversations buzzed around me.

"Did you see how she handled that car? Total pro."

"The ex-Mrs. Parker isn't what I expected."

"Clean divorce, no drama. Just signed and bounced."

"She must have a free spirit! Nothing like the desperate gold-digger from the tabloids."


I kept my face blank as I watched Audrey drive off in Felix Thompson's sports car like she'd owned it her whole life. These comments painted someone I barely recognized.

*Free spirit?*

Had Audrey wanted freedom from me all along? Had our marriage been her prison?

None of it made sense. She married me while I was in a coma. She spent my money. Multiple people told me she'd admitted marrying mne for wealth and status.

So why did our three-year marriage suddenly feel like something she needed to escape?

The way she slid behind that wheel, the calm in her eyes when she handed me those divorce papers-who was this woman?

"Blake darling!"
Laurel's hand grabbed my arm before I saw her. She blocked my view of the street, resting her head against my arm. Her perfume hit me like a wall.

"Thalia just texted," she chirped. "She wants us to meet her and Olivia tonight to celebrate. Are you free?"

"What is there to celebrate?" The words came out sharp.

My humiliation or the fact that Audrey had walked away without looking back when I was certain she'd come crawling to me?

**Audrey's POV**

The sports car engine roared as I took another lap around New York's outer ring road. Felix sat quietly beside me while I enjoyed what I needed most-speed and control.

The afternoon sun warmed my face as I gripped the wheel. Every turn was my choice. Every acceleration my decision. No Parker family telling me what to do.


I pulled over at an oceandlookout and opened the top. The salt air hit my lungs, and something unexpected washed over me - pure joy.

I'd thought ending my marriage would crush me. After loving Blake for five years, three as his wife, I'd prepared for grief and regret. Maybe even the urge to beg for another chance.

Instead, I felt like I could breathe again. No more Parker name weighing me down. No more playing perfect society wife. No more judgment from Rebecca and Thalia, No more Blake's coldness.

Today, I just felt free,
"You look happy," Felix said.

I turned to find him watching me. When was the last time someone looked at me like I mattered?

"Is there something on my face?" I asked.

"Actually, yes," Felix said, totally serious.

I touched my cheek. "What? Did I get ink on myself from the divorce papers?"

Felix laughed. "No. It's the look of someone who just broke free."

I laughed - really laughed. "You're right. Dumping a miserable marriage does wonders for your mood."

"If it was so bad, why'd you marry Blake Parker?"

The question didn't hurt like it should have. "Temporary insanity," I said."Blinded by love."

I couldn't tell him everything - how I'd cared for Blake when he was blind five years ago. His promises to find me. How crushing it was when he woke from his coma with no memory of me, devoted to Laurel instead.

Some secrets were mine alone, especially now that I was free.

I pulled my divorce certificate from my pocket. Audrey Sinclair again, not
Parker. I held it up against the sky and ocean for a photo.

I posted it on Instagram: **Free at last. I could die happy now.**

A sportscar roared up beside us, its red paint job gleaming in the sun.
Astrid pushed up her sunglasses. "To celebrate your divorce, I borrowed this ridiculous car. Flashy enough?"

I laughed and pocketed my phone. "Perfect!",

"Astrid's here for me," I told Felix. "I'll head back with her. I owe you dinner for all your help today."

Felix froze. "You two planned this?"

"Obviously," Astrid grinned. "We coordinated."

She slid to the passenger side. "Mr. Thompson, I noticed how you looked after Audrey today. We'll thank you properly another time."

I got behind the wheel and put on Astrid's sunglasses. "Dinner soon."

"Why not today?" Felix suggested.

Astrid studied him like she'd evaluate a new model. "Can't. You're busy."

"Am I?"

"Blake rented The Underground tonight," she said. "He's invited everyone to celebrate his divorce. Can you miss that?"

Felix tensed, glancing at me. I kept my face blank - like Blake wasn't my husband of three years who'd just divorced me.

"So?" Astrid pressed. "Dinner tonight? Or are you going to Blake's party?"

Felix sighed, "We should reschedule,"

"That's more like it," Astrid smirked. "Your friendship with Blake trumps everything!"
"Bye, Felix!" I waved casually.

I drove away, leaving Felix- and the Parker world -behind.

"Avoid that one," Astrid said, eyeing Felix in the mirror. "He spent the whole day at your side - hospital, courthouse, everything. Then Blake's party comes up, and suddenly dinner's off. His loyalty's clear."

I kept my eyes on the road. "I know. I already told him nothing would happen between us."

At a red light. I glanced at Astrid. "I won't make the same mistake twice with trust fund boys who put business first."

Astrid slouched in her seat. "Thank God. I worried you'd fall for another rich charmer."


"Nope," I said. "Felix is fine, but not my type."

**Felix's POV**

I watched the car shrink to a red dot before disappearing around the bend.
With a deep sigh, I moved to the driver's seat of my own car.

My phone buzzed constantly. I checked the group chat that had exploded since Audrey and Blake signed their divorce papers:

*"Audrey's threatened divorce before but always crawled back. Is she serious now?"*

*"She'll beg to reconcile soon. Just bigger drama this time."*

*"Blake should ditch her for good and marry Laurel!"*

*"Betting $5,000 she begs Blake to take her back within a month!"*
*"$10,000 says two weeks max!"*

I stared at these messages before typing: *"$50,000 says she won't try to get back with Blae."*

The chat went silent. Nobody had suggested Audrey wouldn't return.

Then Blake wrote: *"$100,000 says she'll beg to get back together within a week."*


The chat exploded:

*"Totally agree, back together in a week!"*

*"Going from luxury to normal life is tough. She'll come running in days!"*

*"Wonder how she'll save face when she crawls back..."*

I pictured Audrey handling my car, and the genuine freedom in her smile when talking about leaving her marriage.

*"None of you know her. Why so sure she'll beg to reconcile?"* I typed.

Everyone ignored me and kept speculating.

Then Blake replied directly: *"Are you saying you know her well?"*

The chat went dead silent while private messages flooded in:

*"Lost your mind? They're divorced!"*

*"Trying to piss off Blake Parker? Want to tank your family business?"*

My stomach dropped. The Thompsons had worked with Parkers for generations, and I couldn't risk my family's business relationships with Parker Group.
After a long moment. I wrote: *"I don't know her either.Just thinking out loud.Ignore me."*

I looked at the ocean and whispered. "Audrey... I'm sorry."
###Chapter 92: What Are You Doing Here?

**Audrey's POV**

Wind whipped through my hair as I pushed the red sports car around the coastal road. Astrid and I drove for hours,stopping occasionally at overlooks before finally heading back to Manhattan as darkness fell.

The restaurant Astrid chose was tucked in a quiet corner of the Upper East Side -elegant but not showy, with soft lighting and privacy.

"If I didn't have to drive this borrowed car back tonight,I'd definitely have a proper drink with you," Astrid said, watching me as she poured our tea."You have no idea how upset I've been seeing all that crap online about you lately."

"Being in the modeling industry, I know exactly how brutal online trolls can be." Her fingers tightened around her cup. "I was terrified that all this negativity would be too much for you to handle."

"But instead of letting the internet drama crush you, you actually used it to your advantage and finally divorced Blake!" Her eyes lit up. "I still can't believe you did it with all those cameras rolling."

I took a sip, and smiled, "I guess something good came from all this mess after all."


"Even though you've divorced Blake, people are still attacking you online,"Astrid frowned. "Want me to get my agency's PR team to handle it? They're experts at cleaning up messes."

"Don't bother. Let them keep talking." I met her gaze directly. "If they stop now, there won't be enough recent evidence when I collect everything
for my lawsuit."

Astrid's eyes widened before her face split into a grin. She waved to the server. "Your best bottle of red!"

Then she leaned forward. "Yout're really suing those trolls?"

"T've spent years holding back for the sake of being Mrs. Parker.They all thought I was born to be pushed around." I straightened my shoulders."
Now that I'm divorced, I don't need to save anyone's face anymore."

The server returned with wine, pouring a glass for Astrid.

"Audrey, I'm so happy!" Astrid's eyes suddenly glistened. "You're really...back!"


I watched her take a big sip of wine. "I thought you weren't drinking?"

"Can't help it!" She grinned. "Besides, you can't drink anyway because of your health, so you can drive when we return the car. My boss only said I had to return it personally - never specified I had to drive it."

As she continued drinking, her emotions became more pronounced.

"After Rachel disappeared,you were the only close friend I had left, but you got so wrapped up in Blake, that jerk." She took another drink. "For him, you quit racing, stopped designing jewelry, quit having fun..."

"Watching you change for that man, putting up with his family's crap..."She set her glass down firmly. "It killed me, and I felt so useless - I couldn't protect Rachel, couldn't help you..."

Her teary eyes met mine. "When you came after your miscarriage saying you were done with him, I didn't believe it. I thought you'd go back and
break my heart all over again. Now you're finally free, and I can breathe!"

My chest tightened. I'd never realized how my marriage had affected her too.


"Anyway, from today on, there's no more MMrs. Parker - just my friend Audrey Sinclair!" she declared, raising her glass. "We'll look after each other, and when we retire, we'll travel everywhere together!"

The future she imagined - retirement, travel, years of friendship - was something I couldn't promise her.

"Why wait until then?" I asked, looking away. "Do you have time soon?Let's go traveling now."


Astrid set her glass down, surprised. "No need to rush. I've got a major runway show coming up and need to train the junior models. I won't have free time for at least a month or two... After the show, I'll take some time off and we can really enjoy ourselves!"

I sighed quietly. *I probably won't live long enough for 'someday.*

"Fine, I'll wait for you," I lied.

By the time we left, Astrid was thoroughly drunk, leaning against me as we reached her family's home.

Mrs. Wilson opened the door, concern on her face. Two staff members waited behind her.

"Mom!" Astrid waved, nearly falling, "Look who I brought!"

Mrs. Wilson's eyes moved from her daughter to me. "So drunk!"

Her face softened, "She must have been celebrating your divorce today."
"Yes, she's happy for me."

The staff helped Astrid inside. Mrs. Wilson took my hand. "Audrey.Congratulations on your freedom."


Her simple words caught me off guard - genuine, understanding what this divorce truly meant.

"Thank you, Mrs. Wilson," I smiled.

"Audrey..." Astrid called from the stairs. "Don't forget the car..."

Even drunk, she remembered her responsibilities.

"Don't worry!" I called back.

Back in the car, I messaged the owner as instructed. The response came immediately - a location pin.

I stared at it, frowning. The Underground.

Blake rented that club tonight to celebrate our divorce. The car owner was probably among his guests.

I hesitated, finger hovering over the ignition. I didn't want to encounter anyone connected to Blake or have people know I went near his divorce party.


But I can't let Astrid down. If I'm quick - drop off the car and leave immediately - I might not even run into any Parkers.

Decision made, I started the car and headed toward The Underground.

The neon lights of The Underground cast a blue glow across the sidewalk as I parked. Music pulsed from within, muffled by the doors but still
vibrating through the pavement.

I texted:*"I've arrived."*

The response came quickly: *"Wait a moment, I'll be right out."*

*"Okay."*

I got out, keys in hand, and waited. The club doors swung open,and three women emerged.


Before I could turn away, a familiar voice called out: "Well, look who it is!"

*Thalia Parker*. Blake's sister and my most vocal critic.

"What a coincidence," she added.

"Who is it?" asked Olivia, her ever-present sidekick.


"I don't recognize her," said Laurel Rose, her voice measured. "If Thalia knows her, let's say hello."


My back stiffened. I took a deep breath before turning to face them.

"Quite a coincidence indeed," I said with a forced smile.

Olivia's eyes widened. "Audrey Sinclair!? What are you doing here?"

"She's here to ruin everyone's good time," Thalia crossed her arms. "She must have found out Blake rented this place to celebraté, so she came to spoil everything."

I stayed silent,letting her continue.

"I suggest you leave before my brother sees you," she warned."He's in a great mood tonight and drinking more than usual. If you ruin his night...
I won't let you get away with it!"

Three years ago, those words would have intimidated me. Three years of Parker disapproval had taught me to back down, apologize, make myself smaller.


Not anymore.

I crossed my arms and met her gaze coldly. "You and your brother may have rented The Underground, but did you also buy the sidewalk outside?"

I stepped forward. "Have you forgotten that I'm no longer part of the Parker family?"

Looking directly into her shocked eyes, I added, "Your threats...mean nothing to me now."
###Chapter 93: Don't Flatter Yourself

**Audrey's POV**

"You -!" Thalia's face contorted with rage as she took a step toward me."Since you're not a Parker anymore, I'm sure Grandfather won't protect you like before!"


Under the neon lights of The Underground, her face looked almost demonic with fury.


"Without our family, what are you, Audrey Sinclair? Who are you?" She practically spat my name, her eyes wild. "If we want to crush you, it'll be as simple as crushing an ant!"

"Then I'll wait for Miss Parker to crush me," I replied calmly, leaning against the borrowed sports car.

Suddenly something occurred to me as I raised an eyebrow. "Oh, by the way,since Miss Parker is so eager to come after me, should I perhaps release everything I have on you before you make your move?"

Thalia instantly paled.

I continued, counting elegantly on my fingers while looking down.'"For example, getting trapped at that casino in Atlantic City, being mistaken for an escort when caught with that college boy in that hotel, or being scammed out of six figures in that online dating scheme...".

I glanced up to find Thalia frozen in place, "You wouldn't dare!" she hissed,her voice barely audible.

Over these three years, whenever Thalia got into trouble and was too afraid to face Blake, she would call me to handle it. Each time, I not only
resolved everything discreetly but also helped conceal it from others.Gradually, Thalia developed a habit. No matter what kind of trouble she encountered, she would seek me out. Unlike her mother and brother who would scold her. I would always come with a'smile,ready to help.

She never imagined I remembered everything and kept proof. WVith her plans to break into Hollywood, exposure would make her a laughingstock in New York society.


"Why wouldn't I dare?" I asked.

Thalia glared but stayed silent, her confidence gone.

Laurel gently raised her eyes and smiled at me, stepping forward slightly."Miss Sinclair." Her voice was soft but carried clearly in the night air. "You didn't come here just to argue with Thalia, did you?"

While speaking, she adopted the air of tonight's hostess, her posture shifting subtly. "Since you've come uninvited, is there something important you need to handle?"


I raised an eyebrow, about to respond, when a commotion erupted from the direction of the club entrance.


**Blake's POV**


"That car is a limited global edition. Only my dealership has it in New York," Alexander explained as we left The Underground.

The night air felt cool after the club's heat. Several friends followed us out,listening in.

"If Wilson hadn't called about her model needing a car and promised its return, I wouldn't have loaned it out," he continued. "Despite our
friendship and all your business, I'm still reluctant to sell you this particular model."

I raised an eyebrow. "If you're so reluictant, why loan it at all?"

"That's different!" Alexander frowned. "Wilson considers us close friends.She mentioned the borrower is a gorgeous single model, and you know P've been single for years..."

He rubbed his hands together. "Plus, she's a racing expert who might táke me racing! Such a spirited woman - lending my car seems worth it. She loves cars and won't damage it!"

I frowned. "Since you've decided to sell it to me, you shouldn't be lending it to other..."


My words stopped as I spotted a woman by a red sports car across the street.

*Audrey?*

*Why is she here?*

I froze, unable to process the sight. Alexander and the others followed my gaze. Alexander looked stunned before turning to me.

"Blake, you think she regrets divorcing you already?" he asked quietly.

I narrowed my eyes, studying Audrey's composed stance.

The group started whispering.

"Must be it. Everyone knows Blake rented this place to celebrate his divorce."
"Coming here specifically -she must want to reconcile."

"We said she'd regret it within a week. Couldn't even last half a day!"

"The Parkers spoiled her too much, making her forget her place."

I knew it. She couldn't let go. Whether she missed the Parker wealth or missed me personally. Her regret was enough.

My lips curled upward as I walked toward her, the others following.

As we approached, I noticed Laurel, Thalia, and Olivia standing with her-invisible earlier in the dim lighting.

"I'm here because I have my own business," Audrey's voice carried through the night.

Thalia snorted. "What business? You obviously regret divorcing my brother!".


She gestured wildly. "You threatened divorce at Grandfather's party,escalated it online, dragged Laurel into it, then went through with it. Now you're crawling back the same day. How pathetic!"

Audrey gave her a cold look. "Thalia Parker, is what I have on you not threatening enough?"

Thalia paled. She turned away, avoiding Audrey's eyes. "That's all you can do -threaten me. But if you expose anything, don't ever think about entering the Parker household again!"

"Nothing would please me more," Audrey laughed.

Thalia bit her lip, silenced.
Laurel frowned at Olivia. "Perhaps I shouldn't have asked you both out for air... If not for me, we wouldn't have caught Miss Sinclair trying to reconcile with Blake, Now she's embarrassed and lashing out.."

"What are you saying?" Olivia looked anxious. "Her groveling isn't our problem. If we hadn't caught her, someone else would!"

She turned to Audrey with a cold laugh. "If you knew it would end like this,why start it? You could have stayed Mrs. Parker. Why divorce only to humiliate yourself?"

Audrey looked down, fidgeting with car keys, waiting for Olivia to finish.Then she looked up calmly.

"Finished?" she asked.

Olivia glared, struggling to find more insualts.

Audrey straightened. "My turn. Do you think every woman is like you,unable to survive without wealth and power?" She shook her head."Divorcing Blake Parker was my choice. I didn't want him anymore. I left him."


Her gaze swept across everyone present before settling on a point somewhere behind me. "Having separated from him completely, I would never go back to reconcile with him in this lifetime."

I stopped cold, fury flashing through me.

Alexander looked awkward,glancing between us.

The area fell silent. No one behind me dared breathe.

I stared at Audrey intensely, my gaze drilling through her.
"Just because Blake rented this club doesn't mean everyone inside belongs to him," Audrey continued. She snorted. "I came to meet someone for my own business, not your precious MIr. Parker. Don't flatter yourself!"

With that, Audrey took out her phone to find the car owner's number and pressed the call button.


A phone ringtone suddenly broke through the silent night air.
###Chapter 94: What a Beautiful Car!

**Blake's POV**

Thalia noticed me first, her eyes widening before she nudged Laurel.

"Blake darling!" She abandoned my sister and cousin, rushing to my side and grabbing my arm. "When did you get here?"

I didn't answer, my attention fixed on Audrey. She stood perfectly still,her gaze shifting between Alex and me, confusion evident in her expression.
Had she come here looking for me?

Thalia didn't waste the opportunity to twist the knife. "Still claiming you're not here to reconcile with my brother? You just called him right in front of us!"


Olivia jumped in. "Audrey, begging Blake to take you back isn't that shameful,but why lie about it?"

"Saying you're not here to get back together while calling him... pretty sad."Thalia added.


Audrey ignored them completely, her brow furrowed as she glanced between Alex and me.

The ringing continued. I turned to Alex, whose phone vibrated in his hand as he stared at it like it might explode.

"Aren't you going to answer that?" I asked sharply.

Alex shifted his weight, sweat beading on his forehead as everyone watched him.
"Yeah, why aren't you picking up?" Laurel teased. "Alex, is that your girlfriend calling?"

Alex quickly hit a button, and the ringing stopped. From where I stood,I heard the automated voice from Audrey's phone: "The person you are calling is currently busy, please try again later..."

I watched Audrey put her phone away, her expression shifting to one of hesitation.


The pieces clicked into place. Audrey had been calling Alex, not me. For some reason, that revelation didn't improve my mood. I asked, "Is this the single beautiful model you mentioned?"

Alex looked like he wanted to disappear. "I had no idea it was her... If I'd known, I wouldn't have asked her to return the car right now..."

"Alex, what car are you talking about?" Laurel asked, peering around me.

"That car, that car..." Alex stammered, eyes darting toward the street.

Laurel followed his gaze-and saw the red sports car parked across from the club. Her eyes lit up. "Wow,what a beautiful car!"

She released my arm and hurried toward the vehicle, her previous claims of weakness forgotten in her excitement. Her sudden mnovement sent her directly into Audrey's path.

In an instant, Laurel's shoulder collided forcefully with Audrey's. Whether it was deliberate or not, the impact nearly sent Audrey sprawling. She staggered backward, her hand reaching out for support.

My body reacted before my brain could catch up. One leg stepped forward,muscles tensed.
Felix had the same instinct. He started to move, but his buddy grabbed his arm.


"Bad idea," his friend muttered. "Stay out of ft."

Felix froze, then settled back into place with a frown.

While I was still debating whether to help, a guy in a black server uniform shot past me.

Ethan Davies.

Audrey managed to catch the lamppost, steadying herself, but Ethan reached her anyway. He gripped her shoulders, helping her balance.

"Miss Sinclair, you okay?" Real concern in his voice.

Something hot and sharp twisted in my chest. I pulled back my half-extended·leg,hoping nobody noticed.

"What are you doing here?" Audrey asked, surprise replacing the strain on her face.

"Bartending." Ethan tapped his uniform. "The owner needed extra hands for some big party tonight. Hired a bunch of us college kids with experience."

He flashed a smile that showed his dimples. "Pays double the usual rate.Couldn't pass that up."

Then he leaned in, his voice dropping as he said something just for her.She actually smiled.

The temperature around me seemed to drop ten degrees.
Alex caught the change and cleared his throat loudly.

Audrey blinked, then stepped back from Ethan, putting proper distance between them.


Meanwhile, Laurel circled the car, running her fingers over its surface. "I love this car! I saw it online recently and thought it looked amazing!" She turned toward me expectantly. "Blake darling, whose car is this?"

All eyes turned to me.

**Audrey's POV**

My shoulder throbbed where Laurel had slammed into me. If not for Ethan, I'd probably be sitting on the sidewalk right now - exactly the humiliation I wanted to avoid in front of Blake.

"Thanks," I said to Ethan.

"Anytime, Miss Sinclair." Ethan leaned in, voice dropping to barely a whisper: "Hey, I might pick up some dirt tonight."

"What do you mean?" I asked.

"These rich folks get loose-lipped after a few drinks. Might hear who's behind those online rumors about you."

I couldn't help a small smile. "If you're bartending for cash, I'm all for it."

"But digging for evidence? Don't bother."

Alex coughed pointedly. I suddenly realized Ethan still had his hand on my arm. Taking a quick step back, I broke the contact.

My eyes drifted to the gleaming car. So that's what the phone call was
about- Astrid had borrowed it from Alexander Rhodes. Despite having met him at a few events, we barely knew each other. I stood awkwardly.unsure how to approach him about returning a car I'd been driving all day.

"Blake darling, whose car is this?" Laurel asked, her voice carrying across the street.


Blake's face remained unreadable. "I bought it."

My heart sank. Blake had bought the car I'd been racing all afternoon?

"Laurel saw this car a few days ago, and now Blake bought it... is it a gift for her?" Olivia gasped dramatically.

"Obviously it's for Laurel," Thalia said. "My brother hates racing and red cars.Why would he buy something like this for himself?"

Blake's eyes seemed distant. Thalia continued, clearly performing for my benefit.


"This is a limited global edition - crazy expensive and basically impossible to find." She glanced at ne. "Some people were married to my brother for years and never got anything this nice."

She smirked. "She divorces him, and right away he buys Laurel this gorgeous car... That's gotta sting,right?"

I kept my expression neutral. I didn't care what Blake bought for Laurel. I just felt uncomfortable knowing I'd been driving a car that apparently meant something to them.

"You two, stop!" Laurel said with fake modesty. "Blake hasn't actually said he's giving it to me..."
"Brother?" Thalia pressed. "Tell us. Are you giving this car to Laurel?"

Blake looked from the car to me standing with Ethan, then back to Laurel who practically bounced beside the car. He rubbed his temples before answering.

"If Laurel likes it, it's hers."


"Really?" Laurel squealed, forgetting her supposed illness as she launched herself at Blake. "Blake darling, I'm so happy!"


She couldn't contain herself. "This is a limited edition that money can't even buy! You got it for me just because I mentioned liking it!" She gazed up at him. "You're so good to me!"

I watched with detachment. I never thought Blake would do something this extravagant for Laurel. And I'd spent the afternoon driving their special car. If I'd known, I would've stayed home with Astrid watching Netflix instead.


"Brother, where are the keys?" Thalia asked excitedly. "Let Laurel take it for a spin!"

Blake froze,glancing at Alexander with obvious discomfort.

With a sigh, I pulled the key fob from my pocket and wvalked toward them."I have the keys.Here."

Laurel's face transformed from joy to shock in an instant. Her eyes widened, voice rising shrilly. "Why do YOU have the keys to MY car?"
###Chapter 95: Miss Sinclair Owes Me an Apol ogy

**Audrey's POV**

I ignored Laurel's ridiculous question and turned to leave.

The thought that I'd spent the entire afternoon driving a car Blake was planning to give Laurel made my skin crawl with discomfort, like every inch of my body was covered in invisible thorns. Of course he would buy her a limited-edition sports car. Of course he would spare no expense for the woman he'd always prioritized over his own wife.

"Wait." I'd barely taken two steps when Thalia grabbed my wrist, her nails digging into my skin.


"Explain yourself," she demanded. "Why do you have those car keys?"


When I didn't answer, she pressed on. "Did you see this expensive car and try to steal it? Got caught and came back to return it?"


She stepped closer. "You came to my brother's divorce celebration to apologize, didn't you? That's why you showed up here."


Olivia joined in, smirking. "That makes sense. Audrey always cared about appearances. Even wanting reconciliation, she wouldn't embarrass herself like this."


She glanced around. "Must be caught stealing with no choice but to come."

Listening to the two women, I furrowed my brow slightly and calmly shook off Thalia's grip on my wrist. Three months ago, their accusations would have devastated me. I would have stood there meekly, tearfully
defending myself while trying not to cause a scene. But their opinions meant nothing to me now.

I was about to retort when Laurel approached with fake concern,"Thalia,Olivia, stop. Everyone knows Miss Sinclair's background..."

Her gaze swept over me, the disdain in her eyes obvious. "She probably hadn't seen such a nice car before and was envious. I'm sure she didn't mean to steal it."


She touched my arm. "Miss Sinclair, I understand. Don't feel guilty. As long as the car isn't damaged, it's fine."


I understood that behind Laurel's seemingly comforting words was a calculated insult about my humble origins and lack of sophistication, while simultaneously solidifying the accusation that I had secretly taken the car.Most importantly, she was giving Thalia and Olivia a new angle to attack from - one that would make me look even worse in front of everyone.

"That's it!" Thalia smacked her forehead. "We need to check for damage!"


Olivia's eyes widened. "Does she even have a license? I've never seen her drive!"


"Even if she can drive," Thalia sneered, "that doesn't mean she can handle a sports car!"

Thalia snapped her fingers, pointing at the car. "Check it for damage," she ordered her bodyguards, then shot me a cold smile. "This car costs a fortune. Even one damaged screw is more than someone who left a divorce with nothing could afford."

Each word from the two women felt like an attempt to stomp my dignity into dust. I kept my face blank despite the sting.
As the bodyguards circled the vehicle, Laurel turned to me with a smile."Even if it's damaged, I wouldn't acually make Miss Sinclair pay."

She paused. "But if something's broken, Miss Sinclair owes me an apology,right?"

I rubbed my temples. If I'd known borrowing a car would cause this drama,I'd have stayed home with Astrid.

Looking toward Blake, I noticed Alexander shifting uncomfortably beside him. Blake stared at me intensely, his expression unreadable.

Alexander cleared his throat. "Blake."

Blake glanced at him. "What?"

"Calm Laurel and your sisters down. Let Audrey go."


He lowered his voice. "Blame me for the car if needed. Don't make this uglier."


Blake's eyes narrowed as he looked at me. "Let's wait."


I understood immediately. He wanted to see how I'd handle this situation.A familiar test. I smiled bitterly at the realization.


"There's something in the car." A bodyguard's voice interrupted my thoughts.

All eyes turned to him. In his hand was a small black box with a navy blue ribbon.

Thalia snatched it. "What's this?" She glared at me. "Why would there be a gift box for a man in my brother's car for Laurel?"
I frowned. "I don't know."

That afternoon when Astrid was curiously examining the car, she had found this box in the glove compartment of the passenger seat. At the time,both she and I assumed it belonged to the car's owner, so we not only didn't touch it, we didn't dare open the glove compartment again.

Olivia gasped theatrically. "Is someone trying to win my cousin back?"

She studied the ribbon. "That's the exact blue of Blake's favorite suit. Gets divorced, takes his new car, leaves a gift begging for reconciliation..."

Before she could finish, I watched the bodyguards finish their inspection. "
Besides this gift box, did you find any damage?"

Thalia glared at them warningly.

They exchanged uncomfortable glances. "The car is brand new with no damage."


"Good." I turned to leave.


Although I didn't think my afternoon of driving would have damaged the car, it was borrowed in Astrid's name, so it was reasonable for them to check thoroughly. The box was originally in the car and had nothing to do with me. I had no obligation to stay and listen to their bickering.

"Miss Sinclair, wait," Ethan called out. "My shift just ended. I'll come with you."


He glanced in the direction of Blake. "I'm worried they might bother you."

I frowned, about to decline, but then thought of something and nodded."Alright. I actually have something to discuss with you,"
Regarding Blake and Laurel's troll farm smearing me online, I needed to confirm some evidence with Ethan. He'd been collecting information from the inside that could be valuable for my upcoming legal action.

Ethan nodded eagerly and ran back to the bar to change his clothes,while I waited.


"Leaving already?" Thalia approached, shaking the box. "Don't you want your gift?"

"It was already in the car," I replied coldly. "Not mine."

Laurel stepped forward. "Thalia, don't be harsh. How could she admit it?"


She fake-smiled. "Return it to her. Blake darling wouldn't want her things anyway."


"Return it? WNhy?" Thalia's eyes gleamed. "Since she claims it's not hers,I'll open it!"

"Let's see what's inside!"


I watched with interest. Actually, I was quite curious too. I had no idea what was in that box, but I was fairly certain it would somehow be used against me, regardless of the contents.


The box opened with a click, revealing a jewelry case and an envelope.

Thalia scoffed after peeking inside. "Cheap matching riñgs. This is your reconciliation attempt?"

She opened the envelope and read aloud:

"Mr. Parker, we heard you purchased this car because your wife enjoys racing, and you wanted to gift her this limited-edition sports car."
"Our staff were touched by your deep love for your wife, so we've included a pair of matching rings as a special gift. Wishing you both eternal happiness..."
###Chapter 96: My Works Will Be Under Rache Hayes' Name

**Audrey's POV


Thalia's voice stopped abruptly. Her eyes darted between Blake and Laurel as she realized what she'd just read.


The silence that followed was deafening.

Laurel's face turned pale, her hands curling into fists as she glared at me.

I bit my cheek to keep from smiling. Minutes earlier, Thalia had been holding those rings, calling them "cheap and tacky" when she thought Laurel had picked them out. Now that she knew they were from the dealership for Blake and his wife, I wondered if she'd suddenly find them "elegant."


Olivia coughed. "So, Laurel, I didn't know you liked racing. That explains why Blake took you to Long Island Raceway last month."

"Laurel's just full of surprises," Thalia jumped in. She hurried to Laurel's side and pushed the jewelry box into her hands. "These rings are for you and my brother. They're actually nice!"

Laurel took the box with a tight smile. "Yes, they're... lovely."

From behind Blake, someone whispered, "But the letter said the car was for Mrs. Parker, and those rings were for Mr. and Mrs. Parker... Mr.Parker only got divorced today, and Miss Rose isn't Mrs. Parker..."

The voice trailed off aseveryone turned toward a young man who shrank back.
"The dealership obviously made a mistake," Thalia snapped. "They probably only knew my brother was buying it for someone he loves,so they assumed it was for his wife. How could they know about my brother's shameless ex-wife?"

She tossed her hair back. "Besides, don't you all know Audrey grew up in some backwater town? She used to work for my grandfather! What kind of help knows how to race cars?"


Her eyes found me. "Some people probably haven't even touched a racing car."


The crowd agreed, encouraged by her meanness.


"That's right. Only someone like Miss Rose, born into privilege, would learn racing. How could Audrey know anything about it?"


"I heard she was so poor she worked multiple jobs through college.When would she have time to learn racing?"


"Poor people probably dream of just touching a steering wheel..."

While their gossip didn't bother me, Felix clearly couldn't take it anymore.
His fists clenched as his face darkened.

"You don't know anything about Audrey!" he shouted.

In an instant, all eyes landed on him

Blake raised an eyebrow, watching Felix with cold silence.

Alex grabbed his arm. "Felix, are you drunk?"

Felix's frown deepened."I..."
"Ethan!" Before he could finish, I called out loudly, cutting him off.

By now, Ethan had changed out of his server uniform and stood before me in a clean gray hoodie with matching athletic pants, a backpack over his shoulder. "Audrey, I'm ready. Should we go?"

I looked at Felix, giving him a small smile and a slight head shake.He didn't need to hurt his family's business with the Parkers by defending me.My divorce had freed me from these people, and I wouldn't drag anyone else into their world.


"Let's go," I said, turning away from their stunned faces.

With each step toward the exit, I felt lighter. I didn't care what they thought about me. These people never accepted me when I was part of their circle, and now that Blake and I were divorced, I had even less reason to explain myself.


"Audrey, I thought you were taking me home," Ethan joked as we sat in a diner near my apartment. "Didn't expect fast food."

The bright lights bounced off the worn seats, nothing like the fancy club we'd left. But it felt honest - just a quiet corner to talk.

"This place is cleaner," I said, stirring my tea. "I just got divorced in front of cameras today. You don't want to end up in gossip columns tomorrow,getting teased for going home with a divorced woman, right?"

"If that happened, they'd be jealous, not teasing."

I smiled despite everything. Ethan coud lighten even tough moments.

He leaned forward, serious now. "I've spent all day getting friendly with those troll farm admins. I know who's been coordinating the attacks
against you."

"Who?" I set my cup down.

"Someone named Jennifer Carson meets them and assigns their daily tasks."He watched my face. "Know her?"

"Laurel Rose's agent," I nodded.

His eyebrows shot up. "Seriously? Isn't that careless? Using her own agent makes it easy to trace back to her."


"It's not carelessness," I said with a cold smile. "It's arrogance. She thinks she can do whatever she wants without consequences."

I ran my finger along my cup. "She expects me to be like before-swallowing every insult, never fighting back."

"Audrey..." Ethan looked concerned.

I waved it off. "It's in the past."

"Yeah," he agreed,though still troubled."It's over."

He sent me the evidence he'd collected. We spent the next two hours going through messages and payment records linking Jennifer Carson to the smear campaign. By 10:30,we had everything we needed.

Though Ethan kept things light, I saw the anger beneatb. I suspected he understood how much I'd endured during my marriage. The fact that someone I'd known briefly understood me better than my husband of three years was both comforting and sad.

A few months ago, I might have hesitated to move against Laurel. I would have worried about William's reputation and the Parker name. But now? I
had nothing to lose and little time left. Why protect people who never protected me?

After putting Ethan in a taxi. I walked the last few blocks home alone.The night air felt cool on my skin. I stretched my arms out, taking deep breaths as I walked, feeling freer than I had in years.


The divorce I'd dreaded had finally happened, and the world hadn't ended.It felt like a new beginning - brief, given my diagnosis, but mine to control.


I was so deep in thought I almost missed the figure by my door until I reached for my keys.


"Audrey."

I turned to see James standing in the hallway, his tall frame casting a shadow in the dim light.

I closed my door, leaning against it. "James. It's late. What do you want?"

He noticed my defensive stance, his face falling. "I saw the news today."

He held out a small package. "I brought you a divorce gift."

I didn't take it.


James smiled bitterly. "Audrey, I know you're still mad about letting Snow escape,but..."

I remembered the night I collapsed and James let my cat out, then told Blake I didn't want her. Snow had been one of the few genuine gifts from my marriage. James knew what she meant to me, but he deliberately destroyed that connection.
"We're going to be colleagues," he continued. "Can't we be civil? We need to produce your designs in the next three months, remember?"

Finally, I took the box. "Fine."

"When can I start at the studio?" I asked.

He looked surprised. "Whenever you want, but... don't you need time to recover after everything?"


"There's nothing to recover from."

"So tomorrow works?"

"Yes," he nodded, then paused. "But management spoke with me today."

He shifted uneasily. "Your divorce is all over the news, and Parker Group is expanding into jewelry..."

James looked at me directly. "To avoid problems, your designs...might need a different name."


I saw his discomfort, his expectation that I'd be upset. Instead, I felt oddly peaceful.


"That's fine," I replied calmly. "My works will be under Rachel Hayes'name."
###Chapter 97: Would You Like Me to I nvesti gate?

**Audrey's POV**

"Rachel Hayes... she was your friend, right? I remember you and Astrid mentioning her in college."

James's question broke the comfortable silence between us. He frowned slightly as he watched me put away the jewelry box he'd given me as a "divorce gift."


I slipped the box into my purse and pushed my hands into my coat pockets, adopting a casual stance that belied the immediate tension I felt at hearing Rachel's name. "She was one of my closest friends."

"During college, I actually met Astrid through her," I added, allowing a hint of a'smile.


James raised an eyebrow. "Was she a student at our university? I don't think I ever saw her around."


The question wasn't surprising. During college, James and I had been close - closer than I now felt comfortable acknowledging. We'd nearly dated before life pulled us in different directions. He'd heard me mention Rachel countless times, yet never actually met her.

"She didn't attend college due to family reasons," I said with a sigh. "She rarely visited campus."

James watched me,clearly sensing there was more to the story. The memories were already pulling me back, whether I wanted to go there or not.
I still remembered Rachel's face when she first explained why she couldn't attend college. We sat at a café near my dorm, rain tapping against the windows.

"I was born from my mother's affair," Rachel said, tracing patterns on the table. "For me, my mom divorced her husband and married my father."


Her voice remained steady, but her eyes revealed her pain.


"After my father died, mom's ex-husband took her back to give my sister a complete family. I ended up with my grandparents."

I listened, shocked and unsure what to say.

"Mom always felt she owed my sister everything," Rachel continued. "When my sister failed her college entrance exams, she threw a fit...so Mom switched our scores."


My coffee sat untouched as I listened.

"My sister went to her dream university while I got stuck with her scores at some no-name school. Mom said this was what we owed my sister."

The resignation in her voice cut deeper than anger would have.

The memories shifted to another evening at The Underground. Rachel grabbed a bottle from the bar, drinking directly from it.

"I always thought I was Mom's precious baby," she sáid. "That day I realized my sister was the one who mattered."

Her makeup smeared slightly, eyes too bright. "I was so depressed that year. Drank daily, missed the next entrance exam, never got back on track."

She looked at me, suddenly focused despite the alcohol. "That's why I
envy you. Audrey. You grew up with nothing, but you still get to chase your dreams."

I felt guilty -guilty for having chances Rachel deserved but never got.

"Audrey, I know you love jewelry design," Rachel said, brightening."Someday,let's make jewelry together..."

Even years later, those memories made my heart ache.

"Audrey."

James's voice yanked me back to reality. I blinked, disoriented.

"So you and Rachel Hayes... were very close?" He studied me intently.

I raised an eyebrow questioningly.

"Don't misunderstand," he quickly added. "Your designs are excellent and will be popular. If you're using her name, there could be copyright issues...



He spread his hands. "It could get complicated."

I paused briefly before offering a tight smile. "There won't be any."

Four years ago, Rachel became comatose after an accident, and her family disappeared abroad with her.

In truth, I hoped Rachel's family would see my designs under her name.Something to show someone still remembered her.

*After four years, is Rachel doing well? Has she woken up, or is she...*

**Blake's POV**
"Audrey..."

Morning light speared through my eyelids. I groaned, shielding my eyes from the assault. My head throbbed with a serious hangover.

"What time is it..."Ipatted around for my phone.

Reality seeped in slowly. The courthouse. The cameras. Audrey walking away without looking back. Our divorce.

"Audrey Sinclair..." I called again, fully aware of the emptiness that would answer.


9:17 AM. Later than I should be awake. No urgent messages, no missed calls. Somehow the world kept spinning without my supervision.

I sat up, making my head pound worse. This mansion felt hollow, eerily quiet without her presence.

I grabbed my phone and called Michael.

"Bring hangover soup to Lunar Mansion," I ordered without greeting.

After a pause, Michael responded, "Sir, you went back to Lunar Mansion last night?"

"Is that a problem?" I snapped.

"No, not at all," he quickly answered. "I've been looking for you everywhere.Your phone was unreachable."

My frown deepened. "Looking for me about what?"

"It's important."
Yesterday,Audrey and I had divorced under the watchful eyes of the entire internet. This mansion was one of many properties I owned. I'd rarely stayed here during our marriage, avoiding Audrey whenever possible. Yet since she moved out. I found myself returning frequently.


When I was hungover before, Audrey would wake me on time with warm soup ready. She moved through the house efficiently,knowing exactly when to speak and when to leave me alone. Now only my voice echoed back at me.


After a moment, Michael spoke again. "Do you remember those design drafts you personally reviewed, the ones you particularly liked?"

I sat up straighter. "I do."

"Original Studio responded," Michael said. "The designer just started today.They'll need time for the detailed proposal, but they've submitted more of this designer's work."


I shifted, suddenly alert despite my hangover."And?"

"I think you should look at them immediately." Something in his voice made me pay attention.

"Also..." he hesitated, "the designer's name... I'm not sure if it's a coincidence."


I took a deep breath, impatient. "Just say it. What's wrong with the name?"

Brief silence. "The designer's name is Rachel Hayes."

My hand froze mid-motion. "Rachel Hayes?"

"Yes," Michael confirmed. "The same name as Miss Rose's half-sister who
had died four years ago."

Parker Group had always been involved in jewelry, but design innovation had been lacking. Recently, I'd established a new jewelry company with Laurel to attract grassroots designers. One submission from Original Studio immediately caught my eye. With the family drama and divorce proceedings. I'd almost forgotten about it.

When I was blind years ago, Rachel Hayes and Laurel Rose had cared for me. During those dark days, Rachel mentioned wanting to start a jewelry company with her sister. The dream supposedly died wvith her accident.

"I suspect they might know your connection to the jewelry company,"
Michael continued, "and are testing you with Miss Rose's sister's name."

He paused before asking, "Regarding this Rachel Hayes, would you like me to investigate?"
###Chapter 98: I Plan to Meet This Designer in Person

**Blake's POV**

I gazed out the window. Morning light hit the hardwood floors of Lunar Mansion, making my hangover worse.


"Handle it as you see fit," I finally said. "Just bring the design drafts and hangover soup."


I hung up and moved to the dining table, where I began examining some jewelry samples from Parker Group. Despite my pounding headache, I forced myself to focus on the business at hand.

Half an hour later, the electronic lock beeped. Michael walked in with a thermal container and portfolio. I hadn't moved,still studying the designs.

"Sir," he greeted softly.

He crossed to the dining table and poured steaming soup into a bowvl,his eyes scanning the room.

"Miss Rose isn't here?" he finally asked.

I looked up, fixing him with a cold stare. "Why would Laurel be here?"

Michael faltered. "The last time I visited, she was - "

"I've arranged other accommodations for her," I cut him off. "She's a single woman. It wouldn't be appropriate for her to stay in a house I frequently visit."


As I spoke, I found myself taking in the room. Staff had removed all
traces of Laurel. The decor had returned from pink tones to the cream and natural wood that Audrey preferred.

Most noticeably, Laurel's photo was gone, replaced with my wedding portrait with Audrey. In it, I wore my usual serious look while Audrey leaned against me, smiling.

Michael frowned. "Sir, that photograph... should I have it removed?"

"What's the point?" I replied. "It would just need to be put back up eventually."

Michael paused, then nodded. "Of course."

He added. "Mrs. Parker has always threatened divorce or leaving. When you ignore it, she gets bored and comes back to apologize. This time is just more dramatic than usual."


Something about his assessment shifted my mood slightly. The image of Audrey walking away with our divorce certificate flashed through my mind, but I dismissed it.


I sipped the soup while examining the designs Michael had brought. The sketches had been refined based on my suggestions, with improvements to the original concepts.

Michael cleared his throat, "Sir."

"Since the designer's name is Rachel Hayes, I was curious. On my way here,I called Original Studio to learn more."

"They say this designer is mysterious, She's joined their studio but hasn't worked there in person yet."
"Her only requirement is that the jewelry be produced within three months.
1

"That's nearly impossible," Michael explained. "Only companies with major backing and aggressive production would attempt such a timeline. That's why they approached our new venture."

I examined the sketches, appreciating the details. "Why the three-month deadline? Did you ask?"


"I did," Michael replied hesitantly. "It sounds made up."

"They claim she has a terminal illness with only three months to live. She wants to see her work on the market before she dies."

My fingers paused briefly as I flipped through the designs.

"TerminaI illness? Only three months?" I kept my voice neutral.

I laughed coldly. "This designer will do anything for attention."

"Rachel Hayes has been dead for four years, and now someone's giving her a terminal illness..."


I set the designs aside. "Make arrangements. I plan to meet this designer in person."

**Audrey's POV**

"Audrey,are you up?" James knocked on my door at eight in the morning.

I opened quickly. His surprise was immediate - his eyes widened at my newly cut short hair and pink casual outfit. The morning sunlight caught my fresh haircut, and I felt lighter, like I'd shed more than just hair.
"You... cut your hair?" he asked after a moment.

I smiled. "Last night after you left, I thought I should make some changes for my first day, so I cut it myself."

I touched the ends. "It doesn't look bad, does it?"

James shook his head. "You could become a stylist."

I laughed. "Tll pass. For now, I just want to design jewelry."

I closed my door and walked toward the elevator. "Let's go."

James caught up. "You haven't had breakfast, have you? I bought something for you."

During my marriage to Blake, I'd gotten used to caring for others while neglecting myself. Having someone think of my needs felt strange but nice.I took the paper bag, finding a croissant and fruit inside.

"Thanks," I said simply.

Half an hour later, we arrived at Original Studio. Being my first day, James led me to meet management. We knocked and entered the director's office.

George Mei was on the phone. "Your company's investor wants to meet Ms.Hayes?" he asked eagerly.

"No problem at all. She started today and is available anytime. Just let us know when!"

He ended the call. "Yes, yes, we'll be in touch!"

As he hung up, George turned with a practiced smile. James stepped forward. "Mr. Mei, this is -"
"T've seen enough news about Ms. Sinclair lately," George interrupted. "No need for introductions."

George was a balding man in his fifties with shrewd written all over him.He waved James off and turned his calculating smile to me.


"Ms. Sinclair, I never expected to meet you in person!" His warmth seemed exaggerated. "You're prettier than in the news! But I should remind you,we're under Cartier Jewelry Group, focusing only on jewelry design. That won't be a problem, right?"


I understood his concern - he worried my divorce drama might affect the studio.


"Mr. Mei, I've completed all the paperwork. I'm your employee now, so please direct me as needed."


George laughed. "Excellent! No wonder James requested his transfer here from Cartier."


He then explained the phone call - a client had seen my designs and asked to meet me.


"For them to pick your design from all those submissions proves your work is exceptional!" George said.


"This company is backed by a multinational conglomerate with substantial resources. If our studio completes this project, our reputation will soar."

George offered me tea. "Ms. Sinclair, it all depends on your performance."

As I sipped, George addressed what was clearly bothering him: "James must have mentioned that due to your recent news... your designs will use Rachel Hayes' name, and you'll need to keep your identity confidential..."
He leaned forward. "Can you accept this condition?"

I set down the teacup and nodded. "Yes."

George sighed with relief. "Once the controversy dies down, you can use your own name on future projects."

*Future projects.* If only he knew those didn't exist for me. I kept my face neutral, hiding my diagnosis.

"The investor is busy," George added. "Your meeting is in three days. You-



Suddenly, a panicked employee burst in. "Emergency! We have a problem!"

He explained frantically: "Alex, who was supposed to supervise the fashion magazine photo shoot, got food poisoning and couldn't make it. The magazine wants someone else!"


"They won't take responsibility if our jewelry goes missing, but our studio is short-staffed. We have no one available..." He was sweating. "What should we do?"


I watched George's face tighten. Before James could speak, I stepped forward.


"I'll go," I offered. "Everyone else seems busy, so sending me,the newcomer,makes the most sense."
###Chapter 99: Do You Know That Designer?

**Audrey's POV**

The taxi inched through the traffic. I checked the time, relieved to see I'd still make it on time to the photoshoot location.

The cab pulled up to a sleek building. Just as I stepped out of the car,I heard familiar voices that made me freeze.


"Laurel,when are you planning to take me and Olivia for a ride in that sports car?" It was Thalia!


"No rush. Let's wait until after Blake and I get engaged," came Laurel's sugary reply.


They walked right past me without a glance, too absorbed in their conversation to notice.

"Oh right!" Thalia exclaimed. "My brother is proposing to you in two days!He's been so secretive about it, hasn't told us anything... I almost forgot!"

"Blake darling probably wants to surprise me," LaureI said,brushing her sleeve. "I'm not in a hurry. As long as he's divorced from that woman,I don't care when we get engaged or married."

"You might not be in a hurry, but my brother definitely is," Thalia laughed."Why else would he rush to divorce that woman yesterday if not to avoid delaying the engagemnent ceremony he'd already arranged? Aren't you excited?"

"Of course I'm excited," Laurel replied with a practiced smile.

Their voices faded as they walked away. I rubbed my achingtemple and
grabbed the case from the studio, heading straight for the photoshoot venue.

Just my damn luck. The direction Laurel and Thalia came from had to be exactly where I needed to go. And today's stars? None other than Laurel Rose and Thalia Parker.


If I'd known, I would've told George to find someone else.

The moment I entered with my case, a frazzled production assistant spotted me and made a beeline in my direction.


"Are you the jewelry assistant from Original Studio?" he demanded."Your studio is so unprofessional!"


"Do you have any idea who's wearing your studio's jewelry today?"

"I was told - "

"It's the Hollywood actress Laurel Rose and her boyfriend's sister, Thalia Parker!"


"These people wouldn't normally wear pieces from your studio. They're doing the magazine a favor, and you have the nerve to be late?"

I thought I was just coming to supervise the jewelry. Turns out I'd be a full-fledged assistant too. Well, since it's work, I might as well do it right.

So, I smiled, "Where should I set up, and when does the shoot begin?"

The effect was immediate. His anger deflated as he noticed I wasn't arguing back.

"Over there," he muttered, pointing to a preparation area. "Hurry up."
I nodded and made my way backstage and joined the wardrobe assistant.We spent the next hour matching jewelry pieces to the outfits for the shoot.

Laurel and Thalia returned from their coffee break.

The set transformed as everyone snapped into action - stylists adjusting clothes, makeup artists touching up faces, the photographer checking lighting.

I grabbed a baseball cap and face mask from my bag and put them on.Better to stay anonymous.


No one glanced twice at me - just another faceless crew member doing her job.


The day passed without incident. Click after click of the camera. Hand over this necklace, retrieve that bracelet. Routine work.

By evening. I let ouIt a breath I didn't know I'd been holding.

Almost done. Just a few more minutes and I'd be free.

Then Blake walked in.

I was standing behind Laurel, fingers working the tiny clasp of her statement necklace, when it happened.

"Blake darling!"

Her voice pierced the quiet concentration of the set.

Before I could react, she shot up from her chair toward him.

The necklace was still in my hands when she moved.
"Ouch!" She winced, touching her neck.

I immediately let go,but too late. Thalia zeroed in on me like a missile.

"What have you done?" she snapped, raising her hand to strike.

I released the necklace and closed my eyes. But the slap never landed.

"Thalia, don't do this."

I opened my eyes to find Blake standing there, gripping Thalia's wrist.

"I apologize," he said, looking at me. "My sister has a bit of a temper."

His eyes narrowed slightly as he studied what little of my face showed.
Recognition flickered across his features.

"Miss, have we met before?"

I almost laughed. Have we met? We shared a bed for three years and only
divorced yesterday. He can't recognize me with a mask on?

"No," I said calmly, "I don't believe so, Mr. Parker."

Thalia yanked free from Blake's grip,eyes cold.

"Why are you apologizing to her?" she demanded. "She hurt Laurel.Are you blind?"


"It was an accident," Blake replied.

"She needs a lesson," Thalia insisted, gesturing at me with disgust.

Laurel stepped between them, never missing a chance to perform. "Thalia.
It's okay. Let's drop it."
She touched her neck gently with a wince. "I'm not hurt, really."

Then she puled out a mirror to examine her neck. "But... is it getting red?"

Thalia leaned in, gasping dramatically. "It is! It almost bled!"

I raised an eyebrow at the ridiculous exaggeration. All I could see was the faintest pink line where the chain briefly pressed. I couldn't cover my disdain, which fueled Thalia's anger.


"Laurel is a performer," Thalia glared at me. "Don't you know how important her image is? How dare you look at her like that?"


She lunged at me again, but this time I caught her wrist. I didn't squeeze -just held it in place.

Thalia's eyes widened. No one had ever stopped her before.

"I was just doing my job," I said quietly. "Miss Rose moved suddenly while I was unfastening her necklace."

I released Thalia's wrist and turned to Laurel.

"Miss Rose, I apologize for being too slow with the necklace. But I didn't mean to hurt you."


I stepped toward her. "Give me one minute to unfasten it."

Laurel immediately backed up against Blake. "Don't touch ,me! Stay away!"

Her eyes filled with perfect tears as she looked up at him. "Blake darling.I don't want her near me.., can you help instead?"

She turned slightly, showing off the barely-visible mark. "She already hurt me once..."
Blake's expression softened."Of course."

I watched him unfasten the necklace quickly. Laurel leaned into his touch,eyes closing in supposed relief.

As Blake removed the necklace, he noticed something on it. He turned it over, examining the small tag with Original Studio's logo.

"You're from Original Studio?" he asked, looking at me.

I paused briefly. "Yes."

Blake studied the piece with new interest. "Your studio has a designer named Hayes. Do you know that designer?"

My heart jumped. Hayes? My first thought is the Rachel Hayes name I'm using. But that seems too coincidental. Parker Group has jewelry subsidiaries, but they only accept famous designers. Work from an unknown newcomer like me would be trashed immediately. Maybe Original Studio has another Hayes designer?

"I just started working atthe studio," I answered carefully. "I'm not very famniliar with everyone."

"I see, you're new," Blake nodded, still examining the necklace.

Thalia snorted. "No wonder you're so unprofessional."

"I apologize," I didn't argue. "My carelessness has given both ladies an unpleasant experience."

Blake still held the necklace, turning it over thoughtfully. I checked my watch.

"Mr. Parker, my shift is ending." I needed that necklace back so I could
pack everything up and escape this nightmare scenario.
###Chapter 100: Miss Sinclair's Short Hair Look Pretty

**Blake's POV**

I examined the necklace in my hands. Elegant craftsmanship with gemstones that caught the light just right. But what really grabbed my attention was the woman standing in front of me, face hidden behind a surgical mask and baseball cap.

Something about her tugged at my memory.

She hadn't said much since I arrived, just quietly helping Laurel and Thalia with their jewelry. But when she spoke - her speech pattern, the way she formed sentences - it reminded me of someone.

Her eyes visible above the mask, her slender build, how her hands moved as she reached for the necklace... it all felt like Audrey.

That couldn't be right. Audrey always wore her hair long. She was almost obsessive about it. Just yesterday at our divorce, she'd pulled it back in that confident high ponytail she favored.

I remembered something from the months I was trapped in my body.conscious but unable to respond. Audrey sitting beside me, thinking I couldn't hear.


"*I'll never cut my hair," she'd whispered. "*My friend always said I look best with long hair. She told me never to cut it... and even though she's gone now, I'll keep it this way. I wouldn't want to disappoint her.*"

Looking at this short-haired woman, I dismissed the thought. Audrey wouldn't break that promise, especially not within a day of our divorce.
"Blake darling?"

Laurel's voice interrupted my thoughts. She slipped her hand around my arm. "What's on your mind?"

I noticed the masked woman still extending her hand, waiting for me to return the necklace. I studied her again, my suspicion growing.

"Seriously, have we met before?" I asked directly.


She hesitated. Even with most of her face covered, I could tell she was uncomfortable. Just as she was about to answer, a male voice sounded.

"Audrey!"

**Audrey's POV**

My heart sank when James called my name. So close to getting through the day unnoticed.


James rushed over, concern written all over his face. He pulled me behind him, shielding me from the Parkers.

"Mr. Parker," he said coldly, "Audrey has already divorced you. Why are you at this photoshoot harassing her?"


The room went silent. I closed my eyes briefly,accepting my cover was blown.


"She's Audrey Sinclair?" Thalia's voice rose in disbelief.

James froze, finally noticing my disguise. He turned to me, confused about why I was hiding.

I met his gaze, letting him see my resignation. After enduring Laurel and
Thalia's demands and petty comments all day, I'd nearly escaped when Blake showed up. Now James had exposed me,though he meant well.

"So the jewelry assistant helping us all day was... Miss Sinclair?"Laurel's voice was genuinely surprised. She glanced between me and Blake, whose face had hardened. "No wonder you thought she seemed familiar."

Blake stared at me while Laurel clung to his arm. His intense gaze made my skin tingle.


"What happened to your hair?" he asked quietly. "You said you'd never cut it. For your friend's sake."


I sighed and removed my cap and mask. No point hiding anymore.My newly cropped hair framed my face, now thinner and more angular from recent weight loss.


"She didn't come back to see me once in four years," I said. "I got tired of waiting."


As I mentioned "four years", I noticed Laurel's reaction from the corner of my eye. Her fingers tightened on Blake's arm, her face paled before she quickly recovered.


"Míss Sinclair's short hair looks pretty," she said with a practiced smile,changing the subject.

Blake kept staring, the expressions in his eyes unreadable.,

"I knew it!" Thalia jumped in. "That's why she hurt Laurel when taking off the necklace. She wanted revenge!"

I looked at Thalia calmly despite her accusation. "Should I repeat myself?Miss Rose moved suddenly while I was unfastening her necklace. That
caused the tension. I've already apologized."

I walked past James straight to Blake and took the necklace from him.

"I've been helping both ladies all day," I said. "I've handled jewelry around their necks, ears, and wrists. If I wanted revenge, they wouldn't be standing here unharmed."

I turned away and carefully put the necklace in its case. "James, let's go."

James snapped out of his confusion."Right."

Before we left, he faced Blake and Laurel, his expression hard. "If I'd known you two would be at today's shoot, I never would have let Audrey come here!"


**Blake's POV**

James stood protectively next to Audrey, practically radiating possessiveness. The sight irritated me for reasons I didn't want to examine.


"Last I checked, Original Studio was run by George Mei," I said casually."Since when do you decide staff assignments?"

James's face darkened. His hands balled into fists at his sides.

"The studio isn't mine," he admitted. "But as a senior employee, I can protect new colleagues from harassment."

I laughed softly and pulled out my phone, dialing while maintaining eye contact with him.

"Blake Parker here," I said when the call connected. "I have a business proposition for Original Studio. All jewelry for Laurel Rose and Thalia Parker's public appearances will come exclusively from your team."I
paused. "One condition - your new assistant, Audrey Sinclair, must personally handle all appointments. Otherwise, no deal."

I ended the call and gave James a dismissive look. "Think George will agree?"

James trembled with anger. "You - " he started, but couldn't finish.


"I'll ask George for a raise," Audrey cut in smoothly, betraying none of the tension visible in her shoulders. "Thanks for the exposure opportunity, Mr.Parker."


She grabbed James's arm."Let's go."

James shot me one last glare before following her out, jaw clenched tight.

"Audrey, you got nothing in the divorce," James's voice carried as they walked away. "Why is he still targeting you?"


"I'm calling George as soon as we get back to cancel this," he continued."We could find jobs at another studio,away from them..."


Audrey didn't respond to his complaints, maintaining her silence as they left.


I watched her go,struck by how different she looked. During our marriage,Audrey had been the perfect Parker wife - long hair styled just so,designer dresses carefully chosen, every mannerism polished.

This new Audrey with casual clothes and short hair looked sharper, more intelligent, more authentic. She was more striking now than when playing my perfect wife.

But seeing James Collins beside her just made me feel angry.
"Well, well," Thalia said, breaking into my thoughts. "Barely divorced and already hanging around that college friend."

She crossed her arms smugly. "Weren't there rumors about them before the divorce? Maybe that baby she lost was actually his -"

"Thalia!" I snapped, may voice harsher than intended.

Thalia's mouth shut, her expression sullen but quiet.


"I never imagined Miss Sinclair would end up a jewelry assistant after divorcing you," Laurel said once Audrey and James disappeared. "Relying on old connections..."


She looked up at me with concern. "But Blake darling, are you sure you want Thalia and me wearing pieces from that unknown studio? I worry-"

"Don't worry about it," I cut her off. "They're a studio with exceptional design sensibilities."
