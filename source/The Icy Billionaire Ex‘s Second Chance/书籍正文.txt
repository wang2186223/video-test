###Chapter 1

The heart of Crestwood was alive with chaos as flames erupted violently within an aging apartment building.

Wind whipped through the streets, feeding the fire as it devoured the structure. Thick plumes of smoke and searing tongues of flame clawed at the sky.

"Saved! They're out!" The cry cut through the pandemonium.

Firefighters emerged from the burning wreckage, carrying Vivian Hartley to safety at the curb.

Her usually elegant features were smudged with ash, her bright eyes dulled to a hollow stare.

As awareness returned, a wave of gratitude crashed over her—so unlike her usual composed demeanor.

Her voice was raw as she whispered a hoarse "thank you" to her rescuers.

Trembling, she fumbled for her phone, fingers shaking as she dialed the familiar number.

"The person you're trying to reach is unavailable—"

The automated message cut off with a deafening BOOM.

Vivian's head snapped up just in time to see the apartment she'd escaped erupt into a fireball.

Debris rained down as screams tore through the crowd. Survivors clung to each other, their terror palpable.

Amid the chaos, Vivian sat alone on the stretcher, her isolation stark against the backdrop of panic.

"Adrian—" She pressed her lips together and redialed, refusing to let fear take hold.

Again, the call disconnected after just a few rings.

Then, a Twitter notification flashed on her screen.

The gossip feed was ablaze: #SerenaWhitmore #MysteryMan.

According to the tweet, a high-profile producer had invited the famous actress Serena Whitmore to dinner, only for tensions to flare when she refused a toast.

The confrontation escalated—until her "domineering boyfriend" stormed in.

He'd dismissed the producer with a single gesture before whisking Serena away.

The photos showed only the man's back, his identity carefully obscured.

But Vivian recognized that silhouette anywhere.

Her fingers tightened around the phone.

The screen went dark.
###Chapter 2

Serena Whitmore smiled coyly, the sleeves of Adrian Blackwood's designer jacket swallowing her delicate wrists as they walked away together, fingers intertwined.

Vivian Hartley's phone screen burned the image into her retinas.

There he stood - Adrian Blackwood in all his arrogant glory.

That unmistakable jacket hanging off Serena's shoulders was like a knife twisting in Vivian's gut.

Every stitch of Adrian's wardrobe came from an exclusive Milanese tailor - a fact Vivian knew intimately from two years of marriage.

Her fingers turned bone-white around the phone, nails biting into the case. A corrosive ache spread through her chest, more acidic than the smoke she'd just escaped.

When death had breathed down her neck, Adrian had chosen Serena. Again.

What had their marriage even meant?

Hot tears breached their dam, streaking down her soot-smudged cheeks.

Tilting her head back only made them slide faster, tracing the hollows of her throat.

Everyone knew Serena Whitmore had been Adrian's first love. The society pages never let anyone forget.

The Blackwoods had deemed the middle-class art student unworthy of their golden heir.

Though Serena had been the one to walk away, the past clearly hadn't stayed buried.

Adrian had clawed his way to control of Blackwood Group, fueled by dreams of reclaiming his lost love.

By the time he seized power, Serena had already married some French winemaker.

In defiance - or perhaps spite - Adrian had chosen Vivian, another "unworthy" woman, as his bride. A human shield against his family's matchmaking.

Vivian had her own reasons for saying yes. Her father Richard Dawson's threats. Her grandmother Eleanor's mounting medical bills. A shotgun wedding to some playboy heir.

Two desperate people. One transactional marriage.

Originally contracted for twelve months, their arrangement had stretched into a second year through unspoken mutual agreement.

Somewhere along the way, Vivian had started believing their fiction.

Tonight's fire had burned away those illusions.

When death came knocking, Adrian had been too busy playing knight to Serena to answer his wife's call.

There was no marriage. Only Vivian's pathetic delusion.

She wasn't even a consolation prize. Just a pawn in Adrian's lifelong game of familial rebellion.
###Chapter 3

A heavy silence filled the air before Vivian's eyes brimmed with tears, spilling over in an unstoppable wave of grief.

Perhaps it was time. Time to break free from the chains of her own foolish hopes—to stop lying to herself.

The hospital was in chaos, overrun with victims from the fire. Doctors and nurses rushed through the halls, their faces strained with exhaustion as they struggled to keep up.

Vivian had been lucky. A splintered clothes rack had grazed her calf, leaving behind a jagged but shallow wound.

Compared to the devastation around her, her injury was nothing.

After a quick cleaning and bandaging at the nearest clinic, she hailed a cab and returned to the one place she was supposed to call home.

Seabreeze Villa, a sprawling estate under Adrian Blackwood's name, was technically their marital residence.

But in reality, Vivian had lived there alone for years. Adrian was rarely around.

She had dismissed the housekeeper long ago, realizing she didn’t need much—just takeout, grocery deliveries, and the occasional visit from a cleaning service.

Now, standing in the vast living room, she sank onto the sofa, her gaze drifting over the empty space.

The decor was sleek, monochrome, and utterly devoid of warmth.

A cold realization settled over her: this grand, silent house felt more like a mausoleum—a tomb for her wasted youth and the love that had slipped through her fingers.

Would anyone even notice if she stopped breathing one day?

Vivian exhaled, her body heavy as she pushed herself up from the couch. She leaned against the wall for support, wincing as she climbed the stairs to her bedroom.

Every step sent sharp jolts of pain through her, from her wounded leg to the very marrow of her bones.

The house was too quiet, amplifying even the smallest sounds—her own breathing, the rustle of fabric, the creak of the floorboards beneath her feet.

It was in this suffocating silence that Vivian truly understood the depth of her loneliness. It clung to her, thick and tangible, pressing in from all sides.

By the time she reached her bedroom, she was exhausted—physically, emotionally. She collapsed onto the bed, her body sinking into the mattress like a stone.

Just as she closed her eyes, the shrill ring of her phone shattered the silence.

She hesitated before answering.

"You called earlier. What do you want?"

Adrian’s voice was as cold and detached as ever.

Vivian froze, caught off guard by his sudden contact.

She opened her mouth to respond, but before she could speak, a soft, feminine voice drifted through the line.

"Adrian, are you coming back to—"

The call cut off abruptly.

Vivian’s grip on the phone tightened.

She didn’t need to hear the rest.

The silence that followed was deafening.
###Chapter 4

A wave of emotions crashed over Vivian as her fingers tightened around the phone, each heartbeat echoing louder in her chest.

Unable to suppress her growing panic, she blurted out, "Who's with you right now?"

Adrian remained silent for a beat before responding in that detached tone she'd come to dread. "If it's urgent, we'll talk when I return. I'm occupied at the moment."

The line went dead before she could form a response.

The sharp dial tone mocked her as Vivian's lips curled into a bitter smile.

How pathetic she was. Some part of her had already known the answer, yet she'd still hoped to hear him say the words.

With deliberate movements, Vivian picked up her tablet and scrolled through the day's trending topics.

One headline jumped out at her: "Rising Star Protected from Harassment by Powerful Boyfriend at Industry Dinner." A hollow laugh escaped her.

She knew those dinners all too well.

The memory surfaced unbidden - her first major audition after entering the entertainment industry. Her agent Lydia had dragged her to a dinner with the director and producer of Whispering Skies.

Young and inexperienced, Vivian had felt like a lamb among wolves, completely unprepared for the dark underbelly of show business.

The producer had leered at her openly before sliding a bottle across the table. "New talent, huh? Pretty face. Let's see if you can handle your liquor. Finish this bottle in one go, and I'll guarantee you an audition for the female lead."

She'd wanted to refuse, but under Lydia's insistent pressure, she'd choked down every last drop.

By midnight, she'd been rushed to the hospital with acute alcohol poisoning.

Lydia, more concerned about losing the role than Vivian's health, had paid the medical bills and disappeared.

Vivian had spent three days recovering in that sterile hospital room.

Before she'd even been discharged, the news broke that Serena Whitmore had landed the lead role in Whispering Skies.

Later, Lydia had berated her. "You're prettier than Serena! Why can't you be more ambitious? She just had to bat her eyelashes at Mr. Blackwood and everything was handed to her on a silver platter. I heard he personally called the producers to secure her that role!"

When the drama aired, Serena skyrocketed to fame overnight, joining the A-list with effortless grace.

That was when Vivian had given up on her acting dreams and devoted herself entirely to being Adrian Blackwood's wife.

After all, no matter how hard she worked, she'd never receive the opportunities that came so easily to Serena with just a word from Adrian.

Back then, Vivian had believed she was stealing Serena's rightful place as Mrs. Blackwood. She'd thought she owed Serena that much.


###Chapter 5

The moment Vivian Hartley sacrificed her career opportunities for Serena Whitmore, she thought it would settle the unspoken debt between them.

But life had other plans.

Serena didn’t just take the career—she took Adrian Blackwood’s heart as well.

As Serena’s star rose in both love and work, Vivian was left with nothing but regret. She had been so consumed by love that she neglected everything else. Now, she had neither.

Tears burned down her cheeks as she reflected on the past two years. What a waste.

If she could go back, she would never have let herself fall so recklessly for Adrian’s charm.

Never again.

A sharp buzz from her phone snapped her out of her thoughts.

"Ms. Hartley, the revised copyright contract is ready. Please review it for any discrepancies."

Vivian stared at the PDF file attached to the message, her pulse quickening.

Under the pen name Vivian Hartley, she had once been a promising screenwriter, selling scripts for quick cash in her early days.

Back then, she had been desperate—her grandmother’s medical bills had been suffocating.

But now? Those same scripts had become blockbusters, turning her pseudonym into something sought after.

By the time she married Adrian, the financial struggles were behind her. She had settled into domestic life, determined to be the perfect wife.

Her identity as Vivian Hartley had faded into the background.

Until now.

A buyer had recently approached her, offering a staggering sum for one of her old scripts.

She had hesitated at first, raising concerns about the contract. To her surprise, they had revised it exactly as she requested.

Now, holding the finalized document, she took a deep breath.

A decision had been made.

Her fingers flew across her phone screen, typing out a message with cold precision.

"Draft a divorce agreement under my terms. Deliver it to Adrian Blackwood at the Blackwood Group."

Without waiting for a reply, she tossed her phone aside and limped toward the bathroom, each step heavy with resolve.

Thirty minutes later, she finally dragged herself out of the bathtub, her limbs numb.

But her mind?

Sharper than ever.
###Chapter 6

Vivian's breath caught as she raised her eyes to the mirror. The reflection staring back at her showed skin like polished alabaster, flawless and glowing with an ethereal luminosity.

Her emerald eyes shimmered with mysterious depth, radiating a warmth that could melt even the coldest heart. At twenty-six, she marveled how time had been so kind, leaving no trace on her youthful beauty.

A woman blessed with such perfection had no business wallowing in self-doubt.

Lost in thought, Vivian absentmindedly placed her injured right foot on the chilly tiles. The thick plastic wrap protecting her wound had cut off circulation, leaving her leg frighteningly numb.

Her foot slipped the moment it touched the floor.

"Ah!" Her arms flailed wildly as gravity pulled her toward the unforgiving marble.

Just as she began her descent, the bathroom door flew open.

Adrian stood framed in the doorway, his tailored suit accentuating his broad shoulders. Their eyes met - his widening in surprise before he sprang into action.

Vivian gasped as strong arms scooped her up bridal-style, his grip unexpectedly tight around her waist.

Then came the horrifying realization - she wore nothing but droplets of water from her interrupted shower.

Heat flooded her cheeks as she instinctively crossed her arms over her chest. This marked their first intimate contact since their rushed wedding, and the awkwardness made her toes curl in embarrassment.

Adrian's lips quirked in amusement. "Relax, darling," he drawled. "There's hardly anything worth hiding."

Humiliation and irritation warred within her. "How generous of you, Mr. Blackwood," she snapped. "After your extensive experience, I'm sure my modest curves fail to impress."

Though Vivian carried her C-cup figure with quiet confidence, she knew all too well that without love, even the most perfect body meant nothing compared to Serena's willowy frame that Adrian so clearly preferred.

With practiced ease, Adrian grabbed the plush robe hanging behind the door and draped it over her shoulders. His brows furrowed at her comment. "What nonsense are you spouting now, Vivian?"

A sudden thought darkened his expression further. "Tell me," his voice turned dangerously calm, "did you send those divorce papers at midnight just to stage this little scene? To lure me home to find you like this?" His jaw tightened. "I told you I had back-to-back meetings. Was this desperate ploy really necessary?"

Vivian's temper flared at his accusatory tone, reigniting the simmering tension between them.

He always assumed the worst of her.

###Chapter 7

Vivian wasn't the kind of woman who threatened divorce casually.

In their two-year marriage, this was the first time the word had crossed her lips. Yet Adrian remained infuriatingly indifferent to her distress.

He brushed off her concerns as if she were making mountains out of molehills.

Despite the searing pain in her injured leg, Vivian gathered her strength. "Put me down," she demanded.

Adrian ignored her, his gaze fixed on the bandages wrapping her thigh.

His brow furrowed slightly. "What happened to your leg? Is this some desperate attempt to get my attention?"

A bitter laugh escaped Vivian's lips.

Of course he'd assume this was some pathetic scheme. In his eyes, she was just another attention-seeking wife who'd resorted to dramatics when ignored.

Her expression turned stony. "It's a cosmetic procedure. The wound can't get wet," she lied smoothly.

"Why would you suddenly need such treatment?" Adrian asked casually as he carried her outside, showing no real interest in her answer.

His broad frame dwarfed her. Through the thin fabric of his shirt, she could feel the heat radiating from his body, the hard planes of his chest muscles.

The intimate contact made Vivian stiffen. She'd come here to end things, not to be reminded of what she'd once craved.

Her voice turned sharp. "Since when do you care about such trivial matters, Mr. Blackwood?"

Adrian's lips twitched at her uncharacteristic sarcasm. He found it oddly amusing.

"You're my wife," he said calmly. "Naturally I'm concerned about your wellbeing."

"Really?" Vivian's tone turned somber. "You've never treated me like a wife. I could die tomorrow and you wouldn't notice until it was convenient."

The truth cut deep. At that very moment when she'd needed him most, Adrian had been preoccupied with his precious Serena, too busy to answer her desperate calls.

Caught off guard, Adrian's eyes widened before he let out a disbelieving chuckle. "Vivian, what's gotten into you? Because I missed one call this afternoon? Perhaps I've spoiled you too much lately, making you forget your place."

Vivian froze.

Her place?

The realization hit her like a physical blow. Their marriage had always been transactional - her freedom exchanged for his financial security.

She'd been the fool who broke the rules, who'd dared to fall in love.

In the cruel game of hearts, the one who loved first always lost.
###Chapter 8

Adrian's indifferent response sent shockwaves through Vivian, her feelings brushed aside like insignificant trifles. A suffocating tightness coiled around her chest.

"Put me down right now!" Vivian demanded sharply, twisting her body away. Her voice carried an unmistakable edge of irritation.

Adrian remained silent, effortlessly carrying her toward the luxurious bed before abruptly releasing his grip.

The sudden loss of support made Vivian's heart lurch. Instinctively, her hands flew out to grab him.

Their bodies tumbled onto the silk sheets together, her robe dangerously close to slipping open with the slightest movement.

Propped on one elbow, Adrian looked down at her with a teasing smirk. "You wanted me to let go, didn't you? Then why are you holding onto me now?"

His eyes, dark and mesmerizing like a star-filled midnight sky, held her captive.

In those fathomless depths, Vivian caught a fleeting glimpse of her own reflection.

Moments like these dangerously made her believe he might actually care.

But his heart remained an impenetrable fortress built for Serena, leaving Vivian with nothing but hollow daydreams.

"How predictable," she muttered flatly, attempting to sit up when her hand accidentally brushed against something unmistakable.

The atmosphere shifted instantly as his growing arousal pressed against her abdomen.

"Stay still," he warned in a dangerously low voice, "unless you want to see where this leads."

Vivian mentally cursed at his words.

It was an undeniable biological truth.

Men were driven by primal instincts.

Lack of love didn't extinguish basic desires.

Yet she knew better than to provoke Adrian further.

Turning her face away, her body remained tense, frozen in place.

Annoyed, Vivian shot back, "Didn't you claim there was nothing worth seeing here? What's this reaction about, Mr. Blackwood? Are you really that easily stimulated?"

The moment the words left her lips, she realized their dangerous implication.

Regret flooded through her, but instead of anger, Adrian responded with an amused chuckle.

"You are my wife after all. Since that's an unchangeable fact, I might as well make the most of it."

His fingers slipped beneath the silken folds of her robe, tracing the delicate curve of her waist with featherlight touches.

"Besides," he murmured, pulling her closer, "it's been years since our wedding night. Such neglect would be... wasteful."

His hand circled her slender frame with possessive certainty.

Vivian's face, a captivating mix of defiance and visible frustration, only fueled Adrian's desire to conquer her resistance.
###Chapter 9

His breathing deepened, yet he maintained perfect composure, methodically unbuttoning his custom-tailored jacket.

The fine wool brushed against Vivian's skin, releasing an intoxicating blend of masculine cologne - the familiar sandalwood base notes now tainted with an unmistakable citrusy top note.

It was that damned Creed Aventus - Serena's signature fragrance.

A wave of revulsion crashed over Vivian at the realization.

As Adrian's stormy gaze locked onto hers, the proximity conjured unwanted images of him tangled with Serena.

Her stomach lurched violently. With a sudden jerk, she shoved him away, scrambling upright as bile rose in her throat.

"Ugh."

Her empty stomach had nothing to offer but dry heaves.

The smoldering desire in Adrian's eyes extinguished instantly, replaced by glacial detachment as he withdrew.

Seeing Vivian's genuine distress - the red-rimmed eyes, the trembling lips - Adrian misinterpreted her reaction as pure disgust at his touch.

He straightened his cuffs with sharp precision, his voice dripping with venom. "Tell me, Vivian. Is this performance reserved solely for me, or do all men make you this physically ill?"

The atmosphere turned arctic, thick with unspoken accusations.

Vivian swallowed against the burning in her throat, staring at him in stunned disbelief.

She'd severed ties with every male acquaintance since their wedding, yet here stood Adrian, wielding words sharper than any blade.

All those years of devotion now seemed like the ultimate folly.

Heat flooded her cheeks as righteous anger took hold.

Before she could stop herself, her palm connected with Adrian's cheek in a resounding slap.

Every suppressed grievance of the past year fueled that single motion.

Her silk robe slipped from her shoulders in the commotion.

Ignoring the sudden exposure, she hastily gathered the fabric around herself with trembling fingers.

A faint red imprint bloomed on Adrian's chiseled cheekbone - her rage made visible.

His eyes widened in shock. "Have you lost your damn mind, Vivian?"

Lost her mind? Absolutely. Only a madwoman would have ever fallen for this man.

Vivian's pulse hammered in her ears as silent fury consumed her.

The shrill vibration of a phone on the nightstand sliced through the tension like a knife.

Adrian glanced at the screen, his jaw tightening. With one decisive motion, he silenced the device and turned toward the door, his posture rigid.

Her voice, steel wrapped in velvet, followed him. "I want those divorce papers signed before you walk out that door!"

Adrian paused just long enough to throw over his shoulder, "Business calls. When I return, you can have whatever the hell you want." The door slammed with finality behind him.
###Chapter 10

Vivian watched Adrian's retreating figure with a sinking heart, the weight of his departure pressing down on her like a physical force.

She ignored the sharp pain in her leg and limped toward her tablet, hands shaking as she pulled up Serena’s latest Instagram post.

The photo showed Serena sprawled across a plush couch, a cooling patch on her forehead, still wrapped in Adrian’s unmistakable leather jacket.

The caption read: "Fever dreams and loneliness. Wish someone were here to take care of me."

A second post followed immediately: "Stay warm, loves!"

The timing was too perfect to be coincidence.

Vivian’s stomach twisted.

Serena wasn’t just sick—she was playing a calculated game, tugging at Adrian’s protective instincts.

And it was working.

Not even Vivian’s threat of divorce had been enough to keep him from rushing to Serena’s side.

Fury burned through her, leaving her trembling like a leaf in a storm.

She refused to crumble.

With stiff fingers, she peeled the bandage from her leg, revealing the inflamed wound beneath.

The bath had soaked through the dressing, leaving the skin raw and swollen.

She could be needy too.

She had been, once—clinging to her grandmother after scalding herself with boiling water, sobbing into the woman’s embrace.

But vulnerability had its place, and this wasn’t it.

Adrian’s abandonment had stripped away any illusions.

She was on her own.

Gritting her teeth, she cleaned the wound with practiced efficiency and rewrapped it tightly.

Then she strode to her walk-in closet and dragged out an old suitcase—the one she’d arrived with, filled with nothing but hope.

She packed a fresh set of clothes and left a single bank card on the nightstand.

Every cent she’d earned in the past year was on it.

A clean break.

No debts.

No ties.

She hauled the suitcase behind her, wincing with every step as she left Seabreeze Villa behind.

The night air was sharp, the early spring chill biting through her thin jacket.

But the cold outside was nothing compared to the ice spreading through her chest.

She didn’t look back.
###Chapter 11

The suitcase felt heavier than it should as Vivian Hartley dragged it across the marble floor of the penthouse. She had arrived at Crestwood with nothing but dreams and this single piece of luggage. Now she was leaving with neither.

A humorless laugh escaped her lips.

If only she hadn't fallen so deeply for him. If only she'd stuck to their original agreement - one year of marriage, then a clean break. But no, she had to go and lose her heart to Adrian Blackwood.

Serena Whitmore hadn't even needed to lift a finger. Vivian had destroyed herself all on her own.

Across town, the Mirage Lounge pulsed with energy. The most exclusive club in Crestwood was hosting its most elite guests tonight in the VIP section.

The air smelled of expensive perfume and ambition as the city's elite lounged on velvet couches, their laughter mingling with the bass-heavy music.

Then the door swung open.

Adrian stood framed in the doorway, his presence immediately silencing the room. "Blackwood!" several voices called out in greeting.

Before anyone could say more, a slender figure stepped out from behind him.

Serena removed her wide-brimmed hat with practiced grace, revealing her delicate features. She slipped her arm through Adrian's with the ease of long familiarity.

"My assistant had a family emergency," she explained with an apologetic smile. "I didn't want to spend the evening alone, so I convinced Adrian to join me. I hope that's alright?"

The room's occupants exchanged glances. Serena was undeniably beautiful - her porcelain skin, rosebud lips, and large doe eyes gave her an almost ethereal quality. Next to Vivian's striking, bold beauty, Serena was like a delicate watercolor painting.

But everyone here knew the truth. While Adrian and Vivian were legally married, theirs was a marriage in name only. Adrian never included his wife in these private gatherings.

After an awkward beat, the host recovered first. "Of course! The more the merrier!" He gestured them toward the center of the room where the best seats had been reserved.

As they made their way through the parting crowd, the host pressed a crystal glass of champagne into Adrian's hand. "We owe you big time for today, Blackwood. That negotiation was masterful. Without you, we'd never have landed the PrimeCart deal!"

Tonight's celebration marked the successful launch of their new e-commerce platform, a project that had been in development for months. The contracts signed today would make them all very wealthy men.

Vivian knew none of this as she stepped into the elevator, her suitcase the only witness to her quiet exit. The doors slid shut with finality, carrying her away from the life she'd foolishly dreamed could be hers.
###Chapter 12

The business landscape shifted overnight when PrimeCart made its move, sending shockwaves through the industry.

Going up against PrimeCart was like a sparrow challenging an eagle—utterly futile.

In their desperation, they reached out to Adrian Blackwood, pulling every string in Dominic Sinclair’s vast social network to secure his legendary strategic brilliance.

With his signature precision, Adrian devised an audacious plan and swooped in at the eleventh hour, snatching the deal right from under PrimeCart’s nose—mere moments before the contract could be signed.

The sheer audacity of the maneuver left the entire business world reeling.

Dominic Sinclair, grinning with pride, raised his glass. "Now that’s the kind of ally you want on your side. They thought they could outmaneuver us? Clearly, they underestimated Adrian’s influence."

Dominic, heir to the Sinclair fortune, was one of Adrian’s oldest confidants.

His connections were legendary—a sprawling web of power and privilege that had delivered the desperate plea straight to Adrian’s doorstep.

Meanwhile, Adrian himself lounged on the plush sofa, bathed in the soft golden glow of the chandelier above.

He was no stranger to admiration, so his expression remained cool, detached—almost bored.

The light sculpted his sharp features, casting shadows that accentuated the regal line of his nose and the hard angle of his jaw, as if he were carved from marble.

His effortless elegance made everyone else in the room seem dull in comparison.

After a round of celebratory toasts, when it became clear Adrian had barely touched his drink, the others lowered their voices, granting him a moment of quiet repose.

Serena Whitmore, flushed from the warmth of the room but abstaining from alcohol, sat beside him in serene silence, her gaze lingering on him with unmistakable devotion.

Dominic, watching the pair, couldn’t help but marvel at how perfectly matched they seemed.

Casually, he snapped a photo of them and uploaded it to his social media without a second thought.

As the night wore on and the liquor dwindled, the door swung open once more.

Ethan Caldwell, Adrian’s personal assistant, stepped inside with a polite nod—respectful but never obsequious—before positioning himself in front of Adrian.

The room fell silent.

Serena, unable to resist, leaned in and whispered, "What’s happening?"

Ethan ignored her, his attention fixed solely on Adrian.

A faint blush crept up her cheeks as she turned to Adrian, hesitating before murmuring, "Should I… leave?"


###Chapter 13

Adrian shifted slightly in his seat, his deep voice measured. "Proceed."

Ethan felt a nervous tremor run down his spine as he began hesitantly. "Mr. Blackwood, Mrs. Blackwood has left Seabreeze Villa, and—"

Serena's champagne flute paused halfway to her lips, a flicker of confusion crossing her features.

Dominic leaned in with a knowing smirk. "So you left your wife home alone while you're out with Serena? That's cold, man. Women need attention, you know."

Known among their circle as the relationship expert, Dominic had navigated countless romantic entanglements with his silver tongue and quick wit.

With a casual wave of his hand, he suggested, "Why don't we hit Opal Galleria later? My family's boutique just got an exclusive Chanel clutch from their spring collection. That should smooth things over."

Adrian remained impassive, simply gesturing for Ethan to continue. "Go on."

Ethan swallowed hard before speaking. "Mrs. Blackwood left behind the bank card—the one you gave her when you first married."

Adrian's gaze dropped to his phone, his thick lashes casting shadows that seemed to lower the temperature in the room.

His fingers moved swiftly across the screen as he accessed the banking app linked to the card.

The transaction history appeared before him.

Two years ago: a withdrawal of two million.

Exactly one year later: the same amount redeposited.

And most shockingly—a deposit of twenty million made mere hours ago.

This meant Vivian hadn't touched a single cent beyond the initial withdrawal.

Not only had she returned the original sum, but she'd now added an astonishing twenty million to the account.

Adrian's brow furrowed as he muttered, "Where the hell did she get that kind of money?"

His mind raced through Vivian's daily routine—decorating their penthouse, experimenting with new recipes, shopping for his wardrobe.

Though she'd signed with Ivory Phoenix Productions, she'd attended only one audition before refusing all other offers.

Adrian had been forced to send Ethan to intervene with her agent to avoid breach penalties.

Someone with her lifestyle shouldn't have been capable of amassing twenty million independently.

And if she possessed both the ability and ambition to earn that much, why would she have agreed to their marriage of convenience for a mere two million?

Ethan bowed his head in contrition. "My apologies, sir. This oversight is unacceptable. I'll investigate Mrs. Blackwood's financial activities immediately."

Dominic nudged Adrian with his elbow, his tone dripping with mock sympathy. "Don't tell me you got dumped, Blackwood. I've always said—neglect a woman long enough, and she'll find comfort in someone else's—"

###Chapter 14

The tension in the room was palpable as Dominic Sinclair realized his blunder.

Adrian Blackwood's icy glare made the air turn frigid.

Only then did Dominic notice Serena Whitmore still standing there, her presence forgotten in the heat of the moment.

A quick glance confirmed Serena's smile had frozen into something brittle.

"My bad!" Dominic exclaimed dramatically, slapping his forehead and miming zipping his mouth shut.

Serena turned to Adrian, her delicate fingers curling around his forearm. "Did I somehow cause trouble between you and Vivian?" she offered softly. "I'd be happy to explain things to her if that would help."

Adrian's brow furrowed deeply. "Why would this concern you?" His confusion was evident.

Dominic, despite his earlier promise, couldn't stay silent. "Good heavens, Adrian! Have you been living under a rock? Haven't you seen the trending headlines? It's obvious why she's upset!"

Serena ventured carefully, "Could it be... those paparazzi photos of you helping me? The tabloids spun it into something scandalous. I tried to contain the rumors immediately, but with our public profiles..." Her voice trailed off, heavy with unspoken apology.

Adrian's expression softened unexpectedly. "This isn't your fault," he reassured her, his tone surprisingly gentle.

His gaze then shifted to Ethan Caldwell, who already trembled under Adrian's steel-eyed stare.

"I've been handling Ms. Whitmore's affairs all day and missed the viral news," Ethan admitted nervously. "I'll take care of this immediately." He hurried off to manage the crisis.

Serena fidgeted with her sleeve, watching Adrian with anxious eyes. "Adrian... am I causing you trouble?" she whispered.

Adrian set his phone down deliberately. "This isn't about you," he stated calmly. "She's just throwing a tantrum because she's angry with me. Where else would she go without me? I expect her to come crawling back any moment now with her suitcases."

One of Adrian's companions scoffed, raising his glass. "Marrying someone like Mr. Blackwood is the opportunity of a lifetime! Getting upset over nothing? Women need to learn their place!" The group murmured in agreement.

"Exactly! Too much leniency," another added, swirling his drink.

"With Mr. Blackwood's status - a few rumors or even affairs are hardly worth mentioning, right? What woman would willingly give up being Mrs. Blackwood and demand a divorce?"

Dominic opened his mouth to comment when an interruption came.

"Which one of you is Mr. Adrian Blackwood?"
###Chapter 15

The sudden knock at the door made everyone turn. A delivery man in his blue uniform stood awkwardly in the doorway, holding a thick envelope.

Dominic raised an eyebrow. "Did someone order food?"

A series of shaking heads answered him. Phones were waved as proof. "Not me."

"Must be a wrong delivery," someone suggested, though their eyes gleamed with curiosity. "Unless someone's trying to impress Mr. Blackwood? I wonder what's inside."

The delivery man scanned the document in his hands. "Divorce papers from Ms. Vivian Hartley, to be delivered directly to Mr. Adrian Blackwood."

The air in the room turned to ice.

The cheerful atmosphere shattered like dropped crystal.

Eyes darted between faces before everyone suddenly found their drinks fascinating.

Only Dominic dared to move.

He took the folder and tossed it toward Adrian with a dramatic flourish. "What the hell did you do, man? She's not playing games," he said, though his usual smirk was absent.

Dominic burned with curiosity about the contents, but even he knew better than to peek.

The embossed law firm logo on the envelope screamed "serious business."

Adrian's face darkened under the dim lighting, shadows clinging to his sharp features like ink.

He ignored the folder entirely.

Instead, he grabbed the nearest whiskey bottle - a rare 1972 Macallan worth a small fortune - and poured a generous amount into his glass.

The amber liquid disappeared in one swift motion.

When he set the bottle down carelessly, half its remaining contents splashed onto the polished floor.

Dominic winced at the waste but wisely kept silent.

No one moved to clean the spill.

The clink of Adrian's empty glass against the table was deafening in the silence.

"All this over one missed call?" His voice was dangerously calm, edged with something darker.

The room held its breath.

Even the usual background noise of the restaurant seemed to fade away.

Serena straightened her posture and gently removed the glass from Adrian's hand. "This is my fault," she whispered, her delicate fingers trembling slightly. "If my heart condition hadn't acted up again..."

"If I wasn't so weak, if those fevers didn't keep coming back, you wouldn't have missed her call."

Tears welled up in her large, expressive eyes, making them shine like liquid silver.

She pressed a hand to her chest, the picture of fragile beauty. "My health has always been a burden to you. Ms. Hartley called multiple times this afternoon. It must have been urgent."

Her voice broke on the last word, the perfect picture of remorse.

The tension in the room thickened.

Adrian's jaw clenched as he stared at the unopened folder like it might burst into flames.

No one dared to speak.

Not even Dominic.

The only sound was the distant clinking of silverware from the restaurant kitchen.

And the slow, deliberate tap of Adrian's fingers against the whiskey glass.

Waiting.

Always waiting.
###Chapter 16

Adrian's mind briefly drifted to Vivian's poised elegance before he responded with icy detachment. "What could possibly be so urgent? I saw her earlier tonight, and she seemed perfectly fine."

Dominic, struck by sudden realization, interjected sharply. "Are you both really this oblivious to the news? This afternoon, you said?" His tone grew grave. "There was a breaking report about an explosion in the historic district downtown. If I recall correctly, wasn't there an apartment Vivian inherited from her mother in that area?"

With swift precision, Dominic handed his smartphone to Adrian.

The incident had made headlines across Crestwood's media outlets.

Initial reports suggested the blast was caused by faulty wiring, worsened by a local family's stockpile of cooking gas for their restaurant—resulting in a devastating explosion.

Adrian's gaze flickered over the disturbing images, a shadow of unease crossing his features.

But then he remembered his encounter with Vivian earlier that evening—how unharmed she had been, even matching him in their verbal sparring. The tension in his shoulders eased slightly as he dismissed the idea of her being involved.

Dominic hesitated, studying Adrian's impassive expression before cautiously adding, "Adrian, that apartment was the last thing her mother left her. It held sentimental value. Of course she'd be distraught over losing it. And after reaching out to you in desperation, only to find you unavailable…" He exhaled. "With the rumors about you and Serena circulating, her reaction isn't surprising."

He leaned in slightly. "You're still married. If divorce isn't on the table, maybe an apology would be the right move."

Adrian scoffed, his voice dripping with disdain. "Sentimentality doesn't justify hysterics. A building is just property—it can't compare to human lives. Even knowing all this, I'd still prioritize taking Serena to the hospital. If Vivian had any real compassion, she wouldn't be making this about herself." His lips curled. "An apology? She owes me one, not the other way around."

Dominic fell silent, taken aback by Adrian's harsh dismissal.

He pressed his lips together, took a slow sip of his wine, then shook his head slightly before returning to the evening's festivities as if the conversation had never happened.

After a few more rounds, Dominic noticed Adrian's restless glances toward his phone.

With an exasperated sigh, he suggested, "Look, if Vivian's being difficult, I'll call her myself and smooth things over. Alright?"

"Do what you want," Adrian muttered, his tone indifferent as he cast a dismissive glance at Dominic.

Without hesitation, Dominic grabbed Adrian's phone, scrolled to Vivian's contact, and pressed call.

The room fell into heavy silence, thick with anticipation.

The line rang once, twice—then cut abruptly to a busy signal.

Unfazed, Dominic tried again.

One ring.

Then silence.

He attempted a third time.

Same result.

The calls kept ending before they could connect.


###Chapter 17

Dominic's cheeks burned with humiliation as he ran a hand through his hair, attempting to disguise his irritation. "You know how women are. Sometimes they need space. Let me try one last time."

He pressed the call button again, hope flickering in his gaze, only to be greeted by the robotic voice of an automated system. "The number you're trying to reach is unavailable—"

The realization hit him like a tidal wave. Dominic carefully placed the phone down and took several steps back from Adrian.

The truth was undeniable—Vivian had blocked Adrian's number.

Adrian's piercing stare remained fixed on the silent device, his jaw clenched tight.

A storm of emotions raged behind his eyes—betrayal mixing with barely contained fury.

The festive mood of Adrian's gathering had been destroyed when the unexpected divorce papers arrived by courier.

Adrian had just returned from seeing Serena home, the night fully embracing the city.

Ethan, seated in the front passenger seat, turned with concern etched on his features. "Mr. Blackwood, where should we go tonight?"

Adrian's first thought was Seabreeze Villa, but the memory of Vivian sent a fresh wave of pain through him.

"Take me to Blackwood Manor," he commanded, his voice like ice.

Ethan nodded in silent understanding.

The driver immediately changed course toward the imposing gates of the Blackwood estate.

At dawn the next morning, Ethan and the chauffeur arrived to collect Adrian once more.

Sitting pensively in the backseat, Adrian listened as Ethan reviewed the day's schedule, his steady voice cutting through the morning quiet.

Midway through, Ethan hesitated, his sudden silence drawing Adrian's attention.

"Is there something you're not telling me?" Adrian demanded.

Ethan cleared his throat nervously. "Mr. Blackwood, there's an urgent contract in Crystalpeak that requires your signature tomorrow."

Adrian raised an eyebrow. "It's just an overnight trip. Pack a few essentials. What's the issue?"

With visible discomfort, Ethan explained, "Your travel preparations were always handled by Mrs. Blackwood. She took care of everything—your wardrobe, toiletries, all the details."

The staff had attempted to fill this role on occasion, but their efforts never matched Vivian's impeccable standards—standards Adrian had come to expect.

A shadow crossed Adrian's face at the mention of his wife.

After a moment's hesitation, Ethan cautiously suggested, "Should I contact Mrs. Blackwood to assist with—"

Adrian's glare cut him off mid-sentence.

The tension in the car became palpable.

Ethan immediately dropped the subject, realizing his mistake.

The remainder of the ride passed in heavy silence.

Adrian stared out the window, his mind racing with conflicting thoughts.

The cityscape blurred past as the car moved steadily toward its destination.

Each passing building seemed to mock him with memories of what he'd lost.

The weight of Vivian's absence pressed down on him more heavily than he cared to admit.

His fingers tightened around the armrest as frustration built within him.

Ethan wisely kept his eyes forward, giving his employer space.

The morning sun cast long shadows across the pavement as they arrived at the office.

Adrian stepped out of the car, his expression unreadable.

The day stretched before him, filled with meetings and obligations.

Yet his thoughts kept returning to one unavoidable truth—Vivian had walked away.

And he had no idea how to get her back.
###Chapter 18

The car was thick with silence as Adrian turned his face toward the window, his subtle gesture speaking volumes to Ethan after their years of working together.

It was Adrian's silent way of giving Vivian space to fix things between them.

Ethan took a steadying breath before dialing Vivian's number.

The line rang with an eerie melody before her voice sliced through, colder than he'd ever heard. "Yes?"

The frost in her tone was a shocking departure from her usual warmth, mirroring the icy demeanor Adrian often displayed.

Choosing his words carefully while watching Adrian's impassive profile, Ethan began, "Mrs. Blackwood... Mr. Blackwood has a business trip tomorrow. Would you be able to pack his things?"

Meanwhile at the hotel, Vivian jolted awake at the ringing phone, her voice dripping with disbelief and bitterness. "Didn't he receive the divorce papers yesterday?"

Though their marriage had been one of convenience, Vivian had thrown herself into the role completely.

Now Ethan's request made her feel like nothing more than hired help in Adrian's world.

Once, her love for Adrian had made such tasks feel meaningful, even sweet.

But with divorce papers signed, Vivian couldn't fathom why she'd continue playing the devoted wife.

Her morning irritation, fueled by resentment toward Adrian, exploded violently.

She snapped sarcastically at Ethan, "You're employed by Blackwood Group, so comprehension shouldn't be an issue. Must I explain what divorce means? Once finalized, your boss and I are strangers. Contacting me now is as absurd as asking a random pedestrian for help. Can't your precious boss find someone to pack his bags? If it's truly that difficult, tell him to throw money at the problem - it's not like he's short on cash!"

"Mrs. Blackwood, I—" Ethan tried to interject, but Vivian abruptly ended the call, leaving him stunned. His next attempt to call back was blocked.

"Mr. Blackwood..." Ethan turned to Adrian, his voice laced with unease.

The car plunged into tense silence, the sharp exchange still vibrating in the air.

Adrian's expression remained unreadable in the dim light, his sharp features half-obscured by shadows. "I heard every word," he replied icily, his gaze glinting like frozen lake under winter sun.

On the other end, Vivian, now fully awake from the call, decided to get up.

She checked her bank balance and immediately regretted transferring most of her savings to Adrian in a moment of weakness.

She scolded herself for not keeping at least a million aside for emergencies.

Between rent, living expenses, and her grandmother's mounting medical bills, the financial pressure was crushing.

Over the past year, she'd neglected her acting career and made little progress on her screenplay side project.

Inspiration had been elusive, and polishing a script required time she no longer had.
###Chapter 19

Vivian's fingers trembled slightly as she applied the last stroke of mascara. The reflection in the mirror showed a woman reborn - not the brokenhearted divorcee from yesterday, but a determined artist ready to reclaim her place in the spotlight.

A miracle had happened last night. Lydia Bennett, her former agent, had actually agreed to meet after all these years.

"Vivian?"

The crisp knock at her apartment door made her jump. That voice - sharper now, more authoritative - still carried traces of the eager young agent she once knew.

She swung the door open to find a vision of corporate chic. The Lydia standing before her wore a slate-gray power suit that screamed success, her once-round cheeks now sculpted into razor-sharp cheekbones. This was no longer the struggling agent who'd taken a chance on an unknown actress.

Back when Lydia first signed Vivian, she'd been a nobody in the industry. "My first real protégé," Lydia had gushed, eyes shining with dreams of their shared future.

How quickly things changed.

Within two years, Lydia became the agent everyone wanted, launching fresh faces into stardom while Vivian... Vivian had chosen love over career, frozen in time like some tragic heroine from a period drama.

"Lydia." Vivian stepped aside, gesturing toward the plush armchair. "Please."

Lydia swept in, her designer heels clicking like a metronome counting down Vivian's humiliation. "So the fairytale ending didn't work out?" The words dripped with acid. "No happily ever after playing house with your rich husband? What was it you told me? 'He hates the spotlight'?" She made air quotes with manicured fingers. "Funny how you come crawling back now that the money's gone."

The truth stung. Vivian had barely begun working with Lydia before meeting Maxwell. Their professional relationship had been brief, their personal connection practically nonexistent. When Vivian announced her departure, she'd painted a picture of domestic bliss - a wealthy husband who wanted her all to himself.

Lydia had seen right through it.

Now here they were, two years later, with Vivian's marriage in ashes and her career nonexistent. That desperate midnight phone call still burned in her memory - the choked confession, the humiliating plea for help.

Lydia's expression said it all: This was charity. Only Vivian's striking beauty and that brief, shining potential from years ago had earned her this meeting.

Vivian swallowed the lump in her throat as Lydia's verbal lashing continued. Every word was deserved. Every syllable a reminder of her colossal mistakes.

The past couldn't be changed. But the future? That was still hers to write.
###Chapter 20

The weight of Vivian's silence filled the room like thick smoke.

Lydia Bennett studied her protégé's downcast expression while lighting a cigarette with practiced elegance.

Crossing her slender legs, the seasoned agent exhaled a slow stream of smoke. "I had such grand visions for your future."

She tapped her manicured nails against the armrest. "With your striking features and raw acting talent, stardom was practically guaranteed."

A bitter laugh escaped her lips. "Yet what did you choose? Before your first leading role, before your name ever graced a theater marquee - you threw it all away for romance."

Lydia's sharp gaze swept across the modest hotel room. "Did you ever consider the realities of marrying into the Blackwood dynasty? It might have been different if Adrian had actually married you, but now..."

Vivian's hands trembled visibly, her knuckles whitening around the fabric of her dress.

"Remember Serena Whitmore?" Lydia continued mercilessly. "The woman who stole your breakout role? She didn't have half your talent or beauty, yet she persevered."

She leaned forward, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "Even after securing Adrian Blackwood as her partner, she never stopped working. Now she picks roles at will between films and television."

Vivian flinched at the mention of Adrian and Serena, the familiar ache blooming in her chest.

"You could have surpassed her," Lydia pressed. "With your potential, you should be the one choosing projects now."

Lowering her eyes, Vivian released her death grip on the fabric. "You're right, Lydia," she murmured, her voice steadier than expected. "I was blinded by love, but I see clearly now. My career deserves my full dedication. Let's leave my mistakes in the past."

Lydia arched a perfectly sculpted brow. "And if love comes knocking again?"

Vivian raised her hand in solemn vow. "I swear on my career, it won't happen again."

A satisfied smirk played at Lydia's lips as she stubbed out her cigarette.

For hours, Lydia put Vivian through rigorous acting exercises, testing her range with various roles. Relief washed over the agent as she confirmed Vivian's talent remained undiminished.

Before leaving, Lydia delivered her final instructions. "With your looks and skills, we won't settle for mediocre roles. But remember - you're rebuilding from scratch. I'll find you auditions, even in smaller productions. Hone your craft, Vivian. Don't make me regret this."

Vivian nodded, determination shining in her emerald eyes.

Lydia allowed herself a rare, genuine smile as she closed the door. She'd always believed in Vivian Hartley's star power - now it was time to prove the entire entertainment world wrong.
###Chapter 21

Vivian stretched across the plush hotel bed, her fingers tracing the pages of a well-worn acting manual. The afternoon sunlight streamed through sheer curtains, casting golden patterns on the leather-bound text.

Her phone vibrated violently against the nightstand, Lydia's contact photo flashing urgently.

"Vivian!" Lydia's voice crackled with excitement through the speaker. "Drop everything! I just secured you an audition for 'Crimson Tides' - the most anticipated drama this season! They're specifically seeking undiscovered talent with that special spark."

Vivian's pulse quickened as she scanned the project details flooding her inbox.

This wasn't just any role - it was a complex, morally ambiguous lead in a gritty metropolitan thriller. A character worlds apart from her usual typecast as the girl-next-door.

The perfect opportunity to reinvent herself after the messy divorce from Adrian and that whole Serena debacle.

For three sleepless nights, Vivian dissected the script until the margins brimmed with handwritten notes. The character's lines wove through her dreams, often jolting her awake with sudden epiphanies about delivery and motivation.

Audition day arrived with an unseasonal downpour. Vivian's taxi splashed through puddles toward the Harbor Grand Hotel just as a sleek black limousine glided under the porte-cochère.

A shrieking mob of fans materialized instantly, smartphones raised like offerings to some unseen deity.

Through the rain-streaked window, Vivian's breath caught.

Of course. Serena Whitmore.

The pop princess emerged in a cloud of bodyguards and assistants, her signature platinum waves perfectly untouched by the weather. The screaming intensified as she disappeared through revolving doors.

"Must be some celebrity," the cab driver chuckled, counting Vivian's payment. "Though between us? You've got ten times her natural charm."

Vivian offered a polite smile, adjusting her tailored blazer as she stepped into the storm. Unlike Serena's grand entrance, her own passage went largely unnoticed - save for a few curious whispers.

"Is she an actress?"
"That bone structure can't be real..."
"Someone get her agent's number!"

Lydia materialized with an umbrella, steering Vivian toward the elevators. "Director Sterling's running late," she murmured. "Use the extra time to center yourself."

The conference room hummed with nervous energy when they arrived. Dozens of hopefuls clutched scripts, their eyes darting between the door and their competition.

Vivian took a steadying breath. This was her moment - not just to prove herself as an actress, but to finally step out of everyone's shadows.

Somewhere beyond the soundproof walls, Serena's laughter echoed through the hotel corridors.

The universe had a cruel sense of humor.
###Chapter 22

The audition waiting room buzzed with nervous energy as early arrivals clustered in small groups.

Vivian Hartley stepped through the doors, her entrance causing an immediate hush to fall over the space. Every head turned toward the unfamiliar beauty who carried herself with quiet confidence.

Among the sea of stunning actresses vying for the lead role, Vivian stood out like a diamond among rhinestones. The other women exchanged wary glances, their competitive instincts flaring at the sight of such formidable competition.

"Who is she?" someone whispered behind a script.

"Never seen her before," came the hissed reply. "Probably another pretty face with no real experience."

The murmurs grew louder as more actresses joined in the speculation. Their dismissive tones suggested Vivian was just another hopeful trying to luck into a big break without putting in the work.

Then the atmosphere shifted dramatically when Serena Whitmore made her grand entrance, surrounded by her usual entourage.

All eyes immediately darted between the two women, noting the brief but charged moment when Serena's gaze locked onto Vivian before deliberately looking away. The unspoken tension crackled through the room.

Several actresses quickly repositioned themselves near Serena, their voices dripping with false sweetness.

"Serena, darling, we all know this role was written for you," gushed one, flipping her hair. "The rest of us are just here to make the selection process look fair."

"Absolutely," another chimed in. "Though it seems some people actually believe they stand a chance against you." Her pointed glance at Vivian didn't go unnoticed.

Laughter rippled through the group as more joined in the thinly veiled insults. "Maybe she thinks looking pretty is enough? Has she even acted before?"

"At best she could play some vapid supporting character," someone sneered. "She certainly doesn't have Serena's commanding screen presence."

Vivian remained composed under the barrage of cattiness, though her grip tightened slightly on her script. Lydia opened her mouth to retaliate, but Vivian gave a nearly imperceptible shake of her head.

The message was clear: they wouldn't give these women the satisfaction of a reaction. The real competition would happen on the audition floor, not in petty backstage drama.
###Chapter 23

Vivian's gaze lifted to meet Serena's.

By some cosmic coincidence, Serena was already staring back at her.

Their eyes locked, and a knowing smirk played on Serena's perfectly painted lips.

At that exact moment, a production assistant clutching a clipboard called from the doorway, "Number 7, Vivian Hartley, you're next."

Vivian neatly folded her script and stood with effortless grace.

Approaching the door, she paused deliberately and spoke with measured sarcasm. "How fascinating to find myself in what appears to be a psychic convention, where everyone claims to predict acting talent and star potential from mere appearances. While beauty may be superficial, I'll gladly accept the compliments nonetheless."

Normally, Vivian paid little attention to her appearance, but today's relentless comparisons with Serena had worn thin her patience.

With calculated venom, she added, "Truthfully, I find your jealousy far more flattering than any admirer's praise could ever be."

With a flawless exit, Vivian swept out alongside Lydia, leaving the room's occupants stunned into silence as they watched her departure.

Inside the audition room, as Vivian entered with Lydia, both the director and screenwriter were immediately captivated by her presence.

Even among Hollywood's brightest stars, Vivian possessed that rare, luminous quality that commanded attention.

Her beauty wasn't merely striking - it was paired with an innate elegance that made her seem almost otherworldly.

She was the living, breathing incarnation of the screenplay's heroine.

The screenwriter chuckled in delight, "It's as if our protagonist stepped right out of the script - what a shame the author isn't here to witness this."

Lydia, recognizing the excitement in his voice, gave Vivian's arm an encouraging squeeze, signaling her to begin.

After a concise introduction, Vivian prepared to immerse herself in the role.

Suddenly, Julian Montoya, the confirmed male lead, made an unannounced entrance. "I'll be reading with her today," he declared with confident charm.

Though momentarily startled, Vivian's sharp instincts took over, allowing her to adapt seamlessly.

She realized this was likely a deliberate test by the production team to evaluate the actors' ability to handle unexpected challenges.

With this understanding, Vivian composed herself instantly.

The highly anticipated audition began with electric energy.

Within moments, Vivian transformed completely, matching Julian's intensity beat for beat.

Their chemistry was undeniable, their interactions flowing with natural ease.

Impressed by her quick thinking, Julian threw her a challenging glance and improvised a line, introducing conflict into what was meant to be a peaceful scene conclusion.

Vivian hesitated for only a heartbeat before masterfully steering the scene back on course, turning a potential misstep into a brilliant character moment.

"Magnificent! That's a wrap!" The director leapt from his chair behind the camera, applauding enthusiastically. "Despite Julian's attempts to complicate matters, Vivian's sharp instincts and quick thinking were extraordinary. That was better than the original script. Perhaps we should rewrite to incorporate this inspired improvisation?"
###Chapter 24

The room burst into spontaneous applause.

Even Julian Montoya, usually so reserved, stepped forward to hand Vivian a tissue with genuine admiration. "Absolutely breathtaking!" Julian was renowned as the most gifted among the new generation of actors, constantly pushing his craft to new heights.

Previous actresses who'd auditioned opposite him had crumbled under his unpredictable intensity.

His patience had been wearing thin with each disappointing session.

Vivian's raw, authentic performance reignited his passion for the craft.

Exchanging relieved glances, both Vivian and Lydia let out breaths they hadn't realized they'd been holding.

The director approached Vivian with warm appreciation. "Thank you for that extraordinary performance today. We'll be in touch regardless of the outcome."

Meanwhile, Serena Whitmore happened to glance up just as Vivian and Lydia stepped into the elevator, their cheerful chatter floating through the lobby.

A shadow of concern flickered across Serena's face before she turned to her manager. "Miranda, could you discreetly inquire about Vivian's audition?"

Miranda Graves scoffed, eyeing the closing elevator doors with disdain. "Why waste your energy? She's a nobody without connections. For a role this significant, no director would risk an unknown. With you in contention, it's unthinkable they'd choose anyone else - unless they've completely lost their senses."

Serena's worried expression lingered for a heartbeat before nodding, somewhat reassured by Miranda's logic.

Her thoughts were interrupted when a production assistant called her name, forcing her to shelve her concerns about Vivian for now.

Julian's unexpected presence during her audition threw Serena slightly off-balance.

She felt her performance lacked its usual sparkle in his formidable presence, though she doubted it would significantly impact her chances.

The production team's lukewarm response afterward left her unsettled.

"Thank you for your time, Ms. Whitmore. We'll notify you of our decision," came the polite but distant dismissal.

Serena's perfectly arched brows drew together in confusion at their indifferent reaction.

Noticing her client's distress and Julian fetching water nearby, Miranda flashed a practiced smile. "Mr. Montoya, what did you think of Serena's performance today?"

"Ms. Whitmore is always a professional," Julian replied, his compliment carrying a distinct reserve that Miranda's sharp ears immediately detected.

With decades in the industry, Miranda recognized the subtle shift in atmosphere instantly.

Someone else had clearly captured the production team's favor.

Exchanging curt pleasantries, Miranda guided Serena from the building, her expression turning grave the moment they were alone.

As Serena's audition concluded, the exhausted team welcomed their scheduled break.

###Chapter 25

The director flipped through his audition notes with a thoughtful expression. His fingers paused mid-page. "Honestly, if we hadn't witnessed Vivian's performance today, Serena's audition might have stood out more. She's currently trending everywhere, and her social media influence is massive."

Serena wasn't just any candidate.

She was the director's personal choice for the female lead.

At the height of her fame, she was every producer's dream casting - guaranteed to bring in viewers.

The director leaned back, considering giving her another shot.

Julian, who had been silently observing, finally spoke. "We must remember this drama is based on a bestselling novel series with millions of devoted fans. Casting decisions should honor the source material above star power."

The screenwriter nodded vigorously. "Precisely. Book adaptations come with built-in challenges. The readers are our harshest critics. Nailing the female lead is make-or-break for this project."

His mind drifted to Vivian. "The moment Vivian walked in, she became the character I'd envisioned while writing. Her interpretation was startlingly authentic - far beyond Serena's performance."

"Serena had the script a full week in advance," he continued, "yet her delivery was barely adequate. Is it lack of preparation or limited range?"

From the agent's earlier reaction, the latter seemed more likely.

Miranda had been pacing outside the waiting area for what felt like hours before cornering a harried production assistant.

With a smooth exchange and a designer gift bag, she extracted crucial information about the ongoing deliberations.

"What? They're actually considering Vivian for the lead?" Miranda gasped, her manicured nails digging into her palms.

Serena's perfect composure faltered for just a second.

Miranda's brow furrowed. "Do you think this is deliberate? With her messy divorce from Mr. Blackwood pending, is she trying to steal this role from you out of spite?"

"Perhaps not," Serena murmured, her teeth worrying her lower lip. "But if their separation involves me... then her resentment makes sense. If she wants this role that badly, she should have it. It's a shame though - I truly connected with the character."

Despite her gracious words, disappointment flickered across her delicate features.

Miranda placed a comforting hand on her shoulder. "Serena, you're too kind! Remember, Vivian was the one who came between you and Mr. Blackwood. She owes you an apology!"

"And think of everything you've sacrificed for this role - even your health! I'm the only one who knows how much you've suffered. You deserve this part - why should you step aside for her?"

With sudden determination, Miranda pulled out her phone.

Serena looked alarmed. "Miranda! You're not calling Adrian about this, are you? Don't drag him into something so trivial!"
###Chapter 26

"Don't trouble yourself about it." Miranda brushed off Serena's hand with a dismissive wave, turning slightly as she scrolled through her contacts to find Adrian's number.

Serena didn't protest further.

She simply stepped back, watching Miranda's poised posture while listening intently, a knowing smirk playing at the corners of her lips.

Within moments, Adrian's cool, detached voice came through the speaker. "Yes? What is it?"

After a calculated pause, Miranda explained, "Mr. Blackwood, we need to discuss Serena's situation. She's been pushing herself relentlessly for this audition, barely sleeping, to the point where her cardiac condition has flared up again. She's made several discreet hospital visits without informing most people. About the role—"

Adrian immediately latched onto the crucial detail. "Hospital? Why wasn't I notified?"

Miranda detected the shift in his tone and adjusted her approach accordingly. "Mr. Blackwood, Serena didn't want to burden you unnecessarily. But truly, it's nothing critical. You know how fragile her health can be. Even minor stress aggravates her condition, and she always minimizes it."

She allowed a strategic silence before steering the conversation back. "The real concern is how passionately she wants this role. With her credentials, she seemed the obvious choice, but unexpectedly, the producers changed their minds, and now—"

Adrian, ever perceptive, caught her implication instantly. "From now on, inform me immediately about any developments. Tell Serena to rest and not worry."

"The lead role is hers without question. I'll visit her personally when I return to Crestwood."

"Understood. Thank you for your generosity, Mr. Blackwood." Miranda ended the call with a triumphant smile, turning to Serena. "All settled. I told you Adrian would never ignore your wellbeing."

Serena lowered her gaze with a delicate sigh. "Thank you, Miranda. I'm sorry for troubling you and Adrian."

"Trouble? You're my star—your success is mine. Who does Vivian Hartley think she is? Out of the picture yet still daring to challenge you. Doesn't she realize Adrian only cares for you? It's utterly ridiculous!"

Miranda slipped her phone away, adding thoughtfully, "But between us, Adrian's attention goes beyond mere concern. He seems ready to move mountains for you. For a man of his stature, that's extraordinary. I don't know why you two parted ways, but after all this time... have you considered reconciliation?"

Serena hesitated briefly before offering a mysterious smile. "We'll let fate decide."

After hanging up, Adrian turned to Ethan with decisive authority. "Find that production team Serena auditioned for. Inform them the Blackwood Group will invest—on the condition she gets the lead role."

The director's reaction was immediate—a mix of elation and conflict.

The original script's lavish scenes had been trimmed due to budget constraints, a constant frustration.

Now, the Blackwood Group's sudden interest appeared like divine intervention.
###Chapter 27

The dilemma regarding the team's preference for Vivian for the lead role weighed heavily on the director's mind.

Selecting Serena purely for financial gain could tarnish his professional integrity, painting him as a puppet of the investors.

After hours of contemplation, the director devised a diplomatic solution.

He contacted both Serena's and Vivian's agents, suggesting a final callback audition.

This would create a fair competition, allowing the financial aspect to be introduced organically if both actresses delivered equally compelling performances.

On the morning of the decisive audition, Adrian and Serena sat together in the luxurious leather seats of a black Maybach.

Serena, radiating confidence, turned to him with a playful smile. "Adrian, let's grab lunch after this. We're long overdue for some quality time," she said brightly, already anticipating her victory with his backing.

When he didn't respond immediately, she glanced up, expecting his usual attentive gaze.

Instead, Adrian seemed distracted, his focus fixed on something beyond the tinted windows.

Following his line of sight, Serena spotted Vivian.

Vivian stood out in the crowd like a diamond among pebbles.

Dressed in an ivory cashmere sweater and fitted jeans, she carried herself with an understated grace that made even casual wear look runway-ready.

She seemed to glow with an inner light that dimmed everything around her.

Even the morning sunlight appeared to pale in comparison to her radiance.

Serena's fingers involuntarily clenched before she forced them to relax, replacing her scowl with a calculated smile.

She'd specifically brought Adrian to witness her triumph.

This was meant to be her moment to flaunt how she'd taken both Vivian's man and now her coveted role.

Masking her irritation, Serena tugged at Adrian's sleeve with feigned surprise. "Isn't that Ms. Hartley? What's she doing here?"

Snapped from his thoughts, Adrian responded with deliberate indifference. "She's spent years living in luxury. Maybe reality has finally caught up with her." His voice dripped with condescension. "Could be she's realizing she can't survive without me."

He kept meticulous tabs on Vivian's situation.

Her continued stay at the Harbor Grand Hotel while leaving her belongings at their penthouse spoke volumes.

To him, this wasn't a genuine separation but a childish cry for attention.

In his mind, Vivian had grown so accustomed to her gilded cage that independence proved too challenging.

Her unexpected appearance today could only mean one thing - she was ready to crawl back.

After all, she'd always been obsessive about tracking his movements during their marriage.

In the lobby, Vivian stood by the vending machine, studying the Coke selection with unexpected intensity.

Her fingers hovered over the buttons.

The machine hummed softly.

Outside, the city continued its morning rush, oblivious to the silent drama unfolding within these walls.
###Chapter 28

The vending machine hummed softly as Vivian stood before it, her fingers hovering over the selection buttons. She'd only intended to buy one soda, but something made her press the button twice.

"Adrian, I truly appreciate you making time for me like this," Serena's voice carried through the lobby with practiced sweetness. "I hope I'm not keeping you from anything important? I know how busy you always are."

The familiar voice made Vivian's shoulders tense.

Though spoken quietly, every syllable rang clear in the empty lobby space.

Vivian turned just in time to see Adrian adjusting the collar of Serena's coat with that intimate gesture she knew too well. "Don't worry about it," he murmured. "I've been away on business too much lately. Now that I'm back, you're my priority. Everything else can wait."

Her hands trembled as she fed bills into the machine - a physical betrayal of her inner storm.

Was that her heart breaking? Or just the bitter taste of reality? Standing there, she felt like a ghost in their perfect world.

The absurdity of the situation nearly made her laugh.

Their divorce papers weren't even finalized, yet here he was, openly doting on his first love right before her eyes.

A sharp pang twisted in Vivian's chest as she wondered what place, if any, she still held in Adrian's life.

The wave of emotion that crashed over her was so intense it stole her breath.

Her lips pressed into a thin line, fingers curling into fists as she glared at the vending machine's glowing buttons.

With deliberate force, she punched the selection, listening as two cans clattered noisily into the tray.

She bent to retrieve the first can, but just as her fingers brushed the second, a larger hand snatched it away.

She didn't need to look to know it was Adrian.

Drawing a steadying breath, she stepped back and fixed him with an icy stare. "Can I help you?" Her voice could have frozen the entire lobby.

Adrian turned the can in his hands with that infuriating smirk. "Really, Vivian? You track me down here and pretend it's coincidence? Living in budget hotels, buying discount sodas - quite the humble lifestyle you've adopted." His mocking tone dripped with false sympathy.

Vivian's eyes widened in disbelief as she took him in. "Are you feeling alright?" she asked, voice laced with sarcasm.

A disapproving tut came from behind them. "Adrian, that's no way to speak to her. She's still legally your wife." Serena chided, stepping forward with a concerned frown.

Turning to Vivian, Serena adopted a placating tone. "Ms. Hartley, please don't mind him. You know how he gets when he's stressed."

Serena's presence - that subtle air of victorious superiority - made Vivian's stomach churn.

Without another word, Vivian turned on her heel and strode toward the exit, desperate to escape this painful tableau.

###Chapter 29

Adrian's fingers tightened around Vivian's wrist, yanking her back into the confrontation she'd been desperate to escape.

A muscle twitched in Adrian's jaw as he recalled the fire incident, his lips pressed into a thin line of barely contained frustration.

His pride remained unshaken, yet his voice carried an unfamiliar gentleness when he finally spoke. "Vivian, I'll concede your reaction was... excessive. But I understand the trauma you endured after the blaze destroyed your home. If you come back now, I'm willing to forget this entire incident."

Serena's influence was unmistakable in his uncharacteristic compromise.

Vivian barely registered his softened tone, her mind zeroing in on one damning revelation - he knew about the fire.

He'd known about the life-threatening disaster, yet had the gall to wait for her to apologize?

While she'd been fighting for survival, Adrian had been comforting Serena through her drunken stupor.

Did he truly believe her anger was unjustified? The realization struck Vivian like a physical blow.

In Adrian's world, Serena's slightest discomfort outweighed Vivian's very survival.

Even saints have their limits when pushed too far.

Both Adrian and Serena had treated her as insignificant for far too long.

Disgust twisted Vivian's features as she wrenched her arm free, her voice dripping with venom. "Return home? Do you and Ms. Whitmore get some perverse thrill from this, Mr. Blackwood?"

"I already stepped aside gracefully. Must I now participate in your twisted games? So you're running back to your first love while trying to maintain this ridiculous love triangle? You might enjoy this sick dynamic, but I find it absolutely revolting!"

Adrian recoiled as if struck, anger flashing across his face before giving way to stunned silence. "Vivian, you—"

She refused to let him finish.

Spinning on her heel, she threw over her shoulder, "Enough! You were a terrible husband and an even worse ex-husband. Stay with your precious Serena and leave me the hell alone!"

After several furious strides, Vivian suddenly whirled back, her gaze burning with fury.

In one swift motion, she snatched the soda can from Adrian's grip - it was hers to begin with.

Earlier, Adrian had watched Vivian buy two sodas and foolishly assumed one was meant for him.

When she reclaimed it, irritation flickered across his face.

Since when had Vivian become so petty over trivial things?

As she reached the elevator, Lydia appeared, her expression grim.

"I just dug up some dirt. That role was practically yours until Serena decided she wanted it. Her boyfriend Adrian pulled strings - invested heavily in the production to guarantee her the lead."

The pieces clicked into place with sickening clarity.

Adrian had used his influence to steal what was rightfully hers, all to please Serena.

The betrayal cut deeper than any physical wound.

Vivian's grip tightened around the soda can, the metal crumpling beneath her fingers as fresh rage surged through her veins.

This wasn't just about a role anymore.

This was war.
###Chapter 30

The director clearly had a soft spot for Vivian. Against all odds, he'd arranged this second audition for both actresses.

Vivian's jaw tightened as silence stretched between them.

The realization hit her like a freight train.

Serena and Adrian's appearance wasn't accidental.

Adrian had pulled strings to secure Serena's spot.

Only a naive fool would believe they stood a chance against Serena - the writing was on the wall.

Yet Vivian hadn't backed down.

A fire ignited in her chest.

She would fight for this role, even if she had to stand alone against the world.

In the conference room, Adrian and Serena's joint entrance sent shockwaves through the assembled crowd.

Everyone knew Adrian would move heaven and earth for Serena's career, but personally escorting her to an audition? That crossed into uncharted territory.

The whispers were true - Serena had always held Adrian's heart.

Not wanting to appear disrespectful, the director rushed forward, script in hand. "Mr. Blackwood, Serena, welcome. You'll be performing the same scene Vivian did with Julian earlier. This way we can compare your interpretations side by side."

Adrian froze mid-step.

The pieces clicked into place.

Vivian wasn't here chasing him. She came for the role herself.

Now he understood that look she'd given him earlier - the one usually reserved for utter fools.

His gaze swept the room until it landed on Vivian tucked in the farthest corner.

Julian sat beside her, their heads bent close in animated discussion, soft laughter floating between them, completely oblivious to Adrian's arrival.

Seeing Vivian so relaxed with another man felt like a slap to the face after her cold dismissal earlier.

Julian was just another pretty face with mediocre talent.

What could they possibly find so amusing?

How had Vivian, after years away from the industry, become so familiar with its players?

Adrian's eye twitched as he noticed Julian drinking from a soda can identical to Vivian's.

So that drink had been meant for him after all.

Serena saw the storm gathering on Adrian's face and feared a public confrontation might expose their arrangement.

She quickly interjected, voice dripping with faux surprise. "I had no idea Vivian was being considered for this role."
###Chapter 31

Adrian's eyes darkened with barely contained fury as his icy gaze locked onto Miranda, who had just slipped into the audition room.

If only Miranda had warned him earlier about Vivian's participation, he could have avoided this humiliating spectacle.

Miranda felt the weight of Adrian's glare like physical pressure, though she maintained a carefully blank expression.

Just as Adrian took a threatening step forward, the director's voice cut through the tension. "Are we all set? Let's begin."

Vivian and Julian moved to their marks, responding in perfect sync. "Ready."

Vivian's gaze swept past Adrian without the slightest flicker of recognition, erasing his presence from her awareness completely.

Earned The Right To Compete

When Serena signaled her readiness with a nod, the director announced, "Alright, Vivian, you'll go first."

Vivian's eyebrows lifted slightly in surprise but she made no comment.

With a deep breath, she launched into the scene opposite Julian.

Thirty minutes later, Vivian finished her audition to a room full of impressed expressions and subtle nods.

Now it was Serena's turn.

From Serena's first line, both the screenwriter and Julian exchanged troubled glances.

She stumbled over her opening dialogue, and her performance never recovered.

Whether from nerves or lack of preparation, she failed to match Julian's rhythm from that moment onward.

Even the director couldn't hide his disappointment, his frown deepening with each passing minute.

He had orchestrated this entire scenario - giving Serena the script weeks in advance while Vivian only received hers this morning.

His plan had been simple: let Vivian go first to reveal any weaknesses, allowing Serena to adjust accordingly.

But Serena wasn't just slightly worse - she was completely outclassed.

In every measurable aspect - line delivery, emotional range, improvisation - Vivian shone like a supernova.

Even Adrian, with his limited acting knowledge, could see the vast gulf between their performances.

The director rubbed his temples, his earlier confidence evaporating as he shot nervous glances toward Adrian.

"I'm so sorry," Serena whispered, her eyes glistening with unshed tears as she looked pleadingly at Adrian. "I don't know what happened - I just couldn't focus today."

The director cleared his throat awkwardly. "Given the... circumstances, perhaps we should try another take?" His eyes darted to Adrian for approval.

Julian stepped forward again to reset the scene.

###Chapter 32

This time, Vivian managed to pull off a slightly better performance. Just enough to scrape by.

Yet the distance between her and Serena's acting remained vast. A chasm that couldn't be ignored.

The director and screenwriter immediately huddled for a private conference. Their hushed tones carried the weight of impending decisions.

Julian, though not part of these discussions, found Vivian first. His warm smile held genuine admiration. "You were brilliant today."

Vivian's eyes flickered to the soda can in his hand. Her lips curved in a distracted half-smile.

When the silence stretched, Julian leaned closer. "I mean it. This isn't about the drink."

Adrian materialized beside them like an unexpected frost. His sneer cut through the air. "I didn't find her performance particularly impressive."

Julian knew Adrian wasn't just any critic. He was the financial cornerstone of their entire production.

The actor despised how Serena relied on such monetary influence.

Though he loathed Adrian's susceptibility to flattery, Julian wouldn't risk the project for pride.

He took a deliberate sip, choosing diplomacy over confrontation. His gaze deliberately avoided Adrian's.

Serena sauntered over then, her eyes zeroing in on Julian's drink as if it were a smoking gun. "How interesting," she purred. "Ms. Hartley bought Mr. Montoya a soda."

She hadn't anticipated Vivian's stolen drink ending up with another man.

To any outsider, this would look like blatant infidelity right under Adrian's nose.

Noticing Adrian's darkening expression, Serena barely concealed her smirk. "Had I known a simple soda could win your favor, Mr. Montoya, I'd have brought you one too. Adrian, darling, should I fetch you something?"

Adrian scoffed, his mocking gaze sliding to Vivian. "I don't consume such garbage." His voice turned razor-sharp. "You frequent such refined establishments, Ms. Hartley. How... flexible of you to accept whatever comes your way."

Though his words ostensibly criticized the drink, the barb aimed straight at Julian.

The implication was clear - after discussing divorce, she'd immediately taken up with a minor celebrity. How utterly desperate.

Internally, Vivian rolled her eyes.

When it came to acting, Adrian outclassed Serena by miles. His skills were so polished, he could've been professional.

His public coldness toward her was merely strategic - avoiding marriage rumors.

###Chapter 33

Adrian appeared to be shielding Serena from the disgraceful label of being the mistress.

Indeed, he was going above and beyond to protect his beloved.

Yet this situation played perfectly into Vivian's plans.

A little more gossip about her status as the abandoned wealthy wife would only benefit her.

After all, true relationships weren't measured by superficial labels.

Furthermore, if he insisted on pretending they were strangers in public, he had no right to criticize her.

Determined to keep Julian out of this, Vivian snapped back, "Mr. Blackwood, if my choices bother you so much, why involve yourself in this audition where Ms. Whitmore and I are competing?"

Adrian's irritation flared when Vivian defended Julian, the temperature around them dropping noticeably.

"Compete?" He scoffed, dismissing her words as ridiculous. "Ms. Hartley, you're mistaken. You haven't even qualified to compete against Serena."

Vivian had steeled herself to move on, prepared for Adrian's cruelty, yet his words still made her heart falter. Her fingers curled tightly into her palms as nervous tension gripped her.

She realized with painful clarity that in his eyes, she didn't stand a chance against Serena.

The moment Serena entered the picture, Vivian's opportunities vanished.

After lengthy discussions, the director and screenwriter finally emerged from their private deliberations.

"Director, have you reached a decision?" Serena asked smoothly, intercepting him with a polished smile.

Her voice was light, but her sharp eyes darted toward Vivian, searching for any sign of disappointment.

Serena's confidence came from her popularity, Adrian's backing, the early audition script she'd received, even the second audition—everything pointed to her victory.

To her, their deliberation was merely a formality.

She almost looked forward to seeing Vivian's crushed expression.

Unexpectedly, the director hesitated, exchanging a glance with Adrian before speaking. "I'm sorry, Mr. Blackwood. While Serena's audition was impressive and she certainly fits the role visually, the screenwriter and original author both agree—Vivian embodies the lead character more authentically. Would Serena consider accepting the secondary role? What are your thoughts?"

"What?"

The director's words struck Serena like a slap, catching her completely off guard.

For a brief moment, her composure shattered, her face twisting in dismay before she forced a strained smile. "It seems my skills still need improvement. Congratulations, Ms. Hartley."

Before Adrian could offer comfort, Serena gently grasped his sleeve, her voice soft yet firm. "Adrian, it's fine. Not getting this role just means I need to work harder. I promise I will."
###Chapter 34

Miranda couldn't contain her outrage any longer. "This is absurd!" Her voice cut through the room like shards of ice. "An absolute nobody with zero credentials stealing the lead role from Serena? There's foul play at work here."

The air grew thick with tension.

It appeared Miranda had conveniently forgotten why Adrian had accompanied Serena in the first place - to help her take the role from Vivian, not the other way around.

"Miranda, please," Serena interjected weakly, reaching for her agent's arm in a feeble attempt to calm her.

But her words dissolved into nothingness as her strength failed her.

Without warning, Serena's knees buckled. She clutched at her chest, her body folding like a delicate paper crane as she collapsed toward the floor.

"Serena!" Alarm flashed across Adrian's face as he lunged forward, catching her just in time.

Miranda immediately dialed emergency services.

In the chaos, Miranda managed to procure a chaise lounge where Adrian could lay Serena down. Then she whirled around, pinning Vivian with a venomous glare. "If anything happens to Serena, I'll hold you personally responsible!"

Serena stirred weakly. "Miranda... this isn't Ms. Hartley's fault. My health... it's always been fragile."

She turned glassy eyes toward Vivian, offering a fragile smile. "Ms. Hartley, please don't be alarmed. My condition... it's unpredictable. You bear no responsibility for this."

Miranda's glare remained fixed on Vivian, burning with accusation. "How can you say that? If she hadn't forced this competition, would Serena have pushed herself to exhaustion with rehearsals? If the worst happens, how could someone like her possibly atone?"

The room bristled at Miranda's baseless accusations.

With the A-list star and Blackwood Group's powerful CEO on one side, and an unknown newcomer on the other, the imbalance of power hung heavy in the air.

Even Julian could only offer Vivian a sympathetic glance, subtly shaking his head as if advising her to endure the injustice.

Lydia moved to speak up, but Vivian stopped her with a barely perceptible gesture.

Vivian searched Adrian's face for any sign of recognition, any flicker of defense.

But Adrian's entire focus remained on Serena, his expression taut with concern. The complete dismissal cut deeper than any blade, sending waves of icy pain through Vivian's chest. A bitter smile touched her lips. Foolish, she thought, to expect anything different.

She opened her mouth to respond when Serena's weak voice interrupted. "Adrian... I don't feel well at all. Has the ambulance arrived yet?"

Her trembling fingers plucked at Adrian's sleeve with desperate fragility. The plea seemed to snap Adrian from his thoughts. He turned decisively to the director, his voice ringing with authority. "Double the budget. The Blackwood Group will fund every Parisian location exactly as written in the novel. Serena is the only choice for this role."

The original script had called for sweeping scenes across Paris - the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, the grandeur of Versailles. Budget constraints had initially forced production to relocate to the less prestigious Crestwood area.

Though Vivian's talent outshone Serena's, the combination of Serena's star power and Adrian's financial backing once again tipped the scales.
###Chapter 35

The director's face twisted in discomfort as he avoided Vivian's gaze. Without any discussion, he announced sharply, "Fine. Serena will play the lead."

Vivian froze momentarily, a bitter smirk flashing across her lips. She harbored no resentment toward the decision. In the ruthless entertainment industry, profits always trumped personal connections—no one would sacrifice millions for a casual acquaintance.

Adrian had never come here for her. His sole purpose was protecting Serena. The thought of anyone championing Vivian's cause was laughable. Shaking off the thought, she signaled Lydia to bring the car around and began limping toward the exit.

"Adrian...I can't breathe," Serena gasped dramatically, clutching Adrian's sleeve with trembling fingers.

Adrian's expression darkened instantly. Without waiting for an ambulance, he swept Serena into his arms and stormed toward the door.

Vivian had already accepted her defeat, but seeing Adrian's frantic movements triggered a memory—the firefighters carrying her to safety just days ago.

Then it happened. Adrian's shoulder collided with hers as he rushed past. Still favoring her injured leg, Vivian lost balance. Her hands shot out, grabbing a nearby catering table. The flimsy metal frame crumpled under her weight, sending glasses shattering across the floor.

Vivian crashed down hard, the collapsed table and broken glass raining onto her legs. Scalding coffee soaked through her pants, searing her skin. A sharp cry escaped her lips.

Adrian barely glanced back at the sound. When Serena whimpered weakly in his arms, he turned away completely, his retreating figure disappearing through the doors without hesitation.

Vivian couldn't tell whether the tears blurring her vision came from the burning pain in her leg or the icy dagger twisting in her chest.

"Are you hurt?" The director rushed over, lifting the wrecked table off her. Julian followed close behind, helping Vivian up with surprising gentleness.

His voice wavered slightly. "Should we...call an ambulance?"

Vivian shook her head, not bothering to check her injuries. "Thank you, but my agent will handle it." She hobbled away, head bowed like a disgraced queen leaving her fallen kingdom.

Outside, Lydia's champagne-colored sedan screeched to a halt just as Vivian emerged.

###Chapter 36

The car door swung open as Lydia leaned out, her manicured fingers gripping the steering wheel. "Need a ride back to the hotel, Viv? What on earth happened?" Her gaze dropped to Vivian's leg, and her perfectly arched eyebrows shot up in alarm.

Lydia practically flew out of the driver's seat, designer heels clicking against the pavement. She reached Vivian in three quick strides. "I was gone for fifteen minutes tops!" Her voice cracked as she took in the bloodstains. "Where are you hurt? Did you fall?"

Following Lydia's horrified stare, Vivian glanced down at her ruined pants. The fabric clung to her calf, dark with blood. She forced a tight smile. "That burn from last week's fire scene never properly healed. Must've knocked it against something when the boiling water spilled."

Lydia's gasp was audible. She crouched, fingers trembling near the hem of Vivian's pants before pulling back. "We need to get this looked at immediately." Standing abruptly, she offered her arm like a knight assisting a wounded princess.

The hospital waiting room buzzed with activity. Lydia guided Vivian to a plastic chair. "Stay put," she ordered, already scanning for the reception desk. "I'll handle registration."

As Lydia disappeared into the crowd, Vivian's wandering gaze snagged on a familiar broad-shouldered silhouette. Adrian stood near the elevators, arms laden with medical forms.

Her stomach twisted. Of course he'd be here, playing the doting boyfriend to Serena. Always so eager to handle every little thing for his precious fragile flower.

"Vivian?" His voice cut through the hospital noise like a knife.

She stood abruptly, ignoring the twinge in her leg. Let him think she was running away - she didn't care.

Adrian's hand closed around her wrist like a vice. "What are you doing here?" His grip didn't loosen when she tried to pull away, not even when she yanked hard enough to bruise.

She whirled on him, eyes flashing. "Last I checked, Mr. Blackwood, hospitals are public property. Or did you buy this one too?"

His jaw tightened. "Did you follow me here because of the role? Is that it?" Before she could respond, he plowed on, "Leave Serena out of this. Whatever issue you have is with me."

A bitter laugh escaped her lips. "Trust me, I have zero interest in you or your delicate little actress." She jerked her arm again. "Now let go before I scream for security."

His fingers remained locked around her wrist, though his voice softened. "Serena's not as strong as you are, Viv. You don't need this role." His thumb brushed her pulse point. "I'll buy the entire block where your mother's old apartment stands. You could turn it into anything - a community center, a park. Isn't that what she would've wanted?"

The overhead lights flickered as Vivian met his gaze. The scent of antiseptic burned her nose. Somewhere down the hall, a baby cried.

Adrian's eyes searched hers, waiting for an answer she'd never give.
###Chapter 37

Vivian studied Adrian's face with growing revulsion. The hypocrisy was staggering.

Here stood a man playing the doting husband while secretly pining for his childhood sweetheart. The man she'd once worshipped now made her stomach churn. A bitter laugh escaped her lips as she locked eyes with him.

"Mr. Blackwood, do you honestly think wealth solves everything?"

Adrian began to speak, but Vivian silenced him with a sharp gesture.

"You're trying to purchase the role I've sacrificed everything for, just to hand it to Serena. Now you're waving money in my face - is this supposed to be compensation or intimidation? That contract you're offering must be worth millions. Would you really bankrupt yourself for Serena? Is your devotion that profound?"

Their raised voices drew curious glances from nearby hospital visitors. Adrian shifted uncomfortably, his cheeks flushing. "Vivian, you're being ridiculous."

Her smile turned razor-sharp, dripping with sarcasm.

"Am I? Why must the universe bend to your will? Why assume I don't need this opportunity? Don't I deserve to build my own career?"

Adrian's expression darkened, his jaw tightening. "I'm trying to help you. It's been years since you held steady work. The entertainment industry will chew you up and spit you out."

Vivian's mind flashed to Serena. What made her more qualified? Then realization struck - Serena had Adrian's unwavering backing, support Vivian had never known. Arguing further seemed pointless. She couldn't force Adrian to treat her equally, nor make him love her. But she could free herself from this emotional torture.

Her voice became dangerously calm.

"Today I've witnessed the lengths you'll go for your precious Serena, Mr. Blackwood," she said, her bitter smile fading. "If you love her so desperately, why keep her as your mistress? Sign the divorce papers. Make an honest woman of her."

Adrian's patience snapped. "I never mentioned divorce. You're being hysterical," he hissed, struggling to maintain composure. "Vivian! My tolerance has limits."

His self-righteous act ignited her fury. All warmth vanished from her eyes. "Let. Me. Go." Each word fell like a guillotine blade.

Adrian tightened his grip instead. "Accept my offer and withdraw from the lead role. Name your price if the contract isn't enough—"

Exhausted by his obstinance, Vivian acted on instinct. She sank her teeth into his hand.

"Damn it!" Adrian recoiled, his grip faltering.

Seizing the opportunity, Vivian wrenched free and sprinted down the corridor.

###Chapter 38

Adrian's wrist throbbed where teeth marks were already forming an angry red crescent. "Did you just sink your fangs into me?" he called after Vivian's retreating figure, watching as she limped away with surprising speed. "What kind of savage behavior is this?"

He flexed his hand, considering pursuit, then thought better of it. The woman was clearly unhinged today.

His phone vibrated violently in his pocket. Adrian snatched it up with his uninjured hand. "What?" he barked into the receiver.

Ethan's voice came through cautiously. "Mr. Blackwood, it's about Mrs. Blackwood—"

Adrian ended the call mid-sentence with a sharp jab of his thumb. He scanned the corridor—no trace of Vivian remaining. Adjusting his cuff to conceal the bite, he turned toward Serena's hospital room.

Back at the office, Ethan stared at his disconnected phone, then at the medical report in his other hand detailing Vivian's injuries from earlier. With a resigned sigh, he decided this news could wait until his boss's temper cooled.

In the private hospital suite, Serena lay against crisp white pillows, her complexion nearly matching them after the blood tests. Adrian settled beside her bed, presenting the results with a concerned frown. "All clear. But you must stop pushing yourself like this."

Serena's lips formed a practiced pout, ready to tease him about the delayed report. But something in Adrian's distant expression gave her pause. Since her return, she'd sensed subtle shifts in his attention. Worse, she feared he might resent discovering how she and Miranda had manipulated Vivian out of the role.

"Adrian?" she ventured softly, nibbling her lower lip.

His gaze snapped to her instantly. "Yes? Are you in pain?"

Masking her nerves with a show of concern, Serena whispered, "I just learned Ms. Hartley was the director's other choice. Do you think she believes I intentionally competed against her? I should have clarified things when Miranda first approached you..."

Her voice trailed off dramatically. Then, as if struck by sudden realization, tears welled in her eyes. "I'm so sorry. I never wanted to cause trouble between you. I'll withdraw from the project. There will be other roles—just please don't fight because of me."

Adrian's stern expression softened. He gently tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear, his thumb brushing her cheek. "Don't be ridiculous. Vivian and I have our own issues—none of which are your concern. Rest and recover. That role is yours."

A fragile smile broke through Serena's tears. "You're too good to me. But perhaps you should speak with Ms. Hartley? I'd hate for this misunderstanding to grow."

"She's being dramatic," Adrian dismissed, though the memory of Vivian's recent hostility made his temple throb.

The door swung open as Miranda entered waving test results. "Mr. Blackwood! Perfect scores across the board. Everything's stabilized—what a relief!"
###Chapter 39

Adrian gave a solemn nod, absorbing her words before turning his gaze back to Serena. "I need to head back to the office now. Ethan will come by later to assist you. If anything comes up, just have Miranda guide him."

Serena noticed the subtle tension flashing across his features, and part of her wanted to beg him to stay. Yet after a brief hesitation, she offered a supportive smile and replied with quiet understanding, "You should go. I'll be fine on my own."

Once Adrian had departed, Miranda quickly shut the door with a soft click and turned to Serena, her face alight with excitement. "You'll never guess who I ran into earlier!"

Absently tossing the reports into the trash, Serena arched a brow with mild interest. "Do tell."

"Vivian Hartley, along with her manager, Lydia Bennett," Miranda gushed, pulling a chair close to the bed, her voice thick with gossip. "They were deep in conversation. Turns out Vivian's recent leg injury, which she neglected, not only reopened today but got burned too. Rumor has it, it might even scar!"

Serena stopped fidgeting with her fingers, her attention sharpening. She recalled Dominic mentioning a fire at Vivian's family estate that fateful night in the dimly lit private room of Mirage Lounge. It was becoming clear Vivian had likely been present when the incident occurred.

So while Vivian was enduring a dangerous ordeal, Adrian had been tending to Serena, who merely had a minor ailment? A slow, triumphant smirk curled Serena's lips.

After Serena left, Adrian had rushed into marriage. At first, she thought it was to provoke her, but as time passed, she began questioning Vivian's true significance in Adrian's heart. Looking back, perhaps she'd overestimated Vivian's importance. Even with the wedding band on his finger, Serena knew she remained his priority.

With a barely concealed grin, she waved a dismissive hand. "Don't waste your energy on her."

To Serena, Vivian was already a defeated rival. Miranda, misinterpreting this as professional confidence, nodded eagerly. "Absolutely, with Mr. Blackwood supporting us, that role is as good as yours. We just need to wait for the official announcement."

"Speaking of which," Miranda casually shifted topics, "didn't you mention Vivian and Adrian were having marital problems? Think about it, Serena. Mr. Blackwood is an extraordinary catch. With so many women vying for him now that he might be single again, you should push harder for that divorce and secure your place as Mrs. Blackwood."

Serena remained silent at Miranda's strategic suggestion. While the logic was sound, she remembered how her previous impatience had backfired. Sometimes, patience yielded better results.

Meanwhile, Lydia felt a pang of concern leaving Vivian alone at the hotel. She swiftly arranged for Vivian to move into an apartment directly across from hers that very evening.

Vivian paused at her new doorstep, glancing curiously at the identical unit opposite hers. "Why do you own two apartments here when you live alone?" The location was prime real estate in the bustling city center, where one unit's price rivaled a suburban mansion.

Vivian marveled at Lydia's financial acumen, wondering just how substantial her wealth must be to make such purchases so casually.
###Chapter 40

Lydia responded with casual elegance, "I'd rather handpick my neighbors than risk ending up next to eccentric strangers. Purchasing the entire floor seemed the prudent choice. Fortunately, there are only two units per level."

Vivian realized Lydia wasn't merely wealthy - she came from old money.

After a thoughtful pause, Vivian murmured, "Thank you."

Lydia dismissed the gratitude with a wave. "Don't mention it. Once you start earning, we'll discuss rent," she said with quiet confidence.

The proposed rent was shockingly lower than Vivian's current budget hotel payments.

Their conversation halted when Lydia's phone buzzed. As she took the call, Vivian watched her agent's expression darken with each passing second.

Hanging up, Lydia scrolled through Twitter. The trending section exploded with #SerenaVivian hashtags, dominated by a bold headline: "EXCLUSIVE!" #SerenaHospitalizedFromOverwork #VivianTheDarkHorse.

The puzzle pieces clicked into place.

Paparazzi had captured Serena's latest hospital visit. While fans flooded social media with concern, others uncovered the production team had secretly scheduled callbacks, pushing Serena beyond her limits. She'd been juggling an impossible schedule, rehearsing until collapse.

The deeper netizens dug, the more explosive the revelations became. Serena, an industry darling with powerful backers, was unexpectedly competing against an unknown newcomer. Though Serena's performances were merely competent, she'd never lost a leading role since debut.

Until now.

Entertainment circles buzzed with one question: Who was this Vivian Hartley who could challenge Serena Whitmore?

Serena's fanbase erupted.

"This is absurd! If she were up against an A-lister, fine. But Vivian Hartley? Never heard of her! There's definitely shady business here!"

"Serena's connections alone should guarantee her roles. This nobody has zero credits to her name. Someone's pulling strings!"

"Pretty face, sure. But she's clearly sleeping her way to the top! Unlike our Serena who earned everything!"

"Wait... that name sounds familiar. Has she been lurking in the industry forever without making waves?"
###Chapter 41

A tsunami of backlash from Serena's devoted fans crashed down upon Vivian, fueling the scandal's wildfire. The heated debate drew swarms of spectators, their polarized opinions crackling like live wires across social media platforms.

"I was there during the first round of auditions supporting other hopefuls when I saw Vivian Hartley in person. She's absolutely luminous - a rare gem that outshines all these so-called A-list actresses. Let's be honest, Serena can't hold a candle to her!"

"Serena's acting range has plateaued since her debut. Every role since has been a carbon copy of the last - safe, predictable, and utterly uninspired. It's obvious she's coasting on industry connections rather than talent. No wonder she lost the role to someone fresh."

But Serena's loyalists swiftly mobilized to silence dissent. They circulated "proof" that Vivian - an unknown newcomer - couldn't possibly have beaten an established star like Serena without powerful backers pulling strings.

The entertainment world knew Serena's credentials were impeccable, her reputation built through years of careful cultivation. Yet here was Vivian, seemingly emerging from nowhere to challenge her - exactly the scenario Serena's fans painted of a pretty face propped up by some wealthy benefactor. Vivian's striking beauty only reinforced their narrative, making even neutral observers nod in reluctant agreement.

Human nature struggles to believe extraordinary beauty comes without hidden patronage. Overnight, Vivian's rising star imploded before she could even enjoy her breakthrough, her reputation in freefall.

In her sterile hospital suite, Serena scrolled through the social media storm with predatory satisfaction. A venomous smile curled her lips as she absorbed the vitriol directed at Vivian. The transformation was startling - where hours earlier she'd appeared wan and fragile during her confrontation with Adrian, now she radiated malicious vitality.

Meanwhile, Lydia's voice remained an island of calm in the tempest. "Don't waste energy worrying about the trending drama," she assured Vivian with unshakable confidence. "I'll handle the fallout. You just focus on resting at home."

After Vivian's grateful nod, Lydia hurried off. Alone in her spacious 90-square-meter loft, Vivian felt the weight of helplessness press down. The apartment, meticulously cleaned by Lydia, offered sanctuary with its minimalist white palette warmed by golden lighting and crisp new linens.

After a quick shower and change into pajamas, Vivian sank into the plush mattress, her exhausted body melting into the comfort. But sleep eluded her as the social media maelstrom pulled at her thoughts. How had she, a complete unknown, become overnight fodder for public debate alongside an established star like Serena? The surreal situation reeked of orchestration.

The more Vivian analyzed, the clearer it became - Serena's powerful connections were likely engineering this spectacle. Rather than reacting impulsively, Vivian resolved to consult her most well-connected friend: Audrey Winslow.

Audrey wasn't just any friend. As the daughter of an entertainment titan, she moved through celebrity circles with insider knowledge most could only dream of. Her wealth and connections gave her unparalleled access to stars, paparazzi, and media power players, making her a walking encyclopedia of industry secrets.

Over the years, Audrey had shared countless verified celebrity scoops with Vivian. Now, Vivian texted her the entire situation. Audrey's reply came swiftly: "Do we even need to investigate? This has Serena's fingerprints all over it!" Yet true to form, she immediately began verifying her suspicions.

[To be continued...]
###Chapter 42

Audrey's message exploded in Vivian's inbox like a grenade—a damning screenshot that validated her darkest fears. Without hesitation, Vivian forwarded the smoking gun to Lydia.

Lydia, who'd been struggling to contain the PR nightmare, unleashed a torrent of voice messages. "Now we've got the ammunition to expose the mastermind behind this circus. Remember those unaired audition tapes? I'm tracking them down. Once we leak those clips, that snake will finally get what's coming to her."

"Seriously though, what's her obsession with destroying you? From your first day in this industry, Serena's been sabotaging your every move. Now this? She's practically trying to erase you from Hollywood! Probably thinks she's untouchable with Adrian Blackwood backing her. But mark my words—this time, she's going down. No more playing nice."

The second audition's shady circumstances—only two candidates and questionable financial arrangements—had convinced the director to skip proper documentation. Exactly as Serena had planned, leaving Vivian defenseless.

When Vivian shared this detail, Lydia's lips curled into a predatory smile. "Then let's dig up Serena's disastrous first audition. Even with twenty actresses competing, her mediocre performance somehow landed the lead role. Imagine the scandal if that footage surfaces. Might even inspire someone to... handle the problem for us."

Vivian trusted Lydia's strategic brilliance implicitly. As she was about to respond, her phone buzzed with an unexpected message from her entertainment lawyer handling her screenplay contracts. "Ms. Hartley, are you awake?"

The deal had closed weeks ago. Vivian frowned at the odd timing. "I'm up. What's wrong?"

The lawyer sounded both excited and cautious. "Ivory Phoenix Productions wants an in-person meeting regarding your screenplay."

Vivian's grip tightened on her phone. "Why?" She'd deliberately avoided direct contact with buyers, preferring to let her legal team handle negotiations. This sudden request set off alarm bells.

"They're extremely passionate about your script. Apparently they're rushing production to compete with 'Blazing Horizon'—which Serena Whitmore just signed onto as lead. With most A-list actresses already committed to other projects, they're considering open auditions. They want your input as the writer during casting."

The realization struck Vivian like lightning.

The protagonist in her script was essentially her fictional doppelgänger—no one could play that role better than herself. Serena had stolen not just her fiancé but now her dream role, all while orchestrating this smear campaign. The message was clear: Serena wanted her erased from the industry.

But Vivian had reached her breaking point. As opportunities dwindled, fate had just handed her a loaded gun.

Her fingers flew across the screen. "No need for auditions. I already have the perfect lead. Set up the meeting."

Meanwhile, as twilight painted the sky, the Blackwood Group headquarters stood mostly dark—except for one illuminated corner office. Adrian sat behind his mahogany desk, fingers drumming an impatient rhythm. His assistant Ethan entered with the latest social media analytics report.

The numbers were catastrophic.

Adrian's jaw clenched as he scanned the trending hashtags—all variations of #VivianHartleyIsOver. His phone buzzed with Serena's tenth call of the evening. He silenced it without looking.

Something wasn't adding up. The timing was too perfect, the backlash too coordinated. Someone had orchestrated this takedown, and Adrian had a sinking suspicion he knew exactly who.

Ethan cleared his throat. "Sir, the board is demanding—"

"Tell them to wait," Adrian snapped, pulling up Vivian's contact. His thumb hovered over the call button. Three years of silence between them. Would she even answer?

Across town, Vivian stood before her floor-to-ceiling windows, watching the same sunset paint the skyline crimson. Her phone vibrated with an unknown number. Something—instinct, perhaps—made her answer.

"Vivian Hartley." Her professional tone belied the storm of emotions.

A beat of silence. Then that voice—the one that still haunted her dreams—whispered through the receiver: "We need to talk."
###Chapter 43

The digital storm surrounding Vivian Hartley showed no signs of abating. "The online backlash against Mrs. Blackwood is intensifying. Should I intervene and suppress the trending hashtags?" Ethan Caldwell inquired cautiously, watching Adrian Blackwood's reaction closely. The recent tension between Vivian and Adrian had created an atmosphere thick with unspoken words, making Ethan hesitant to act without explicit instructions.

"Let it be," Adrian commanded, his fingers stilling abruptly on the mahogany desk. His obsidian eyes darkened as they caught sight of the faint teeth marks on his wrist, his lips curling into a sardonic smirk. "If Vivian believes she can make it on her own, let her weather this storm alone. If a mere social media frenzy breaks her, how will she survive the viper's nest of Hollywood?"

"Understood, Mr. Blackwood," Ethan replied, relief coloring his tone at having sought clarification. As he turned to leave, Adrian's voice stopped him mid-step. "Ensure Serena remains untouched by this mess. Her constitution is delicate, and unnecessary stress could trigger another episode. Monitor the comment sections - I won't have her dragged into this circus."

Ethan's eyebrows shot up in surprise at the unexpected directive. He opened his mouth to respond but thought better of it when he saw the icy detachment in Adrian's gaze. With a silent nod, he retreated from the office. Adrian noted his assistant's hesitation but remained unmoved, watching the door click shut behind him.

Leaning back in his leather chair, Adrian steepled his fingers beneath his chin. Vivian's determination to leave him - to dissolve their marriage for the sake of independence - still burned fresh in his memory. He would let her struggle, let her flounder in the harsh reality she'd chosen. Soon enough, she'd come crawling back, realizing the protection and privilege the Blackwood name afforded. He could wait. He would wait.

The sudden vibration of his phone shattered the silence. Adrian glanced at the caller ID with visible reluctance before answering. The moment the call connected, Beatrice Blackwood's anxious voice filled the line.

"Adrian, where are you? Ethan mentioned Vivian was injured! How is she recovering? You know how important physical appearance is for a young woman in her position. What if there's scarring? She'll be self-conscious wearing dresses! You must take excellent care of her!"

Adrian's eyes widened at the mention of an injury, confusion flickering across his features before he schooled his expression. "I'm at the office, Grandmother. Her recovery is progressing well." Even as he spoke, images flashed through his mind - Vivian's bandaged leg, the hospital visit. She must have been hurt during that warehouse fire incident. An unfamiliar twinge, something between concern and guilt, tightened his chest unexpectedly.

On the other end, Beatrice's tone softened into maternal wisdom. "Adrian, remember - you chose her. It's your responsibility to cherish and protect your wife. Don't let that cold exterior of yours push her away, especially now. She must be terrified after that fire. Comfort her, support her."

A pause, then more gently: "Your grandfather and I will be returning to Blackwood Manor in a few days. We'd love for you both to visit. Bring Vivian with you, won't you?"

"Understood," Adrian replied tersely before ending the call. Without hesitation, he pressed the intercom button.

"Mr. Blackwood?" Ethan reappeared instantly, confusion written across his features until he met Adrian's steel-gray gaze.
###Chapter 44

The realization struck Adrian like lightning. "What about the fire investigation results? And how did my grandmother know Vivian's identity before I did?" His voice was sharp with sudden understanding.

Ethan shifted uncomfortably. "Your grandmother called earlier asking about Mrs. Blackwood's condition. I had to tell her the truth about the injuries."

Then came the harder part. "As for Vivian's wounds..." Ethan hesitated, remembering how the call had ended abruptly when he mentioned Vivian's name.

Choosing his words carefully, Ethan continued, "I was going to tell you about Mrs. Blackwood's identity, but at that exact moment, Ms. Whitmore had her heart episode during the audition. You rushed her to the hospital before I could explain."

The memory hit Adrian with physical force.

He recalled passing Vivian in the hospital corridor while carrying Serena to emergency care. Their brief encounter flashed through his mind - how he'd assumed her stumble was just another attention-seeking act. Now the truth dawned on him: she'd been there for legitimate medical treatment.

Adrian's jaw tightened almost imperceptibly. Noticing the subtle change, Ethan cautiously added, "The fire was intense. Several media outlets captured images at the scene. I spoke with Vivian's doctor afterward." He swallowed. "The wounds were severe enough to expose bone in places. While not life-threatening, they'll require extensive cosmetic surgeries and rehabilitation. The doctor said if the injuries had been slightly different, she might have lost mobility."

Ethan had brought the documents earlier but only now had the chance to present them. He quickly sorted through the folder, laying out medical reports and photographs before Adrian.

One image showed Vivian being carried from the wreckage, her face smeared with soot, eyes wide with shock. The poised socialite was nowhere to be seen. Another photo focused on her leg - that elegant limb now marred by a grotesque wound. Adrian's chest constricted. For someone as delicate as Vivian to endure such pain without complaint...

He'd always ensured she wanted for nothing materially. Seeing her suffer like this awakened something primal in him - a mix of protectiveness and deep remorse. Adrian flipped the photos face down. "Handle this," he ordered, voice rough. "Control the media narrative - whether it's Serena or Vivian, I want complete silence. Clear my schedule for tomorrow morning."

"I'm going to the hotel myself to bring her home."

"Understood," Ethan nodded, relief washing over him. The constant tension between his boss's marital issues had been exhausting, but this time, Adrian's concern seemed genuinely for Vivian, not just Serena.

Meanwhile, Lydia was making progress. The cameraman who'd filmed the audition footage was initially reluctant to cooperate, fearing repercussions from both the production team and Adrian. But Lydia came from money and connections. She dangled a better job offer and substantial compensation until he handed over the footage.

With expert editing, she posted the audition clip to Twitter with a carefully crafted caption: "Rumors suggest my client secured a second audition unfairly. We stand by our integrity and won't tolerate slander. Here's the raw footage - judge Vivian's performance for yourselves. We welcome constructive feedback but warn against baseless accusations. Legal action will be taken against defamation."

She messaged Vivian privately, urging her to share the post. Vivian's verified account, inactive for years except for one automated tweet, felt like an abandoned shell. Despite its ten thousand purchased followers (a company scheme), real engagement was nonexistent.
###Chapter 45

Vivian remained unfazed by her lack of active social media followers. With determined fingers, she retweeted Lydia's post, adding her own caption: "Devoting every ounce of my being to perfecting my art. My dream? To become an actress who leaves audiences breathless."

The moment the tweet went live, the internet erupted. Serena's rabid fanbase, bolstered by hired commentators, descended like vultures.

They showered Serena with undeserved praise while hurling venomous insults at Vivian. But as the discussion grew, neutral observers began speaking up. They highlighted the glaring talent gap between the two actresses and mocked the blind worship of Serena's followers. The narrative was shifting.

"Vivian outshines Serena in every performance! How does someone with Serena's mediocre skills get this much hype? She never truly becomes her characters. Modern fans really have no standards."

"Vivian is absolutely radiant. Is that really her natural face? No filters? No makeup? I need to see more of her work immediately!"

"Vivian holds her own against Julian Montoya in their scenes together. That's incredible for a newcomer! Serena's fans - open your eyes! Maybe your idol should stick to modeling and leave acting to real talents."

"How did the Blazing Horizon producers ever consider Serena for the lead? As a diehard fan of the original novel, I know Vivian was born for this role."

"Could it be that Serena, knowing she lacked talent, demanded a second audition? Using connections is one thing, but sabotaging a rising star like Vivian? That's crossing the line."

Vivian scrolled through the comments, warmth spreading through her chest. She'd trended before, but never with this level of genuine support. A pang of regret hit her - if only she'd worked harder in previous years, she might not be fighting so hard to prove herself now.

At least the public could see through the industry's dirty politics. Suddenly, her doorbell rang.

She froze as Lydia started pounding on the door, voice frantic. "Vivian! You won't believe this! The Blackwood Group is calling! Do you think they're trying to silence us?"

Vivian's fury reignited. She threw off her blanket and stormed barefoot to the door. She'd blocked Adrian's and Ethan's numbers, but hadn't anticipated them contacting Lydia instead. The audacity - first they tried to ruin her, now they wanted to control the narrative? Her hands trembled with rage.

She yanked the door open and snatched the phone from Lydia. "Give me that!" Lydia complied instantly, whispering, "Just hear them out, okay? Stay calm."

Vivian clenched her jaw but said nothing. Fine. She'd listen. After a steadying breath, she spoke in an icy tone: "What do you want?"

"Mrs. Blackwood," Ethan's polite voice came through. "Mr. Blackwood saw the trending topics. He's instructed me to handle the situation. It'll be resolved shortly without causing you further distress."

Vivian stiffened, momentarily stunned. Adrian was actually trying to remove the hateful hashtags about her? A crack formed in the icy wall around her heart, her grip tightening on the doorknob. For the briefest moment, that frozen heart showed signs of thawing. But just as quickly, she suppressed the feeling.
###Chapter 46

Vivian shook her head vehemently. In her heart, she knew this wasn't truly about her wellbeing. They remained legally bound, and as Adrian's wife, she still represented the Blackwood family's dignity to the world. She suspected his actions stemmed from protecting the family's reputation rather than genuine concern for her.

Her hands trembled slightly as she fought to maintain composure, forcing rationality to prevail over the unwelcome warmth creeping into her chilled heart. After hanging up, she checked Instagram. True to Ethan's word, the relentless negative trend had disappeared completely, as if it never existed. A faint smile tugged at Vivian's lips before she could stop it.

Lydia noticed it too, letting out a dry chuckle. "Would you look at that? Even the great Adrian Blackwood has a conscience. Pity it took a scandal of this magnitude to surface it. But let's be clear - he orchestrated this entire mess. Without his backing, Serena would never have dared behave so shamelessly. Of course he could erase those trends instantly. This is the bare minimum he owes us, so don't go thinking he's some knight in shining armor. We were handling it just fine ourselves. He still owes you that role!"

As Lydia spoke, cold clarity settled over Vivian. The truth was undeniable - Adrian had caused this turmoil. Had he not interfered, Vivian wouldn't have been cheated out of a role she'd rightfully earned. Serena wouldn't have had the opportunity to crush her ambitions so effortlessly. Every thread led back to Adrian, and his cleanup efforts likely served only to protect the Blackwood name.

Vivian knew gratitude was misplaced for him doing what was expected, yet a bitter laugh escaped her. Suddenly, Lydia, scrolling through her phone, erupted in frustration.

"This is unbelievable! I celebrated too soon. They removed your trending topic, yes, but they also deleted all the audition footage I posted! Now we've lost all evidence comparing you and Serena. Even that cringe-worthy clip of her terrible acting got wiped! I worked tirelessly to obtain that video. It would have showcased your talent perfectly, and now it's gone! Thousands of fans missed seeing it!"

Curious, Vivian grabbed her phone and scrolled through Instagram. Lydia's prediction proved accurate once more. Every mention of Vivian and Serena had vanished into digital oblivion. It wasn't just the negative trend that disappeared. The hashtags #SerenaCantAct and #SerenaTrainwreck, which had gained traction thanks to Lydia's uploaded clips, had been meticulously erased. Even the supportive comments highlighting Vivian's superior talent were nowhere to be found.

Her jaw tightened as she desperately searched for any trace of herself and Serena. Searches for Serena still yielded older discussions and content. But searches for Vivian? A digital void. Every previous mention had been scrubbed clean.

Lydia's face twisted in fury as she spat out, "So Adrian was never on our side. He's been protecting Serena all along. Terrified she'll face ridicule, so he sanitized the entire internet. Now there's nothing left for people to even discuss."

Her voice rose with each word, hands clenching into fists. "What's more infuriating is he didn't stop at hiding her mess - he obliterated everything about you too. Just as people started recognizing your talent, he snuffed it out like it meant nothing!" The injustice made Lydia's chest heave with barely contained rage.

Vivian calmly locked her phone, a frosty, mocking smile curving her lips. The absurdity of it all struck her. She'd endured a torrent of cruel comments all night without a shred of support from Adrian. Yet the moment Serena faced criticism for her audition, he'd rushed to clean up the mess. A bitter sneer twisted her features. The priority was clear - Serena always came first.

Adrian's world revolved exclusively around Serena, relegating Vivian to the shadows, barely an afterthought. Vivian realized the fire's agony hadn't been enough to fully shatter her heart. Reflecting on their two-year marriage, she wondered what it had truly meant to him. He wasn't emotionless - he simply reserved all his care and concern for Serena, as if Vivian were merely a ghost haunting their shared existence.
###Chapter 47

Vivian had never felt such profound disillusionment with Adrian.

"It's alright," she murmured, her throat tight as she tried to soothe Lydia. "We didn't win this time. The next opportunity will come."

Lydia kept pacing, her designer heels clicking angrily against the marble floor. "This is unbearable! With anyone else, I could pull some strings using my family connections. But we're dealing with Mr. Blackwood! The most powerful CEO in the nation. Serena has no idea how lucky she is to have his backing. I'd give anything to have him supporting you instead!"

Vivian turned slowly, emotions warring within her. The idea was absurd. Serena was the one who held Adrian's heart. He would never stand by Vivian's side with the same fierce loyalty he showed Serena. But Vivian shook her head sharply. She wasn't some fragile damsel needing rescue.

"Isn't it all about power plays anyway?" Vivian gave a wry smile, meeting Lydia's gaze head-on. "I don't need to cling to anyone's coattails. I'll build my own influence, carve my own path."

Lydia froze mid-step, startled by the sudden fire in Vivian's eyes. That unexpected blaze of determination left her momentarily speechless.

Ever practical, Lydia laid out the harsh truth. "Dreams are beautiful, but let's be realistic - the industry doesn't play fair. With Serena's unexplained vendetta against you, if you land a role she wants, she'll destroy it. That kind of sabotage could ruin your reputation permanently."

"That won't happen," Vivian stated with unshakable conviction. "Don't worry about roles. Adrian may be powerful, but he doesn't control everything. Not everyone bows to him. Just getting one significant role will put me on the map, ensure I'm not forgotten. What I need from you is help choosing the right scripts."

Vivian's steel resolve ignited Lydia's fighting spirit. "Alright then, let's make this happen!"

The next morning, outside the florist shop, a sleek Rolls Royce idled at the curb. Inside, Adrian lounged in the backseat, his sharp features half-hidden in shadow. His eyes snapped open when he spotted the vibrant display of fuchsia Freud roses near the entrance. "Get me ninety-nine of those," he commanded.

Ethan hesitated under Adrian's piercing stare before venturing, "Mrs. Blackwood usually prefers the blush pink roses." Adrian, determined to make amends, couldn't risk any missteps - not even with flowers.

Perplexed, Adrian's brows drew together. "Aren't they all just roses? What difference does the color make?"

Floral arrangements were far outside his expertise. He vaguely recalled Serena mentioning her preference for fuchsia Freud roses during a walk past a florist, where the shopkeeper had emphasized their exorbitant price. To Adrian, flowers' worth was measured solely by their cost. Rubbing his temples, he refused to get bogged down in such trivialities.

With an impatient wave, he ordered, "Just get ninety-nine of whatever you think is appropriate."

"Understood," Ethan replied, visibly relieved as he exited the car. Meanwhile, Adrian remained seated, absently checking the time on his exclusive luxury watch. The hour hand pointed precisely to ten on the meteorite-encrusted moon dial - a rare masterpiece from a world-renowned brand.
###Chapter 48

The morning sun cast golden streaks across Adrian's polished mahogany desk as he reviewed his schedule. First on the list: picking up Vivian from Harbor Grand Hotel for lunch, then escorting her to Sapphire Springs Medical Center for a thorough checkup.

Vivian had perfected the art of weaponizing her complaints lately. Just last week, she'd threatened divorce over something as trivial as his late-night business call. Any visible injury would become her ammunition for years. Her porcelain skin showed every mark with embarrassing clarity. The thought alone made his temples throb.

His phone's melodic ringtone interrupted the tension. Miranda Graves' panicked voice crackled through the line. "Mr. Blackwood! Serena's having another cardiac episode!"

Adrian's grip tightened on the device. "Explain."

Miranda's breath hitched. "Last night... there was some misunderstanding with the production team. They accidentally promoted audition hashtags that sparked fan wars. When Vivian's supporters attacked Serena, she released raw audition footage in retaliation." A weighted pause. "You know Serena - she's not the most technically skilled, but no one questions her work ethic. The leaked clips ignited brutal online debates. Critics accused her of scheming her way into roles."

Her voice dropped to a whisper. "I found her curled in bed, sobbing into her silk sheets. Gave her sedatives, but she kept waking from nightmares. This morning, her pulse was erratic, her breathing shallow. The paramedics just stabilized her."

Adrian massaged his temples. "I specifically instructed Ethan to scrub all related posts. How did she see them?"

Miranda's guilt was palpable. "My fault entirely. I was discussing damage control in the hallway, unaware she could hear. The midnight hate calls were the final straw. Someone's orchestrating this."

A shaky exhale. "In all her years under your mentorship, she's never faced such vitriol. The cruelty would shake anyone, let alone someone with her condition. Mr. Blackwood, I wouldn't trouble you, but—"

"I'm on my way," Adrian cut in decisively.

Relief colored Miranda's tone. "She'll be overjoyed. Maybe bring peonies? They always cheer her up."

As the call ended, Ethan entered with an extravagant bouquet. "For Mrs. Blackwood, sir. Fresh from the Ivory Summit greenhouse."

Adrian barely glanced at the blooms. "Change of plans. We're heading straight to Emerald Pines Hospital. Serena's condition has worsened."

The roses remained forgotten on the desk as Adrian strode out, his shadow stretching long across the marble floor. Somewhere in the city, two women waited - one in a luxury suite, the other in a hospital bed - both unknowingly bound by the same man's divided attention.
###Chapter 49

Adrian blinked, momentarily taken aback. "What about Mrs. Blackwood, then?"

His voice held steady conviction as he declared, "This is a matter of life and death. The priority is obvious."

Understanding flashed across Ethan's face, his expression dimming with reluctant acceptance.

"Make sure to get ninety-nine of those roses," Adrian added as a final instruction.

"Will do," Ethan replied, his tone layered with duty and unspoken questions. He wisely kept further inquiries to himself.

The dark pink blooms, exquisitely arranged in crisp white paper and delicate gauze, found their place on the passenger seat before Ethan returned to the florist.

Adrian examined the bouquet critically. These weren't ordinary red roses - their deeper hue and sophisticated wrapping caught the light with understated elegance.

Soon Ethan reappeared with a second bouquet, placing it carefully beside the first before sliding behind the wheel. The engine purred to life, and they were off.

The hospital stood mere minutes away, and they arrived in record time.

Ethan sprang from the driver's seat, opening the rear door with practiced efficiency.

Roses in hand, Adrian strode purposefully toward the bustling hospital entrance, their urgent progress discreetly captured by hidden cameras.

In the private room, Serena lay against the pillows, her complexion alarmingly pale. She brightened upon seeing Adrian, but her gaze immediately locked onto the flowers Ethan carried. "They're breathtaking!" she breathed, her weak smile radiating genuine delight.

She attempted to sit up, bracing on trembling elbows. "Don't exert yourself," Adrian urged, moving swiftly to support her head and gently guide her back down.

Miranda entered just then with medication, taking in the intimate scene. "You need your strength," she chided, concern sharpening her tone. "Blazing Horizon starts filming soon. How do you expect to lead the cast if you don't recover? We can't risk contract complications."

Ethan placed the roses on the bedside table and quietly withdrew.

Serena's fingers traced the velvety petals as she smiled at Miranda. "Always the worrier."

Adrian's brow furrowed as he broached the delicate subject. "Perhaps... it's time to consider stepping back. I can provide whatever you need. If acting remains your passion, producing might be a suitable alternative—"

Serena shook her head, her smile unwavering but eyes serious. "I'm not Vivian Hartley, Adrian. I could never be content relying on someone else. Whether it's the Blackwoods or others, they all assume I'm after your fortune—"

"Serena," Adrian cut in firmly, "I've never believed that, and their opinions shouldn't concern you."
###Chapter 50

Serena lowered her gaze, a bittersweet smile playing on her lips. "Even if I ignore their whispers, I can't escape my own insecurities. You've always intimidated me, Adrian. You're the dazzling sun while I'm just a forget-me-not in the shade. Acting... it gives me purpose. Makes me feel worthy enough to stand beside you, even if only as your friend."

Her voice faded into the quiet hospital room, laced with an exhaustion that went beyond physical.

"I get it," Adrian finally said, his deep voice cutting through the silence. He could never refuse her, not like he did with others. Carefully, he rearranged the cashmere blanket around Serena's shoulders. "But remember what Dr. Harrison said. I don't want you relapsing. And I respect your choices. Let Miranda handle the PR mess. If it's too much, I'll intervene."

Miranda exhaled sharply from her corner. "Serena's too pure for their viper's nest. Those tabloid rumors would've died naturally if..." She hesitated, then settled on, "That agent, Lydia Bennett, saw an opportunity. She leaked audition tapes, turned public opinion against us. The internet mobs are claiming Serena only got the role because of you." She studied Adrian's reaction carefully. "Funny how bold Lydia's become lately."

Adrian's jaw tightened visibly. With Lydia backing Vivian, the message was clear.

He'd initially believed Vivian was another victim caught in the gossip storm. His intervention had been meant to protect her too. But she'd used his goodwill as a weapon against Serena. The mask of gentleness had slipped completely.

Whatever lingering sympathy Adrian held for Vivian evaporated in that moment. Temporary anger he could forgive. Calculated cruelty? Never.

Soon after, Adrian arranged for a consultation with Isonridge's top cardiologist to develop a comprehensive treatment plan for Serena. He stayed until she finished her meal before finally leaving.

Outside, Ethan was pacing by the car. Seeing Adrian approach, he quickly opened the rear door. "Mr. Blackwood, are we still visiting Mrs. Blackwood?" Adrian ducked into the vehicle, the overpowering scent of roses assaulting his senses. His gaze flickered to the extravagant bouquet before he answered coldly, "Yes."

Ethan suppressed a shiver at his tone. This wasn't a reconciliation visit. This was war.

Meanwhile, at a 24-hour mart...

Vivian had spent the day deep-cleaning her apartment. Only when the sky turned cotton-candy pink did she realize she'd forgotten to eat. After grabbing dinner at a nearby bistro, she stopped for groceries on her way home.

Two years with Adrian had taught her one thing - the man had the palate of a Michelin critic. To avoid arguments, she'd religiously kept her beloved "trash food" out of their shared home.

At the checkout counter, temptation won. She ripped open a bag of sour cream chips right there, eyes closing in bliss at the first crunchy bite. Sometimes happiness came in greasy, MSG-laced packages.
###Chapter 51

The shopkeeper was glued to his tablet, but a headline flashing familiar names caught Vivian's eye. "Blackwood Group CEO seen rushing to hospital for Serena Whitmore - paparazzi photos spark engagement rumors!"

Vivian's chewing slowed as she stared at the screen. The footage showed Adrian Blackwood striding through hospital doors, his handsome face twisted with concern.

Noticing her interest, the shopkeeper chuckled. "That actress is always in the hospital lately, and he's always running after her. Don't these rich people have anything better to do?"

It was true - this marked Serena's third "emergency" hospitalization this month. The theatrics were becoming tiresomely predictable, yet Adrian kept falling for them every time.

"Must be true love," Vivian quipped lightly, finishing her snack.

The gossip instantly killed her shopping mood. She stepped toward the curb to hail a cab when a sleek Rolls-Royce pulled up abruptly beside her.

The tinted window lowered to reveal Adrian's striking but stormy expression.

"Did you release that audition tape?" His voice was tight with accusation.

Vivian's mind connected the dots instantly. Of course. Whenever his precious Serena faced any trouble, Adrian came running to blame her. The predictability was almost laughable.

Was she just his convenient punching bag? The thought made her blood boil.

Crossing her arms, she smirked down at him. "Yes, I did it. What of it? She keeps stepping on me to get ahead. Should I just take it lying down? Do I look like a damn welcome mat to you?"

Adrian's jaw clenched as he noticed the gathering onlookers. "Get in the car. You're making a scene."

Ethan quickly exited the vehicle to open the door. "Mrs. Blackwood—"

"So now I'm embarrassing you?" Vivian scoffed. "Just sign the divorce papers already. Then my actions won't reflect on the great Adrian Blackwood."

She stood her ground, making no move to enter.

At the word "divorce," Adrian's expression darkened. "Do what you want. But consider this your final warning - Serena's emotionally fragile. Stay away from her if you know what's good for you."

Vivian's laugh was bitter. "Oh, now I'm the one bothering her? Why don't you tell your precious Serena to stay the hell away from me? Or do you enjoy this little drama, Mr. Blackwood?"

"What nonsense are you spouting now?" Adrian massaged his temples. "I regret ever letting you into entertainment. It's changed you."

Every conversation with Vivian had become a battle - her words sharp as knives, always drawing blood.
###Chapter 52

Vivian arched an eyebrow at Adrian's blatant hypocrisy. "You despise the entertainment industry, yet your precious Serena thrives in it. And let's not forget - even as your wife, I'm still my own person. Since when did you earn the right to control my decisions? If I've done anything wrong, let the world judge me. Spare me your heroic act, Mr. Blackwood."

"Are these your award-winning acting skills? Starting petty arguments with your husband?" Adrian fired back without hesitation.

Vivian feigned innocence, her lips curling into a mocking smile. "Such sharp wit, Mr. Blackwood. How impressive."

The tension between them crackled like static before a thunderstorm. Ethan quickly stepped between them, hands raised in placation. "Mrs. Blackwood, I'm sure Mr. Blackwood didn't mean it that way. Perhaps this conversation would be better continued in the car?"

Vivian let out a derisive laugh. "Save your 'Mrs. Blackwood' formalities for your boss's darling Serena. That title means nothing to me."

With a dramatic swirl of her dress, Vivian turned to leave.

Ethan moved to block her path. "Mrs. Blackwood—"

"Move!"

"Let her go!"

Their voices clashed in perfect, furious harmony.

Ethan hesitated, caught between their conflicting commands, before finally stepping aside at Adrian's sharp nod.

"Sis, trouble in paradise? Did I just hear something about divorce?"

Vivian froze as Natasha materialized from nowhere, that infuriating smirk plastered across her face. The younger Dawson sister reached out to link arms, clearly having caught enough of the argument to smell blood in the water.

Vivian recoiled from the unwanted contact.

Undeterred, Natasha's gaze followed the departing Rolls-Royce. "Your husband certainly knows how to make a woman feel special, doesn't he? Just leaves you stranded on the sidewalk. Need a lift?"

At twenty-three, Natasha was Vivian's junior by exactly 364 days. Their father, Richard Dawson, had struck business gold when Vivian was five. His first act as a newly minted millionaire? Trading Vivian's mother Catherine for his mistress. The betrayal shattered Catherine, leading to her eventual suicide.

The true Dawson heiress had been shipped off to grandmother Eleanor's care. In their twisted family dynamic, Natasha had always been Vivian's nemesis. Despite the fortune built on Catherine's sacrifices, Vivian saw none of it - struggling even to cover Eleanor's medical bills. These desperate circumstances had forced her into a marriage of convenience with Adrian Blackwood, doomed from the start.

"Family? Don't make me laugh. My mother only had one daughter," Vivian spat before turning on her heel.

"What exactly makes you so superior, Vivian?" Natasha called after her, unwilling to let her escape so easily.
###Chapter 53

Natasha discarded all pretense of politeness, her lips curling into a sneer. "Even the most obscure relatives of the Blackwood family throw extravagant weddings, desperate to showcase their happiness. Yet you—married to the head of the Blackwood empire—have nothing but a legal document to show for it. Meanwhile, Crestwood's elite gush over Serena Whitmore as Adrian's soulmate, while you, the supposed Mrs. Blackwood, might as well be invisible."

Vivian froze mid-step, the barbed words striking deeper than she cared to admit. There was painful truth in Natasha's taunts. Her marriage to Adrian had begun as a cold business transaction, never intended for public consumption. When their original contract expired and her feelings had grown, she'd tentatively broached the subject of a ceremony. At first, Adrian had deflected with talk of his impossible schedule. Then came the brutal honesty—legal vows were sufficient, and anything more would be a frivolous waste of time.

Blinded by devotion, Vivian had swallowed her disappointment, convincing herself that quiet companionship mattered more than public displays. Now, facing Natasha's smirk, she recognized her own naivety. Forcing steel into her spine, Vivian crafted a razor-sharp smile. "A legal document still outranks your fantasies. The Blackwood name grants me privileges you'll never touch. In our world, hierarchy is everything."

She took a deliberate step forward, tilting her head with feline amusement. "Shall I demonstrate? With one word, I could have you exiled from Crestwood's social circles permanently."

Vivian watched with satisfaction as Natasha's confident mask fractured. With theatrical grace, she spread her hands in mock helplessness. "You're quite right about one thing—the Blackwood name does carry weight. A privilege your mother could only achieve in her wildest dreams."

Natasha's hands balled into fists, her manicured nails biting into her palms. "Don't flatter yourself, Vivian. The entire internet is obsessed with Adrian and Serena's reunion. Who exactly are you trying to impress? With her pedigree and charm, how long before Serena replaces you entirely?"

Her voice rose to a shrill pitch. "I may never be Mrs. Blackwood, but tell me this—how much longer will you hold that title?"

A rich baritone voice cut through the tension like a velvet knife. "For eternity."

Vivian whirled to see Adrian approaching, his broad shoulders silhouetted against the afternoon sun. Ethan trailed behind, cradling an armful of rare Ecuadorian roses that probably cost more than Natasha's monthly allowance.

Natasha's face drained of color, then flooded with angry blotches. "Adrian! I thought you'd left the event."

"I was retrieving flowers for my wife." Adrian's glacial gaze swept past Natasha as if she were invisible. "A concept your family seems to struggle with—loyalty."

The barb landed with precision. Vivian watched realization dawn on Natasha's face—all those tabloid rumors about Adrian's undying love for Serena, the whispers of impending divorce—shattered in this single moment. Here stood the notoriously private Adrian Blackwood, publicly claiming Vivian as his wife without hesitation.

Adrian motioned to Ethan, who presented the roses with a flourish. "Do they please you?" Adrian murmured, his stern features softening in a way Vivian hadn't seen since their argument that morning. The contrast between his earlier coldness and this tender display sent her pulse racing.

Natasha stood frozen, her earlier bravado crumbling. The message was unmistakable—while society might speculate about his affections, Adrian's actions spoke louder than any rumor. And right now, every carefully cultivated rose screamed his devotion to the woman society had written off.

Vivian accepted the bouquet, inhaling the heady fragrance to hide her trembling lips. The thorns pricked her fingers—a perfect metaphor for their marriage. Beautiful, intoxicating, and capable of drawing blood.

Adrian's hand settled possessively at the small of her back. "Shall we?" he asked, his tone leaving no room for Natasha's presence.

As they walked away, Vivian caught Natasha's reflection in a nearby mirror—the perfect image of a woman realizing she'd bet on the wrong horse. The sight sent a thrill through her veins sweeter than any victory speech.
###Chapter 54

The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the courtyard as Vivian studied the bouquet of crimson roses with guarded curiosity. Though Adrian's sudden display of affection confused her, she instinctively slipped into her well-practiced role of the doting wife. "How thoughtful of you to remember my favorite," she murmured, lifting the blooms to inhale their fragrance.

Her fingers traced the velvety petals as memories surfaced. Two years under Adrian's roof had granted her luxuries the Dawson name never provided. This stark reality made Natasha's mocking gaze unbearable. Performance wasn't merely Vivian's talent—it was her armor in this vipers' nest.

With calculated grace, she crossed to Adrian's side, threading her arm through his with practiced ease. "Thank you, darling," she purred, layering her voice with honeyed sweetness that made her own skin prickle. The unfamiliar endearment visibly startled him; she felt his muscles tense beneath the fine wool of his suit jacket.

Adrian's dark eyes held reluctant admiration for her acting prowess as they flicked toward Natasha. "Was there something else you needed, Miss Dawson? Or do you make a habit of eavesdropping on private conversations?"

Natasha's porcelain complexion flushed crimson. "I merely overheard talk of divorce proceedings, Mr. Blackwood. Naturally, I assumed—"

"A lovers' quarrel," Adrian interrupted with a dismissive wave. His thumb absently stroked Vivian's wrist as he continued, "Though I suppose gossip is more entertaining than academic pursuits. Pity your intellect doesn't match even half your sister's, despite sharing blood."

The verbal dagger found its mark. Natasha's carefully constructed composure shattered as she spun on her heel and fled, designer heels clicking sharply against the pavement.

The moment Natasha disappeared around the hedge, Vivian withdrew her arm as if burned. "Satisfied? Or did you come specifically to witness my humiliation?"

Adrian's brow furrowed. "Must you always assume the worst of me?"

She opened her mouth to retort, then bit back the scathing reply. He had, after all, just publicly defended her.

"There's a family gathering at Blackwood Manor tomorrow," he said after a weighted pause. "When you didn't answer my calls, I came to collect you personally."

A bitter laugh threatened to escape. Of course—now that he needed his contractual wife to maintain appearances, she suddenly warranted his attention. "We're getting divorced, Adrian," she said quietly, turning toward the fountain. "Your family will learn the truth eventually. Our arrangement expired months ago."

The words tasted like ash. Last year's complications—her father's scandal, Adrian's corporate takeover—had delayed the inevitable. Now, facing the hollow pretense of their marriage, Vivian recognized the futility of clinging to smoke and mirrors. The realization settled like a stone in her chest.

Adrian's expression darkened as he recalled Beatrice's distress. "Grandmother saw the news about the fire and this morning's tabloid photos with Serena. She's... concerned. We should reassure her together."

The unspoken plea in his voice gave Vivian pause. For all his ruthlessness in business, Adrian's devotion to his grandmother remained his one softness. She studied his face—the tension around his eyes, the stubborn set of his jaw—and found herself nodding despite better judgment.

"One last performance," she agreed, already calculating which dress would best sell the illusion of marital bliss. The irony didn't escape her—their entire relationship had been an elaborate act from the beginning.
###Chapter 55

Vivian felt the anger she'd nearly suppressed flare up again at his words. Did Adrian really expect her to explain herself? To assure Beatrice that all those tabloid photos of him with Serena were fabricated lies?

Yet she bit back her sharp retort. Beatrice held a special place in her heart.

She was the only Blackwood who had ever shown Vivian genuine warmth.

Vivian remembered the day she and Adrian had registered their marriage. Beatrice had pressed a delicate heirloom bracelet into her hands, publicly welcoming her into the family when others had only offered cold stares. That single act of kindness had given Vivian strength to endure the family's thinly veiled disdain.

In Beatrice's gentle affection, Vivian often saw echoes of Eleanor's unconditional love. It was this emotional debt that compelled her to visit Blackwood Manor tomorrow - to ease the older woman's worries.

Taking her silence as agreement, Adrian smoothly changed tactics. "Ethan mentioned you checked out of the hotel. Where are you staying? I can take you there. Or you could stay at Seabreeze Villa tonight to choose an outfit for tomorrow."

"No thank you," Vivian countered sharply, turning away. "I can manage."

Adrian didn't push further. With a slight tilt of his head, he murmured, "Ethan."

His assistant immediately stepped to the curb to hail a cab. Adrian's gaze returned to Vivian. "I'll pick you up tomorrow. Take my number off your block list."

"Unnecessary," Vivian fired back. "Exes should disappear completely. If it's urgent, Mr. Blackwood, you can email through Ethan."

Adrian chuckled, equal parts amused and exasperated. "Must you always be so cutting, Vivian? Doesn't this constant sparring exhaust you?"

Before she could respond, he snatched her phone with startling speed. Vivian lunged for it, but Adrian held it aloft, easily bypassing the lock screen - her oversight in never changing the passcode from his birthday.

She jumped repeatedly, but their height difference made it futile. Finally surrendering, Vivian stood fuming as Adrian not only unblocked his number but added himself back to her contacts before returning the phone.

Considering she might need to reach him tomorrow, Vivian reluctantly pocketed it without re-blocking him. She moved toward the waiting cab.

Ethan held the door open with practiced grace. "Mrs. Blackwood, your ride."

The taxi pulled away, leaving Adrian watching until it disappeared around the corner. His fingers absently traced the edge of his own phone where her new number now resided. Tomorrow couldn't come soon enough.
###Chapter 56

Vivian exchanged a fleeting, indecipherable glance with Adrian before silently approaching the sleek black limousine. With practiced elegance, she slid into the plush leather backseat.

"Mrs. Blackwood, your flowers." Ethan's crisp voice cut through the quiet just as Vivian settled in. Before she could voice her polite refusal, Ethan was already placing the lavish bouquet of blood-red roses beside her. The door clicked shut with finality as he told the driver, "Proceed to our destination."

Resigned, Vivian turned her face toward the tinted window, watching the cityscape blur past. The roses' heady fragrance pulled her from her thoughts, their velvety petals brushing against her arm.

These were the first flowers Adrian had ever given her. Yet instead of warmth, she felt only a hollow ache. Like finally receiving a long-desired gift only to find the magic had faded with waiting.

The next afternoon at precisely 3:15 PM, Vivian was smoothing the wrinkles from her designer dress when her phone vibrated - Adrian calling. Her fingers hovered momentarily before she suggested meeting at a discreet café in the adjacent gated community.

Ten minutes later, a text flashed on her screen: "Come down now."

Vivian exited through the private garden gate, her heels clicking against the cobblestones. The gleaming Maybach parked curbside drew admiring glances from passersby, its polished surface reflecting the afternoon sun.

As she reached for the passenger door, Ethan smoothly opened the rear instead. Inside, Adrian sat engrossed in his phone, his sharp profile illuminated by the screen's glow. Suppressing a sigh, Vivian slipped in beside him.

In the entertainment industry, hesitation was a luxury she couldn't afford. Lingering outside a luxury vehicle was an open invitation for paparazzi speculation.

"Take us to Opal Galleria first. She needs proper attire," Adrian remarked without looking up, his gaze briefly flickering over her outfit.

Vivian's chin lifted. "This is new. I'll wear what I choose."

"As you wish," Adrian conceded easily before instructing Ethan, "Proceed directly to Blackwood Manor then."

The car purred to life as Adrian resumed his phone conversation, effectively dismissing her presence. Grateful for the reprieve, Vivian pulled out her own device to finalize negotiations with Ivory Phoenix Productions.

The drive passed swiftly, the Maybach gliding through Crestwood's elite neighborhoods. When they arrived, Vivian lingered by the open car door, watching Adrian still absorbed in his call. "We're here," she murmured.

"You go ahead. I'll join you after this conference call," he muttered, fingers flying across his screen.

Vivian turned toward the imposing Blackwood Manor gates, her stomach tightening. Each visit here filled her with unease despite her affection for Beatrice. The Blackwoods had spent years vetting suitable matches for Adrian, only for Vivian - an outsider from modest means - to become his wife.

To them, she would always be the opportunistic upstart, enduring their veiled barbs whenever Beatrice wasn't looking. As she approached the grand entrance, the doors stood ominously ajar, snippets of conversation drifting out.

"Aunt Margaret, have you seen Vivian's latest publicity stunt? If Adrian was determined to marry beneath him, he might as well have chosen Serena. At least she's making waves internationally, not embarrassing herself in those tacky dramas..."
###Chapter 57

The tension in the room was palpable as Bianca Thornton leaned forward, her manicured nails tapping impatiently against the armrest. "Honestly, Margaret. When Adrian returns, you must speak with him. We're hemorrhaging resources supporting Vivian while she's off playing actress, making our family the laughingstock of Crestwood's elite!"

Three figures occupied the lavish sitting room of Seabreeze Villa - Bianca, her father Victor Thornton, and Margaret Blackwood, Adrian's mother. Margaret sat perfectly poised on the velvet sofa, her expression unreadable beneath her expertly applied makeup.

The Thornton family's once-thriving business empire had crumbled to near ruin, a far cry from its former glory. As a Thornton by birth, Margaret felt obligated to assist, though the Blackwoods had always maintained strict boundaries between family and business affairs.

Victor, with his limited education and questionable judgment, had proven disastrous in corporate matters. Neither Leonard Blackwood nor his grandson Adrian had any interest in involving Victor in Blackwood Group's operations. Margaret, unfamiliar with business intricacies, could only offer her brother occasional financial assistance for daily expenses.

Over time, Victor's ambitions shifted. Years ago, he began aggressively introducing potential brides to Adrian, hoping to secure a marriage that would benefit the Thornton family through powerful connections. Then, as if fate enjoyed mocking them, shortly after Serena Whitmore's departure, Vivian Hartley appeared!

This year had been particularly brutal. The Thorntons' investments collapsed spectacularly, leaving them drowning in debt. Unable to blame Adrian for refusing to bail them out, Victor and Bianca redirected their frustration toward Vivian.

When Vivian entered, she immediately noted Leonard and Beatrice's absence. Approaching the group with calculated grace, her greeting dripped with sarcasm. "Victor, Bianca, how touching that you'd concern yourselves with my career while your family teeters on bankruptcy's edge."

The old Vivian would have shrunk under their scrutiny, playing the meek pushover. This new version struck back with razor-sharp precision, leaving them momentarily speechless.

Victor recovered first with a hollow chuckle. "Vivian, you haven't even become famous yet, but your ego's already inflated."

"Thank you for the vote of confidence, Victor. I do intend to make quite the name for myself," Vivian countered with a saccharine smile.

She turned to Margaret, her smile dimming slightly. "Margaret."

Adorned in a couture silk gown from the latest Emerald Galleria collection, Margaret Blackwood was the picture of aristocratic elegance. At nearly fifty, she maintained her figure through rigorous discipline, her complexion flawless enough to pass for a woman fifteen years younger.

Margaret acknowledged Vivian with a curt nod. "Hmm."

Beside Margaret, Bianca sat dressed in a coordinating ensemble that created a mother-daughter illusion. She crossed her arms, smirking. "So where's Adrian? Off chasing Serena again while you're left behind?"

Unfazed, Vivian settled into an armchair with deliberate ease. "It doesn't trouble me. Adrian can spend time with whomever he chooses. Much like his friend Dominic, always seen with a different woman on each arm. Who could possibly manage that?"

Bianca's face contorted violently, her carefully constructed composure shattering. Her unrequited obsession with Dominic Sinclair was society's worst-kept secret, a constant source of humiliation among their peers. Unable to refute the undeniable truth, Bianca abruptly changed tactics, her voice sharp as broken glass.
###Chapter 58

"Vivian, what in heaven's name are you wearing?" Bianca sneered, her eyes raking over Vivian's outfit with obvious contempt. "The Blackwoods are known for their sophistication, yet you show up looking like some common shopgirl."

"Honestly, I don't understand how living with Adrian hasn't improved your fashion sense one bit. You still carry that provincial air about you." Bianca's voice oozed disdain as she examined Vivian's simple attire.

Vivian wore an affordable cashmere sweater in chestnut brown from a popular high-street brand, paired with tailored taupe trousers that embodied understated elegance. The entire ensemble cost less than five hundred sterlings - a stark contrast to the Blackwood mansion's opulence.

Adrian's earlier warning echoed in Vivian's mind, making her regret not taking his advice more seriously. Just as self-doubt crept in, Adrian himself entered the room. "Bianca, show some respect. She's family now," he interjected coolly, barely glancing at his cousin before addressing Margaret. "Mother."

"Adrian—" Bianca's haughty demeanor instantly crumbled at the sound of his voice. Of all their relatives, he was the one she feared most.

Adrian's voice turned steely, cutting through the tension in the room. "I asked you a question. Did you hear me?"

"Yes," Bianca muttered, her gaze dropping to the floor in reluctant submission.

Only then did Adrian's expression soften as he turned to admire Vivian. A proud smile touched his lips. "Only insecure people need designer labels to feel important. Vivian could wear a potato sack and still outshine everyone in this room."

Victor and Bianca exchanged frustrated glances but remained silent. Pushing further would only provoke Adrian's wrath.

Their awkward silence was broken by Leonard and Beatrice's arrival. The elderly couple made a striking entrance in matching ivory suits, clearly custom-made by that legendary Savile Row tailor who once dressed European royalty. Each piece was practically a museum-worthy collector's item.

Though retired for years, Leonard still commanded respect with his mere presence. Victor visibly tensed, acutely aware of his father-in-law's disapproval, while Beatrice radiated the serene confidence of someone who'd spent decades cultivating inner peace.

When Beatrice's eyes landed on Vivian, they filled with gentle concern. "Come here, dear, let me see how you're doing," she beckoned warmly.

Vivian approached them respectfully, nodding to Leonard before taking Beatrice's hands in hers. "Beatrice, I'm perfectly fine now, really," she assured the older woman. "Leonard, Beatrice."

Bianca trailed behind, shooting Vivian a venomous look and mouthing "Teacher's pet" under her breath. Vivian noticed but ignored it - her affection for Beatrice was genuine, not some calculated social maneuver.

Adrian smoothly intervened with an update to ease their worries. "Grandmother, there's no need for concern. I've arranged for Vivian to consult with Frostholm's leading dermatologist - an expert in scar treatment - when he visits Crestwood next week for the medical conference."

Vivian's eyelashes fluttered slightly at this news, though her expression remained composed. Adrian never hesitated to provide the best care money could buy.

The tension in the room thickened as unspoken rivalries simmered beneath polite conversation. Vivian stood quietly, acutely aware of being both the center of attention and an outsider in this powerful family's dynamic.

Adrian's hand found the small of her back in silent support, his touch conveying more reassurance than words ever could. In that moment, Vivian realized no amount of designer clothing could ever compare to having his unwavering protection.
###Chapter 59

The scars from the fire had long since healed, yet Adrian hadn't once asked about Vivian's recovery. His silence spoke volumes about the icy distance between them. To Adrian, dispatching his assistant to arrange medical care was clearly less taxing than feigning concern in person.

Dinner unfolded with effortless ease, the Blackwood family's laughter washing away the day's earlier tension. Vivian remained quiet, speaking only when addressed directly. As she reached for the black pepper steak, Beatrice stopped her abruptly. "That's too spicy for you, dear. It could irritate your scars."

Bianca's eyes sparkled with mischief as she swapped Vivian's plate with her own milder dish. "You should be careful, Vivian. We wouldn't want anything compromising your on-screen appearance."

Beatrice's brows knitted in confusion. "On-screen appearance?"

The elderly couple, blissfully detached from modern digital trends, looked genuinely puzzled. Vivian opened her mouth to explain, but Bianca cut in swiftly. "Vivian's been dabbling in acting lately. Though she didn't land the role, it's already causing quite a stir online—"

"Enough," Adrian interjected, his voice sharp as winter frost.

Beatrice shot him a warning glance before turning back to Bianca. "What sort of stir?"

Bianca swallowed hard under Adrian's glare. "It's not my fault, Adrian! Listen, Beatrice—Vivian auditioned against Adrian's ex-girlfriend for the same role. When Vivian didn't get it, she became social media's favorite punching bag. Thank heavens their marriage isn't public knowledge, or Blackwood Group's stocks might have suffered."

Beatrice's expression darkened like gathering storm clouds.

She turned to Adrian, frustration coloring her tone. "Adrian, that woman is your past. Vivian is your present—your wife. Can't you see where your loyalty should lie?"

Leonard, silent until now, added his measured voice. "Even if your marriage isn't public, our family and friends know. Don't make this mistake again."

Bianca shrank back, unprepared for the united front defending Vivian.

Adrian exhaled slowly, picking up the serving utensils to place a delicate piece of fish on Beatrice's plate. "Understood," he murmured.

"Words are easy, Adrian," Beatrice retorted, tapping his hand sharply. The red mark bloomed instantly. "Stop fussing over me and tend to your wife. Her favorite beef dish sits untouched across the table."

Following her pointed instruction, Adrian served Vivian a slice of beef. Watching his uncharacteristic compliance, Vivian couldn't suppress an amused smile.

Noticing her expression, Adrian added a plump shrimp to her plate, his gaze softening. "Find my scolding entertaining?" he teased.

Vivian took a delicate bite, her lips curving. "The shrimp is particularly delicious tonight."
###Chapter 60

The tension between them had finally begun to ease when Adrian felt an unexpected impulse to bridge the distance. "Tonight, I want to—"

His words were abruptly cut off by the shrill ringing of his phone—an unusual breach of etiquette for someone who always kept his devices silent during meals. The sudden interruption made everyone at the table turn toward him.

Vivian's eyes flickered to the glowing screen where the name "Serena" flashed prominently.

Adrian answered with his usual composure, but as the call progressed, his expression hardened into unreadable stone. Whatever news came through the line carried palpable weight. "Understood," was all he said before ending the call.

Standing abruptly, he addressed the table. "I need to go to the office immediately."

Margaret's sharp gaze darted between him and Vivian. "Must it be now? Can't this wait until after dinner? You're just going to leave Vivian here alone?"

His decision was already made. Finishing his meal in three efficient bites, Adrian rose. "Ethan will take you home," he told Vivian in a tone that brooked no argument.

"Drive safely," Vivian replied softly, her smile serene but her eyes turning glacial. Her grip on the fork tightened almost imperceptibly—just enough for her knuckles to whiten. The mere appearance of Serena's name had shattered whatever fragile peace they'd begun to build.

The moment Adrian's car disappeared down the driveway, Bianca broke the silence. "That was Serena, wasn't it?" Her voice dripped with faux concern.

Vivian's retort was razor-sharp. "Since when did you become a gossip columnist?"

Bianca's lips curled into a condescending smirk. "Just looking out for you, cousin. Lose your husband's attention, and you'll regret it."

Margaret, who had been quietly observing, set down her utensils with deliberate precision. "Bianca isn't wrong," she said, her piercing gaze locking onto Vivian. "A wife's priority should be her husband and family. Chasing fame at your age is foolish. A child would secure your position."

Her eyes dropped meaningfully to Vivian's abdomen. "Two years of marriage with no pregnancy suggests you might need medical intervention."

Adrian hadn't touched her since their wedding night—if she conceived now, it would be nothing short of divine intervention.

Vivian's response was measured. "Conception requires participation from both parties."

Margaret's eyes flashed with disbelief. The meek girl who used to absorb every barbed comment had just thrown one back. The shift was as startling as a slap.

Turning to Beatrice, Margaret's voice trembled with indignation. "Are you hearing this? I barely said anything, and she's talking back!"

Beatrice patted Margaret's hand with the gentle finality of a sunset. "Times change, dear. Remember, you didn't have Adrian until five years into your marriage."

"That was different," Margaret muttered, but the fight had left her voice.
###Chapter 61

Vivian shifted her gaze toward Beatrice with a welcoming smile. "Vivian, have you eaten enough?"

"Yes, thank you," Vivian answered with a courteous nod. "Did you need something from me?"

Beatrice rose from her seat, her voice warm and encouraging. "I have a special salve for scars that might help you. Come to my chambers, and I'll demonstrate its application."

Vivian stood immediately to assist. "Certainly, Beatrice. I'd be delighted."

Margaret observed their departure with a disapproving sniff before turning her maternal attention to Bianca. "Bianca, you must stay the night. I want to hear all about your recent endeavors," she said, her tone noticeably softening now that Vivian was no longer present.

Vivian caught a fleeting glimpse of their affectionate exchange before carefully guiding Beatrice up the staircase, each step measured and deliberate.

Inside Beatrice's intimate bedchamber, the older woman secured the door before approaching an antique mahogany table. She lifted an exquisitely carved wooden box containing an assortment of delicate glass vials that seemed to hold centuries of wisdom.

"These were formulated by a renowned herbalist in Frostholm," Beatrice explained, her voice carrying quiet reverence. "While modern medicine has its merits, these ancient remedies preserve our ancestors' knowledge." She meticulously explained each ointment's purpose before returning them to their velvet-lined compartments.

Vivian accepted the box with both hands, its physical weight mirroring the emotional burden in her chest. "Thank you, Beatrice," she murmured, her gratitude laced with underlying tension.

Beatrice's kindness felt simultaneously soothing and painful. Vivian knew this generosity stemmed from her position as Adrian's wife - a role she was preparing to relinquish. Accepting such genuine care while concealing her plans filled her with leaden guilt.

Drawing a steadying breath, Vivian finally broke the silence, her voice wavering slightly. "Beatrice, there's something I must confess..."

"Adrian and I have never consummated our marriage." The admission spilled forth, hanging heavily in the air between them. As the words lingered, Vivian experienced both unsettling vulnerability and profound relief from her long-carried secret.

Beatrice's benevolent expression stiffened mid-smile. She recalled Margaret's earlier comments about Vivian and grandchildren. Suddenly, the absence of pregnancy announcements made dreadful sense. Her face transformed into a mask of compassionate distress, with rising indignation toward Adrian.

Clasping Vivian's hands firmly, Beatrice's grip offered both strength and comfort. "Adrian married you, accepting the sacred duty to honor and cherish you. That he's neglected this responsibility for two years is unconscionable! Don't fret, dear - he'll hear my thoughts on this matter!"

Feeling the warmth of Beatrice's hands, Vivian returned the gentle pressure, her voice surprisingly composed. "Please, Beatrice, don't be angry. There's more I need to share."

With another deep breath, Vivian began recounting the painful realities of her marriage - Adrian's relentless emotional neglect in his obsession with Serena, and their recent reconciliation. Each revelation felt like tearing open half-healed wounds, and before she could stop them, hot tears streamed down her cheeks, betraying her carefully maintained composure.

Beatrice tenderly dabbed Vivian's tears with her embroidered handkerchief. "Hush now, darling. We failed in raising Adrian properly. He's always been secretive and headstrong, but I never imagined he could be so cruel..."

Her voice trailed off as fresh understanding dawned. The implications of Vivian's confession settled heavily between them, the comfortable bedroom suddenly feeling charged with unspoken consequences. Outside the window, twilight deepened, casting long shadows that seemed to mirror the dark truths now revealed.
###Chapter 62

Vivian's words faded into the heavy silence, followed by a deep sigh. Beatrice, seeking to comfort her, gently squeezed Vivian's hand. "I understand completely."

"Adrian only has eyes for Serena. Now that they've reunited, you'll likely have a great-grandchild soon."

At the mention of Serena, Beatrice's expression turned stony with disapproval. "Absolutely not! That woman could never replace you in my heart. To me, you're the only granddaughter I'll ever accept. As long as I draw breath, I won't allow him to marry Serena!" Her voice grew louder with each word, thick with righteous anger, until Vivian intervened with calm determination.

"Beatrice, you can't force love. I'm telling you this because I respect you too much to keep pretending. Please don't be upset. The truth is... Adrian and I were never meant to be together."

Vivian's gaze dropped to the polished marble floor, her voice heavy with resignation. Seeing her resolve, Beatrice knew no argument would change her mind. That foolish Adrian didn't deserve such a remarkable woman. Let him regret his choices later! Perhaps Vivian would find true happiness without him.

"Very well, my dear," Beatrice said softly, her voice warm with affection. "If divorce is what you want, I won't stand in your way. But remember this—whether you're family by law or not, you'll always have a home here. Promise you'll visit Leonard and me often. The Blackwood Estate will always keep your room ready."

After saying her goodbyes to Beatrice and Leonard, Vivian slid into Ethan's waiting car. As they passed through the wrought iron gates, Ethan glanced over with concern. "Mrs. Blackwood, where shall I take you?"

"Just pull over here," Vivian replied, gathering the gifts Beatrice had insisted she take. Ethan's worry was palpable.

"But Mrs. Blackwood, taxis rarely come through Crestwood's private roads. It'll be difficult—"

"My agent is meeting me nearby," Vivian cut in firmly.

After a tense pause, Ethan reluctantly opened the door. "If you need anything at all, please call me immediately."

Vivian walked away without responding, her figure soon swallowed by the gathering shadows. Ethan reached for his phone to call Adrian, but the call wouldn't connect. Remembering it was Serena's contract signing day, he turned the car toward Ivory Phoenix Productions.

Meanwhile, Vivian hadn't gone far when her phone buzzed. Lydia sounded harried. "Vivian, my car just died! I'm waiting for roadside assistance—no idea how long this will take. You'll need to find your own way back."

"No problem," Vivian replied calmly before hanging up. She turned back instinctively, but Ethan's car had already disappeared into the night.

The Blackwood Estate crowned Crestwood's most exclusive neighborhood, its sprawling grounds dominating the wooded hillside. The winding private road stretched endlessly before her, flanked by towering oaks that whispered in the gathering wind. Storm clouds blotted out the moon, and an unseasonable chill seeped through her coat as she quickened her pace.

After twenty minutes of walking, the distant glow of city lights finally appeared through the trees. Relief flooded her—civilization couldn't be more than half a mile away.

###Chapter 63

The storm broke with theatrical suddenness just as Vivian Hartley's phone chimed with her ride confirmation. Lightning split the sky like a photographer's flash, followed by thunder that vibrated through her bones. Marble-sized raindrops began assaulting the pavement with violent precision.

Vivian lifted her designer handbag overhead in a futile attempt at protection and sprinted toward the curb. Within seconds, her silk blouse became translucent against her skin, her Jimmy Choos ruined beyond salvation, and her carefully styled waves transformed into a dripping mess.

A white Toyota Prius—her booked ride—appeared through the curtain of rain. But before she could reach it, a sleek black Bentley materialized like a panther cutting through the storm. The door swung open to reveal Ethan Caldwell holding an umbrella large enough to shelter three people.

"Get in." Adrian Blackwood's command sliced through the rain from inside the vehicle, his tone leaving no room for negotiation.

Vivian spared Adrian only the briefest glance—the kind one might give a particularly uninteresting lamppost—before deliberately stepping back into the downpour. She moved with purpose toward her waiting Prius, rain streaming down her determined face.

"Mrs. Blackwood, Mr. Blackwood specifically came to—" Ethan's protest died on his lips as he watched her retreating figure.

Adrian exited the Bentley without a word. In three long strides, he intercepted Vivian just as her fingers touched the Prius door handle. With one sharp motion, he slammed it shut.

"What the hell—" Vivian's outrage turned to shock as Adrian swept her off her feet effortlessly. Her protests were swallowed by another thunderclap as he carried her back to his car.

"Put me down this instant!" She writhed like an angry cat in his arms, her voice rising above the storm. "Since when does the great Adrian Blackwood resort to kidnapping women in broad daylight?"

Her struggles proved useless against his strength. Adrian deposited her gently but firmly into the Bentley's leather backseat before sliding in beside her. His designer suit now bore damp patches from their brief excursion, and his nose wrinkled slightly at the sight.

Vivian's ruined makeup created dark streaks down her cheeks, and her soaked hair dripped steadily onto the Bentley's custom wool carpets. Each drop spread like ink on parchment, staining the luxury interior.

Ethan, ever the efficient assistant, immediately adjusted the climate control and produced a monogrammed towel from the console. "Mrs. Blackwood," he offered smoothly, "you'll catch cold."

Adrian watched her futile attempts at damage control with amusement. "That was quite the performance," he remarked, brushing rainwater from his sleeve. "Did you enjoy your dramatic exit?"

Vivian paused mid-pat, fixing him with a glare that could melt steel. "If someone hadn't decided to play knight in shining armor, I'd be halfway home by now." Her voice cracked slightly despite her best efforts. "Tell me, Adrian, is this how you treat all women? Dragging them places against their will?"

The memory of being abandoned at that gala for Serena Whitmore rose unbidden, making her eyes burn. Normally so composed, Vivian's face now betrayed the storm inside her—eyes glittering with unshed tears, lips pressed into a thin line of defiance. The raindrops on her lashes could almost pass for tears, but everyone in that car knew Vivian Hartley never cried. Not anymore.
###Chapter 64

The quiet elegance she once possessed had hidden her radiance, but now she held his attention completely, softening the edges of his hardened heart in ways he never anticipated.

Adrian's tone gentled as he confessed, "I didn't leave you behind because of another woman. The Blackwood Group needed me - this wasn't just about money, but decisions requiring my personal authorization." Such vulnerability was rare from him.

Vivian knew he meant his negotiations with Blazing Horizon. Yet a bitter thought crept in - wasn't this just another polished excuse regarding Serena? How different was this from choosing Serena over her?

His explanations felt meaningless now. Since deciding on divorce, his business affairs and justifications had become irrelevant. Turning away, she focused on drying her hair, letting silence stretch between them like an unbridgeable chasm.

Ignoring Adrian's attempts at reconciliation, Vivian instructed Ethan to take her to the community center near her new apartment. The driver hesitated, glancing at Adrian for direction.

Adrian hadn't expected his honesty to backfire so spectacularly. His jaw tightened as frustration simmered beneath his controlled exterior.

Recognizing the impasse, Ethan relied on years of experience serving the Blackwoods to make an executive decision.

Fifteen minutes later, Vivian looked out the rain-streaked window with growing unease. The familiar route triggered recognition - they were heading toward Seabreeze Villa.

"Ethan!" Her voice sharpened. "You're going the wrong way. Turn around immediately!"

Through the rearview mirror, Ethan saw Adrian's impassive reflection and maintained course toward the villa.

"Did you not hear me?" Vivian's fist struck the leather seat. "I said take me home!"

The car continued moving forward, tires hissing against wet pavement.

Feeling disregarded by both men, Vivian regretted ever entering the vehicle. Her fingers found the door handle - unlocked. Without hesitation, she pulled it open.

Icy wind and stinging rain assaulted her as she leaned out. Before she could act, powerful arms dragged her back into the warmth of the car.

Ethan slammed the brakes, swerving violently. A road sign shattered against a stone pillar where they'd nearly crashed. Without Adrian's quick reflexes, Vivian might have shared that sign's fate.

Fear pulsed through her veins, but she schooled her features into icy composure, refusing to show weakness.

As the car stilled, tension thickened the air. Trapped securely in Adrian's embrace, Vivian craned her neck to meet his gaze. His eyes burned with fury before cooling into something distant and unreadable.

The storm outside mirrored the tempest between them, neither willing to surrender first.
###Chapter 65

The tension in the car was suffocating.

Vivian's voice sliced through the storm, sharp as broken glass. "Release me this instant!"

Rain lashed against the windows, her damp hair clinging to pale cheeks that made her look like a drowned kitten. The storm outside mirrored the tempest between them.

Adrian didn't flinch. With one fluid motion, he slammed the car door shut, his glacial stare pinning her in place. "If you're determined to end your miserable existence, pick a cleaner method. Tumbling from a moving vehicle will only leave you broken, not dead. Spare me the inconvenience of dealing with your mangled remains."

Her laugh was bitter. "How considerate, Mr. Blackwood. Once those divorce papers are signed, my wellbeing won't concern you - whether I'm whole or in pieces."

Something dangerous flickered in his eyes. Before she could react, his mouth crashed against hers in a punishing kiss, swallowing her gasp of outrage.

Ethan's grip tightened on the steering wheel. Without missing a beat, he activated the privacy partition, sealing the warring couple in their velvet-lined battlefield.

The kiss was all teeth and dominance, Adrian's hands like steel bands around her wrists. Vivian twisted against him, humiliation burning through her veins. After two years of marriage, this was the closest they'd ever been - and it tasted like punishment.

She remembered the silk negligee she'd bought during their first month together, the way it had ended up in the trash bin by dawn. The discreet doctor's visit that confirmed her worst fear - her husband's revulsion was personal, not physical.

Now, on the precipice of freedom, he'd suddenly developed the appetite of a starved man. His lips moved with bruising intensity, his body pressing her into the leather seats. The scent of rain and her jasmine perfume seemed to intoxicate him, his grip shifting from restraint to possession.

Vivian bit down hard.

Adrian jerked back, a droplet of blood blooming on his lower lip. His eyes darkened with something primal. "You'll pay for that."

"Try me," she spat, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand. "I'm not your obedient little wife anymore."

A dangerous smile curved his lips as he reached for her again. This time, his touch was different - deliberate, almost tender. His thumb brushed the pulse point at her wrist, feeling it leap beneath his fingers.

The contradiction made her breath hitch.

When his mouth found hers again, the kiss transformed. No longer about punishment, but something far more dangerous. His tongue traced the seam of her lips with devastating patience, waiting for her surrender.

Against her will, her body remembered what her mind refused to acknowledge - this was the man she'd loved desperately for years. A soft sound escaped her throat, barely audible over the rain.

Adrian made a rough noise of satisfaction, his hands sliding up to cradle her face. The gentleness was worse than violence. It unraveled her defenses, made her fingers clutch at his shirt instead of pushing him away.

The partition remained firmly closed as the car sped through the storm, carrying them toward an uncertain future. Outside, lightning split the sky - a perfect metaphor for the electricity crackling between them.

Neither noticed when the rain stopped.
###Chapter 66

Her silken skin burned against his.

When she attempted to push him away, her delicate fingers grazed his chest, igniting a wildfire of desire within him.

Adrian's breath turned ragged as his hand crept beneath her blouse.

Her previously chilled flesh now radiated unnatural heat.

Was she running a fever?

The realization cut through his haze of lust like a blade. With tremendous effort, he wrenched himself away despite the primal urges coursing through him.

"Damn it, Vivian!" He delivered a sharp swat to her backside, his voice rough with frustration. "This is what you wanted, isn't it? Look what you've done to yourself!"

Humiliation and fury painted Vivian's cheeks crimson. Without hesitation, her palm connected with Adrian's cheek in a stinging slap.

The sound echoed through the car's interior like a gunshot.

Adrian's expression darkened dangerously. His fingers became iron shackles around her wrist, his eyes promising retribution. "Vivian Hartley!" he snarled through clenched teeth.

Lately, she'd been testing his patience at every turn, challenging the very foundations of his control.

For years, Adrian Blackwood had commanded boardrooms and inspired terror in competitors.

Yet this slip of a woman reduced him to this raw, uncontrolled state.

Vivian's wrist bloomed red beneath his punishing grip. "What now?" she spat, her voice trembling with defiance. "Going to teach me a lesson? Your silent treatment wasn't punishment enough?"

"You think I won't?" Adrian's grip shifted to her throat, cutting off her air supply.

Vivian's lips parted in a soundless gasp, but her eyes—those magnificent, furious eyes—held nothing but unbroken rebellion.

Her complexion had gone deathly pale, the only color remaining in her bloodshot eyes.

A single tear escaped, scalding his fingers as it traced a path down her cheek.

The sight jolted Adrian back to reality. What was he doing? He'd faced armed mercenaries without flinching, yet this woman's defiance unraveled him completely.

Releasing her abruptly, he slammed the privacy partition up with unnecessary force. "Seabreeze Villa. Now," he barked at Ethan, his voice glacial.

Ethan's forehead gleamed with nervous sweat as he quickly obeyed. "Right away, sir."

Vivian scrambled to the far side of the limousine, putting maximum distance between them. Her wary gaze darted about like a cornered animal's. Adrian deliberately turned toward the rain-streaked window, finding perverse comfort in the rhythmic patter against the glass.

When they arrived at the villa, Adrian discovered Vivian had succumbed to feverish unconsciousness. Her forehead burned beneath his touch. Even in sleep, she remained restless—whimpering softly, fresh tears mingling with the dried tracks on her cheeks.

His expression grim, Adrian hauled her into his arms with none of his usual care. The abrupt movement made her stir slightly, her body shifting against his. That slight friction reignited the embers of desire he'd struggled to suppress. His arms tightened instinctively, as if afraid she might vanish into the night.

The storm outside mirrored the tempest raging within him.
###Chapter 67

The moment Adrian noticed Vivian's feverish state, his jaw tightened. Ethan hovered nearby, concern etching his features. "Mrs. Blackwood seems quite unwell. Shouldn't we call an ambulance?"

At the mention of medical help, Vivian's fingers curled into Adrian's tailored jacket with surprising strength. "No hospitals," she rasped, her voice barely audible yet laced with panic.

Adrian's gaze darkened as he considered their options. "Contact Dr. Harrison for a house call," he instructed curtly. "Wait downstairs."

Without another word, he carried Vivian up the sweeping staircase to their shared bedroom. The mansion stood eerily silent, the staff having retired for the evening. His eyes dropped to her soaked dress clinging to her trembling form.

Moving with uncharacteristic gentleness, Adrian pulled the silk duvet back and laid her down. The unfamiliar act of caregiving made his movements awkward. He raked a hand through his hair, clearly out of his depth.

Storming to the walk-in closet, Adrian selected a set of satin pajamas. When he returned, Vivian's glassy eyes fluttered open. The room spun in her fevered vision, but she'd recognize these four walls anywhere.

As Adrian approached with the sleepwear, she blinked slowly. This couldn't be real. The Adrian Blackwood showing concern? Her delirious mind must be playing tricks.

When he began helping her change, her body stiffened instinctively. The memory of their tense car ride still fresh. Noticing her hesitation, Adrian exhaled sharply. "You'll catch pneumonia in these wet clothes. Change."

"Fine," Vivian murmured, too exhausted to argue with her hallucination. Her fingers fumbled with the buttons.

Adrian turned his back abruptly, his shoulders rigid. That familiar distance - even in her dreams, he maintained it. Their entire marriage flashed before her eyes - every cold interaction, every transaction disguised as affection.

She changed quickly and burrowed beneath the covers. The Egyptian cotton sheets caressed her overheated skin, a luxury she'd never take for granted. Sleep claimed her almost instantly.

Adrian lingered in the doorway, watching the steady rise and fall of her chest. His gaze dropped to the discarded dress pooling on the floor.

"What the hell am I doing?" he muttered to the empty room.

Morning light filtered through the curtains when Vivian awoke. Her head pounded as she took in the lavish bedroom. Fragments of last night surfaced - Adrian's unexpected tenderness. She pressed her palms to her temples.

"Two years of marriage and I'm still dreaming up fairy tales," she whispered bitterly.

A knock interrupted her thoughts. Before she could respond, the door swung open. A stern-faced woman in a crisp uniform entered bearing a breakfast tray.

"Who are you?" Vivian croaked, pushing herself upright.

The stranger set the tray down with practiced efficiency. "Mrs. Harrington, the new housekeeper. Mr. Blackwood insisted you eat before taking your medication."

Vivian's breath caught. So it hadn't been a dream after all.
###Chapter 68

The maid entered with a silver tray, her steps measured and her lips curled in undisguised disdain. "Mr. Blackwood ordered me to tend to you," she declared, her voice laced with thinly veiled contempt.

Vivian blinked at the servant's brazen disrespect toward the lady of the house. Adrian's loathing for her ran so deep that even newly hired staff felt entitled to treat her with such open disregard. This wasn't care - it was damage control, like assigning someone to babysit an inconvenient problem. While Serena had mastered the art of feigning illness for attention - and Adrian would move heaven and earth for her - he'd casually palmed off his own wife's care to a servant during her fever.

"Leave. I need to shower," Vivian said dismissively, throwing back the silk sheets.

The maid stood rooted to the spot.

"Mr. Blackwood insisted you take medication after breakfast."

Vivian's voice turned glacial. "Adrian asked you to assist me, not command me."

The maid's expression faltered. "Excuse me?" Without missing a beat, Vivian countered, "I remain his wife. Basic courtesy would be appreciated."

When the maid remained silent, Vivian added with finality, "Enough. You're dismissed. I won't ask again."

The maid flushed but didn't dare argue, eventually turning on her heel. Alone at last, Vivian exhaled and headed for the ensuite. After showering and changing into fresh clothes, she grabbed her purse and phone, pausing to check the hallway - empty.

Perfect.

She quickly summoned a ride and slipped out like a fugitive. The crisp morning air revived her, but her brief respite shattered when her phone began vibrating incessantly. Sliding into the waiting cab, she fished out her phone, her stomach dropping at the caller ID. Richard.

Vivian's jaw tightened as unwanted memories surfaced. In the early days of her marriage to Adrian, Richard had hounded her relentlessly, exploiting their blood ties to demand favors - insider stock tips, business connections, high-society invitations for Natasha to land a rich husband. But Vivian had never been one to be manipulated, least of all by Richard. Her refusals were absolute. When it became clear she wouldn't play along, he'd dropped the charade of fatherly affection.

Two years of radio silence. And now this. The timing was obvious - their recent encounter combined with divorce rumors had reignited his interest. The phone vibrated again, about to disconnect. Against her better judgment, she answered, her voice arctic. "What do you want?"

Richard launched into his trademark guilt trip, his words barbed with accusation. "Two years without visiting your own father, and now that you've climbed the social ladder, you've forgotten your family. You truly are heartless—"

As Richard's tirade continued, Vivian subtly held the phone away, her gaze drifting to the cab window.

On the sidewalk, an elderly gentleman approached a young woman exiting a boutique, her arms laden with shopping bags. With tender care, he offered her an ice cream cone and relieved her of the bags, letting her enjoy the treat as they strolled side by side. Their striking resemblance left no doubt about their relationship. Though the daughter appeared to be Vivian's age, her father's eyes still saw the little girl needing protection.

The contrast stung.

Vivian abruptly ended the call, cutting off Richard mid-sentence. She stared at her darkened phone screen, the reflection showing eyes shimmering with unshed tears. The cab turned onto the highway, carrying her away from the gilded cage and toward an uncertain future. Somewhere in the city, Adrian was probably relieved by her absence. And Richard? He'd already moved on to plotting his next scheme.

The city skyline blurred as the cab accelerated. Vivian squared her shoulders. This time, she wouldn't look back.
###Chapter 69

The tender scene outside the car window stood in stark contrast to Richard Dawson's complete lack of paternal warmth. Vivian Hartley averted her gaze, her expression carefully blank.

On the phone, Richard's tone shifted slightly, the edge of mockery softening though the calculating undertone remained. "Natasha mentioned you and Adrian had a rather public disagreement about the divorce. Is this because of his ex?"

He paused briefly before continuing, more to himself than to her. "You know, I've been thinking... Marrying into wealth isn't all it's cracked up to be. Blood is thicker than water, after all. We're your real family. You must be getting a decent settlement, right? Speaking of which, Natasha has her eye on a Porsche 911. It's not unreasonable. If you bought it for her, she'd be very appreciative."

Vivian's jaw tightened, a bitter taste flooding her mouth. She'd expected this call to be unpleasant, but not this brazen. Her family's greed knew no limits - already counting money they assumed she'd get from the divorce. Richard's fake concern, wrapped in the pretense of family loyalty, was nothing but manipulation. Disgusting. Hypocritical.

For a moment, she questioned whether she truly shared DNA with this man. Sunlight streamed through the car window, warm and golden, yet an icy chill spread through her veins. Her thoughts drifted to Adrian, and an unbidden memory surfaced - him standing between her and her family's constant demands, shielding her from their relentless greed. Once, she'd seen him as her sanctuary after her mother's death. Now even that had turned to dust.

Vivian took a deep breath, locking away the surge of emotion. When she spoke, her voice was as sharp and cold as shattered glass. "Yes, Adrian and I are divorcing. And I'm leaving with nothing. So don't waste your time on me."

Richard's voice immediately rose in pitch. "What? Nothing? Have you lost your mind? Two years of marriage and you walk away empty-handed? Do you think I'll let him get away with this? I'll go to the Blackwoods myself and demand what's rightfully yours!"

A sharp pain lanced through Vivian's temples as she cut him off. "Do you honestly believe Adrian would overlook your motives? Go ahead, chase your money. But when Adrian retaliates, don't come crying to me. Remember what happened to the Seymours?"

The mention of the Seymour family effectively silenced Richard. The Seymours and Dawsons had been acquaintances, having once collaborated with the powerful Blackwood Group through their connection to the Dawson family. But when the Seymours tried to extort more money from Adrian, they found themselves bankrupt and exiled from Crestwood overnight - a brutal demonstration of Adrian's reach and ruthlessness.

Before Richard could respond, Vivian ended the call, immediately blocking his number. The moment she did, her phone rang again with an unknown number. Warily, she answered, "Hello?"

The voice on the other end was smooth and cultured. "Ms. Hartley? Damien Vaughn, CEO of Ivory Phoenix Productions. I understand you have someone in mind for our leading lady. Would you be available to meet with us and your candidate? What time works for you?"

Damien's direct yet sincere approach cut through Vivian's swirling thoughts. She pushed aside her emotional turmoil and responded with renewed purpose, "I'm available now."

With neither family nor love to anchor her, Vivian understood one thing clearly - life would go on.
###Chapter 70

The steady rhythm of work became Vivian's sanctuary, a fortress built with the bricks of financial independence. Never again would she chain herself to someone else's promises for security.

Damien's response came without pretense. "Perfect. I'll be waiting."

The navigation led Vivian to Hazelnut Time Coffee Shop, a hidden gem that whispered of old-world charm. Stone pathways wound through a courtyard where a wooden bridge arched over a babbling brook, flanked by corridors that seemed to hold centuries of secrets. Inside, the walls displayed museum-worthy paintings while delicate porcelain figurines watched from their shelves.

A waiter materialized with a bow. "This way, please."

She followed him to the Azure Room, where misty blue walls created an atmosphere of serene sophistication. With each step, Damien's voice replayed in her mind, painting him as someone who appreciated both beauty and substance.

The private rooms stood like islands of privacy, separated only by strands of antique crystal beads. Parting the strands, Vivian froze mid-step. A silver-haired man in a fitted black tee and artfully ripped designer jeans was pouring coffee with theatrical precision. His modern edge clashed deliciously with the room's classical decor.

The clinking beads made him look up. "Ms. Hartley?"

Vivian recovered swiftly, stepping through with practiced grace. "Mr. Vaughn."

"Damien, please." His smile revealed perfect teeth.

He dismissed the waiter with a glance and pulled out her chair. "No entourage today?"

As he filled her cup, his gaze lingered. "You outshine every actress in Hollywood. Just your face could sell this film."

"I'm auditioning for the lead," Vivian said, accepting the coffee. Chandelier light caught in her eyes like trapped stardust.

Damien's fingers stilled on the table. Realization dawned. The creator would know her character best. And with those cheekbones... fate had dealt her a winning hand.

"With training, you'd be unstoppable." His tone shifted. "But acting requires sacrifice. I assume you want your heroine done justice?"

Businessman first, dreamer second - Damien Vaughn didn't gamble with investments. A mediocre performance could sink everything.

Vivian's smile held decades of longing. "I trained at Kingsley Studios before... life intervened."

Kingsley - the Ivy League of acting schools, whose alumni glittered with awards. Damien's posture relaxed visibly.

The coffee steamed between them, swirling with possibilities.
###Chapter 71

Adrian stopped his absent-minded finger tapping on the table. With sudden enthusiasm, he grabbed the coffee pot and refilled Vivian's cup. "I'll contact the lead actor and arrange a meeting between you two to—" His words were abruptly cut off by a melodious voice floating through the doorway.

"Adrian, this place is so close to your office and absolutely charming. I think I'll start bringing lunch here so we can eat together during your breaks."

Though not loud, the voice cut through the quiet café like a knife. Vivian's heart skipped a beat. Could fate really be this cruel? She lifted her gaze through the beaded curtain and immediately locked eyes with Adrian's piercing, ice-cold stare.

"Adrian—" Serena, noticing his sudden stillness, followed his gaze and gasped. "Ms. Hartley?!"

Reacting instinctively, Vivian raised her hand but fumbled, sending the coffee pot crashing to the floor. Scalding liquid splashed across her skin, leaving an angry red mark.

Damien, oblivious to the newcomers at the entrance, immediately turned his attention to Vivian. He grabbed a nearby napkin and gently dabbed at her burned hand. "I'm so sorry! Are you hurt? That looks painful."

"What are you doing here, Vivian?" Adrian's voice was sharp with disapproval as he stepped forward. "If you're sick, you should be resting at home. Not out here... especially not with another man." His gaze darkened. "You're a married woman. You should maintain proper boundaries."

With one swift motion, Adrian pushed past the beaded curtain and inserted himself between them, pulling Vivian's hand away from Damien's gentle touch. His expression was thunderous as he sized up the unfamiliar man with silent accusation. Had he not intervened, Damien might have crossed an unacceptable line.

Adrian, whose business dealings never intersected with the entertainment industry, didn't recognize the famous producer. Likewise, Damien failed to place the media-shy billionaire.

Damien opened his mouth to explain, "We were just—"

Vivian yanked her arm free from Adrian's grasp, eyes flashing. "Watch your tone. This is my business associate, and we're here strictly for professional reasons."

Her pointed glance at Serena, who had followed Adrian inside, carried unspoken accusation. "Unlike you two." Though she aimed for sarcasm, Vivian couldn't quite mask the bitter edge in her voice. She'd been trying so hard to avoid Adrian, yet somehow they kept colliding in the same spaces. It felt like the universe was mocking her efforts.

No wonder Adrian and Serena were social media darlings. Unlike her strained interactions with Adrian, Serena seemed to complement him perfectly, moving in sync like an actual married couple. The thought twisted like a knife in Vivian's chest as she recalled her own crumbling marriage over the past two years.

Adrian bristled at Vivian's barb, his pride stung in front of another man. "So this is how you prove your independence? By clinging to other men?" His voice turned cutting. "If you needed help, you should have come to me."

Vivian responded with a cold, mocking smile. "Ask you for help? And watch you help someone else steal my role? Never." Though Adrian knew he was in the wrong, his stubborn pride won out. "What's so special about acting? You take your privileged life for granted. Do you really think success comes that easily?"

Serena, who had been silently observing their exchange, struggled to maintain her pleasant smile. She'd noticed how Adrian's gaze had lingered on Vivian since entering the café. While Adrian remained indifferent to her own interactions with other men, seeing Vivian with someone else clearly unsettled him. This realization sent a sharp pang through Serena's chest.

Stepping between them with practiced grace, Serena interjected in her signature sweet tone, "Ms. Hartley, there seems to be a misunderstanding. I invited a musician to discuss the theme song for our upcoming show. We happened to be near Adrian's office, and he joined out of concern." Her voice carried the effortless confidence of someone accustomed to being favored.
###Chapter 72

Vivian remained utterly composed despite the scrutiny, deliberately turning her attention to the delicate teacup before her. She took a slow, deliberate sip before dismissing the situation with a single cutting word. "Pathetic."

Serena, unfazed by Vivian's icy demeanor, suddenly pretended to notice another presence in the room. Her eyes widened with theatrical surprise. "Why, if it isn't Mr. Vaughn from Ivory Phoenix Productions!"

Damien's platinum blonde hair gleamed conspicuously in the confined space. Seizing the opportunity, Serena continued with calculated praise. "Mr. Vaughn, your legendary influence at Ivory Phoenix is unparalleled. Every script you touch turns to gold. It's extraordinary how you personally mentor certain actresses..." Her gaze slid meaningfully toward Vivian. "Ms. Hartley, you must realize how privileged you are to possess such... remarkable assets."

A dramatic pause. Then Serena sighed theatrically. "Though I suppose beauty does have its advantages." She hadn't anticipated Vivian's connection to Damien. The thought burned - how effortlessly Vivian obtained everything Serena fought for, all because of her perfect features.

Vivian caught the barb instantly. Her lips curved into a razor-sharp smile. "Ms. Whitmore, I'm astonished someone of your... limited appeal would understand beauty's privileges so intimately." She tilted her head slightly. "But then again, don't people always covet what they can never possess?"

Damien nearly choked on his drink, hastily disguising his laughter as a cough. Everyone turned to look as he struggled to maintain composure. Internally, he was applauding Vivian's verbal precision - she'd eviscerated Serena without a single crude word.

No wonder she was considered the industry's top screenwriter. Given half a chance, Damien would gladly spend hours picking her brain about character dialogue.

Serena stood frozen, face flushing crimson before she turned tearful eyes toward Adrian. His expression darkened as he confronted Vivian. "What's wrong with you lately? Your tongue's grown sharper than a viper's fang."

"And you're just going to ignore her blatant insults?" Vivian's voice cracked with exhaustion. If only Adrian had been willing to communicate like an adult, they might not be standing at divorce's precipice.

Cutting herself off, Vivian snatched her purse from the chair with a weary sigh. "Mr. Vaughn, let's reschedule our business discussion. I'll contact you later."

As she moved to leave, Damien stood immediately. "Allow me to escort you." Vivian swept past Adrian without acknowledgment, her heels clicking decisively against the marble. Damien followed without sparing Adrian a glance, as if the other man were invisible.

Adrian stood rooted, a storm of conflicting emotions brewing beneath his carefully controlled expression. This casual dismissal from his own wife - in name only now - struck at his pride. Once, he'd basked in her undivided attention. Now, watching her walk away with another man, he found himself compulsively straightening his tie, seeking some small comfort.

Once the pair had disappeared, Serena ventured carefully, "Do you think Ms. Hartley's sudden push for divorce means she's found... alternative support?" Each word was measured, designed to gauge Adrian's reaction.
###Chapter 73

Vivian's fingers tightened around her coffee cup as Serena's voice softened unexpectedly. "I understand, really. When you're a wealthy housewife with no financial concerns, emotions can easily spiral out of control."

Adrian's jaw clenched as he rubbed his temples. "Supported by someone else? I've given her everything. Name one woman in Crestwood who lives better than she does."

Serena sighed, her tone laced with resignation. "But happiness is subjective, isn't it? Maybe Damien Vaughn offers her something... different. Perhaps she's finally pursuing what truly makes her happy."

Outside the Hazelnut Time Coffee Shop, Vivian turned to face Damien who had followed her out. A dull ache pulsed at her temples. She couldn't care less about Adrian's assumptions now - her priority was keeping Damien out of her personal affairs.

She was searching for a polite way to dismiss him when movement caught her eye. Across the street, Audrey stood in a curve-hugging red dress, waving enthusiastically.

"Darling! Congratulations on your newfound freedom!" Audrey called out with a mischievous grin.

Vivian froze momentarily, stunned by Audrey's sudden appearance from Frostholm. Turning back to Damien, she offered an apologetic smile. "I'm sorry, my friend just arrived unexpectedly. I should go."

"And about that audition - just text me the details. My schedule's wide open these days," Vivian added quickly, grabbing Audrey's arm and steering her away.

Inside the taxi, Vivian studied her old friend. "What brought you back?"

"Couldn't track down Sess overseas, so here I am," Audrey replied casually, stretching her legs. She leaned forward to instruct the driver, "Mirage Lounge, please."

Vivian's eyes narrowed. "How did you know where to find me?"

Audrey smirked, twirling a strand of hair around her finger. "Please, nothing happens in this industry without me knowing. Especially when Mr. Vaughn was meeting with Katrina Spencer right here."

Only Audrey knew Vivian used that pseudonym.

With a playful nudge, Audrey teased, "I'd only heard Damien Vaughn's name before. Had no idea he was that gorgeous. Why not give him a chance now that you're rid of that bastard Adrian?"

The memory of Adrian's cruel words still stung. "Don't even start," Vivian cut in sharply. "I'm focusing on my career right now."

"Fine, fine," Audrey conceded, her smile bright. "Tonight's about celebrating your freedom anyway."

They'd been inseparable since high school. Back then, Audrey was the quiet, struggling student while Vivian was the class representative who often covered for her missed assignments. Their friendship solidified when Audrey collapsed in class one day - Vivian carried her to the infirmary despite twisting her ankle, then stayed by her side for hours.

During their sophomore year, Audrey had rebelled against her father's plans to marry her off for business alliances. Claiming she needed to study abroad, she escaped to Frostholm for seven years before returning to build the life she wanted.
###Chapter 74

Vivian felt genuine sympathy for Audrey, though a pang of envy twisted in her chest at her friend's carefree independence. She secretly longed for the day when she too could embrace such unbridled freedom.

Their taxi came to a smooth halt outside the sleek entrance of Mirage Lounge. Vivian stepped out, her eyes tracing the modern neon sign glowing with understated elegance. The establishment radiated sophistication without crossing into vulgarity.

Yet the moment she stepped inside, the heavy scent of expensive liquor assaulted her senses. Strobe lights crisscrossed through the haze while bass-heavy music pulsed from private rooms. Everywhere she looked, men and women exchanged glances laden with unspoken promises.

This was foreign territory for Vivian. "Wouldn't we be more comfortable at a nice restaurant? What's so special about this place anyway?" she asked, shifting uncomfortably in her heels.

Audrey merely laughed, draping an arm around Vivian's shoulders as a hostess led them to a secluded VIP area. "The food here is divine, darling. But tonight, I'm introducing you to real adult entertainment," she purred, eyes sparkling with mischief.

Vivian barely had time to settle into the plush seating before a procession of strikingly handsome men entered. Each stood well over six feet with sculpted physiques that wouldn't look out of place on a fashion runway. Their presence made the spacious room feel suddenly intimate.

These must be the high-end escorts she'd heard about in gossip columns. Though Vivian had never frequented such establishments, the scene unfolding before her left no doubt about their purpose.

"Welcome, ladies," the men chorused in velvety tones that made Vivian's pulse jump.

Audrey remained utterly composed, clearly no stranger to such venues. She nudged Vivian sharply. "Check out the one by the far wall," she whispered with a wicked grin. "Doesn't he remind you of that bastard Adrian?"

Vivian's gaze flickered to the indicated man. In the mood lighting, his chiseled jawline and piercing eyes did bear a passing resemblance to Adrian's features. The comparison left a bitter taste in her mouth. "A slight resemblance," she admitted reluctantly.

With a casual flick of her wrist, Audrey summoned the young man over. "You'll be keeping my friend company tonight," she declared with absolute authority.

The Adrian lookalike approached smoothly, uncorking a bottle of champagne with practiced ease. "Would the lady prefer cards or dice?" he asked, settling beside Vivian with feline grace.

Vivian's body went rigid. Despite the luxurious seating, she sat as stiffly as a schoolgirl at chapel. Her physical reactions had always betrayed her emotions - she found the man's proximity unsettling rather than alluring. Though objectively handsome, his presence sparked no desire, only an instinctive recoil.

Audrey rolled her eyes at Vivian's discomfort. "Adrian's probably slept with that mistress of his a hundred times by now," she pointed out bluntly. "You're practically divorced - why cling to outdated morals?"

Recognizing her friend's discomfort, Audrey turned to the escorts. "No physical contact with my friend. Drinks and conversation only. Understood?"

Vivian's fingers tightened around her champagne flute. If Adrian could move on so easily, why shouldn't she? Decent men might be rare, but the world certainly wasn't lacking in male companionship. Why should she resign herself to loneliness after escaping the Blackwood family's gilded cage?
###Chapter 75

Vivian swallowed her hesitation along with the champagne, forcing herself to remain seated. Whether it was stubborn pride or not wanting to ruin Audrey's evening, she reached for the deck of cards with renewed determination.

The male escorts, sensing the change in atmosphere, moved closer as the game resumed. Audrey, more enthusiastic than skilled, quickly accumulated losses that left her surrounded by empty cocktail glasses. She swayed dangerously when standing. "I need air. Bathroom break," she mumbled.

Vivian stood to follow, but the crowd blocked her path. One wrong move would mean unwanted physical contact, so she reluctantly sat back down.

Meanwhile, in the dimly lit hallway, a group of sharply dressed businessmen approached the VIP section. Adrian moved at the center, his stormy expression betraying his fraying patience. Dominic walked beside him, casting concerned glances. "Adrian," he ventured carefully, "if you're this distracted, maybe we should call it a night. Go home and talk things through. Compromise isn't weakness when it's for someone you love. Unless... you're truly set on this divorce?"

Adrian's jaw clenched at the word. It had become a constant irritation, growing more painful with each passing hour. Vivian had been testing boundaries lately, flaunting her newfound independence in ways that left him seething yet powerless.

His icy glare silenced Dominic. "Unless you have something constructive to say, keep your opinions to yourself."

As they neared the private rooms, Audrey stumbled out of hers, phone in hand, oblivious to the approaching storm. The men in Adrian's group paused, their attention caught by the sight of male escorts lounging inside her room.

"Damn, these ladies know how to party harder than we do," one remarked. "An entire room of pretty boys? That's impressive."

Another chuckled, "She's stunning too. Makes you wonder if she's got any married friends inside being just as adventurous." The mention of married women inevitably turned their thoughts to Vivian.

Adrian had been conspicuously absent from home, leaving his wife to endure years of solitude. One particularly bold colleague, fueled by liquid courage, quipped, "Adrian, you've left your wife alone so long. Aren't you worried she might... find alternative companionship?"

The playful mood evaporated instantly. A heavy silence descended as all eyes darted nervously toward Adrian. He remained motionless, absently twisting his wedding ring.

The words "find alternative companionship" echoed painfully in his mind. Images of Vivian flashed before him - her quiet defiance earlier that day, the way she'd masked her pain when injured. She'd endured far worse without complaint, yet today she'd crumbled in another man's arms over a minor burn.

The irony cut deeper than any blade.

After an unbearable silence, Adrian finally spoke, his voice dangerously calm. "She wouldn't dare."

After hours of drinking that blurred the line between celebration and debauchery, Audrey suddenly flung the playing cards across the table as if personally offended by them.

"Disaster!" she gasped, panic edging her voice. "My brother knows I'm back! He's coming to drag me out! I have to run! Vivian, stay here - I'll arrange your ride home."
###Chapter 76

Vivian's thoughts were still tangled when Audrey grabbed her purse and vanished like a shadow slipping through the night.

Left alone in the dimly lit room, Vivian sank deeper into the plush chair. Her head spun violently, the world tilting like a ship caught in a tempest. The expensive champagne churned in her stomach as she found herself surrounded by unfamiliar male faces. The irritation she'd been suppressing all evening flared to life with fresh intensity.

One of the gigolos, emboldened by her solitude, swaggered toward her. He moved with the cocky assurance of a discount Adrian, all smoldering looks without the substance. Leaning far too close, his whiskey-laced breath ghosted across her ear. "Need a ride home, beautiful?"

The stench of alcohol made her recoil, but the liquor had stolen her strength, leaving her trapped in a hazy paralysis.

Mistaking her silence for consent, his fingers crept up her thigh with practiced ease. The velvet touch sent revulsion skittering down her spine.

This establishment catered to wealthy older women and clients with particular tastes. A young, stunning woman like Vivian was an unexpected prize. The man clearly saw her as his golden ticket to better prospects.

His touch sliced through her drunken fog like a blade. With a violent jerk, she shoved him away. Stumbling to her feet, her elbow sent crystal glasses shattering across the marble floor.

The room plunged into stunned silence. The rowdy atmosphere evaporated as the men froze like children caught mid-mischief. Fighting nausea, Vivian's voice cut through the tension like ice. "Leave. Now."

Most scattered like frightened rabbits, but the Adrian-wannabe lingered. A nervous grin twisted his lips as he raised a champagne flute in mock toast. "Come on, sweetheart, I was just—"

"Get out!" Vivian's shout echoed off the walls. She pointed to the door with trembling fury. "Unless you want security dragging you out."

At that exact moment, the private room across the hall swung open. Dominic emerged, his tailored jacket slung carelessly over one shoulder. His eyebrows shot up at the scene—Vivian standing amidst broken glass, her chest heaving with anger, hair tumbling from its elegant updo. Even furious, she radiated undeniable magnetism.

Dominic's lips quirked as he turned to Adrian. "Isn't that your—"

The words died in his throat at Adrian's thunderous expression. A suffocating silence descended. The remaining onlookers wished they could melt into the walls, suddenly terrified of witnessing the infamous Blackwood temper firsthand.

Dominic clapped sharply, his voice cutting through the tension. "Show's over, gentlemen. Time to disappear unless you enjoy unemployment." It was both command and mercy.

They scattered like leaves before a storm, leaving the hallway eerily empty within seconds.
###Chapter 77

Adrian didn't hesitate. He flung open the door to Vivian's VIP suite with a force that mirrored his barely contained rage. "Vivian Hartley! Explain yourself!"

The scene before him was drastically different from the fiery confrontation moments earlier. Vivian's earlier defiance had dissolved into drunken lethargy, her body swaying as she attempted to reach the velvet chaise. The sudden intrusion made her blink blearily at the imposing figure now filling the doorway.

Even through her alcohol-hazed vision, his aristocratic features were unmistakable. That chiseled jawline, those piercing eyes - the resemblance to Adrian was so striking Vivian let out a tipsy giggle.

Stumbling forward, her legs betrayed her and she tumbled directly into his chest. For some inexplicable reason, she made no move to pull away. Instead, her fingers playfully patted his cheek. "Well hello there, handsome. Did Mirage Lounge save their best imitation for last? You're much better quality than those other boys."

Her voice dripped with intoxicated flirtation as she snuggled deeper into his embrace, perfectly content to remain there.

Adrian's grip tightened as his mind replayed the parade of male entertainers exiting the room. His temper flared. Did being drunk excuse this shameless behavior? His imagination ran wild with possibilities of what might have occurred before his arrival.

Swallowing his fury, he decided this wasn't the place for confrontation. Wordlessly, he scooped her into his arms - her slight frame barely registering as he carried her out. Vivian responded by looping her arms around his neck with a dreamy smile, their pose deceptively romantic to any onlookers.

At the threshold, Adrian shot Dominic a pointed look. "Scrub all surveillance footage," he commanded, his tone leaving no room for argument.

Dominic observed the scene with raised eyebrows, stroking his chin thoughtfully as he watched the pair disappear down the corridor.

Outside Mirage Lounge, Ethan stood waiting by the town car, holding the door open with practiced efficiency. Adrain's voice was laced with venom. "Business mogul by day, party girl by night. Impressive multitasking, Vivian. That demure wife act fooled me completely." He unceremoniously dumped her into the backseat before sliding in beside her.

Ethan, remembering their last explosive car ride, immediately raised the privacy partition. Vivian whimpered at the rough handling, her delicate features scrunching in discomfort. She tried to sit up properly but only succeeded in collapsing against Adrian's solid frame.

Seizing the opportunity, she gazed up at him with glassy eyes. "Don't look at me like that! I didn't do anything wrong! Those boys didn't even touch me!" Adrian's jaw clenched. "And that disappoints you?" Skeptical, he roughly tilted her chin, inspecting every inch of her neck and behind her ears for telltale marks. Her porcelain skin showed no evidence of contact beyond the flush of alcohol.

"Ow!" she protested, breaking free from his grip with surprising strength for someone so intoxicated. Then, with drunken boldness, she reached up to trace his jawline. "I wasn't interested earlier... but now that I see you properly..." Her fingers trailed down his throat. "I want much more than just holding hands."
###Chapter 78

The vibration of his phone shattered the tense silence between them.

The sudden chime cut through the moment like a knife. Adrian swiped open the screen to reveal surveillance footage from the private lounge where Vivian had been. One hand trapped her restless fingers while the other tapped the video.

Vivian exhaled dramatically, slouching back with an exaggerated pout. "Work again? When do you ever relax? You and Dominic are cut from the same stone - cold and unreadable. What woman would want that?"

As the footage played, Adrian's initial fury subsided though his expression remained stormy. The video showed nothing alarming - just guests drinking and playing games. Then, near the end, a man bearing slight resemblance to Adrian appeared, sitting too close to Vivian. The so-called "escort" had dared to place a hand on her thigh.

Adrian froze the frame, screenshot it, and sent it to Dominic. Before he could type instructions, Dominic's immediate reply popped up: "Already handled, Adrian. That hand won't trouble anyone again. He's been permanently banned from Crestwood."

Meanwhile, Vivian, still teetering between tipsy and drunk, squinted at him. "That damn phone... Is the Blackwood Group really that demanding? Or are you just too preoccupied with her?"

Her voice cracked despite the sarcastic tone.

Adrian loosened his collar as if the fabric choked him. "Look at yourself," he said sharply. "You're making a scene. You're embarrassing the Blackwood name."

"Set foot in places like this again, and I'll ensure you can't walk there myself." His words were meant to sting, but Vivian, far from intimidated, fired back with drunken candor.

"Embarrassing the Blackwoods?" she scoffed bitterly. "Who even knows I'm part of this family? The world thinks she's your wife. To everyone else, I'm just your dirty little secret. The Blackwoods may be filthy rich, but what did I get? No wedding, no recognition. People probably think I'm your mistress!"

An unfamiliar pang struck Adrian's chest - sympathy perhaps - but it vanished when Vivian spat, "Adrian the Asshole."

His expression hardened. "You claimed the wedding didn't matter, yet now you throw it in my face. Seems you're the hypocrite here."

Vivian frowned, considering this before shaking her head. "Hypocrite? Hardly. I own my choices. But I do regret handing over those twenty million. He squandered it all on his precious darling's designer wardrobe!"

Adrian scoffed. "Your pocket change would be worthless to me even at my lowest."

"Broke, are you?" Vivian shrugged. "Join the club. You're quite the catch, but I'm bankrupt. Can't afford your price tag, so maybe you should leave." She reached for the car door.

In one swift motion, Adrian hauled her back. "Trying to jump out again? Didn't learn your lesson last time?"

For a moment, Vivian stayed silent in his grip. Adrian thought he'd intimidated her - but how rational could a drunk person be?
###Chapter 79

Vivian curled against him like a contented kitten, her sultry gaze half-lidded with playful seduction. "You initiated this embrace, darling. So really, I'm just accepting your generous invitation."

Her fingertips danced along the column of his throat as she tilted her chin upward. When her lips brushed his Adam's apple, she traced its contour with the tip of her tongue. "Mmm...you smell divine," she purred.

Adrian's throat worked visibly as heat pooled low in his abdomen, his body responding with unmistakable enthusiasm.

The hard ridge pressing against her hip made Vivian squirm in mock protest. "Good heavens, that's...impressive," she slurred with drunken amusement, her voice dripping with honeyed mischief. "But perhaps a bit too impressive for comfort."

"Vivian," Adrian growled in warning, his voice rough with restraint.

Undeterred, she hooked a finger beneath his chin, her eyes sparkling with liquid mischief. "Why so serious? Afraid you can't handle me? Or..." Her lips curved in a wicked smile. "Is the mighty Adrian Blackwood all bark and no bite?"

Something primal snapped in Adrian's gaze.

His hand slid beneath her blouse, fingers skimming up the delicate curve of her waist before claiming the soft swell of her breast in a possessive grip.

"Ah—" The breathy sigh escaped her parted lips before she could stop it, her body arching instinctively into his touch.

He cradled her face, his mouth descending toward hers with predatory intent.

Then the world tilted violently.

A tidal wave of nausea surged up Vivian's throat. With a strangled "urk," she barely managed to turn her head before the contents of her stomach erupted in an undignified torrent.

Adrian recoiled, but not quickly enough to avoid collateral damage.

The luxurious car interior filled with the pungent stench of alcohol and half-digested canapés.

Mortified, Vivian wiped her mouth with the back of her hand before curling into a miserable ball in the cleanest corner of the seat, promptly passing out.

Adrian studied her sleeping form, his expression darkening with unspoken questions. Was this simple drunkenness? Or did her body reject him on some fundamental level? Even inebriated, was she confusing him with someone else while her subconscious rebelled? This marked the second time she'd ruined an intimate moment with gastrointestinal rebellion.

Morning light stabbed through Vivian's eyelids like tiny daggers. The pounding in her skull rivaled a construction crew at full tilt. Worse still, she discovered herself draped over Adrian like some sort of human octopus.

Last night's humiliation came rushing back. She squeezed her eyes shut tighter, wishing the plush mattress would swallow her whole.

"Enough pretending." Adrian's voice cut through her misery like an arctic wind. "If you're conscious, get off me."

Without ceremony, he disentangled himself from her clinging limbs, leaving Vivian to face her shame alone.

Reluctantly, she peeled her eyes open to find Adrian sitting up, the morning light sculpting his bare torso into a landscape of taut muscle and golden skin.
###Chapter 80

Adrian's physique was undeniably flawless, the one thing Vivian couldn't find fault with even if she tried.

A mocking smirk played on Adrian's lips as he caught her staring. "Enjoying the show?"

Vivian's cheeks flushed crimson, but she refused to back down. "Well, you're the one standing there half-naked. What else am I supposed to look at?"

He turned away with deliberate casualness, reaching for his discarded shirt.

His voice carried both amusement and something darker as he mused, "Sometimes I wonder if this divorce talk is just your twisted way of getting my attention."

"Don't flatter yourself," Vivian snapped, turning her face toward the window. "You're the last person I'd want attention from."

Adrian's expression remained unreadable as he buttoned his shirt. "Really? Then who was it who couldn't keep her hands off me in the car? Who clung to me like a limpet all night?"

"I was intoxicated," Vivian began, then realized her mistake too late.

She straightened her spine, forcing a cold smile. "If I were truly trying to seduce you, do you think I'd have ended up vomiting? My body clearly rejected you on instinct."

The words confirmed Adrian's earlier suspicions, yet something in him rebelled against accepting them. "You always have an angle," he muttered darkly.

Vivian exhaled sharply. "Why complicate things? Just sign the damn papers and we're done."

Adrian finished dressing, giving her a skeptical once-over. "You think marriage is some childish game? That you can walk away whenever you please and come crawling back later?"

A bitter laugh escaped Vivian's lips. "Your ego is truly staggering. When have I ever indicated I want reconciliation? We can put it in writing - a clause forbidding any future remarriage if that eases your fragile male pride."

"This is pointless," Adrian declared, striding toward the door. "I have actual responsibilities to attend to."

Left alone, Vivian sank back into the pillows, fragments of last night resurfacing.

She'd been violently ill all over Adrian. Given his notorious self-absorption, why hadn't he simply left her to deal with the aftermath alone?

Yet somehow they'd ended up sharing a bed.

Had he actually... taken care of her?

The door swung open again moments later.

This time it was Gwendolyn, the imperious housekeeper Adrian had recently hired, who swept in with an air of ownership, muttering about endless chores.

Spotting Vivian awake, the woman didn't bother hiding her disdain. "I was the one who changed your soiled clothes and put you to bed in the guest room last night."
###Chapter 81

The morning light filtered through the curtains, casting a golden glow over the master bedroom. Vivian Hartley stirred, her head throbbing from last night's excesses. She had no memory of how she'd ended up back in this room.

She sat up abruptly, the silk sheets slipping from her shoulders. Gwendolyn Pierce stood at the foot of the bed, arms crossed, lips curled in disdain.

"This is my bedroom," Vivian snapped, swinging her legs over the edge of the bed. "Why shouldn't I be here?"

Gwendolyn's smirk deepened. "Because Mr. Blackwood was very clear last night. He brought you home, handed you over to me, and insisted I clean you up and put you in the guest room. He didn’t want you soiling his space." She tilted her head, mocking. "I made sure you were asleep before I left. Imagine my surprise when I found you here this morning. Keeping track of you is exhausting."

Vivian froze, the words like a blade twisting in her chest.

Once again, she’d been a fool. Even with the truth staring her in the face, she’d let herself imagine Adrian Blackwood caring for her through the night.

But why would he? When she’d been feverish before, he hadn’t lifted a finger. Why would a drunken stupor change that?

She swallowed the bitter ache, forcing herself to see this as a lesson. A necessary one. It kept things clean. No complications. No awkward encounters today.

Maybe, in time, the last embers of hope would die out completely.

Once Gwendolyn left, Vivian dragged herself into the shower, dressed quickly, and gathered her things.

Outside, she checked her phone—dozens of missed calls from Audrey Winslow.

Just as she was about to call back, Audrey’s name flashed on the screen again.

"Vivian! Are you alive?" Audrey’s voice was frantic. "Last night, when the driver went to pick you up at Mirage Lounge, they said you’d left with someone else! I’ve been calling everyone, but no one would tell me who! If you hadn’t answered today, I was filing a missing person report!"

Vivian’s throat tightened at her friend’s concern. She bit back the humiliation and forced a light tone. "I ran into Adrian last night. Thought he was just another pretty face for hire. He took me back to Seabreeze Villa."

Audrey’s tension melted into curiosity. "You thought Adrian Blackwood was a gigolo? Did anything... happen?"

Vivian’s pulse jumped. "No. Nothing happened. How could it? I threw up in his car, and he dumped me here before leaving."

But the memory of that almost-kiss burned in her mind.

Did something that almost happened even count?

Audrey, oblivious to the shift in Vivian’s voice, brightened. "Let’s go shopping and grab lunch today. No bars, just us. Emerald Pizzeria? My treat."

Vivian agreed absently. "Fine. See you there."

She didn’t notice Gwendolyn watching from the shadows.

Not yet.

###Chapter 82

As Vivian left, Gwendolyn remained by the window, picking up the phone with practiced deference. "Everything went exactly as planned. She seemed quite shaken. Didn't even think to verify with Mr. Blackwood before rushing off to Emerald Pizzeria, according to her phone conversation."

The Opal Galleria buzzed with midday energy as Audrey and Vivian emerged from a confectionery shop, arms linked and laughter bright.

Audrey's attention suddenly caught on a luxury boutique's display window. Her fingers tightened around Vivian's arm. "That dress! It's made for you!" She pointed at an ivory creation with intricate lace detailing and daring side cutouts. "Let me get it for you - consider it a belated birthday gift!"

Vivian shook her head, fingers brushing the price tag. "It's too much, really. Besides, where would I even wear something like this?"

"Nonsense!" Audrey tugged her toward the entrance. "Trying costs nothing. And look -" She gestured to her own designer bag. "We've got the credentials to warrant their attention."

The sales associate perked up immediately at Audrey's confident approach. "The VIP fitting room is occupied, but you may use this one here," she offered, already unhooking the gown.

Audrey settled onto a velvet chaise lounge, idly scanning the nearly empty store. Her gaze snagged on a man's silhouette partially visible behind a decorative screen. Even in profile, his aristocratic bearing was unmistakable - the kind of man who belonged in tailored suits and boardrooms rather than waiting outside dressing rooms.

She smirked to herself. Probably some wealthy husband enduring his wife's shopping spree.

The fitting room curtain swished open.

Audrey's breath caught. The dress transformed Vivian - the delicate fabric clinging to her curves, the strategic cutouts drawing attention to her slender waist. "My God, Viv, you look-"

"Adrian, what do you think of this one?" A honeyed voice interrupted as Serena Whitmore emerged from the adjacent fitting room wearing the identical gown.

The screen shifted. Adrian Blackwood rose to his full height, his gaze locking onto Vivian.

Audrey nearly choked on her tongue. So much for the devoted husband theory. Those Mirage Lounge cocktails must have addled her brain to mistake Adrian Blackwood for anyone's doting spouse.

The air thickened as Adrian's dark eyes traveled the length of Vivian's body. The dress hugged every curve, the high slit revealing toned legs that seemed to go on forever.

Vivian stood frozen, the color draining from her face as recognition dawned. The boutique's lights caught the subtle tremble of her fingers where they gripped the delicate fabric.

Serena's painted lips curved into something sharp. "Well, isn't this... interesting."
###Chapter 83

The crimson scar stood out starkly against Vivian's otherwise flawless skin.

Adrian's mind wandered to his grandmother's famous healing balm, remembering how it had miraculously faded his cousin Bianca's deep laceration from a skiing accident within weeks.

Yet Vivian's scar remained vivid, a cruel reminder of the injury's severity.

Noticing Adrian's gaze, Vivian instinctively shifted behind a chair, using it as a shield for her leg.

That scar always made her feel inadequate, especially around him. She wished she could vanish.

She feared nothing more than Adrian seeing her imperfections - both the visible ones and those hidden in her past.

As Adrian moved toward her, Serena tugged at his sleeve with honeyed sweetness. "Adrian?"

He turned with a questioning look. "Yes?"

Serena did a playful spin in her dress, eyes bright with expectation. "How do I look?"

Though shorter than Vivian, the dress skimmed Serena's knees, clinging to her petite frame without accentuating her curves, projecting innocence rather than sensuality.

"You look lovely," Adrian assured, making her face light up.

With a triumphant smile, Serena approached Vivian. "Ms. Hartley, what a surprise seeing you here! I spilled coffee earlier and Adrian insisted on buying me something new. Hope you don't mind!"

She stood beside Vivian, youthful yet provocative. "So Adrian, who wears it better - me or Ms. Hartley?"

Adrian hesitated, then remembered how that man had caressed Vivian's leg last night. Had she been wearing this dress, his hands would have touched bare skin.

Irritation flared. "You wear it far better than she ever could."

Vivian had no interest in this petty competition. She turned toward the fitting room to change.

Adrian noted her indifference, realizing he'd been too soft. His voice turned sharp. "What even is this dress? It barely covers anything. Can't you choose something decent?"

Vivian froze as her old scar throbbed. From Adrian's focus on her legs, she inferred he found her scars repulsive, needing concealment.

Even as his lawful wife, his words suggested she embarrassed the Blackwood name. He could've feigned courtesy for appearances. Why publicly display such disgust?

Seeing Vivian's reaction, Audrey assumed intimidation and stepped forward protectively. "Mr. Blackwood, can't you distinguish genuine elegance from cheap imitation? Or do you truly prefer the artificial over natural beauty? Do you honestly think her childish frame compares to Vivian's grace?"
###Chapter 84

Serena's voice was honeyed as she intervened, "Darling, he was only joking. No need to get so defensive."

My fragile heart condition meant Adrian always treated me with kid gloves.

I know I lack Vivian Hartley's commanding presence.

"Honestly, at her age, she should opt for more sophisticated choices."

Adrian immediately assumed Audrey was the corrupting influence behind Vivian's recent rebellious streak. The way Audrey dressed - all plunging necklines and thigh-high slits - explained everything about Vivian's sudden attitude shift.

Deliberately ignoring Audrey, Adrian focused his disapproval on Vivian. "With friends like these, no wonder you're acting like some wild club girl now."

Vivian had endured their subtle digs before, but dragging Audrey into this crossed a line. Her laughter was sharp as broken glass. "Oh, this is rich! The cheating husband and his homewrecking mistress giving lectures on propriety? Maybe you should check your own reflection first. Tell me, who exactly needs moral guidance here? The woman standing her ground or the two-timing hypocrites?"

"Vivian!" Adrian's voice cracked like thunder through the boutique.

Serena immediately fluttered between them, her voice trembling. "Adrian, please, this is my fault. Let's not fight over something so trivial."

Vivian's gaze drifted toward the exit, desperate to escape their suffocating presence.

Audrey nearly applauded Vivian's verbal takedown but settled for sliding her black card across the counter. "We'll take the dress."

But Vivian shook her head, throwing one last scathing look at Adrian. "Actually, no. I just realized - how embarrassing to choose the same tasteless gown as Miss Whitmore. Some mistakes shouldn't be repeated."

The unspoken comparison to her disastrous marriage hung heavy in the air.

Audrey smirked, adding fuel to the fire. "You're absolutely right. Those white floral accents? So... manufactured innocence. Perfect for certain types, I suppose."

Adrian's jaw tightened, ready to retaliate against their barbed comments.

"Save your breath," Vivian cut in, her voice steely. "Your opinions stopped mattering to me the moment you broke your vows. Say what you want - I know exactly where I stand."

With that, she turned sharply and marched back to the dressing room.

Watching Adrian get verbally eviscerated, Serena felt her fear of Vivian's wrath dissipate. The more Vivian asserted herself, the quicker Adrian's patience would wear thin.

When Vivian emerged in her original outfit and motioned for Audrey to leave, Serena put on her most concerned expression. "Adrian, I'm so sorry for causing trouble between you two today. Don't worry about me - you should go after her. Strong women still need tenderness sometimes. A little extra attention might smooth things over."
###Chapter 85

Adrian turned his back, his face an unreadable mask of indifference. "She's none of your concern," he replied, his voice like winter frost, devoid of any warmth.

Serena's question trembled in the air. "Adrian... is it true? Are you really considering divorce?"

"Divorce?" Adrian scoffed, casually producing a platinum credit card from his wallet and sliding it across the counter. "Package the dress she's wearing and those purses she liked." His deflection was smooth as silk.

The total soared past a million sterling.

The salesgirl's eyes widened momentarily before she caught herself. "Right away, Mr. Blackwood." She scurried off to process the extravagant purchase.

From the moment Adrian and Serena had entered, the boutique staff had received strict instructions from management - absolute discretion regarding their VIP clients. No gossip, no photos, no exceptions.

Initially indifferent, the salesgirl now practically glowed with commission-fueled enthusiasm. "Miss Whitmore, that gown was made for you! Might we take a commemorative photo?" Her smile stretched unnaturally wide.

"Of course," Serena answered, her lips curving into a practiced smile that never reached her eyes, her fingers curling into tight fists at her sides.

Outside the boutique, Vivian had just stepped onto the sidewalk when the scene inside caught her attention. She whirled around, ready to charge back in, when Audrey grabbed her wrist.

"Why are you stopping me?" Vivian hissed, her emerald eyes blazing. "That conniving snake needs to be exposed! Did you see how she's playing the victim?"

Audrey pulled her away from the storefront. "We already put her in her place earlier. This is exactly what she wants - to make you look like the jealous ex while she plays damsel in distress for Adrian. Don't give her the satisfaction."

Vivian allowed herself to be led away, linking arms with Audrey as she vented. "What spell has that woman cast over Adrian? How can he not see through her act? She's about as subtle as a neon sign in a library! And that outfit? Looks like she raided a discount bin at PrimeCart."

Audrey listened quietly, her own resolve crystallizing. "Men are unreliable. I'll build my own empire. Whatever that viper has schemed her way into, I'll earn tenfold through my own talent!"

Her phone buzzed with a text from Damien Vaughn confirming her audition time with the male lead.

Three days later at Ivory Phoenix Productions, Lydia burst into the waiting area, her chest heaving. Spotting Vivian lounging on a plush sofa, she exhaled in relief. "You drop this bombshell at the last possible moment! Thank goodness my schedule was clear."

Vivian offered a reassuring smile. "It's just an audition. No guarantees."

"For a project this prestigious? Just getting in the door is half the battle!" Lydia collapsed beside her. "How did you land this? The Katrina Spencer screenplay? Even our agency's top talent would kill for this opportunity. Was it that contact who helped you during the scandal?"

Vivian took a deep breath, steeling herself. "Lydia... I am Katrina Spencer."
###Chapter 86

Lydia, as her manager, had to find out sooner or later.

With an exasperated sigh, Lydia gave her a skeptical look. "Right, and I suppose you're also secretly royalty?"

Vivian hesitated for a split second. Technically, she was Vivian Hartley. Determined to settle this, she pulled up the copyright agreement on her phone and shoved it toward Lydia. "See for yourself."

Lydia took the device with obvious doubt, but her eyes widened as she scanned the document.

She looked up, stunned. "You're actually Vivian Hartley?"

Vivian nodded firmly. "Yes."

"Why keep it a secret? And why bother auditioning for Blazing Horizon like some newcomer?" Lydia's composure cracked completely.

Vivian had every advantage, yet she'd let Serena humiliate her?

Vivian remembered storming out of the house that day with no plan, just raw determination—and somehow, that had led her straight to Lydia.

She exhaled. "At first, I needed to prove I could make it on my own merit. No shortcuts."

Lydia rubbed her temples. "Well, it's not too late to pivot."

A sudden thought made Lydia rummage through her bag. She produced a cream-colored envelope. "This came for you."

Vivian took it, frowning. "Who sent it?"

"No clue. It was left at reception with strict orders to hand it directly to you. The courier vanished before I could ask questions." Lydia's frown deepened, as if mentally retracing steps that led nowhere.

Vivian slid a finger under the flap. Inside lay an ivory card, its surface embossed with a single elegant word: Invitation. The kind that reeked of obligation masked as privilege.

Her phone buzzed before she could open it. Damien Vaughn's name flashed on the screen, his impatient voice crackling through. "Where are you? We're waiting."

"On my way," she muttered, tucking the envelope away—then tossing it into the nearest bin without a second glance. These things found her like clockwork every year, each more tedious than the last.

She didn't bother wondering how they'd tracked her to the office. In this world, privacy was a myth.

Truth was, she loathed these events. Adrian, her husband, treated invitations like hot potatoes, dumping them on her with a dismissive, "Go if you want."

But what was the point? She could script the night's trajectory blindfolded: either endure pitying whispers about her absent husband, or fend off men who saw a lone woman as an open invitation.

Snapping back to the present, Vivian glanced at Lydia. "Let's go. Damien and Sebastian Hartwell are waiting."

Sebastian Hartwell wasn't just another pretty face.

###Chapter 87

A true triple threat, Sebastian Hartwell had built an empire as a global superstar who dominated music charts, dance floors, and box offices alike. Any project bearing his and Vivian Hartley's names became an instant sensation. Even an unknown actress landing the female lead would skyrocket to stardom overnight—proof of Ivory Phoenix Productions' uncompromising standards.

Lydia Bennett's brow furrowed with concern. "I saw online that 'Ambermyst' was something you wrote years ago. Do you still remember all the details? I've heard Sebastian can be... challenging. If he objects, even Mr. Vaughn might not be able to secure your spot."

Sebastian's reputation was legendary. Some called him arrogant, while others claimed his aloofness was a shield against industry scandals.

Vivian gave Lydia's hand a reassuring squeeze. "Relax. I could recite my work in my sleep. Let's not keep them waiting."

She hadn't been just another scriptwriter chasing deadlines back then—every sentence had been crafted with her soul. Her stories lived in her bones, and no challenge could shake her confidence.

When they entered the office, Damien Vaughn was absent. Instead, a young man sprawled across the sofa like a lazy panther, his designer ripped hoodie and jeans screaming calculated indifference. His long legs claimed half the room's space, a physical declaration of his disinterest.

His razor-sharp jawline and smoldering eyes painted a complex portrait—equal parts playful and intimidating. The rumors hadn't lied about his unapproachable aura.

Sebastian's career was the stuff of legends. Debuted at nineteen with a boy band, he'd conquered global stages, collecting platinum records and establishing himself as the group's undeniable leader.

After breaking free from a predatory agency, he'd launched a solo career that shattered records. His first romantic lead role had cemented his A-list status, a throne he'd never vacated since. His co-stars were either industry veterans or prodigies with extraordinary talent. If anyone had earned the right to be selective, it was him.

Vivian's entrance earned her a fleeting glance from Sebastian, his eyes sweeping over her before returning to his phone with palpable disinterest.

Just then, Damien emerged from the inner office with a smile. "Ah, you're here."

Sebastian's attitude didn't faze Vivian—to her, he was just another variable in the production equation. She strode forward confidently. "Good morning, Mr. Vaughn, Mr. Hartwell." With a gesture toward her companion, she added, "This is my agent, Lydia Bennett."

Sebastian unfolded himself with theatrical slowness, his voice laced with sarcasm. "Are we here for tea and crumpets, or shall we actually begin the audition?"

Vivian knew she wasn't everyone's cup of tea, but such open hostility from a stranger was puzzling. She mentally scanned her memories for any past conflicts. Nothing surfaced. The only person in Hollywood she genuinely disliked was Serena Whitmore. Ironically, she'd heard Sebastian himself couldn't stand Serena, making his current attitude even more baffling.

Damien nodded at Lydia and stepped forward, his movements measured as he worked to diffuse the tension. "I watched your 'Blazing Horizon' audition clips online," he began. "Vivian displayed remarkable emotional range. Today, let's explore the pivotal misunderstanding scene between the leads."

As his fingers brushed the script, Sebastian abruptly stood and intercepted it, pressing the pages flat against the desk. "Why limit her to familiar territory?" he challenged. "Compelling performances thrive on unpredictability. The rawest moments happen off-script. What if we improvise instead?"
###Chapter 88

Vivian Hartley, who had been silently watching, felt the tension crackling between them. Her instincts sharpened: Sebastian Hartwell clearly had an ulterior motive concerning her.

With deliberate casualness, she replied, "I'm flexible. You pick the scene."

Damien Vaughn studied both actors, his gaze heavy with unspoken knowledge. "Since you're both amenable, I'll choose a scene at random."

Though officially overseeing the audition, Damien remained doubtful of Vivian's abilities. Future collaborations required tact, and he hesitated to be overly critical. His main hope was that she could meet basic acting standards.

With Sebastian having initiated this challenge, Damien was privately eager to observe their chemistry.

After carefully shuffling the scripts, he randomly selected one and handed copies to Vivian and Sebastian.

Vivian quickly absorbed her lines, her posture shifting as she prepared. "Ready when you are," she declared with quiet assurance.

Sebastian's expression darkened. "Every word in 'Ambermyst' was carefully chosen," he criticized. "How can you possibly grasp the subtleties with just a quick glance?"

Vivian blinked in surprise. Did he not realize she was the script's original author under her pen name? Revealing that now would feel forced. Instead, she countered with controlled sharpness, "My skills will speak for themselves during the performance. Unless..." She tilted her head. "Are you having trouble with your own lines? If you need more time, I'm happy to wait."

Her polite tone barely concealed her steel. Sebastian's constant challenges had ignited her competitive fire.

"You're quite arrogant," Sebastian muttered, displeasure flashing in his eyes. He set down his script. "Let's begin."

Having analyzed the script countless times, Sebastian knew every scene by heart. His goal from the start had been clear: test Vivian, hoping she'd stumble during the audition.

Recognizing his strategy, Vivian poured her entire artistic soul into the performance. As the scene unfolded, her interpretation shattered Sebastian's lowest expectations. Her delivery and emotional depth showed no trace of amateurism.

Their interaction flowed with unexpected harmony—each beat perfectly timed, their chemistry electric and genuine.

When the scene ended, Sebastian found himself wanting more. True to his principles, he acknowledged his earlier mistake.

Approaching Vivian, he offered a sincere apology. "I never expected you to understand Katrina's script so profoundly. My initial judgment was embarrassingly narrow. I apologize."

Sebastian's motivation stemmed not from personal bias but from fierce protection of his idol's work. Modern romance dramas often prioritized looks and social media fame over talent. Previous auditions had featured influencers with weak acting skills, resulting in shallow performances.

So when an unknown actress like Vivian arrived—beautiful and seemingly inexperienced—Sebastian had dismissed her as another well-connected pretty face.
###Chapter 89

Vivian's brow furrowed in confusion. Hadn't Damien already introduced her to Sebastian?

Damien sauntered over with a playful smirk, his voice dripping with amusement. "Sebastian, I've been keeping a little secret. Vivian here is actually Katrina. Knowing you're her biggest fan, I deliberately kept quiet - worried you'd be too starstruck to think straight."

"What?" Sebastian's usually composed features shattered into shock, his eyes widening comically.

The realization hit them simultaneously - they'd both been expertly played by Damien. Sebastian's stoic mask completely dissolved, revealing a fascinating parade of emotions - embarrassment, disbelief, and profound regret playing across his chiseled features. He cleared his throat awkwardly. "Your screenplay... it's truly remarkable."

The memory of his dismissive behavior during their first meeting with his literary idol now filled him with acute mortification.

Damien, utterly unrepentant, practically vibrated with excitement. "This is perfect!" he exclaimed. "I've hit the jackpot!"

Without hesitation, he produced the contract and confirmed filming dates. The paperwork had been prepared in advance, with generous terms - thirty episodes over four months, with compensation set at five million.

While modest for A-list actresses, it represented top-tier pay for a complete newcomer like Vivian.

Vivian reviewed the document carefully before passing it to Lydia, who settled onto a nearby couch for a meticulous line-by-line examination.

Leaning close, Damien whispered conspiratorially, "Should I thank Mr. Blackwood for keeping you hidden? His oversight allowed me to discover such extraordinary talent."

Glancing subtly at Lydia, Vivian lowered her voice. "Very few people know about this. I'd appreciate your discretion."

"We're divorcing soon, and I prefer to keep him separate from my professional life."

Damien's eyebrows shot up. "Not even your agent knows?"

In their industry, most would leverage any connection to Adrian Blackwood. Serena Whitmore, for instance, knew exactly how to exploit such influential ties. Vivian seemed determined to maintain distance instead.

Was this remarkable independence? Or something more complex - love turned complicated?

After a thoughtful pause, Vivian explained, "I haven't actively concealed anything. My contract has no clauses about relationships or marriage. Since marrying, I simply haven't been present at the company. At this point, mentioning it seems unnecessary."

Though burning with curiosity, Damien tactfully restrained himself. "Understood. My lips are sealed."

Lydia's review was exhaustive. She scrutinized every clause multiple times before finally permitting Vivian's signature.

Post-signing, Damien outlined two critical points. "First, I'll announce your collaboration with Sebastian on Twitter soon, but without mentioning Katrina or our 'Ambermyst' production. After consulting executives, we've decided to keep Katrina's involvement confidential. We'll have NDAs prepared. Given our substantial investment, we're maintaining low profile initially."

Sebastian and Vivian nodded their understanding.
###Chapter 90

Leaning casually against the polished mahogany table, Sebastian arched an eyebrow. "And the second matter?"

Reginald Kingsley, the primary investor of 'Ambermyst,' is hosting Spotlight Night this weekend," Damien Vaughn continued smoothly. "Sebastian, would you consider attending?"

A frown creased Sebastian's handsome features as he shook his head. "I'm committed to Blazing Horizon's international filming this weekend. Can't possibly return."

His gaze shifted to Vivian, an uncharacteristic warmth softening his expression. "This opportunity might be better suited for Katrina—I mean, Vivian. As a rising star, networking at such events would be invaluable."

Ever since discovering Vivian's true identity as the brilliant writer Katrina Spencer, Sebastian had undergone a dramatic transformation—from cold skepticism to something resembling devoted admiration.

Damien turned his piercing gaze toward Vivian, silently seeking her response.

The evening of Spotlight Night arrived, transforming Harbor Grand Hotel into a glittering spectacle. When Vivian entered on Damien's arm, the entire ballroom seemed to hold its breath.

Damien cut a striking figure in his ivory tuxedo with diamond-encrusted epaulets, looking every bit the storybook prince bathed in celestial light. His platinum hair caught the chandelier's glow, creating an almost ethereal aura.

Beside him, Vivian wore a daring crimson silk gown that would have overwhelmed lesser women. Yet on her, the vibrant fabric became a masterpiece—a rare tropical blossom against fresh snow. Her natural elegance outshone even the most extravagant jewels in the room. Those luminous eyes, deep as twilight, seemed to dim the chandelier's thousand crystals.

Murmurs rippled through the crowd: "Which elite family does she belong to? That poise! That grace!"

Noticing Vivian's momentary distraction, Damien leaned in closer.

"Relax," he murmured, his breath warm against her ear.

Vivian nodded, refocusing. Her fingers tightened slightly around the engraved invitation card—its intricate design triggering a strange sense of déjà vu, though the memory remained frustratingly just out of reach.

Reginald Kingsley approached—a man in his prime who defied conventional expectations of middle age. His energetic stride and sharp eyes put most younger men to shame. Generosity and intelligence radiated from his every gesture.

As CEO of Kingsley Studios and primary backer of "Ambermyst," he carried undeniable authority. A uniformed waiter trailed behind with a tray of champagne flutes.

Selecting two glasses, Reginald offered one to Damien. "Mr. Vaughn, what an unexpected pleasure. You're not known for making social appearances."

His observation held truth. Damien's notorious discretion explained why Vivian, despite years at Ivory Phoenix Productions, had never crossed paths with him before, and why tabloids struggled to capture his image.

Damien accepted the champagne with a gracious nod. "How could I refuse your invitation, Mr. Kingsley?"

Turning to Vivian, he made the introduction. "This is our lead actress for the upcoming series. I thought it beneficial for her to make your acquaintance."
###Chapter 91

Vivian moved with effortless elegance, her steps measured and poised. She offered her hand with practiced grace. "Vivian Hartley. It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Kingsley."

Reginald's handshake was firm yet brief, his lips curling into an amused smile as he glanced at Damien. "No surprise you chose to attend tonight. Supporting such exquisite talent is indeed... compelling. Though most would keep such beauty discreetly reserved, not displayed so publicly." His implication was clear - he assumed Vivian to be Damien's romantic interest.

Vivian remained composed, her expression unreadable. She recognized this dance of corporate politics - Reginald was testing boundaries, probing whether Damien was leveraging investments for personal gain.

Damien caught the veiled accusation instantly. "Mr. Kingsley, let's not make assumptions." His voice carried quiet authority. "Vivian and I maintain a strictly professional relationship. Having secured your investment, we vet all talent with meticulous care. While she's new to this industry, I have every confidence her performance will surpass expectations."

His professional admiration for Vivian was genuine. Tonight's event served multiple purposes - introducing Vivian to key players while navigating the treacherous waters of industry politics, complicated further by his family's intricate dynamics and the cutthroat competition simmering beneath the surface.

Reginald's smile remained inscrutable. "I look forward to witnessing the surprise you've promised."

As their conversation concluded, the energy in the room shifted perceptibly. A circle of networkers immediately surrounded Damien, while several eligible bachelors - now aware Vivian wasn't romantically attached - began making calculated approaches.

In a dimly lit corner, Serena observed the unfolding scene, her fingers tightening around her champagne flute until her knuckles turned white. The bitter taste of exclusion burned her throat.

Serena had made her entrance with deliberate grace, her emerald-green gown shimmering under the chandeliers, the diamond necklace from Adrian catching the light with every movement. She'd spent hours perfecting her appearance, determined to command attention among the elite.

Yet in this gathering of old money and established power, her carefully constructed image seemed to evaporate. The high society crowd regarded her with polite indifference that stung more than outright rejection. Despite her rising fame, she remained an outsider - the women exchanging subtle, knowing glances, the men maintaining careful distance out of respect for Adrian's implied claim.

Only a handful of desperate aspiring actors acknowledged her presence. The rest of the room might as well have looked straight through her.

Unconsciously, Serena's grip on her glass tightened, the stem threatening to snap. Her gaze kept returning to Vivian, the comparison unavoidable.

When Vivian had married Adrian, even those who initially dismissed her eventually offered grudging respect. Now, about to be divorced and stripped of the Blackwood name, Vivian should have been just another industry newcomer.

Yet somehow she still commanded Damien's attention with that infuriating natural poise. Serena had clawed her way up, seized every opportunity, yet could never achieve the effortless grace Vivian displayed in these social minefields. The injustice of it burned like acid in her veins.

Her attention snapped to the entrance where Margaret and Bianca had arrived. Margaret had always been notoriously critical of women in Adrian's orbit who didn't meet her exacting standards.

Serena knew better than to confront her directly, but an opportunity for subtle manipulation presented itself. After a calculated pause, she glided toward Bianca, her movement as precise as a chess player advancing her queen.

###Chapter 92

Vivian's fingers tightened around her champagne flute as she spotted Bianca across the crowded ballroom. The crystal stem nearly slipped from her grasp before she steadied herself with a practiced smile. "Bianca! What a delightful surprise," she cooed, gliding toward the younger woman with calculated grace. "You're absolutely glowing tonight."

The tension in Bianca's shoulders eased marginally. After all, Vivian had recently proven useful in undermining that upstart Vivian Hartley. Perhaps this conversation might yield some entertainment.

"Ms. Whitmore," Bianca acknowledged with icy politeness, her gaze flickering toward the exit. "I hadn't expected to see you here."

Vivian then turned her attention to Margaret Blackwood, dipping into a shallow curtsy. "Madam Blackwood, you outshine every jewel in this room tonight." The syrupy compliment dripped from her lips like honey.

Margaret barely spared her a glance, already pivoting toward the terrace with a dismissive hum.

But Vivian wasn't finished. With a subtle nod toward where Vivian Hartley stood near the grand piano, she feigned sudden recognition. "Oh! Isn't that Ms. Hartley over there? I didn't realize you'd all arrived together."

Margaret's expression remained impassive, but Bianca's grip on her aunt's arm turned vice-like. "She's here?" Bianca's voice cracked like a whip. "Aunt Margaret, no wonder Adrian claimed he had no extra invitations when I asked. He must have given his to her!"

Bianca's cheeks flushed with indignation. She'd practically begged Adrian for access to this exclusive gala, only to be turned away empty-handed. Being Margaret's plus-one already stung her pride - discovering Vivian Hartley had received Adrian's personal invitation made the humiliation unbearable.

Margaret patted her niece's clenched fist with detached calm. "You're here now, aren't you?"

Vivian seized the opportunity with a carefully timed gasp. "Oh dear, so Adrian personally invited her? How... interesting. Though I did notice she arrived with Mr. Vaughn. Rumor has it they've become quite close while collaborating on that new Ivory Phoenix production."

Bianca's laugh held no warmth. "Using our family's connections to parade around with some B-list producer? Pathetic. That studio barely qualifies as mid-tier - does she actually think rubbing elbows here will earn her respect? If our social circle catches wind of this acting nonsense, it's Adrian's reputation that'll suffer."

The venom in her words lashed out indiscriminately, even grazing Vivian who stood beside her.

Vivian absorbed the unintended slight without flinching, her smile never wavering. "Now, now," she soothed, pitching her voice to a conspiratorial murmur, "with the right project and a few well-placed awards, perceptions can change remarkably. I happen to know a screenwriter who could give Vivian Hartley herself a run for her money..."

Her strategy unfolded like a poisonous flower - offering help while planting seeds of doubt.

"Please," Bianca scoffed, rolling her eyes. "Awards? For what - her stellar performance folding laundry? She's only here to exploit the Blackwood name. Nothing more."

Vivian swirled her champagne thoughtfully. "Even the most inexperienced actress can shine with proper guidance. If Ms. Hartley is serious about her career, I'd be happy to make introductions..."

Meanwhile, near the dessert table, Vivian Hartley felt the weight of hostile stares pressing against her skin. Spotting an escape route, she discreetly slipped toward the balcony doors, the murmur of malicious gossip fading behind her.
###Chapter 93

Vivian's breath caught when she noticed Serena deep in conversation with Margaret Blackwood and Bianca Thornton. She had intended to slip past unnoticed, but a particular phrase made her pause mid-step.

Her ears burned as she realized they were discussing her.

Serena was offering to introduce her to industry connections? Including a screenwriter supposedly on par with Vivian Hartley herself? The irony was almost laughable.

Setting down her champagne flute with deliberate care, Vivian approached Margaret with practiced grace. "Mrs. Blackwood," she greeted with measured politeness.

"Vivian." Margaret's response was clipped, her smile not reaching her eyes.

Social appearances meant everything to Margaret. Though she clearly despised Vivian, she'd rather die than cause a scene at such a public event.

Bianca stood nearby, her gaze so venomous Vivian could almost feel it pricking her skin. The younger woman's eyes raked over Vivian's ensemble with barely concealed envy. How did this nobody carry herself with such effortless elegance? Even that bold emerald green—a color that would make most women look garish—only accentuated her poise. How could someone from such a nouveau riche family possess such natural refinement?

Vivian met Serena's gaze directly, her voice crisp. "Ms. Whitmore, there's no need to concern yourself with my professional connections. If you have such valuable resources at your disposal, I suggest you utilize them for your own benefit rather than wasting them on me."

Though they looked down on her, Vivian had no intention of revealing her true identity as the acclaimed screenwriter Vivian Hartley—her most carefully guarded secret.

Bianca, still smarting from the earlier confrontation about invitations, couldn't resist sneering, "Acting so high and mighty about not needing help? Then why even show up at these events?"

Serena jumped in with exaggerated enthusiasm. "This screenwriter has several major hits under her belt—some say her work rivals Vivian Hartley's. If you're interested, I'd be happy to arrange an introduction."

The claim was laughable. Screenwriters of Vivian Hartley's caliber were unicorns in the industry. Serena's offer was clearly disingenuous—even if she knew such a writer, securing a meeting would be nearly impossible.

Vivian's smile remained unshaken. "I'm quite satisfied with my current project's screenwriter."

Serena's eyes sparkled with mischief. "How loyal of you. Though if I recall correctly, wasn't Damien Vaughn also a screenwriter? His works never quite achieved commercial success, did they?" She paused dramatically. "Ah, but given your... close relationship, of course you'd want to support his work. My apologies for overstepping."

The implication was clear—Serena was subtly suggesting an inappropriate relationship between Vivian and Damien.

Bianca gasped theatrically, lowering her voice to a scandalized whisper. "You're involved with another man? Vivian, you're married!" Her eyes darted around nervously, clearly torn between wanting to cause a scene and fearing the social repercussions.

Vivian's expression darkened. "My personal life is none of your concern," she said icily, recognizing Bianca as nothing more than Serena's pawn—too naive to understand the larger game being played.

"You—!" Bianca sputtered, stamping her foot in frustration.

The tension crackled between them like static before a storm.
###Chapter 94

Vivian turned to Margaret, her lips forming a perfect pout. "Aunt Margaret, just look at how she's acting!"

Margaret Blackwood, who had remained silent until this moment, finally spoke. Her voice was like ice cutting through the tension. "You may think this isn't my concern, but I assure you it is."

Margaret's blatant favoritism toward Bianca was almost comical in its transparency. Vivian had always suspected Margaret was the type to blindly prioritize family loyalty above all else. But as time passed, she realized the dynamics were far more complex. Even Victor seemed desperate to marry his daughter into some influential family for personal gain. Apparently, this was just how the Blackwoods operated.

Vivian parted her lips but said nothing. Instead, she lowered her gaze, the picture of demure submission.

Margaret's rebuke was sharp and deliberate. "You're embarrassing our family. I don't care about your private affairs, but here, in public, as a Blackwood, you must uphold our reputation. You represent our image and must act accordingly. This isn't some casual ladies' tea party. It's inappropriate to be seen with a stranger, let alone follow him here. Now, come with me."

"My apologies," Vivian murmured, her tone respectful and seemingly compliant, as if nothing had fundamentally changed.

For a fleeting moment, Margaret's stern expression softened, but Vivian's next words froze it again.

Vivian clutched the fabric of her dress, her voice barely above a whisper but filled with quiet determination. "But I can't leave. My employer is still here, and it would be improper to abandon him mid-event. As a professional, I can't risk tarnishing the Blackwood name by acting irresponsibly."

Margaret's piercing gaze locked onto Vivian, cold realization dawning in her eyes. She let out a derisive laugh. "Now I see your true colors. I wish Leonard and Beatrice could witness this carefully constructed facade of yours."

Bianca chimed in with malicious delight, "Look at you, Vivian. You're practically defying Aunt Margaret now!"

Serena, the architect of this confrontation, wore a faint smile of satisfaction. Having achieved her goal, she decided not to escalate things further. Glancing at her phone, she said with calculated politeness, "Mrs. Blackwood, Bianca, Ms. Hartley, I have matters to attend to. Please enjoy the rest of your evening."

"Margaret, I've been away too long. My boss might be looking for me," Vivian interjected quickly, fabricating an excuse to escape. "I should return now."

Margaret's eyes burned into Vivian's retreating figure, her anger palpable. Seeking privacy, she pulled out her phone and dialed Adrian. "Did you know Vivian attended the Kingsley Group's gala?" she demanded.

Adrian's response was calm. "Yes, I gave her the invitation. She's been emotionally fragile since the incident."

"I thought the Harbor Grand's desserts might cheer her up," Adrian added, though his words barely registered over Margaret's frustration.

"I've heard rumors about her involvement with some playboy from the Vaughn family. You need to control her better before people discover she's your wife. She's barely been part of this family, and already she's damaging our reputation."

Margaret had long tolerated Vivian's modest background, hoping for a grandchild. But Vivian's apparent attempts to leverage her status as Mrs. Blackwood, combined with the absence of any pregnancy, were testing her patience to its limits.
###Chapter 95

Adrian's patience was wearing thin. "I'm in the middle of something important," he snapped into the phone. "If you're unhappy, just bring her home yourself."

Margaret's biting sarcasm crackled through the line. "Bring her home? She won't even acknowledge my existence! Your precious wife values the housekeeper's opinion more than mine."

Adrian could practically see the steam coming from his mother's ears. With an exhausted exhale, he surrendered. "Fine. I'll handle it."

Twenty-three minutes later, Adrian stormed into the glittering venue, his tailored suit slightly rumpled from rushing. Dark circles shadowed his eyes after consecutive all-nighters finalizing the merger. The last thing he needed was to play referee in this petty drama.

His piercing gaze swept the room before landing on Vivian. There she stood by the champagne tower, laughing with a group of tuxedo-clad men, her emerald dress clinging to curves that made his blood boil. The plunging neckline was borderline scandalous - a far cry from the modest elegance he'd come to expect from her.

This had Serena's fingerprints all over it. Determined to extract Vivian immediately, Adrian took an aggressive step forward only to be intercepted by security.

"Invitation, sir?" The guard held out a hand, blocking his path.

Adrian jerked his chin toward Vivian. "That's my wife. She has our invitation."

The guard eyed Adrian skeptically. His rolled-up sleeves and lack of visible designer labels contrasted sharply with the black-tie crowd. Yet something in Adrian's commanding presence gave the man pause.

"I'll verify with the lady," the guard conceded before approaching Vivian.

"Madam, a gentleman claims to be your escort. Shall I admit him?"

Vivian followed the guard's gesture and froze. There stood Adrian, his usual impeccable appearance slightly disheveled. Her stomach twisted. Only one person could have summoned him here so quickly - Serena.

The timing was too perfect. She'd just rejected Serena's fake olive branch, and now Adrian came charging in like some white knight. This was clearly another setup.

Forcing a neutral expression, Vivian strode toward the entrance. At an event like this, invitations were practically disposable - she'd heard Bianca mentioning extras earlier. No doubt Adrian had given his to Serena.

Was this Serena's new tactic? Weaponizing Adrian against her? Vivian nearly rolled her eyes at the predictability.

"You're looking for your darling Serena?" Vivian's voice dripped ice as she stopped before Adrian. "She's probably waiting with open arms somewhere."

Adrian's jaw clenched at her frigid tone, so different from the warmth she'd shown those strangers. The contrast stung more than he'd admit.

"What ridiculous accusation is that?" he growled, irritation flashing in his stormy eyes. "Why must you always drag Serena into everything? I used to think you misunderstood her, but now I see the truth - you're deliberately targeting her!"
###Chapter 96

Vivian arched one perfectly sculpted eyebrow with the indifference of a queen dismissing an insignificant subject. "Yes, darling, I'm the villainess of this little drama. Are we done here? Or do you need to deliver another monologue about my shortcomings? If not, consider your message received."

She pivoted on her stiletto heels, but Adrian's broad frame materialized before her like an immovable fortress. "You're not stepping inside without me."

Crossing her arms, Vivian met his stormy gaze without flinching. "Not tonight, Blackwood. Find your own way in."

A harsh laugh escaped Adrian's lips, his jaw tightening visibly. "You're holding my damn invitation. What's your game now?"

Vivian's crimson lips pursed. She'd arrived with Damien. When exactly had Adrian entrusted her with anything?

The escalating tension drew Damien's attention. He approached with measured steps, nodding at Adrian before turning to Vivian. "Trouble?"

The flustered waiter saw salvation in Damien's arrival. Before Vivian could respond, he blurted, "Mr. Vaughn, this gentleman claims Miss Hartley has his invitation."

Damien assessed the situation instantly. "This is Mr. Kingsley's business associate and CEO of Blackwood Group," he explained smoothly. "An invitation would never be an issue for him. Clearly a misunderstanding. You may return to your post - I'll escort Mr. Blackwood personally."

The waiter practically fled in relief.

Turning to Adrian, Damien added context. "Vivian accompanied me as Mr. Kingsley invested in our new production. That tiny evening bag couldn't possibly hold an invitation. You've made an incorrect assumption, Mr. Blackwood."

Adrian's expression darkened as realization dawned. Yet that familiar irritation simmered beneath his polished exterior. Why would she arrive with this unassuming filmmaker when she could have commanded her own entrance? Was this another calculated provocation?

His original purpose - to speak with Margaret - now seemed trivial compared to this new development. Shrugging off his tailored jacket, he moved to drape it over Vivian's bare shoulders. "What the hell are you wearing? We'll table our history for now, but you're coming with me."

Vivian sidestepped gracefully, letting the jacket fall. "My wardrobe choices ceased being your concern when I filed for divorce. Or did you forget the paperwork?"

"We're still legally married." Adrian's voice dropped to a dangerous register.

"I've moved out and submitted the documents." Vivian held her ground. "If you continue being difficult, the court will handle it after the mandatory separation period."

Reginald noticed the commotion and approached. "Mr. Blackwood! Had I known you were attending..."

Sensing Vivian's discomfort, Damien smoothly intervened. "Mr. Blackwood, several investors have been asking about our film's progress. I'll take Vivian to greet them. My apologies for the poor hospitality - allow me to make it up with dinner later."

Vivian shot Damien a grateful smile and followed his lead.

Ever the observant spectator, Reginald chuckled as he watched them go. "The beauty Mr. Vaughn brought is quite extraordinary. At first glance, one might assume she's his latest muse. Though both insist otherwise."
###Chapter 97

Adrian's reply was frosty and abrupt. "They're not compatible."

Reginald arched an eyebrow, mistaking the comment as criticism toward Vivian. "Well, everyone has their preferences. You've always valued character over superficial charm, Mr. Blackwood."

Adrian, irritated and weary, merely gave a dismissive grunt.

Margaret's approach caught Reginald's attention. "Mr. Blackwood, you're here to meet your mother?" He greeted her with practiced warmth. "Mrs. Blackwood, you should have notified me of your arrival. With today's crowd, I apologize for not receiving you properly."

After exchanging formalities, Reginald tactfully withdrew, sensing the palpable tension surrounding the Blackwood family.

Margaret didn't mince words, her tone razor-sharp. "Where's Vivian?"

Bianca, ever the eager tattletale, scanned the venue and pointed. "Aunt Margaret, over there - chatting with that Vaughn man again!"

Margaret's expression soured instantly. Her voice cut through the air like a whip. "Why aren't you controlling your wife better? What kind of impression does it give when she's cozying up to another man at such an important function?"

Bianca, never one to miss an opportunity to stir trouble, added with feigned concern, "Exactly, Aunt Margaret! Think of the gossip this could spark. The Blackwood name doesn't need this kind of scandal."

Adrian massaged his temples, feeling the onset of a migraine. His patience wearing thin, he retorted sharply, "Damien and Vivian are discussing business. This is a professional event - networking is expected. There's nothing improper about working at a party."

Margaret's frown deepened, her displeasure turning to open contempt. "So that's your stance? You'd rather play peacemaker than hold her accountable? Fine, if you won't handle it, I will." She turned decisively to Bianca. "Fetch Vivian immediately."

Bianca's eyes gleamed with malicious delight. Like a soldier given orders, she marched toward Vivian and seized her wrist. "Aunt Margaret demands you come with us now."

Vivian, aware of the curious glances directed their way, allowed herself to be led to a secluded corner before shaking off Bianca's grip with quiet dignity. "Bianca, let's be clear - I'm your cousin's wife, a Blackwood by marriage, not some errand girl for the Thorntons. Remember your place."

Bianca smirked, barely containing her smugness. "Oh please, spare me the lecture. I'm just delivering a message. Aunt Margaret thinks you should stop making a spectacle of yourself, flirting with every man in sight. The Blackwoods don't need a daughter-in-law with questionable morals."

Vivian laughed, the sound brittle and cold. "How convenient. I don't wish to remain a Blackwood daughter-in-law anyway. Adrian already has the divorce papers. If Margaret's so concerned, perhaps she should convince her precious son to sign them so we can both move forward."

Bianca's smirk faltered, replaced by genuine shock. "You're joking. After everything you've done to secure your place in this family? Why throw away this wealth, this status?"

The unspoken question hung heavily between them. Deep down, Bianca knew Vivian loved Adrian, even if she masked it with indifference now. That love had cost Vivian dearly - her pride, her peace, perhaps even her identity.
###Chapter 98

Vivian couldn't suppress the sharp pang of jealousy twisting in her chest. If she had the opportunity to stand beside someone like Dominic, she'd cling to him like ivy on a stone wall. Despite her privileged upbringing, she'd never experienced the warmth of a genuine relationship.

Damien merely arched an eyebrow, his voice laced with quiet amusement. "Have I ever taken a single penny from the Blackwood fortune for personal gain?"

Bianca faltered. The truth burned her tongue, yet pride sealed her lips. She launched her counterattack instead. "Are you seriously claiming you don't love Adrian anymore?"

Vivian's features turned to ice, her words precise as surgical steel. "Love is for those who can afford it. And he's not worth the price."

Adrian approached, expecting to find Bianca harassing Vivian. Instead, he witnessed Vivian declaring her emotional emancipation with chilling clarity. The realization cut deeper than any blade.

The woman before him had transformed into a panther - all coiled tension and unsheathed claws.

Silent suffering no longer existed in her vocabulary.

Adrian's calm facade cracked, revealing molten fury beneath. "Vivian, bad behavior comes naturally to you while virtues require effort. You've accomplished nothing, yet speak with such arrogance. Marriage isn't about fleeting passion - it's about duty."

Damien stepped between them, his voice carrying the weight of authority. "Mr. Blackwood, this is a public venue. Mind your language. If any unflattering photos of my leading lady surface because of your outburst, I'll hold you personally responsible." His gaze hardened. "Besides, publicly berating a woman reflects poorly on your character."

Adrian's eyes darkened as he moved to claim his territory beside Vivian. "I'm speaking to my wife. This doesn't concern you."

Damien ignored the challenge, offering Vivian his arm instead. "Let me make up for tonight's unpleasantness. Allow me to escort you home."

Just as Vivian seemed inclined to accept, Adrian's fingers closed like manacles around her wrist. "You're coming with me."

Vivian's gaze flickered between the two men.

When she finally met Adrian's eyes, her voice could have frozen hell itself. "Mr. Blackwood, remember your position and act accordingly."

Once, her eyes had held galaxies of devotion for him - entire constellations of unspoken adoration. Now they reflected only glacial emptiness, as if every trace of love had been surgically removed.

Adrian stood paralyzed, the sensation of something precious slipping through his fingers like sand.

Seizing the moment, Vivian extracted her wrist with deliberate grace. Without sparing Adrian another glance, she departed with Damien, her retreating figure radiating finality.

Margaret descended upon Adrian, her frustration palpable. "He's jeopardized the Blackwood reputation for Vivian's sake, and you still question their relationship? Must you catch them in flagrante to believe it? My patience with you has evaporated," she snapped, each word a stinging rebuke.

Adrian remained silent, his gaze fixed on the empty doorway where Vivian had vanished. A single question echoed through his mind like a death knell: Was there truly something between Vivian and Damien?

When Adrian failed to respond, Margaret exhaled sharply and turned to Bianca. "Come, Bianca. We're leaving."

###Chapter 99

Vivian gave in with visible reluctance, throwing one last uncertain glance at the thinning crowd before ducking her head and trailing after Margaret.

The gala was dying down, and the chances of Dominic showing up now seemed slimmer by the minute.

Just as the chauffeur pulled the gleaming Bentley to the curb outside Harbor Grand Hotel, Vivian and Damien emerged. Damien swept open the car door with theatrical grace. "My enchanting muse," he purred, "would you grant me the pleasure of dining at the new sky lounge? You've barely touched your food tonight, and I must make amends for my negligence."

Vivian stood firm. "Damien," she began bluntly, "you know my situation. Adrian and I are still legally married, and I'm just establishing my foothold in this industry. My career comes first. In this age of relentless media scrutiny, even innocent interactions get twisted beyond recognition. A single snapshot could birth a thousand tabloid fantasies. Professional distance protects us both and preserves the integrity of our current project."

Damien's smile held a tinge of melancholy. "I deeply admire you and genuinely hoped for friendship. But you've articulated the complications perfectly. Perhaps when you've reached the zenith of stardom, such rumors will cease to matter—"

"Then I'll personally invite you to that sky lounge," Vivian finished smoothly. "We'll watch snowflakes dance under moonlight while discussing screenwriting and our shared love of literature."

"That day will come," Damien affirmed with conviction.

After exchanging final pleasantries, Damien offered to see her home.

Vivian declined, waving her phone. "I'll just call a cab," she stated firmly.

Across the bustling avenue, Natasha—who'd grown restless accompanying her parents shopping during her mother's endless wardrobe trials—had slipped away for a smoothie. Spotting Vivian with a distinguished silver-haired gentleman near the ostentatious Bentley, she froze.

Though she couldn't make out his face clearly, the car alone screamed old money and influence.

Natasha burned to confront them, but the relentless traffic formed an impassable barrier.

By the time the crosswalk signal turned green, Vivian, the mystery man, and the luxury vehicle had dissolved into the night—leaving only unanswered questions.

Fuming, Natasha hurled her drink onto the pavement, the plastic cup exploding in a sticky burst.

"Natasha! What's gotten into you?" Richard's voice cut through her rage as he approached, his expression torn between concern and indulgence.

Natasha glared at the river of honking cars. "I just saw Vivian with some Rolls-Royce-driving silver fox," she spat, venom dripping from each word.

Richard's brow furrowed. "Could it have been Adrian? Maybe they've reconciled after all."

After Vivian's terse phone call, Richard had discreetly checked court records. Finding no divorce filings, he'd assumed her separation talk was just another tantrum—one that would inevitably blow over.

Natasha scoffed. "Please! That wasn't Adrian. Couldn't see his face clearly, but the guy had ridiculous platinum hair. Definitely not your precious son-in-law."
###Chapter 100

Natasha's lips curled in disdain as she studied the photo. That ridiculous silver hair screamed desperate attention-seeking—all flash with no substance. Whatever wealth or influence this stranger possessed, he could never measure up to Adrian Blackwood's commanding presence.

Richard's brow furrowed. "Vivian? With another man? That makes no sense. She's utterly devoted to Adrian. They're still legally married. Why would she jeopardize everything?"

Though Richard held little affection for his daughter, he couldn't deny her fierce loyalty—a trait inherited from her late mother. When Vivian loved, she loved with terrifying permanence.

But Natasha's eyes glittered with malicious intent. "Maybe she's not cheating, but their marriage is clearly crumbling. Men like that don't miss opportunities. If someone influential sets his sights on her..." She let the implication hang in the air. "The Blackwoods would never tolerate such a scandal."

Her smile turned predatory. Divorce would destroy Vivian while paving Natasha's path to becoming Mrs. Blackwood.

Richard seemed oblivious to her scheming tone. He waved a dismissive hand. "Drop it, Natasha. Whatever mess she's in doesn't concern us. Even if she remains married to Adrian, there's nothing left for us to gain."

Natasha wasn't ready to concede. A cunning idea took shape behind her sharp gaze. "Father, remember Maxwell Sterling?"

Richard gave a curt nod. "What about him?"

Her smirk widened with quiet triumph. "He's still obsessed with Vivian. We could use that to our advantage."

Maxwell Sterling, sole heir to the Sterling fortune, had once been Richard's chosen match for Vivian. Even after her marriage to Adrian, Maxwell's obsession had festered—a toxic blend of unrequited passion and bitter envy.

If Vivian divorced, she'd lose Adrian's formidable protection. Natasha had learned this during a private gathering where a drunken Maxwell had bared his soul.

"Think about it," Natasha pressed, her voice honeyed with persuasion. "If we steer him toward Vivian, we could regain the Sterlings' favor. Those old promises they made? Still valid. And right now, our family desperately needs their connections."

Richard exhaled heavily, skepticism darkening his features. "Vivian would never agree. She rejected Maxwell without hesitation—that's how she ended up with Adrian. Last time I mentioned the Sterlings, she blocked my number. Besides, no man would dare approach Adrian Blackwood's wife."

It would be social suicide. Vivian's fiery rejection still stung—a humiliation Richard had no desire to repeat.

But Natasha remained undeterred. "Everyone has a weakness, Father. Find it, and even the strongest will crumble." Her words hung like a poised dagger until an icy voice interrupted.

A woman draped in couture elegance stepped forward, her wintery gaze sharp with calculation.

Daphne Fairchild, Richard's second wife, had emerged from her boutique shopping spree. A sardonic smile played on her lips as she joined the conversation. "If Maxwell Sterling wants to taste what belongs to Adrian Blackwood, why should we care? In fact..." Her eyes gleamed. "It might solve all our problems."

Several days later, just as dawn painted the sky, persistent knocking tore Vivian from sleep.

###Chapter 101

Vivian blinked away the remnants of sleep as she stumbled toward the door.

The frantic knocking shattered her drowsiness instantly, sending adrenaline coursing through her veins.

A court messenger stood rigidly in her doorway, clutching official documents—Richard had filed a lawsuit against her for withholding the inheritance from her late mother.

The legal terms were unambiguous. Without a formal will, Catherine's estate would be equally divided between surviving spouse and child.

Catherine, who'd never worked after marriage, left only one asset—a crumbling apartment frozen in time.

Though uninhabitable for years, the apartment remained Vivian's sanctuary, where she occasionally retreated to feel her mother's presence.

Now Richard was accusing her of hoarding the property, demanding compensation for lost inheritance and damages for its vacancy.

His ultimatum was clear—pay up or he'd force a sale. The derelict building's prime downtown location made it a developer's dream.

The amount he demanded was outrageous—nine hundred thousand sterlings.

Vivian's fingers turned bone-white around the papers as realization dawned—this was Richard's most brazen scheme yet.

She knew the apartment was merely a pretext. Something darker lurked beneath this legal maneuver.

Her phone vibrated with an unknown caller ID.

After three rings, she answered.

Richard's voice slithered through the receiver. "Received the court papers?"

Vivian didn't bother with pleasantries. "What game are you playing now?"

"You—" Richard's retort was cut off as Daphne's saccharine voice intervened. "Vivian darling, must we be so hostile? We're still family." Her tone dripped false concern. "I know that apartment is your mother's last gift to you. We'd never take it from you."

A calculated pause. "But we have... an alternative arrangement. Agree to our terms, and Richard will sign over his inheritance rights."

Vivian's jaw tightened. Daphne always played the benevolent stepmother while wielding poison-tipped words.

"What exactly do you want?" Vivian demanded.

Hearing no immediate refusal, Daphne pounced. "Remember Maxwell Sterling? Your former fiancé? He still carries a torch for you—marital status be damned." Her voice turned conspiratorial. "With your divorce from Adrian pending... perhaps reconsidering Maxwell wouldn't be so terrible?"

The chess pieces clicked into place. After all these years, they still sought to barter her like livestock.

###Chapter 102

A wave of rebellion coursed through Vivian as her fingers clenched around her phone, her voice turning icy. "That's not happening. This isn't the Middle Ages—you can't just auction me off like some prized livestock!"

Richard Dawson snatched the phone from Daphne's grasp, his tone dripping with menace. "If you refuse Maxwell and won't settle the debt, I'll have that dump of an apartment demolished and turned into a parking lot!"

The words confirmed what Vivian already knew—whatever familial ties remained between them had long since dissolved into bitter animosity.

Slumping against the wall, Vivian drew her knees to her chest, resting her chin on them as she curled into herself like a wounded animal.

That crumbling apartment was her last sanctuary, the only place where fragments of Catherine's memory still lingered. No matter how dilapidated, it was the sole tangible piece of her mother she had left.

After steadying her breathing, Vivian responded with measured calm. "I'll have my attorney review your so-called 'offer' to determine a fair settlement. If you're not satisfied, take me to court. But mark my words—I won't be your bargaining chip anymore. Consider our business concluded."

She ended the call with finality before they could respond.

On the other end, Daphne and Richard exchanged stunned glances. Richard took a slow sip of his whiskey, forehead creased in thought. "Since when did she grow a backbone? She swore she'd leave that marriage penniless. Where's this sudden fortune coming from? And what do we tell the Sterlings?"

Daphne rolled her eyes as she perched on the armrest. "Honestly, Richard, must you overcomplicate everything? If she has the money, we'll get it eventually. If not, she's exactly where we want her. Besides, cash burns quickly—especially with that hospital bill looming over her head. One bad turn with that old woman's health, and our little songbird will come crawling back."

Vivian tried to stand, but her legs betrayed her, leaving her slumped on the floor in helpless frustration. The weight of her family's expectations pressed down like storm clouds, their shadows stretching endlessly no matter how fast she ran.

With trembling fingers, she recounted the situation to her attorney, who confirmed the nine hundred thousand sterling demand was legally enforceable.

Her advance payment from Ivory Phoenix Productions—eight hundred thousand sterling—had been a rare kindness from Damien Vaughn, who'd taken pity on her post-divorce situation. Asking for more would risk appearing ungrateful.

Borrowing crossed her mind, but Audrey was embroiled in her own family crisis. There was no one else to turn to.

After a long moment of contemplation, Vivian squared her shoulders. If no one would help her, she'd help herself.

Changing into her most confident outfit—a tailored blazer and heels that clicked like armor—she marched to the bank. Within hours, she'd secured a line of credit, withdrawn the remaining funds, and combined them with her advance.

The moment the transaction cleared, she called her attorney. "Transfer the title immediately. I want this done before they can change their minds."

Her voice didn't waver, but her knuckles turned white around the phone.

This was war.

And for the first time, Vivian Hartley was fighting back.
###Chapter 103

The paperwork went smoother than Vivian expected. Richard, perhaps sensing her desperation, didn't make any unnecessary comments as he signed the documents with brisk efficiency. But it wasn't until the property deed with her name officially printed in bold letters landed in her trembling hands that Vivian finally exhaled the breath she'd been holding.

Life had a cruel habit of testing her limits. Just as she was turning the key in her apartment lock, her phone blared with the hospital's caller ID - the one treating Eleanor.

"Ms. Hartley, your grandmother's condition has taken a turn for the worse." The clinical voice on the other end made her stomach drop. "We're moving her to intensive care immediately and adjusting her treatment plan. This will unfortunately require additional funding. Could you come in today to discuss the financial arrangements?"

The news hit like a physical blow. No matter how hard she ran, life always seemed to outpace her. Vivian changed clothes in record time, her fingers fumbling with buttons as she rushed out the door.

The sight that greeted her at the hospital made her throat constrict. Eleanor looked so small in the sterile white bed, swallowed by tubes and wires, the rhythmic beeping of monitors the only sign of life. This woman had raised her after her parents' accident, had been her rock through every storm. Memories flashed before her eyes - sticky fingers clutching melting ice cream cones, childish promises whispered between giggles.

"I'll take you everywhere when I grow up, Grandma! Fancy restaurants and beaches with white sand!" Little Vivian had declared with all the certainty of youth.

Now those promises felt like ashes in her mouth as she gazed at the frail figure before her. The strong hands that had once held hers so securely now looked skeletal, the skin translucent with age and illness. A network of bruises and needle marks decorated the paper-thin skin.

"Grandma?" Vivian forced brightness into her voice as she stepped inside, pushing down the lump in her throat.

Eleanor's eyes lit up despite the pain. "My darling girl! Don't look so worried - these old bones just need some extra care."

Vivian grasped her grandmother's hand gently, tears threatening to spill. The veins stood out like blue rivers under parchment, each puncture mark a battle scar in Eleanor's war against time.

"Don't cry, sweetheart," Eleanor murmured, her voice weaker than Vivian had ever heard it. "You've grown into such a strong woman. I know you'll be fine, even when I'm not here to see it."

"I'm hiring the best specialists," Vivian vowed, her voice cracking. "And when you're better, we're taking that Mediterranean cruise you always wanted." The words tasted bitter - equal parts promise and desperate prayer.

Eleanor gave a faint smile, her eyes shining with love. "I'll hold you to that, my dear."

Their moment was interrupted by the doctor clearing his throat in the doorway. "Ms. Hartley, if we could discuss the treatment adjustments? The patient needs her rest."

Vivian hesitated, unwilling to leave. "I should go, Grandma. Work is... complicated right now." The understatement of the century. "But I'll be back as soon as I can."

"Go, darling," Eleanor whispered, patting her hand. "Take care of yourself too. I'm in good hands here."

Vivian pressed a kiss to her grandmother's forehead before following the doctor out, her heart heavier than it had ever been. The fluorescent lights of the hallway seemed to mock her with their sterile brightness as she prepared to hear how much more her grandmother's life would cost.
###Chapter 104

Vivian cast one last lingering glance at Eleanor before stepping out of the hospital room, following Dr. Harrison down the sterile hallway.

Her fingers twisted nervously around her purse strap as she entered his office. "Doctor," she began with visible hesitation, "would it be possible to extend the payment deadline by just a few days? My paycheck clears this Friday."

Dr. Harrison's brow furrowed as he adjusted his glasses. "Ms. Hartley, while I sympathize with your situation, this isn't a charity hospital."

"The treatments we're providing are cutting-edge and expensive. We simply can't operate on delayed payments."

Their conversation was abruptly cut short by an all-too-familiar voice from the doorway. "Vivian? What a coincidence seeing you here."

Vivian spun around to face Richard and Daphne standing in the threshold like unwelcome specters. Her body tensed as she took a protective step forward. "How did you find this place?" she demanded, her voice sharp as broken glass.

Years ago, Vivian had lived in constant fear that Richard might use Eleanor as leverage against her. She'd secretly arranged with Adrian to transfer her grandmother to this undisclosed medical facility. For two blissful years, the Dawsons had remained oblivious to Eleanor's whereabouts - until now. Their sudden appearance sent icy tendrils of dread coiling through her stomach.

Daphne offered a saccharine smile that didn't reach her cold eyes. "We came to visit your dear grandmother, of course. We even brought her fresh peaches yesterday."

The pieces clicked together in Vivian's mind - Eleanor's unusual quietness earlier, the way she'd avoided mentioning Adrian entirely. Now she understood. These vipers had undoubtedly revealed her impending divorce, sending Eleanor into distress that worsened her fragile condition.

Vivian's hands clenched into fists at her sides. "Stay away from my grandmother," she hissed, green eyes blazing. "If anything happens to her, I swear I'll drag you both down with me. I have nothing left to lose."

Richard barked out a humorless laugh. "Is that any way to speak to your father? You sound like some back-alley criminal."

Daphne placed a restraining hand on Richard's arm before stepping forward. "Darling, what a terrible thing to suggest! Your father cares for Eleanor deeply." Her gaze flicked meaningfully to Dr. Harrison. "We couldn't help overhearing about your... financial difficulties. Why didn't you come to us?"

"I have everything under control," Vivian said through gritted teeth, gesturing toward the door. "Now if you'll excuse us-"

Richard's voice turned dangerously smooth. "Such devotion to your grandmother. Pity if she suffered because you couldn't pay her medical bills."

"Don't let pride cloud your judgment, dear," Daphne purred, moving closer. "We come bearing good news. Maxwell has offered to cover all expenses. His uncle isn't just any doctor - he's a renowned specialist in geriatric care. This could be Eleanor's best chance."

Vivian's blood ran cold as she recognized the trap being laid before her. The walls seemed to close in as she realized how thoroughly they'd cornered her.
###Chapter 105

Vivian saw through their scheme instantly. They had come fully prepared. Eleanor's chronic illness was complicated by her delicate condition that ruled out surgery, leaving only medicinal treatments as an option. After consulting numerous specialists, doctors from both Crestwood and Frostholm had suggested Vivian explore alternative therapies. A master practitioner in traditional medicine might hold the key to her grandmother's recovery.

She had already sought out several renowned healers, but none had produced noticeable improvements. Now this couple was attempting to manipulate her into an alliance with the Sterling family. Vivian knew with absolute certainty that if Eleanor discovered her granddaughter was considering marriage to secure a physician, she would refuse treatment outright.

With this realization burning in her chest, Vivian stood her ground. "Grandmother and I don't need the Sterlings' help."

Faced with her defiance, Richard couldn't mask his irritation. "You're already a divorced woman. You're not some innocent maiden anymore. What's the harm in remarrying?"

Disbelief flashed across Vivian's face as she stared at the man who was supposed to be her father. The words cut deeper because they sounded nothing like the father she remembered. This was the final straw. Years of suppressed anguish erupted within her. In one fluid motion, Vivian hurled her phone directly at Richard's face and screamed, "Get out! You disgusting pig!"

Richard clutched his swelling eye, his features contorted in pain. His hand shot up, poised to strike. "You ungrateful brat! How dare you attack your own father!"

Blinded by rage, Vivian moved too slowly to avoid the incoming slap that connected sharply with her cheek. Her vision swam momentarily as she stumbled back, nearly losing her balance.

When Richard raised his hand for another blow, a tall figure materialized between them, shielding Vivian with protective urgency. Straightening her disheveled hair, Vivian looked up to see Ethan standing there. Towering over Richard, Ethan radiated quiet authority, the kind honed through years at Adrian's side.

His voice was glacial steel. "Mr. Dawson, I'd reconsider your actions carefully. Remember, Mrs. Blackwood remains under the Blackwood family's protection."

Richard, ever the coward when confronted with equal force, lowered his hand reluctantly, muttering, "No one tells me how to discipline my own daughter."

Ethan ignored the grumbling and gently guided Vivian to a nearby chair. "Mrs. Blackwood, are you hurt?"

His voice softened as he studied her, eyes reflecting genuine concern. Vivian, trapped in this web of familial cruelty, seemed even more vulnerable under his careful gaze.

The security team closed ranks around Daphne and Richard. Sensing the escalating tension, Daphne quickly ushered her husband away in humiliating retreat.

Dabbing at her stinging cheek, Vivian looked up at Ethan with shimmering eyes. "Why are you here?"

"Let me handle Eleanor's medical expenses," Ethan offered without preamble. "Mrs. Blackwood, Mr. Blackwood has already transferred eight hundred thousand to cover the next three months' treatments."

This shouldn't have surprised her. Adrian had arranged the hospital admission—of course he'd be monitoring everything.
###Chapter 106

Vivian pressed her lips into a thin line, fingers trembling as they covered her face. The way Adrian always threw money at problems made her blood boil—as if every issue could be silenced with the swipe of a pen.

If Richard hadn't exploded earlier, she might have stood her ground against Ethan's offer. But now? That ship had sailed.

Ethan picked up an ice pack from the nurse's station, his voice softening. "Mrs. Blackwood, shall I drive you back to Seabreeze Villa?"

She accepted the cold compress gratefully, pressing it to her burning cheeks. The chill grounded her, tempering the firestorm inside.

"Is he there?" The question slipped out before she could stop it. Despite everything, she missed Adrian's presence. Even his cold glares and cutting remarks were preferable to this hollow absence—especially when he'd always known how to fix her messes.

Ethan's arrival had felt like a lifeline moments ago. Now the rope was fraying.

"Mr. Blackwood is still at the office," Ethan hesitated. "Working late."

Adrian had deliberately avoided the hospital, unwilling to risk another confrontation with Vivian in front of Eleanor. Sending Ethan had been his coward's compromise.

Mid-explanation, a team of doctors hurried toward them.

"Mr. Caldwell!" The lead physician brightened. "Here for Ms. Whitmore's follow-up?"

Vivian's stomach dropped. So Adrian's late nights were spent with Serena. Ethan wasn't here for her at all—just facilitating another woman's care. That fleeting hope? A lighthouse beam meant for someone else's shore.

Before Ethan could respond, Vivian thrust the ice pack back at him. "Thank your boss for me. I'll settle today's bill personally."

Ethan shook his head sharply at the doctors. "Wrong patient." Turning back to Vivian, he reached out. "Mrs. Blackwood, I'm not here for—"

She forced a brittle smile. "Just deliver the message." No explanation could undo this. After years as Adrian's shadow, Ethan would defend him to the grave.

Her heels clicked faster down the corridor, each step putting distance between her and their pitying stares. The renowned Crestwood Medical Center—Adrian's pet project with its elite specialists and marble halls—had always been his domain. Even the chief surgeon was his personal physician.

Now it was just another stage for her humiliation.

Ethan watched her retreat, frustration creasing his brow. This misunderstanding would only widen the chasm between them. His phone buzzed—Adrian calling. Again.
###Chapter 107

Ethan hesitated before answering the vibrating phone.

Adrian's baritone voice resonated through the receiver. "Is everything taken care of?"

A cold shiver ran down Ethan's spine as he wiped his damp palms on his trousers. "Mrs. Hartley sent her gratitude through me," he replied carefully.

On the other end, Adrian's jaw tightened visibly. "And? I specifically asked for her return to Seabreeze Villa. What was her response? I couldn't care less about her pride, but Eleanor shouldn't suffer because of it."

"Mrs. Hartley has been discharged from the hospital." Ethan inhaled sharply before continuing, "She promised to repay all medical expenses as soon as possible."

The faint amusement that had been playing on Adrian's lips vanished instantly, replaced by stunned silence. With a frustrated growl, he hurled his phone onto the leather couch.

Vivian's behavior was becoming increasingly incomprehensible. After going out of his way to help, this was the thanks he got?

His fingers raked through his dark hair as he paced the study. He'd always tried to understand her perspective, to make allowances for her difficult past. But wasn't it time she moved past old grudges?

Knowing how much Vivian adored Eleanor, he'd treated the elderly woman like family. Aware of Vivian's financial struggles, he'd personally instructed Ethan to monitor Eleanor's medical situation - which had revealed Vivian's inability to cover the hospital bills.

What shocked Adrian most was Vivian's stubborn refusal to accept help, even with Eleanor's wellbeing at stake.

Meanwhile, Vivian trudged toward her apartment building, her shoulders slumped under the weight of exhaustion. All she wanted was the sanctuary of her quiet apartment where she could finally break down.

As the elevator doors opened, she nearly collided with Lydia, who was heading out for a late-night snack.

"Vivian?" Lydia's cheerful greeting died on her lips when she noticed the red-rimmed eyes. She rushed forward, concern etching her features. "What happened? Are you okay?"

"Nothing," Vivian mumbled, attempting to brush past with downcast eyes.

Lydia hesitated in the hallway, biting her lip. After a moment, she called out tentatively, "Vivian... is this about that night at Whispering Skies? When I insisted you have that drink?"

Since Vivian's return to rebuild her career, there'd been an unspoken tension between them. Lydia wondered if that ill-fated evening had damaged their friendship beyond repair.

Gently touching Vivian's arm, Lydia continued, "I only suggested drinking because I thought it would deter unwanted attention."

Vivian stopped abruptly, turning with sudden realization. "Lydia, I don't blame you for that night at all," she said earnestly. "You've been my rock since I came back. I could never repay your kindness."

The weight of unspoken words hung between them as Vivian finally allowed herself to be pulled into a comforting embrace. For the first time in weeks, she didn't feel quite so alone.
###Chapter 108

Vivian had mastered the art of concealing her emotions so thoroughly that even Lydia, her dearest confidante, remained unaware of the storm raging within her.

Her fingers hovered over the apartment keypad. At the last second, she turned to face Lydia with hesitant eyes. "Would you... come in for coffee?" The unspoken plea in her voice was unmistakable.

Their eyes met, and in that silent exchange, years of unspoken tensions dissolved. Lydia crossed the threshold, her tone firm yet gentle. "No more walls between us. Whatever comes, we face it together. Promise me?"

Perched on the edge of her velvet sofa, Vivian unraveled the tangled web surrounding Eleanor. When Adrian's name surfaced, she hastily labeled him "just an acquaintance." Her fingers wrestled with a stubborn water bottle cap before she sighed. "I need to repay this... acquaintance. The debt's become this awkward barrier between us."

Lydia's brow furrowed in thought. "My recent property investment has me cash-strapped..." Suddenly, she snapped her fingers. "Wait! Ivory Phoenix Productions is scrambling for ghostwriters. Their client's impossible to please, but the pay's spectacular. Maybe your solution?"

With practiced ease, Lydia pulled up the production company's sleek website and the head developer's LinkedIn profile. Vivian studied the screen, nodding slowly. "This could work."

"They're new but well-funded," Lydia confirmed, exhaling a thin stream of smoke. "The owner's an old contact. They haven't attracted A-list writers yet, but their compensation packages are generous."

Vivian's lips pressed into a tight line. Noticing her hesitation, Lydia tapped her cigarette against a crystal ashtray. "Let me guess - you're protective of your Vivian Hartley byline. Not keen on cheapening it for quick cash?"

"Here's the play," Lydia continued, crossing her legs. "Create a fresh alias. I'll get you an audition script. The rate won't match your usual, but it'll cover your immediate needs."

Relief washed over Vivian's features. "Lydia, I don't know how to thank you."

Within minutes, a new WhatsApp account materialized. Lydia waved away the gratitude. "Please, you're not just my writer - you're family. Besides," she added with a wink, "if financial stress delays our shoot, we both lose. These scripts are formulaic - more product than art. With your talent? Child's play."

True to her word, Lydia forwarded Vivian's contact to Ivory Phoenix. Within the hour, sample materials arrived with surprising instructions: "Study Vivian Hartley's style - our client adores her work." The irony wasn't lost on either woman.

As Lydia gathered her things, she shot Vivian a look. "Dive into those samples. My phone's always on."

"Will do," Vivian replied, already reaching for her laptop.

The soft click of the door marked the beginning of a new chapter.
###Chapter 109

With Lydia out of sight, Vivian turned her full attention to crafting the sample screenplay. The story unfolded as a modern love story, a genre she could write in her sleep. Yet the female lead bore an uncanny resemblance to Serena—all angelic smiles masking a viper's cunning. Vivian couldn't fathom why such characters were suddenly in vogue among producers.

Had this been under her Katrina pseudonym days, she'd have rejected the project outright, even for a hundred million. But with bills piling up, she swallowed her pride and tailored the script to their exact specifications.

Ivory Phoenix Productions reviewed the draft with palpable excitement. "Brilliant work," the executive said, fingers steepled. "We'll pay a million for this. Though we don't usually charge hefty commissions..."

"Then we're agreed," Vivian cut in. "But I require sixty percent upfront. My situation is... pressing. If that's unacceptable, I'll take this elsewhere."

Meanwhile at the production office, the CEO was weighing Vivian's terms when a voice startled him. "Working late again?"

He looked up to find Serena Whitmore framed in the doorway, designer shopping bags dangling from both arms. Oversized Chanel sunglasses obscured half her face, but the downward tilt of her glossed lips spoke volumes.

"Your visits always extend my workday," he quipped, hastily relieving her of the bags. "To what do I owe the pleasure?"

Serena glided to his desk, settling into the leather chair with practiced grace. Removing her sunglasses, she tapped manicured nails against the mahogany surface. "Just passing through the neighborhood."

Her expression hardened. "About that script I requested? It's been seven days with zero updates."

Her social media metrics were hemorrhaging followers. She needed a knockout script—one with a protagonist mirroring her own carefully cultivated image—to salvage her crumbling reputation. Established writers refused such transparent vanity projects, forcing her to this fledgling studio desperate for A-list clients.

"Your project is our top priority," the CEO soothed, handing her a crystal glass of sparkling water before pulling up a file. "But look what I found—a fresh talent whose writing rivals Katrina's golden era. Given time, she'll be unstoppable."

Serena's skeptical gaze flickered across the screen. By the final page, her shoulders relaxed. "This... is shockingly good. Miles above that Blazing Horizon trainwreck I'm stuck in." She leaned forward, eyes gleaming. "Sign her immediately. The industry's drowning in garbage scripts—I need material like this for my rebrand."

The CEO hesitated. "There's a complication. She's demanding sixty percent upfront due to... financial constraints."

Serena rolled her kohl-rimmed eyes. "Just pay the woman. Real talent's rarer than ethical producers in this town—why are we even discussing this?"

Her diamond bracelet clinked against the desk as she reached for her phone. "Transfer the advance from my account if you must. I want this script locked down before sunrise."

Outside, the city lights twinkled like scattered diamonds as Vivian's phone chimed with an incoming wire notification. The numbers made her breath catch. Enough to cover three months of Richard's medical bills.

She saved the transaction receipt as Serena's latest Instagram post loaded—a pouty selfie captioned "Found my next iconic role ✨". Vivian's lips twisted. Little did the star know she'd just bankrolled her own carefully crafted downfall.

The real performance was only beginning.
###Chapter 110

The script company owner forced a tight-lipped smile, his fingers nervously tapping the desk. "It's... complicated. Our production house hasn't secured many projects lately. The upfront payment is proving difficult."

Vivian's phone vibrated with a bank notification showing her modest balance. Most of her wealth was tied in long-term investments, leaving little liquid cash. Biting her lip, she quickly typed a message to Adrian on WhatsApp.

"Adrian, I've found an extraordinary screenplay. The writer demands sixty percent advance."

Within seconds, three dots appeared. "Amount?"

"Six hundred thousand sterling."

Vivian wasn't concerned about the inflated price. Her ambitions stretched far beyond petty cash transactions. Becoming Mrs. Blackwood was the real prize.

Meanwhile, Serena paced her penthouse, checking her watch every thirty seconds. Just as she decided to abandon the deal, her phone pinged with a contract attachment.

"Review and sign. Funds will transfer immediately upon execution," the producer's message read.

Serena scanned the digital document with lawyer-like precision. Satisfied, she scribbled her signature with a stylus. The payment notification arrived before she could lock her phone. Without hesitation, she forwarded the entire sum to Adrian's offshore account.

At Seabreeze Villa, Adrian frowned at his banking app. Two identical transactions appeared simultaneously - one outgoing, one incoming. His knuckles whitened as he gripped the phone.

"Odd coincidence," he muttered, though his instincts screamed otherwise. The timing was too perfect. Vivian pleading with doctors about medical bills hours ago, now suddenly possessing six hundred thousand sterling?

Ethan extended a cordless phone. "Perhaps you should inform Mrs. Blackwood about the transfer?"

Adrian's laugh held no humor. "Since when do I personally confirm six-figure transactions?" Billion-dollar deals rarely warranted his direct attention.

Yet his gaze kept returning to those mirrored transactions. The numbers taunted him, whispering of hidden connections between two women who should have no ties.

Ethan remained statue-still, the phone still offered like a peace offering. The grandfather clock's ticking filled the heavy silence.

Adrian's jaw tightened. Somewhere in these numbers lay a truth he couldn't yet see - a truth that might unravel everything.
###Chapter 111

"Mrs. Blackwood isn't exactly rolling in wealth, yet she managed to send such a substantial sum. That's certainly worth discussing, Mr. Blackwood."

"Absolutely worth discussing, if only to ensure she didn't borrow it from those questionable acquaintances of hers." Adrian's eyes darkened with a flicker of disdain. "I have my own phone."

Vivian had already erased his contact from her checklist, eliminating any need to borrow Ethan's device. He retrieved his phone and dialed her number.

The moment the call connected, Vivian's icy tone cut through like a winter gale. "I've reimbursed you for Grandma's medical expenses. We're even now. Though I do appreciate your help."

Her words ignited a spark of irritation in Adrian. He'd been prepared to suggest she keep the money if finances were tight, but her tone made him reconsider.

With barely concealed annoyance, he countered, "What exactly do you mean by 'we're even now'?"

He'd offered assistance genuinely, believing it his duty as a responsible husband, yet her apparent ingratitude stung.

Though vexed by Adrian's tone, Vivian acknowledged her debt in this instance. She restrained her frustration and clarified patiently, "Since I've left the Blackwood family, it wouldn't be proper to continue using your funds."

Adrian didn't accept this as clarification - he took it as provocation. With biting sarcasm, he pressed further. "So you're severing all connections with me? Do you truly believe this paltry sum settles everything between us?"

"The six hundred thousand merely covered Grandma's medical bills. As for the rest, I left twenty million at Seabreeze Villa when I departed. That money was rightfully mine. I believe that more than compensates for any expenses incurred during my two years with the Blackwoods. Moreover, I took none of the lavish jewelry or status symbols from the estate."

Vivian's voice carried quiet triumph; she spoke with unshakable conviction.

Leaving with both her dignity and financial independence felt profoundly correct. A woman needed her own resources, after all.

Adrian rose, his expression inscrutable as he gazed through the window. Throughout his career, he'd dealt with countless individuals seeking to extract additional benefits. Money had always been his solution to problems, yet Vivian presented an unexpected anomaly.

The funds he'd offered carried his genuine concern, not mere transactional value. After a prolonged silence, his deep voice finally resonated through the phone. "Vivian, have you no compassion whatsoever? What does that twenty million signify? In two years of marriage, has it truly all been reduced to financial calculations?"

Vivian's bitter laugh came swift and sharp. "Besides money, what else remains between us to divide?"

Had anyone else made such a remark, she might have interpreted it as sentimental. Coming from Adrian, it only bred confusion. Their home had never echoed with children's laughter or even pet footsteps. Emotionally, she'd poured her heart into this union tirelessly, receiving nothing in return. She'd never sought compensation for emotional labor - how dare he pose such a question now?

Adrian's silence stretched endlessly across the connection.

###Chapter 112

"Mr. Blackwood, has it suddenly occurred to you that you're in love with me?" Vivian's voice dripped with biting sarcasm, meant to wound, yet it left an unexpected emptiness in her chest.

Adrian immediately recognized the venom in her tone. His response came cold and detached. "Fall for an ungrateful woman like you? Never."

Getting exactly the reaction she'd anticipated, Vivian abruptly ended the call. Her lips curled into a bitter smirk as she mockingly toasted the silent phone. Tossing it onto the couch, she decided a grocery run was overdue—her pantry needed restocking far more than her heart needed to dwell on a failing marriage to a man who'd become a stranger.

Outside Cascade Residences, a Ferrari glistened in the afternoon light, parked with the casual arrogance of ownership. Dominic stepped out, followed by an energetic teenage girl bursting from the passenger seat. She tilted her face upward, eyes sparkling with excitement as she gestured toward the luxury apartments.

"This is perfect!" she exclaimed. "Right in the city center, just blocks from my school! You won't have to worry about me at all. Once I move in, I promise I'll focus on studying—"

The girl was technically Dominic's cousin, sent by his mother after protesting dorm life. Dominic had been roped into apartment hunting—a task he found mildly tedious.

"I'm not holding my breath for your academic dedication," Dominic replied absently, his gaze drifting across the neighborhood. The area did seem pleasant enough.

Then a familiar figure caught his eye. His cousin continued chattering.

"Dominic, this place was recommended by my classmate! She knows all the celebrity hotspots, and I've heard several stars live here—" She paused, noticing his distraction. "Hello? Earth to Dominic? What's so interesting?"

Following his gaze, she spotted the object of his attention. Among the crowd stood an elegant woman in simple white tee and shorts that somehow looked designer on her frame. Her hair was loosely tied back, revealing the graceful curve of her neck, her serene face holding an untouchable beauty like moonlight.

The girl nudged Dominic with a knowing grin. "So that's your type? Not bad, cousin!"

Dominic pulled her closer with a warning hiss. "Shut it. She's married."

Her eyes widened dramatically as she covered her mouth. "Dominic! Crushing on a married woman? That's scandalous!"

But Dominic wasn't listening. He watched intently as Vivian swiped her access card—she lived here.

In one swift motion, he transferred five thousand sterling to his cousin. "Go shopping with your friends," he said distractedly, "but no clubs. I've got urgent business."

She blinked at the notification, grinning. "Wow, big spender! Fine, I'll let you off the hook. Go chase your forbidden romance—my lips are sealed!"

Ignoring her commentary, Dominic immediately dialed Adrian. "I've found where your wife is staying!" he announced.
###Chapter 113

Adrian's response was infuriatingly nonchalant. "Dull."

Dominic hurriedly spilled the details, fearing Adrian might disconnect. "You'll regret skipping this—it's adjacent to the vibrant downtown financial district, at Cascade Residences."

Cascade Residences—a name entirely unfamiliar compared to what Vivian had previously mentioned.

Adrian's finger hesitated briefly over the end-call button before he reconsidered. "I'm coming," he stated.

Thirty minutes later, a discreet Audi pulled up beside Dominic's flashy Ferrari.

Dominic's gaze flickered over, curiosity etching his features as Ethan emerged from the driver's seat to open the rear door.

Jogging closer, Dominic tapped the car roof with a smirk. "Adrian, swapping your luxury fleet for this relic? What's the story?"

Adrian stepped out, his expression icy, and strode past Dominic without acknowledgment.

Ethan explained calmly, "Mr. Blackwood's vehicle was undergoing maintenance when you called. Since mine was available at the office, I drove it here."

Adrian shot Ethan a frosty glare. "Since when did you become so chatty?"

Dominic was visibly taken aback. Normally, Adrian's cars received priority service—no queues, just a swift hour or two for routine checks. He'd never rushed before, not even for multimillion-dollar deals. Yet today, his impatience was palpable.

Could this mean he actually cared about Vivian?

Everyone had assumed Adrian's marriage to Vivian was a reckless act of defiance—a middle finger to his family after seizing control, a rebellion against being torn apart from Serena. To the world, Vivian was a modern-day Cinderella, stumbling into opulence and the life of a trophy wife. People believed she worshipped Adrian, though she seemed little more than a glorified maid in their mansion.

No one expected her to claim her independence. They'd all anticipated she'd wait passively until Adrian grew bored and replaced her with a socialite of his caliber. Yet against all odds, she did assert herself—not only walking away empty-handed but leaving twenty million Sterlings behind for Adrian.

Despite his usual detachment, Adrian wasn't ready to let her go and finalize their divorce.

Had their relationship been so grossly misunderstood? Perhaps even Adrian himself hadn't fully recognized his own evolving feelings.

Dominic's lips curled into a knowing smile, a glint of private victory in his eyes, as if he alone held the truth amidst universal ignorance. Once the conversation seemed concluded, Ethan didn't linger; he started the car and drove off promptly.

Scanning the surroundings, Adrian recognized the vicinity—near the neighborhood he'd once visited to fetch Vivian. He hadn't expected her to be this cautious, to mislead him with a decoy address. The realization pricked him.

They were still husband and wife. He'd always considered himself a dutiful partner—no scandals, unwavering financial support. Why then did she harbor such deep resentment? True, his work often consumed him, possibly neglecting some of her needs, but a simple conversation could have bridged that gap. Now she was demanding a complete separation, secretly leasing a new place to escape their shared history.
###Chapter 114

Adrian's jaw tightened as his thoughts spiraled into darker territories. His voice cut through the air like shards of ice. "Where's Vivian?"

Dominic arched an eyebrow, a smug grin playing on his lips. "Her new apartment. I managed to track down the address." He leaned closer with theatrical flair. "Have you seen her lately? She's practically glowing - like someone finally watered that wilting flower properly."

He snapped his fingers suddenly, eyes lighting up. "That's it! She used to be like some timid little church mouse, but now?" Dominic whistled low. "Full-blown peony in bloom. Vibrant. Dazzling. Makes you wonder what changed, doesn't it?"

Adrian's expression darkened dangerously. "Are you implying I was the one making her wilt?"

Dominic's grin vanished as he realized his misstep. Without another word, he turned sharply and led the way down the marble corridor.

The silence between them stretched for three full blocks before Dominic suddenly pivoted, blocking Adrian's path. All traces of humor had vanished from his face. "Answer me honestly, Adrian. Do you love Vivian?"

Adrian's fingers twitched at his sides. "She's my wife. I provide everything required of that position."

Dominic exhaled sharply through his nose. "Cut the corporate speak. I'm not asking about obligations or titles." He tapped his chest. "I'm asking about here. Do you feel anything for her?"

The question hung between them like an executioner's axe.

Adrian's piercing gaze locked onto Dominic, so intense it made the other man's palms dampen. That stare reminded Dominic uncomfortably of Vivian's probing questions during their last phone call.

Abruptly, Adrian looked away, his lip curling in disdain. "Perhaps you should focus on finding gainful employment rather than meddling in my marriage," he drawled, brushing past Dominic.

His voice carried down the empty street. "The marriage contract binds us. That's the only reality that matters. Love?" A derisive snort. "I give her designer clothes, a penthouse, security. Those are tangible. Emotions are fleeting."

Dominic jogged to catch up, analyzing his friend's rigid posture. "You've given Serena everything too - designer wardrobes, vacations, whatever her heart desires. Yet that's always felt more... sisterly." He risked a sideways glance. "But with Vivian? You're all fire and storms. That temper of yours betrays something deeper. Maybe you don't love her, but she gets under your skin like no other woman ever has."

Adrian's step faltered almost imperceptibly. His fingers fumbled with his platinum cufflinks. "Get to your point, Dominic."

Dominic grabbed his arm, forcing him to stop. "My point is Vivian wants a divorce because she thinks you don't care. And you're standing here arguing semantics instead of telling me I'm wrong." His voice dropped. "So tell me, Adrian. Am I wrong?"
###Chapter 115

The tension between us was palpable as Dominic leaned closer, his voice dropping to a hushed urgency. "If you genuinely want to save your marriage, Adrian, you must learn to show vulnerability. Love isn't measured by the price tags on your gifts." His fingers tapped restlessly against the polished mahogany table. "It's about the unspoken moments—the shared glances, the whispered confessions in the dark."

Adrian Blackwood's jaw tightened, his stormy gray eyes reflecting inner turmoil. Every word made logical sense, yet strung together, they formed a language foreign to him. The younger Adrian would have scoffed at such sentimental notions. But Vivian's recent behavior—her cold silences, the way she flinched at his touch—forced him to reconsider.

"What exactly constitutes love?" Adrian's voice was rougher than intended. "It's an abstract concept with no tangible value. Are empty promises truly superior to financial security?" The question of whether he loved Vivian had never consciously occurred to him. The Blackwood dynasty operated on different currencies—power, influence, strategic alliances.

Among his social circle, relationships were carefully calculated exchanges—status for beauty, wealth for companionship. If this was love's true nature, Adrian wanted no part of it.

His union with Vivian had been accidental, yet strangely fitting. She was unpredictable—a tempest in human form—yet her presence never grated. Sometimes, when she laughed unexpectedly, he caught himself mirroring her smile. She was... acceptable. More than acceptable. The thought of her leaving over something as nebulous as "emotional neglect" struck him as absurd.

Dominic released a heavy sigh, recognizing the futility of his argument.

"You're too entrenched in your worldview," he said, draping an arm around Adrian's shoulders before remembering his friend's aversion to touch. Only three people had ever breached that barrier—Serena, Vivian, and his estranged sister.

As they approached the mixed-use high-rise, Adrian's nose wrinkled in distaste. "People actually live here? Above a shopping complex?"

"Don't judge prematurely," Dominic countered. "This is Cascade Residences—some of the tightest security in Crestwood."

Adrian arched a skeptical brow. "Then how did you bypass it so easily?"

Dominic smirked. "I have my ways. Besides, this neighborhood caters to elite professionals. Rumor has it several A-list celebrities own penthouses here."

"Celebrities?" Adrian scoffed. "What self-respecting public figure would choose this... urban monstrosity?"

The glass doors slid open, revealing a sleek marble lobby where their footsteps echoed ominously. Somewhere in this concrete labyrinth, Vivian waited—possibly packing her belongings, possibly already gone. The thought sent an unfamiliar pang through Adrian's chest.

Dominic pressed the elevator button with renewed determination. "Just tell her she matters. That's all it takes."

Adrian remained silent, staring at the ascending floor numbers as if they were counting down to his execution. The elevator dinged.

The doors opened.

And there she was.
###Chapter 116

"Lower your voice, Adrian," Dominic murmured, stepping closer. His breath tickled Adrian's ear. "If Vivian hears you, prepare for fireworks."

As he spoke, Dominic's eyes suddenly darted over Adrian's shoulder. "V-Vivian! What a surprise!" he stammered.

Adrian turned to see Vivian struggling under the weight of multiple packages - three overstuffed shopping bags and several cardboard boxes teetering in her arms. Her eyes widened comically at the sight of Adrian, shock freezing her in place.

Dominic greeted her with uncharacteristic enthusiasm, a side of him Vivian had never witnessed before.

Startled by his sudden energy, Vivian fumbled with her precarious load. The boxes tumbled to the ground with a crash, their contents scattering across the polished lobby floor. She shot Adrian a venomous glare before pointedly turning away from both men to gather her belongings.

Seizing the opportunity, Dominic grabbed Adrian's wrist. "Let us help you with that, Vivian," he insisted.

Dominic immediately knelt beside her, efficiently collecting the spilled items while Adrian remained stiff as a statue, his expression unreadable. One of the shopping bags had split open, its contents now impossible to repack neatly. The mess made it clear Vivian couldn't possibly manage alone.

From his towering height, Adrian's voice dripped with condescension. "Can't even handle basic errands. If you're incapable, why not use PrimeCart's delivery service like everyone else?"

Vivian kept her eyes trained on the floor, her voice steady but edged with steel. "Not all of us can afford to burn money like you, Mr. Blackwood. Some of us actually budget."

Dominic, sensing the rising tension, shoved a box into Adrian's hands. "Come on, help out."

He then scooped up most of the remaining packages himself, leaving only a few snack items behind. "Vivian, you take these. We'll carry the rest up for you."

Vivian stood abruptly, shaking her head. "That's very kind, but unnecessary. I'll have security assist me later."

Dominic clutched the box tighter, unwilling to relinquish it. "No need to bother them. We're free right now - might as well make ourselves useful." He nudged Adrian sharply with his elbow.

Adrian's eyes narrowed to icy slits. "Must you always create unnecessary work? People are paid to do their jobs, not cater to your whims. If everyone behaved like you, how would our service staff cope?"

Dominic opened his mouth but found no rebuttal, shaking his head in frustration at Adrian's stubbornness.

Too exhausted for further argument, Vivian stated bluntly, "Mr. Blackwood, after all your years in business, you still don't understand? Let me be perfectly clear - I don't want you in my apartment."

This direct challenge ignited Adrian's temper. "What are you afraid I'll see? The squalor you live in?" he sneered.

Vivian studied him silently - the sharp angles of his face, the commanding presence that naturally drew every eye in the room. All that magnetic appeal evaporated the moment he opened his mouth.

With a resigned sigh, Vivian realized Adrian was determined to invade her space today. She pressed the elevator button, then turned to Dominic with a polite nod. "Thank you," she murmured softly, pointedly ignoring Adrian as if he were invisible.
###Chapter 117

"Alright, Vivian," Dominic responded swiftly, nudging Adrian forward, the packages in his hands making their movement clumsy.

Initially, Dominic had perceived Vivian as a quiet, unassuming homemaker. But after multiple encounters, his opinion had transformed completely. Though usually soft-spoken and reserved, Vivian showed flashes of fiery determination that mirrored Adrian's own passionate nature.

It was impressive how well Vivian appeared to be thriving since her separation from Adrian, something Dominic found quite extraordinary.

The three entered the elevator, and as it rose, the air grew heavy with unspoken tension. The brief ascent stretched into what felt like an endless moment.

Dominic, typically the mediator, found himself powerless to bridge the frosty divide between them.

When the doors slid open, Dominic stepped out first, setting down the items with practiced efficiency. Checking his phone, his face lit up at an urgent notification. "Adrian, Vivian, something's come up. I need to leave. You two carry on."

With that, he pressed the elevator button and disappeared behind closing doors.

Left alone in the corridor, Vivian and Adrian stood meters apart, deliberately avoiding eye contact. They faced opposite directions, the space between them crackling with uncomfortable energy neither wished to acknowledge.

Exiting the elevator and unlocking her apartment door, Vivian hesitated slightly, moving aside to create space. "Thanks. Just leave them by the entrance," she directed, her tone courteous yet detached.

As she contemplated how to politely suggest Adrian's departure, he had already deposited the packages and made himself comfortable on the sofa. Glancing back at her lingering near the doorway, he remarked casually, "I'm parched."

His voice carried a note of expectation as he added, "After all my efforts today, you wouldn't deny me a drink, would you?"

Her expression frosty, Vivian slowly closed the door and moved toward the kitchen, intending to boil water. But her hand paused mid-air above the kettle. A realization struck - she owed him nothing. On days when cramps wracked her body, she didn't even indulge in warm drinks for herself. Why should she extend this courtesy to what was essentially a stranger now?

Changing course, she turned and retrieved a glass and bottled water from the fridge. Approaching Adrian, she extended the chilled water with visible reluctance.

He frowned, making no move to accept it. "Cold drinks don't agree with me," he complained.

Vivian's shoulders lifted in an indifferent shrug. "That's all I'm offering," she countered, impatience coloring her tone.

This sudden pickiness contrasted sharply with the man who used to thrive on iced coffee during marathon work sessions. Vivian's well-meaning reminders about his health had only ever irritated him.

His gaze fixed on the glass in her hand, Adrian spoke with playful lightness. "I believe I'll take that one instead."
###Chapter 118

Vivian refused to humor his antics, flinging the water bottle toward Adrian before popping open her own soda with a satisfying hiss.

She took a slow, deliberate sip, her lips curling into a mischievous smile. "This cheap soda is far beneath your refined palate, Mr. Blackwood."

Adrian found himself unusually speechless, a faint flush creeping up his neck as he recalled his own mocking comments about Julian's beverage choices. Vivian's eyes sparkled with triumph, thoroughly enjoying his discomfort.

A deafening crack of thunder shattered the moment, followed by a brilliant flash of lightning that illuminated the rapidly darkening sky. The sudden storm startled Vivian, giving Adrian the perfect opportunity to swipe her soda can. His fingers brushed against the faint lipstick mark where her lips had touched the rim. When he drank from the same spot, the memory of her soft lips sent an unexpected jolt through him.

By the time Vivian recovered, Adrian was already smirking, tilting the nearly empty can in her direction. "Turns out stepping out of my comfort zone wasn't so terrible after all."

"Pathetic," she scoffed, rolling her eyes dramatically. Pulling out her phone, she decided it was time to end this charade. "I'm calling Ethan to come collect his wayward boss."

Adrian's expression darkened as she dialed, her voice sharp against the sound of pounding rain. "There's a storm raging outside. Would you mind retrieving your employer?"

Ethan's response came through with surprising hesitation. "My apologies, Mrs. Blackwood, but I'm currently occupied." Since Vivian was standing close, Adrian overheard every word. He settled deeper into the couch cushions, taking another leisurely sip with an air of satisfaction.

Vivian shot Adrian a suspicious glance before pressing the phone closer to her ear. "Surely there must be someone available? A driver? An assistant?"

"All vehicles are undergoing maintenance, and the staff has left for the evening," Ethan replied smoothly. The convenient excuse made Vivian's eyes narrow in disbelief, though she lacked the records to disprove his claim.

Retreating to the bathroom for privacy, she lowered her voice to a furious whisper. "If this is your attempt at matchmaking, it's wasted effort. His presence only causes more problems."

Ethan maintained his professional calm. "You're overthinking this, Mrs. Blackwood. I genuinely can't get away right now. Could you have him wait a bit longer? I'll be there as soon as possible."

"Your audacity is astounding," Vivian snapped before abruptly ending the call.

Returning to find Adrian sprawled comfortably on her sofa, she crossed her arms. "I'm tired of these games. Remember, this is a leased apartment. I can walk away anytime."

Adrian regarded her with genuine surprise. "You honestly believe I'd go through this much trouble just to follow you?" His baffled expression gave her pause.

Vivian studied him carefully, searching for deception but finding none. "So you're telling me this is all just... coincidence?"

He adjusted his position, his tone unexpectedly gentle. "Actually, I'm helping Dominic's cousin find an apartment. She's attending the international school nearby."
###Chapter 119

A flush of humiliation crept up Vivian's neck as she recognized she might have overestimated her importance in Adrian's world again. Wordlessly, she turned toward the hallway to organize the shopping bags she'd carried in earlier. Adrian, on his part, pulled out his phone and started attending to urgent emails.

They occupied opposite ends of the living room, wrapped in a silence that was both uncomfortable and strangely soothing. As Vivian sorted through her purchases, she momentarily forgot Adrian was even present.

There was something therapeutic about methodically stocking the pantry, each item finding its designated spot. After nearly forty minutes of organizing, her stomach growled loudly in protest.

Retrieving two packs of ramen from the freshly stocked shelves, she headed toward the kitchen. Just then, Adrian glanced up from his screen. "I haven't eaten either. Mind if I join you?"

Vivian ignored him and reached for a saucepan to boil water. His voice floated across the open space. "Easy on the spice, please."

Her kitchen had an open concept, and through the swirling steam, she could see Adrian lounging on the sofa, fingers dancing across his phone as he responded to messages. For one surreal moment, she felt dizzy with recognition. This was exactly the domestic scene she'd fantasized about during their marriage - sharing mundane moments while remaining connected across the room.

A bitter smile twisted her lips. The irony wasn't lost on her - experiencing her marital ideal on the verge of divorce.

Lost in thought, she reached for the heavy pot with one hand. The water level was higher than usual since she was cooking for two. The pot tilted precariously, sending a wave of scalding broth toward her bare feet. She jumped back, but not fast enough - the boiling liquid splashed across her left foot.

The skin turned an angry red instantly, the burn radiating sharp pain through her nerves. She couldn't suppress a soft whimper. "Ah!"

"What happened?" Adrian was already striding across the room before the words left his mouth, phone forgotten on the couch.

"N-nothing serious," she stammered, taking an awkward step backward. "Just spilled some hot water." She forced a casual tone, though her toes curled in pain.

Memories surfaced of how she used to dramatize minor discomforts just to earn his concern. The recollection made her cringe.

Adrian's gaze dropped to her reddening foot. He bent suddenly, one arm sliding behind her knees as if to carry her. "I can walk," Vivian insisted, stepping back so quickly she nearly stumbled. "Don't make a big deal out of it."

Adrian straightened but kept a steadying hand on her elbow, his voice laced with frustration. "When I don't notice your hints, you accuse me of indifference. When I try to help, you say I'm exaggerating. That's quite the contradiction, Vivian. What exactly do you want from me? Do you even know?"

She let him guide her to the sofa, her voice quiet but firm. "I know precisely what I want, Adrian. People evolve. There was a time I craved your affection and a happy home. You met that with detachment. Now I've realized I won't stay in this one-sided marriage any longer. And still, you're dissatisfied. First you claimed I asked for too much. Now you question if I know my own mind? Mr. Blackwood, perhaps the confusion lies with you. My desires have always been clear - first it was love and family. Now it's freedom."

Adrian had no interest in dissecting philosophical debates about relationships. Turning away with visible irritation, he muttered, "I never knew you had such a gift for rhetoric. You've certainly prepared quite the arsenal of arguments."
###Chapter 120

The afternoon sunlight streamed through the bay windows as Vivian sat stiffly on the velvet chaise lounge.

"People will fight tooth and nail to defend their position, especially when they're convinced of their righteousness," Vivian remarked with a tired sigh, her fingers absently twisting the damp tissue in her hands.

The emotional outburst had drained her more than she cared to admit. Arguments always left her feeling hollowed out, like a shell washed ashore by turbulent waves.

"That's not sterile," Adrian observed sharply, plucking the crumpled tissue from her grasp with surprising gentleness. His long fingers made quick work of disposing it before reaching past her for the first aid kit on the side table.

When he knelt before her, Vivian's breath hitched. His warm hands cradled her bare foot with unexpected reverence, sending an electric jolt up her spine. She instinctively tried to pull away - her feet had always been intensely private territory.

"Hold still," Adrian commanded softly, his grip firm yet tender as he applied the cooling ointment. The contrast between his warm palms and the chilled medication made her shiver.

This was uncharted territory for both of them. Adrian had never tended to anyone like this before, and the intimacy of the act wasn't lost on him. Her skin felt like satin beneath his fingertips, her delicate arches fitting perfectly in his palms. The careful way he smoothed the cream over her burn felt almost reverential.

Vivian's cheeks burned hotter than her injured foot. All coherent thought evaporated as her pulse thundered in her ears. From this angle, she could study the sharp angle of his jaw, the way his dark lashes cast shadows across his cheekbones.

It was absurd, really. Here she was, resolved to walk away forever, yet utterly undone by the sight of Adrian Blackwood on his knees before her. The man who had built empires now played nurse with surprising competence, his entire focus devoted to her comfort.

A hysterical thought bubbled up - she could almost imagine him as some high-end escort from Mirage Lounge, paid to lavish attention on her. The fantasy was fleeting but potent enough to make her lips twitch.

Time seemed suspended until Adrian finally sat back, the angry red mark now covered in pale medicinal cream. As he worked, Dominic's earlier words had echoed relentlessly in his mind.

Looking up into her startled eyes, Adrian exhaled shakily. "I'm sorry," he murmured, the words weighted with years of regret.

Vivian froze, certain she'd misheard. Adrian Blackwood didn't apologize. Not to anyone. Not ever.

His gaze dropped to the jagged scar marring her otherwise flawless skin - a permanent reminder of the fire that had nearly claimed her. The sight made his throat tighten with remorse.

"I should have been there," he continued hoarsely, his fingers hovering just above the old wound. "That night... I'll regret it until my dying breath."

The raw sincerity in his voice shattered Vivian's carefully constructed defenses. Her breath came in shallow bursts as decades of pain and betrayal warred with this unexpected vulnerability from the man who had once been her entire world.

Outside, the golden light shifted as clouds drifted across the sun, casting the room into temporary shadow. Somewhere in the distance, a clock chimed the hour, its solemn tones marking this moment of unexpected reckoning.
###Chapter 121

Vivian's heart churned with conflicting emotions—a turbulent storm of memories and present realities. Had these apologies come earlier, she might have dived headfirst back into their broken marriage without hesitation. But that ship had sailed. She'd rebuilt her walls, fortified her heart. Turning back wasn't an option anymore.

She dipped her chin, her voice barely above a whisper. "It's alright. That's all in the past now. I forgive you."

The past couldn't be rewritten, no matter how much one dwelled on it. His belated apology served as final punctuation to their story. Even goodbyes deserved grace. Watching him retreat, she felt no need to cling to bitterness.

As she spoke, she noticed Adrian's fingers still lingering on her ankle and quickly pulled away.

Adrian recognized the quiet rejection. With his apology given and her forgiveness granted, he believed they'd reached closure. A weight lifted from his shoulders as he stood, casually rolling up his sleeves. "I'll whip up some pasta. You just relax."

Before Vivian could respond, Adrian had already disappeared into the kitchen, the sounds of clattering pots and running water filling the space.

Vivian arched an eyebrow, muttering under her breath, "Since when does he cook?" The image of Adrian Blackwood—ruthless business magnate—standing at a stove seemed utterly incongruous to her.

From the kitchen doorway, Adrian shot her a fleeting glance before returning to his task. He scrubbed the pot with surprising efficiency, set water boiling, and began preparing the meal with practiced movements that betrayed hidden culinary skills.

In Vivian's traditional worldview, men cooking somehow diminished their masculinity. Yet Adrian shattered that stereotype effortlessly. With his shirt unbuttoned just enough to reveal the strong lines of his collarbones, his forearms flexing as he worked—veins tracing paths down to his capable hands—he moved through the kitchen with unexpected grace.

There was something mesmerizing about his movements, an unconscious sensuality that held her gaze. Watching him navigate the domestic space became an unexpected pleasure, a visual indulgence that fed something deeper than hunger.

Soon, two steaming plates of spaghetti appeared on the dining table. "Why are you still sitting there? Wash up and let's eat," Adrian called, snapping her from her trance.

"Oh." Vivian blinked, suddenly aware she was already moving toward the sink. The domesticity of the moment felt bittersweet—a glimpse of married life they'd never truly had, now on the brink of ending.

Returning to the table, she faced the intimate setup—the small square surface left no room for emotional distance. After a brief hesitation, she chose the chair directly opposite Adrian, their knees almost touching beneath the table.

The plates held perfectly arranged spaghetti, each topped with a flawlessly cooked egg and generous sauce. Vivian's portion, she noticed, had an extra swirl of her favorite sauce—a silent testament to Adrian's attention to her preferences.

Outwardly composed, Vivian's emotions raged like the gathering storm outside. The food became her sole anchor. The rich, savory pasta proved a welcome distraction, and she ate quickly, her hunger overriding other sensations.

Adrian's eyes gleamed with quiet satisfaction as he noted her clean plate. "So," he asked, lips quirking, "can I cook or what?"
###Chapter 122

The sudden question made Vivian blink in surprise. It took her a moment to realize Adrian was referring to her casual remark about his cooking skills earlier.

She couldn't help but roll her eyes internally. Was he really this petty?

The doorbell rang, interrupting their tense moment. Vivian moved to answer it, finding Ethan standing there with two overflowing shopping bags. They contained all of Adrian's preferred toiletries and sleepwear.

Ethan flashed an apologetic smile despite the pouring rain behind him. "The storm's causing leaks at Seabreeze Villa. Would you mind if Mr. Blackwood stayed here tonight? I'll come pick him up first thing tomorrow."

This was clearly another matchmaking attempt. Vivian wasn't naive enough to believe otherwise. With their divorce proceedings underway, any prolonged contact would only complicate matters.

"I'm afraid that's not possible," she said calmly. "I don't have a guest room available."

Adrian, who had been cautiously optimistic after their earlier tentative truce, felt his mood darken at her refusal.

"Besides," Vivian continued evenly, "my agent might drop by later for a business discussion. It would be inconvenient. But I can arrange a car to take him home if you're busy."

Adrian's expression turned glacial. He had humbled himself more than ever before - extending olive branches, cooking meals, seeking forgiveness. Yet she remained as distant as ever. Maybe Dominic's romantic notions about relationships were just naive fantasies.

The coffee cup slammed onto the counter with a sharp crack. Adrian strode forward, his voice cutting through the room. "If you can't properly manage your duties, perhaps I should find an assistant who can."

Ethan, caught off guard by the sudden hostility, wisely chose not to push further. He stepped aside politely. "Shall I drive you home now, Mr. Blackwood?"

Without so much as a backward glance at Vivian, Adrian stormed out, Ethan following closely. Vivian watched the elevator doors close behind them before shutting her own door softly. An unexpected emptiness settled in her chest.

Her phone chimed, pulling her from her thoughts. Two Twitter notifications appeared. The first was from Ivory Phoenix Productions: "Exciting new project coming soon! @SebastianHartwell @VivianHartley."

The second was Sebastian's enthusiastic retweet: "Can't wait to collaborate with @VivianHartley!"

Vivian frowned. Sebastian was notoriously unpredictable - his emotional outbursts and impulsive decisions were industry legend. Yet somehow he'd risen to the top. Whether through raw talent or sheer luck remained debatable.

As a superstar with a massive female fanbase, Sebastian rarely mentioned colleagues publicly. His sudden social media acknowledgment could spell trouble. If fans started speculating or if someone malicious twisted their professional relationship into something more, Vivian's reputation could suffer.
###Chapter 123

Vivian stretched across the plush sofa, her fingers dancing nervously across her phone screen. As she scrolled through the flood of notifications, a slow smile spread across her face. The internet was ablaze with excitement - and most comments were glowing with anticipation for the new project. Fans raved about Sebastian's previous roles while a smaller group recognized Vivian, their compliments subtly reinforcing Sebastian's impeccable taste in co-stars.

"Sebastian Hartwell is back! I've rewatched his entire filmography three times - nobody does romantic tension like him."

"Any hints about the plot? The secrecy is killing me!"

"Ivory Phoenix always works with Vivian Hartley. Since Sebastian openly admires her, could this be his dream collaboration?"

"That stunning face was made to share the screen with Sebastian."

"Wasn't she the one who auditioned for 'Blazing Horizon'? Sebastian really prioritizes talent over industry connections."

Choosing not to read further, Vivian retweeted the announcement with a simple caption: "Honored to be working with you, Mr. Hartwell."

Moments later, her phone buzzed - a WhatsApp notification. Sebastian had sent a friend request through their mutual contact Damien Vaughn. After exchanging pleasantries, he extended an invitation: "A friend's opening a new restaurant. Would you join me to celebrate the start of 'Ambermyst'?"

Caught unprepared, Vivian typed a hesitant reply before she could overthink it: "I'd love to."

Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Vivian, another trending topic exploded on Twitter.

"Serena Whitmore: A Star Who Built Her Own Empire"

The post featured carefully edited clips of Serena performing motorcycle stunts on the set of Blazing Horizon, praising her for doing her own stunts and achieving success through hard work. Yet the footage lacked context - tight shots that could have been easily faked without actual riding skills.

Internet memory is fickle. The whispers about Serena's past scandals had nearly faded when her name suddenly resurged alongside Vivian's in the trends, reviving memories of her leaked audition tape. Though Adrian Blackwood had scrubbed it from the web years ago, some diligent netizens had preserved copies and chose this moment to resurface them.

The internet connected dots that didn't exist. Outright accusations might be dismissed, but when users "discovered" patterns themselves, they clung to them as absolute truth.

As speculation grew, more people questioned Serena's rise to fame, interpreting Sebastian's past refusal to work with her as evidence of undisclosed drama. Serena's team had likely orchestrated the trending topic to curry favor, unaware it would backfire spectacularly. The intended narrative - showcasing Serena's independence while subtly undermining Vivian - collapsed under scrutiny of Serena's limited acting range and persistent rumors about wealthy benefactors.

Even Sebastian's comment section began shifting tone:

"Vivian should send flowers to the Blazing Horizon team. Their rejection led her straight to Sebastian - and with his golden touch, stardom is guaranteed."
###Chapter 124

"I remember Sebastian refusing to join Serena on that reality show before. People called him stuck-up. But after seeing Serena's audition tape? Honestly? Good call, Sebastian."

"Blazing Horizon lost its charm for me. It's just a money grab now."

"Poor Julian. I genuinely respected him. Talented and hardworking, just like Sebastian."

In the serene luxury spa suite, Serena suddenly bolted upright from her massage table and hurled her phone against the wall in fury. The startled aesthetician froze, unsure how to react.

"Leave us," Miranda commanded, dismissing the staff with a sharp gesture before retrieving the phone. The plush carpet had cushioned its fall, the screen still displaying the relentless Twitter feed.

Miranda exhaled sharply through her nose. "The new PR team completely botched this. Their strategy is amateurish. I'll have to personally oversee damage control."

Serena ripped off her gold-infused face mask and threw it to the marble floor. "That spoiled brat Damien Vaughn is actually using Sebastian to promote Vivian? While she's still married to Adrian Blackwood? Has he lost his mind, willing to start a war between the Vaughns and Blackwoods over some married woman?"

Placing the phone on the side table, Miranda kept her voice measured. "Just internet trolls making noise. Not worth your energy. Your health comes first - don't let this nonsense affect your recovery."

"That hypocrite Sebastian, acting all high and mighty, yet groveling before Damien. Disgusting!" Serena refused to believe Sebastian's admiration for Vivian was genuine. In her mind, it had to be Damien's manipulation. "Why are you panicking? Vivian's still a nobody. Her new project hasn't even started filming. This game isn't over yet. Sebastian's fans might worship her now, but if any connection between them surfaces? That spotlight will become a wildfire that burns her career to ashes."

Miranda's eyes glinted with cold amusement at the thought.

Days later at The Northern Kitchen, Vivian found herself invited to dinner with Sebastian. After weeks of relentless rain, she'd dressed for the chilly evening in a delicate off-shoulder ivory sweater that accentuated her collarbones, paired with form-fitting black jeans and stiletto boots that turned heads as she walked through the restaurant.

Approaching the private dining room, Vivian overheard Sebastian through the slightly ajar door. "Should I go meet her?" His manager Harrison groaned audibly. "For heaven's sake, stay put. Your 'goddess' can find her own way."

Vivian was about to enter when a voice called out behind her. She turned to see Julian emerging from another private room across the hall, trailed by Serena and the rest of the Blazing Horizon cast and crew.

Ignoring Serena completely, Vivian smiled warmly at Julian and director Gregory Thornton. "Mr. Montoya, Mr. Thornton."

Julian's face lit up in recognition. "Just a little cast bonding dinner," he explained. Though Sebastian's tweet hadn't caused major waves publicly, it had certainly stirred the pot among the Blazing Horizon team. Miranda had reignited the leaked audition controversy, blaming the production team for the backlash against Serena's reputation.
###Chapter 125

The tension in the room was palpable. Vivian used her argument to push for more screen time for Serena. The crew stayed silent, but their expressions betrayed their frustration. The air crackled with unspoken words.

Gregory, sensing the brewing storm, suggested a team dinner to ease the tension.

Sebastian appeared, drawn by the commotion. His sharp gaze swept over the group before softening when it landed on Vivian. He moved toward her. "You're here," he murmured.

Gregory seized the opportunity. "Sebastian! You should join us for dinner."

Sebastian had been looking forward to a private meal with Vivian. Before he could decline, Harrison smoothly intervened. "Sebastian and Ms. Hartley need to go over the script. They'll have to skip dinner tonight."

Julian chuckled knowingly. "Ah, so absorbed in the script? Vivian is quite the talented actress—perceptive too. Sebastian, you should mentor her more. She has incredible potential."

A faint smile touched Sebastian's lips at Julian's praise. "Julian, let's arrange a separate dinner soon," he offered.

In the entertainment world, respect wasn't just about seniority. His invitation was a nod to Vivian's rising status. Julian sighed inwardly, comparing Vivian's genuine talent to Serena's reliance on connections.

Serena's irritation flared as she watched Sebastian and Julian side with Vivian. She recalled the humiliation when Sebastian had publicly refused to work with her on Spotlight Night.

During the show, when Serena had praised Vivian, the host suggested a collaboration between them. Most would decline politely, but Sebastian had bluntly stated that Vivian's projects required real skill—a thinly veiled insult that left Serena seething.

What did it matter if Sebastian was a top star? Next to someone like Adrian Blackwood, he was nothing. Serena scoffed. "Vivian, your luck is astounding. With Mr. Vaughn backing you and Mr. Hartwell clearing his schedule for rehearsals, fame is guaranteed. If everyone had such privileges, Hollywood would be overflowing with stars."

Her words implied Vivian relied on powerful connections while mocking Sebastian's deference to industry elites. Sebastian's expression darkened. "It's rare to find a partner like Vivian. Some can't tell talent from mediocrity. Honestly, I should thank Blazing Horizon for overlooking her—it gave me the chance to work with her."

His bluntness stung, offending everyone from Blazing Horizon. They could criticize him all they wanted, but they had no right to insult his idol.

Serena, caught off guard by his directness, clenched her fists. Miranda, fearing Serena would lose control, stepped in. "Mr. Hartwell, defending your colleague is admirable, but your words are unnecessarily harsh."

Vivian, unwilling to let Sebastian take the heat alone, countered, "Who started this conversation? Only the privileged get to speak now?"

The room fell silent.

The battle lines were drawn.
###Chapter 126

"Without consequences? Did I suddenly wake up in a world where Ms. Whitmore controls the entire entertainment industry?"

"If she wanted, even an A-list actor would grovel at her feet, and Oscar winners wouldn't dare cross her!" Adrian Blackwood's icy voice cut through the tension as he materialized from the shadows.

Adrian's mood was darker than storm clouds. When had Vivian Hartley become every man's obsession? First, she'd caught Damien Vaughn's attention, now she was openly siding with Sebastian Hartwell. Even Julian Montoya had defended her recently.

A disturbing realization struck Adrian - Vivian had always been drawn to beautiful people. He remembered overhearing her once complimenting his appearance to a friend. At the time, it meant nothing. But now, seeing Sebastian and Julian - both devastatingly handsome - and recalling Damien's reputation as the most attractive CEO in Crestwood, a cold dread slithered down his spine.

Adrian's expression turned glacial, his lips curling in silent derision. Was her affection really that shallow?

Serena noticed the shift in Adrian's demeanor. She understood his sudden outburst wasn't about defending her, but battling unexpected jealousy. Choosing to ignore it, she gently chided, "Adrian, darling, they're not worth your anger." She wanted Vivian to understand every word from Adrian's lips was for her protection.

"It's all just a silly misunderstanding," Gregory Thornton interjected hastily, swinging open the private dining room door to diffuse the situation. "Mr. Blackwood, perfect timing. We've just arrived. Serena must be exhausted from today's shoot. Let's not stand around - please, everyone inside."

Vivian's gaze lingered on Adrian's stormy expression, making her question whether his earlier apology at Sapphire Springs had been a fever dream.

Whenever Serena appeared, Adrian transformed into a stranger. Vivian had accepted his cold demeanor and emotional unavailability, but seeing him passionately defend another woman stabbed deeper than she cared to admit. Had she met Adrian before Serena entered his life, could things have been different? But the universe dealt no "what if" cards. Lowering her lashes, Vivian forcibly cleared her turbulent thoughts.

Treating Adrian like invisible smoke, she turned to Sebastian. "I'm starving. Let's go eat." Sebastian immediately brightened, opening the door wider as he smoothly changed topics. "Do you enjoy seafood? Their signature lobster thermidor is exceptional."

"Adrian," Serena murmured, her fingers lightly brushing his. Adrian's gaze reluctantly tore away from Vivian as he followed Serena into the adjacent private dining room. Did they expect him to compete for attention like some desperate reality star? His pride and upbringing would never allow such undignified behavior.

Inside Sebastian's private dining room, waiters efficiently laid out an extravagant spread of gourmet dishes, their presentation as lavish as their price tags. Sebastian enthusiastically described several house specialties to Vivian, showcasing his culinary knowledge. But Vivian remained distracted, her thoughts tangled in Adrian's unsettling behavior.

Sebastian noticed her preoccupation, misinterpreting it as concern over offending Adrian. He reassured her, "Don't worry. A few sharp words won't bring the world crashing down. Serena's powerful backers wouldn't dare touch you."

At that moment, Harrison Whitaker sharply interjected, "Sebastian! Mind your tongue before it gets you in real trouble."
###Chapter 127

Sebastian gave a careless shrug. "We're among friends here."

Harrison's voice turned stern. "You're involved in multiple high-profile deals with the Blackwood Group."

"Regardless of your personal feelings toward Adrian, you must keep them hidden. Those rumors might be entertainment for gossip blogs and idle chatter, but you, Sebastian, must never fuel them."

Vivian, who usually avoided Blackwood family affairs, was startled to discover Sebastian's connection to Adrian. There was an undeniable boldness radiating from him. He'd openly confronted the very woman his benefactor adored. Either Sebastian possessed extraordinary luck or remarkable talent to have climbed so far.

Watching his relaxed demeanor, Vivian felt compelled to offer advice. "Harrison makes a valid point, Sebastian. In your position, every word and gesture is scrutinized. You must be more careful."

Sebastian rubbed his neck sheepishly. "Understood. I'll be more cautious from now on."

Harrison shot Vivian a grateful look. "Vivian, you're the only one who can keep him in line. Now that you're working together, could you watch over him for me? His bluntness gives me daily heart attacks."

Vivian smiled gently. "Of course, Harrison. I'd be happy to."

The meal arrived shortly after, each dish a visual masterpiece promising exquisite flavors. Sebastian enthusiastically piled food onto Vivian's plate until it resembled a small mountain. Noticing her overwhelmed expression, Harrison smoothly changed topics. "Vivian, have you ever wondered why Sebastian admires you so much?"

Sebastian froze mid-serving, his head dipping slightly. "Harrison, why bring that up now?" Vivian's curiosity piqued. "What's the reason?"

"If you hold Vivian in such esteem, she deserves to know," Harrison replied. Turning to Vivian, he continued, "During Sebastian's overseas training days, there was a time he nearly quit everything. He refused to compromise his principles, yet despite his efforts, the future looked bleak. Then he discovered 'The Outsider' - it changed everything. He vowed to succeed and bring your stories to life, hoping to inspire others like himself."

'The Outsider,' one of Vivian's early works, told of ordinary people overcoming extraordinary odds. Touched, Vivian raised her glass. "To think my words could impact someone so deeply. To your perseverance, and thank you for appreciating my work."

Their glasses clinked together, the sound marking a new warmth between them. The lively conversation continued until three hours slipped away unnoticed, the restaurant nearly empty when they finally rose to leave.

Vivian excused herself to the restroom. Glancing down the corridor, she noticed the opposite private room stood vacant - Serena and her group had departed.

As she walked back, a solitary figure caught her attention. Dressed in a black shirt with a suit jacket draped over one arm, his features were partially obscured, but the unmistakable aura of detachment identified him instantly as Adrian.

###Chapter 128

Vivian was about to slip away when Adrian's sharp eyes caught her movement. He abruptly ended his phone call and closed the distance between them in three long strides. His arm shot out, blocking her path like an iron bar. "Stop."

With reluctant steps, Vivian froze, lifting her tired eyes to meet his piercing gaze. She wondered bitterly if fate was playing cruel jokes or if Adrian had become her personal shadow. There was a time she'd counted hours between their rare encounters. Now, no matter how hard she tried to avoid him, he materialized like clockwork.

"Grandmother's birthday is on the thirtieth. You're coming with me," he declared, his voice flat and emotionless as if reading a business memo.

"That's not happening," Vivian countered softly but firmly. "I already explained about our divorce during my last visit. Pretending we're still a happy couple would be cruel. Though I'll send my own gift—"

Adrian's expression turned glacial. "Why involve Grandmother in our private matters?"

She studied him, sorrow pooling in her eyes. "A divorce isn't some minor disagreement, Adrian. It's life-altering. Shouldn't family know the truth about something this important?"

His voice dropped to subzero temperatures. "No papers have been signed. Do you expect the world to revolve around your sudden whims?"

"Whims?" Vivian's voice cracked with frustration. "This divorce is happening—today, tomorrow, next month. The only difference is how many more lies we'll have to tell before then."

The emotional weight pressed down on her shoulders. Building this marriage had been a battle; ending it proved equally exhausting.

Your next story begins at galnovels.

She knew Adrian wasn't truly resisting the divorce or misunderstanding her motives. What he couldn't accept was losing control of the situation.

Adrian's dark eyes bored into hers. "Why this insistence on divorce? If it's still about the fire incident, I've apologized repeatedly. How long will you punish me for one mistake?"

Despair flooded Vivian's veins. He always reduced their crumbling marriage to that single incident. As if their relationship wasn't already hollow—haunted by another woman's ghost—yet he kept pretending they could paper over the cracks.

Too drained to argue, Vivian looked away in silence.

Suddenly, realization flashed across Adrian's face. He braced both hands against the wall behind her, caging her in. His voice turned dangerously quiet. "Tell me the truth—is there someone else?"

Vivian's lips parted in shock before twisting into a bitter smile. "Unlike you, I don't make a habit of emotional betrayals."

Adrian's control shattered. "Stop dodging! Just answer the damn question!"

"What the hell are you—"

###Chapter 129

The moment Adrian Blackwood loomed over Vivian Hartley with that predatory stance, Sebastian Hartwell emerged from the shadows. His protective instincts flared when he saw Adrian cornering Vivian—he assumed it was another cruel game connected to Serena Whitmore.

Sebastian's fist flew before he could think.

"Watch out!" Vivian moved like lightning, shoving Adrian aside and taking the blow herself. Sebastian tried to pull back, but momentum carried his knuckles straight into her bare shoulder. The impact left an angry red mark blooming across her skin.

Sebastian's arm froze mid-air. "Vivian—Christ, are you hurt?"

"What the fuck is wrong with you?" Adrian's voice cut through the air like a blade. His gaze burned with fury as it landed on the bruise forming on Vivian's shoulder. When his eyes snapped to Sebastian, the temperature seemed to drop ten degrees.

With deliberate slowness, Adrian shrugged off his tailored jacket, letting it crumple to the ground like trash. The gesture screamed danger. Vivian's stomach twisted. This wasn't just anger—this was the eerie calm before Adrian's infamous storms.

She'd seen this side of him before. The memory played in her mind like a horror film. That night at Mirage Lounge, when a drunk investor had made a vulgar comment about Serena. Without warning, Adrian had walked into that VIP room like death incarnate. The man had ended up in the hospital with three broken ribs and a shattered jaw. No amount of pleading from Vivian had stopped Adrian's rampage that night.

Now, as Sebastian stood there, confusion and guilt written across his face, Vivian knew history was about to repeat itself. She hadn't stepped in front of Adrian to protect him—she'd done it to save Sebastian from becoming another casualty of Adrian's wrath.

"Don't!" Vivian gritted her teeth against the throbbing pain and grabbed Adrian's arm, her fingers trembling but insistent.

His dark eyes locked onto hers, unreadable. That she'd shielded him moments ago had struck something primal in him. But seeing her intervene for Sebastian now? That twisted something painful in his chest. When had she started extending that protective instinct to others?

Harrison Whitaker rushed over, his face pale with confusion. He looked to Vivian for explanation.

Forcing a smile, Vivian tried to diffuse the tension. "It's fine. Really. Just a scratch—I'm not made of glass." Her attempt at lightness only made Adrian's expression darken further.

He turned to Sebastian and Harrison, his voice glacial. "You might want to reconsider that partnership with Blackwood Group. From where I'm standing, you've just lost all privilege to it."

Harrison's face went sheet-white, sweat beading at his temples.

###Chapter 130

Vivian watched as Sebastian's hands shot up in surrender, his voice trembling. "This isn't what it looks like! Total misunderstanding!"

She kept her composure flawless, turning to Adrian with icy calm. "Just an accident. He was trying to shield me. Don't make this dramatic."

The air crackled as Adrian and Sebastian locked gazes, an unspoken challenge passing between them.

Sebastian's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "If you've got issues with me, take it up directly. Leave her out of this. I'm the one who insulted Serena. Threw the first punch too. She took the hit for you. Cancel the endorsement if you want—"

Harrison pieced together the situation instantly. He stepped between the two men like a human shield. "Mr. Blackwood, youthful impulsiveness. Surely not worth your attention."

Vivian exhaled sharply, crossing her arms. "Really, Adrian? Picking on someone younger than you?" Her earlier protective stance made the words land like knives.

That phrase—"younger than you"—seemed to drain the fight from Adrian. Was that all this was? Some maternal instinct toward a naive boy?

Adrian's assessing gaze swept over Sebastian again. The expensive suit couldn't disguise the puppyish uncertainty in those eyes. For all his height, just a clumsy kid playing dress-up.

Seeing Adrian's shoulders relax marginally, Harrison pressed his advantage. "Mr. Blackwood, please consider—"

Adrian cut him off with a dismissive flick of his wrist. "Don't flatter yourself. He's beneath my notice."

The subtext screamed louder than words—Sebastian wasn't worth the energy.

Vivian jerked her chin toward the exit. "Harrison, take him and go."

Sebastian planted his feet. "Not without you," he growled, eyes never leaving Adrian. "I don't like you alone with him."

"Harrison," Vivian's voice turned steely, "I know Mr. Blackwood. Remove Sebastian. Now."

Adrian's lips twitched at her commanding tone. He turned away, granting silent permission for their departure.

Harrison's nervous gaze darted between them before he began apologizing profusely to Adrian while trying to steer Sebastian toward the door.

Sebastian resisted until Harrison hissed in his ear, "Fine, ruin your career. But ready to tank your idol's chances before she even debuts?"

The words hit like a gut punch. Shoulders slumping, Sebastian finally moved—but not without shooting Adrian a venomous glare over his shoulder, dragging his feet like a petulant child.

As they retreated, Harrison muttered under his breath, "Christ."

The heavy door clicked shut behind them.

Silence.

Then Adrian turned slowly, his gaze burning into Vivian. "Now," he purred, "where were we?"
###Chapter 131

The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the pavement as Vivian watched their retreating figures vanish around the corner. Turning back to Adrian, she squared her shoulders with deliberate composure. "Leave Sebastian out of this. I'll attend your grandmother's gala if you drop the matter."

Adrian's lips curled in a sardonic smile, his gaze sharp as cut glass. "Since when did the brilliant screenwriter become a bodyguard for some rookie actor?"

Vivian didn't flinch. Her voice remained steady as tempered steel. "Do we have an agreement or not?"

A muscle twitched in his jaw before he exhaled sharply. "Fine. The boy's hardly worth my attention anyway." His eyes flickered to the angry red mark on her collarbone where Sebastian had shoved her earlier. The rigid set of his shoulders softened marginally. "Let's get that looked at by a physician."

She opened her mouth to protest, then caught the dangerous glint in Adrian's eyes. One wrong move and his simmering temper might redirect toward Sebastian. Swallowing her pride, she gave a terse nod. "Let me get my purse."

Adrian tapped his watch. "Five minutes. I'll be in the car."

Outside The Emerald Pizzeria, Vivian approached the waiting Bentley where Ethan already stood holding the rear door. Leaning against the polished black chassis with phone pressed to his ear, Ethan barked orders to someone. "Have the medical team meet us at Seabreeze Villa immediately." Vivian's brows knitted in confusion - since when did a minor scrape warrant summoning the Blackwood family physicians?

Her indifference toward medical attention paled against her greater concern - keeping Adrian's wrath from falling on Sebastian. Complying with his demands seemed a small price to pay. Without comment, she slid into the supple leather seat.

Adrian sat immersed in a video conference, the glow from his laptop accentuating the sharp angles of his profile. Power radiated from him like an electrical current, that effortless magnetism that made boardrooms fall silent when he entered. This was a man accustomed to bending the world to his will.

Vivian averted her gaze, sinking deeper into the seat just as Adrian abruptly closed his laptop. His hand shot out to adjust her disheveled sweater, making her recoil violently. The sudden movement caused the loose knit fabric to slip, exposing the delicate curve of her shoulder. His fingers stilled against the fabric, eyes lingering on the flushed skin before traveling up to meet her startled expression.

Her wide eyes held the skittish wariness of a woodland creature caught in a hunter's sights, torn between fight and flight. For a suspended moment, the air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

He released the fabric with deliberate slowness. "Dress more appropriately next time," he clipped, returning his attention to the laptop as if nothing had happened.

Vivian hastily righted her sweater, her pulse hammering against her ribs. "It's just a scratch," she muttered, turning to stare resolutely out the tinted window as the car pulled away from the curb.

The silence between them stretched taut as a bowstring, charged with all the things left unsaid.
###Chapter 132

The luxurious car's interior gradually filled with warmth, carrying the subtle scent of sandalwood from Adrian's cologne. Vivian turned her face toward the window, watching the city lights blur past. His sharp profile reflected against the glass, close yet impossibly distant.

As the vehicle halted before Seabreeze Villa's grand gates, Vivian didn't wait for Ethan's assistance. She pushed the door open herself, her heels clicking against the cobblestone driveway.

She'd barely taken three steps when the villa's ornate doors flew open. Gwendolyn stood frozen in the doorway, her welcoming smile twisting into a grimace. "You?" The single word dripped with venomous surprise.

Only moments earlier, the driver had returned with a team of foreign specialists. Gwendolyn had been certain Adrian would bring Serena home. Now faced with Vivian's unexpected appearance, her mind jumped to worst-case scenarios.

Adrian's arrival cut through the tension like winter wind. Ethan immediately stepped forward, his voice laced with warning. "Mind your manners when addressing Mrs. Blackwood."

Gwendolyn's hands trembled as she forced a curtsy. "My apologies, Mr. Blackwood. I was simply... overwhelmed with joy at Mrs. Blackwood's return."

Adrian's glacial stare made the autumn air feel warm by comparison. "If you cannot conduct yourself appropriately, consider this your final warning."

Gwendolyn's throat constricted. Positions like this—with their generous salaries and elite social circles—were nearly impossible to obtain. A dismissal would ruin her reputation among high society employers.

Panic turned her movements jerky. Before anyone could react, she dropped to her knees before Vivian, striking her own cheeks with sharp slaps that echoed across the courtyard. Crimson handprints bloomed across her pale skin.

"Mrs. Blackwood!" she begged between gasps. "Please forgive this foolish woman! I spoke without thinking—I was just so shocked to see you here!" Her fingers clutched at Vivian's coat hem. "Have mercy on someone as ignorant as myself!"

Vivian recoiled, stepping neatly out of reach. "Your employment isn't my concern." Her voice remained cool, detached. She'd long exhausted any sympathy for this woman. Their divorce had severed any obligation to intervene in household affairs.

Misreading Vivian's indifference as tacit approval, Gwendolyn turned pleading eyes toward Adrian. "Mr. Blackwood, Mrs. Blackwood has forgiven me! Please—"

Adrian's jaw tightened. "See that it never happens again."

Gwendolyn scrambled upright, smoothing her wrinkled uniform with shaking hands. "Thank you, Mr. Blackwood! Thank you, Mrs. Blackwood!" Her smile stretched too wide, her eyes glinting with something darker than gratitude as they flicked toward Vivian.

This humiliation would not go unanswered. Vivian's sudden reappearance threatened everything Gwendolyn had worked for. As long as the Blackwoods remained connected, her position would never be secure.

The seeds of vengeance took root in her heart, watered by wounded pride. She would ensure this marriage stayed buried—no matter the cost.
###Chapter 133

The moment Gwendolyn handed the slippers to Adrian and Vivian, she couldn't resist asking, "The physicians have been waiting, Mr. Blackwood. May I know what brings you here today?"

Adrian's face twisted with barely concealed contempt. Ethan shot Gwendolyn a warning look, his voice cutting like ice. "Mind your own business." He didn't wait for her reaction before striding into the parlor.

Switching seamlessly to German, he addressed the medical team. "The examination room is upstairs. Follow me."

Gwendolyn lingered for only a second before retreating to her quarters. Her fingers flew across her phone: "Mr. Blackwood returned with Vivian and several doctors. They've gone upstairs and barred me from following. Situation unclear."

The reply came instantly: "Maintain surveillance. Report any developments immediately."

In the second-floor medical suite, a female physician carefully lifted Vivian's sweater. The angry bruise spread across her porcelain skin like spilled ink, subcutaneous bleeding visible beneath the swelling. Though not life-threatening, the injury looked alarmingly painful.

Vivian sat motionless as a doll, her gaze distant while the doctor applied medication. The Vivian of old would have been sobbing dramatically, seeking Adrian's comfort with exaggerated pouts. That version of her had vanished in the fire's aftermath.

Even when she'd burned her foot at Cascade Residences, her initial cry had quickly dulled into indifference once Adrian noticed. He used to mock her theatrics. Now that she'd changed, his expected relief never came.

After initial treatment, another doctor approached with advanced scanning equipment.

"Mrs. Blackwood," he said gently, "could you roll up your trousers? We need to examine your burn recovery." Only then did Vivian realize Adrian had specifically arranged this examination for her scars. She lowered her lashes, concealing the flicker in her eyes. This was typical Adrian - obsessively practical, a trait she'd once foolishly mistaken for affection.

Following a comprehensive evaluation, the lead physician reported to Adrian. "Mrs. Blackwood's healing progresses exceptionally well. The regenerative ointment not only repairs scar tissue but stimulates cellular renewal. Within months, the marks will be nearly invisible."

"Months?" Adrian's brow darkened.

The doctor remained patient. "Given the depth and extent of her injuries, this recovery speed is remarkable. Accelerating further risks complications."

Adrian crossed his arms. "Surely you've developed something more effective."

An elderly specialist stepped forward. "Mr. Blackwood, healing requires time. While experimental subcutaneous treatments exist, they carry risks without guaranteeing better results than current methods. Sometimes tradition outperforms innovation."

Adrian's relentless focus on efficiency confirmed Vivian's suspicion - this wasn't about her wellbeing, but about efficiently solving another problem with his endless resources. To him, the world operated on transactional logic where money greased every wheel. If something resisted, it simply required more financial pressure.

Breaking the tension, Vivian spoke calmly. "It's fine. A bit of makeup will cover it for filming."
###Chapter 134

Adrian's piercing gaze locked onto Vivian, his voice dripping with icy detachment. "I suppose if that scar doesn't fade, you'll keep using it as ammunition against me."

Ah. So that was his concern. Not her pain or recovery - just the potential for old wounds to be reopened. Vivian understood perfectly. The physical mark might disappear, but the emotional damage would linger.

The door swung open with theatrical timing, revealing Gwendolyn balancing an ornate tray with a steaming bowl. Her saccharine smile was as artificial as the garnishes floating in the consommé.

"Mrs. Blackwood, I prepared some nourishing broth for you."

Gwendolyn had outdone herself with the presentation - edible gold leaf and truffle shavings adorned the surface. Vivian knew this sudden generosity wasn't born of kindness. During her hospital stay, such luxuries would have never left the kitchen staff's quarters. Now, the housekeeper sought to ingratiate herself.

A vibration cut through the tension as Vivian's phone lit up on the bedside table. She barely glanced at it. "Set it there. I'll eat later."

Gwendolyn hesitated before placing the tray down, her beady eyes scanning the room like a security camera. Vivian unlocked her device, intending to transcribe a voice memo. But her fingers betrayed her, and the message played aloud:

"The character arcs need stronger romantic tension in act two. Without proper buildup, the audience won't buy the finale's emotional payoff—" She stabbed at the screen to silence it, but too late.

Adrian's eyebrows arched. "Screenwriting?"

Vivian ignored him, typing a response without sparing him a glance. Meanwhile, Gwendolyn inched toward the exit, fingers slipping into her apron pocket. The subtle click of a speed-dial button was barely audible as she positioned herself just outside the door.

Recognition flickered in Adrian's eyes. "So that's how you accumulated 22 million in your account? Churning out melodramatic scripts?" His tone hovered between curiosity and contempt.

Vivian responded with a noncommittal hum, the sound deliberately dismissive.

The memory of that arrogant producer's voice memo reignited Adrian's irritation. The idea of his wife taking orders from some second-rate production company was intolerable. That a Blackwood would debase herself writing soap operas...

His jaw tightened. "Let me make this clear," he bit out, each word sharp as broken glass. "Have I ever denied you funds? Why degrade yourself writing such trivial nonsense?"

White-hot anger surged through Vivian. How dare he? His corporate machinations were deemed respectable while her creative work was dismissed as trash?

She hurled her phone onto the chaise, her retort razor-sharp. "Every word I write is earned through skill and effort. You may not understand artistry, but you will respect it!"

The medical staff present suddenly found the ceiling fascinating, their discomfort palpable.

Adrian stilled, the room holding its breath. Just as tension reached breaking point, he drawled, "At least it's better than acting. If writing amuses you, by all means continue."

The unspoken challenge hung between them like unsheathed blades.
###Chapter 135

Adrian's hesitation revealed the unspoken fear that Vivian might reject his offer. Without missing a beat, he extended a peace offering. "I happen to know someone currently seeking screenplays. The compensation would far exceed what those mediocre studios could offer." If Vivian agreed, he wouldn't hesitate to finance an entire production company. The quality of her scripts mattered little to him.

He could fund her projects as effortlessly as buying a limited-edition watch or commissioning a custom gown. Before he could elaborate further, his phone vibrated, the screen illuminating with a familiar name. Adrian hesitated briefly before accepting the call.

Serena's saccharine voice immediately filled the space between them. "Adrian darling, I've been thinking—I should really stock up on more scripts to expand my options," she cooed.

The atmosphere turned glacial. Though not on speakerphone, her words carried clearly enough for all present to hear. Adrian's gaze instinctively darted toward Vivian, a shadow of discomfort crossing his features. "I'll wire two million immediately," he murmured, lowering his voice. "Occupied at the moment. We'll talk tomorrow. Get some rest."

Serena didn't push, bidding him goodnight with practiced docility before disconnecting.

Tucking his phone away, Adrian lifted his eyes to meet Vivian's penetrating glare. Her expression was a tempest of fury and betrayal, eyes shimmering with unshed accusations.

His confusion was genuine.

"Would this mysterious script buyer happen to be Serena Whitmore?" Vivian's voice quivered with restrained emotion.

The question hung between them like a gathering storm. A friend? Lucrative script deals?

Vivian felt humiliation coil tightly in her chest. After everything they'd been through, had he truly stooped this low?

The unspoken implication weighed heavily in the air. If Blackwood Group needed scripts, they could hire any writer in the industry. Why involve her specifically?

Adrian frowned, shaking his head. "No. Why must you constantly drag Serena into everything?"

Vivian's laugh was sharp enough to cut glass. "If not her, then who? I've never heard of any associates of yours needing screenplays."

Adrian's eyes shifted away, his usual composure faltering. The excuse had been fabricated on the spot, and now he couldn't conjure a single plausible name.

Vivian's suspicions solidified. It had been Serena all along.

"Adrian, this is beyond unacceptable!" she exploded.

His suppressed anger mirrored hers. Adjusting his cufflinks with sharp movements, he retorted coldly, "What exactly do you want? You demand professional respect, and I'm providing opportunities. Yet you accuse me? Even if it were for Serena, wouldn't that be preferable to those second-rate production houses? She wouldn't be nearly as critical. Are you deliberately picking a fight, or do you genuinely believe I won't file for divorce?"

Vivian's temper erupted like wildfire. "Then do it—file the papers right now!" she shouted, storming toward the exit.

But frustration rooted her to the spot. Whirling around, her voice cracked with fury. "Opportunities? You've stolen my roles for her, and now expect me to grovel at her feet? Never! I'd rather burn every script I've ever written than let that fraud butcher my heroines and turn them into laughingstocks!"

She turned to leave again, but Ethan smoothly intercepted her path, his expression carefully neutral. "Mrs. Blackwood, Mr. Blackwood didn't intend—" Gwendolyn, barely concealing her amusement, added with false sweetness, "Mrs. Blackwood, won't you stay for some late-night refreshments before leaving?"

Adrian's expression darkened, his control fraying. "Let her go!" he snapped.
###Chapter 136

Vivian didn't hesitate. She pushed past Ethan with violent force, her entire body trembling with barely contained rage as she fled the scene.

At the gates, Adrian's polished Maybach sat gleaming under the moonlight like a smug predator. A dark impulse surged through her veins.

Channeling all her pent-up fury, she delivered a vicious kick to the driver's side door. The metallic shriek echoed through the night as an ugly dent deformed the flawless surface. Vivian didn't look back. The fleeting satisfaction fueled her escape into the darkness, her emotions a turbulent storm.

One Week Later

Emberglow County.

Surrounding Crestwood City, Emberglow County housed the legendary Sapphire Springs - a natural wonder steeped in history. The area had miraculously escaped urban sprawl, preserving its untouched beauty where wilderness still ruled supreme. Vivian had first discovered this paradise with Adrian during a location scouting trip. The breathtaking scenery had inspired her to feature it prominently in one of her screenplays.

Recently, Damien caught wind of Sapphire Springs' sudden popularity among social media influencers. The viral attention had local officials scrambling to develop the area into a tourist destination. Fearing construction delays, Damien accelerated the filming schedule. "We need to wrap these scenes before the bulldozers arrive."

The makeup artist's voice snapped Vivian back to reality. She nodded absently and offered the woman a small tin. "Try these herbal drops. Great for vocal strain and surprisingly delicious."

The makeup artist popped one gratefully, savoring the minty sweetness. The cast and crew's shared dedication created an unusually collaborative atmosphere.

By the water's edge, Adrian had arrived urgently after learning about the impending development plans. He'd long coveted this pristine location, though previous attempts to acquire it were blocked by environmental protections. But he never abandoned his ambitions.

Dressed in immaculate white, he paused mid-step, one polished shoe resting on a boulder as he surveyed the landscape. Walter Holloway, the development project manager, approached nervously, pointing toward a row of dilapidated cabins.

"Mr. Blackwood, notice how these guesthouses operate at minimal capacity. The recent mudslides destroyed half the properties. Locals remain unaware of the rezoning plans, still hoping for demolition payouts." Walter's usual commanding presence shriveled into deference around Adrian.

Adrian remained silent, his sharp gaze scanning the shoreline until it landed on a barefoot woman in a flowing white dress. Beside her stood a lean man, their silhouettes creating a striking contrast against the shimmering water.

Penelope Holloway, Walter's starstruck daughter, followed Adrian's line of sight. "Oh! That's Sebastian Hartwell!" she gasped. "And that must be his co-star!"

Since their explosive confrontation, Vivian had thrown herself into work, channeling all her energy into the film. Adrian hadn't contacted her - no calls, no texts. It was as if their connection had dissolved into nothingness.

Yet traces of their past lingered. Serena's Instagram posts occasionally contained subtle references to Adrian - inside jokes and details only someone intimately familiar with him would recognize.

###Chapter 137

Vivian's instincts screamed that these veiled gestures were aimed directly at her, crafted to unsettle. But why? To revel in some imagined victory? What exactly did Serena have to boast about? Vivian had left that chapter behind without a single backward glance.

With an irritated flick of her wrist, she blocked Serena on Instagram. Engaging in this ridiculous game of cryptic social media posts wasn't worth sacrificing her tranquility.

"Vivian, the storm's passed for now, but dark clouds are gathering again," someone called out.

"Aren't they just picture-perfect together? Like they stepped out of a romance novel!" Penelope gushed, turning to Adrian with newfound confidence. "Don't you agree, Mr. Blackwood?"

Adrian's mouth twisted into a sardonic smile. "Not particularly," he replied icily, standing taller and deliberately looking away.

Penelope's eyes widened in shock. "Even someone as stunning as her doesn't interest you? What kind of woman would catch your attention, Mr. Blackwood?"

Annoyance flashed in Adrian's stormy eyes. "Someone with depth," he clipped.

Walter, remembering earlier conversations about his daughter's academic achievements, puffed up with paternal pride.

Penelope flushed pink, misinterpreting his words as personal praise.

Walter continued showering compliments. "A man of Mr. Blackwood's caliber would never be impressed by superficial beauty."

Adrian's discomfort visibly grew, and just as he opened his mouth to respond, a thunderous crash silenced everyone.

The mudslide that hit nearby brought filming to an abrupt halt. The violent sound startled the entire crew, with one staff member pointing ahead in disbelief. "Look! Our reserved lodge is completely destroyed."

Sebastian, ever the joker, raised his hands in mock surrender. "Don't blame me! I was just kidding earlier." He recalled his offhand comment upon arrival about possibly camping if another landslide occurred. The eerie accuracy of his prediction sent chills down his spine.

"Let's assess the damage," the director sighed, rubbing his temples. He gestured for the group to follow him toward the devastated property.

Upon arrival, they found the lodge owners standing shell-shocked at the entrance. The destruction was evident - thick mud and debris filled every room, though miraculously, no injuries were reported.

A crew member groaned in frustration. "There's no way we can salvage this before nightfall. Where are we supposed to sleep?"

"Sleep here? Absolutely not!" Walter pushed forward, his secretary scrambling behind him. He rounded on the lodge owner angrily. "There were landslide warnings! How could you still be operating?"

The owner wiped his muddy hands on his pants guiltily. "The weather cleared up this morning. Who could've predicted...?"

Exhausted but composed, Vivian stepped forward to take control. "First, let's retrieve our belongings and check for damage. Then we'll scout for nearby hotels or rental properties," she said calmly, her authoritative voice cutting through the panic.

The crew immediately snapped into action, rushing inside to salvage what they could from the ruined lodge.
###Chapter 138

Vivian took charge immediately, collecting her belongings with effortless grace. Penelope, eager to impress her celebrity crush Sebastian, tugged at her father's sleeve with starry-eyed enthusiasm. "Papa, our guesthouse has plenty of rooms available. We could host the entire film crew."

Walter hesitated, his businessman's mind calculating risks. Though their establishment wasn't officially open for business, housing a production team wasn't illegal. Yet Walter, ever the pragmatist, doubted entertainment industry connections would benefit their small-town enterprise.

Noticing her father's reluctance, Penelope leaned in conspiratorially. "They're shooting a major production here. Sebastian is Hollywood royalty - everything he touches turns to gold. Imagine the tourism boost if we get featured! This could be our golden ticket to becoming their official hospitality partners."

Walter's eyes gleamed with sudden interest. Just as he prepared to agree, he caught Adrian's imposing figure nearby, his expression unreadable. Walter approached cautiously. "Mr. Blackwood, would it inconvenience you if we accommodated the film crew here?"

Adrian's response came clipped and indifferent. "Do what you want. Just keep them away from my space. I detest disturbances."

Relieved by the lack of objection, Walter beamed. "Naturally, Mr. Blackwood. Your suite is already prepared separately."

Emboldened, Penelope practically skipped to Sebastian. "Mr. Hartwell! We'd be honored to host your team. Our guesthouse has county government backing and all the amenities you'll need."

Sebastian set down his luggage with a charming smile. "That's incredibly generous. Let me inform the director immediately." As he turned, he spotted Vivian exiting with an armful of prop boxes. Without hesitation, he rushed to her side. "You shouldn't be carrying all that alone. Here, let me help."

Vivian's cream dress bore smudges from the day's work, yet she carried herself with unshaken dignity. From his vantage point, Adrian's gaze turned glacial. Vivian felt the weight of his stare and glanced up, their eyes locking momentarily. A strange current passed between them before Ethan smoothly intervened. "Ms. Hartley, allow me. Those boxes are too cumbersome in your dress."

After a brief hesitation, Vivian relinquished the items. "Sebastian," she said evenly, "you should go finalize the lodging arrangements with the director first."

With an obedient nod, Sebastian departed. Penelope observed the exchange, noting Adrian's intense scrutiny. Her pulse quickened - was that jealousy she detected in his piercing gaze?

Thirty minutes later, the crew assembled at the guesthouse, expecting rustic accommodations. Instead, they discovered a meticulously preserved historical estate featuring landscaped gardens and winding corridors that housed both guest rooms and a full-service restaurant - where dinner would be served.

The large group dispersed across three tables. Adrian's table included construction firm representatives and material suppliers who'd discreetly leveraged connections to meet the elusive billionaire.

After introducing these newcomers, Walter proudly presented the film crew to his business associates. "Our distinguished guests from Ivory Phoenix Productions!" In the world of commerce, one never knew when such connections might prove valuable.
###Chapter 139

"Mr. Hartwell, your accomplishments at this stage of your career are remarkable. I've admired your work in several productions. My niece adores you!"

"Ms. Hartley, you're absolutely breathtaking. When this series premieres, it's guaranteed to dominate the ratings. From across the room, your radiant presence completely mesmerized me."

"Who would have guessed Ms. Hartley had such executive presence? She carries herself like the chairwoman of a Fortune 500 company!"

Having changed out of the dirt-stained costume from filming, Vivian now wore a cream silk blouse with delicate gold embroidery, paired with tailored black trousers. Her natural poise seemed to amplify her commanding presence.

The businessmen surrounding her were visibly enchanted, their expressions a mix of admiration and respect, though none dared overstep professional boundaries.

Breaking his usual reserved demeanor, Sebastian joined the chorus of compliments. "Vivian truly redefines beauty standards in our industry!" His gaze softened as he turned toward her. "Though her talent outshines even her striking appearance."

The sharp-eyed executives exchanged knowing smiles. "Mr. Hartwell and Ms. Hartley make an extraordinary pairing."

At the adjacent table, Penelope murmured under her breath, "Sebastian always has Vivian's back. Ever since their collaboration was announced, there's been this undeniable chemistry between them. I'm clearly not the only one who thinks they're perfect together!"

Hearing this, Adrian paused mid-motion, his eyes lifting to meet his companions' before asking in a deceptively calm tone, "Is that so?"

Ethan felt an involuntary shiver and quickly interjected, "Sebastian's too young. Next to Ms. Hartley, they could be mistaken for siblings."

Though the private dining room wasn't large, Ethan's words carried clearly. Uncertain of Adrian's intentions, the other guests suddenly became very interested in their plates.

Penelope frowned, studying the pair again before remarking, "Really? Vivian looks quite youthful herself."

With absolute conviction, Ethan declared, "Undoubtedly! Their energies are completely different! They're nothing alike! A woman of Ms. Hartley's stature deserves someone more... accomplished."

Vivian suppressed a quiet chuckle, shaking her head slightly—Ethan was the most shamelessly devoted assistant she'd ever encountered.

Adrian casually picked up a morsel from his plate, set it down untouched, then turned to Vivian with a pointed question. "Ms. Hartley, do you find Ethan's observations amusing?" The atmosphere instantly grew charged with tension.

The production crew members exchanged nervous glances, their attention shifting anxiously toward Vivian.

Vivian hesitated momentarily, shooting Adrian a sharp look before responding casually, "Mr. Blackwood, you misunderstand. I didn't catch Ethan's comment. I was just remembering a particularly troublesome stray dog from my childhood village."

Adrian was nothing but trouble—wherever he appeared, chaos inevitably followed.
###Chapter 140

The warmth in Adrian's gaze vanished, replaced by an arctic chill. During their honeymoon phase, Vivian had frequently reminisced about her childhood, including stories about a particularly aggressive neighborhood dog that terrorized deliverymen. Her current words carried that same biting undertone.

Adrian's jaw tensed visibly before he forced a hollow laugh. Gesturing toward the bubbling pot of Szechuan hotpot, he addressed Ethan with deliberate casualness. "Why don't you share this with the production team? Our chef trained in Spicehaven - his recipes are authentic."

A flicker of recognition lit Vivian's eyes, her lips twitching with suppressed amusement. That infuriating man! One moment he's emotionally torturing her, the next he's remembering her favorite dishes.

The atmosphere lightened as the group interpreted Adrian's gesture as reconciliation. Shoulders relaxed around the table while grateful glances were exchanged. Walter seized the moment to redirect everyone's attention to the feast.

"Please try today's specials. Along with our Spicehaven chef, we've brought in an expert from Mariner's Crest. The seafood arrived fresh this morning - absolutely premium quality."

Penelope hid behind her bowl, peeking over the rim to study Adrian. The man moved with predatory grace, each motion calculated like a carefully choreographed performance of power and refinement. Even while eating, he maintained an aristocratic air that made Sebastian Hartwell pale in comparison.

As she fantasized about a future with someone more dazzling than her celebrity crush, Penelope felt her heart swell with sugary delight. Scenes from countless romance dramas played through her imagination.

Walter proudly produced his private collection of homemade baijiu, the gleam in his eye suggesting its exclusivity. The first sip earned unanimous praise - "Now this is the real deal!" One sycophantic colleague added, "This is Mr. Holloway's personal reserve, made with only the finest ingredients. We're only tasting it today thanks to Mr. Blackwood's presence."

The construction manager, cheeks already flushed, raised his glass with boisterous enthusiasm. "Between these oysters and this exceptional liquor—"

"How about visiting Mirage Lounge tonight? Emberglow County might be small, but we know all the best spots for beautiful company." The suggestion hung in the air.

Adrian's response was glacial. He barely touched his glass before slamming it down, sending liquor droplets spraying across the tablecloth. Conversation died instantly - even the crew members at neighboring tables froze mid-bite.

Vivian remained oblivious to the tension, wholly focused on her meal. The lazy susan spun continuously as hungry hands reached for dish after dish. After a grueling day, she seized this quiet moment to finally eat properly.

To her, Adrian was just another face in the crowd. His moods meant nothing compared to the steaming delicacies before her. What man could possibly compete with perfectly cooked seafood?

Adrian's stormy gaze locked onto Vivian, who continued eating with single-minded determination. His grip tightened around his glass until the tendons in his wrist stood out sharply. The sheer audacity of her indifference - they were practically encouraging him to cheat, and she couldn't be bothered to look up from her plate?

A tempest of fury raged beneath his carefully composed exterior, his expression hardening into something dangerous. The air around him practically crackled with restrained violence.
###Chapter 141

The cheerful mood around the dining table evaporated instantly. All laughter died, replaced by an oppressive silence that made everyone shift uncomfortably in their seats.

Adrian Blackwood leaned back in his chair, his piercing gaze locking onto Walter Holloway. A sardonic smile played on his lips. "Is this what you consider professional conduct?" His voice cut through the air like shards of ice.

Walter's face flushed crimson, torn between embarrassment and defensive pride. "Our business dealings are completely above board," he insisted, his voice strained. "We would never resort to unethical practices. If anyone tried, I'd personally put a stop to it immediately!"

Then, turning back to Adrian, Walter's expression transformed into an ingratiating smile. "Mr. Blackwood, you must understand - these men are simple, hardworking types. They spend their days on construction sites and don't have refined manners. After a few drinks, their tongues get loose with crude jokes. Please forgive their lack of sophistication."

The others quickly caught on, offering profuse apologies. "Indeed, Mr. Blackwood, we meant no offense. We're just rough working men without much education. To make amends, we'll drink three glasses as punishment!"

Without hesitation, even those who had remained silent earlier grabbed their glasses, filling them to the brim with strong liquor before downing them in one go. Their faces grew redder with each swallow.

Adrian remained impassive. After a deliberate pause, he reached for his teacup, taking a slow, measured sip as if savoring the moment.

Only then did the tension ease slightly, allowing the meal to continue - though the earlier boisterous atmosphere never fully returned.

Meanwhile, Penelope Holloway, slightly intoxicated herself, found her admiration for Adrian growing with each passing minute. The alcohol fueled her vivid imagination, painting him as the perfect gentleman - handsome, successful, and honorable. She couldn't let this golden opportunity slip away.

Adrian's abrupt mood shift made Walter think better of bringing up their planned drinking session again. Dinner concluded quickly, with everyone retiring to their rooms for the night.

Alone in his suite, Adrian collapsed onto the sofa. His fingers trembled slightly as he twisted open a bottle of chilled mineral water from the minibar, gulping it down desperately. His shirt hung loosely, the fabric fluttering with each ragged breath.

The cold water did little to quench the fire burning through his veins - a dangerous cocktail of alcohol and something far more primal. His thoughts kept returning to Vivian Hartley by Sapphire Springs, her image crystallizing from the day's hazy memories into sharp, painful clarity. The way the soft light had caressed her porcelain skin, the elegant lines of her silhouette...

Then came the more disturbing memory - Vivian in the bathroom, her bare skin exposed, those wide, startled eyes. That image struck him with shocking intensity, sending an electric jolt through his system.

Adrian was no stranger to attraction. He'd effortlessly brushed off advances from a bikini-clad beauty queen without a second thought. Yet this accidental encounter with Vivian - so vulnerable, so unguarded - had awakened something raw and visceral within him. It was as if some long-dormant switch had been flipped, leaving him hypersensitive to the slightest provocation.

As he wrestled with whether his feelings for Vivian stemmed from genuine emotion or mere physical desire, he couldn't deny the magnetic pull she exerted on him.

The rich food from dinner only seemed to fuel his body's traitorous responses. His mind wandered to stories his friends had told in their youth - tales of first awakenings and explosive passions. Could this overwhelming sensation be his own delayed eruption of youthful desire, finally coming to life with terrifying intensity?
###Chapter 142

The unspoken tension between them still lingered, amplified by the constant comments about how perfectly Vivian and Sebastian complemented each other. Though Adrian knew Vivian only saw Sebastian as a brother figure, an insidious doubt crept into his mind—what if someone who truly understood her essence came along? Since their wedding day, Vivian had become more than just his wife in Adrian's eyes. The devotion in her gaze marked her as his alone.

Yet Vivian had transformed into a radiant, independent woman who commanded every room she entered, no longer existing in Adrian's shadow. The realization pricked at his nerves like thorns. With a sharp turn, Adrian stormed toward the bathroom, hoping the steady stream of water would wash away his growing frustration.

Thirty minutes later, even as Adrian towel-dried his hair, the cold shower did nothing to cool the heat coursing through his veins. The evidence of his arousal remained stubbornly present. Pushing open the bathroom door mechanically, he froze mid-step.

The bedroom, once brightly lit, now lay bathed in the dim glow of a single wall lamp. His corporate instincts kicked in immediately—the business world was a battlefield, and he knew all its treacherous games.

His gaze swept the room, finding it deceptively calm at first glance. Then his eyes locked onto the shadowy corner where a slender figure sat silently on his bed. Relief flickered briefly—just a woman, seemingly harmless.

The memory of tonight's business dinner surfaced, making him suspect this might be some executive's misguided attempt at negotiation. "Get out now!" His command echoed through the room as he reached for the light switch.

"Mr. Blackwood, please—it's me." The reply came in a trembling whisper, laced with nervous anticipation.

As light flooded the room, Penelope scrambled awkwardly off the bed, crossing her arms over her chest in a futile attempt at modesty.

Her sailor-style dress clung to her curves, the flimsy fabric leaving little to the imagination. A deep blush spread across Penelope's cheeks as she lowered her eyes, though she couldn't resist stealing shy glances at Adrian.

Adrian stood motionless, his bare torso glistening with residual water droplets, a towel hanging precariously low on his hips.

The water trails from his damp hair traced paths down his sculpted chest and along the defined ridges of his abdomen, disappearing into the towel's fabric.

The noticeable bulge beneath the towel sent an electric thrill through Penelope, warming her from within.

She barely registered the storm brewing in Adrian's eyes, too focused on one exhilarating realization—the way his body reacted to her presence, the tension in his stance—he couldn't hide his arousal.

Adrian's brows knitted together as he grabbed his robe, shrugging it on with sharp movements.

Penelope's gaze burned with unmistakable invitation, saturating the air with palpable tension.

He moved to the sofa, sinking into its plush depths with practiced grace, and took a deliberate sip of water—a silent command for her to recognize her cue to leave.
###Chapter 143

The alcohol had blurred Penelope's judgment, making her completely misinterpret the sudden chill in the air.

She ducked her head like a startled deer, fingers nervously smoothing her dress before retreating toward the bed.

With a calculated tilt of her chin and honeyed words, she purred, "Adrian, surely a gentleman like you wouldn't make a lady take the first step?"

Across the room, Adrian's expression had turned to stone, all traces of earlier interest replaced by undisguised disgust.

"Out." The single syllable cut through the air like shards of ice.

His command carried more finality than before, leaving no room for negotiation.

Penelope's eyes widened as if struck by lightning, darting between his impassive face and his previously responsive posture that now radiated complete detachment.

The rosy flush of anticipation drained from her cheeks, leaving her pale as she worried her lower lip between her teeth.

The man who had shown fleeting interest now seemed utterly immune to her charms.

His silent rejection spoke louder than any words, the unspoken contempt cutting deeper than any verbal rebuke.

Tears welled in her eyes as humiliation burned through her veins.

He deliberately avoided her gaze, voice steady with dismissal. "Consider today's encounter forgotten. Your father won't hear of this from me."

In their tight-knit community, Penelope was the golden girl - brilliant, talented, and from a respected family, the object of countless admirers at school.

Never had she laid her heart so bare only to be met with such glacial indifference.

Her pulse pounded painfully as she gripped her skirt, summoning courage to voice her confusion. "Why are you treating me this way?"

Adrian paused, slamming his water bottle onto the table with deliberate force. "I'm married." His reply wasn't out of courtesy - he simply saw no reason to prolong their interaction.

Surprise flickered in Penelope's eyes before she scrambled for understanding. "Serena? Is Serena Whitmore your wife?"

Impatience tightened his features.

Adrian stood abruptly, strode to the door and yanked it open, his voice razor-sharp as he began counting. "You have until three. One... Two..."

Fearful of witnesses, Penelope bit her lip, pushed up from the chair and shuffled toward the exit.

At the threshold, curiosity overcame her once more. "Is Serena Whitmore really your wife?"

Just then, a soft thud echoed through the quiet courtyard.
###Chapter 144

Penelope jumped at the sudden noise, deciding against staying to investigate.

She disappeared into the night with hurried steps.

Adrian's gaze snapped toward a shadowy figure illuminated by the garden's soft lighting. His lips twisted into a frosty smile. "Lurking outside my residence at this hour?" he challenged.

Seeing no point in hiding, Vivian abandoned her concealment.

With effortless grace, she bent to retrieve her fallen sketchbook and moved toward Adrian through the moonlit garden.

When she reached him, she casually flipped open the sketchbook. "The room felt stifling. I needed fresh air to work on my screenplay."

"I wasn't aware of your room assignment," she added. "How could I know this was your private retreat?" An uneasy silence settled between them.

Adrian suddenly broke the quiet. "She came to my room voluntarily. It wasn't planned."

Vivian blinked in surprise before understanding dawned - he was explaining Serena's presence.

Though she hadn't caught all of Penelope's words, Serena's name had been unmistakable.

Was this Adrian's attempt to prove his loyalty to Serena? Or a calculated move to win Vivian's sympathy? The contradiction made her nauseous.

Her grip tightened on the sketchbook as she replied coldly, "Your explanations mean nothing to me. You owe me no justifications."

Adrian's anger dissipated when he noticed Vivian's pale complexion. Beads of sweat dotted her forehead, replacing his irritation with concern.

"What's wrong?" he asked, brows knitting together.

Vivian weakly waved him off. "Just hunger pains," she murmured, clutching her stomach as she turned away.

Adrian caught her wrist gently. "The night market's just opening."

She pulled free with surprising strength despite her weakened state. "No need," she said quietly. "I'll get instant noodles from the convenience store."

"I'm hungry too," Adrian declared in his typical uncompromising tone.

Another wave of pain robbed Vivian of energy to argue. She sighed, eyeing his attire. "You're going to the night market like that?" she asked, gesturing weakly at his robe.

"I'll change," he stated matter-of-factly, already guiding her toward the villa as if her protests were irrelevant.

Within minutes, Adrian emerged dressed with car keys in hand, ready to escort them to the bustling night market.
###Chapter 145

The carnival pulsed with its characteristic lively disorder, colorful stall lights painting elongated silhouettes across the tranquil twilight. Though the weekday crowd was thinner than usual, an electric buzz still hummed through the crisp evening air.

Adrian had exchanged his robe for a tailored blazer that perfectly complemented Vivian's blouse. Their coordinated outfits appeared less like a planned ensemble and more like destiny's handiwork.

As he guided her through the bustling fairgrounds, Adrian stopped abruptly at a familiar barbecue stand they'd visited during their first trip to Emberglow County. A woman in her forties and a lanky teenager worked diligently near the entrance, arranging glistening meat skewers beneath swaying paper lanterns.

Adrian's keen eyes focused on a bubbling aquarium filled with darting silver fish. "One order of fish congee," he declared, his tone leaving no room for negotiation.

"Right away, sir," the boy responded, rolling up his sleeves with practiced ease before selecting and preparing a fish with surgical precision.

Vivian tilted her head curiously. "New management?" she inquired casually. "Last time we were here, an elderly gentleman ran this stall."

The woman paused her work, wiping flour-dusted hands on her checkered apron. "That would be my father," she explained warmly. "Doctor's orders - he's supposed to be resting. As for me..." She shrugged with a self-deprecating smile. "Corporate life didn't work out, so here I am keeping the family business alive."

Her gaze flickered between the elegant couple, and her expression softened. "You two must've visited years ago. Vacationing again? You make such a striking pair - revisiting old haunts like this. Truly a couple still deeply in love."

The words "striking pair" seemed to resonate with Adrian in an unexpected way. Without comment, he proceeded to order every premium item on the menu, an uncharacteristic lightness in his demeanor.

Vivian, oblivious to his subtle shift, merely chuckled at the woman's assumption, making no effort to correct her. She turned to locate seating, remembering Adrian's particular nature.

With meticulous care, she sanitized their table and chairs using antiseptic wipes from her purse, her movements precise and deliberate.

Adrian observed her quietly, mesmerized by the way her brow furrowed in concentration. His gaze traced the delicate curve of her cheekbones before joining her at the freshly cleaned table.

The congee arrived first - a masterpiece of creamy white porridge adorned with emerald scallions and sunset-orange carrot slivers. Vivian's stomach growled audibly. The first spoonful transported her; her eyelids fluttered shut as the velvety rice mingled with Sapphire Springs' sweet freshwater fish. Pure bliss radiated from her glowing complexion.

Adrian studied her reaction with quiet fascination. Despite gifting her with diamonds and designer wardrobes, nothing compared to the joy this humble dish evoked. A man who prided himself on reading people, Adrian had to admit his wife of two years remained his greatest enigma - a deceptively simple sonnet that revealed new depths with each reading.

The barbecue arrived in rustic bamboo trays, the air instantly perfumed with smoky chili and earthy cumin. The scene mirrored their first visit - an unexpected moment of unguarded intimacy. Nostalgia softened Vivian's features as she reached eagerly for a prawn skewer.

Adrian's hand intercepted hers mid-reach, claiming the skewer first. As Vivian opened her mouth to protest, his attention caught on her manicure - her usually understated nails now boasted intricate silver cat-eye designs, tiny rhinestone butterflies catching the lantern light like captured fireflies.
###Chapter 146

"Are you seriously going to peel shrimp with those claws?" Adrian scoffed, eyeing Vivian's manicured hands with obvious disapproval. "Do you have a death wish? That polish is practically toxic."

Vivian dramatically fluttered her fingers. "These are organic gel extensions, darling. Completely harmless. Don't they look fabulous?"

He leaned back in his rickety chair, the plastic creaking under his weight. "After all the money I've spent on you, this is what you do with it? Covering your hands in tacky rhinestones like some teenage pop star?"

She resisted the urge to roll her eyes. "When I was playing housekeeper, I didn't have time for manicures. Now that I'm free, I'm enjoying the little luxuries."

The lie came easily. She didn't mention these were for her upcoming role as a socialite - not that it mattered anymore.

Adrian deftly peeled the first shrimp and dropped it into her bowl. "You insisted we didn't need staff. I didn't marry you to turn you into domestic help."

Vivian stared at her lap, the weight of unspoken regrets pressing down. All those compromises she'd made to be the perfect wife now seemed so pointless.

Maybe this was inevitable. They were always too different - like champagne and cheap beer trying to mix in the same glass.

The pile of peeled shrimp grew steadily in her bowl, a bittersweet reminder of their first date here. Back then, she'd been the one peeling while he ate, content just to watch the way his strong hands moved with surprising delicacy.

She mechanically speared a shrimp with her fork. This felt like playing house one last time before their divorce finalized. The shrimp tasted sweet yet strangely hollow, like their marriage - all surface, no substance.

"I'm done," she murmured, setting down her fork.

Adrian popped the last shrimp into his mouth. "Tastes exactly like it did fifteen years ago," he mused.

Vivian froze. They'd only discovered this place last year. Was he thinking of...Serena?

The name hung between them like an uninvited guest. Everything Vivian knew about Serena came from tabloid scraps and whispered gossip.

She forced a smile.

Adrian wiped his hands with a paper napkin, then caught her staring. "What?" he asked, his tone carefully neutral.

Had he brought Serena here? Was this their special spot first? Had those same skilled hands peeled shrimp for another woman with the same tenderness?

The questions swirled like storm clouds. The irony struck her hard - she'd blamed Serena for every crack in their marriage, but the truth was, without Serena, there would have been no marriage at all. That realization left an ache deeper than any betrayal.

Adrian returned from paying the bill, his expression unreadable. "Clear night," he observed. "There's Sapphire Springs near the night market. We could walk by the water."
###Chapter 147

Vivian's mind flashed back to the first time they had shared this moment—stargazing by the ocean's edge. That night, she had dozed off in the car, only to be awakened at sunrise by a vision that stole her breath. The golden sun emerged from the horizon, melting the boundary between sea and sky in a breathtaking display of light.

Those precious moments, she realized with a pang, were likely rituals he had perfected with Serena. Repeated with her. Refined with her. What felt magical to Vivian might have been mere routine for him—echoes of a love story that wasn't hers.

Vivian sidestepped him without meeting his eyes and strode toward the waiting car. Her voice carried frost. "I have a script deadline and lines to rehearse for tomorrow's shoot. Not all of us can afford your leisurely pace, Mr. Blackwood."

Adrian followed in silence, his jaw tightening. In three long strides, he closed the distance between them before she could retreat. His gaze lingered on her lips for a heartbeat before his thumb brushed the corner of her mouth—lingering just a second too long.

"You just devoured the lobster I hand-fed you," he murmured, his velvet voice laced with steel. "And now you turn away? Like a spoiled kitten biting the hand that pets it." His words wrapped around her like silk-lined chains.

Vivian's stomach twisted, the intimate gesture soured by bitter memories. She met his gaze with an icy smile. "Exactly, Mr. Blackwood. In your world, I'm just another pet. You toss treats, I perform tricks. Didn't your business partner drop half a million Sterlings on a show dog last month? Like recognizes like."

Adrian stilled. A flicker of confusion crossed his features before vanishing. This was the second cryptic reference to that story. He'd have Dominic investigate that extravagant dog purchase once they returned to Crestwood.

The streetlamps painted her defiant profile in golden light—chin lifted, eyes blazing. Moonlight transformed her into something ethereal yet untouchable, like a frost-kissed rose. Something primal surged through him, overwhelming reason. Without warning, Adrian captured her lips in a searing kiss.

Vivian froze, shock stealing her breath. This wasn't tenderness—it was possession. The weight of their unresolved tension became suffocating. Unwanted images flooded her mind: Had he kissed Serena with this same fervor? Was she merely reenacting someone else's love story?

The thought churned like acid. Memories surfaced of his legendary devotion to Serena—how he'd resisted every temptation Penelope offered. A crushing truth settled in her chest: she would always be the understudy in his life's drama.

Revulsion erupted like wildfire. Vivian shoved against his chest with all her strength. He countered by cinching an arm around her waist, eliminating all escape. Fury ignited her veins. With deliberate cruelty, she sank her teeth into his lower lip. The metallic tang of blood flooded her mouth as he jerked back with a hissed curse barely contained.

Adrian touched his bleeding lip, examining crimson-stained fingers. A bitter chuckle escaped him. "Ruthless little viper," he murmured, voice glacial.

Vivian's gaze turned arctic. "Look who's talking," she spat. The air between them crackled with unbearable tension.

Her eyes flicked to the idling car. Decision made. Staying would mean defeat.

###Chapter 148

The crisp night air carried Vivian's sharp exhale as she turned away from Adrian's car. "I'll spare you the inconvenience, Mr. Blackwood. I prefer walking." Her heels clicked decisively against the pavement before he could respond, putting distance between them with each determined step.

Emberglow County's winters always announced themselves with icy rains, but tonight's chill held a particularly cruel edge. The biting wind sliced through her wool coat as if it were tissue paper, triggering memories of that other night - when she'd walked away from Seabreeze Villa. The same hollow ache, the same endless road stretching before her.

Vivian's pace gradually slowed until she found herself glancing back instinctively. Adrian's sleek black sedan had already disappeared down a side street, swallowed by the darkness without hesitation. A wry smile touched her lips before vanishing like smoke, leaving behind only the weight in her chest and the sting behind her eyes.

That foolish spark of hope - she couldn't deny its existence, no matter how irrational. What had she expected? That Adrian Blackwood would turn his car around for her? This harsh reality was what she'd been running from for years.

She'd always been the first to apologize, smoothing over conflicts before they could escalate. It had created an illusion of stability, of control. Now, standing her ground, she saw how fragile that illusion truly was.

Moonlight painted the world in silver, but Vivian found no comfort in its glow. Forcing her thoughts away from the emptiness inside, she focused instead on her surroundings. Her gaze drifted between shadowed trees as her mind automatically returned to her script's problems.

The production company's outline was riddled with plot holes. Though she hadn't used her pen name and this was just a commercial drama, perfectionism drove her to refine every detail.

So absorbed was she in professional calculations that Vivian completely missed her turn toward the Harbor Grand Hotel. When she finally looked up, unfamiliar storefronts surrounded her. Realizing she was lost in Emberglow County, she reached for her phone - only to find her pocket empty.

She'd left it in Adrian's car. A dimly lit convenience store beckoned from the corner. Steeling herself, Vivian hurried toward it, hoping to find directions.

Meanwhile, at the Dawson residence, an entirely different scene unfolded. Natasha lounged across a designer sofa, her silk pajamas shimmering as her fingers flew across her phone screen. Richard sat nearby, half-watching financial news detailing Crestwood's struggling economy. Small businesses were folding daily, and even Dawson Enterprises felt the strain.

"Darling," Richard paused the television, "how's the Sterling situation progressing? Our family's future hinges on this connection. If it falls through—"

"Don't be such a pessimist," Daphne interrupted, gliding into the room with her facial mask glistening. She settled beside Natasha with practiced ease. "Natasha has everything handled. Your worrying is unnecessary."

"Mom always understands me," Natasha purred, leaning into Daphne with theatrical affection. She brandished her phone like a trophy. "Maxwell's already in Emberglow County. In that provincial backwater, securing the Sterling family's cooperation will be child's play."

Richard exhaled, some tension leaving his shoulders though caution remained in his eyes. "Good. But remember, Natasha, you're not getting any younger. It's time to consider marriage seriously. If you're close to Maxwell, perhaps look within his circle? A woman's greatest asset is her charm."
###Chapter 149

Natasha's lips twisted into a scowl, her annoyance barely contained. "You expect me to settle for one of those entitled playboys? Not happening. I have taste."

"Precisely," Daphne added, her voice laced with contempt. "Our Natasha is meant for someone extraordinary."

Richard glanced between his wife and daughter, suspicion darkening his features. "You're keeping secrets from me. Have you already chosen someone?"

Natasha merely flashed a mischievous grin. "That's my little secret for now!"

Outside the Mirage Lounge, two men staggered toward the curb, their arms slung over each other's shoulders like sailors weathering a storm. After downing countless beers, their stomachs protested like overfilled water balloons. With the restroom line stretching endlessly, they stumbled outside, finding refuge beneath the gnarled branches of an ancient maple.

In Emberglow County, where rumors spread faster than wildfire, such behavior was commonplace after a night of heavy drinking. The stockier man had just finished relieving himself when his bleary eyes caught a distant silhouette. He froze mid-motion, fingers still clutching his belt, and elbowed his companion sharply.

"Damn, look at that! She's a knockout!"

The taller man, words already slurring, began to dismiss him. "At this hour? You're hallucinating again—" His voice died as his gaze followed.

His jaw slackened. "Holy hell! When did Emberglow get supermodels?"

Vivian stood bathed in the flickering glow of a streetlamp, her silhouette effortlessly arresting. Her endless legs seemed to defy physics, while her razor-sharp cheekbones took on an otherworldly allure under the erratic lighting—equal parts enigma and magnetism.

The two men, scarcely believing their luck, hastily straightened their rumpled shirts and swaggered toward her, their grins oozing with predatory intent.

"Evening, beautiful," one slurred, his voice thick with false charm. "Aren't you lonely out here all by yourself? Let us buy you a drink. Anything you want, darling—our treat."

Vivian, noting the unmistakable hunger in their eyes, pretended not to hear. She pivoted sharply on her stilettos and quickened her pace. She'd barely taken three steps before they intercepted her, blocking her path with alcohol-fueled bravado.

"Hold up, sweetheart."

"What's the rush? We're just being friendly," the taller one sneered, his breath reeking of hops and stale tobacco.

Suppressing a gag, Vivian lifted her chin defiantly. "My fiancé's waiting for me just around the corner."

The stocky man scanned the desolate street, his smirk widening. "Really? This whole block's nothing but condemned buildings and empty lots. You're too classy for some construction worker. Who is he—the ghost of Christmas future?"

Before Vivian could retort, they each seized an arm, their laughter slithering through the night like venom. "Relax, gorgeous," one crooned. "We're important people here. Spend some time with us, and you'll be thanking your lucky stars."
###Chapter 150

Adrian Blackwood's knuckles turned white as he gripped the steering wheel, the storm inside him mirroring the gathering clouds overhead. His jaw clenched so tight it could have cracked walnuts. When he slammed the car door at the Harbor Grand Hotel, the sound echoed through the parking lot like a gunshot.

The moment he entered his suite, the scent of jasmine assaulted his senses - a cruel reminder of Vivian Hartley sitting on his bed just hours earlier, her words still stinging like salt in an open wound. He ripped off his tie with a frustrated growl.

Within minutes, he was back at the front desk, rapping his signet ring against the marble counter with enough force to make the receptionist jump. "I need another room. Now."

The young woman behind the desk - clearly new - nearly dropped her clipboard. She recognized him instantly from the staff memos: Adrian Blackwood, VIP guest, treat like visiting royalty. Her cheeks flushed as she took in his chiseled features. Even scowling, he looked like he'd stepped off a magazine cover.

"Right away, Mr. Blackwood," she stammered, fingers flying across her keyboard. "We have our Sapphire Suite available on the top floor." She grabbed a keycard, smoothing her skirt as she came around the desk. "If you'll follow me..."

As they walked down the hallway, the skies opened with a thunderous crack. Rain lashed against the windows like angry fingers.

The receptionist giggled nervously. "Perfect timing, sir. Another minute and you'd have been drenched."

Adrian didn't respond. His gaze fixed on the downpour, but his mind was miles away - with Vivian. She'd been wearing just that thin blouse when he'd last seen her. If she got caught in this storm... His stomach twisted at the thought of her falling ill again.

"Here we are, Mr. Blackwood," the receptionist announced, stopping before an ornate door. She swiped the keycard with a flourish. "The Sapphire Suite. If there's anything else you - "

But Adrian's attention had snagged on the door across the hall. "Has the guest in that room returned?" he interrupted, voice carefully neutral.

The receptionist checked her tablet. "I've been on duty since six, and no one's come through except you." She started to ask about room preferences, but Adrian was already striding back down the hallway toward the elevators.

"Damn it all!"

Outside the dilapidated bar in Emberglow County, one of the thugs cursed as the rain came down in sheets. His grip tightened on Vivian's arm, fingers digging into her flesh like steel traps.

Emberglow might as well have been another century compared to Crestwood. The bar's flickering neon sign barely illuminated the potholed parking lot, let alone provided any semblance of security. No cameras. No witnesses. Just half-demolished buildings and skeletal construction sites that changed hands more often than poker chips.

Vivian knew reporting this would be pointless. The local police had bigger problems than a celebrity getting roughed up in some backwater dive.

Her struggles grew more desperate as the men dragged her toward an unmarked van, its windshield wipers fighting a losing battle against the storm. The cold rain mixed with hot tears on her cheeks as realization dawned - no one was coming to save her this time.
###Chapter 151

Vivian's scream tore through the night, raw with desperation, as she clung to the last shreds of hope.

Her cry was instantly silenced. One of the men pressed a damp cloth over her mouth and nose. The sharp, chemical sting flooded her senses, turning her limbs to lead. Her voice died in her throat, reduced to a ragged whisper.

They dragged her forward, their rough hands roaming her body with revolting familiarity. Every touch sent waves of revulsion through her.

"Pretty thing like you shouldn’t be walking alone at night," the first man sneered, his breath hot against her ear. "Looking for trouble, were you? Play nice, and maybe we’ll make it worth your while."

"Dressed like that? You were begging for attention," the second taunted, lips curling into a cruel smirk. "Don’t bother pretending. By the time we’re done, you’ll be thanking us."

Her vision blurred as they hauled her toward a rusted van, its dented frame half-hidden in the alley’s gloom.

The door screeched open. One of them shoved her inside without care.

Her soaked blouse clung to her skin, outlining every curve. The men’s hungry gazes burned into her, their excitement undimmed by the rain soaking their clothes.

Vivian’s skull cracked against the opposite door. White-hot pain exploded behind her eyes.

She bit down hard on her tongue, the metallic tang of blood sharp on her lips. The pain cleared her fogged mind just in time to see one of them lunge.

Instinct took over. She lashed out with her foot—

A direct hit.

The man howled, doubling over. His companion snarled and seized her ankle, yanking her forward. A brutal backhand sent her sprawling across the seat.

Her cheek throbbed. Through the haze, she spotted two beer bottles wedged beneath the cushion.

Before they could grab her again, she snatched one and swung.

No shattering glass. No dramatic escape.

Just a weak, futile strike.

The bottle was wrenched from her grip.

In moments like these, you either fight hard enough to scare them off—or you don’t fight at all.

Vivian’s struggle only made them angrier.

The van door slammed shut.

Darkness swallowed her.
###Chapter 152

Vivian's face drained of all color as the two thugs loomed over her.

What unspeakable things did they have planned?

In that paralyzing moment, only one name surfaced through her terror: Adrian.

He was her only lifeline in this nightmare.

Would Adrian notice her disappearance? Could he reach her before it was too late?

The thought of him was the sole anchor keeping her from drowning in fear.

"Stupid girl!" The men's tempers flared.

One brute yanked open the van door, his filthy hands tearing at her silk blouse.

CRASH!

A whiskey bottle exploded against the attacker's skull, spraying blood and glass across the vehicle's interior.

"Miss, are you hurt?" A calm voice cut through the storm, its composed tone surreal amidst the violence.

The wounded assailant was dragged away, revealing a face that made Vivian's breath catch.

Maxwell adjusted his designer glasses, his immaculate appearance contrasting sharply with the gruesome scene. "Vivian? My God, is that you?" His aristocratic features twisted in genuine alarm.

In one fluid motion, he shrugged off his cashmere overcoat and wrapped it around her trembling shoulders.

His gaze flickered downward for half a heartbeat - just long enough to register the way her soaked blouse clung to her curves - before snapping back up with practiced decorum.

"Let's get you up," he murmured, offering a steady hand.

The instant she was upright, Vivian recoiled from his touch, clutching the coat like a shield.

Maxwell remained unflappable, his smile radiating nothing but concern - a stark contrast to the scandalous rumors that dogged his reputation.

"Why are you here?" Vivian demanded, her voice raw.

"Pure coincidence," Maxwell replied smoothly. "I spotted these brutes lurking about and suspected foul play. Never imagined I'd find you of all people."

The explanation rang hollow. Meeting in this remote corner of Emberglow County, miles from their usual haunts in Crestwood, stretched believability.

Suspicion coiled in Vivian's gut.

Was this a staged rescue? Had Maxwell's carefully laid plans gone awry?

One thing was certain - her peril had been all too real.
###Chapter 153

The cocktail of drugs in her system made her knees buckle and her vision swim.

Trapped between the car door and his imposing frame, Vivian's heartbeat thundered in her ears at the prospect of being isolated with him.

Gritting her teeth against the dizziness, she forced steadiness into her voice. "I appreciate your assistance. I just got lost looking for a late-night snack. May I use your phone to contact my production team?"

Maxwell gave a slow shake of his head. "Unnecessary. The authorities are already en route. They'll require your statement before you leave."

Right on schedule, police sirens pierced the night's silence, their strobing lights painting the wet pavement in alternating crimson and cobalt.

He retreated a step, motioning for Vivian to exit the vehicle. Behind him stood an immobile row of security personnel holding umbrellas that did little against the downpour.

Nearby, two men lay groaning in the mud, thoroughly restrained and drenched, their expressions a mixture of intoxication and dawning horror.

Vivian blinked rapidly, stunned that Maxwell had actually summoned law enforcement.

Some tension left her shoulders, yet threads of doubt still wove through her thoughts. Was this truly coincidence, or some elaborate scheme of his?

Studying Maxwell's composed features, her long-held resentment faltered. Though they moved in the same elite circles, they'd remained strangers until this moment.

Her animosity had always stemmed from Richard's relentless push for a business marriage and the unsavory whispers surrounding the Sterling heir.

But in this rain-slicked moment of clarity, she recognized Maxwell had never personally wronged her. The arranged engagement had been Natasha and Richard's political maneuver, not his design.

Perhaps they were both pawns in others' games.

"Back at it again, boys?" An officer sighed as he cuffed the prone men. "Attempted assault? That's not something we can overlook this time."

"You're facing real consequences now."

During her statement, Vivian learned the full picture.

The officers explained the assailants were jobless locals who'd blown their拆迁 compensation on liquor and gambling, becoming regulars at the precinct for minor offenses.

Tonight marked just another disastrous choice in their downward spiral.

"That was some potent sedative they slipped you," a kind-faced officer noted. "You'll feel groggy for hours, but no permanent damage. We'll get you to the hospital for fluids—you should recover by morning."

"Shall we notify your family?"

With the immediate threat neutralized and police presence providing security, Vivian's earlier panic subsided.

The fleeting wish for Adrian's appearance dissolved—when had that man ever been her knight in shining armor?
###Chapter 154

The film crew were merely coworkers, not close friends. Bothering them with personal matters seemed inappropriate.

"That's quite all right," Vivian murmured. "Since it's nothing serious, I'll just take a taxi home after the IV."

Before she could leave, Maxwell approached again, his voice steady as always. "Let me accompany you to the hospital. It's no inconvenience."

Though grateful for his kindness, Vivian had no intention of growing closer to him.

She shook her head. "That won't be necessary, Mr. Sterling. Thank you for everything tonight."

Undeterred by her polite refusal, Maxwell gave a faint smile. "My security team got drenched tonight and seem to be coming down with colds. They'll need IVs too."

"Might as well stay together." Nearby, a female officer who'd been observing their exchange chimed in cheerfully, "It's always better to have company in situations like these. A familiar face makes everything easier." Cornered, Vivian forced a small smile. "Very well then. Thank you, Mr. Sterling."

At the hospital, Vivian felt completely disconnected from her own body. Her legs shook with every step, and she barely made it to the hospital bed with support from two officers. The medication made her drowsy, but fear kept her alert.

Fumbling for a solution, she borrowed a phone from one officer. Lydia wasn't in Emberglow County, and aside from Sebastian, the only person in the crew she somewhat trusted was Isabella Thornton, the makeup artist. Isabella was notorious for her late nights, often scrolling through social media until sunrise.

The phone barely rang once before Isabella's voice came through. "Hello?"

"Isabella, it's Vivian," she whispered. "Could you come to the hospital? I... I could really use some company."

Isabella's tone shifted immediately, laced with concern. "What happened? Are you hurt? Should I call Sebastian—"

"No!" Vivian interrupted, panic rising. "Please don't tell anyone. It's nothing serious. I just... don't want to be alone right now."

"Alright," Isabella said softly but firmly. "Send me the address. I'll be there as fast as I can."

Vivian quickly texted the location before returning the phone. She leaned back as the nurse prepped her arm for the IV. Her skin was translucent, blue veins clearly visible beneath. Just as the nurse was about to insert the needle, the door opened, revealing Maxwell holding a plastic bag.

"I noticed you were still in wet clothes," Maxwell said gently. "Didn't want you catching a chill, so I found something for you to change into."

"Most shops were closed, so hospital pajamas will have to do." His tailored navy suit accentuated his refined features, every movement exuding quiet confidence.

The simple gesture earned Maxwell admiring glances from nurses and officers alike. Soft whispers circulated among them.

Maxwell's lips curved into a subtle, self-satisfied smile. He clearly enjoyed their reactions, but his attention remained fixed on Vivian.
###Chapter 155

The nurse smiled kindly. "How considerate of you. There aren't many shops open at this late hour."

Vivian managed a faint smile. Refusing would appear rude, so she whispered, "Thank you, Mr. Sterling."

Adrian gave a gracious nod before addressing the nurse. "Would you assist her with changing?"

Before the nurse could take the bag, the atmosphere in the room changed abruptly. A commanding figure strode through the doorway, his presence immediately dominating the space.

"Thank you for your assistance today, Mr. Sterling. However, it's getting late, and my wife needs rest. We'll return the favor another time." Adrian's voice was polite yet carried an unmistakable edge of dismissal.

Vivian's breath hitched as she looked up at him. His sudden appearance startled her, yet an unexpected wave of relief washed over her.

He still wore the light jacket from earlier that evening, his posture radiating quiet authority that had nothing to do with his attire.

Without any need for words or dramatic gestures, Adrian effortlessly overshadowed Maxwell in the room.

Maxwell's confident smile faltered momentarily before he recovered. "Of course," he said smoothly, extending the bag toward Adrian. "I'll leave her in your care then. Please look after Ms. Hartley."

Adrian didn't reach for the bag, his gaze steady and unyielding. Towering over Maxwell, his subtle disdain was impossible to miss.

This clearly unsettled Maxwell, though he maintained his composure.

The tension was broken when Ethan hurried in, arms laden with multiple shopping bags. His sharp eyes quickly assessed the situation.

"I've brought clothes for Mrs. Blackwood," Ethan announced, moving to Adrian's side. "The selection was limited, but I got the best available. I hope they'll do," he explained to Vivian with an apologetic tone.

The clothes Ethan presented—while not mainstream luxury brands—were clearly carefully selected. His efficiency and attention to detail made Maxwell's simple hospital pajamas seem almost laughable in comparison.

An awkward silence fell over the room. Maxwell's earlier thoughtful gesture now appeared inadequate. The contrast between their capabilities was stark.

Maxwell's smile tightened as he placed his bag on a nearby chair. "I'll stop by to check on you tomorrow, Vivian," he said casually.

Vivian, however, had already made her decision. Her voice came out clear and firm. "That won't be necessary, Mr. Sterling. I'll be going home with my husband after the treatment."

The word "husband" slipped from Vivian's lips like a gentle spring breeze—soft yet unmistakable. To Adrian, it felt like sunlight breaking through storm clouds—warm and comforting. An unusual contentment softened his normally guarded expression.

Taking a bag from Ethan, Adrian settled into the chair beside the bed. His lips curved into a tender smile that could melt the coldest heart. "Let me help you change," he murmured, his voice low and intimate, the perfect picture of a devoted spouse.

Vivian barely suppressed an eye roll. If this man ever decided to act professionally, she thought wryly, he'd sweep every acting award with performances like this.
###Chapter 156

Adrian reached to unbutton her blouse but froze, casting a sharp glance over his shoulder. "If you'll excuse us, my wife needs privacy to change," he murmured, the words meant for Maxwell. Yet his stormy gaze, filled with a tenderness that made Vivian's chest ache, remained locked on her face.

Maxwell's lips twisted into that polished society smile, but his eyes gleamed like honed steel. His voice dripped with poisoned honey as he broke the charged silence. "Mr. Blackwood, you never fail to impress. Even while standing on the precipice of divorce, you perform the devoted husband so convincingly."

Adrian's fingers moved with deliberate care as he brushed a damp curl from Vivian's forehead. "Darling," he murmured, voice low and intimate, "when exactly did we discuss divorce?"

Battling the tempest inside, Vivian forced a brittle smile toward Maxwell. "Mr. Sterling," she said evenly, "you shouldn't believe everything you hear." Despite her controlled tone, the pallor of her skin betrayed her.

Sweat-slicked strands clung to her temples, and her usually vibrant eyes shimmered with quiet despair. Against his will, Maxwell remembered her vulnerability—her whispered pleas, the tremble of her soft lips, her futile struggles. Heat crawled up his neck, and he tugged at his collar with restless fingers.

"So it's just idle gossip then," he remarked, tone carefully neutral. "I'll take my leave." His gaze lingered on Vivian, heavy with unspoken hunger. He'd been too hasty before, his impatience driving her straight into Adrian's arms. But two years had only deepened his obsession, sharpening his need to claim her. This time, he could be patient.

Without another word, he turned on his heel and strode away, his exit leaving the room thick with unvoiced threats.

The moment Maxwell disappeared, the fragile warmth drained from Vivian's expression, replaced by glacial detachment. Adrian misread the shift, his attention snapping to the angry mark on her cheek. His eyes darkened, tenderness giving way to smoldering rage. Her porcelain skin, meant to be cherished, bore the imprint of violence that should never have touched her.

When news of the attack reached him, he'd ordered a ruthless investigation, uncovering every crime those street rats had ever committed. He'd ensured they'd rot behind bars for at least a decade. Yet even that couldn't quench the firestorm inside him. The image of their filthy hands on her made his vision swim with crimson fury.

His frustration erupted as he thrust fresh clothes into her arms. "You're not a child, Vivian," he snapped, voice edged with steel. "Yet you behave like one, running off in a tantrum without thought for consequences. If something worse had happened—" He cut himself off, the unspoken possibilities hanging between them like a guillotine.

Vivian's eyes widened, disbelief warring with fresh pain. Tears threatened, but she swallowed them back.

When she'd stood at the edge of that abyss, staring into true horror, Adrian hadn't been there. Now that danger had passed, he returned not to comfort but to chastise. His words crushed something fragile inside her. She wanted to scream, to shatter, but exhaustion—of body and soul—left her hollow.

Turning her face away, her voice emerged cold and quiet. "If something worse had happened, I'd simply be dead." The words fell like stones, exposing the yawning loneliness beneath.

The room's atmosphere turned arctic. Nearby officers and nurses exchanged uneasy glances, struggling to reconcile the couple's earlier show of affection with this sudden hostility.
###Chapter 157

"Vivian?" Isabella's voice trembled with concern, but when her eyes landed on Adrian sitting intimately close to Vivian, shock replaced her worry. The words she'd prepared died on her lips as the room filled with palpable tension.

"You should rest now. We may require your statement later for more details." The officer spoke hurriedly when he noticed someone approaching, then quickly excused himself.

The nurse reappeared at the doorway, her tone clipped. "I'll be back with your injection after you change." With that, she vanished down the corridor.

Now only Vivian, Adrian, Ethan, and Isabella remained in the suddenly too-small hospital room.

Isabella forced a nervous laugh, stumbling over her words. "M-Mr. Blackwood, what an unexpected... pleasure to see you here."

Adrian barely glanced at her, his cold dismissal obvious to everyone but Isabella herself.

Vivian noticed the calculating gleam in Isabella's eyes as they darted between her and Adrian. Clutching her hospital gown tighter, Vivian turned to Isabella. "Could you help me change, please?"

Then she leveled a pointed look at Adrian. "Mr. Blackwood, would you mind giving us some privacy?"

Memories of how he'd just dealt with Maxwell flashed through Adrian's mind, fueling his irritation. Exhaustion lined his face as he recalled pulling every string, searching relentlessly through the night to find her. And now, without so much as a thank you, she was dismissing him like a servant.

His lips curled into a sardonic smile. "There's nothing I haven't seen before."

"Really, what's the problem?" His retort exploded like a shockwave, visibly rattling Isabella.

Isabella's eyes widened, her breath catching at the scandalous implication. So Vivian had stolen Serena's wealthy benefactor! This explained the bitter feud between them - they were romantic rivals!

Vivian's expression remained unreadable as marble. "If my humiliation amuses you, Mr. Blackwood, by all means enjoy the show."

Her words reduced herself to mere entertainment.

Adrian scoffed derisively, rising abruptly. "Your words don't offend me - they only reveal how little you value yourself."

Vivian remembered the thugs' cruel accusations about her virtue, their victim-blaming rhetoric. Now the man she once loved was echoing those same poisonous judgments.

Her smile turned bitter. "Save your concern, Mr. Blackwood. We both know Serena can do no wrong in your eyes."

Adrian's face hardened as he strode toward the exit without another word.
###Chapter 158

"Mrs.—" Ethan hesitated briefly, glancing at Isabella before carefully choosing his words, deliberately avoiding "Mrs. Blackwood." Turning to Vivian, he explained, "Mr. Blackwood didn’t mean to come across that way. He spent the entire night searching for you and personally instructed the police to investigate thoroughly. His concern for you might have made his words sharper than intended—"

Adrian’s voice, thick with irritation, cut through the air before he’d even fully left the room. "Ethan, if you plan on staying at the hospital, don’t bother coming back."

"Mr. Blackwood struggles with expressing his emotions. Don’t focus on his words—pay attention to his actions," Ethan added quickly, setting down another bag before darting out to catch up with Adrian.

Vivian leaned back against her pillow, unfazed by Ethan’s reassurances. As Adrian’s closest confidant, Ethan was naturally inclined to paint him in the best light possible. Even though they were still technically married, and Adrian was merely fulfilling his obligations, Vivian felt nothing but detachment.

Isabella stepped forward to help Vivian change into fresh clothes. As she did, Vivian confided in her. "I didn’t have anyone else to turn to here, so I had to trouble you. It’s not exactly a dignified situation, so I’d appreciate it if you kept this between us."

Isabella nodded eagerly, raising three fingers beside her cheek in a solemn vow. "I swear on my life, not a single word about today will leave my lips!"

After her promise, she hesitated, curiosity flickering in her gaze. Vivian offered a faint smile. "If there’s anything you’re wondering about, go ahead and ask."

Isabella leaned in slightly, lowering her voice. "Are you and Mr. Blackwood… involved?"

Vivian paused before answering. "No, it’s complicated between us, but I expect it’ll all be resolved soon."

Watching Vivian’s earlier indifference toward Adrian, Isabella quickly assumed he had tried to keep her as a mistress—an offer Vivian had clearly rejected. Her admiration for Vivian deepened instantly.

She nodded firmly, her voice gentle but resolute. "I understand. Don’t worry, your secret’s safe with me."

A pensive expression crossed Vivian’s face, a slight crease forming between her brows.

She considered correcting the misunderstanding, but the nurse returned before she could speak. Exhausted and overwhelmed, Vivian surrendered to the nurse’s care, allowing the IV to be administered. Soon, she drifted into a restless sleep.

Her dreams were turbulent, haunted by shadows of recent events—Adrian’s cold stare, Serena’s smug smirk.

When she woke, the IV had been removed, and Isabella was sound asleep in the neighboring bed. The sterile, empty room amplified the chill settling over her, and a wave of profound sadness left her feeling more isolated than ever.

The next day, Vivian finally stirred at noon. After returning from the hospital, she had texted the director to request leave before collapsing into bed, buried beneath the blankets.

A sharp knock at the door jolted her awake. She groaned, pressing a hand to her temple as she squinted at her phone. Noon already.

"Vivian? Are you there?" Sebastian’s familiar voice carried through the door, laced with concern. "I brought you lunch. Pumpkin millet porridge and chicken soup—free-range, no seasoning. It’s good for recovery."
###Chapter 159

The morning had barely begun when Adrian arrived on set, only to discover Vivian was sick. His focus shattered, he stumbled through scenes he normally aced in one take. By noon, he hadn’t touched his own lunch, too busy packing something light and nutritious for her.

She stretched toward the door, but a glance in the mirror froze her. Her face—once elegant and refined—was puffy, the faint outline of a slap still visible. It felt like a brand of shame. The thought of Sebastian seeing her like this made her chest constrict.

Her fingers hovered over the blanket before she pulled it tighter around herself. Instead of opening the door, she sent him a quick text: "I’m okay, just exhausted. Not up for visitors. You should go back."

Outside, Sebastian frowned at the message. The clipped tone only deepened his concern.

He stared at the door, debating whether to push further, when a voice interrupted his thoughts.

He turned to see Isabella at the top of the stairs, cheeks flushed from the climb. She tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear, her jacket sleeves rolled up haphazardly, and walked toward him.

"Perfect timing!" he exclaimed, relief softening his expression. "I brought lunch for Vivian, but she says she’s too weak to get up. Could you take it in for me?"

Isabella hesitated, a faint blush coloring her cheeks before she nodded. "Of course."

Sebastian handed her the bag with a grateful smile, then turned back toward his room, his mood noticeably lighter.

Isabella steadied herself and knocked softly. "Vivian, it’s Isabella."

Before the door could open, Ethan appeared from the opposite hallway, arms laden with bags.

Isabella offered him a polite smile. "You’re Mr. Blackwood’s assistant, right?"

"That’s correct. Ethan Caldwell," he replied with a courteous nod.

"Isabella Thornton," she introduced herself, awkwardly recalling the whispers from last night.

Vivian opened the door just as they finished exchanging pleasantries. Her gaze flicked between them, assessing the scene.

Ethan, who had been Adrian’s assistant for years, was usually a quiet presence—barely noticeable. But up close, he was surprisingly striking, with sharp, refined features.

Isabella, in contrast, had a bold, arresting beauty, her long hair swept into a high ponytail, eyes bright and expressive.

Her vibrant energy clashed intriguingly with Ethan’s composed, understated aura.

Isabella lifted the lunch bag Sebastian had given her, shaking it slightly. "Sebastian sent this for you."

"This is from Mr. Blackwood," Ethan stepped forward, presenting his own bag. "Along with some ointment."

Before Vivian could respond, he added smoothly, "The ointment was overnighted to reduce swelling quickly. Mr. Blackwood is concerned about your on-camera appearance. He takes your career very seriously."

A flicker of guilt crossed Ethan’s face as he recalled Adrian’s instructions—just deliver it, no unnecessary explanations.

But he couldn’t help himself.

Not when Vivian looked like this.
###Chapter 160

Vivian hesitated before accepting the bag, murmuring a quiet "Thank you."

Ethan looked visibly relieved, giving an approving nod before offering some comforting words and turning to leave.

"So what do you think of Ethan?" Vivian asked casually, studying Isabella with curious eyes.

"He seems decent enough," Isabella replied with a nonchalant shrug.

"Just decent?"

Vivian arched an eyebrow but didn't press further, her attention already shifting to the food Ethan had delivered.

Isabella, however, seemed more intrigued by examining the contents. The porcelain soup container was exquisite and substantial, radiating understated elegance.

"This definitely isn't from some ordinary takeout place!" Isabella exclaimed, her face brightening. "Vivian, Mr. Blackwood treats you exceptionally well. A wealthy, gorgeous CEO pampering you? That's every girl's fantasy."

Vivian's lips curved into a faint, knowing smile. "These gestures mean nothing to someone with his resources. For men like him, it's the easiest way to show attention."

Isabella paused, considering her words. "You're right," she said thoughtfully. "Though I heard when Serena was ill, he personally carried her to the hospital and stayed by her bedside the entire time. Even with all his devotion, he still couldn't escape being... well, typical male behavior."

She had meant to generalize, but as a particular face flashed through her mind, her words trailed off.

Looking at Vivian with sudden admiration, Isabella added, "You're so level-headed. No wonder Sebastian respects you so much."

Vivian forced a smile, changing the subject. "Have you eaten? There's too much here for one person. Join me?"

Was she truly level-headed? If she were, she wouldn't have allowed herself to remain in such a precarious, humiliating situation. If she were truly sensible, she wouldn't have hesitated when their contractual year ended.

After lunch, Isabella left for work, leaving Vivian alone in the quiet room. Fortunately, the sedative she'd been given was mild, leaving no lasting effects. Between hydration, rest, and a satisfying meal, she quickly regained her usual energy.

After a revitalizing shower, she changed into a simple yet elegant long-sleeved nightgown. Settling against the headboard, she retrieved the Ambermyst script and began rehearsing her lines with quiet intensity. Seeing the story she'd written through an actress's perspective brought fresh insights, as if she were uncovering hidden layers within her own creation.

Time passed swiftly when immersed in creative work. Before she noticed, daylight had surrendered to twilight's deep hues. The rhythmic patter of heavy rain outside enveloped the room in cozy isolation, making it feel like a solitary island adrift in a stormy sea.

Her concentration was broken by a knock at the door. Assuming it was Isabella or perhaps Sebastian bringing dinner, she padded to the door still holding the script, her mind elsewhere. But when she opened it, she was met with an entirely unexpected sight.

Adrian stood there, rain-drenched and intense. Her brow furrowed as she lowered the script, blurting out, "What are you doing here?"
###Chapter 161

Adrian stood bare-chested in the doorway, his damp white shirt clinging to every defined muscle like liquid silk. A single raised eyebrow accentuated his sharp features as his voice cut through the humid air. "Were you expecting someone else?"

Before the tension could thicken, Ethan materialized in the frame, his broad shoulders nearly filling the space. "Mrs. Hartley, Mr. Blackwood sustained injuries from a falling tree branch and requires medical attention."

Vivian's eyes darted to the streaks of dried mud staining Adrian's shoulder, her lips thinning into a disapproving line. Without speaking, she pivoted sharply toward the bathroom cabinet, her heels clicking against the hardwood with military precision. Adrian followed uninvited, his presence expanding to fill her private space.

She hesitated mid-step when she sensed him crossing the threshold. Protesting now would be pointless - the damage was done. All she wanted was to treat his wounds and send him packing.

"I'll retrieve the documents from Mr. Holloway," Ethan announced from the doorway. Adrian acknowledged with a barely perceptible tilt of his chin. Turning to Vivian, Ethan added, "Please see to Mr. Blackwood's injuries," before shutting the door with finality, effectively silencing any objections.

Adrian made himself at home on the edge of her bed, his sprawling posture radiating entitlement. His long legs stretched casually, as if claiming territory in her sanctuary. Vivian refused to indulge his arrogance.

With calculated precision, she lobbed the ointment toward him. "Your arms appear functional enough," she remarked coolly. Dragging a chair to the far side of the room, she immersed herself in script revisions, pointedly ignoring his existence. The pages became her shield, her gaze never wavering from the typed lines.

A shadow of displeasure darkened Adrian's striking features. His piercing gaze remained fixed on her as he began undoing his shirt buttons with deliberate slowness - each movement a provocation, each unfastened button a challenge. Shrugging out of the garment, he applied the salve himself, his jaw tightening with barely restrained frustration.

Out of the corner of her eye, Vivian caught glimpses of his sculpted shoulders and the tantalizing V of muscles leading downward. She jerked her attention back to the script, mentally scolding herself. The world overflowed with attractive men, she reminded herself sharply.

Falling for her soon-to-be ex-husband's charms would be the height of foolishness. Whether from the relentless storm or Adrian's oppressive presence, irritation prickled beneath her skin. She'd left Seabreeze Villa to sever complicated ties, yet here she stood, entangled once more.

"I can't reach my back," Adrian declared abruptly, shattering the silence. His challenging stare dared her to refuse.

Her gaze flickered to the angry red marks trailing down his shoulder blades. The wound, caked with mud and haphazardly applied ointment, looked ripe for infection.

"You didn't clean it first?" she snapped. "With debris like that, you're inviting sepsis, not healing."

He opened his mouth, likely to argue, but she was already moving. The water dispenser gurgled as she filled a bowl, her every movement radiating irritation. The only sounds were the rain's relentless patter and her clipped footsteps.

Kneeling beside the bed, Vivian worked with clinical efficiency, dabbing at his injuries with sterile gauze. Her touch was featherlight yet left trails of warmth wherever it traveled.

###Chapter 162

Adrian's gaze shifted downward, settling on Vivian's leg propped against the bed's edge. From this angle, the scars that once marred her skin were nearly invisible. A quiet relief washed over him, prompting him to murmur, "You can barely see them anymore."

She remained silent, her fingers working the ointment into her skin with clinical precision. When finished, she rose abruptly, thrusting the tube toward him like a challenge. "Done. Take this and have Ethan assist you next time."

Before she could retreat, Adrian's arm snaked out, pulling her against his chest with a force that stole her breath.

His whisper curled around her like smoke. "Why do you keep running from me?"

Vivian found herself trapped against Adrian's rain-dampened shirt, the unexpected warmth of his body sending shockwaves through her system. She tilted her head back, meeting his piercing stare - that same predatory look that once unraveled her defenses, that once coaxed vulnerable confessions from her lips. But no longer.

What once tethered her to him had eroded, leaving only brittle resistance in its wake.

Her voice turned arctic. "Mr. Blackwood, your memory fails you. I've made myself clear - I have zero interest in my almost ex-husband."

She twisted in his grasp, but his arms tightened like quicksand. The scent of petrichor and something distinctly Adrian - sandalwood and mint - triggered a memory she swiftly crushed. Her irritation flared at how easily he disrupted her equilibrium.

Adrian's hands anchored her shoulders and thighs, his voice deceptively calm. "A divorce isn't some teenage breakup, Vivian. Without my signature, it's not happening."

She went rigid. "Is this amusing to you? Some perverse entertainment?"

Instead of answering, his gaze swept across her chaotic workspace - scripts strewn like fallen leaves, half-empty coffee cups littering every surface.

A derisive chuckle escaped him. "This is what you call living? Working yourself to the bone like some indentured servant? You think this is what success looks like?"

Her jaw clenched. "Not your concern."

"Oh, it's absolutely my concern," Adrian snapped, irritation sharpening his words. "The Mirage Lounge incident, that brawl outside Cascade Residences last week - every mess you've stumbled into since leaving required my intervention. When will you stop pretending life's some reckless game?"

His words struck like icicles, freezing her momentarily. Then the dam broke.

"Don't you dare mention last week!" she seethed, voice trembling. "Do you have any idea how terrified I was? They drugged my drink, dragged me into that car like cargo! I smashed a bottle across someone's head, fought like hell, and still couldn't escape!"

Her voice cracked, tears threatening. "And where were you?" The accusation hung between them. "The cruel joke? Maxwell saved me. Not you. The man I married you to escape. Maybe I should've just married him instead!"
###Chapter 163

Her unguarded fragility lingered in the charged space between them.

Adrian studied Vivian with newfound clarity, as if seeing past her carefully constructed facade for the first time. The impenetrable walls around his heart trembled slightly. The man who prided himself on emotional detachment, who found vulnerability distasteful, felt an unfamiliar warmth spreading through his chest.

His grip slackened gradually. His hand moved awkwardly to pat her shoulder, the gesture reminiscent of comforting a frightened kitten. "Keep pursuing your acting career. I won't stand in your way."

Vivian seized the opportunity, stepping back with deliberate finality. "I don't want to be Mrs. Blackwood. I just want to be Vivian Hartley."

Adrian's expression clouded, thunder gathering in his stormy gaze. For someone who commanded boardrooms effortlessly, Vivian remained his greatest challenge. Closing billion-dollar deals felt simpler than navigating this emotional minefield.

Divorce had crossed his mind before. As Adrian Blackwood, eligible women flocked to him. But marriage represented more than fleeting passion - it was a sacred vow, a commitment he refused to break unlike his irresponsible father. The scars his sister bore from their father's abandonment had forged his unshakable resolve.

Composing himself, he rose and methodically dressed, buttoning his shirt with precise movements before turning toward the exit.

"Wait." Vivian's voice halted his retreat.

She approached, extending a small jar. "Have Ethan apply this later." Her tone carried unmistakable dismissal - a clear boundary set between them.

Adrian accepted the ointment wordlessly, his jaw tightening. He departed without another glance.

As Vivian moved to shut the door, movement flickered at the edge of her vision. She peered into the hallway, finding only empty silence. The shadow had passed Sebastian Hartwell's room and two other actors' doors. Probably just someone getting air, she reasoned.

The incident barely registered as she closed the door, returning to her temporary sanctuary.

Golden morning light spilled across the horizon when Vivian awoke. Dressing quickly in a flowing dress that complemented her loose waves, she headed to set. The sunrise painted her in ethereal light as she descended the grand staircase.

Near the entrance, Ethan paced anxiously, his eyes darting between his watch and the doorway. Spotting Vivian, relief washed over his features as he hurried forward with a carefully wrapped parcel.

"Mrs. Blackwood," he began breathlessly, presenting the package. "Mr. Blackwood sent fresh ointment. And breakfast - prepared specially for you."

Vivian let the package hover between them. "Ethan, I'd rather you didn't call me that anymore." Her tone held gentle firmness.

"Mrs. Blackwood, there's no need for concern," Ethan rushed to explain. "I checked thoroughly - no crew members nearby to overhear."

The morning breeze carried the scent of blooming jasmine as Vivian hesitated, the weight of unspoken decisions pressing between them. Somewhere beyond the villa gates, cameras waited to capture her next performance - both onscreen and off.
###Chapter 164

The morning sun cast long shadows across the cobblestone path as Vivian adjusted her sunglasses.

"It's not about being overheard," she interrupted, her voice dropping to a hushed whisper. A determined glint flashed in her hazel eyes as she tucked a stray chestnut lock behind her ear. "I've already given Adrian the divorce papers. The title of Mrs. Blackwood doesn't suit me anymore."

Ethan stood frozen for a heartbeat, the weight of her words settling between them. He lifted the carefully wrapped package again. "Ms. Hartley, my apologies. Though Mr. Blackwood remains concerned for your wellbeing." His fingers tightened around the ribbon. "He specifically included those almond croissants from that patisserie you love, thinking you might need them during filming breaks."

Vivian accepted the package with a polite nod, her expression carefully neutral. "Where's Adrian now?"

"We're scheduled to return to Crestwood this afternoon," Ethan replied smoothly.

"Mr. Blackwood left at dawn to visit the chapel in Emberglow County again."

Every trip to this quaint countryside found Adrian drawn to that ancient stone chapel. Vivian knew better than anyone that her soon-to-be-ex-husband didn't believe in divine intervention - the man worshipped only his own relentless willpower.

The memory surfaced unexpectedly - their midnight barbecue during that summer festival years ago, sticky fingers and shared laughter under paper lanterns. She hesitated before asking, "Has Adrian ever brought Serena...or anyone else here before?" The name caught in her throat like a fishbone.

Though Vivian had rephrased her question, Ethan understood perfectly. "No, Mr. Blackwood has never visited Emberglow County with Ms. Whitmore." He added pointedly, "She prefers the vibrancy of metropolitan life."

The implication was clear - Serena Whitmore would never deign to visit such provincial charm. If not with his first love, then Adrian must have come here as a boy, perhaps with family or school friends.

"Thank you. I should get going," Vivian said abruptly, already turning away.

Ethan called after her, "Mr. Blackwood has handled your legal matter thoroughly. Those men won't see daylight for at least a decade, so you needn't worry."

"Please convey my gratitude to your boss," Vivian tossed over her shoulder, quickening her pace toward the waiting van.

As Ethan watched her retreating figure, he pulled out his phone and typed: "Package delivered to Mrs. Blackwood. She seemed quite concerned about your whereabouts." A pause, then he added: "She's deeply appreciative of your efforts."

Adrian's reply came unusually fast - a single "Noted."

Ethan exhaled sharply, marveling at how strategic phrasing could work miracles.

The production team's vehicle idled by the inn's entrance. Spotting her colleagues, Vivian hurried forward. "Sorry for the delay!"

Just as she reached for the door handle, an icy finger traced down her spine. The sensation of being watched made her whirl around, heart hammering against her ribs. But the sun-dappled lane stood empty, not even a stray cat disturbing the morning stillness.
###Chapter 165

The unease clung to Vivian like a second skin as her eyes darted across the dimly lit alley. A single security camera watched over the entrance, its unblinking eye the only witness to the twisting shadows that offered perfect concealment.

"You're not yourself today. Maybe you should rest? I can cover your scenes tonight." Sebastian's voice held genuine concern as he took in her ashen complexion.

Vivian sat rigidly beside him, fingers twisting in her lap. "It's probably nothing. Just this... persistent feeling of being watched."

Sebastian leaned forward, scanning the gathering dusk. "I don't see anyone. Maybe just some overeager fan catching a glimpse of their favorite actress."

He gave her shoulder a reassuring squeeze. "Relax. We're on government property here. No crazed fans or tabloid vultures would dare cause trouble."

Vivian offered a noncommittal hum, her thoughts racing. If Ethan had confirmed those dangerous men were still in custody without bail, then who could be following her? Maxwell's face flashed through her mind, but she dismissed it immediately.

Her shooting schedule was public knowledge - Maxwell had no need for such theatrics if he wanted to see her. Yet the prickling sensation between her shoulder blades refused to fade.

The week in Emberglow County passed in a tense blur. Only when filming wrapped did Vivian finally exhale. Time accelerated, and suddenly it was the day of Beatrice's birthday celebration. Unlike previous extravagant hotel affairs, this year's event was hosted at Blackwood Manor under the pretense of modesty - though everyone knew the real purpose was to push Adrian and Vivian closer together.

As the matriarch, Margaret oversaw every detail personally. From floral arrangements to the guest list, menu planning to entertainment schedules - no element escaped her meticulous attention. The workload was staggering, but Margaret embraced it with fervor. This wasn't just a party; it was her chance to demonstrate her capabilities to the Blackwood elders and cement her status among the elite.

As evening fell, guests began arriving. Margaret greeted each with practiced charm, directing early arrivals to the gardens where rare orchids imported specifically for the occasion created a breathtaking display. While compliments showered down, Beatrice pulled Margaret aside with a frown.

"Where's Adrian?"

Margaret, flushed with praise, waved a dismissive hand. "Probably at the office. Don't fret - he'll be here for your toast."

Beatrice's expression darkened. "Still working? I told him days ago to bring Vivian."

Margaret's smile stiffened. After all her efforts, Beatrice's first concern was still that actress. "They're signing a hundred-million-Sterling contract with a European firm today. Surely business takes precedence over Vivian?" Since the last family gathering, Margaret had been waiting for the perfect moment to discuss Vivian's divorce from Adrian. In her eyes, Vivian was an ill-fitting thorn in the Blackwood family's side - someone who needed replacing with "better stock."

With an exasperated sigh, Beatrice waved her off. "Fine. Keep entertaining. I'll call Adrian myself."
###Chapter 166

Vivian strode purposefully through the design center's marble corridors, the click of her heels echoing against the walls. Ethan hurried to keep pace behind her. "Mr. Blackwood will join you after finalizing the contract details," he explained breathlessly. "In the meantime, we should begin your preparations."

She gave a distracted nod, her mind elsewhere. A secret part of her wished Adrian wouldn't appear at all.

The creative director greeted her with practiced charm. "Mrs. Blackwood, this evening's gown was commissioned specifically for you by Mr. Blackwood. He placed the order six weeks ago - it arrived this morning from our Paris atelier." His fingers brushed the fabric reverently. "Vintage silk charmeuse, embellished with South Sea pearls, each one stitched by hand."

As they entered the main showroom, Vivian's breath caught. The dress stood illuminated at the center of the space - a masterpiece of craftsmanship that seemed to glow from within.

Before she could speak, a familiar voice cut through the air. "Magnificent! Why haven't I seen this before? I must try it immediately!" Emerging from the dressing rooms came Serena Whitmore, every inch the polished socialite.

What cruel irony. Vivian's lips curled in amusement. "Is Adrian planning to escort both of us to Beatrice's birthday gala?"

Ethan went sheet-white, beads of sweat forming at his temples. "Mrs. Blackwood, I assure you this is purely coincidental! Mr. Blackwood would never—"

The director interjected smoothly, "Ms. Whitmore is attending the Film Guild Awards tonight. This gown wasn't intended for her."

Adrian was their most valued client, known for extravagant purchases and occasionally bringing entourages that created... complicated situations.

Sensing disaster, the director made a swift decision. "Mrs. Blackwood, please accept our apologies for this oversight." Turning to Serena, he adopted a professional tone. "Ms. Whitmore, this piece has been reserved. However, we've just received a breathtaking crimson mermaid gown from the same designer. Given that half of Hollywood will be wearing white tonight, the red would ensure you stand out."

A stylist hurried forward with the alternative dress, its rich hue and intricate beading dazzling under the lights. Serena barely glanced at it before fixing Vivian with a calculating stare. "Is she the one who claimed my dress?" she purred.

The director's throat went dry. "It's for Ms. Hartley—" He caught Serena's arched brow and hastily swallowed the "Mrs. Blackwood" that threatened to slip out. Survival instincts kicked in - discretion wasn't just polite, it was necessary.

As part of Adrian's inner circle, they'd all heard the whispers. Serena, ever the picture of entitled grace, pointed a perfectly manicured finger at the centerpiece gown. "I want that one," she declared, her voice sharp as broken crystal.

Tilting her head, she locked eyes with Vivian, her gaze a silent challenge: What will you do now?

The director mopped his brow. "This particular gown... was tailored to Ms. Hartley's measurements," he stammered. "The hem would be problematic. With the ceremony hours away, alterations would be impossible. It might... restrict your movement on stage."

Serena merely shrugged, her smile razor-thin. "Then find me taller heels."
###Chapter 167

The director stammered, his desperate gaze darting toward Vivian like a man grasping at straws.

Serena's lips twisted into a smug smirk. "Why don't we summon Adrian here? Since he's paying for this, let him decide who deserves this dress more - me or her."

The air grew heavy with unspoken tension.

Then Vivian's gentle voice cut through the silence. "If she wants it, let her have it. I'll pick another."

The director exhaled as if granted a last-minute reprieve. "Thank you," he gushed, flashing Vivian a relieved smile before snapping his fingers at an assistant. "Wrap this up immediately for Ms. Whitmore."

Serena shot Vivian a lingering, victorious glance, her satisfaction as obvious as a peacock displaying its feathers.

Even Ethan couldn't suppress his indignation on Vivian's behalf.

He turned toward her, voice hushed with concern. "Mrs. Blackwood—" But when he looked, Vivian had already drifted away. He found her across the room, calmly examining the collection of gowns with the serenity of undisturbed waters. For a moment, Ethan wasn't sure whether to feel reassured or troubled. It appeared she'd truly moved beyond caring about Mr. Blackwood's opinions.

Vivian ultimately chose two dresses: an emerald-hued modern Victorian design and a sleek silver number adorned with tiny pearls. With Serena gone to her private dressing room and only the director and Ethan remaining, Vivian held up her selections. "Which do you think suits me better?"

"The left one," they answered in unison, pointing to the silver gown. The director elaborated, "This one radiates sophistication and grace, perfect for Mrs. Beatrice Blackwood's birthday gala."

Vivian's slight frown hinted at disagreement. She understood the older generation's conservative tastes, but since she liked both options, the choice mattered little. "Very well," she nodded, handing the silver dress to the director.

Two hours later, Vivian emerged transformed. The silver gown clung to her curves like liquid moonlight. Her natural beauty, enhanced by subtle makeup, made her complexion glow like morning dew on rose petals. Soft curls framed her face, lending an ethereal quality that contrasted with her usual composed demeanor. The pearls scattered across the dress caught the light with every movement, creating a mesmerizing dance of reflections.

Serena appeared around the same time, but the comparison proved unflattering. Despite her towering heels, the dress still pooled awkwardly at her feet like melted wax. The strapless design emphasized her slender frame unflatteringly, while her heavy makeup only accentuated her sharp features. Her eyes darted around the room, catching every subtle reaction - each one a silent verdict.

The makeup artist attempted damage control with forced enthusiasm. "This gown costs over a million! Ms. Whitmore will undoubtedly be the belle of tonight's ball." Serena forced a thin smile. "Naturally," she said airily, dismissing the tension. "Though it's not exactly my preferred style."

Her gaze locked onto Vivian, her smile turning predatory. "But when I want something, I take it. Wouldn't you agree, Ms. Hartley?"

"At least the title of Mrs. Blackwood was never yours before, isn't yours now, and unless I choose otherwise, never will be." Vivian turned fully to face Serena, a faint smile playing on her lips. The chandelier's glow reflected in her eyes, making them sparkle with quiet confidence. Her voice remained measured, yet every word carried undeniable weight, reaching every corner of the room.

Moments earlier, she'd allowed Serena to claim the dress without protest, letting everyone assume she'd conceded defeat. Now, her words cut through the tension with surgical precision - grounded in unshakable certainty rather than Serena's hollow posturing.
###Chapter 168

Several of the younger women in the room exchanged glances, their lips twitching with suppressed amusement. Only Serena's icy presence kept them from outright applauding. Ethan Caldwell, who had witnessed Vivian Hartley's verbal duels with Adrian Blackwood countless times, maintained his professional composure. Yet even he couldn't deny the masterful way Vivian had reclaimed control of the situation.

Serena's perfect smile cracked, her manicured fingers digging into the fabric of the designer gown. Vivian's razor-sharp retort had caught her off guard—a rare occurrence for the socialite. Vivian continued with deliberate precision, "If you still harbor ambitions for that title, I suggest you steer clear of my affairs."

Her gaze flickered over Serena's dress, her voice dropping to a dangerous murmur. "As for that overpriced fabric you're clutching? I could purchase ten without Adrian's help. Spending millions to fuel your petty jealousy seems... beneath you. And him." With that, she turned on her heel toward Ethan. "We're leaving for Blackwood Manor."

"Frankly, I've had my fill of this circus." Ethan barely suppressed his smirk as he straightened his tie. "As you wish, Mrs. Blackwood," he replied, matching her brisk stride. Over his shoulder, he caught a final glimpse of Serena—pale-faced, trembling with rage, the coveted dress crumpled in her white-knuckled grip.

Pulling out his phone, Ethan shot Adrian a discreet text: "Package secured. En route to primary location."

Meanwhile, Adrian frowned at his phone screen from the backseat of his Maybach. "Change of plans," he instructed his driver. "Head directly to the estate."

As their car ascended the hill, Vivian spotted the sleek silver vehicle parked at the roadside. The setting sun glinted off its polished surface, making it impossible to miss. When Adrian emerged in his tailored black suit with silver embroidery, the reason for tonight's monochromatic dress code became clear.

The subtle pearlescent threads in his jacket mirrored the delicate shimmer of her gown, creating an understated yet intentional harmony. This quiet coordination spoke volumes more than any obvious matching ensemble could.

Ethan had barely parked when Adrian appeared at Vivian's door. "Grandmother insisted I escort you personally," he murmured, his deep voice laced with amusement as he leaned in.

Vivian arched an eyebrow. "How very dutiful of you." Her gaze swept over his impeccable attire. "Though I'm surprised you noticed my absence, given how... preoccupied you were with your ex's fashion choices."

Adrian's eyes narrowed. "I asked why you're not wearing the dress I selected. Not for a dramatic soliloquy."

"Because your childhood sweetheart seemed so emotionally invested in it," Vivian retorted, stepping past him. "I decided to spare everyone the spectacle of her fainting from sheer envy. Emergency rooms are crowded enough without her theatrics."

Adrian gave her a sidelong look. "Your compassion is... touching."

Pulling out her phone, Vivian scrolled past a message from Audrey about some new durian specialty shop near Cascade Residences. She'd declined—Beatrice Blackwood's birthday gala took precedence tonight.

The unread messages kept coming, but Vivian's attention was already elsewhere. The real performance was just beginning.
###Chapter 169

The text from Audrey made Vivian freeze mid-breath: "Attending every family gathering as Mrs. Blackwood, playing the perfect wife at every function. You've shouldered all the responsibilities without any of the privileges. Might as well sleep with him. At least Adrian's looks surpass those pretty boys at Mirage Lounge. Get something out of this sham marriage."

Her fingers hovered over the reply button when she sensed Adrian's gaze burning into her phone screen.

Vivian fumbled to lock her device, heat creeping up her neck. The humiliation tasted like ashes in her mouth. Adrian remained impassive, deliberately looking away while silence stretched between them like a live wire. Her nerves coiled tighter with each passing second, anticipating an explosion that never came.

His attention shifted to the modest diamond pendant resting against her collarbone. "That doesn't suit you," he remarked abruptly, producing a velvet box from his jacket. The hinge opened with a whisper, revealing a teardrop pink diamond that caught the dim car light, scattering prismatic sparks across the leather seats.

She accepted it mechanically. This was merely part of their charade - maintaining the Blackwood family's impeccable facade. Vivian had no intention of keeping it; their impending divorce would make such luxuries irrelevant soon enough.

Her fingers struggled with the delicate clasp behind her neck. Without warning, Adrian's hands replaced hers, his citrus-and-sandalwood cologne enveloping her as his breath warmed the sensitive skin below her ear. The briefest brush of his fingertips sent electric currents down her spine.

The moment shattered as quickly as it formed. Adrian secured the necklace and retreated to his side of the car. Vivian turned toward the window, willing her traitorous blush to fade. How pathetic, she chastised herself. Just because she lacked experience with men didn't excuse such juvenile reactions.

The car glided to a stop before Blackwood Manor. Adrian exited first, shielding the door frame with his palm in a practiced gesture. Collecting herself, Vivian stepped into the evening air, her emerald gown whispering against the pavement.

The assembled socialites froze mid-conversation. Their expressions flickered through shock, envy, and reluctant admiration. Throughout her marriage, Vivian had deliberately faded into the background - the invisible wife more servant than society matron. Tonight, with minimal effort, she shone like a rediscovered treasure, polished to breathtaking brilliance.

Adrian's arm encircled her waist, pulling her close until they moved as one entity - a flawless couple straight from the pages of a luxury magazine. Even the most critical guests couldn't deny their visual harmony, their coordinated outfits creating a striking tableau.

Noticing how her dress's embroidery mirrored his pocket square's pattern, Adrian leaned close, his lips grazing her ear. "You look exquisite." Playing her part, Vivian tilted her head with a perfectly calibrated smile, eyes sparkling with manufactured affection.

"Disgustingly adorable," someone in the crowd teased with exaggerated eye-rolling. "Newlyweds after all these years!"

The laughter that followed rang hollow in Vivian's ears.
###Chapter 170

Vivian beamed, soaking up the admiration. "Absolutely! Our Vivian is a treasure. Adrian struck gold marrying her." Nearby, Margaret and Bianca stood in icy silence, their expressions pinched with displeasure.

Bianca edged closer to Margaret, her whisper dripping with poison. "Aunt Margaret, you've sacrificed everything for this family, and Beatrice hasn't acknowledged you once. Yet Vivian just flutters her lashes and gets drowned in compliments."

Margaret's lips thinned, but she maintained a composed facade. "I simply fulfill my duties. Praise means nothing to me," she lied, the bitterness in her voice giving her away.

Bianca's eyes glittered with spite. "But Auntie, if Vivian keeps stealing the show, people might start seeing her as the true lady of Blackwood Manor." She couldn't stomach Vivian hogging the spotlight like this.

Margaret's quiet scoff was laced with contempt. "Lady of the house? That title will never be hers. Mark my words, her marriage to Adrian won't last." Bianca smirked and turned back to Beatrice, ready to stir more trouble.

Meanwhile, Vivian had clasped Beatrice's hands warmly, her voice soft yet heartfelt. "Beatrice, I wish you endless happiness and good health for years to come."

Bianca's sharp eyes immediately noticed Vivian's empty hands. "Vivian," she called out with feigned shock, "don't tell me you didn't bring Beatrice a gift?" The surrounding guests turned, their gazes a mix of scorn and barely hidden delight. They were practically salivating at the prospect of Vivian's social blunder. Surely someone from such modest beginnings wouldn't understand proper etiquette?

Ethan swiftly stepped forward, presenting a velvet jewelry box. "Happy birthday, Mrs. Beatrice Blackwood. This is from Mr. Blackwood," he announced politely.

He opened the box to reveal a breathtaking blue diamond ring, the center stone as large as a quail's egg, encircled by smaller white diamonds. The design was both luxurious and refined, its facets catching the light spectacularly.

Vivian carefully slid the ring onto Beatrice's finger, her face radiant. "It suits you perfectly," she said warmly.

A guest well-versed in fine jewelry immediately exclaimed, "That's a custom Bulgari piece commissioned by a private collector! It sold at auction recently for $26.5 million. Must be at least 11 carats!"

"Actually, 11.16 carats," Ethan corrected smoothly.

The crowd erupted in astonished murmurs. These guests—scions of Crestwood's and even Northshire's wealthiest families—couldn't conceal their amazement. Spending such an astronomical sum on a single gift was unheard of at these gatherings.

"The Blackwood fortune is truly staggering," one guest whispered in awe.

The flattery came thick and fast. "Mr. Blackwood is such a devoted grandson!"

"What an extraordinary gesture from Mr. Blackwood!"

"Mrs. Beatrice, you're blessed with such an accomplished grandson."

"You live so comfortably, unlike us constantly bailing out our irresponsible grandson."

The whispers continued, each more sycophantic than the last. Vivian stood quietly, her smile never wavering, while Margaret and Bianca's expressions grew increasingly sour. The game was far from over, and everyone in the glittering ballroom knew it.
###Chapter 171

The dazzling diamond necklace shimmered under the chandelier lights. "This piece embodies Mrs. Beatrice Blackwood's grace perfectly," voices overlapped in admiration as guests vied for her attention.

Just as the excitement peaked, Dominic Sinclair made his entrance, his hazel eyes sparkling at the animated gathering.

"Mrs. Blackwood, happy birthday!" Dominic approached with an elegant bow. "You're glowing more radiantly each year. When I first saw you, I mistook you for one of Adrian's younger aunts!" He presented an exquisite Ming dynasty vase to a servant. "This will complement your bedroom's decor beautifully."

Beatrice chuckled, patting his arm affectionately. "Always the charmer, Dominic. You know exactly how to flatter an old woman."

Bianca Thornton spotted Dominic and hurried over, her cheeks flushing pink. "Dominic," she murmured softly.

Dominic barely acknowledged her, his attention elsewhere. "Has no one noticed the real showstopper around Vivian's neck?" His voice carried a playful challenge.

While guests had certainly noticed Vivian Hartley's presence, none had paid particular attention to her necklace until Dominic's remark. Now all eyes focused on the pendant resting against her collarbone.

Dominic's lips curved triumphantly. "That," he announced, "is a rare pink diamond auctioned at Frostholm last week for $10.75 million. The largest internally flawless fancy vivid pink diamond ever sold publicly."

He'd pulled countless strings to acquire it - ensuring while Beatrice's gift was magnificent, Vivian's would make its own unforgettable statement. Though slightly less expensive, its uniqueness made it priceless.

Turning to Vivian with expectant eyes, Dominic grinned. "I flew to Frostholm personally for this. Don't I deserve some special recognition?"

Vivian offered a polite but distant smile. "Thank you, Dominic. I'll take you to dinner sometime."

Gasps rippled through the crowd. Vivian had been wearing a fortune around her neck all evening.

Bianca's nails dug into her palms as she glared at Vivian. Why did everyone obsess over her? Even Dominic, whom she'd adored for years, seemed like Vivian's personal assistant.

Unable to contain herself, Bianca stepped forward, sweetness lacing her venom. "Vivian, we've heard about everyone's gifts, but you still haven't answered my question. Didn't you bring anything for Beatrice?"

Adrian's expression darkened instantly. "Any gift from me is from Vivian as well," he stated coldly.

Beatrice quickly nodded in agreement. "Of course. They're a couple - one gift is perfectly appropriate."

Bianca pressed on, her smile sharp. "But Beatrice, I'm just concerned. You've been so generous to Vivian, yet she couldn't be bothered to prepare anything personally? Doesn't that seem... ungrateful?"

Vivian met Bianca's gaze steadily, a faint smile playing on her lips. "What makes you think I didn't prepare something?"
###Chapter 172

Vivian's smile was like the first golden light of dawn melting winter's last frost, revealing a hidden radiance that made Adrian lose his breath for a moment.

He'd always been wary of women who stirred drama, especially within the complex web of his family. Before, Bianca had constantly thrown veiled insults at Vivian. Whenever Adrian noticed, he'd offer gentle admonishments. Vivian would always respond with that same serene smile, brushing off the tension as unimportant. But he was a wolf—how could his mate be a timid lamb?

The Vivian standing before him now ignited something primal in his chest.

"Bianca," Vivian spoke, her voice like honey laced with steel. "You've been so... persistent about this gift. Those who know you might call it thoughtfulness. But to outsiders, it might look like you simply can't stand seeing me shine." Her tone danced between playful and cutting, effortlessly exposing Bianca's true intentions.

Bianca's face twisted in irritation. "If you've actually prepared something, why the secrecy? Stop playing games!"

Vivian turned to Beatrice with genuine warmth. "My gift is a performance. I'll share it after dinner."

Adrian adjusted his cufflinks, eyebrows lifting in surprise. He hadn't expected this from Vivian, and curiosity burned through him. She was the same woman, yet fundamentally different—constantly defying his expectations.

Bianca's mocking laugh sliced through the moment. "A performance? Please don't tell me you're planning some amateur theatrics for our entertainment?"

Where Vivian exuded quiet grace, Bianca's exaggerated reactions seemed almost crude in comparison.

Beatrice's commanding voice cut through the tension. "Enough!"

Bianca froze, her bravado crumbling instantly. In her eagerness to one-up Vivian, she'd forgotten one crucial fact—Beatrice Blackwood wasn't someone you crossed lightly. As a distant relative of the Blackwood family, Bianca knew her place; she had no right to criticize Beatrice's chosen granddaughter-in-law.

The crowd's murmurs shifted, their earlier skepticism about Vivian now turning into quiet disdain for the Thornton family. Comments about their failing business ventures and Bianca's lack of decorum floated through the air like poisoned darts. Bianca felt their judgment like physical blows. She scanned the room desperately, her gaze landing on Margaret. But Margaret's attention was elsewhere, focused on Dominic who was typing on his phone with a smirk that suggested private amusement.

Bianca's instincts screamed danger. As Adrian and Vivian escorted Beatrice gracefully toward the Seabreeze Villa's dining room, Bianca's eyes burned into Vivian's retreating back. After a moment's hesitation, she squared her shoulders and marched toward Dominic.

Her voice dripped saccharine sweetness as she called, "Dominic."

Startled, Dominic took an exaggerated step back. When their eyes met, he relaxed dramatically, clutching his chest with a theatrical gasp. "Bianca! You move like a shadow—nearly gave me a coronary sneaking up like that. What are you, some kind of specter?"

Bianca blinked, thrown by the comparison. A specter? Wasn't she the picture of elegance? Still, she swallowed her irritation. This was her chance to get closer to Dominic Sinclair, and she wouldn't waste it.

Forcing patience into her voice, she asked, "Who has you so engrossed? You seemed completely absorbed."
###Chapter 173

Dominic glanced at his phone, his lips curving into an involuntary smile at the playful profile picture lighting up his screen. With a careless swipe, he exited the messaging app. "Just one of my cousins," he explained casually. "She's searching for an apartment near her university, and one of her classmates happens to know the area well."

A quiet chuckle escaped him as he recalled the sharp wit and offbeat humor of the girl he'd been texting. It had been ages since someone had intrigued him this effortlessly.

Bianca's interest waned instantly at the mention of family. "Oh, your cousin," she murmured, her tone flat. Without hesitation, she pivoted the conversation. "Dominic, why don't I introduce you to Adrian's grandfather inside?"

His gaze swept across the garden, taking in the elegant crowd admiring the meticulously arranged flowers. Recognizing he was out of place among such refined company, he nodded and followed Bianca indoors.

In a secluded corner of the grand living room, Margaret sat by the sunlit window, her movements precise as she brewed coffee. She had no desire to confront Vivian directly—such a scene would only create unnecessary tension. Nor did she wish to play the gracious, doting mother-in-law for their guests. Instead, she sought refuge in this quiet nook, savoring a moment of peace amidst the party's lively hum.

Leonard observed her practiced hands as she poured the rich, aromatic brew. "Among the Blackwoods," he remarked with appreciation, "no one makes coffee quite like you."

Margaret offered him a graceful smile. "Leonard, I'm flattered, but drinking coffee this late might leave you restless all night."

"Margaret, could you prepare some for Vivian and Adrian as well?"

Before she could finish, Beatrice entered with Vivian and Adrian in tow. Vivian greeted them warmly. "Leonard, Margaret."

Leonard, well-versed in the couple's marital struggles thanks to Margaret's confidences, studied them thoughtfully. With the wisdom of his years, he offered gentle counsel. "Marriage is never without its challenges. Even the strongest couples face storms. What matters is understanding each other and nurturing that bond."

To Vivian's astonishment, Adrian responded without hesitation. Closing the distance between them, he draped an arm around her slender waist in a display of intimacy. "We'll do exactly that. With any luck, by next year's gathering, you'll be holding your great-grandchild."

Vivian's eyes widened. For a man as notoriously reserved and pragmatic as Adrian, such a declaration—especially in front of family—was utterly uncharacteristic. Her mind raced with questions.

Had he truly considered this? Where exactly did he plan to procure this great-grandchild? Surely not from her—was he thinking of Serena and her unborn child instead?

Adrian's sharp gaze caught her racing thoughts, her expressive eyes flickering with suspicion. A faint smirk touched his lips, but he remained silent.

Leonard, however, was delighted by the prospect. His face lit up with a broad smile. "Marvelous! Four generations under one roof would be a true blessing."

Beatrice, far from convinced, arched a knowing brow. She was well aware the marriage remained unconsummated. With a sly smile, she added, "Don't just say it to please us. If you're serious about a child, you'll need to put in the work. Perhaps cut back on those endless business dinners and cocktails."

"Understood, Grandmother," Adrian replied with obedient deference.
###Chapter 174

Vivian rose gracefully from her seat, her movements fluid as she handed Beatrice a steaming cup of coffee. Her gaze lingered momentarily on the dazzling necklace adorning Margaret's neck—a piece that seemed to command attention effortlessly. The sight stirred something within her, but before she could dwell on it, Bianca's shrill voice cut through the air.

"Dominic's arrived!" She was practically dragging him toward Leonard.

"Good evening, Leonard," Dominic greeted with practiced charm, his smile effortlessly disarming. "You're looking as distinguished as ever."

Bianca noticed Vivian's lingering stare and seized the opportunity. "Aunt Margaret, that necklace Vivian's wearing? It's a gift from Adrian. Can you imagine? Today is Grandma's birthday, yet Vivian still managed to receive a present." She turned to Dominic with a pointed look. "Dominic, isn't that necklace valued at $10.73 million?"

Dominic, clearly caught off guard, rubbed his chin awkwardly. His response was smooth but evasive. "Margaret, you don't need diamonds to outshine anyone—your presence alone does that."

Before Margaret could respond, Vivian spoke softly. "If you admire it, Margaret, I'd be happy to give it to you."

Margaret's composure remained unshaken. "That won't be necessary. Pink isn't my color."

Dominic smoothly redirected the conversation. "Exactly! Margaret was born to wear rubies—regal and timeless."

Adrian, who had been observing silently, added coolly, "Keep an eye out for exceptional rubies on the market. If you find something suitable, purchase it and have it delivered to Blackwood Manor."

Margaret took a sip of her coffee, her expression unreadable. "I'm past the age for flashy jewelry."

Beatrice interjected with a knowing smile, flashing her own diamond ring. "If I can still wear jewelry at my age, you certainly can, Margaret. You're far from old."

"Beatrice, it's your birthday—of course you should indulge," Margaret replied smoothly, deftly shifting the focus.

Bianca, however, wasn't ready to abandon her attempts to undermine Vivian. But before she could speak again, Dominic placed a firm hand on her shoulder. "Bianca, I'm feeling peckish. Would you mind showing me where the hors d'oeuvres are?"

As Bianca reluctantly accompanied Dominic, Vivian couldn't help but notice how he—someone who had never shown her particular kindness before—had intervened multiple times that evening to spare her potential embarrassment. It was an unexpected gesture that didn't escape her notice.

Bianca's expression darkened as Dominic led her away, her resentment toward Vivian growing more intense by the minute.

The birthday celebration was in full swing, with nearly all the guests having arrived. Margaret knew she couldn't postpone her hosting duties any longer. With visible reluctance, she set aside her coffee and rejoined the gathering.

Beatrice, ever perceptive to family dynamics, saw an opportunity to ease the tension between Vivian and Margaret. "Vivian," she suggested warmly, "your mother-in-law could use assistance with the guests. Why don't you lend her a hand?"

"Of course," Vivian replied without hesitation.

Margaret initially wanted to refuse. However, noticing Adrian's indifferent expression, a flicker of irritation passed through her eyes.
###Chapter 175

"Would I ever humiliate Vivian in public?" Margaret snapped, her violet eyes flashing with indignation.

Adrian remained composed. "That wasn't my implication."

Vivian gave him a fleeting glance before turning to follow Margaret.

The late arrivals were Crestwood's elite, those with deeper connections to the Blackwood dynasty. Whispers about Vivian's rumored divorce had reached many ears. To them, a commoner daring to leave her billionaire husband could only mean one thing - a calculated play for greater wealth.

Earlier gossip about Vivian's pink diamond necklace resurfaced as guests compared it to Margaret's exquisite violet jade pendant. While elegant, the jade couldn't compete with the diamond's dazzling brilliance.

Isabella Thornton, known to be Margaret's confidante, seized the opportunity to approach. After a dismissive once-over of Vivian, she turned to Margaret with a probing smile. "I heard the young couple had some... disagreements recently." Her deliberate mention of private matters in Vivian's presence spoke volumes about her disregard.

But her motive wasn't drama - it was reconnaissance. Should Adrian and Vivian divorce, it might create opportunities for women in her social circle.

Margaret sighed theatrically. "Modern youth value their independence too much. I couldn't stop their impulsive marriage, just as I can't control their quarrels or potential divorce." Her message was clear - she neither approved of Vivian's place in the Blackwood family nor believed the marriage would last.

Isabella nodded knowingly before turning to Vivian with faux concern. "Darling, since you've married above your station, you should know your place. Don't let ambition cloud your judgment." Her gaze lingered pointedly on Vivian's diamond necklace.

Vivian's nails dug into her palms, but she maintained perfect composure. This was Beatrice's birthday gala - causing a scene would only validate their prejudice. She offered a polite smile as if oblivious to the insult.

Across the room, Adrian observed the exchange, his stormy gaze darkening. Beatrice noticed his reaction and murmured, "Vivian's endured much since joining our family."

Adrian's jaw tightened. "You haven't seen her at her most formidable."

Beatrice pressed, "No matter how sharp her tongue, she can't combat this tide of malice alone. She's your wife. Only when you publicly cherish her will others follow suit."

Something unreadable flickered across Adrian's face.

Seizing the moment, Beatrice nudged him. "Go to her. Stop brooding here like a storm cloud. I have acquaintances to greet."

After a brief hesitation, Adrian strode toward Vivian. Nodding politely at the gathered ladies, he focused entirely on his wife, his presence an unspoken shield against further barbs.
###Chapter 176

Vivian's breath caught when Adrian's piercing gaze locked onto hers. The glacial indifference that usually defined his eyes had vanished, replaced by a warmth that made her pulse stutter. "Darling," he murmured, his voice velvet-soft, "you look exhausted. Let me take you somewhere quiet."

Margaret Blackwood, who'd been mid-scolding, froze with her lips parted. The divorce papers were practically signed—why was her son behaving like a newlywed? The affectionate display contradicted everything she'd been told.

Even Bianca's carefully composed mask slipped for a fraction of a second. She'd counted on Vivian's humiliation driving her away. Yet Adrian's possessive behavior suggested he had no intention of releasing his wife.

Vivian stiffened at his uncharacteristic tenderness. "I'm fine, really," she demurred, fingers twisting in her lap. "Don't trouble yourself."

To the assembled guests, it appeared the Blackwood heiress was playing hard to get, reveling in her husband's attention. They braced for Adrian's notorious temper to surface. Instead, he did something that sent shockwaves through the room.

Dragging a gilded chair beside hers, he sat—then pulled Vivian onto his lap with effortless grace. His arm encircled her waist like an iron band. "Then I'll be your chair," he declared, lips brushing her ear.

Vivian shot upright as if electrocuted, only to meet Margaret's arctic glare. Too late. Again.

That withering look sliced through her defenses. Vivian's shoulders hunched instinctively, her gaze dropping to the marble floor where she wished it would swallow her whole.

A tittering laugh broke the tension. "Margaret, your daughter-in-law is such a fragile flower," cooed one of the society matrons, her saccharine smile not reaching her eyes. "My Zinnia? Built like an ox since birth—manages our entire estate single-handedly."

Vivian's spine straightened. Was this woman actually pimping her daughter at a funeral?

Strangely, she felt relief. At least the attention had shifted.

She edged backward, attempting to merge with the damask wallpaper.

Margaret's lips curved in a calculated smile. "Zinnia always was remarkable. Why isn't she here today?"

The woman preened. "Oh, she's in Provence studying patisserie at Le Cordon Bleu. Top of her class, naturally."

"How impressive," Margaret purred. "You must bring her to the manor. Adrian adores French desserts." The subtext hung heavier than the chandeliers.

Adrian chose that moment to rise, adjusting his cufflinks with lethal precision. "Mother really shouldn't trouble herself with my culinary preferences," he said, his voice like shards of ice. "Given how seldom I dine at home."

The temperature in the room plummeted.

What began as a not-so-subtle setup had just been publicly dismantled. The matchmaking attempt now resembled a botched staff recruitment.

Vivian bit her lip to suppress a hysterical laugh. The Blackwood family drama was better than any soap opera.

And she? Merely a pawn in their endless power plays.

Yet as Adrian's fingers brushed the small of her back—a gesture both protective and possessive—she wondered if the game's rules had changed without anyone telling her.
###Chapter 177

Vivian's eyes widened, and the woman beside her froze for a heartbeat.

Adrian turned toward the woman, his lips curving into a faint, almost playful smile. "Besides," he continued, "my wife is precious. And with a full staff at Seabreeze Villa, there's hardly much for her to do." The message was crystal clear now. Even the most oblivious guest could see it. Adrian was publicly standing by Vivian's side.

With her family's business tied to the Blackwood Group, the woman wasn't about to risk offense.

"Mr. Blackwood," she said, forcing a laugh, "you're not only successful but also very protective of your wife." A murmur rippled through the crowd. Someone muttered, "She may not have the pedigree, but she's certainly lucky."

Adrian's response was immediate. "You're right. I am lucky to have such a remarkable wife."

Vivian's chest tightened. His words sounded perfect, yet they twisted inside her like a knife. He wasn't shielding her; he was placing her on a pedestal, making her an even clearer target for their disdain.

Her fears proved justified as Margaret's expression darkened. "Vivian," she snapped, her voice dripping with condescension. "If you're going to act, focus on acting. Leave those unsavory habits from Hollywood behind. Show some respect to your elders. The Blackwood family has a reputation to uphold."

Before Vivian could respond, Adrian stepped forward, his voice icy and unwavering. "Mother, that's enough."

Margaret's eyes narrowed, but she waved him off dismissively. "Fine. Take your wife to dinner if you're so concerned."

Adrian reached for Vivian's hand, but she recoiled as if his touch burned. Her eyes, glinting with cold fury, locked onto his.

Without a word, she turned sharply and walked away, her steps quick and purposeful.

Vivian's heart raced, her chest tight with frustration. She was done being used as a pawn, only to be insulted for her trouble.

Adrian's hand hovered in the air, fingers curling slightly before he slowly let it fall. His gaze followed her retreat, unreadable, but his jaw tightened visibly.

Vivian approached a servant. "Move the piano to the garden terrace," she said in a soft but firm voice.

Bianca, who had been quietly observing from the shadows, couldn't help but smirk. A piano? So Vivian's "performance" would be a piano piece, then.

Bianca's lips curled into a smug smile. Finally, a chance to watch Vivian humiliate herself. Fake was fake, after all. When the clock struck midnight, Cinderella would return to her rags.

The dishes served at Beatrice's birthday celebration were nothing short of spectacular. Despite this, each guest was lost in their own thoughts, and regrettably, the culinary masterpieces went largely unnoticed.

As the evening progressed, the servers brought in new platters, and a particular dish of golden fish immediately caught Vivian's attention. Margaret, taking on the role of hostess, explained with a hint of pride, "This was caught just after twilight, directly from the ocean."

Those gathered, well-versed in gourmet cuisine, recognized instantly the rarity before them. The wild yellow croaker, a delicacy that commanded thousands per pound, shimmered on the platter. Its value increased due to its unique golden hue, achieved by shielding it from light. Unlike its daytime-caught counterparts, which often needed artificial enhancement in freezers to attain a similar golden luster, this fish was naturally exquisite.
###Chapter 178

Margaret Blackwood gracefully scooped the most delicate portion of fish belly into a porcelain bowl and offered it to Beatrice. "You must try this, Beatrice."

With practiced elegance, Beatrice redirected the bowl toward Vivian Hartley instead. "Legend says fish grants mothers beauty and their children wisdom. Vivian dear, perhaps it's time to bless the Blackwood lineage with a brilliant heir."

The remark was a masterstroke - simultaneously addressing motherhood expectations while silencing the divorce rumors that had been circulating through high society. Beatrice's words reinforced her matriarchal authority while steering the conversation away from scandalous gossip.

Vivian immediately understood the underlying message. Accepting the bowl with both hands, she murmured a sincere, "Thank you, Beatrice."

Bianca Thornton appeared distracted throughout dinner, toying with her food while keeping subtle watch on Vivian's movements.

The moment Vivian set down her utensils, Bianca seized the opportunity. "Dominic! They're doing fireworks tonight - won't you play the piano for us?"

Though Dominic Sinclair hadn't achieved remarkable professional success, his aristocratic upbringing included extensive training in fine arts. During university, he'd particularly excelled in music, winning several prestigious international piano competitions.

Dominic swallowed his last bite of shrimp, looking up in mild surprise. "What brought this on?"

Bianca flashed an innocent smile. "It just occurred to me - I can't recall the last time we heard you play."

"It has been far too long," Beatrice interjected, noticing Bianca's shift in focus. "Do indulge us, Dominic."

Never one to refuse an audience, Dominic's face lit up. "With pleasure!"

After dinner and the spectacular fireworks display, the entire party gathered around the grand piano. Dominic selected a technically demanding etude requiring exceptional finger dexterity and precision - rapid arpeggios in the right hand while the left maintained the melodic line.

The opening notes emerged like whispered secrets before erupting into passionate cascades that resonated through every listener. Dominic's slender fingers danced across the keys with mesmerizing grace, weaving an intricate musical tapestry that held everyone spellbound.

Bianca, momentarily forgetting her schemes against Vivian, became completely absorbed in the performance. Her admiration was understandable - Dominic had always been the family's musical prodigy.

As the final chords faded, Bianca burst into enthusiastic applause. "Absolutely breathtaking, Dominic!" Her gaze then found Vivian standing slightly apart beneath a tree, seemingly trying to remain unnoticed.

Watching Dominic's virtuoso performance, Vivian hesitated to approach the piano herself.

Bianca suddenly linked arms with Vivian, pulling her forward. "Vivian, you had the piano brought out earlier. Were you planning to treat Beatrice to a performance as well?"
###Chapter 179

The room fell into a hushed silence as Bianca's question hung in the air. Every gaze turned toward Vivian, anticipation thickening the atmosphere.

Vivian's lips pressed together in a brief moment of hesitation.

Bianca's chest swelled with satisfaction, mistaking Vivian's pause for weakness. Determined not to let her escape, Bianca tightened her grip and pulled Vivian toward the grand piano, her voice dripping with false encouragement. "Vivian, darling, if you've prepared this special gift, you must be confident in it. Take your time—we're all dying to hear what you've got."

Dominic's eyebrows shot up in surprise. He hadn't anticipated Bianca would push Vivian into performing publicly like this. A pang of guilt struck him as he realized his earlier performance had unintentionally backed Vivian into a corner. Running fingers through his dark hair, he searched for an exit strategy. "I had no idea we'd both prepared musical gifts. Why don't I just present mine on Vivian's behalf?" he offered, trying to shield her from scrutiny.

Vivian remained silent, her expression unreadable as she seemed to consider Dominic's proposal. Bianca's smile turned saccharine. "Have someone else perform your gift? That would be rather... inappropriate, wouldn't it?" Her eyes glittered as she cut off any potential escape route. "Come now, Dominic, be a gentleman. Surely you don't mind if Vivian has her moment to shine?" she teased.

Turning to Vivian with exaggerated sweetness, she pressed, "Isn't that right, Vivian?"

Vivian finally spoke, her voice measured and calm. "Yes, the gift I prepared for Mrs. Blackwood is a piano composition."

Dominic swiftly pulled out the piano bench for Vivian before moving to Adrian's side. He lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. "Aren't you going to intervene?"

Adrian didn't respond immediately. Instead, he reached into his jacket pocket, extracted a cigarette, and lit it with deliberate calm, his dark eyes never leaving Vivian.

For a fleeting moment, Vivian hesitated, her slender fingers hovering above the ivory keys like a dancer preparing for performance.

Bianca barely contained her glee, her grin stretching wide. She could already picture Vivian becoming the laughingstock of Crestwood's elite after tonight. Concealing a smirk, Bianca discreetly pulled out her phone, switching to video mode to immortalize what she was certain would be Vivian's public humiliation.

The opening notes emerged soft and unassuming, a gentle melody flowing effortlessly beneath Vivian's fingers. Bianca's ears found nothing remarkable, and the murmurs in the crowd reflected similar disinterest.

"Technically proficient," someone whispered. "But after Mr. Sinclair's performance, this feels rather... ordinary."

While not the disaster some had hoped for, neither did it captivate the audience. Yet Vivian remained utterly absorbed, her focus absolute. Her posture was regal—the elegant curve of her neck, the poised set of her shoulders creating a silhouette of refined grace. Her fingers moved across the keys with the fluidity of swans gliding across a lake, mesmerizing in their precision.

No one could deny the arresting beauty of the image she presented. Her natural elegance dispelled any notion of humble origins, radiating a sophistication that seemed bred through generations. The effortless grace she embodied spoke of old money and timeless refinement.

Beatrice's expression shifted subtly, and she exchanged a meaningful glance with Leonard. A silent understanding passed between them as the music continued to unfold.

###Chapter 180

The abrupt change in Beatrice and Leonard's expressions sent ripples through the gathering. Murmurs died down as guests redirected their attention to the grand piano, intrigue flickering in their eyes. A wave of bewilderment spread - what could have shaken the Blackwood matriarch and patriarch so profoundly? Even Dominic felt it, his sharp gaze narrowing with dawning comprehension.

He straightened abruptly, his voice cutting through the hush. "This... this is Mr. Montclair's unfinished magnum opus!"

"Montclair?" A shocked whisper broke out.

The room plunged into stunned silence, all eyes locking onto Dominic in disbelief.

That name carried the weight of musical royalty.

The Montclairs of Sterling were the undisputed aristocracy of classical music. They didn't merely play - they redefined the very essence of piano artistry.

More significantly, the family patriarch currently chaired the International Music Council, one of Sterling's most prestigious institutions.

Yet Dominic wasn't referring to the current family head. He spoke of Julian Montclair.

Julian had been the younger brother, the family's prodigal genius, a legend whose brilliance still echoed through concert halls.

His story was etched in musical lore.

A child prodigy, he'd captivated global audiences by age ten, dominating international competitions and performing to enraptured crowds worldwide. Critics hailed him as the second coming of Mozart, a once-in-a-century talent.

But fate had other designs.

At twenty, on the cusp of his prime, a tragic accident claimed his life.

The loss reverberated through the music world - a star extinguished too soon.

It was as if the heavens had reclaimed their favored son, unwilling to share such divine talent with mortals.

Julian left behind one final composition - a piece forever incomplete.

He'd performed fragments just once, at an intimate private recital. With no recordings surviving, the work became myth. Countless musicians attempted reconstructions, their efforts only highlighting the original's unreachable perfection.

Skeptical murmurs spread through the crowd.

"How could Dominic possibly know?" someone challenged. "That was decades ago. He wasn't even born when Julian died. How can he recognize it from just the opening bars?"

Dominic's voice rang out, firm and unwavering. "There's no error. My mentor worshipped Julian. Though he never mastered the full piece, he practiced the prelude obsessively. I've heard those notes a thousand times - they're etched into my memory."

Beatrice stepped forward, her voice tinged with wistful remembrance. "He's correct. I attended that final performance. I heard Julian play it myself."

Julian's music had scored Beatrice's youth, that haunting, unfinished melody lingering in her heart like an unresolved chord.
###Chapter 181

The grand ballroom glittered with crystal chandeliers as Vivian Hartley took her seat at the grand piano. The murmurs of the elite guests faded into expectant silence. Tonight wasn't just any birthday celebration - it was Beatrice Blackwood's eightieth, and the entire Blackwood dynasty had gathered at Seabreeze Villa.

Vivian's fingers hovered above the ivory keys, her heart pounding. She remembered that casual conversation a year ago, when Beatrice had wistfully mentioned Adrian's unfinished composition. That fleeting remark had become Vivian's secret mission - to resurrect the melody that meant everything to the Blackwood matriarch.

Leonard Blackwood squeezed his wife's hand, whispering, "Our Adrian couldn't have chosen better. With Vivian by his side, I've no worries about the family's future."

Across the room, Bianca Thornton's manicured nails dug into her palms. This wasn't how she'd imagined the evening unfolding. Dominic Sinclair's earlier praise had set the stage perfectly - for Vivian to steal what should have been her moment.

Bianca opened her mouth to speak, but the words died in her throat. Music theory had never been her forte.

Margaret Blackwood remained statuesque beside her daughter. "The introduction is rather elementary," she remarked coolly, her decades of piano training lending authority to her critique. "Any conservatory student could play it blindfolded."

A ripple of agreement spread through the crowd. How could this small-town girl possibly compare to their refined tastes? Vivian's humble beginnings made their privileged educations seem almost vulgar.

Then the music changed.

Vivian's hands became a blur across the keyboard, the melody transforming into something transcendent. Each note carried the weight of lived experience, telling stories no words could capture. The room seemed to brighten, as if the sun had broken through storm clouds.

This wasn't mere performance - it was revelation.

Adrian Blackwood sat motionless, his forgotten cigarette burning to ash between his fingers. The woman at the piano bore little resemblance to the quiet wife he knew. This Vivian burned with artistic fire, her passion igniting something primal in his chest.

Dominic Sinclair, a virtuoso in his own right, felt his worldview shift. He'd spent his life chasing technical perfection, only to witness true artistry in the most unexpected place.

As the final chord faded, Vivian rose gracefully. The stunned silence lasted three heartbeats before erupting into thunderous applause.

She approached Beatrice with quiet dignity. "Happy birthday, Grandmother."

Tears glistened in the older woman's eyes. "My dear child," Beatrice whispered, clasping Vivian's hands. "You've given me back a piece of my soul I thought lost forever." Her voice broke. "The hours you must have sacrificed... the dedication..."

Vivian simply smiled, the unspoken truth hanging between them - some gifts couldn't be bought, only earned through love's quiet labor.
###Chapter 182

Vivian's smile faltered slightly. "I'm just glad you enjoyed it," she murmured, deftly avoiding any emotional display.

A pang of guilt twisted in Vivian's chest. The melody wasn't truly hers - it had been Eleanor's favorite lullaby, the one she'd hummed during golden afternoons in their tiny kitchen. Growing up in that provincial town without means for proper lessons, Vivian had clung to this simple tune, repeating it until it became part of her very being.

She knew its every nuance better than any classical piece. Who could have imagined this childhood comfort would become Adrian Blackwood's final musical legacy?

The audience erupted in deafening applause, their cheers reverberating through the grand hall. Even the skeptics couldn't deny the raw magnetism of Vivian's performance, their reluctant admiration evident in their thunderous ovation.

One attendee, caught in the moment's magic, remarked knowingly, "Mr. Blackwood has truly outshone himself with this lavish declaration of love for Mrs. Blackwood." As guests dissected the evening's events, they unanimously credited its success to Adrian's meticulous planning. With his vast resources and connections, particularly his friendship with Dominic, arranging elite coaches to polish Vivian's skills would have been effortless.

Yet Adrian merely shrugged, his voice steady, "This had nothing to do with me."

His modest denial earned knowing smiles; clearly he was protecting Vivian's dignity. The event not only silenced rumors of marital discord but also rewrote social narratives, transforming Vivian from Cinderella to undisputed Blackwood matriarch.

As the celebration wound down, Bianca approached Dominic with disappointment lacing her voice. "Father couldn't make it tonight," she said softly, fingers brushing his sleeve. "Could you take me home?" Her eyes held a silent plea for companionship.

Dominic subtly stepped back, avoiding her touch. "I can't. I've been drinking and shouldn't drive."

Bianca had orchestrated tonight's scheme to humiliate Vivian, using Dominic as her unwitting pawn. Had this not been Beatrice's birthday, he would have confronted her directly.

"But I—" Bianca stammered.

Dominic was already walking away without a backward glance.

Vivian remained engrossed in conversation with the elderly couple, only noticing the emptied courtyard much later. Rising gracefully, she bid them farewell. "Beatrice, Leonard, I should be going now."

Beatrice offered a gentle smile. "Adrian's had rather too much to drink and isn't feeling well. He's resting upstairs. Would you mind checking on him?"

Unsuspecting, Vivian nodded and ascended the grand staircase. The Blackwood estate maintained a permanent suite for them on the second floor, its door slightly ajar.

"Adrian?" she called softly, rapping lightly on the doorframe.

When no answer came, she pushed the door wider and stepped inside. The expansive foyer concealed the room beyond from immediate view. Moving forward, she found Adrian bent over, rummaging through a cabinet.
###Chapter 183

The sudden noise made Adrian jolt upright. His brows furrowed as he demanded, "What are you doing here?" The ominous click of the lock echoed through the room.

Vivian gave a wry smile. "Looks like Grandma has her own plans..."

"Hmm?" Confusion flickered across her face.

Before she could process it, Beatrice's voice floated through the door. "Ethan already left, and Adrian certainly shouldn't be driving after drinking. You two should stay the night and leave tomorrow. Get some rest."

Determined, Vivian rushed to the door, rattling the knob and pounding urgently. "Beatrice? I just need some water!"

Only silence answered her. With a resigned sigh, Adrian gently closed the cabinet door and sank onto the edge of the bed. "Grandma tricked me into coming up here under false pretenses."

Frustrated yet amused, Vivian collapsed onto the facing couch. "She sent me to keep an eye on you too."

Their eyes met, and they burst into laughter, fully appreciating Beatrice's elaborate scheme.

Vivian broke the silence first. "I'll take the sofa tonight."

The relaxed atmosphere instantly turned tense. Adrian carelessly tossed his jacket over a chair. "Ever wonder what might happen if we shared the bed?" he asked, eyebrow arched.

Vivian pressed her lips together, the heavy silence speaking volumes. His recent strange behavior made the question feel completely out of character.

Noticing her discomfort, Adrian's expression turned serious. "Even if something did happen, it would be within marital bounds," he stated firmly.

"Coercion is still assault, no matter how you dress it up," Vivian countered calmly.

"Must you always twist my words?" Adrian challenged through clenched teeth.

Then his frown transformed into a smirk as he remembered her friend's joke. "Audrey said you've never enjoyed the... benefits of marriage. Now that they're available, what's stopping you?"

He leaned back against the headboard, palms propping him up. The casual pose couldn't hide his chiseled jawline or the tempting bob of his Adam's apple - undeniable proof of his rugged charm.

In that moment, Vivian realized with startling clarity that seduction knew no gender - a tactic as effective for men as it had been for women through the ages.

Completely overwhelmed, Vivian couldn't counter Adrian's relentless advances. Her cheeks burned scarlet, undoubtedly influenced by Audrey's teasing about marital privileges. Giving up, she curled into a ball on the couch and lost herself in funny videos.

The exaggerated antics on screen captured her attention completely, drawing uncontrollable laughter. She tried muffling her giggles with her hand, but they bubbled out anyway.

###Chapter 184

The dim glow of the bedside lamp cast long shadows across the room as Adrian lay propped against the pillows, his stormy gaze following Vivian's every move. His jaw tightened with barely concealed frustration when another soft knock interrupted the tense silence.

"Vivian? Are you both still awake?" Beatrice's voice carried through the door, laced with poorly disguised curiosity. The question hung in the air like an unspoken accusation.

Vivian exhaled sharply through her nose, her fingers tightening around her phone. She'd had enough of Beatrice's meddling for one night. Family harmony be damned - she refused to play along this time.

"We're up," she answered flatly, abandoning the plush sofa cushions with visible reluctance. The door swung open before her fingers touched the knob.

Beatrice's sharp eyes swept over Vivian's fully clothed form, her face falling into an expression of profound disappointment. With a dismissive wave, she summoned a maid carrying an ornate silver tray.

"I brought honey milk for Adrian," Beatrice announced with forced cheer, "and fish maw milk for you, Vivian. It'll help you sleep." Her smile didn't reach her eyes.

"Thank you, Beatrice." Vivian accepted the tray with stiff politeness.

The older woman didn't linger, closing the door with an audible click of the lock. The sound echoed through the room like a prison gate slamming shut.

Shaking her head, Vivian placed Adrian's drink on his nightstand. "Your grandmother's special recipe," she said dryly before retreating to her makeshift bed on the sofa.

The rich aroma of her own drink made her mouth water. The luxurious fish maw, simmered to perfection in fresh milk with just a hint of rock sugar, was worlds away from the instant noodles that usually stocked her pantry. Each velvety sip reminded her of the privileges money could buy - and how desperately she wanted to reclaim that independence.

Adrian watched her with unusual interest, his fingers twitching toward her bowl. "That good? Let me taste."

"Get your own," Vivian shot back, protectively cradling the bowl as she devoured the last precious bites.

His lips thinned as he drained his honey milk in one long swallow, slamming the empty cup down with more force than necessary. "People would think the Blackwoods starve you," he remarked, barely stopping himself from comparing her to a rabid dog guarding its meal.

Despite the satisfying meal, an odd restlessness prickled under Vivian's skin. She longed for a cool shower and the oblivion of sleep, but Adrian's brooding presence made both impossible.

Scrolling through her phone provided little distraction. A strange heat was building inside her, spreading through her limbs like liquid fire. She tugged at the hem of her skirt, hoping the night air would soothe her flushed skin, but the discomfort only intensified.

The room seemed to shrink around them, the walls pressing closer with each passing minute. Vivian's breath came faster now, her fingers trembling against her phone screen. Something was very wrong.

Adrian's sharp inhale told her he felt it too. His usually composed features had taken on a dangerous edge, his knuckles white where they gripped the sheets. Their eyes met across the shadowed room - and in that charged moment, they both understood.

The drinks had been spiked.
###Chapter 185

Vivian exhaled sharply, turning toward Adrian with an unfinished sentence hanging between them. "Were you planning to—"

Her words dissolved as she found him studying her with an intensity that felt like a physical touch.

Normally, Vivian despised his loveless advances, yet now an unfamiliar heat unfurled in her core, awakening desires she'd never acknowledged.

She fidgeted, her cheeks flushing as embarrassment prickled her skin. This sudden craving confused her. Though her mind urged restraint, her body responded with undeniable hunger. Avoiding his gaze, she swallowed hard. "If you're not showering, I will. This heat is unbearable."

Her lips parted slightly, her voice softening unintentionally—almost like an invitation. Without warning, Adrian closed the distance, caging her against the sofa with his arms. His warm breath carried traces of whiskey, making her head spin as if she'd been drinking too. Every angle of his face—from the sharp jawline to those hypnotic eyes—was devastatingly perfect.

Her breath caught when she realized their lips were mere inches apart. Memories of their past rushed through her—none particularly tender, yet now the thought of his mouth on hers sent molten need through her veins. Logic screamed for retreat, but primal desire held her captive. The air between them crackled with tension, her pulse pounding so loudly it drowned all reason.

Almost unconsciously, she tilted her chin upward. Adrian abruptly straightened, his voice slicing through the haze. "Doesn't this seem odd to you?"

Vivian stiffened, his words dousing her like ice water.

Mortification burned her cheeks as arousal gave way to shame. She shrank into the sofa, wishing to vanish, yet the heat in her core refused to fade.

"The drink," Adrian rasped, his voice thick. "It was tampered with."

"What?" Her wide eyes met his, surprise mingling with lingering hunger in her gaze. The unspoken longing in her expression tested his crumbling control, igniting a matching fire within him.

Clenching his fists, he ground out, "Grandmother... she must've added something."

Even through the fog, Vivian understood. Her eyes darted to the empty soup bowl, disbelief flashing across her face. Of course. Someone like her—so guarded—wouldn't surrender to passion without cause. The realization eased some embarrassment.

She pressed trembling hands against Adrian's chest. "I know what to do."

Adrian frowned but stepped back, granting her space. He exhaled sharply. Grandmother meant no harm—he knew that. Whatever she'd used was likely meant to... bridge the gap between them.

Discomfort twisted his gut. Had it really come to this? Needing a spiked drink to connect with his own wife? Without explanation, Vivian grabbed his wrist and pulled him toward the bathroom. Under his questioning stare, she twisted the shower knob, releasing an icy torrent that cascaded instantly.

###Chapter 186

The icy water cascaded over them both, drenching their clothes instantly.

Adrian shuddered violently as the freezing liquid seeped through his shirt, his jaw tightening. "This is your brilliant solution?" he ground out between clenched teeth.

Vivian remained unfazed as she moved toward the bathtub, twisting the faucet to release more cold water.

"It works in all the romance dramas," she stated with clinical detachment. "Cold water suppresses desire. Trust me - I've written enough scripts to know." A faint smirk played on her lips as she added, "Research is part of my job."

The soaked fabric of her dress clung to her body like a second skin, revealing every tantalizing curve with startling clarity.

As she leaned forward to adjust the water flow, the graceful arch of her back and the tempting swell of her hips captured Adrian's attention, stealing the breath from his lungs.

The vision, combined with the relentless heat of the drug still burning through his veins, shattered the last remnants of his restraint.

Adrian's throat worked as he swallowed hard, his control disintegrating as he closed the distance between them.

His large hands found purchase on her waist, fingers pressing deliberately into the damp fabric, the heat of his touch searing through the wet material.

Bending close enough that his breath ghosted over her ear, he growled in a voice rough with need, "Vivian... I need you."

A violent tremor racked Vivian's body, her knees nearly buckling beneath her. She twisted free from Adrian's grasp, hastily kicking off her heels before plunging into the half-filled tub with desperate urgency.

Curling into herself, she let the frigid water rise to her collarbones, but it did nothing to quench the firestorm raging within her - a dizzying paradox of ice and flame.

Adrian's gaze burned into her with predatory intensity, the hunger in his dark eyes threatening to devour her whole.

Rational thought abandoned him, consumed by primal need. He no longer cared whether it was the drug or something more profound - all that mattered was claiming her. She was his wife. Why should he resist?

With that realization, he reached for her, pulling her effortlessly into his arms. His voice dropped to a velvet murmur. "This won't work. You'll only catch pneumonia."

His hands moved with purpose - one arm locking around her waist while the other slipped beneath the soaked hem of her skirt, tracing upward along the curve of her thigh.

The familiar spice of his cologne, now laced with something darker and more intoxicating, overwhelmed her senses.

Just as she felt herself surrendering to the moment, a bitter thought surfaced.

Her voice trembled with barely concealed hurt. "Grandmother's potion must be incredibly potent... to make you want someone you can't stand."
###Chapter 187

"What kind of ridiculous assumption is that?" Adrian retorted, his dark eyebrows drawing together in visible irritation.

Despite the flicker of annoyance crossing his chiseled features, his skilled fingers didn't pause in their task, deftly locating the hidden zipper of her designer gown.

"For two entire years, you've barely glanced my way," Vivian began, her voice trembling with years of pent-up frustration. "You even threw away the silk lingerie I specially picked for you!" The long-buried hurt finally surfaced, raw and undeniable.

Her emerald eyes shimmered with unshed tears, making her delicate features appear even more heartbreakingly beautiful in the dim lighting.

Adrian froze momentarily, the memory flashing through his mind. His voice softened unexpectedly. "That afternoon, Mother was rummaging through our wardrobe. Did you really want her to find those?"

Vivian's anger faltered, replaced by stunned realization. She searched his face. "Two years of marriage without intimacy. If you're not completely uninterested... then is it because you're incapable?"

Adrian's jaw tightened visibly, caught off guard by her bold accusation. "I thought you needed time. We married without courtship - I didn't want our first time to feel like some mechanical obligation," he admitted gruffly, his deep voice dropping lower. "But—"

Vivian opened her mouth to protest further, but Adrian's patience had reached its limit. With one fluid motion, he unzipped her dress and swept her into his powerful arms. Before she could react, his lips captured hers in a searing kiss that stole both her breath and any remaining resistance.

Vivian melted against him, utterly powerless against the intoxicating heat of his kiss, drowning in the overwhelming sensations he evoked.

Just as she grew lightheaded from lack of air, he pulled back slightly, his lips curving into that infuriatingly confident smirk she knew too well. "We'll continue this discussion tomorrow. First, let's settle this question of my... capability."

Vivian's pulse raced wildly, the unfamiliar thrill of anticipation making her both nervous and exhilarated beyond measure.

Adrian carried her effortlessly to their king-sized bed, lowering her onto the silk sheets with surprising gentleness.

The delicate lace of her designer lingerie framed her curves to perfection, creating a vision of breathtaking femininity.

Her porcelain skin flushed pink, droplets from their earlier encounter tracing slow, tantalizing paths down her collarbone.

Under Adrian's scorching gaze, Vivian's blush deepened, instinctively grabbing a corner of the duvet to cover herself in sudden shyness.

Adrian shrugged off his soaked dress shirt with effortless grace, the defined muscles of his torso flexing with the movement. He leaned over her, his husky whisper sending shivers down her spine. "Vivian."

His lips found hers again, this time with deliberate slowness, savoring each touch as if she were the most precious treasure.

His skilled hands moved to the clasp of her bra, releasing it with practiced ease.

The garment fluttered to the floor as his fingertips traced featherlight patterns across her sensitive skin, leaving trails of fire in their wake.

Overwhelmed by the unfamiliar sensations, Vivian clutched at his broad shoulders, her nails digging slightly into his tanned skin.

Adrian's expression softened as he watched her long lashes flutter closed, casting delicate shadows across her flushed cheeks.

###Chapter 188

His breath was warm against her ear, the words barely forming. "Call me." The sound was swallowed by the space between them, earning only a drowsy hum in response.

His fingers flexed against her waist, a playful warning that made her lashes lift. When their gazes met, her eyes were liquid pools reflecting his own hunger.

The second kiss was softer, deliberate. His lips brushed hers as he repeated the demand with aching clarity. "Call me."

"Adrian," she sighed, the name slipping out in a dreamy exhale.

That earned her a smirk. His thumb traced her jawline, tilting her face upward.

"Say it properly, sweetheart."

A Little Weak

Vivian knew any protest now would be theatrical at best.

"Darling," she breathed, the single syllable cracking with unguarded tenderness.

She'd used that endearment a thousand times—in scripted love scenes, during public appearances, even in moments of genuine affection. But never like this. Never with her pulse fluttering at her throat like a trapped bird.

Water droplets slid from her wet hair along her cheekbone. In the mirror of his dark eyes, she saw herself—flushed, trembling, utterly unraveled.

The bathroom air hung thick between them, charged with every ragged inhale and the deafening drumbeat of two hearts synchronizing.

Adrian knew this craving wasn't chemical.

The spiked champagne had been child's play compared to the hell he'd survived years ago—captured during negotiations in Ashford, injected with enough truth serum to drop a bull elephant. He'd stayed conscious by carving symbols into his own flesh with a belt buckle, the agony his only anchor.

That merciless endurance had carved his empire's foothold overseas, earning him equal parts reverence and terror from boardrooms and back alleys alike.

His grip tightened as he searched her face. "Tell me who I am."

"You're Adrian," Vivian whispered, the words honey-thick. "My husband."

Heat licked through her veins, unbearable and exquisite. Only his touch could quench this fire.

Her answer sent primal satisfaction coursing through him. Here, now, there were no roles to play. Just her skin against his, her breath mingling with his, her surrender as devastating as his need.

His fingers combed through her damp strands, tracing the shell of her ear before claiming her mouth again.

This kiss was different—hungrier, deeper, as if he could devour the very air from her lungs.

###Chapter 189

Vivian's breath caught in her throat as an unbidden whimper escaped her lips, her body arching instinctively toward Adrian's touch.

His fingers worked with deliberate precision, sliding the silk negligee from her shoulders before lifting her thigh to position himself at her entrance.

A sudden flash of pain made her gasp sharply, her nails digging into his shoulders before she could stop herself.

Adrian stilled immediately, capturing her startled cry with a deep, soothing kiss that melted her tension away.

The way he held back, the careful gentleness in his every movement, unraveled something primal in her core.

Driven by equal parts desire and devotion, she tangled her fingers in his dark hair, her ankles locking behind his back to pull him impossibly closer.

Her enthusiastic response shattered the last vestiges of his self-control.

The bedroom filled with the heady scent of their passion as their bodies discovered an ancient rhythm made new again.

Adrian moved with desperate intensity, as if starved for the taste of her, each thrust more urgent than the last.

At first, Vivian reveled in the waves of pleasure, but soon the sensations became almost too much to bear.

When it was over, she lay boneless against the sheets, surrendering completely to his possessive embrace.

Drowsy with satisfaction, she floated between consciousness and sleep, cresting wave after wave of aftershocks that left her trembling.

She awoke to golden sunset light painting the bedroom walls in amber hues.

The space beside her was empty, yet the very air still vibrated with the echoes of their passion.

Every trace of their earlier abandon had been carefully erased - the bed remade, her clothes neatly folded.

Disoriented, she reached for the duvet, convinced only minutes had passed since dawn.

"Good, you're awake." Adrian's voice cut through her haze as he emerged from the ensuite, a towel slung low around his hips. "Dinner's waiting. Clean up and meet me downstairs."

The sight of water droplets trailing down his sculpted torso brought the afternoon's activities rushing back, heating her cheeks.

Vivian averted her gaze, suddenly fascinated by the bedspread. "It's evening already? Why didn't you—"

"Nobody disturbed us." He nodded toward the empty snack tray on the nightstand. "Sustained myself on those lemon biscuits around noon."

Her eyes narrowed in playful suspicion. "All of them?"

"Needed fuel for my cleaning spree," he deadpanned, shrugging one shoulder.

Her attention drifted to the laptop glowing softly on the bedside table, its screen frozen on a financial report nearly completed.

###Chapter 190

Every muscle in Vivian's body protested as she tried to move. The memories of last night's passion made her want to burrow deeper into the plush bedding. Yet Adrian moved about the room with infuriating ease, already dressed for the day.

She huffed, tossing the silk sheets aside with determination. But the moment her feet touched the cold marble floor, her knees gave way.

Adrian's strong arms caught her before she could fall, his grip firm yet gentle.

Blushing furiously, Vivian muttered, "My legs seem to have forgotten how to work..."

A smug grin played on Adrian's lips. Vivian met his arrogant expression with a mischievous spark in her emerald eyes.

"Me As Your Driver"

Forcing a haughty smile, Vivian arched an eyebrow. "Don't flatter yourself. I must be coming down with something."

Adrian let out a dry chuckle, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "Your enthusiasm last night suggested otherwise."

Vivian refused to yield. "That was just the champagne talking."

The smile vanished from Adrian's face.

His sharp mind raced through every detail of their passionate night. Normally, his analytical skills left no room for doubt. But this unfamiliar territory made him question - was there truth to her words?

For the first time in his life, uncertainty clouded his judgment.

Seizing his hesitation, Vivian hobbled toward the ensuite bathroom. As the door clicked shut, flashes of their heated encounter replayed in her mind, mixing with guilt over their earlier argument.

Thirty minutes later, they descended the grand staircase in tense silence, maintaining careful distance between them.

Leonard sat at the breakfast table reading the financial times, while Beatrice greeted them with knowing eyes. Margaret was noticeably absent.

"Vivian darling," Beatrice patted the chair beside her, "come sit by me."

The matriarch didn't need confirmation to understand what had transpired between the newlyweds.

A maid appeared with a steaming bowl of herbal soup. Beatrice gestured, "Place it before Vivian. It's our family's secret recipe - excellent for restoring energy."

Vivian's cheeks flushed pink, momentarily speechless.

The implication was clear - Beatrice already anticipated a great-grandchild. Noticing Adrian's self-satisfied smirk, Vivian calmly took another bowl and slid it toward him. "You should have some too, darling. Must be exhausting being so... vigorous."

As Adrian reached for it, Vivian leaned in, whispering just loud enough for him to hear, "Natural remedies work better than relying on... temporary solutions."

Not only had she questioned his prowess, but now she'd struck at his pride.
###Chapter 191

The tension between them was palpable as Adrian forced a tight smile. "Thank you, darling," he said through clenched teeth. Perfection had always been his standard, yet here was his wife constantly outshining him in their most intimate moments.

Leonard and Beatrice exchanged knowing glances, mistaking their heated exchange for playful marital banter. The dining room fell into an uneasy silence, each occupant lost in private thoughts.

As dessert plates were cleared, Beatrice turned to them with hopeful eyes. "Must you leave so soon? Stay another night."

Vivian shook her head gently. "I wish we could, Beatrice, but my script revisions can't wait."

Adrian dabbed his lips with a linen napkin, his tone deceptively light. "And I've got that merger presentation tomorrow. My team expects my full attention."

The constant one-upmanship from Vivian left Adrian craving solitude.

Beatrice's voice trembled slightly. "Promise you'll visit more often? This old house echoes with just Leonard and me."

Vivian hesitated before offering a polite nod. "We'll try."

Beatrice signaled a maid who brought forth an insulated cooler. "These are my special herbal tonics - keep them chilled. When you run out, I'll send more."

"Thank you," Vivian reached out.

But Beatrice bypassed her, placing the package directly into Adrian's hands. "You're driving Vivian to her office, yes?"

Vivian opened her mouth to object when Adrian cut in sharply. "Would you rather walk through that downpour and end up bedridden again?" Her protest died on her lips.

After farewells were exchanged, they stepped into the torrential rain.

Vivian moved toward the backseat when Adrian's icy glare stopped her. "Do I look like your chauffeur?"

She slid wordlessly into the passenger seat, jaw clenched.

Adrian navigated the sleek sedan away from Blackwood Estate in silence. Midway through the drive, Vivian suddenly pointed. "The courthouse."

Adrian glanced at the neoclassical building. "Indeed it is," he mused, remembering their rushed marriage license three years prior.

In Northshire tradition, the third anniversary symbolized toughened leather - a relationship tested by time. In Azurevale culture, it represented golden wheat - the fruitful harvest of partnership.

As Adrian contemplated anniversary plans, Vivian's voice sliced through his thoughts. "Pull over. We're filing for divorce."

The tires screeched against wet pavement as the luxury car jerked to a stop.

Rain pounded against the windshield like a thousand accusing fingers.

The space between them had never felt wider.

The leather seats creaked as Vivian reached for the door handle.

Adrian's hand shot out, gripping her wrist with surprising gentleness. "Talk to me," he demanded, his voice rough with uncharacteristic vulnerability.

Vivian froze, her reflection in the rain-streaked window showing eyes bright with unshed tears. "Three years is enough pretending, don't you think?"

The storm outside mirrored the tempest between them.

Adrian's grip tightened imperceptibly. "What if I don't want to pretend anymore?"

The words hung in the air like a challenge.

Like a promise.

Like a new beginning.
###Chapter 192

Adrian spun around, his stormy gaze darkening to midnight. "What did you just say?"

"What the hell are you doing?" Vivian snapped.

Her jaw set like tempered steel as she enunciated each word. "I said we're passing the family court. Let's get this divorce finalized today. No point prolonging the inevitable."

The car screeched to a halt so abruptly that only her seatbelt kept her from hitting the dashboard.

Adrian's knuckles whitened around the steering wheel, the air between them thickening with unspoken tension. The irony wasn't lost on him - discussing divorce mere hours after their first night together.

When he remained silent, Vivian arched a perfectly sculpted brow. "Problem, Mr. Blackwood? This was the agreement. Having second thoughts? Or was last night your maiden voyage?"

"Don't be ridiculous."

She'd expected nothing less. Given his undying devotion to Serena, virginity had clearly been sacrificed long ago. Not that it mattered now. Nothing did.

"Then we're done here," she said, ice coating every syllable. "Let's wrap this up. I know how precious your time is."

The leather seats creaked as Adrian shifted, his profile carved from marble. After an eternity, he ground out, "Courthouse is closed."

Vivian tapped her phone screen. "It's barely five. They're open."

"I don't have the marriage license," he countered, his voice colder than a midwinter storm.

Her laugh held no mirth. "Since when do we need paperwork to end this farce?"

Adrian's lips twisted into something resembling a smile. "Eager, aren't we?" He nodded toward her device. "Google it yourself."

She checked the time again, undaunted. "Plenty of time. We can swing by your penthouse - what's that, three minutes? Or better yet, call Gwendolyn to messenger it over—"

The insistent buzz of his phone cut through her words like a guillotine.

That saccharine voice oozed through the speakers before he'd fully answered. "Adrian..."

Vivian's spine straightened at Serena's unmistakable purr.

Adrian kept his eyes fixed on the traffic ahead. "What's wrong? Are you hurt?"

"Just lonely," came the breathy reply. "I found this divine little bistro overlooking the harbor. Join me for dinner?"

"On my way." The call ended before Vivian could blink. He turned to her with clinical detachment. "I have prior commitments. You'll need to arrange your own transportation."

For three heartbeats, Vivian simply stared. Then, with a derisive snort, she unbuckled the seatbelt and stepped onto the curb. The door slammed with finality as she leaned down for one parting shot through the glass.

###Chapter 193

"Mr. Blackwood, your appetite is truly remarkable. Just finished dining at the estate and already hunting for your next meal? Be warned—some delicacies might prove too rich for your stomach."

Her voice lashed out like a silver dagger, each syllable honed to perfection.

Adrian's expression darkened, but he refused to take the bait. "That's hardly your concern," he countered icily, pressing the accelerator and leaving Vivian standing in swirling dust.

As the sleek car vanished down the boulevard, realization struck Vivian like a slap—Beatrice's precious health supplements still sat abandoned in the backseat.

Snatching her phone, she dialed Adrian with trembling fingers. "My supplements are still in your car."

His mocking laughter crackled through the receiver. "So eager to storm out empty-handed, yet clinging to those trivial gifts now?"

"They're none of your business," she hissed. "Beatrice gave them to me personally. Return them immediately."

"Not my priority," Adrian dismissed before the line went dead.

Vivian exhaled sharply, kicking a stray pebble with unnecessary force. That infuriating man would be the death of her!

A smooth, amused voice interrupted her fuming. "Who dares trouble such a vision of beauty?"

She whirled to find Maxwell Sterling leaning against a lamppost, casually swirling a bottle of sparkling water. The neon glow of the 24-hour convenience store painted his sharp features in artificial light.

"Mr. Sterling," she greeted, smoothing her expression into practiced serenity. "Just an inconsiderate driver with terrible manners. Nearly ran me over without a second glance."

Her smile bloomed like a hothouse rose—perfectly cultivated yet devoid of genuine warmth. The icy glint in her eyes betrayed none of her inner turmoil.

Maxwell played along with theatrical concern. "Road manners have certainly deteriorated these days."

"Indeed." Vivian's response was clipped. "What brings you to this neighborhood, Mr. Sterling?"

Two coincidental meetings in as many days? Her instincts screamed warning. Was this deliberate?

"Pure serendipity," he lied effortlessly, shaking his water bottle. "Craving a late supper but can't decide where. Thought I'd hydrate while contemplating my options."

Though he maintained the charade of chance, Maxwell had lingered long enough to catch Vivian's heated exchange with Adrian. The puzzle pieces clicked into place—their picture-perfect marriage displayed during the Emberglow County gala had been pure theater.

Vivian's palpable distrust confirmed his suspicions. No devoted husband would abandon his wife alone on dimly lit streets. Perhaps those divorce rumors Natasha had whispered held more truth than fiction.

Before she could formulate an excuse, Maxwell advanced with polished charm. "Since fate keeps throwing us together, might I tempt you to join me for dinner, my elusive muse?"

Vivian took a subtle step back, widening the space between them. "I've just come from dinner at Blackwood Estate," she declined, emphasizing the location like armor.

"Blackwood Estate?" Maxwell's gaze swept the urban surroundings with exaggerated confusion. "This is at least twelve miles from the estate grounds. Did you walk here alone? Where is your devoted husband?"
###Chapter 194

A faint blush colored Vivian's cheeks as she smoothed back a loose curl. "Adrian dropped me off before going to work. I wanted to walk, let my dinner settle, maybe find some creative inspiration under the stars."

Maxwell seized the opening. "Then you must see the lounge at Crestwood Tower. Breathtaking city views, exquisite dessert cocktails. I saved you once - surely you owe me at least one dinner?"

Refusing would seem churlish. Even if Maxwell wasn't actively following her, his relentless generosity hinted at ulterior motives. This might be her chance to uncover his true agenda.

Vivian's smile was carefully measured. "If you insist, then dinner's my treat. Shall we call a car?"

"My ride's right here," Maxwell gestured, revealing a gleaming emerald Bentley.

As Vivian buckled in, an eerie prickling sensation traveled up her spine. She scanned the lively street through tinted windows but detected nothing unusual.

Crestwood Tower dominated the metropolitan skyline, its 160 floors piercing the clouds. A commercial colossus housing everything from Michelin-starred restaurants to exclusive boutiques, crowned by an observation deck offering panoramic urban vistas.

Maxwell escorted Vivian to the 150th floor, where astronomical rents permitted only a single French fine-dining establishment. The space exuded opulence, transforming mere sustenance into a symphony of refined indulgence.

Hand-cut crystal chandeliers shimmered like captured constellations, their quality distinguishing them from mass-produced imitations. Delicate lampshades projected aquatic light patterns across walls, creating an immersive underwater ambiance. A pianist in champagne silk coaxed melodies from a white grand piano, her notes floating through the air like spun sugar.

"The usual private dining room," Maxwell informed the waiter with quiet authority. "My companion wishes to enjoy the skyline."

The waiter maintained professional composure despite his apologetic tone. "My sincerest regrets, Mr. Sterling. That room is currently reserved."

Annoyance flickered across Maxwell's features. He glanced at Vivian before addressing the waiter with thinly veiled irritation. "Any available room with a view will suffice."

"Unfortunately all view rooms are booked this evening. We only have interior alcoves or main dining available."

Vivian, eager to avoid private quarters, interjected smoothly. "The main dining room sounds lovely."

Maxwell acquiesced with a nod. "Very well. The main dining room then."

"Right this way," the waiter gestured gracefully toward their table.

As they followed, Maxwell indicated the coveted private room. "That one has the same vantage as the observation deck. I'll reserve it properly for our next visit."

The waiter added discreetly, "Tonight's guest reserved twenty-four hours in advance. Quite an important figure."

Maxwell scoffed quietly. "Important enough to brave Crestwood Tower on a Friday night? Don't these celebrities worry about causing pandemonium?"
###Chapter 195

The upscale restaurant maintained impeccable discretion about its VIP patrons. The maître d' led Maxwell and Vivian to a secluded table by the floor-to-ceiling windows, offering a discreet nod before withdrawing.

Vivian's quiet sophistication commanded attention, her poise rivaling the cascading crystal droplets of the chandelier above them.

Maxwell observed her with keen interest, sensing a subtle metamorphosis in her aura. His gaze traveled over her conservative ensemble - a high-necked blouse with flowing sleeves paired with wide-leg trousers. Though her attire concealed everything but her face and hands, an undeniable radiance emanated from her.

As she tilted her chin to peruse the menu, Maxwell's sharp eyes caught a faint bruise peeking above her collar. His pulse quickened.

He knew those marks intimately. The pieces clicked together - Vivian's earlier tension with Adrian now made perfect sense. This wasn't merely anger; something fundamental had shifted within her. She carried herself differently, as though she'd crossed some invisible threshold into womanhood.

Unbidden, his mind conjured vivid images of Vivian and Adrian together, wondering about the passion hidden beneath her composed exterior.

Despite his extensive experience with women, Vivian remained an enigma. Her allure transcended circumstance - from her previous untouchable ice queen persona to her current status as a married woman. Even in her most vulnerable moments, like when he'd rescued her from those thugs, she'd awakened something primal in him.

Since returning from Emberglow County, she'd haunted his dreams relentlessly. His attempts to distract himself with other women only intensified his obsession.

A visceral hunger tightened his throat.

"I'll have the mineral water," Vivian said, closing the leather-bound menu.

Maxwell snapped back to the present, quickly ordering the chef's tasting menu with an assortment of signature desserts. "Their chocolate soufflé is legendary. May I suggest—"

"That's quite excessive," Vivian interrupted gently. "I could never finish all that."

"Consider it a tasting experience," Maxwell countered smoothly. "No need to clean your plate. I derive pleasure from indulging beautiful women."

His mind flashed to Emberglow County when he'd bought her that wardrobe. The cost meant nothing - he'd simply wanted to win her favor effortlessly. Then Adrian had arrived with his obscenely expensive replacements, undermining Maxwell's gesture.

"I dislike extravagance," Vivian said firmly. "Besides, this is my treat, as we agreed."

Maxwell conceded with a practiced smile. "As you wish. We'll have other opportunities."

When the server departed, Vivian met his gaze directly. "Mr. Sterling, while I appreciate your assistance in Emberglow County, I believe we should maintain appropriate boundaries moving forward."

Her meaning couldn't be clearer.

Just as Maxwell opened his mouth to respond, movement caught his eye. A private dining room's door swung open momentarily as a server entered. Through the gap, he glimpsed Adrian seated near the entrance with a female companion, though the woman's face remained obscured by Adrian's broad shoulders.
###Chapter 196

Vivian's fingers tightened around her linen napkin as Maxwell's lips curved into that infuriatingly knowing smile. "Ms. Hartley," he murmured, "are you perhaps laboring under some...misconception about me? Or do you suspect those unfortunate incidents in Emberglow County were part of some elaborate rescue operation I staged?"

The crystal stemware caught the ambient light as Vivian took a deliberate sip of water. "Mr. Sterling," she countered smoothly, "you're imagining things. As a married woman, my actions carry consequences beyond personal whims."

Though every instinct screamed Maxwell had orchestrated those attacks, proof remained elusive. Accusations without evidence would only entangle her further in his web.

The arrival of their courses provided temporary respite. Maxwell, ever the picture of aristocratic grace, selected several desserts for her with theatrical care. "Let's not spoil such exquisite cuisine with unpleasantness," he suggested, his smile as polished as the silverware.

Vivian's attention drifted to the dessert presentation - a soufflé sculpted into an intricate magnolia blossom, its petals dusted with gold leaf and drizzled with lavender-infused honey. The first bite released a burst of blackberry compote, its tartness perfectly offsetting the vanilla bean richness.

Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, Crestwood glittered like a spilled jewelry box. The city's meteoric rise owed much to the Blackwood dynasty, with Adrian's influence woven through every gleaming skyscraper.

Her breath caught mid-sip when the glass reflected a familiar silhouette. Adrian emerged from a private dining room, his arm occupied by a willowy figure in ivory silk. Though the wide-brimmed hat and Venetian mask obscured her features, the way Serena Whitmore clung to Adrian's sleeve - that childish, possessive grip - was unmistakable.

Adrian didn't shake her off. His expression held that same indulgent resignation Vivian remembered from their university days, when Serena's theatrics commanded center stage.

She turned back to her plate too quickly, rattling the silverware. Too late. Maxwell's gaze had followed hers, his eyes now brimming with performative sympathy.

"Why persist with this charade of strength?" he murmured, reaching across the table. "We were nearly married once, Vivian. Doesn't our reunion after all these years feel...fated?"

Vivian recoiled so violently her chair screeched against the marble. The disturbance earned disapproving glances from nearby diners, which Maxwell acknowledged with an apologetic smile. "Forgive us," he announced smoothly, "my fiancée's rather temperamental tonight."

The lie hung between them like poisoned mist. Vivian's pulse hammered against her ribs - not from heartbreak, but rage. That Adrian's indiscretion should play out before Maxwell Sterling of all people...

Her untouched soufflé collapsed in on itself, the delicate structure ruined. Like her carefully constructed composure. Like the fragile détente in her marriage.

Maxwell's fingers brushed hers again, insistent as a creditor's reminder. "Let me take care of you," he whispered, and the threat beneath the promise sent ice down her spine.
###Chapter 197

The tension in the air was palpable as their gazes locked across the table.

Maxwell's careless remark sent shivers down Vivian's spine. Her voice turned glacial. "How generous of you, Mr. Sterling. But let me remind you - Adrian and I are legally bound. Surely a man of your standing wouldn't stoop to being the other man?"

His smirk never wavered. "For you," he purred, "I might make an exception."

Vivian's composure shattered. She rose abruptly, her eyes flashing with steel. "Your past assistance is appreciated, Mr. Sterling. But this ends now. Any scandal wouldn't just tarnish my reputation - your family's upcoming IPO would suffer too. Bad press isn't what investors want to see."

Her calculated words revealed thorough research. Since returning from Emberglow County, Vivian had investigated the Sterling family. While she lacked resources for deep digging, she'd uncovered enough leverage.

Maxwell's casual posture stiffened. The charming facade cracked, revealing something predatory beneath. "Is that a threat, Vivian? Who do you think will protect you? Your father? Adrian?" His lips curled. "The Blackwoods always prioritize business. Now that Adrian's reunited with Serena, do you think he'd risk his position for you? My family may not equal the Blackwood Group, but we're powerful enough to make him hesitate."

Vivian planted her palms on the table, leaning into his venomous stare. "I protect myself. And when you've got nothing left to lose, you fear nothing. In this digital age, public opinion destroys empires. Would your father appreciate you provoking a scorned woman and endangering the Sterling name?"

Her challenge hung between them, the last pretense of civility evaporating. Straightening, she offered a frosty smile. "I'll take care of the check. Goodbye, Mr. Sterling."

"Permanently," she added silently.

Maxwell remained seated, his handsome features twisting into something ugly.

Though he didn't follow, his darkened expression promised retribution.

At the counter, Vivian's fingers trembled slightly as she paid. Only when she stepped into the night air did she realize she'd abandoned most of her dessert.

Returning wasn't worth further confrontation. Some sacrifices, she told herself, prevented greater disasters.

With a heavy heart, she walked away.

Nearby, shocked eyes tracked her departure.

Dominic watched until Vivian disappeared into the shadows. Turning to his companions, disbelief etched his features. "Tell me I'm hallucinating. Was that really Adrian's wife just now?"

Adrian and Serena had left moments before Dominic and his friends entered through the side entrance.

His friends' confirming nods spoke volumes.
###Chapter 198

"That was definitely Vivian," one of Dominic's companions whispered.

"And the guy with her? Maxwell Sterling from the Sterling family," another confirmed.

Dominic's face darkened instantly. His fist slammed onto the marble tabletop with a loud crack. "That bastard actually called her his girlfriend! What about Adrian? If he's messing with my best friend's woman, he'll answer to me!"

But when Dominic scanned the upscale restaurant, Maxwell's seat stood empty. The waitstaff had already cleared the champagne glasses and dessert plates, leaving no trace of the man who'd ignited his fury.

His friends quickly restrained him, pulling him back into his plush chair.

"Dom, think before you act," cautioned one.

Another chuckled nervously. "If you cause a scene here, people might think you're the jealous boyfriend."

The voice of reason came from his left. "This isn't something you can handle with fists. If you want to deal with Maxwell, it has to be Adrian's call. Otherwise, you'll just make things worse for Vivian."

Dominic exhaled sharply through his nose. "Fine." He yanked out his phone, fingers stabbing at Adrian's contact.

The first call rang twice before disconnecting. The second met the same fate. By the third attempt, Dominic's jaw clenched tight enough to crack teeth.

On the fourth try, Adrian finally answered.

"Adrian! Where the hell have you—"

"Make it quick." Adrian's voice carried that dangerous calm Dominic knew too well.

Dominic swallowed hard. "I just saw Vivian having dinner with Maxwell Sterling. The bastard introduced her as his girlfriend!"

Before he could continue, a feminine voice floated through the receiver. "Adrian darling, have you seen my silk chemise?"

Dominic froze. The implications hit him like a freight train—Adrian ignoring his calls, a woman's voice asking about lingerie, the hushed background suggesting an intimate setting. Adrian and Serena were together.

Memories flashed through Dominic's mind—how Adrian had always treated Serena more like a sister during their relationship, never showing physical affection in public. Their dynamic had never seemed... passionate.

But now? Lingerie? The mental image made Dominic's stomach twist.

"I—I have to go," Dominic stammered, abruptly ending the call before Adrian could respond. His fingers trembled slightly as he pocketed his phone, the restaurant's ambient chatter suddenly deafening.
###Chapter 199

Had he been completely wrong? Did Adrian truly not care about Vivian at all?

Inside the luxury car, Adrian rummaged through several designer shopping bags before pulling out one containing delicate lingerie. He handed it to Serena with an absentminded gesture.

"Thank you, darling," Serena purred, cradling the package like a prized possession. "This is hand-stitched French lace - it mustn't be folded."

A triumphant gleam flashed in her eyes as she hugged the bag tighter. She'd carefully orchestrated Dominic's misunderstanding, knowing his vivid imagination would work in her favor.

Adrian barely registered her presence, his mind consumed by Dominic's revelation. After a tense silence, he grabbed his phone and dialed Vivian's number.

When she answered, his voice was glacial. "What were you doing alone with Maxwell?"

Vivian's retort came sharp as shattered crystal. "Mr. Blackwood, your hypocrisy is astounding! You abandoned me for a romantic evening with Serena, yet expect me to wait like some pathetic stray? I'll see whomever I please. Our divorce papers are practically signed - my company is none of your concern."

Her words carried the sting of betrayal, yet her tone remained eerily composed, as if discussing a stranger's affairs.

Before Adrian could respond, Serena interrupted, holding up a small velvet pouch. "Adrian, do you enjoy bird's nest soup?"

Adrian glanced distractedly. "Not particularly. My grandmother insists on preparing it."

"With rock sugar and goji berries!" Serena exclaimed, peering into the pouch with theatrical delight. "My favorite! Though my chef never gets the consistency right. May I?"

She batted her eyelashes expectantly.

Adrian gave a curt nod. "Take it."

The intimate exchange between them pierced Vivian's heart like shards of glass. Without another word, she ended the call.

Standing beneath the flickering streetlights, Vivian pulled her coat tighter against the howling wind. The cold penetrated deeper than the winter chill - it was the realization that Adrian's warmth had never been meant for her. As the wind whipped strands of hair across her face, the city lights blurred into watery streaks.

Meanwhile, in the VIP lounge of Mirage Lounge, decadence oozed from every velvet-draped corner. Men in tailored suits and women in barely-there dresses draped themselves across plush banquettes, their laughter drowning in the clink of crystal glasses.

Maxwell Sterling lounged like a predator in his corner throne, boots propped arrogantly on the ebony coffee table. Two cocktail waitresses in sequined minidresses attended to his every whim - one refilling his whiskey while the other held a lighter to his cigar.

His lips curled into a cruel smirk as he trailed fingers down one girl's cheek before abruptly upending his drink down her décolletage.

The girl gasped, shock flashing across her face for only a heartbeat before she forced a sultry pout. "If you wanted me wet, Mr. Sterling, the penthouse pool would be more...thorough."

Maxwell chuckled darkly, pinching her chin. "Cheeky. I like that." He pulled out his phone and transferred an obscene tip, taking out his frustration from the earlier confrontation with Vivian on these paid companions.
###Chapter 200

The air in the private booth was thick with cigar smoke and expensive cologne.

Maxwell Sterling flicked ash into a crystal tray, his cold gaze following the retreating figure of the cocktail waitress. "Clean yourself up. I won't have your filth staining my Tom Ford," he drawled, exhaling a perfect smoke ring.

The girl forced a practiced smile as she backed out of the VIP section. The moment the velvet curtains swished shut behind her, her face twisted in disgust. "Miserable bastard," she hissed, plucking at her ruined designer dress.

At Mirage Lounge, where bottles cost more than most people's rent, his tip had been downright insulting.

Her mind drifted to Adrian Blackwood - untouchable, impeccably dressed, never sparing her a second glance, but always leaving generous stacks of crisp bills.

Being assigned to Maxwell's table tonight was cosmic punishment.

Inside the private booth, the atmosphere shifted. A weasel-faced man with greasy hair leaned across the marble table, his fingers digging into his companion's thigh. "Max, you're a fucking visionary," he cackled.

"That whole white knight routine? Pure gold!" His beady eyes nearly disappeared when he laughed, giving him the permanent look of a sewer rat.

Maxwell shrugged off his Brioni jacket with a smirk. "Child's play. I don't bother with amateur theatrics."

Another man - Maxwell's head of security since prep school - nodded appreciatively. "Timing was flawless. We even tipped off the Emberglow County sheriff to sell the illusion."

Maxwell swirled the amber liquid in his tumbler before draining it. "Went there planning to fuck her and forget her." The glass hit the table with a sharp crack. "Imagine my surprise finding the precious Vivian Hartley slumming it at a budget motel."

His knuckles whitened around the empty glass. "Then those street rats appeared like divine intervention. Perfect setup for my grand entrance." A muscle ticked in his jaw. "Instead of gratitude? She looked at me like I was the threat."

One of his cronies snorted. "Still hung up on the Blackwood name, huh? Now that Serena's back from Paris..."

Maxwell's eyes darkened like storm clouds. "If she won't accept my generosity willingly, I'll make her beg." The thought of breaking Vivian's defiance sent heat coiling through his veins.

Without warning, he grabbed the nearest girl, ripping her blouse open with a sickening tear. The others barely glanced up as he shoved her onto the leather couch, their laughter and the thumping bass masking the vulgar sounds.

Next morning.
Film set.

Vivian stepped out of her town car onto the bustling studio lot. Before she could take three steps, a swarm of crew members descended upon her.

"Vivian! Thank god you're here!"

The first AD thrust a revised script into her hands while her makeup team descended with brushes and powder puffs. Through the chaos, she caught sight of a familiar black Maybach pulling through the gates - Adrian Blackwood had arrived.
###Chapter 201

The afternoon sun cast golden hues across the set as Sebastian approached, his signature grin in place. He carried a carefully wrapped package that smelled divine. "My cousin prepared these smoked beef strips—five different flavors! You get first pick, Vivian."

After weeks of filming together, the crew had become familiar with her preferences. "Come on, Vivian, choose quickly!" someone called out. "We've been salivating since breakfast!"

Isabella, the makeup artist, rolled her eyes dramatically. "Honestly, Sebastian wouldn't let anyone near them until you'd selected yours." Vivian chuckled as she accepted the parcel.

Inside lay five airtight containers, each meticulously labeled. When Sebastian opened one, the rich scent of smoked meat and secret spices made everyone's mouths water.

Vivian's stomach rumbled audibly as she sampled a piece, savoring the perfect balance of smokiness and spice. Without hesitation, she claimed the extra spicy batch—her absolute favorite—before passing the rest to the eager crew.

Cheers erupted as everyone thanked both Sebastian and Vivian. After all, without their leading lady, who would have gotten them this homemade delicacy?

As laughter filled the air, Vivian's smile faltered when a sudden glint caught her eye. Their outdoor set, though cordoned off, remained exposed to public view, with fans and curious onlookers gathered beyond the barriers.

Her skin prickled with unease as she scanned the perimeter. Something felt... off.

Having distributed the treats, Sebastian rejoined the group, his easy charm lifting everyone's spirits. Isabella paused mid-brushstroke while touching up Vivian's makeup. "You're absolutely radiant today," she murmured sincerely.

Vivian's flawless features and luminous complexion never failed to impress the makeup team.

Moments later, Sebastian returned with a script. "Vivian, about this scene—" He stopped abruptly, noticing her leg resting on a stool.

A faint scar marred her otherwise perfect skin. "What happened here?" Concern etched his features.

Vivian glanced down and shrugged. "Old injury. Isabella will cover it before filming. Not exactly camera-ready."

The pale pink mark stood out against her porcelain skin, though well-healed.

Without warning, Sebastian grabbed the concealer and brush, kneeling to apply it himself.

Vivian immediately blocked him. "Don't! Your fanbase would crucify me if they saw this!"

The moment the words left her lips, an icy shiver ran down her spine. That unsettling sensation of being watched returned with vengeance.

She stood abruptly, striding toward the street's edge, her gaze sharp.

"What's wrong?" Sebastian followed, brow furrowed.

Vivian's eyes darted across the busy thoroughfare. "I keep feeling like someone's photographing me."

###Chapter 202

Sebastian straightened, his tall frame giving him an advantage in scanning the surroundings.

"Nothing unusual in sight. Probably just enthusiastic fans hoping for a glimpse," he said, trying to ease Vivian's nerves.

Vivian gave a distracted nod. "Right, must be."

But the unease clung to her like a second skin, lingering even as she left the studio that evening. Sliding into the backseat of a cab, her phone vibrated violently. Sebastian's name flashed on the screen.

"Where are you?" His voice carried an edge she'd never heard before.

"In a taxi," Vivian answered, watching streetlights blur past. "Nearly home. What's happening?"

"Social media's gone nuclear." His words tumbled out in a frantic rush. "My fault—Harrison already called Lydia. She's handling damage control."

Between his fractured sentences, only two words registered clearly: "social media."

After a quick reassurance, she hung up and opened Twitter.

Her name dominated the trending list:

"Sebastian & Vivian Secret Affair"

"Sebastian Caught Kissing Vivian's Leg"

"Vivian Faking Romance For Clout"

"A-List Star Scandal Erupts"

The attached photos showed mundane moments from Emberglow County and Crestwood shoots—all perfectly professional interactions between co-stars.

One particular image stood out: Vivian seated gracefully on a stool while Sebastian knelt before her. The clever angle created an illusion of intimacy where none existed.

These harmless stills shouldn't have caused an uproar.

Then she saw the comments.

The narrative wasn't about romance—it was character assassination. Someone had weaponized these images to paint her as a scheming opportunist exploiting Sebastian's fame.

The goodwill she'd built with his fans evaporated into toxic outrage. Betrayed supporters lashed out:

"These photos are doctored! I was on set—Sebastian never touched her!"

"Clear setup! He was holding makeup supplies, not kissing her leg!"

"She totally staged this! Look at the unnatural poses!"


###Chapter 203

"I assumed she was just another pretty actress. But she's a viper in disguise. Sebastian helped her, and now she's using him for fame. Who would ever help anyone after this scandal?"

"This whole romance is staged. My yoga instructor and I look more intimate in our group photos!"

"Miss Hartley, we've arrived," the taxi driver announced, snapping Vivian out of her spiraling thoughts.

Vivian glanced up and immediately spotted several shadowy figures loitering near her apartment entrance. Her stomach twisted. Had Sebastian's fans really tracked her down this quickly?

"Driver," she said, massaging her throbbing temples, "could you take me to the underground parking instead?"

As the taxi descended into the dimly lit garage, Vivian stepped out with quick, purposeful strides toward the elevator. Her breath hitched when two strangers—a sharply dressed woman and a broad-shouldered man—materialized before her, blocking her path.

Vivian's pulse quickened as she studied them. The woman, mid-thirties with a practiced smile, spoke first. "Ms. Hartley? Lydia sent us. There are mobs of Sebastian's fans swarming your building. Going upstairs now would be... unwise."

Vivian instinctively retreated a step. "How did you know I'd come through the garage? Lydia knows I don't drive."

The woman's laugh tinkled like wind chimes. "We didn't. But Kingsley Studios provides luxury vehicles for their talent." She gestured to a gleaming black sedan nearby—the same model the studio leased to all their A-list actors.

The man stepped forward, his smile not reaching his cold eyes. "Sebastian contacted Lydia about the media storm. We're here to escort you to safety. When we couldn't reach you, we split up—one watching the lobby, the other your floor."

At Sebastian's name, Vivian's shoulders relaxed slightly. "Are we going to the studio? What's the plan?"

"That's for Lydia to explain," the woman said smoothly, opening the car door. "We're just your escorts."

As they approached the vehicle, Vivian casually asked, "What departments do you work in? I don't recognize you."

The woman's manicured hand rested on the doorframe. "I manage Serena Whitmore's schedule, and he's from crisis PR."

Serena?

Ice flooded Vivian's veins. She halted mid-step. "Wait—who exactly sent you?"

The woman's smile turned brittle. "Ms. Hartley, is there a problem?"

Vivian's gaze darted to the driver—a hulking figure with prison tattoos snaking up his neck.

"Nothing," Vivian lied, already backing away. "I'll just confirm with Lydia first—"

The man's vise-like grip closed around her arm, yanking her toward the open car door with terrifying strength.
###Chapter 204

The man's voice was rough as gravel. "Enough chatter."

"Someone help me!" Vivian's scream bounced off the concrete walls of the parking garage.

In a flash, the woman's friendly mask slipped. She yanked a cleaning rag from the dashboard and forced it into Vivian's mouth, silencing her.

Rough hands twisted rope around her wrists before shoving her between them in the backseat. The man pressed against her left side, the woman on her right.

The female abductor snatched Vivian's phone from her purse, clutching it like a trophy.

"One wrong move," the man warned, "and you'll regret it."

"Easy there," the woman cooed, stroking Vivian's hair with fake tenderness. "We're doing you a favor, sweetheart. Sebastian's fans can be... overzealous. You're better off with us."

They weren't true Sebastian Hartwell devotees. They'd heard of Serena Whitmore but remained oblivious to her feud with Vivian - hence the casual mention.

Neither worked in entertainment nor had ties to Serena...

Vivian's mind raced, narrowing it down to two likely scenarios.

Tires screeched as their car peeled out of the garage. At that exact moment, Lydia's vehicle passed by in the opposite lane. Bound and gagged, Vivian could only watch her last hope disappear in the rearview mirror.

Meanwhile, Lydia stepped off the elevator, heels clicking urgently toward Vivian's apartment door. She pounded three times.

Silence.

No response.

After a tense pause, Lydia keyed in the emergency code Vivian had entrusted to her months ago but never used.

The door revealed a perfectly still apartment. Neatly arranged slippers by the entrance. No signs of recent occupation.

Lydia's stomach dropped as she speed-dialed Vivian.

"Subscriber unavailable," the robotic voice announced.

Her pulse spiked.

She immediately called Sebastian. "Did Viv mention her plans?" she demanded the second he answered.

"Yeah, said she was heading straight home." He checked his call log. "About thirty minutes ago."

Lydia's grip tightened on her phone. "I'm at her place now. She's not here." She paced the foyer. "Phone's off. This isn't right."

"Could be fans," Sebastian suggested. "Remember when that actress trashed me online? Some lunatics camped outside her building for days."

A similar incident had occurred last year when an outspoken critic found her car vandalized with Sebastian Hartwell fan club stickers...

###Chapter 205

Lydia's pulse quickened. "Fans—" The memory of that suspicious group loitering outside the building when she arrived flashed through her mind. They'd scattered the moment her car pulled up.

Though she hadn't witnessed anything overtly alarming, her instincts screamed danger.

A cold dread gripped Lydia's chest. "This isn't right. I need to review the security tapes—Vivian could be in trouble."

The vehicle skidded to a stop at a derelict pier, its rotting planks nearly swallowed by overgrown sea grass. A corroded surveillance camera dangled precariously from its mount, its lens completely obscured by layers of spiderwebs and bird nests. The decaying dock made the gleaming white yacht moored alongside appear almost surreal in its pristine condition.

Vivian was dragged from the car, her captors hauling her aboard the vessel.

Compared to the Blackwood family's extravagant custom yachts, this was practically a dinghy—modest in size, purely functional, probably worth less than a mid-range sports car. It could sleep eight at most, lacking all the luxurious amenities she'd grown accustomed to.

One possibility had already been eliminated—this wasn't retaliation from the remnants of the Emberglow County gang.

As the engines roared to life and the yacht pulled away from shore, Vivian watched the coastline shrink into the horizon. The vast expanse of open water stretched endlessly in every direction.

Would anyone even know where to look for her? Her abductors had planned this meticulously. Out here, rescue seemed like a fantasy.

They shoved her into the main salon where Maxwell Sterling lounged arrogantly on an oversized leather couch. His garish Hawaiian shirt clashed violently with the polished gentleman's persona he'd once maintained.

Maxwell's lips curled into a self-satisfied smirk. "Vivian. What an unexpected pleasure."

Her face remained an impassive mask, eyes like tempered steel.

Undeterred by her silence, he rose and prowled toward her. "No reaction? You're sharper than I gave you credit for."

His gaze traveled insolently down her sleeveless dress, lingering too long on exposed skin. "Then again," he murmured, tracing a finger along her bare arm, "you'd need to be clever to infiltrate the Blackwood family."

Vivian suppressed a shudder, bile rising in her throat.

Noticing the faint rope marks on her wrists, Maxwell chuckled darkly. "So fragile. Even silk leaves its mark on you."

He dug his fingers into the tender flesh, clearly enjoying the way her skin reddened beneath his touch.

Vivian didn't struggle. Against her captors' iron grip, resistance was pointless. Instead, she fixed him with a glacial stare, her silence more cutting than any insult.

Maxwell tilted his head, amused. "Ah yes—the famous Hartley composure." He ripped the gag from her mouth, letting it fall to the teak flooring.

Leaning uncomfortably close, he dragged his thumb across her chapped lips. "Such a perfect little mouth. I wonder what else—"

Vivian jerked her head away, her glare sharp enough to draw blood.
###Chapter 206

Maxwell let out a dark chuckle, withdrawing his hand. "Still as feisty as ever, I see." His voice dripped with sarcasm. "Don't tell me you're actually expecting Adrian to come riding to your rescue?"

Vivian remained silent, her emerald eyes flashing with defiance.

A cruel smirk twisted Maxwell's lips. "If Blackwood truly gave a damn, don't you think he'd have assigned security the moment your name started trending? The Blackwood Group has endless resources - private security, investigators, whatever you need."

"Even if he doesn't care about me personally," Vivian countered, her voice steady despite the pounding of her heart, "the Blackwood family's reputation and their stock prices are at stake. They'll intervene."

Maxwell's words cut deep, but Vivian refused to let it show.

The financial implications alone would force their hand. That's what she told herself.

Maxwell's laughter was soft, chilling.

He turned to his hired men, producing two thick stacks of bills from his coat. "Job well done. Take the speedboat to Ashford and arrange transport from there."

The men's faces lit up with greedy relief as they pocketed the cash.

When they'd disappeared, Maxwell turned back to Vivian with a predator's smile.

"Do you believe in fate, darling?" he purred. "Because mine's been spectacular. First, you had that unfortunate incident in Emberglow County. Now Sebastian's rabid fans have made you public enemy number one online." He leaned closer. "Even if Adrian finds you, how could he possibly connect this to me?"

Ice flooded Vivian's veins.

The unspoken threat hung between them like a guillotine's blade.

Dead women don't testify.

Her pulse roared in her ears as realization struck - Maxwell never planned to let her leave this yacht alive.

Meanwhile, tension crackled through Sebastian's penthouse. Most of the production crew had gathered, transforming the spacious lounge into a cramped war room. With Damien unavailable at a fashion show in Azurevale, they felt leaderless.

Sebastian ended his call with Lydia, his face grim. "She says Vivian never made it home. She's checking security footage now." He grabbed his jacket. "We need to call the police."

Harrison blocked his path. "Vivian's a grown woman who's been missing less than sixty minutes. The police aren't your personal concierge service." His practical tone cut through the panic. "If paparazzi catch wind of this, imagine the headlines."

Isabella nodded in agreement. "If this is a kidnapping, alerting authorities too soon could endanger her further."
###Chapter 207

Sebastian's frustration was a living thing, coiling around him like smoke. He paced the length of the penthouse, fingers raking through his hair.

Harrison's voice cut through the tension. "You're a global icon, Sebastian. Every decision you make is scrutinized. Think before you act."

Sebastian collapsed onto the leather couch, his jaw tight. "What's the point of all this fame if I can't even protect the people who matter?"

Isabella stepped forward, her voice gentle but urgent. "Regrets won't help now. If only we had connections in Crestwood—someone with power in both legal and underground circles."

Harrison stroked his chin. "If Damien Vaughn were here, his family's influence could resolve this in hours."

Someone murmured, "Lydia's family has money. Maybe they can intervene."

Harrison shook his head. "The Bennetts are new money. Their strength is in capital, not leverage. If Vivian's been taken, cash alone won't bring her back."

Sebastian slammed his fist into the couch cushion. For the first time, he hated his own pride—his refusal to court the elite. He'd built his career on talent, not favors.

Isabella's mind raced. Then, like lightning, it struck her—a name, a solution.

"I know someone," she blurted.

Harrison arched a brow. "Who?" His skepticism was palpable. Isabella wasn't exactly the type to rub shoulders with the powerful.

She hesitated. "It's... one of Vivian's friends."

Sebastian's eyes flashed with recognition. "Her best friend? Audrey Winslow? The Winslow heiress?"

"The Winslows?" Harrison's expression shifted. "You mean the family behind Winslow Global?"

Sebastian nodded. "Adrian Blackwood's fiancée—well, ex-fiancée. I saw her photo on his desk once. She's been studying in Janfort."

Harrison exhaled. "If it's the Winslows, we might have a chance. Go, Isabella. Now."

Isabella swallowed hard, then turned and bolted from the room.

Blackwood Group Headquarters

The taxi pulled away, leaving Isabella standing before the monolithic Blackwood Tower. Glass and steel stretched into the sky, a monument to power.

Her stomach twisted. What if Adrian refuses? What if he thinks I'm lying?

She'd never spoken to a man like him—a titan of industry, a force of nature. Now she was about to storm his fortress, begging for help.

Doubt clawed at her. But then she remembered Vivian's laughter, Sebastian's desperation.

Steeling herself, she pushed through the revolving doors.
###Chapter 208

The polished marble floors reflected Isabella's nervous silhouette as she stepped into the grand lobby. Her fingers tightened around the strap of her thrift store bag. "Excuse me, I need to see Mr. Adrian Blackwood."

The receptionist's perfectly manicured nails paused over her keyboard. Her gaze traveled from Isabella's worn sneakers to the faded band tee peeking beneath her denim jacket. "Do you have a scheduled appointment?"

"Appointment?" Isabella's voice cracked. "No, but this is urgent. His friend Vivian is in serious trouble."

A practiced smile stretched across the receptionist's lips. "Miss, perhaps you should contact the authorities. Or if your friend knows Mr. Blackwood personally, their family might—"

"Family?" Isabella bit her lip. Vivian's estranged relatives wouldn't lift a finger to help.

"Darling, who is this... charming visitor?" A melodic voice cut through the tension.

Isabella turned to face a vision in couture - Serena Whitmore adjusting her diamond-encrusted sunglasses. The receptionist practically tripped over herself. "Ms. Whitmore! The CEO is expecting you. The private elevator is ready."

Serena's sharp eyes narrowed as recognition dawned. "Wait... you're that makeup girl from Vivian's set." Her designer heels clicked against the floor as she circled Isabella like a shark. "What's this nonsense about Vivian being in danger?"

The receptionist interjected, "She claims Mr. Blackwood's friend needs help, Ms. Whitmore."

Serena's manicured fingers tapped against her Birkin bag. The trending scandal flashed through her mind - perhaps those rabid Sebastian Hartwell fans had already acted. Or better yet, Miranda Graves had finally made her move. Either scenario would permanently remove Vivian from the spotlight.

With a theatrical sigh, Serena waved a dismissive hand. "Look at her. Does she look like someone who'd move in Adrian's circles? Honestly, if you keep letting randoms wander in, they'll start expecting him to solve world hunger next."

The receptionist's cheeks burned. "Of course, Ms. Whitmore. I'll handle this immediately."

The elevator pinged. Audrey Winslow stormed out, dragging a teary-eyed intern behind her. "I told you this place was toxic! Their internship requirements might as well ask for a Nobel Prize!" Her tirade halted as she took in the scene. "Well, well. The mistress playing CEO? How... predictable."

Audrey's stilettoes struck the marble like gunshots as she positioned herself between Isabella and Serena. "Problem here, ladies?"
###Chapter 209

Audrey Winslow's expression turned icy. "Last I checked, Adrian has a wife, a mother, and a grandmother. Since when do you give orders around here?"

Serena Whitmore stiffened at Audrey's sharp tone. Worried Audrey might reveal Vivian's true identity, Serena turned to the receptionist. "What are you waiting for? Call security and remove her immediately!"

"Right away, ma'am." The receptionist quickly signaled for security.

Serena adjusted her sunglasses with a triumphant smirk. "Let's not have a repeat of this unpleasantness," she said, swaying dramatically toward the elevator.

Security arrived within moments, but the receptionist hesitated upon noticing Audrey's expensive attire and confident demeanor. She chose her words carefully.

"Miss, please don't make this difficult for us," she said politely to Audrey. "Jobs are hard to come by these days."

Then turning to Isabella Thornton, she added, "If your friend is truly in danger, you should contact the authorities immediately."

"My apologies for the trouble," Isabella said dejectedly before turning to Audrey. "Thank you for standing up for me."

Audrey studied Isabella's face, recognition dawning. "Wait—you're Vivian's makeup artist! What are you doing here?"

Isabella's eyes lit up with hope as she recognized Audrey. "Ms. Winslow?" Finally, someone who could help! She didn't know Audrey's full name but remembered Sebastian mentioning her connection to the powerful Winslow family.

Clutching at this lifeline, Isabella pleaded, "Ms. Winslow, you have to help! It's Vivian."

Her gaze darted nervously between the security guards and receptionist before whispering urgently, "Can we talk outside?"

Audrey followed without hesitation, her brow furrowing with concern.

Once outside, Isabella blurted, "Vivian's been kidnapped!"

Audrey's eyes widened. "What?"

The younger woman who had accompanied Audrey spoke up. "I'll take my leave now." She gave Isabella a reassuring nod. "Don't worry—my lips are sealed."

After seeing her companion off, Audrey gestured toward her luxury sedan. "Get in. Tell me everything on the way."

Isabella poured out the entire story, her voice shaking with urgency. Audrey listened intently, her expression growing graver with each revelation.

At Blackwood Group Headquarters

In the CEO's office, a group of wealthy businessmen lounged on Italian leather sofas, debating their evening plans.

"How about Mirage Lounge tonight?" one suggested with a smirk.

Another chuckled darkly. "You've got nerve going back there after what happened! Taking that girl's virginity and then acting like nothing happened? Cold. Didn't she come looking for you yesterday?"
###Chapter 210

The crude jokes about "taking a girl's innocence" and "playing hard to get" echoed through the office.

Though the conversation wasn't directed at him, Adrian Blackwood's jaw tightened visibly. His fingers stilled over the documents he'd been reviewing.

A storm brewed behind Adrian's composed facade as he reached for his cigarette case. The platinum lighter - engraved with his family crest - flashed under the office lights. "Celebrating already?" His voice cut through the laughter like ice. "One contract signed and you think the work is done?"

The room fell deathly silent.

One executive swallowed hard. "Mr. Blackwood, we merely thought—"

"Thought wrong." Adrian snapped the lighter shut with a decisive click. "I want preliminary market analysis on my desk by dawn. Ethan will be waiting." He paused, letting the unspoken threat hang in the air. "Fail to deliver, and consider your positions vacant."

The men scrambled like frightened rabbits, briefcases snapping shut in their haste to escape.

Adrian's polished oxfords connected with the coffee table, sending crystal ashtrays crashing to the floor. The sound of shattering glass chased his retreating employees out the door.

Meanwhile, aboard the luxury yacht, Vivian Hartley watched the shoreline shrink to a thin ribbon on the horizon. The men transferring her to the larger vessel moved with practiced efficiency, their laughter carrying over the waves.

The ocean stretched endlessly, its vastness broken only by the occasional cry of gulls.

Maxwell Sterling moved closer, his expensive cologne overwhelming. "You always did smell divine," he murmured, lips brushing Vivian's ear.

She jerked away violently.

Bound as she was, the movement sent her sprawling across the teak deck. The impact knocked the breath from her lungs.

Maxwell crouched beside her, fingers digging into her jaw with bruising force. "Still refusing to accept reality, Vivian?" His breath was hot against her face. "Every soul on this ship answers to me. Where exactly do you think—"

The pain focused her mind strangely. If escape was impossible... then she would meet her fate on her own terms.

The realization brought an odd calm.

"I... understand now," she forced through clenched teeth.

Maxwell recoiled slightly. "Understand what?"

Vivian lifted her chin, meeting his gaze squarely. "All this theater," she said coolly, "just to get me into bed? You always did go to absurd lengths for sex."

The truth hung between them, stark and undeniable.

The yacht cut through the waves, carrying them further from shore.

Further from help.

Further from any hope of rescue.
###Chapter 211

Maxwell's expression darkened instead of brightening. His piercing gaze locked onto Vivian as a sardonic smirk played on his lips. "Don't even consider it. Even if you miraculously slip away from this yacht, remember—we're in the middle of the ocean."

"The nearest land is hundreds of nautical miles away. You'd never survive."

Vivian released a soft, mocking chuckle. "How curious that I'm not the frightened one here, but you appear to be, Mr. Sterling."

She lifted her chin defiantly, her emerald eyes flashing with a dangerous blend of sarcasm and seduction.

To her surprise, Maxwell didn't erupt in anger. Instead, a deep laugh rumbled from his chest. "How could I possibly believe you, Vivian? Years ago, I offered your family prestige, influence, and unimaginable wealth, yet you rejected my proposal. Recently, I saved your life, yet you refused even a simple dinner. Now suddenly you're compliant? Do you think me a fool?"

With deliberate calmness, Vivian met his gaze and shrugged slightly. "My hesitation to marry you or keep my distance was never about you."

She took a measured breath before continuing with fiery intensity. "I refused to be my family's bargaining chip. My fractured relationship with them is no secret. I despise my father for his infidelity that killed my mother. I loathe my stepmother and stepsister for stealing what was rightfully mine. They cast me out, and my grandmother raised me alone. These aren't state secrets—anyone with minimal curiosity could uncover the truth."

Maxwell visibly recoiled. He'd always admired Vivian's fierce independence, never realizing how profoundly he'd misread the situation.

If only he'd been more persistent in pursuing Vivian directly—perhaps this extraordinary woman wouldn't have endured such tragic circumstances.

Each miscalculation only deepened his regret.

A flicker of remorse shadowed Maxwell's eyes—a detail Vivian didn't miss.

Seizing the moment, she made her request. "Would you untie me now, please?"

Before Maxwell could respond, a brilliant lightning bolt split the sky, heralding the storm's violent arrival. The tranquil sea transformed into a churning maelstrom under the tempest's fury.

As twilight descended, ominous clouds rolled in, unleashing torrential rains that pounded the yacht's deck.

Meanwhile, in the car, Audrey processed Isabella's revelations while desperately calling marketing firms about the accounts—all claiming the information came through anonymous Twitter DMs, not their databases.

The complexity of Vivian's predicament now exceeded Audrey's ability to handle alone, forcing her to consider involving her powerful family.

With a resigned sigh, she lit a cigarette from a long-neglected pack.

Isabella leaned forward urgently. "Miss Audrey, you must intervene for Vivian. She faced danger before in Emberglow County—though I don't know details, seeing her in the hospital was terrifying. She was so weak she couldn't even dress herself!"

The full truth about Vivian's Emberglow County ordeal had been kept from Audrey. Vivian had concealed the details to protect her.
###Chapter 212

The rain lashed against the windshield as Audrey narrowed her eyes, processing Isabella's words. "If what you're suggesting is true, this goes beyond some obsessed fan - this could be payback from enemies Vivian made in Emberglow County!"

With renewed determination, Audrey stubbed out her cigarette in the ashtray. Family ties would have to be mended, no matter how painful. Saving Vivian was all that mattered now.

Her fingers had just curled around the gearshift when movement caught her eye through the rain-streaked window. A familiar figure emerged from the downpour.

Dominic had barely walked two blocks when the skies opened up. Cursing his luck, he made a dash for the nearest Blackwood Group building's awning.

"Dominic!" The shout cut through the pounding rain. He spun around, searching for the source. The voice came again, more insistent this time.

Following the sound, his gaze landed on a navy sedan with its window rolled down. Audrey waved frantically from the driver's seat.

Without thinking, he sprinted toward the car, noting the front passenger seat was already occupied. He yanked open the back door and slid inside, dripping onto the leather seats.

Audrey - the woman his cousin never stopped praising for helping her settle abroad. They'd met at that awkward thank-you dinner his cousin insisted on throwing, where he'd been roped into footing the bill. That night had sparked an easy friendship, complete with exchanged contacts.

"Here." Audrey tossed him a plush towel from the glove compartment. The fabric carried her distinctive jasmine perfume as he rubbed it over his soaked hair.

With his trademark smirk, he asked, "Fancy meeting you here. Since my car's in the shop, mind playing chauffeur?" His tone turned serious when he noticed her expression. "What's wrong?"

"No time for jokes! My friend's in serious trouble - we're heading to the precinct now!" Audrey's usual playful demeanor had vanished, replaced by urgent intensity as she explained the situation.

She laid out the terrifying details about Vivian's disappearance with military precision.

Though Isabella didn't know Dominic, the panic in Audrey's voice had her chiming in: "Every second counts! Vivian could be in real danger!"

Vivian... Working with Sebastian on a film...

The pieces clicked together with terrifying clarity. It couldn't be a coincidence.

"What?" Dominic went rigid, his hands freezing mid-motion. His eyes widened as he turned slowly to Audrey, clinging to one last shred of hope. "Did you say Vivian?"

"Yes, Vivian Hartley!" Audrey gestured wildly toward the Blackwood Group skyscraper visible through the rain. "Wife of that ice-cold Adrian Blackwood from the infamous Blackwood family. Don't your families run in the same circles? How could you not know he got married?"

Isabella's jaw dropped even further than Dominic's. "Wait - Adrian Blackwood is married to Vivian?" Her voice cracked with disbelief.
###Chapter 213

"You had no idea?" Audrey's perfectly arched eyebrows shot up as she studied Isabella with growing bewilderment. "Then what made you go searching for him at Blackwood Group?"

Isabella's fingers twisted nervously around her purse strap. "When Vivian got into trouble back in Emberglow County, Mr. Blackwood appeared at the hospital too. I just assumed they were..."

She hesitated, biting her lower lip. "Casual acquaintances."

Dominic didn't have time to marvel at the tangled web of connections. His voice turned urgent. "This is critical. We need to locate Adrian immediately!"

Audrey let out a derisive snort, tossing her caramel highlights over one shoulder. "Isabella just tried contacting him and got booted out because of his precious 'true love'! He's clearly waiting for Vivian to disappear so that snake Serena can take her place!"

Dominic shook his head vehemently. "That doesn't make sense! If Adrian really wanted that, he would've signed those divorce papers without hesitation. Why prolong things?"

"Oh please," Audrey rolled her emerald green eyes dramatically. "Then explain why Isabella got thrown out of Blackwood Group headquarters?"

"There must be some misunderstanding," Dominic insisted, already pulling out his phone with trembling fingers. "Adrian, it's about Vivian—"

The icy voice that answered could've frozen lava. "Since when do you involve yourself in her business?"

Before Dominic could stutter a response, Serena's saccharine voice floated through the line. "Dominic was just sharing some juicy industry gossip."

Seizing the lifeline, Dominic nodded vigorously. "Exactly! It's about Vivian, she's—"

Adrian's voice turned lethal. "If she's so resourceful, why involve me? Don't bring her problems to me again." The line went dead with finality.

Every word echoed through the car's premium sound system, leaving no room for misinterpretation.

Audrey crossed her arms, her manicured nails tapping impatiently against her leather seat. "Well? Are you helping or should I drop you at the nearest curb?"

"Of course I'm helping!" Dominic ran a frustrated hand through his tousled brown hair, still reeling from Adrian's callous dismissal.

He straightened suddenly, determination hardening his features. "We're going to the police station. Now."

At the precinct, they recounted Vivian's disappearance to a weary-looking officer.

The cop glanced at his watch before scribbling halfheartedly. "It's barely been six hours. Without concrete evidence of foul play, she probably just turned her phone off. Go home, wait for contact, and if you get a ransom demand, we'll take it from there."

The outcome was precisely what Harrison had predicted.
###Chapter 214

The polished office door swung open as a distinguished-looking man in his fifties stepped out, his sharp eyes immediately landing on Dominic. "Mr. Sinclair, this is an unexpected visit. What brings you to our precinct today?"

Dominic's tense expression softened slightly at the familiar face. He moved forward with purposeful strides, his voice laced with urgency. "We require your assistance immediately. It's about Vivian Hartley - Adrian Blackwood's wife. She's disappeared. If anything were to happen to the Blackwood family's young mistress..."

"Mrs. Blackwood is missing? And where is Mr. Blackwood himself?" The officer's demeanor shifted instantly, his professional mask slipping into genuine concern.

Dominic's fingers twitched near his temple before he smoothly fabricated, "Adrian is currently handling a critical business emergency overseas. He's entrusted me with this matter."

The officer's brow furrowed. "This is highly irregular. Protocol requires either the Blackwood family or Mrs. Hartley's relatives to file the official missing persons report."

"Understood. I'll contact them right away," Dominic replied, already pulling out his phone to call the Blackwood estate as he turned on his heel, the gravity of the situation pressing upon him.

Meanwhile, Margaret Blackwood and her niece Bianca were preparing to leave the mansion when the head housekeeper intercepted them, holding out the cordless phone with both hands. "Mrs. Blackwood, Mr. Sinclair is on the line for you."

Margaret paused, her perfectly arched eyebrows drawing together. "Dominic? Why would he be calling here?"

The housekeeper merely shook her head. "He was quite insistent about speaking with you directly, madam."

"With me?" Margaret's confusion deepened, her manicured fingers hovering uncertainly near the receiver.

Bianca, ever the perceptive young woman, gently squeezed her aunt's arm. "Aunt Margaret, it must be important. Perhaps you should hear what he has to say?"

With visible reluctance, Margaret accepted the phone. "Dominic, what's this about?"

The line crackled with Dominic's urgent tone. "Margaret, it's Vivian. She's gone missing. There's been some tabloid scandal involving her co-star from 'Whispering Skies,' and now she's disappeared. We suspect an obsessed fan may have taken her-"

Margaret's voice turned icy before he could finish. "What? Another scandal? And now she's been kidnapped? That girl brings nothing but disgrace to the Blackwood name! Poor Adrian must be humiliated!"

Dominic quickly corrected, "No, Margaret, you misunderstand. The rumors are completely unfounded. Our primary concern is her safety - we believe she may have been abducted by an unstable admirer."

Margaret's patience wore thinner with each word. "First a public scandal, now this? Where is my son during all this... this circus?"

"Adrian is handling urgent business abroad and asked me to manage the situation," Dominic repeated his carefully constructed lie. "But the authorities require a family member to file the official report, so-"

Margaret exhaled sharply through her nose, her lips pressing into a thin line. "I-"

She was just about to declare she would handle the distasteful matter herself when-
###Chapter 215

Vivian pressed her palm tightly against the phone's receiver. "Aunt Margaret, can't you see? This is our golden opportunity."

"What opportunity?" Margaret's eyebrows knitted together in confusion.

Leaning in closer, Vivian's voice became a conspiratorial whisper. "This is the perfect moment to make Vivian vanish completely."

She had noticed how even Dominic seemed overly concerned about Vivian's disappearance, which only stoked the flames of her jealousy. "If Adrian finds out—" Margaret's voice faltered, hesitation coloring her words.

Vivian waved her hand dismissively. "It has nothing to do with us. Dominic has no concrete proof of her kidnapping. If things escalate, we'll simply claim ignorance about the seriousness of the situation. Besides, if family intervention is needed, her father is still alive. Surely he's more qualified than you?"

Margaret hesitated, wrestling with her conscience before finally giving a reluctant nod.

Vivian removed her hand from the phone. "Dominic, if this is truly a family matter, her father should be involved. It's not my place to interfere. You should contact the Dawson family instead."

Margaret's gaze drifted to the rain-lashed window, her fingers tightening around the phone until her knuckles turned white.

Meanwhile, the ocean raged with unrestrained fury, violent winds howling across the churning waters.

On the medium-sized yacht, Maxwell lost his footing and crashed onto the deck.

A crew member burst into the cabin, his face etched with urgency. "Mr. Sterling, we must turn back immediately."

Despite all their careful planning, nature seemed determined to mock their efforts.

Maxwell, irritation flashing across his face, adjusted his collar and demanded, "What if we continue forward?"

The crew member shook his head firmly. "Impossible. Beyond this point lies international waters. Without proper documentation, we'd be facing far greater consequences."

Still sprawled on the floor, Maxwell's gaze shifted to the bound woman before him. The ropes dug cruelly into her delicate skin, accentuating her curves. She met his stare with icy defiance, her cracked lips and bruised cheeks adding a haunting vulnerability to her beauty.

A possessive hunger surged through him - this treasure would not escape his grasp. "Change course for the harbor," he ordered, struggling to his feet unsteadily.

After a moment's pause, he added, "Take her to the master cabin." Leaning heavily against the wall as he exited, two burly men immediately seized Vivian, dragging her toward another room.

The cabin was sparsely furnished - just a narrow bed and a tiny adjoining bathroom. They threw her onto the mattress and quickly departed.

Maxwell sat on the edge of the bed, fingers trembling with anticipation as he began removing his clothes. When he reached for her dress, Vivian swallowed her revulsion and forced a saccharine smile. "Untie me, and I'll do it myself," she murmured softly.

Maxwell paused, studying her face before breaking into a knowing smirk. "Darling, this is my one shot. I can't risk anything going wrong." His hands continued their invasion, pulling aside her dress and creeping toward her undergarments.
###Chapter 216

A deafening crack of thunder split the air as a monstrous wave slammed against the yacht's hull. The violent impact sent Vivian and Maxwell tumbling across the bed. Simultaneously, the storm wrenched the adjacent window open, unleashing a torrent of wind and rain into the cabin.

Vivian's eyes lit up with sudden hope at the sight of the gaping window. She immediately began inching her bound body toward the potential escape route.

Maxwell staggered as dizziness overwhelmed him. When his vision cleared, he saw Vivian already halfway out the window, poised to jump into the raging sea.

"Vivian!" Maxwell bellowed, his voice raw with panic as he lunged forward to stop her.

With one decisive motion, Vivian threw herself through the window frame. Maxwell's desperate grab only caught empty air as his fingertips grazed her ankle a second too late.

The yacht pitched violently, thwarting his attempt to regain balance or pull her back. Helpless, he could only watch in horror as Vivian's silhouette disappeared into the stormy darkness.

"Where the fuck is everyone?" Maxwell roared, smashing the emergency button repeatedly. "Get in here now, goddamn it!"

Within seconds, a team of security personnel burst into the room, struggling to maintain footing as the yacht rocked dangerously. Seawater and rain poured through the shattered window, soaking everything in sight.

"Mr. Sterling, it's too dangerous here," one guard shouted over the storm. "We've prepared a secure location—"

Maxwell backhanded two guards mid-sentence. "Secure location? Are you out of your minds? She just jumped! Find her! Do you have any idea what I sacrificed to get her here?"

Despite their stinging cheeks, the guards remained professional. "Sir, we're near the propellers. Even if she survived the fall, the currents would have—"

Another guard added, "The storm's intensifying. Search efforts are impossible right now. Our priority must be your safety."

A third chimed in, "Mr. Sterling, it's just one woman. The shareholders will have our heads if anything happens to you."

Maxwell clutched Vivian's abandoned shoe so tightly his knuckles turned white. He'd been so close. If only he'd dealt with those guards personally instead of dismissing them...

After a tense silence, Maxwell growled through clenched teeth, "Get my coat."

One quick-thinking guard snatched the shoe and hurled it out the window, eliminating the last physical trace of Vivian from the yacht.

The storm raged on as Maxwell was escorted to safety, his expression darker than the thunderclouds overhead.
###Chapter 217

The ocean swallowed Vivian whole, its merciless waves dragging her under like a discarded petal. The frigid water clawed at her skin, pulling her deeper into its abyss. She had braced herself for this moment, yet when death's shadow loomed, primal terror seized her.

Her will to survive ignited like a spark in the dark.

She had imagined this scenario a hundred times—but never truly wanted it to happen.

Gritting her teeth, Vivian fought against the ropes binding her wrists. Even the faintest chance was enough to keep her struggling.

She refused to give up.

Her second life had only just begun. Ambermyst was still unfinished. She couldn’t let it end here, in this watery grave.

There were scripts left unwritten. People who still believed in her, waiting for her return.

But her strength was slipping.

Her lungs burned, her muscles failing. The ocean was winning.

A gasp tore from her lips—saltwater flooded her throat, choking her.

Her body went slack, surrendering to the depths.

The light above dimmed, swallowed by endless black.

As consciousness faded, the ropes loosened—just slightly.

But it was too late.

Her last thought was of Eleanor. Regret twisted inside her—she wouldn’t be there for her grandmother anymore.

In the sterile glow of the hospital room, Serena lay on the examination table, wires snaking from her body to the humming machines beside her. The doctor studied the flickering data before meeting Adrian’s gaze.

"Ms. Whitmore’s recovery is remarkable," he said. "The new heart is functioning well—no major complications. Though, as expected with a transplant, there may be occasional discomfort. Nothing alarming."

Adrian gave a firm nod. "Continue the current treatment plan. It’s working."

Serena offered a fragile smile as she sat up, her voice soft but edged with something unreadable. "As long as it keeps beating, I can endure a little pain."

Ethan, standing silently nearby, frowned. There was something unsettling in her words—as if she saw herself as nothing more than a vessel for the heart, not its living recipient.

Wasn’t the point of this surgery to give her a better life?

The thought lingered, unsettling him.

Darkness swallowed Vivian whole.

The ocean had claimed her.

But fate wasn’t done yet.
###Chapter 218

Adrian moved across the room to Serena's side with deliberate gentleness. His fingers brushed through her silken hair before settling the cashmere coat around her shoulders. "Don't torture yourself with those thoughts," he murmured, his voice like warm honey. "I'll move heaven and earth to keep you safe and happy."

The tender moment shattered when Ethan's phone buzzed violently against the marble side table. He exchanged a loaded glance with Adrian before slipping into the shadowed hallway.

Alone in the dim passage, Ethan pressed the phone to his ear. "Mr. Sinclair." The name tasted bitter after Adrian's explosive argument with Dominic earlier. What fresh chaos had that man unleashed now?

Dominic's voice crackled through the line, ragged with panic. "It's bad—Vivian's disappeared! You need to get Adrian now. We can't waste another second!"

The words tumbled out in a breathless rush. "We've searched everywhere for hours. The damn police won't file a report until morning." A frustrated growl. "I even reached out to Margaret, but she pawned me off to the Dawsons. Those vultures wouldn't lift a finger to help."

A weighted pause. "Had to call in favors from old contacts." He omitted how the Sinclairs had coldly refused assistance, deeming Vivian unworthy of their resources. For the first time, Dominic saw his glittering social circle for what it truly was—a gilded cage of indifference.

"Five hours searching every place she might be. Her phone's dead, and now Adrian's not answering. You have to—"

"Mr. Sinclair," Ethan cut in sharply, already pivoting toward the sitting room.

He burst through the double doors, phone clutched like a lifeline. "Mr. Blackwood! Mrs. Hartley is missing!"

Adrian's head snapped up, dark brows knitting together. "What do you mean missing?" His irritation gave way to dawning alarm. Across from him, Serena's eyes glittered with barely concealed triumph. The fans had acted faster than she'd dared hope.

"Let me speak to him!" Dominic's voice crackled from the phone. Ethan passed it over, watching as the color drained from Adrian's face.

Serena blinked up innocently, her voice a delicate whisper. "I just checked the trending tags. It's all harmless chatter, really." She let her fingers trail along Adrian's sleeve. "And Vivian's always been terrible about answering her phone. Reporting her missing every time would be ridiculous, wouldn't it?"

Adrian remained frozen, his expression stormy. Serena tugged gently at his arm. "Adrian, we still have those tests... and the bloodwork. I'm terrified to go alone."

With deliberate care, Adrian disentangled himself. "Ethan, call Miranda. Both of you stay with Serena for her appointments." His jaw tightened as he strode toward the door, phone still pressed to his ear. "Dominic, start from the beginning."

The heavy oak door clicked shut behind him, leaving Serena standing alone, her manicured nails digging crescent moons into her palms. Across the room, Ethan already had his phone out, dialing with tense fingers.

Outside, the city lights blurred past the tinted windows of Adrian's waiting car, each bright point a possible clue in Vivian's disappearance. Somewhere in the glittering maze of Crestwood, time was running out.
###Chapter 219

Serena's face twisted in shock, her delicate features contorted with distress. "Adrian, I can't do this alone! Needles terrify me, and all these medical tests are unbearable," she pleaded, her voice cracking as tears welled up in her eyes.

"Be strong, Serena," Adrian murmured gently, already turning toward the door. His retreating figure left behind a suffocating silence. Serena watched him go, fists clenched so tightly her nails left crescent marks on her palms. In that moment, she wished Vivian would disappear from existence.

Vivian blinked awake. The crystal chandelier above swayed gently, its harsh light making her raise a trembling hand to shield her eyes. As her vision cleared, reality crashed over her—this wasn't a dream. Confusion swirled in her mind. Was she really alive? Had someone pulled her from the ocean? Had Maxwell been the one to save her?

She glanced down at herself—dressed in fresh athletic wear beneath a silk duvet. Strangely, she felt no pain, no lingering effects from her ordeal. Sitting up, she took in the expansive room, far grander than Maxwell's yacht cabin. The pristine white walls exuded the same luxury as the Blackwood family's private vessel.

The door creaked open. A man entered wearing a crisp white shirt that contrasted with his tanned skin. His refined features softened when their eyes met, the chandelier light catching in his gaze like he was looking at something precious.

"Vivian, it's been years," Julian said, his voice like warm honey, instantly soothing the storm of panic that had gripped her all night.

Something inside Vivian shattered. Hot tears spilled down her cheeks in an unstoppable flood. She didn't know if it was fear, relief, or heartbreak—only that she couldn't contain the emotions any longer.

Julian sat beside her, hesitating only a moment before resting a comforting hand on her shoulder. "You're safe now." Those three words broke her completely. Sobs wracked her body as she curled into herself, knees pulled tight against her chest. All the emotions she'd bottled up came pouring out in shuddering waves.

She'd always been fortunate—someone always appeared to rescue her in dire moments. But never Adrian. No matter how many times she told herself not to expect anything from him, his face always surfaced in her mind during crises. And every single time, he disappointed her. That fragile hope she'd nurtured deep inside finally extinguished, leaving only hollow darkness.

Julian remained silent beside her, his steady presence an anchor in her emotional storm. When her tears finally subsided, she wiped her face, embarrassed. "I'm sorry you had to see that."

He handed her a tissue with a gentle smile. "Don't apologize."

They'd met during her freshman year when he was a junior. She'd mistaken him for harassing a girl when he'd actually caught her stealing. Without hesitation, Vivian had thrown her stack of heavy textbooks at him, breaking his nose. Instead of anger, he'd patiently explained the situation. That bizarre encounter sparked an unlikely friendship.

They'd bonded over shared literary passions and intellectual debates. But their connection was cut short when Julian graduated early, earning a scholarship to Ravenshore. Life intervened—family pressures and personal struggles caused Vivian to lose touch over the years.
###Chapter 220

The storm outside rattled the windows as Vivian Hartley sat up in bed, her fingers clutching the silk sheets. She hadn't expected to wake up in such luxurious surroundings after nearly drowning.

Julian Montclair didn't ask what had brought her to this desperate state. Instead, he casually leaned against the mahogany dresser. "Funny coincidence. I was supposed to be on a private cruise with some associates, but the storm forced us to dock at Crestwood."

Vivian's eyebrows lifted slightly. She knew these exclusive yacht trips often masked high-stakes gambling rings operating in international waters. The Julian she remembered from university had been a scholarship student wearing thrift store blazers.

Her stomach chose that moment to growl loudly. Heat rushed to her cheeks.

Julian's lips quirked. "It's well past dinner, but I could make you some carbonara." His tone was light, as if they were back in their college days sharing instant noodles.

"Thank you," she whispered, suddenly aware of how dry her throat felt.

"Still so formal," he chuckled, pausing at the cabin door. "Oh, and one of the female crew members changed you into dry clothes." His considerate explanation made her shoulders relax.

When he left, Vivian moved to the panoramic window. The yacht barely rocked despite the raging sea outside, its stabilizers working perfectly. Only the slight sway of the crystal chandelier betrayed the storm's fury.

Her momentary safety felt fragile. Once they reached port, Maxwell Sterling's reach would extend far beyond Crestwood. The tabloid scandal that had started this nightmare replayed in her mind - too perfectly timed to be coincidence.

The cabin door opened again, bringing the rich aroma of garlic and pancetta. Julian carried a steaming plate, his expression expectant. The sight unexpectedly transported her to another time, when Adrian Blackwood had cooked for her during a power outage.

"Try it," Julian urged, offering a forkful.

She pushed the memory away and took a bite. The flavors exploded on her tongue, reminding her how long it had been since she'd eaten properly. Within minutes, she'd cleaned the plate.

"Better?" Julian watched her with amused eyes.

Vivian nodded, though her stomach could have handled more. "I'm completely full," she insisted when his gaze remained skeptical.

Julian set the plate aside with an indulgent smile. "Remember that café near campus? The one with the terrible jazz music but amazing tiramisu?"

A genuine laugh escaped her lips for the first time in days.
###Chapter 221

The golden afternoon light filtered through the yacht's windows as Vivian and Julian lost themselves in memories of their university days.

Exhaustion soon claimed her, and she drifted into sleep under the comforting weight of his presence.

Julian carefully draped a cashmere throw over her, his fingers lingering on the soft fabric. He studied her peaceful expression before pressing a whisper-soft kiss to her temple. "Vivian," he murmured, "I've returned."

Dark dreams plagued Vivian's sleep. She thrashed beneath the covers, reliving the terror of drowning in icy waters. Through the murky depths, she saw Adrian standing on shore, his expression cold as marble. Beside him, Serena smirked in triumph, watching Vivian struggle for breath.

A sharp knocking shattered the nightmare. "Vivian? Are you awake?" Julian's concerned voice carried through the door.

She jolted upright, heart pounding. Rubbing her temples, she glanced at the window where the storm had given way to a breathtaking sunset painting the ocean in fiery hues. For a disorienting moment, she couldn't distinguish dream from reality.

"I'm up," she called, surprised at how steady her voice sounded.

Julian's tone softened. "We've docked. Take your time getting ready."

"Thanks." She threw off the covers with determination. The previous night's storm had knocked out all communications, leaving her unable to contact Sebastian or Lydia. She could only imagine their worry.

Emerging onto the deck, Vivian found the yacht eerily quiet. Only Julian and a few staff remained as everyone else had disembarked. Leaning against the railing, she scanned the bustling dock below.

Her breath caught.

There, standing out like a raven among doves, was Adrian. Police officers surrounded him, yet his commanding presence dominated the space. He'd come for her - whether by duty or summons, it didn't matter. Where had he been when she'd been fighting for her life?

Her gaze shifted, finding Lydia and Audrey at the crowd's edge. Surprisingly, Dominic stood with them rather than beside Adrian. Vivian dismissed the thought as she followed Julian down the gangplank.

"Chilly today," Julian remarked, draping his tailored coat over her shoulders with protective care. "I triggered the emergency beacon immediately after finding you. That wasn't an accident, Vivian. Since everyone else had left, this gathering is undoubtedly for you."

Gratitude warmed her chest. Julian's quick thinking had saved her in more ways than one.

"Vivian!" Audrey's voice cut through the noise as she rushed forward, grasping Vivian's arms. Her sharp eyes scanned for injuries. Though the rope burns were hidden beneath clothes and the cut on her lip nearly healed thanks to Julian's care, Audrey's concern was palpable.

The sunset painted the scene in dramatic golds and purples as Vivian stepped onto solid ground, leaving the nightmare at sea behind. But the real storm, she knew, was just beginning.
###Chapter 222

Tears streamed down Audrey's face as she pulled Vivian into a crushing embrace. "I was petrified! Those deranged fans could've done anything to you!" she sobbed, her voice breaking with raw emotion.

Vivian melted into the hug, drawing comfort from her friend's warmth before turning to Lydia. "Lydia, I'm so sorry for scaring you like this."

The yacht had been a dead zone for signals. "All that matters is you're safe now," Lydia replied with a gentle smile, her professional calm never wavering. She reached for her phone. "I need to call Sebastian immediately. The poor man hasn't slept a wink worrying about you."

As Lydia stepped aside to make the call, Adrian observed the reunion with silent intensity. His stormy gaze never left Vivian, though she pointedly avoided looking his way. The deliberate snub stung more than he cared to admit - especially when he'd been the first person she should've sought out.

Even the seasoned officers on scene could feel the electric tension crackling in the air. Adrian studied Vivian closely - her designer outfit remained impeccable, her posture regal. Only the faint shadows under her eyes hinted at any distress. She looked nothing like the traumatized victim he'd imagined finding after his sleepless night of frantic searching.

After the fire incident and violent attacks, Adrian had sworn to himself he'd never let Vivian face danger alone again. At the first sign of trouble, he'd mobilized every resource - calling in favors, coordinating with multiple police departments. To an outsider, it might have looked like they were hunting a serial killer.

When the homicide tip came at dawn, he'd raced to the waterfront, standing vigil for hours. And now here she was - unharmed, composed, and standing beside another man.

Adrian's sharp eyes immediately caught the faint bruise at the corner of Vivian's mouth. His chest tightened momentarily with concern, but the emotion evaporated when his gaze landed on Julian.

Dressed in casual elegance, Julian looked like he'd stepped out of a magazine spread, the morning sunlight gilding his perfect features. When their eyes met, Julian offered a polite smile that didn't reach his frosty gaze.

The two men locked in a silent battle of wills - two alpha predators circling their territory. Though Julian lacked Adrian's battle-hardened edge, his quiet confidence radiated unshakable resolve.

"People are staring," Vivian murmured, gently patting Audrey's back. Completely oblivious to the war raging behind her, she helped Audrey compose herself.

Adrian moved with predatory grace, snatching the coat from Ethan's arm. In three strides, he was at Vivian's side. Without ceremony, he stripped Julian's jacket from her shoulders and tossed it back before draping his own over her.

His voice cut through the morning air like shards of ice. "Vivian, you're not a child. Start acting like it. A little online gossip and you disappear? Do you have any idea the resources I wasted searching for you all night?"

A thousand words burned in Adrian's throat - concern, relief, fear - but seeing Julian standing there twisted everything into cold accusation.
###Chapter 223

"Adrian, are you even listening to yourself? What's gotten into you?" Audrey snapped, rolling up her sleeves with fire in her eyes.

Dominic quickly intercepted, placing a restraining hand on her arm. "Easy, Audrey. Adrian's just worried sick. Would he have spent all night searching if he didn't care? Give him a break."

Though still visibly fuming, Audrey remembered Adrian's frantic state the previous evening. With a reluctant huff, she allowed Dominic to steer her away, muttering curses under her breath.

Vivian stood frozen, her mind reeling. Adrian actually thought she'd run away because of some online rumors? How little did he think of her strength?

Her voice shook with barely contained emotion. "Adrian, do you have any idea what I endured last night?" The unspoken accusations burned in her chest, but his lack of trust cut deeper than any physical wound.

Before Adrian could respond, Julian stepped forward, positioning himself as a protective shield between them.

"I don't know the full details," Julian began, his tone measured yet firm, "but when I found Vivian last night, she was unconscious in open water. If not for my crew's quick action, she wouldn't be standing here now."

He turned to the nearby officers with grave authority. "This appears to be an attempted homicide. I insist on a thorough investigation."

Vivian felt warmth spread through her chest at Julian's words. His steady presence anchored her, the stark contrast between the two men undeniable - one dismissive, the other fiercely protective.

Adrian's gaze darkened as it locked onto Julian, a storm brewing beneath his composed exterior.

For the first time, he believed he recognized a true manipulator - the kind who cloaked themselves in false innocence that women so often fell for.

"I'll take you to give your statement," Adrian stated coldly, reaching for Vivian's hand.

She recoiled from his touch.

With deliberate movements, she shrugged off his jacket and held it out. "Julian, as a witness, would you accompany me to the station?"

Adrian stood motionless, refusing to take the garment. The expensive designer jacket fell to the muddy ground, its pristine fabric instantly soiled, but his eyes never left Vivian's face, his chest constricting painfully.

"Of course I'll go with you," Julian replied softly, his tone carrying an undercurrent of challenge that Adrian found infuriating.

As they moved to leave, Adrian blocked their path, his voice glacial. "I said I'm taking you."

Vivian attempted to step around him. He shifted to block her again, his voice sharpening. "Vivian!"

"Enough. She's been through enough trauma," Julian interjected, his frown deepening despite his controlled tone.
###Chapter 224

Adrian Blackwood's piercing gaze locked onto Julian Montclair, his eyes flashing with dangerous intensity. "Julian, is that any way to speak to your elders?"

The tension in the air thickened as everyone assumed Adrian was mocking Julian by implying their similar ages made them practically equals.

Vivian Hartley believed it too.

Her emerald eyes darkened with barely concealed contempt as she deliberately stepped on Adrian's polished leather shoe. "Move."

The simple ballet flat made the gesture deceptively casual yet dripping with defiance, a silent challenge that echoed through the dock.

Julian, meanwhile, discreetly lowered his lashes to hide the spark of amusement dancing in his hazel eyes.

The message was clear - she was defending him.

Dominic Sinclair sucked in a sharp breath.

Defying Adrian Blackwood was a line few dared cross, yet Vivian did it without hesitation - for another man.

"Vivian!" Adrian's voice cracked like a whip through the tense silence.

Unfazed, she simply tugged at Julian's sleeve, guiding him toward the waiting police vehicle with deliberate steps.

Julian paused just long enough to give Adrian a perfectly polite nod before holding the car door open for Vivian.

They disappeared into the backseat together.

The officers, who had witnessed this brazen display of insubordination, wished they could melt into the wooden planks beneath their feet.

One senior officer finally gathered his courage. "Mr. Blackwood, we'll be returning to file the report now."

Adrian's stormy gaze remained fixed on the car containing Vivian, his expression unreadable.

"We'll keep you informed of any developments," the officer added hastily.

Taking Adrian's silence as acquiescence, the officer signaled sharply. "All units, return to station!"

"Lydia, let's follow them," Audrey Winslow suggested, guiding Lydia Bennett toward her parked Mercedes.

Dominic glanced between Audrey and Adrian, hesitating before biting out, "I'll come too," his eyes lingering on the departing vehicles with something akin to longing.

Soon, only Adrian and Dominic remained on the deserted dock.

Breaking the heavy silence, Dominic ventured carefully, "Adrian—"

A single glacial look from Adrian silenced him immediately.

At Cascade Residences...

After giving their statements, Audrey and Lydia accompanied Vivian to the hospital for a checkup. Fortunately, she only had minor scrapes that needed basic first aid.

Back in their apartment, Vivian kicked off her shoes and collapsed onto the plush sofa.

Audrey flopped down beside her, poking her friend's shoulder in mock annoyance. "Some best friend you are! You didn't tell me a single thing about what happened in Emberglow County!"

###Chapter 225

Lydia emerged from the kitchen balancing a steaming porcelain mug, its rich aroma filling the air as she handed it to Vivian before collapsing into the oversized beanbag opposite her.

Her hazel eyes locked onto Vivian's with unusual intensity. "Audrey's absolutely right. This burden isn't yours to carry alone."

"I know, I messed up," Vivian conceded, wrapping both hands around the warm ceramic. The heat traveled through her chilled fingers, bringing temporary comfort.

Audrey stood abruptly, her ballet flats padding across the hardwood as she retrieved the first aid kit from the bathroom cabinet.

She produced the special salve Beatrice had personally delivered for Vivian's injuries.

When Audrey saw the angry crimson marks crisscrossing Vivian's delicate skin, her vision blurred with unshed tears. "That monster Maxwell!" she spat, fingers trembling as she unscrewed the ointment lid. "He'll rot in hell for this."

Lydia tapped her manicured nails against her knee, exhaling a thin stream of smoke. "Perhaps I should speak with Damien about arranging some leave for you?"

"Absolutely not."

Vivian shook her head firmly. "We're already behind schedule after the location changes. The doctor cleared me - these bruises will fade with the medicated cream." She offered a weak smile. "Besides, the police have Maxwell's description now. I'll be fine."

Crossing her toned legs, Lydia took another drag, the cigarette's glow illuminating her pensive expression. "Given what we've uncovered, those Emberglow County thugs and the social media storm weren't Maxwell's doing. The attack was random, but the media circus? That was calculated."

Their gazes met in sudden understanding.

"Serena!" they exclaimed simultaneously.

Meanwhile, in a penthouse suite at the Harbor Grand, Maxwell Sterling paced like a caged animal, his insomnia-fueled frenzy evident in the destruction surrounding him - shattered glass, crushed cigarette butts, and half-empty liquor bottles.

Vivian's face haunted him. Two years of obsessive longing, now reduced to bitter ashes. She would become just another scar in his twisted collection.

As dawn's first light crept through the blackout curtains, his phone shrieked to life.

Maxwell glanced at the screen - Natasha.

Undoubtedly calling for updates on their failed scheme.

Natasha had masterminded the entire kidnapping plot with chilling precision, her mind sharper than any weapon.

His thumb hovered over the decline button when his head bodyguard cleared his throat meaningfully.

"Sir," the guard murmured, "considering she's Vivian's sister, wouldn't she make an excellent... alternative? And without those troublesome Blackwood connections."

Maxwell's eyes gleamed with sudden understanding, his lips curling into a predatory smile as he answered. "It's done. She's finished."

His voice dripped with false warmth. "As a token of my appreciation, I've acquired that limited-edition Valentino you coveted. Join me for dinner tonight - we'll celebrate properly."
###Chapter 226

"Perfect!" Natasha exclaimed, her voice dripping with satisfaction.

With Vivian no longer an obstacle, Adrian was finally within her reach—the ultimate prize she'd been coveting.

At Cascade Residences...

Audrey and Lydia had been burning through their contacts all night, desperately searching for any digital fingerprints linking Serena to the viral smear campaign against Vivian.

Their progress was agonizingly slow.

So far, they'd only uncovered clickbait accounts chasing internet fame—nothing concrete enough to pin on Serena.

Audrey groaned, massaging her temples as she scrolled through her contacts list for what felt like the hundredth time. "I'm staying with you tonight," she declared suddenly, locking her phone. "Serena's completely lost it. Who knows what she'll do next?"

Lydia calmly crushed her cigarette in the ashtray. "We should ask Mr. Blackwood for assistance."

Audrey rolled her eyes so hard it looked painful. "As if that man would lift a finger to help."

Lydia had gotten the abbreviated version of Vivian and Adrian's drama from Audrey last night.

While Audrey dismissed Adrian's actions as performative, Lydia wasn't so sure.

She'd seen the raw desperation in his eyes herself.

If Adrian truly didn't care, he could have easily delegated the search to his security team and washed his hands of the matter.

Instead, he'd personally led the charge—a telling detail that spoke volumes to Lydia.

But matters of the heart were complicated, and outsiders had no business interfering.

Before Vivian could respond to Audrey's suggestion, the doorbell's chime sliced through the tension.

"Who knows you live here?" Audrey asked, instantly on alert.

"Probably just food delivery," Vivian said, moving toward the door.

But when she opened it, Adrian stood on her threshold, still wearing yesterday's wrinkled dress shirt.

Up close, she could see the shadow of stubble along his jawline—the only visible sign of his exhaustion.

His deep voice, though weary, carried undeniable authority. "You're coming back with me."

Vivian barely glanced at him before attempting to shut the door.

Ethan materialized behind Adrian, blocking the door with his body. "Mr. Blackwood just returned from the police station," he explained urgently. "They still haven't located Maxwell, and this building has too many blind spots. It's not safe for you here alone."

Lydia and Audrey appeared at Vivian's side.

Lydia immediately sided with Adrian. "Vivian, you should go with Mr. Blackwood," she urged gently.
###Chapter 227

Audrey crossed her arms, her reluctance evident, but finally conceded with a sigh. "For once, he's actually being helpful. Might as well take advantage—having a personal bodyguard isn't the worst arrangement."

Vivian hesitated briefly, considering her options before nodding. "Alright. Give me five minutes to get my things."

Though her personal safety wasn't her primary concern, she couldn't risk delaying the production schedule over private matters.

Adrian's voice was quiet yet commanding. "I'll purchase anything you require."

Vivian ignored him and turned toward the bedroom.

Audrey followed her inside, leaving Lydia to handle the men in the living room.

She turned to Adrian with a professional smile. "Mr. Blackwood, please make yourself comfortable."

"Thank you." Adrian didn't need further invitation.

He strode into the living area and settled onto the sofa with effortless authority.

Stretching his long legs, he instructed Ethan to fetch him an iced tea from the kitchen.

Upstairs, Audrey leaned close to Vivian and whispered, "If you're moving back to Seabreeze Villa, play the devoted wife perfectly."

"Imagine Serena's face when she realizes her scheming only succeeded in bringing you back to Adrian's side. She'll be tossing all night in frustration."

Vivian nodded, her expression thoughtful yet determined.

This wasn't about petty vengeance.

She intended to create the illusion of reconciliation with Adrian to unsettle Serena, forcing her to make a fatal mistake.

If Serena's schemes were exposed, Vivian would finally have the proof she needed.

Whether Adrian chose to acknowledge it or not, she would use the evidence to clear her name and defend herself.

She refused to stand by while someone attempted to destroy her reputation and life.

In less than five minutes, Vivian descended the stairs with a tan backpack slung over one shoulder, carrying only her laptop and the Ambermyst script.

"Let's go," she said calmly.

"Of course." Adrian rose immediately, his steady gaze following her lead.

Lydia observed them closely, her conviction about Adrian's feelings growing stronger.

Despite his usual aloof demeanor, a billionaire CEO dropping everything to personally escort someone wasn't standard behavior.

Lydia leaned toward Vivian as they headed for the door. "Mr. Blackwood hasn't rested in twenty-four hours. Go back with him and get some proper sleep."

Ethan nodded in agreement. "He was at the hospital yesterday, but the moment he heard about your situation, he left immediately to find you."

Though Ethan's words were carefully neutral, their implication was clear: Adrian had chosen Vivian over Serena.

Audrey, however, remained unimpressed. "If Serena hadn't thrown Isabella out that night, we might have found Vivian sooner. She wouldn't have fallen into the ocean and nearly drowned. And now you're trying to play the hero? Please."

Vivian maintained a faint smile, her expression composed as she silently waited for Adrian to defend Serena.
###Chapter 228

Adrian's lips pressed into a thin line as he declared, "The receptionist has been dismissed."

Audrey let out a derisive laugh, tossing her hair dramatically. "How convenient. Passing the blame again, are we?"

Lydia swiftly pulled Audrey aside, shooting her a warning glance. "Audrey, enough. Don't push this."

Despite Adrian's attempt to shift responsibility, everyone could see he was still shielding Serena.

Vivian's voice remained steady, though her words cut like glass. "After all, if I, the temporary Mrs. Blackwood, were to leave, Blackwood Group's stocks would plummet. Whether it's your precious Serena's medical expenses or her entertainment investments, they're all bottomless pits, aren't they?"

Her gaze never wavered, her tone flat, yet the pointed remark made Adrian visibly flinch.

As she tucked a stray lock behind her ear, her sleeve slipped back, exposing angry red marks circling her wrist.

Adrian's eyes lingered on the marks, his throat working as if words refused to come.

The air grew thick with tension, an uncomfortable silence stretching between them.

Finally, Ethan stepped forward, taking Vivian's bag and slinging it over his shoulder. "Mrs. Blackwood, allow me."

He hadn't anticipated his attempt to score points with his boss would backfire so spectacularly.

Life was challenging enough without the added difficulty of being Adrian Blackwood's assistant.

Seabreeze Villa

Inside the lavish estate, Gwendolyn paced like a caged animal, her nerves frayed.

Two hours earlier, Ethan had called to inform her Adrian was bringing Vivian home to stay.

He'd instructed her to prepare for their arrival.

When Vivian had disappeared, Gwendolyn had secretly prayed she'd never return.

She hadn't expected the situation to backfire so completely.

Now not only was Vivian safe, she was returning to the villa.

Gwendolyn's anxiety had reached unbearable levels.

The chime of the doorbell snapped her from her spiraling thoughts.

Opening the door to Vivian's flawless face made her stomach drop.

Masking her dismay, Gwendolyn composed herself, forcing a polite smile.

She ushered Vivian in respectfully, presenting a fresh pair of slippers.

With feigned enthusiasm, she gushed, "I've been praying for your safe return, Mrs. Blackwood. My prayers have been answered. Now that you're back, everything will be perfect."

Adrian's tone brooked no argument as he stated, "An additional two thousand monthly in your salary."

Gwendolyn's eyes immediately brightened, her smile turning genuine. "Thank you, Mr. Blackwood! Thank you, Mrs. Blackwood!"
###Chapter 229

A few carefully crafted words had secured her a significant salary increase.

Vivian felt like she'd struck gold.

She glanced around Seabreeze Villa.

Everything remained unchanged since her departure.

Turning to Gwendolyn, she said casually, "Prepare a guest room—"

Adrian interrupted sharply. "I won't be returning soon, so it's unnecessary."

Vivian maintained her composure. "I'm not requesting sleeping quarters. I need a workspace."

She was laying groundwork for a bigger scheme.

To convincingly play reconciled spouses, they needed proper staging.

Pushing Serena to desperation would make her reveal her true colors.

Adrian's expression softened. "Convert the sunniest guest room on the second floor into a study. Order new furnishings for delivery by tomorrow."

He turned to Vivian, his tone unexpectedly even. "Anything else you require?"

Vivian considered briefly before answering. "A desktop computer with a large screen."

Writing scripts on her laptop had strained her posture.

If not for Serena's meddling, their divorce would have been finalized months ago.

Since circumstances forced this arrangement, she might as well maximize the benefits.

Adrian nodded toward Ethan, who immediately responded. "Right away, Mr. Blackwood. I'll see to it personally."

He handed Vivian's satchel to Gwendolyn.

The housekeeper clutched the bag, visibly shaken.

The sudden shift in dynamics unsettled her.

Unable to contain herself, she blurted out, "You'll be sharing a bedroom?"

Vivian's eyes narrowed. "Isn't that expected of married couples?" Her tone turned icy.

Gwendolyn quickly backtracked, forcing cheer into her voice. "Mrs. Blackwood, you misunderstand! I merely wondered if you and Mr. Blackwood were reconciling. I'm delighted for you both!"

Vivian's lips curved slightly. "My return should answer that question."

Taking her satchel from Gwendolyn's grasp, she added, "I'll take this upstairs myself. I'm exhausted and won't be joining dinner."

Without awaiting response, she ascended the staircase.

"Warm the milk in the refrigerator and bring it to the master suite," Adrian instructed Gwendolyn before following Vivian.

Upstairs, Vivian closed and locked the bedroom door.

Moments later, the sound of the lock disengaging startled her.
###Chapter 230

Vivian spun around to find Adrian standing in the doorway, his fingers clutching a silver key, his dark eyes locked onto her.

Her breath hitched as she scrambled to pull the silk robe over her bare shoulders. The fabric slipped through her trembling fingers twice before she managed to secure it.

Moonlight traced the elegant curve of her spine, highlighting the delicate dip of her waist before flaring into the soft swell of her hips.

Adrian remained motionless.

His gaze traveled over the exposed skin of her back, cataloging every angry red mark marring her porcelain complexion.

A muscle twitched in his jaw as fury and remorse twisted in his gut like twin vipers.

Those crimson streaks were a brutal reminder of her pain - pain he'd failed to shield her from.

"Ever heard of knocking?" she snapped, clutching the robe tighter around herself.

Wordlessly, he crossed the room and guided her to sit on the edge of the four-poster bed.

"What now?" Vivian exhaled sharply, irritation lacing her voice. "I'm exhausted, Adrian. Just let me sleep." She collapsed backward onto the duvet, her limbs heavy with fatigue.

Adrian released a quiet sigh, his expression softening into something unbearably tender.

As he reached to straighten her rumpled collar, Vivian's hand shot out to grip his wrist.

Her eyes blazed with defiance. "Is that all men think about? Even when I'm..." Her voice cracked. "Look at me! Do you want to traumatize me further just to satisfy your—"

The words died on her lips when Adrian produced a white medical kit from the nightstand. "Iodine," he said simply, popping open the case. "For your wounds. Not exactly the nefarious purpose you imagined." He shook his head, muttering, "Ungrateful little thing."

Vivian's cheeks burned.

Mortified, she grabbed the oversized stuffed rabbit from the bed and pressed her face into its plush fur.

"Do you realize how ridiculous you look right now?" Adrian's lips quirked as he soaked a cotton pad with antiseptic.

Vivian remained motionless, her face still buried in the toy.

His voice dropped to a teasing murmur, "You know what they say about ostriches burying their heads in the sand?"

She turned just enough to glare at him. "That's a myth! Ostriches dig holes to turn their eggs, not to hide from predators."

"Is that so, my little ostrich?" Adrian's eyes sparkled with mischief.

Realizing he'd compared her to the flightless bird, Vivian's flush deepened.

She twisted to swat at him but jolted when her injured arm brushed against the metal first aid box.

A sharp gasp escaped her lips.

"Stay still," Adrian commanded, his voice firm yet gentle.

Vivian complied, sinking back into the pillows.

He worked methodically, applying ointment to each angry welt with careful precision.

Some marks were already darkening into bruises while others still shone an angry crimson.

The silence between them grew thick with unspoken words.

Adrian's fingers lingered on a particularly nasty scrape near her collarbone.

Vivian held her breath.

The air hummed with tension.

Neither dared to speak.
###Chapter 231

The air between them grew heavy with unspoken tension.

"Did they bind your wrists?" Adrian's voice turned glacial, his fury simmering beneath the surface.

Vivian shrugged, her tone deliberately casual. "The men who took me in the parking garage used nylon cords. If the ocean currents hadn't weakened the knots..." She left the sentence hanging, the implication clear.

Adrian's gaze darkened dangerously, like storm clouds gathering before a tempest.

His next words came out in a deceptively calm whisper. "I've alerted Ashford PD. There's also a special reward circulating in certain circles."

The unspoken meaning hung between them - the bounty targeted the criminal underworld specifically.

"They won't live to see another sunrise."

Vivian didn't answer. Exhaustion finally claimed her, her breathing slowing as she surrendered to sleep.

Adrian studied her peaceful expression, the moonlight tracing silver along her cheekbones.

With careful movements, he adjusted the blankets around her before retreating to the nearby armchair.

A quiet rap at the door interrupted the silence.

Adrian moved swiftly, intercepting the sound before it could disturb Vivian's rest.

Gwendolyn stood in the hallway, holding a steaming mug.

"Her chamomile tea," the housekeeper murmured.

Adrian accepted the drink with a curt nod. "Cancel dinner service. I'll come down when she wakes. No disturbances."

The door clicked shut behind him as he returned to Vivian's bedside.

Placing the mug on the nightstand, he watched the steady rise and fall of her shoulders.

Hours slipped by unnoticed, the moon painting shifting patterns across the walls.

Vivian awoke to cold sheets.

Adrian's absence didn't surprise her.

She arched her back, muscles protesting after deep sleep.

Her phone screen glowed 11:47 PM when she checked.

Padding barefoot across the plush rug, she wrapped herself in a silk robe.

The hallway lay in perfect stillness.

Gwendolyn stood frozen near the staircase, her phone's blue light reflecting off her startled expression.

Thumbs flew across the screen before she noticed Vivian's approach.

"What are you doing up here?" Vivian's question sliced through the quiet.

Gwendolyn fumbled the device, barely catching it before impact.

The housekeeper's smile didn't reach her eyes.

###Chapter 232

"Oh, Mrs. Blackwood," Gwendolyn stuttered, hastily slipping her phone into the pocket of her starched apron. "Just a message from my daughter. I wanted to see if you required anything."

Vivian's piercing gaze lingered for a moment before drifting away. "What's available for dinner?" she asked, her voice cool and detached.

"We received a shipment of lobster tails this afternoon." The housekeeper's smile faltered slightly as she realized her mistake - those were meant for her own family's special occasion.

"Lobster will suffice."

"Bring it to my suite when prepared," Vivian commanded, already turning away.

Gwendolyn forced a tight-lipped smile. "Certainly, Mrs. Blackwood," she murmured with a stiff nod.

The door clicked shut without further acknowledgment.

Vivian never wasted energy on meaningless courtesies, particularly not with staff members whose false smiles couldn't mask their resentment.

The moment the heavy oak door closed, Gwendolyn's pleasant expression shattered.

Her face twisted into a scowl as she glared at the polished mahogany. "Ice queen," she hissed, fingers curling into fists at her sides.

The hot shower had worked wonders on Vivian's tense muscles, steam still clinging to her skin as she wrapped herself in a plush cashmere robe.

Settling onto the velvet chaise lounge, she opened her laptop with a sigh.

Against her better judgment, she navigated to Instagram.

The viral hashtags targeting her had disappeared from the trending section.

Adrian must have intervened with his usual ruthless efficiency.

Yet her notifications told another story entirely.

Dozens of hateful comments flooded her mentions, accusing her of using Sebastian Hartwell for clout.

Several warned the actor about her "gold-digging ways," complete with snake emojis.

Her jaw tightened as a dull ache pulsed behind her temples.

With an irritated swipe, she closed the app and switched to Messenger instead.

To her surprise, her inbox overflowed with unread messages.

Concerned colleagues, relieved friends, even distant acquaintances had reached out during her absence.

A genuine smile softened her features as she scrolled through the heartfelt notes.

The outpouring of support eased the tightness in her chest, if only slightly.

Damien Vaughn's message stood out among the rest.

"Minimum one week's rest before returning to set!" it read in all caps. "Doctor's orders! Violate this and I'll deduct 300K from your next paycheck!"

She chuckled despite herself, responding with a playful middle-finger emoji.

Beneath his gruff exterior, the studio head's concern was palpable - though the financial threat still stung.

After several heated exchanges, they compromised on five days of mandatory rest.

###Chapter 233

A serene quiet settled over the room as Vivian Hartley retrieved her laptop from the leather satchel. The glow of the screen illuminated her focused expression as she reopened the screenplay file.

Only three scenes remained unfinished in this collaboration project. She flexed her fingers, ready to tackle the final revisions.

The sharp rap at the door shattered her concentration.

"Mrs. Blackwood? It's prepared," came Gwendolyn Pierce's crisp voice through the oak door.

"Enter," Vivian commanded, pushing the laptop aside with deliberate care.

The door swung open to reveal the housekeeper balancing an ornate silver tray. Gwendolyn moved with calculated grace, placing the meal on the side table with surgical precision.

"I prepared these specially for you, Mrs. Blackwood," she murmured, retreating two steps to allow inspection.

The tiger prawns glowed like jewels under the chandelier's light, their citrusy aroma mingling with hints of garlic and chili. Vivian selected one, the crisp shell giving way to succulent flesh that melted on her tongue.

"Acceptable," Vivian acknowledged with a dismissive wave. "You may leave. I'll return the tray later."

Gwendolyn dipped her head. "As you wish, Mrs. Blackwood."

As she turned toward the exit, her gaze snagged on the open laptop screen. A predatory gleam flashed in her eyes as she discreetly retrieved her phone from her apron pocket.

One silent click later, the screenplay's contents were captured. The corners of her mouth twitched upward as she ghosted from the room, the door clicking shut behind her.

Across town in the penthouse of Seabreeze Villa, Serena Whitmore sat coiled like a viper on her Italian leather sofa. Her manicured nails shredded the velvet upholstery as waves of fury radiated from her rigid form.

Everything had been flawless. Maxwell Sterling's predictable actions had provided the perfect alibi. The raging storm, the frayed ropes - every detail meticulously planned.

Yet somehow, Vivian Hartley kept cheating death.

The crash of shattering porcelain barely registered as Miranda Graves barked orders at the trembling staff. The marble floor glittered dangerously with the remnants of Serena's earlier tantrum.

Then her phone vibrated.

Serena snatched the device, her scowl deepening until she saw the message contents. Her breath hitched. The screenplay she'd commissioned - the one that was supposed to be her comeback vehicle - was actually Vivian's work?

Back on set two days later, Vivian found herself drawn to the familiar chaos of production despite doctor's orders. During the lunch hiatus, an unexpected figure materialized through the craft services tents.

Julian Montclair cut through the crowd effortlessly in his tailored white athletic wear, the sunlight catching the subtle silver threads woven through the fabric. His artfully disheveled hair and easy smile made him look like he'd stepped straight out of a coming-of-age romance.

The whispers began instantly among the crew. Vivian's fingers tightened around her script pages as he approached, that infuriating smirk playing at his lips. Whatever game he was playing now, she'd be ready.
###Chapter 234

Vivian's eyes lit up with surprise as she spotted him approaching. She stood gracefully, smoothing her skirt. "Julian, what a pleasant surprise!"

"I figured you could use some refreshments," Julian replied with an easy smile, motioning to his team who followed with multiple designer shopping bags.

Turning to the production crew with practiced charm, his voice carried warmth. "I appreciate everyone taking such good care of Vivian here."

"Thank you, Mr. Montclair! We're actually celebrating Vivian's birthday today!" Isabella chimed in, her excitement contagious as others began arranging an impromptu dining space.

Julian's assistants laid out an exquisite spread - herb-roasted turkey, artisan sandwiches, and an assortment of beverages including matcha lattes and cold brews.

The hungry crew gathered eagerly, each selecting their gourmet boxed meals as they found seats.

Julian settled across from Vivian, reaching for a salad bowl when his gaze caught on a nearby phone.

The unlocked screen displayed an active Instagram feed.

"Does this belong to anyone?" he inquired, pointing to the device.

A flurry of pocket-checking ensued among the group.

Isabella gasped, patting her empty pockets. "Oh! That's mine - must have set it down while setting up." She hurried over, cheeks pink with embarrassment.

Julian gave a gracious nod. "No trouble at all," he said smoothly, handing it back.

Nearby, a cluster of young actors watched the exchange with barely concealed curiosity.

One bold actress called out with a grin, "So Vivian, is this your mystery man?"

Only Isabella knew the truth about Adrian and Vivian's complicated history, leaving the others free to speculate wildly.

Vivian laughed airily, waving a dismissive hand. "Oh goodness no! We went to university together. Back then, every girl on campus had a crush on him."

Her voice trailed off as she realized how many years had passed since they'd last spoken. She had no idea about Julian's current romantic status.

With playful curiosity, she nudged his arm. "Speaking of which, Julian Montclair - are you off the market yet?"

Julian carefully placed a slice of turkey in his box before answering with an amused smile. "Still very much single."

Vivian turned to her colleagues with exaggerated enthusiasm. "Ladies, take note! The most eligible bachelor in Crestwood is right here - and he still remembers his manners!"

A supporting actress leaned forward, eyes sparkling with recognition. "That suit - is it the new Armani Privé collection? I swear I saw it on their Instagram last week."

Julian glanced down at his attire with modest disinterest. "Could be. I just liked the clean lines." His effortless humility only enhanced his sophisticated aura.
###Chapter 235

Vivian's mind wandered back to the luxurious yacht they'd been aboard earlier, connecting the dots about Julian's undoubtedly wealthy background.

Across the room, Sebastian stared at the nearly depleted coffee carafe, his expression falling. "No more caramel macchiatos left?"

Isabella pushed forward her untouched drink. "You can have mine," she offered. "Haven't taken a sip yet."

Sebastian hesitated. "You sure you don't want it?"

"Honestly, I just grabbed it without thinking," Isabella replied with a casual wave. "I'm not particular about my caffeine fix."

"Let's trade then," Sebastian insisted, swapping his milk tea for her coffee.

From his seat, Julian observed the exchange briefly before turning his attention to Vivian. "Did you manage to contain that social media firestorm?"

Vivian exhaled heavily, poking at her chicken drumstick. "Mostly. But the damage is done - now I'm branded as some fame-hungry social climber fabricating a relationship with Sebastian."

Sebastian slammed his cup down, anger flashing across his handsome features. "Those aren't real fans! I checked their profiles - half are bots and trolls stirring up drama. I should call them out publicly or sic our lawyers on them."

"Absolutely not!" Vivian cut in sharply. "Remember our WhatsApp conversation? Silence is our best weapon here. Even if those accounts claim to defend you, your genuine fans could get caught in the backlash."

Harrison mopped his brow with a handkerchief before interjecting. "You'll only make things worse for Vivian, Sebastian. The harder you try to protect her, the more your fanbase will resent her. Managing you is like herding hyperactive kittens at a daycare center."

Julian methodically arranged apple slices in his bowl. "What if the production team tweeted about your authentic interactions?" he suggested.

Harrison shook his head. "The crew's endorsement won't carry much weight. Fans would just assume they're covering for Vivian."

"Fair point," Vivian agreed, spearing a piece of honeydew with her fork.

Noticing Julian's apple assortment, she remarked casually, "You're really into apples, huh? Never been my favorite."

Julian crunched into a crisp slice. "Then what about a crew member who's genuinely Sebastian's fan? Someone who witnesses your daily dynamic could provide credible testimony."

"No chance!" The trio - Vivian, Sebastian, and Harrison - responded in perfect unison.

Vivian took a breath before explaining. "Julian, you might not understand. It's extremely rare for production staff to be die-hard fans."

Sebastian added his own cautionary tale. "We had an incident where an obsessed staffer secretly recorded me. Nearly caused major leaks before our film premiere. That's why Ivory Phoenix Productions now bans hiring known fans."

Julian tilted his head, curiosity sparking in his eyes. "But what if one slipped through the cracks?"

Vivian's voice turned pragmatic. "True fans would be active in fan clubs, voting campaigns, and concerts. With today's digital verification systems, it's nearly impossible to hide. And casual fans? Their testimonials wouldn't hold any weight."
###Chapter 236

The afternoon sunlight filtered through the cafe windows as Julian set a peach iced tea before Vivian. His voice carried a thoughtful note. "Life rarely deals in absolutes. Though I suppose there might be... one exception?"

His gaze drifted unconsciously toward Isabella, who sat biting her lower lip, her knuckles white around her smartphone.

To most who knew him, Julian Montclair was the eternal optimist - hopelessly idealistic.

Yet out of respect for his genuine warmth, people rarely challenged his worldview directly.

Instead, they'd exchange knowing glances and smoothly steer conversations elsewhere.

Vivian wiped barbecue sauce from her fingers with a napkin. "Coming to watch filming today?"

"Not this time," Julian replied with a regretful smile. "I've got a job interview this afternoon."

Vivian's eyebrows lifted. "Planning to settle in Crestwood?"

"Without question." Julian's smile deepened. "My roots, my friends..." He trailed off meaningfully. "Everything important to me is here. I'm definitely coming back."

Glancing at his wristwatch - a luxury timepiece worth seven million sterling - he added, "Running late now. I'll catch you on set another day."

Vivian recognized the watch immediately.

Adrian owned a similar model, though his carried a twelve-million price tag.

She remembered the sales associate presenting various options that day, how she'd joked about identical-looking watches with wildly different values.

It had felt like an elaborate con for the ultra-rich.

Adrian had patiently explained the subtle craftsmanship differences - a lesson that still stuck with her.

She knew two other watches from this collection belonged to Blackwood family members.

Julian's wasn't the limited edition, suggesting he'd purchased it overseas.

When afternoon filming wrapped, crew members clustered around a mint-green luxury sedan parked nearby.

"That color is divine! Absolutely breathtaking!"

"A car like that out here? Must belong to Sebastian!"

Harrison shook his head. "Sebastian only drives black cars."

Realizing she couldn't avoid the attention, Vivian stepped forward. "It's my family's car."

The crew, familiar with Vivian's identity as Katrina, showed little surprise at her access to such vehicles.

After brief murmurs, they dispersed.

As Vivian approached, Ethan emerged to open the rear door formally. "Mrs. Blackwood."

Inside, Vivian's first question came sharp. "What are you doing here?"

"Can't I occupy my own vehicle?" Adrian's eyebrow arched, his tone glacial.
###Chapter 237

Vivian adjusted herself in the leather seat, her lips curling into a mocking smile. "You loathed this shade when I picked it out. Haven't touched it in months. Did my colleagues' compliments suddenly make it fashionable?"

Adrian gave her that infuriatingly condescending look. "You're the one who insisted on discretion. This was the most practical choice."

Her retort died as she turned to Ethan. "It's still too flashy. Bring that rust bucket of yours next time."

Ethan's jaw tightened. "Of course, Mrs. Blackwood."

His prized car—a year's salary saved meticulously—was worth seven figures.

And now both his boss and wife called it scrap metal. First Dominic, now Vivian.

Poor Ethan.

As his fingers brushed the ignition, his phone vibrated violently.

"Mr. Blackwood," he announced, "it's the precinct."

Vivian's hands clenched, knuckles bleaching white. "Did they—is it Maxwell?"

Adrian's palm covered hers, radiating steady warmth. "Let's hear what they say first," he murmured, nodding at Ethan to answer.

That simple contact anchored her, a lifeline in churning waters.

Ethan's "Thank you, we appreciate the update" sounded strained.

The call ended. His face darkened. "Maxwell escaped—"

A weighted pause. Then, directly to Vivian: "Natasha...he assaulted her. She's in emergency care now."

——

The hospital room smelled of antiseptic and despair.

Natasha lay motionless, an oxygen mask obscuring half her battered face.

Purpling bruises distorted her features beyond recognition. One arm, encased in plaster, rested at an unnatural angle.

If one looked closely, they might notice the faint tremor of her lashes. Or how her uninjured hand fisted the starch-stiff sheets.

She'd been awake for hours. Avoiding the police. Avoiding reality.

Maxwell hadn't come alone.

The past days blurred into a waking nightmare—strange hands, leering faces, pain layered upon humiliation.

To survive, she'd swallowed her screams. Played compliant. Let them parade her degradation like a trophy.

Now?

She was broken merchandise. No respectable family would want damaged goods. Not even as a mistress.

Her nails bit into her palms, drawing crescent moons of blood.

The hatred burned brighter than the pain.

###Chapter 238

Natasha seethed with resentment toward Vivian. How had Vivian escaped such a horrific fate?

The injustice burned in Natasha's chest. Why was she the one suffering while Vivian remained untouched?

If only Vivian had been the one violated and lost at sea, Natasha wouldn't be trapped in this nightmare.

Now, consumed by vengeance, Natasha's only purpose was to make Vivian experience the same agony, to drag her down into the abyss.

Outside Natasha's hospital room, officers interrogated Richard Dawson, whose face showed visible discomfort.

Beside him, Daphne Fairchild's usual polished appearance had vanished.

Her hair was pulled back carelessly, her makeup-free face revealing deep lines of exhaustion.

"This is outrageous!" Richard protested. "My daughter's been assaulted, yet you're treating us like suspects instead of finding the real criminals!"

The lead detective met his gaze steadily. "We take Miss Dawson's trauma very seriously. However, Maxwell Sterling, the identified ringleader, is connected to another abduction case—" His eyes flicked between Richard and Daphne, watching for reactions.

Daphne's tears abruptly stopped. She looked away abruptly.

Richard frowned. "Natasha barely leaves the house. How could she be involved in any kidnapping?"

The officer's voice hardened. "The other victim appears to be Vivian Hartley—your other daughter."

"Vivian?" Richard whirled on Daphne. "What the hell is going on here?"

"I—I don't know anything!" Daphne stammered, dabbing at dry eyes with a tissue. "My daughter's the victim here! How can you expect me to think about anything else?"

Before Richard could respond, approaching footsteps drew their attention.

Vivian and Adrian Blackwood strode down the corridor, with Ethan Caldwell following like a shadow, his presence more commanding than the officers'.

Daphne sprang up. "What are you doing here? Come to gloat over Natasha's suffering?"

Vivian's expression remained unreadable. "I don't keep score with people beneath me."

"Besides," she added coolly, "I only look forward, never back. Why would I waste energy on those I've already surpassed?"

Richard's face darkened. "Vivian! That's enough! How dare you speak to Daphne like that? Where are your manners?"

Vivian lifted her chin. "Manners are wasted on someone who tried to have me killed."

"What vile accusation is this?" Richard raised his hand threateningly.

Adrian intercepted the blow effortlessly. "Strike my wife in front of me, and you'll have the entire Blackwood family to answer to."
###Chapter 239

Adrian's grip tightened around Vivian's shoulder as Richard Dawson's face turned crimson with humiliation. "Mr. Blackwood, Vivian is still my daughter. As her father, I have every right—"

Before he could finish, Adrian released his wrist with a sharp flick. "Father?" His voice dripped with disdain. "Do you deserve that title?"

Richard staggered backward, collapsing onto the hospital corridor bench with a thud.

Daphne rushed to his side, shooting Adrian a venomous glare after ensuring Richard was unharmed. "The police are right here. Do you think you're above the law, Mr. Blackwood?"

Adrian methodically wiped his fingers with a sanitizing wipe, his nose wrinkling as if touching something foul.

He tossed the used wipe into the nearest bin with deliberate precision. "He was about to strike my wife. I was merely protecting her." His glacial gaze locked onto Daphne. "But if you're suggesting I could act without restraint..." A dangerous smile played on his lips. "That could be arranged."

Daphne's face went ashen, her trembling lips unable to form a response.

One of the officers cleared his throat. "We've briefed Mr. and Mrs. Blackwood. As the victim, Vivian not only has the right to case updates but must assist our investigation." Their disapproving glances toward Richard spoke volumes.

Watching Adrian's controlled demeanor, the officers saw no need to intervene.

Daphne dabbed at dry eyes with a tissue. "Victim? More like perpetrator! Everyone knows Maxwell Sterling was once her fiancé. She was supposed to marry into the Sterling family years ago—God knows how she tricked her way into the Blackwoods instead. And now we hear she's been sneaking around Emberglow County reconnecting with Maxwell?" Her voice turned shrill. "My daughter lies unconscious because of her scheming!"

The blatant accusation hung in the sterile hospital air.

Richard's expression twisted with undisguised loathing—not a trace of paternal concern for Vivian remained.

Even bystanders couldn't help but pity the young woman caught in this toxic family dynamic.

Adrian's arm around Vivian tightened protectively, his silent support as tangible as armor.

Vivian met Daphne's gaze unflinchingly. "We haven't spoken in years. How would you know about Emberglow County? Or my supposed contact with Maxwell?"

Adrian studied his wife's poised demeanor, marveling at how far she'd come from the broken woman who'd first sought his help.

Daphne's eyes darted away. "A... a friend's child from Emberglow saw everything. They told us."

Vivian's lips curved into a knowing smile. "You and Father cut ties with everyone from our hometown years ago. Since when do you have 'close friends' in a place like Emberglow County?"

Beads of sweat formed on Daphne's forehead—she looked more rattled than during any police questioning.
###Chapter 240

Adrian pulled Vivian closer, fixing Serena with an icy glare. "Do I need your permission to have friends now?"

Serena gave a careless shrug before addressing the officers. "I had some issues while filming in Emberglow County, and Maxwell happened to assist me." She turned to Adrian with a knowing smile. "Doesn't this all feel a bit too convenient, darling?"

She slipped her arm through his and batted her lashes.

"The timing is suspicious indeed. We should investigate this so-called friend thoroughly." Adrian looked down at her, his stern expression melting into quiet admiration.

The lead detective nodded. "Could you provide this friend's contact information for verification?"

Vivian hesitated, then glanced at Natasha lying motionless on the hospital bed. "Actually, Natasha was the one who communicated with him. You'll have to wait until she wakes up." She assumed the police couldn't proceed while Natasha remained unconscious.

The detective saw through her deception immediately. "Know that providing false statements to obstruct justice carries serious legal consequences."

A flicker of panic crossed Vivian's face, but she stood her ground. "I'm telling the truth."

With no immediate way to verify her claims, the officers moved on, summarizing the situation involving Natasha and Maxwell.

Ethan checked his buzzing phone.

After reading the message, he stepped forward. "Regarding the suspects in Mrs. Blackwood's case—"

"The kidnapping suspects were apprehended in Ashford. They confessed Maxwell orchestrated the entire operation before suddenly passing away in custody."

The detectives exchanged relieved glances. "We'll arrange for their transfer—"

Ethan shook his head grimly. "That won't be possible. They suffered sudden health complications and died before questioning could be completed." His pointed emphasis on "died" was accompanied by a meaningful look at Vivian.

Vivian's grip on Richard's arm tightened, her face draining of color.

The terrifying realization hit her—this was no accident.

Adrian's earlier warning echoed in her mind—the Blackwoods truly had the power to make people disappear!

On the hospital bed, Serena remained perfectly still, absorbing every word.

At first shocked, she gradually accepted the truth.

If she was going down, she'd make sure Vivian joined her in whatever came next.

Seabreeze Villa

After leaving the hospital, Vivian and Adrian returned to their luxurious home.

Settling onto the plush sofa, Vivian studied Adrian as he typed on his laptop beside her. "You've been home much more than usual lately. Any particular reason?"

It was unusual to see the notoriously workaholic CEO spending so much time at the villa.
###Chapter 241

The only reason Vivian didn't suspect Adrian was being forced out of Blackwood Group was knowing any leadership change would make front-page news.

Adrian's fingers stilled on the keyboard. His icy gaze met hers as he stated, "This is my rightful place too."

Vivian blinked, momentarily speechless.

Their tense silence was interrupted by Gwendolyn's arrival, bearing an exquisite crystal bowl of steaming soup. Fresh papaya slices floated atop the creamy coconut milk broth, creating an artful presentation.

"Mrs. Blackwood, I brought you our signature papaya coconut fish maw soup," Gwendolyn offered with practiced grace, placing it before Vivian with hopeful expectation.

Vivian took a delicate sip. "Not quite as refined as Beatrice's version at Blackwood Manor," she remarked casually.

Her thoughts drifted to that memorable bowl Beatrice had prepared - the one Serena had shamelessly claimed for herself.

A flicker of irritation crossed Gwendolyn's features before she schooled her expression. "Please try again, Mrs. Blackwood. This was prepared by a Michelin-starred chef personally recommended by my son."

The chef in question had been sending lavish gifts to Gwendolyn ever since her son suggested him to impress Adrian.

While the soup was certainly palatable, Vivian set down her spoon decisively after Gwendolyn's persistent urging.

Adrian intervened smoothly, "If Mrs. Blackwood isn't enjoying it, there's no need to force the matter."

"Of course, Mr. Blackwood," Gwendolyn murmured, bowing her head to hide her bitter expression.

Since Vivian's return, Gwendolyn had been systematically cut off from her usual lucrative schemes.

Vivian was preparing to establish some boundaries when her phone buzzed with Lydia's call.

"You're dismissed," she told Gwendolyn with a wave before answering. "Lydia? What's happened?"

"Vivian! Have you checked Twitter? Isabella just publicly defended you! Sebastian's fans are actually calming down!" Lydia's excitement crackled through the speaker.

Vivian frowned. "What exactly did Isabella say?"

Before she could process the information, Adrian had already pulled up the tweet on his tablet. Instead of handing it to her, he drew her close against his side, sharing the screen in an intimate embrace.

Too absorbed in reading, Vivian barely registered the protective gesture.

Isabella's post painted a detailed portrait of Vivian's relationship with Sebastian - one of mentorship and sibling-like care, emphasizing Vivian's positive influence without any ulterior motives.

She revealed Vivian and Sebastian shared a history that would be explained after their current project due to contractual obligations.

The message stressed their bond was built on mutual healing and genuine affection, completely devoid of romantic or exploitative undertones.
###Chapter 242

The post included raw, unfiltered snapshots and a direct capture from an Instagram account run by Sebastian Hartwell's most devoted fan.

Isabella Thornton ended her statement with poignant words: "Sebastian was my guiding star, and Vivian is the one who illuminates his universe now." She added, "Even if this costs me my position, I'll shield his radiance at all costs. I may return to darkness, but I want my own glow to forever bask in his sunlight."

This particular fan was legendary in Sebastian's fandom circles, having bankrolled multiple initiatives to support his career.

The fanbase immediately rallied behind her testimony, valuing her insider perspective and Sebastian's discernment, dismissing the unfounded gossip circulating online.

Vivian was stunned. "So Isabella is a Sebastian stan! That explains her career switch from acting to makeup artistry—just to stay near him! Coming forward like this might get her fired..."

She urgently called Lydia Bennett. "Lydia, Isabella just defended me publicly. I need to contact Mr. Vaughn immediately to vouch for her. Despite being Sebastian's fan, she's maintained complete professionalism and always prioritized his interests."

Lydia chuckled reassuringly. "No need to worry, Vivian. Adrian already secured her position. Mr. Vaughn confirmed she's staying. Firing her over this would destroy crew morale."

Then Lydia added with admiration, "You somehow always become the eye of the storm. This media frenzy is giving our show incredible organic promotion."

Their call ended shortly after.

Only then did Vivian notice Adrian's arm resting possessively around her shoulders.

As she considered removing it, he asked curiously, "Why would such a reserved makeup artist suddenly go public after being so private?" He remembered Isabella as painfully shy, not the type for bold declarations.

"A fri—someone mentioned during a set visit that having a genuine Sebastian fan speak up would carry more weight than any PR statement."

While explaining, Vivian subtly lifted his arm away, creating deliberate distance between them.

"A friend? You mean Julian, don't you?"

Adrian's gaze lingered on the space she vacated, still feeling her warmth. His eyes trailed down to her delicate ankles, noticing the faint blue veins beneath pale skin.

Vivian pressed her lips together in silent confirmation.

Leaning back casually, Adrian probed, "I thought Ivory Phoenix Productions had strict policies against hiring actors' obsessive fans. How would he know to suggest that?"

She shrugged dismissively. "Probably coincidence. He might not even be aware of their hiring policies."

"How coincidental can it be? He randomly suggests this, and there just happens to be a perfect candidate in the crew?"

Vivian's mind flashed back to that pivotal moment.

###Chapter 243

Vivian's phone had been in Adrian's line of sight for just a moment. Could he have spotted something revealing her growing affection for Sebastian? Was this all part of some calculated game he was playing?

She dismissed the thought almost immediately.

Adrian wasn't the scheming type. Besides, how much could anyone really deduce from a fleeting glance at a phone screen?

Dominic, noticing her pensive expression, leaned forward with genuine concern. "You might want to be careful around him. That kind of attention could lead to complications."

Vivian's eyes flashed with irritation. "I don't recall asking for your opinion on my personal relationships!"

She adjusted her position, crossing her legs with deliberate grace and lifting her chin in defiance. The movement accentuated her curves beneath the fitted dress.

Adrian's gaze darkened as it traveled over her form.

There was no denying it - she possessed that rare kind of beauty that commanded attention, the sort that made men forget their better judgment.

Even her marital status hadn't stopped admirers from circling like sharks. Since handing him those divorce papers, her return to the spotlight had only magnified her radiance, like a diamond finally freed from its dusty setting.

Vivian caught his lingering stare and arched an eyebrow. "Like what you see? I've been working hard on this figure. Could give any runway model a run for her money." She deliberately emphasized her cleavage. "Especially up here."

The memory of his past criticisms still stung.

"That's quite the ego you've developed," Adrian remarked, forcing his eyes away. "Most people don't praise themselves so shamelessly."

"Don't confuse confidence with arrogance," she shot back. "You were the one staring. Now you're pretending you weren't? How very mature."

Adrian hesitated, then leaned closer with a wolfish grin. "Maybe I just needed the right incentive." His voice dropped to a husky whisper. "You always did know how to get my attention... especially between the sheets."

The playful teasing had taken a distinctly flirtatious turn, charged with the memory of their recent intimacy.

Vivian wavered, uncertain whether to break the tension or let it build.

The sudden vibration of Adrian's phone on the coffee table shattered the moment.

"You should get that," she said quickly, seizing the opportunity to put space between them.

Her eyes caught the caller ID - Serena's name flashing across the screen.

Her expression cooled instantly as she recalled Serena's role in her recent near-disaster.

With icy precision, she said, "Before you critique my friendships, perhaps examine your own associations."

"I'd appreciate it if Serena stayed out of my way. Better yet, ask her about her true motives. I may no longer be Mrs. Blackwood, but her inability to marry into your family isn't my problem. She shouldn't take her frustrations out on me."

Adrian looked stunned, the forgotten phone still buzzing in his hand.

Just moments ago, they'd been teasing and playful. Now Vivian was building walls again.

###Chapter 244

Adrian paused, his piercing gaze locking onto Vivian. "Is that jealousy I detect?"

Vivian arched an eyebrow, her voice laced with steel. "I'm being perfectly rational. That scandal? Entirely her doing. Maxwell only found out about my location because of her obsessive fans - that's what triggered his kidnapping scheme."

The persistent buzzing of Adrian's phone filled the tense silence.

His brow furrowed as he studied Vivian's determined expression. "Do you have concrete evidence?"

"Not yet," Vivian admitted, her tone softening slightly as she adjusted her silk blouse. "But I will uncover the truth."

Without another word, she turned on her heel and ascended the spiral staircase, her designer heels clicking against the marble steps.

Adrian glanced at his vibrating phone - an unprecedented moment of hesitation.

He silenced the call with a swipe, typing instead: "In negotiations. What's urgent?"

Upstairs, the guest suite had been transformed into a writer's sanctuary.

Floor-to-ceiling windows framed a panoramic view of Crestwood's glittering skyline, the city lights twinkling like scattered diamonds.

A sleek, modern desk of polished ebony dominated the space, flanked by a plush velvet chaise lounge and a minimalist bookshelf curated with rare first editions.

Every element had been meticulously arranged to foster creativity - from the ergonomic chair to the strategically placed mood lighting.

Vivian's earlier irritation had dissipated, replaced by a contemplative stillness as she settled into her workspace.

The massive curved monitor before her illuminated the dim room, casting blue shadows across her sharp features.

As she logged into her messaging platform, Julian Montclair's profile picture pulsed with notification.

His chosen image - a delicate porcelain teacup steaming against misty mountain peaks - perfectly encapsulated his reputation as the reclusive poet-philanthropist.

His message was characteristically direct: "Visited a colleague today who mentioned your friend Audrey investigating the trending topic. They confirmed your suspicions about Serena's involvement. While I understand your history, since your series hasn't premiered, she currently poses minimal professional threat."

Vivian's fingers hovered over the keyboard.

Their first meeting at the harbor had been abrupt, leaving many details unshared.

She typed with deliberate clarity: "I should clarify - I've been married for two years. To Adrian Blackwood."

"Serena is Adrian's former partner. The tabloids constantly speculate about them, though they're careful never to explicitly identify him."

She couldn't presume Julian's knowledge of her marital status - transparency seemed wisest.

His response came swiftly, bypassing any surprise: "I'll investigate this for you."

The ellipsis of his typing indicator pulsed like a heartbeat.

Then:

"Consider it done."
###Chapter 245

Vivian's fingers hovered over the keyboard as she reread Julian's message. There was something unsettlingly familiar about his commanding tone that reminded her of Adrian's forceful demeanor.

She blinked rapidly, dismissing the absurd comparison.

Julian was all warmth and charm, the polar opposite of Adrian's brooding intensity.

This was what happened when you spent too many late nights writing dramatic scripts - your imagination started seeing connections where none existed.

With careful politeness, she typed: "That's very kind of you, Julian, but I wouldn't want to impose. You've just gotten back to Crestwood and must have your own affairs to handle. I can take care of this myself."

His reply came instantly: "We're friends, aren't we? It's no trouble. I have connections in the industry that might prove useful."

He'd boxed her into a corner with his persistence, leaving no polite way to refuse.

Exhaling slowly, Vivian sent back a heart emoji with folded hands.

Just then, Audrey's message popped up: "You'll never guess who I ran into today!"

Not in the mood for games, Vivian typed bluntly: "Julian Montclair."

The three bouncing dots appeared immediately, followed by Audrey's shocked response: "What the—how did you know?"

"He mentioned it. Offered to help with the investigation," Vivian replied.

Audrey's excitement exploded across the screen in a rapid-fire barrage of texts:

"Don't you think he's way too involved in your life? That moment at the harbor when he and Adrian locked eyes—straight out of a romantic rivalry scene!"

"Seriously, after your divorce, you should give Julian a shot."

"He's just as gorgeous as Adrian but actually treats you with respect. Adrian's all brooding intensity while Julian's a proper gentleman!"

"And remember when you thought he wasn't into women?"

"Maybe it's because he's been secretly in love with you this whole time! What if he came back specifically for you? The universe works in mysterious ways. You've always played second fiddle to Serena, but to Julian, you're the leading lady."

Vivian stared at her phone, momentarily speechless.

Finally, she typed: "You should be writing scripts, not me. Stop spinning fairy tales. I told him I'm married."

Audrey remained undeterred: "So? Marriage isn't a life sentence. You're practically divorced already. The timing couldn't be more perfect!"

Vivian massaged her temples as a dull ache began forming.

Desperate to change the subject, she asked: "Want to come over for dinner tonight?"

After a brief pause, Audrey replied: "Can't. Dominic booked us at this impossible-to-get-into restaurant. No way I'm missing this!"

The mention of Dominic made Vivian recall how he'd shadowed Audrey at the harbor incident.

What she'd dismissed as coincidence now seemed suspiciously deliberate.

"When did you and Dominic get so... close?" Vivian typed, curiosity getting the better of her.

Audrey's defensive reply came instantly: "I swear it's not what you think! I didn't betray you! We met by chance, and I had no idea he was Adrian's friend at the time!"
###Chapter 246

Vivian continued explaining how their lives had become intertwined again.

As their chat flowed, the topic circled back to Vivian's complicated relationship with Adrian.

"Honestly," Audrey typed, "Adrian's behavior seems off lately. Now that you're both living at Seabreeze Villa again, tell me truthfully - do you still want that divorce?"

Without hesitation, Vivian replied, "Absolutely. But not right now. First, I need to handle the Serena situation - at minimum, I must guarantee my future safety. The divorce could actually give me leverage when dealing with her."

Audrey instantly responded with a heart-eyes emoji. "Darling, ever since you stopped being lovesick, you've become so much sharper."

Smirking, Vivian closed the messaging app.

She spent the next hour polishing the script she'd been working on all week before sending it to Ivory Phoenix Productions.

The response came quickly: "Please hold for now. Our sponsor has concerns about upcoming plot points. We'll update you soon."

Vivian didn't dwell on it.

The production company had always been reasonable and accommodating, so she assumed this was just a temporary delay.

After logging out, she stretched and decided to grab a snack from the kitchen.

In the living room, Adrian sat stiffly on the sofa, his expression unreadable.

Ethan stood before him with several takeout bags on the coffee table.

Spotting Vivian, Ethan brightened immediately, pulling out a steaming container. "Mrs. Blackwood, Mr. Blackwood asked me to bring this fish maw soup from Blackwood Manor. It's freshly made - please try some."

Vivian accepted the container and took several spoonfuls.

Just as she finished, her phone rang.

It was Beatrice.

"Vivian dear, did you get the soup?" Beatrice's warm voice asked.

Smiling, Vivian dabbed her lips. "Yes, just finished. It was wonderful."

Beatrice's tone turned scolding. "Good you enjoyed it, but don't overdo these tonics. Too much fish maw can cause health issues."

"Don't worry, I didn't eat much," Vivian said, glancing pointedly at Adrian. "The last batch you sent? Adrian fed it to a dog."

Deliberately, she turned on speakerphone so Adrian could hear clearly.

Beatrice's voice turned sharp. "Nonsense! Even dogs shouldn't eat such rich food! Their health matters too!"

Adrian's face darkened, realizing the jab was meant for Serena.
###Chapter 247

Adrian hesitated before responding stiffly, "Understood, Beatrice."

Vivian paused, her brow furrowing. "Wait, since when does Seabreeze Villa have a dog?"

Margaret's tone was light, almost playful. "Oh, it's just a stray Adrian picked up. He might bring it home eventually."

Vivian accepted the explanation without question and ended the call after exchanging a few more pleasantries.

The moment the line disconnected, the air in the room grew thick with tension.

Adrian's piercing gaze locked onto Vivian, his expression unreadable.

Vivian remained perfectly composed.

Meeting his stare with equal intensity, she said simply, "I'm starving. If you're planning to lecture me, can it wait until after I've eaten?"

Adrian didn't rise to the bait.

Instead, his voice softened slightly, though the words still carried a sting. "Serena didn't have an easy childhood."

"She might have her flaws and occasional outbursts, but she's fundamentally good. She'd never intentionally hurt anyone."

The words hit Vivian like a physical blow.

So he wasn't oblivious to Serena's behavior - he simply chose to excuse it, leaving Vivian to suffer the consequences.

Had he ever considered her own struggles? Her own imperfect upbringing - a cold, calculating father, a life starved of genuine affection - yet she'd chosen to rise above it.

Circumstances might shape a person, but they didn't dictate character.

Adrian was testing her patience yet again.

Suppressing her rising anger, Vivian countered sharply, "What kind of twisted logic is that? How can you separate someone's temperament from their character? If my hand committed murder, would you claim only my hand should face consequences while I walk free?"

An uncomfortable silence descended.

Adrian's jaw twitched, as if he wanted to argue but found himself at a loss for words.

Finally, he exhaled and changed tactics. "Gwendolyn prepared your favorite dishes," he offered quietly.

Adrian would conjure the most absurd justifications to defend Serena.

Vivian merely nodded. "Noted," she said, moving toward the dining area.

She had no interest in wasting energy on such pointless debates.

The truth was glaringly obvious to anyone with sense. Adrian was no fool - his business acumen proved that much.

Yet when it came to Serena, his judgment became clouded beyond reason.

Given this reality, Vivian could only wait patiently, gathering undeniable evidence of Serena's deceit.

The day she presented it to Adrian, she intended to shatter his illusions once and for all.
###Chapter 248

Vivian didn't expect Adrian to defend her when the truth came out.

But every piece of evidence she gathered strengthened her position against his first love.

Gwendolyn entered the dining room, carefully arranging the dishes.

She brushed past Vivian, heading toward Adrian while drying her hands. "Mr. Blackwood, Memorial Day is this weekend. My hometown is quite far, and I'd like to request additional days off."

Vivian's fork froze mid-air.

Her mother's memory flashed before her eyes.

She'd been so absorbed in work that she'd forgotten to visit her mother's grave.

Without Gwendolyn's reminder, Memorial Day might have completely slipped her mind.

Adrian glanced at Vivian. "You're in charge of household matters. Discuss it with her."

Vivian spoke softly, maintaining her composure. "Take the week. Message me if you need more time."

"Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Blackwood," Gwendolyn replied quickly.

Vivian met Adrian's gaze. "I'm visiting my mother's grave in my hometown for Memorial Day. I won't be returning with you."

After Catherine's death, Richard had been preoccupied with his new wife, leaving funeral arrangements to Eleanor, who had taken Catherine's ashes home.

"I have business there. I'll accompany—" Adrian began, interrupted by his ringing phone.

His hesitation was evident as he looked at Vivian.

Vivian instantly recognized Serena's call. She turned away, continuing her meal. The lightly seasoned dishes perfectly suited Adrian's taste—another reminder of how Gwendolyn catered to his preferences.

Adrian hesitated before answering.

Serena's sugary voice carried through the receiver. "Adrian, I'm free Memorial Day. Let's visit Silverpine?"

His response was cool and distant. "Serena, the Emberglow County development has sparked interest in neighboring areas. I need to assess renovation potential. I'll send you a card—buy whatever you like. I'll arrange company for you."

Vivian stabbed a shrimp with unnecessary force, biting into it as if it were Adrian himself.

As Gwendolyn passed by, she muttered just loud enough to hear, "Mr. Blackwood is always so generous with Ms. Whitmore. She must be drowning in money by now."

Vivian caught the barbed comment, wondering if it was directed at her.

Not that it mattered.

Money wasn't the issue—Adrian had always been lavish with her too.

What hurt was the difference in how he treated her versus Serena.

For Serena, he offered explanations and reassurances. For Vivian, only blank checks and cold indifference.

After two years of marriage, she remained excluded from his business and personal life.
###Chapter 249

"Adrian, you don't care about me anymore," Serena's voice dripped with petulance through the phone. "You missed my check-up, and now you're refusing to go to Silverpine. What if I need another heart transplant? Would you just abandon me then?"

His voice turned razor-sharp. "Don't even say that! You won't need another transplant."

Realizing her misstep, Serena's tone melted into honeyed sweetness. "Adrian, that's not what I meant."

Vivian froze mid-bite, Serena's words chilling her to the bone.

So Serena had received a heart transplant.

A hazy memory surfaced - Adrian once mentioning Serena's "good heart." Had he meant the actual organ?

And if so, what was the connection?

The puzzle pieces hovered just out of reach, one crucial fragment still missing.

Adrian's voice softened, the earlier edge replaced with soothing warmth. "Don't dwell on it. Transplants aren't something you undergo casually. It won't happen again. By the way, you liked that pink Porsche, didn't you? I'll have Ethan bring it over."

After more coaxing, Serena finally relented and ended the call.

Adrian pocketed his phone and turned back to Vivian. "I'll accompany you to the cemetery."

She blinked, his words pulling her from her thoughts.

"No need," she said tersely. "I want to speak with my mother privately."

"I'll drive you," he insisted, leaving no room for argument.

"Fine," Vivian muttered, her mind still spinning around Serena's heart.

Could Adrian's unwavering devotion to Serena stem from something more profound?

She stole a sideways glance at him, lips parting as if to voice her question.

But ultimately, she lowered her head and continued eating in silence.

What would knowing change? Would it dull the sharp edges of her anger, or simply provide another excuse to forgive him?

A single highway connected Crestwood to Vivian's hometown, Willowbrook - a route infamous for holiday traffic jams. Fortunately, with Sebastian scheduled for an awards ceremony, the production granted early leave. To beat the rush, Vivian suggested departing a day early.

After packing, she tucked some bread into her suitcase.

"No need for that," Adrian said. "Willowbrook's developed rapidly this year - faster than other counties. They've even opened a new hot springs resort with excellent dining."

"I'm not staying at a resort. I'll be at my grandmother's apartment," Vivian countered, retrieving the bread and stuffing it back before zipping her suitcase shut.

Adrian looked taken aback. "You hadn't mentioned that before."

Vivian arched a brow. "Why would I? Traveling together was all I agreed to, not sharing accommodations."
###Chapter 250

Adrian turned to Ethan with a commanding tone. "Prepare a travel kit with snacks." Vivian, irritated by Adrian's habit of making unilateral decisions, rose abruptly from her seat.

"You were never invited to stay with me," she snapped, her annoyance evident.

Predicting her reaction, Adrian remained unruffled. "Staying alone isn't wise. While the resort area is developing, the residential zones remain unchanged since your childhood—barely more advanced than Emberglow County. If trouble arises, I wouldn't know immediately. Safety demands we stay together."

Vivian found herself momentarily silenced.

With a self-satisfied smirk, Adrian directed Ethan to pack provisions as if they were embarking on a spring picnic.

Vivian sank back onto the sofa, observing their preparations, when her phone's ringtone interrupted.

Audrey's cheerful voice came through. "Darling, what are your holiday plans?"

"I'm visiting Willowbrook to pay respects at my mother's grave," Vivian answered.

Without hesitation, Audrey declared, "I'll join you."

Vivian arched an eyebrow. "It's dreadfully dull there—no entertainment or decent food. You'll be bored stiff."

But Audrey, ever the optimist, countered, "Perfect! I adore tranquility. I'll grab my bag and meet you at your place so we can depart together."

"We're already loaded in the car," Adrian's voice unexpectedly interjected from behind, making Vivian jump.

Audrey adapted instantly. "No problem! I'll arrange my own transportation and meet you at the highway junction."

Before Vivian could protest, Audrey had already hung up.

Surveying the mountain of luggage Ethan was handling, Vivian remarked dryly, "Seems we're forming a caravan now."

Adrian selected a sleek luxury sedan for their journey.

During the drive, Adrian remained engrossed in work calls, discussing staggering financial sums, while Vivian focused on her laptop. Hearing him casually mention figures like "800 million" or "90 million," Vivian couldn't help contrasting them with her own modest earnings.

Yet she found reassurance. Career focus had significantly boosted her confidence in dealing with Adrian. Hard work wasn't about competing with elites, she realized, but about cultivating independence—freeing herself from reliance on relationships or romantic fantasies for fulfillment.

When they stopped at a florist, Ethan exited the vehicle. Noticing Vivian's curious glance in the rearview mirror, he explained, "Mr. Blackwood requested perfume roses."

These roses, Catherine's favorite two decades prior, had become scarce locally. Vivian usually purchased them in Crestwood for such occasions.

She'd planned to visit a florist before hitting the highway, but discovered Adrian had already arranged everything.

Ethan returned with the roses arranged in a nostalgic, classic style—99 blooms interspersed with baby's breath. Placing the fragrant bouquet in the front seat, their sweet perfume soon filled the car's interior.
###Chapter 251

Adrian had clearly gone above and beyond with this thoughtful gesture. Touched, Vivian whispered a quiet, "Thank you."

Engaged in his video conference, Adrian didn't acknowledge her words. The way his brows furrowed in concentration, the sharp intensity in his gaze, and the rigid set of his jaw only accentuated the aristocratic perfection of his profile.

As they neared the highway exit, an unusual amethyst-colored SUV stood out conspicuously among the sea of monochrome vehicles.

Ethan smoothly pulled their car alongside it, and Audrey immediately leaned out from the passenger window, calling excitedly, "Vivian!"

Dominic, seated behind the wheel, also leaned forward with a casual wave. "Hey there, Vivian. Adrian."

Vivian blinked in surprise at Dominic's presence. Closing her laptop, she asked, "Dominic? What brings you here?"

Before he could respond, Audrey cut in, "He had some free time and offered to help. Hiring a driver for such a long distance gets expensive, and I'm trying to be more budget-conscious now that I'm independent."

Adrian shot them a skeptical look, clearly unconvinced by her explanation.

Brushing off his scrutiny, Audrey suggested brightly, "Let's not dwell on that. Vivian, why don't you join us in here? We can squeeze into the back together. I've downloaded tons of movies - we can have our own little cinema!"

"Absolutely!" Vivian agreed enthusiastically, quickly exiting their car. She'd grown weary of overhearing Adrian's discussions about multi-million Sterling deals, finding them increasingly disheartening.

She slid into the SUV's backseat, and as she reached to close the door, she noticed Adrian stepping out of his vehicle.

His expression remained impassive as he stated, "I could use a break from work. I'll join you for the movie."

Audrey promptly slammed the door shut before he could enter. "Sorry, we're all out of space."

Up front, Dominic pretended not to notice the exchange, discreetly pressing the accelerator as Adrian approached.

Left standing alone, Adrian's expression darkened with visible irritation.

As they drew closer to Willowbrook, Vivian's initial cheerfulness faded. Memories of her childhood in that town, of her grandmother and mother, began surfacing with increasing intensity.

Suddenly, her phone buzzed with Adrian's call. His voice came through clearly, "Would you like to stop and visit your mother before we go home?"

Vivian glanced out the window, noticing that Adrian had lowered his rear window at some point. He held his phone to his ear, his piercing gaze fixed on her.

Though her window remained up, making it impossible for him to see her clearly, the intensity of his stare gave her the unsettling sensation that he could see right through the glass - as if he could peer directly into her soul.

Her heart fluttered unexpectedly as she replied softly, "Yes, that would be nice."

After ending the call, she turned to Audrey. "I need to visit my mother's grave first. Why don't you and Dominic grab something to eat?"

Audrey paused the movie on her tablet and looked up. "Don't be silly. We're coming with you."

Dominic checked the rearview mirror and added, "We're not hungry anyway. Paying respects to your mother is more important since we're all here together."
###Chapter 252

The cemetery was undergoing expansion when they arrived, leaving the grounds in chaotic disarray. Construction debris blocked the road, forcing them to park and continue on foot.

Adrian carried a bouquet of crimson roses in one hand while gripping Vivian's fingers tightly with the other. The weathered stone steps, partially buried under loose soil, made Vivian stumble as she searched for stable footing. Adrian remained an immovable anchor beside her.

This was typical of him - always her steadfast protector. That unwavering sense of security had once been her greatest comfort, something she'd clung to desperately, even when it cost her self-respect.

Now, as she contemplated putting distance between them, that familiar safety felt dangerous, threatening to weaken her resolve. Distracted by these thoughts, she turned to Audrey. "Let me help you."

Audrey, preoccupied with scanning their surroundings, scoffed. "With those delicate arms? Please." She grabbed Dominic's sleeve instead. "Are you blind? I need assistance here!"

Dominic immediately adjusted his stance to support her. "You could've just asked."

"Must I spell out every little thing?" Audrey snapped irritably.

Vivian's attempt to escape Adrian's protective grasp failed. With a quiet sigh, she faced him again, seeking distraction. "Is it just me, or is there something... unusual between Audrey and Dominic?"

Adrian kicked a stray branch from their path, lips quirking. "Finally noticing?" His teasing tone implied she'd been remarkably slow on the uptake.

She shot him a glare. "Audrey's a good person—"

"The kind of 'good' who introduces you to male escorts?" Adrian countered. Vivian stiffened. "Don't go there. Just make sure he doesn't hurt her."

Adrian chuckled. "They're adults. Their romantic choices aren't my concern."

Vivian had no rebuttal.

"Wait—who's that?" Adrian suddenly stopped, gaze locking onto a figure ahead.

Vivian looked up just in time to see a gray-hooded figure moving with unnatural grace, retreating swiftly before disappearing behind a row of tombstones. The sudden movement startled her, making her miss a step and nearly fall.

Adrian's strong hand caught her elbow, pulling her upright. His frown deepened. "Must you always be so reckless?"

Vivian's glare could have melted steel. "If you hadn't startled me, I wouldn't have tripped! People visit graves all the time, you know."

Audrey and Dominic caught up, Audrey pointing ahead with widened eyes. "Viv, isn't that your mother's grave? Who left those flowers? Does anyone else visit her?"

Following Audrey's finger, Vivian saw the bouquet of champagne roses resting against the headstone, their petals glowing softly in the muted light. A strange sensation prickled at her mind.

She whirled around instinctively, but the hooded figure was gone. In the distance, a sleek black sedan glided past the cemetery gates. Her chest tightened with uneasy recognition. Could it be...? For a fleeting moment, she thought of Julian.

###Chapter 253

The memory surfaced unexpectedly—her freshman year at university, that stormy afternoon when she'd missed the bus back to Willowbrook. Frustrated and drenched, she'd stepped out of the terminal only to collide with destiny itself. He hadn't spoken much, just silently offered her a ride home. But lifetimes had passed since then. This had to be coincidence. Eleanor and Catherine had always been beloved by many.

An old acquaintance paying respects wasn't unheard of, was it? Vivian pushed the thought away with practiced indifference. "Probably one of Mother's old colleagues."

Audrey wrinkled her perfect nose, skepticism dripping from her expression. "That man didn't look 'old colleague' material to me. I'd say he was... devastatingly handsome!"

"From a two-second glimpse of his retreating figure? Please," Vivian countered, rolling her emerald eyes.

Dominic crossed his arms with a scoff. "For all we know, he's one of those 'great-from-behind' types. Turn him around and you'll find a balding accountant losing the war against middle age."

Audrey shot him a look that could curdle milk. "Even his silhouette outshines you from every conceivable angle."

"Me? Outshined?" Dominic's voice cracked comically.

Adrian's icy tone sliced through their bickering like a scalpel. "If you must behave like children, take it elsewhere."

The usual joker of their group, Dominic visibly shrunk under Adrian's glare, miming a zipper across his lips with exaggerated obedience.

For once, Audrey didn't press further, her features softening with uncharacteristic solemnity. "Show some respect, Dominic. We're in a place of mourning."

Dominic held his tongue, though he couldn't resist sticking out his tongue at Audrey's back when she turned away.

The group approached Catherine's polished granite headstone. Adrian placed an arrangement of white lilies before the engraved portrait, bowing deeply. "Catherine, it's been too long."

Vivian's throat tightened. Adrian had only accompanied her here once before—shortly after their wedding. Now, with divorce papers looming between them, this would likely be their final visit together.

Audrey and Dominic paid their respects in turn, murmuring introductions to the stone. As they straightened, Dominic tugged Audrey's sleeve, whispering loudly, "I'm starving. Let's scout some lunch options."

Audrey gave him an exasperated look, but he responded with an elaborate series of eyebrow wiggles. "Vivian," Audrey said, taking the hint, "we'll go find somewhere decent to eat."

"You stay and talk to your mother."

Vivian nodded. "Alright." She turned to Adrian. "You should go with them."

Adrian's gaze remained fixed on the horizon, his profile sharp against the pale sky. "The view's better up here. I want to see Willowbrook's skyline from this vantage point."

Vivian didn't argue. The others departed, their figures growing smaller down the winding path until she stood alone before the grave.

She settled onto the cool stone steps, brushing away autumn leaves before unwrapping the mysterious second bouquet—blood-red roses without card or note.

Drawing her knees to her chest, Vivian whispered to the silent marble, "Mother, I'm getting divorced. I've finally learned love isn't mathematics—no matter how much you invest, sometimes the equation simply won't balance. Knowing when to walk away isn't surrender; it's survival. Life's too long to only look forward, but no one teaches you when to glance back. I learned that through scars, Mother. I haven't taken proper care of myself or Grandmother. Forgive me."

Tears she'd dammed for months broke free, carving hot paths down her cheeks as everything she'd locked away came pouring out.

###Chapter 254

The marble stone felt cool beneath Vivian's fingertips as she knelt before her mother's grave. Here, in this quiet sanctuary, she could let her guard down completely. The carefully constructed walls around her heart crumbled like autumn leaves, revealing the wounded girl beneath.

Golden sunlight faded into twilight, painting the cemetery in hues of violet and indigo. A whispering wind danced through the cypress trees, carrying the scent of damp earth and distant rain.

Vivian, who used to tremble at ghost stories, now found solace among these silent sentinels. After surviving two brushes with death, she knew true monsters wore human faces. These peaceful graves would never betray or hurt her. And her mother's spirit would shield her from any restless shadows.

The evening chill crept into her bones. Shivering, she hugged herself tighter and rose to leave. One last touch to the engraved name - Catherine Sutton - before turning away.

Suddenly, warmth enveloped her shoulders. She whirled around to find Adrian standing there, his expression unreadable in the fading light. Without speaking, he adjusted his jacket around her, then drew her close with an arm across her shoulders.

Facing the headstone, his voice carried quiet reverence. "Catherine, it's getting late. We'll be staying in town a few more days and will visit again."

Vivian hesitated, then murmured her own farewell. Slipping from his embrace, she properly fastened the oversized jacket and gave him a brief nod.

Adrian caught her hand, his tone teasing but gentle. "If you take another tumble and end up in the ER, how will you maintain that tough-girl image?"

She shrugged, avoiding his gaze, but didn't pull away as they descended the hillside. Their fingers somehow became intertwined, though hers remained stiff, refusing to properly clasp his.

Rejoining Dominic and Audrey outside the cemetery gates, they followed Audrey's lead to a hidden gem - a decades-old barbecue joint tucked between residential buildings. Back in her school days, Vivian and friends would save allowances for weeks to afford meals here.

Adrian, usually fastidious about cleanliness, made no complaint about the humble establishment. He discreetly sanitized their table with antibacterial wipes while maintaining perfect composure.

Their luxury vehicles drew curious stares during the dinner rush. Passersby slowed their steps, some snapping photos with their phones. Murmurs floated through the evening air: "That's a Blackwood Group car! What would a billionaire be doing in our little town?"

Catching the whispers between bites of grilled eggplant, Vivian turned to Adrian with playful curiosity. "Mr. Blackwood, the locals are wondering... what brings a man of your stature to our rural backwater?"

Dressed simply in a black Henley that somehow looked designer, Adrian exuded effortless elegance. As he dabbed sauce from the corner of Vivian's mouth, he replied, "You once told me about growing up here. How you dreamed of seeing it prosper. That if you ever had the means, you'd help develop this place and surrounding areas."

He tactfully omitted her exact words to spare her pride. Vivian had originally said, "If I weren't trapped in marriage, I'd use my resources to help my hometown and neighboring poor regions... Maybe someday someone capable will come along. I'd be forever grateful to that person."

Vivian looked away, surprised he remembered and embarrassed by her past vulnerability. Meanwhile, Audrey and Dominic's playful scuffle over the last chicken wing ended when Audrey's fork slipped, allowing Dominic to claim victory with a triumphant grin.
###Chapter 255

Vivian studied Adrian with narrowed eyes. "You expect me to believe you traveled all this way because of some offhand remark I made years ago? Out of the goodness of your heart?"

Adrian hesitated briefly before adding, "There was... another influence."

The admission snuffed out the fragile warmth beginning to blossom in Vivian's chest. She found perverse comfort in this revelation - it was better if Adrian remained emotionally unavailable, making her divorce resolution easier to maintain.

Audrey slammed her fork down with a derisive snort. "Let me guess - that manipulative witch Serena? Adrian, why bring her up now? Just to ruin the mood?"

"It's not about her," Adrian replied evenly.

"Right," Audrey scoffed. "Typical man. Always lying through his perfect teeth."

Dominic, mid-bite of his chicken, hastily set it down and clamped a hand over Audrey's mouth. "Don't make assumptions," he chided.

Audrey responded by sinking her teeth into Dominic's palm.

"Christ! Since when do you bite like a rabid dog?" Dominic yelped, examining the distinct teeth marks now decorating his hand.

Ignoring the commotion, Adrian took a slow sip of water, his gaze drifting to Vivian. She pretended not to notice, quickly finishing her meal. "I should go prepare the apartment... though it's quite small. Just two bedrooms."

Ethan immediately interjected, "Mrs. Blackwood, I'll reserve rooms at the Harbor Grand."

Dominic tugged at Audrey's sleeve. "We should stay at the hotel too."

Audrey arched an eyebrow. "Who said I wanted to share a room with you? Planning something indecent?"

"Indecent?" Dominic sputtered. "I booked separate rooms! After traveling all day, do you really want Vivian to have to make up another bed?"

"Fine," Audrey conceded. "Hotel it is."

Adrian remained silent, and Vivian assumed he'd choose the hotel as well. Turning to Ethan, she asked, "May I have the car keys? I need to get my things."

Ethan glanced at Adrian before answering, "Mrs. Blackwood, go ahead. I'll bring your luggage shortly."

"Thank you," Vivian said, then addressed the group. "I'll handle apartment arrangements tomorrow. Everyone else can do as you please. Don't worry about me - I've got instant noodles. I'll be fine alone."

Audrey pouted until Dominic leaned in, whispering, "She came to visit her mother's grave. Let her have this time."

Accepting his explanation, Audrey simply nodded. "Alright."

With that, Vivian rose and departed. As she left, Dominic turned to Adrian. "Where are you staying tonight?"

"None of your concern," Adrian replied sharply, shooting Dominic a warning look before following Vivian out.

The neighborhood surrounding Eleanor's apartment complex smelled of decades-old brick and climbing ivy. Narrow paths wound between buildings where the scent of home cooking mingled with snippets of conversation drifting through open windows. In its worn simplicity, this place held more genuine warmth than any glittering metropolis ever could.

###Chapter 256

The evening air carried the scent of blooming jasmine as Vivian neared the iron-wrought gates of her childhood neighborhood. Beneath the sprawling oak trees, clusters of familiar faces gathered in their usual spots, their voices weaving through the twilight like threads of memory.

A plump matriarch with silver-streaked hair fanned herself lazily. "Seems all our old neighbors have moved away," she lamented. "These new young couples only drag themselves home after dark, too exhausted for proper conversation. Soon our evenings will be silent as tombs."

"Then why stay?" snapped a middle-aged woman slapping at mosquitoes. "Your son bought you that lovely condo in Crestwood. Yet here you remain, sweltering like the rest of us."

The older woman's fan stilled. "Roots grow deep with age, child. Young saplings may bend with every wind, but old oaks need familiar soil."

A gaunt woman leaning on a cane nodded. "Remember Eleanor from 3B? Strong as an ox until she moved to Crestwood with that granddaughter of hers. Last I heard, she's in the hospital." Her voice dropped. "Haven't spoken in months. I do worry..."

Vivian froze mid-step. Eleanor Sutton was her grandmother.

The mosquito-slapping woman lowered her voice conspiratorially. "It's not the climate. Crestwood's barely an hour away." She let the implication hang before continuing. "Her daughter died right after marriage - husband was unfaithful, they say. Raised that granddaughter alone. Now the girl married into wealth but always visits the cemetery solo. Ever seen her husband? Two generations of misfortune - enough to break any woman's spirit."

Vivian's fingers tightened around her purse straps. The last time Adrian had accompanied her to visit her mother's grave, they'd deliberately avoided staying at her childhood home to evade prying eyes.

Murmurs rippled through the group.

"Never seen hide nor hair of that husband."
"Money changes men. Small-town girls can't handle city wolves."
"Maybe they're already divorced."
"Like father, like son-in-law - probably keeps mistresses too."
"Or maybe he's some hideous troll too rich to care about looks."
"Probably looks like a bulldog chewing a wasp."

Vivian's lips twitched despite herself. Their imaginations had run wild - though they'd guessed right about everything except Adrian's devastating good looks.

"Planning to stand out here all night?" A familiar baritone cut through the gossip.

Adrian Blackwood emerged from the shadows, his tailored suit clinging to his broad shoulders like liquid midnight. The neighborhood women gasped collectively as moonlight caught his chiseled features - the very antithesis of their imagined "bulldog."

Vivian watched realization dawn across their faces as Adrian slid an arm around her waist. His touch burned through the thin fabric of her dress as he pressed a kiss to her temple. "Grandmother's waiting," he murmured, his breath warm against her skin.

The gossiping circle had gone utterly silent, their mouths hanging open like stranded fish. Vivian allowed herself a small, satisfied smile as Adrian guided her through the gates, his presence radiating quiet dominance.

Behind them, the fan clattered to the pavement.
###Chapter 257

Vivian whirled around in surprise. The lively chatter in the courtyard died instantly as all eyes turned toward the unexpected visitor. Facing Adrian's sudden appearance, Vivian forced a polite smile and stepped toward the group. "It's been a while, everyone. I came back to visit my mother's grave."

"You grow more beautiful each time we see you, Vivian," the neighbors replied casually, their eyes flickering with curiosity toward the unfamiliar man. "And who might this gentleman be?"

With effortless charm, Adrian inclined his head. "Good evening. I'm Adrian Blackwood, Vivian's husband."

Behind him, Ethan appeared bearing carefully selected gifts. Adrian's arm slipped around Vivian's waist with practiced ease. "Vivian often speaks of your kindness. We brought some small tokens of appreciation."

Ethan distributed the presents - premium tobacco, aged whiskey, and imported health supplements. The neighbors accepted them with stunned expressions. Wasn't this the man rumored to be indifferent toward Vivian? The one supposedly resembling some barnyard animal?

Each woman now clutched an expensive gift bag, their attitudes shifting instantly. Smiles bloomed as they crowded closer, voices dripping with sudden admiration.

"How fortunate Vivian married into such a distinguished family! As women, finding a good match is our greatest achievement. If only Vivian's mother could see her now - she'd rest easy knowing her daughter is so well cared for."

"Vivian was always the prettiest and smartest girl in our neighborhood. She deserves this happiness!"

"Remember when Vivian got into university? Even the mayor came to congratulate her."

"Your grandmother mentioned her medical treatments cost a fortune daily. With such a devoted husband, she needn't worry about anything. I'm sure she has the best doctors money can buy."

"This young man is absolutely dashing. You two look like you stepped right out of a romance novel."

Vivian wasn't surprised by their sudden change of heart. These women loved gossip and small favors, but beneath their nosy exteriors beat genuinely kind hearts. They'd often brought discounted groceries when times were tough for her and Eleanor.

Adrian's smile softened. "If anything, I'm the lucky one."

When Vivian met his deep gaze, she saw her own reflection shimmering in those dark eyes. For a breathless moment, the charade almost felt real.

His acting had reached Oscar-worthy levels today. No wonder so many actors fell for their co-stars - the line between fiction and reality blurred dangerously when emotions ran high.

Even knowing their relationship was contractual, Vivian found herself momentarily swept up in the fantasy.

An elderly woman tucked her gift away and nudged her companion. "You should take notes. Early marriage clearly worked wonders for Vivian."

The middle-aged woman paused unpacking her gift with an irritated huff. "Don't start! My daughter's pickiness drives me mad. She's waiting for some fairy tale prince to sweep her off her feet!"

An image flashed through Vivian's mind - a girl who walked like she owned the world, nose perpetually in the air, barely acknowledging others. Clarissa, the woman's daughter, had been Vivian's childhood rival growing up as the only two girls in their building.
###Chapter 258

Clarissa Thornton had never cared much for books. Her passion lay in meticulously comparing outfits, toys, and social circles. Meanwhile, Vivian Hartley, who lived with Eleanor Sutton, couldn't afford many new clothes. Every time Clarissa flaunted a new dress, she made sure to parade it right outside Vivian's doorstep.

As years passed, Vivian pursued higher education while Clarissa remained stuck in their small town. Their lives diverged, and they grew apart. Vivian paid little attention to local gossip. After exchanging brief pleasantries, she and Adrian Blackwood headed upstairs.

Moments after they disappeared, Clarissa zoomed back on her electric scooter.

Spotting her mother outside, she rushed over excitedly. "Mom! Did you see that insane luxury car down the block? It looks straight out of a billionaire romance! That thing's gotta be worth millions!"

Her mother gave her a withering look. "Don't be ridiculous! A million-Sterling car in our neighborhood? Do you even know how much money that is? If we sold every apartment on this street, we still wouldn't come close!"

"You just don't understand," Clarissa huffed, quickly masking her irritation with a practiced smile. She resolved to wake up early tomorrow, determined to catch a glimpse of what might be a real-life Cinderella story.

Her mother tapped Clarissa's forehead playfully. "You're the same age as Vivian, yet she's already married to that tall, handsome man who brings us gifts. You always had to compete with her growing up - first with grades, now with marriage prospects. What's next? Still daydreaming at thirty?"

Noticing the gift bag in her mother's hand, Clarissa peeked inside with mild disinterest. The image of that luxury car still burned in her mind. She tossed the box back dismissively. "Just some snacks. Nothing special. When I marry my CEO, I'll be handing out diamond necklaces to the whole block."

"Have you completely lost touch with reality?" her mother scolded.

Ignoring the remark, Clarissa wheeled her scooter toward the parking shed.

Upstairs in the apartment...

Vivian pushed open the door, her tone brisk but casual. "Just set everything in the living room."

Ethan Caldwell placed the bags down, glancing around the modest space. He straightened, hesitating before speaking. "Mrs. Blackwood, let me help you tidy up."

Vivian was already moving toward the dust-covered furniture. "No need. I've got this. You should rest."

Ethan's eyes flicked uncertainly toward Adrian, who stood silently by the entrance.

"Meet me at the alley at eight tomorrow," Adrian said, his voice calm yet leaving no room for discussion.

"Yes, sir." Ethan gave a quick nod before exiting.

The door clicked shut behind him, leaving the apartment in silence. Dust motes danced in the late afternoon sunlight as Vivian surveyed her childhood home, acutely aware of Adrian's presence filling the small space. His expensive cologne mingled oddly with the familiar scent of old wood and lemon polish.

She moved to open a window, her back to him. "This place must seem..."

"Familiar," Adrian finished quietly. "In a good way."

Vivian turned, surprised to find him studying a faded photograph on the wall - her twelve-year-old self grinning beside Eleanor Sutton. His fingers hovered near the frame, not touching, as if afraid to disturb the memory.

For the first time since their arrival, Vivian saw something unguarded in his expression. Not the polished businessman or the dutiful grandson-in-law, but someone who understood what it meant to hold onto fragments of the past.

The moment shattered when a loud engine roared outside. Clarissa's unmistakable laughter floated up through the open window, followed by the screech of her scooter tires.

Adrian's mask slipped back into place. "We should get started if we want to finish before dark."

Vivian nodded, pushing aside the strange intimacy of that fleeting moment. There were boxes to pack, decisions to make, and a grandmother's legacy to honor. The photograph watched silently as they began their work, two very different people moving carefully around each other in the cramped apartment, each carrying secrets too heavy to name.
###Chapter 259

Vivian halted mid-step, turning to Adrian with a questioning tilt of her head. "Aren't you supposed to be leaving?"

"Where exactly would I go?" Adrian countered, yanking the protective sheet off the couch with a swift motion.

The quiet snick of the door closing signaled Ethan's discreet exit.

The apartment felt cozy—a stark contrast to the sprawling master suite at Seabreeze Villa. Adrian's imposing frame seemed to shrink the already compact living space.

Vivian moved with practiced efficiency through the rooms, peeling away years of dust covers. Each revealed piece of furniture brought flashes of her childhood—memories carefully preserved beneath the protective fabric.

"Sit," she commanded, flinging a dust cover aside. She grabbed a water bottle from Ethan's provisions and thrust it toward him. "Hydrate."

Her gaze flicked to Adrian. "Stay out of my way. You're taking my room tonight—I'll sleep in Grandma's."

He remained silent, settling onto the couch with the unopened bottle clutched in his hand.

Sunlight streamed through the south-facing windows—the apartment's perfect orientation keeping it warm in winter and pleasantly cool in summer, never requiring artificial climate control.

As Vivian continued her cleaning frenzy, Adrian flipped open his laptop. His fingers danced absently over the keys, his attention repeatedly drawn to her movements.

Her hair was piled carelessly atop her head, exposing the elegant line of her neck. Even performing mundane chores, she moved with the precision of a dancer—every motion purposeful, every posture perfect.

He found himself wondering if this same effortless grace had once filled Seabreeze Villa when she managed the household.

Finally, Vivian uncovered the pièce de résistance—an upright piano. Its ebony surface gleamed under the sunlight, its simple design belying its extraordinary craftsmanship.

Adrian's sharp eyes immediately caught the embossed gold "S" near the logo—a custom Steinway from the Sutton family collection, its value dwarfing even the grand piano at Blackwood Manor.

The most distinctive feature was undoubtedly the gold-embossed "S" beside the manufacturer's mark—the exclusive insignia of the Sutton family in Crystalpeak.

"That was Grandpa's," Vivian murmured, pulling him from his thoughts.

Her fingers trailed lovingly across the polished wood, a nostalgic smile playing at her lips. "I heard it's priceless. A gift from one of his admirers."

She paused, expression softening with memory. "When I was seven, I spilled juice on it. Grandma punished me—the only time she ever did. She was so furious, I thought she'd never speak to me again."

Adrian's brow furrowed slightly. The Sutton family was renowned for patronizing artistic talent.

Yet if her grandfather had such connections, how could they have stood by while Richard mistreated Catherine? He pushed the troubling thought aside, focusing instead on Vivian's flushed cheeks.

The physical exertion had brought color to her face, giving her a radiant glow in the warm light. Something stirred in his chest, and he took an absent sip from the bottle.

Before reason could stop him, Adrian rose and crossed the room in three long strides. His arm snaked around her waist, pulling her firmly against him.

The sudden movement startled Vivian. Her hand flew out, landing on the piano keys with a discordant crash. She stiffened immediately, turning her face away as her breathing quickened. "Don't," she whispered, voice unsteady.
###Chapter 260

Adrian leaned in, his lips grazing her cheek before settling near her ear. His breath was warm, carrying the faint scent of sandalwood and spice. "Play for me," he murmured, his voice rough and intimate in the small space between them.

Vivian's pulse spiked. Normally, she would have refused outright, but the intensity in his dark eyes left her flustered. She took a step back, pressing a hand against his chest to create distance. "What do you want to hear? I'm not a concert pianist. I only know beginner pieces—and that song from Beatrice's birthday."

The mention of his grandmother's celebration made his lips twitch in amusement. "If someone had asked for another song that night," he teased, "wouldn't your little secret have been exposed?"

"Move." She nudged his foot with hers.

Adrian stepped aside, watching as she pulled out the piano bench and sat down. She glanced up at him, posture poised but with a defiant glint in her eyes. "No one did," she said simply.

He chuckled, leaning against the wall beside her with effortless ease. "Then play that one."

Vivian's fingers hesitated over the keys at first, testing a few notes before finding their rhythm. The melody flowed smoothly, her movements graceful and deliberate, as if she were performing for an unseen audience.

The golden glow from the window cast soft light across her features, highlighting the concentration that made her almost ethereal.

Adrian's gaze drifted, lingering on the slight forward tilt of her posture before dipping lower. He stiffened, a strange mix of guilt and fascination tightening in his chest.

He forced himself to look away, but something—some invisible pull—drew his attention back to her.

The music swelled, then faded, the final note hanging in the air like a whispered secret. Before she could rise, Adrian stepped forward. Without a word, he lifted her onto the piano.

Vivian's breath caught, panic stiffening her limbs as she tried to push him away. His lips crashed against hers, insistent and demanding, his tongue sweeping past her defenses with relentless hunger.

Her resistance only seemed to spur him on.

"Not here," she managed, her voice muffled against his mouth.

To Vivian, the piano wasn't just an instrument—it was a connection to her grandfather, a symbol of his legacy. The thought of tainting it with this moment made her stomach twist.

Adrian pulled back just enough to meet her gaze, his eyes dark and burning. "You agreed to this," he reminded her, voice rough with need.

Before she could argue, he scooped her into his arms effortlessly, leaving no room for protest. He carried her to her bedroom.

The room was simple but warm, shelves lined with vintage book posters and the bed dressed in floral sheets that smelled faintly of lavender.

Adrian set her down gently, his body hovering over hers. She stared up at him, eyes wide with nervous energy, lips slightly parted as she struggled to steady her breathing.

In the soft light, her vulnerability shimmered—fear and reluctant anticipation making her all the more irresistible.

Her thoughts raced. How had they gotten here? How had things escalated so quickly? Yet the idea of stopping now felt like a lie.


###Chapter 261

Adrian's lips lingered against hers, a slow deliberate dance before he murmured, "Vivian... are you frightened?"

Her breath hitched.

Did it truly matter if this happened once or a hundred times now? Her eyes traced the sharp contours of his face - every chiseled angle, every perfect curve.

He was devastatingly handsome, the kind that made her pulse race against her will.

Memories of their first time surfaced, blurred by pain and exhaustion rather than passion.

After the divorce, he would belong to Serena.

That much was inevitable.

But the thought of leaving him spent and empty, incapable of giving himself to another woman, tasted like sweet revenge.

Was this acceptance or mere justification? She couldn't tell, but she released her inhibitions, her mind yielding to the moment as her body took control.

Tentatively, she raised her arms to encircle his neck, pressing shy kisses against his lips. Her movements were uncertain, inexperienced, barely grazing his mouth.

Adrian exhaled a soft chuckle, tilting her chin with firm yet gentle fingers. "Open for me," he commanded in a velvet whisper.

She complied, parting her lips as he claimed her mouth completely.

Their tongues tangled in a heated dance, the kiss deepening until her lungs burned for air.

When his teeth grazed her tongue, she jolted, a startled gasp escaping her.

Her wide vulnerable eyes met his amused gaze, only fueling his desire.

His hands slid to her waist, undressing her with practiced efficiency.

His lips blazed a trail down her neck, each kiss igniting her skin like wildfire.

The clasp of her bra gave way beneath his skilled fingers, her breath catching as cool air met bare skin.

He lowered his head, capturing one peak in his mouth, swirling his tongue in slow torturous circles.

Vivian arched instinctively, a soft moan escaping despite her embarrassment.

Her reactions spurred him on, his teeth grazing sensitive flesh until she trembled beneath him.

When he finally stripped her completely, only a fragile lace barrier remained.

She lay exposed beneath him, chest heaving as she struggled to regain her breath.

Adrian, still impeccably dressed, pulled back slightly.

His hungry gaze raked over her with barely restrained desire.

The contrast between them couldn't have been starker.

Every button of his crisp shirt remained fastened, every fold of his tailored trousers perfectly in place.
###Chapter 262

Vivian looked like a seductive goddess in contrast—bare, alluring, completely vulnerable to his every whim.

Adrian's fingers worked the buttons of his dress shirt with agonizing slowness, his burning gaze never wavering from her flushed face.

Flushing crimson, Vivian snatched a plush pillow from the bed, pressing it against her chest like a flimsy shield.

His strong hands lifted her thighs with surprising tenderness, his touch both commanding and worshipful.

With deliberate precision, he removed the final obstacle between them, letting the silken fabric whisper to the floor. He stilled, drinking in the sight of her with a hunger that made her skin prickle with awareness.

She writhed beneath his scorching appraisal, the compromising position making her feel deliciously exposed.

Mortified, she fumbled for the pillow again, clutching it like a lifeline.

But when she peeked over the cushion's edge, she caught the faintest smirk playing at his lips.

Indignation flared through her embarrassment.

She tossed the pillow aside and glared at him defiantly.

To Adrian, her fiery resistance only stoked his desire higher.

He leaned down until his warm breath caressed her ear, his voice a dark whisper. "Say my name."

Vivian bit her lip, torn between stubborn pride and the liquid heat pooling in her core.

Her traitorous body responded instantly, pulse racing as his lips traced the sensitive column of her throat.

"Adrian..." The name escaped in a breathless sigh, barely audible.

Something primal flashed in his darkened eyes. In one fluid motion, he lifted her hips and claimed her, his movements measured and devastatingly thorough.

At first, she tensed—shy, uncertain—but his relentless rhythm soon melted her resistance into molten surrender.

Every sensation burned brighter than before, no longer dulled by distractions.

Each touch, each thrust built upon the last until she shattered completely beneath him.

Her cries grew ragged, soft whimpers transforming into uninhibited moans as he drove her higher, leaving no room for thought—only sensation.

He was inexhaustible, pushing her through wave after wave of pleasure until she collapsed against the sheets, trembling with spent ecstasy.

She barely registered Adrian drawing the satin covers over her spent form.

Her eyelids grew impossibly heavy as she drifted into dreams filled with phantom touches and stolen kisses that made her heart race anew.

Hours later, still half-asleep, Vivian felt warm fingers tracing the dip of her waist.

The featherlight touch seemed part of her dreams until those clever fingers dipped lower, drawing a startled gasp from her lips.

Her eyes flew open to meet Adrian's smoldering gaze, the morning sunlight gilding his tousled hair in gold.

The sheets slipped as he leaned in, his intent clear in the predatory gleam of his eyes.

Her breath hitched.

The game had only just begun.
###Chapter 263

The morning light filtered through the curtains as Vivian stirred awake. Adrian's weight shifted beside her, his body pressing her deeper into the mattress.

A discreet knock echoed from the living area.

Vivian placed trembling hands against his bare chest. "Shouldn't you be leaving for your meeting?" Her throat felt raw from last night's passion.

Heat flooded her cheeks as fragmented memories surfaced - tangled sheets, whispered promises, his mouth tracing patterns across her skin.

Adrian's low chuckle vibrated against her collarbone. "The markets won't collapse if I'm late," he murmured, nuzzling her neck.

Her pulse quickened beneath his lips.

She squirmed, attempting to create space between their bodies. "We can... pick this up later," she breathed, her voice unsteady.

Adrian tilted his head, studying her flushed face. "Is that a promise?" His fingers traced idle circles along her hipbone.

Another knock interrupted them. Ethan's voice carried through the door. "Mr. Blackwood? Mrs. Hartley? I've brought breakfast."

Vivian's eyes widened in alarm. Seizing Adrian's momentary distraction, she scrambled from the bed and snatched up a tracksuit draped over the armchair.

She dressed with frantic efficiency, avoiding Adrian's amused gaze as she bolted toward the bathroom.

Adrian watched her retreat with a smirk, stretching leisurely before beginning to dress with deliberate slowness.

Ethan entered cautiously, balancing several gourmet takeout bags. The moment he crossed the threshold, an inexplicable chill ran down his spine. He looked up to find Adrian's piercing stare fixed upon him - that inscrutable, razor-sharp gaze that always made subordinates question their life choices. Had he miscalculated the timing? Ethan mentally reviewed his morning routine, searching for errors.

After arranging the food containers neatly, Ethan checked his watch. Exactly 8:00 AM - precisely when Mr. Blackwood had specified.

Adrian emerged from the bedroom, his shirt sleeves rolled to reveal corded forearms. He radiated effortless authority as he remarked, "I believe I instructed you to wait at the service entrance?"

Ethan straightened his tie. "Considering you skipped dinner, I thought an early breakfast might be prudent." His tone remained deferential despite the subtle correction.

Their attention shifted to Vivian, who burst from the bathroom still brushing her teeth. She performed her morning ablutions with military precision - rinsing, washing, and drying her face in under sixty seconds.

Without ceremony, she tore into the nearest food container, extracting a flaky pastry. She took an enormous bite, cheeks puffing like a chipmunk's.

Adrian leaned against the wall, arms crossed, watching her with undisguised amusement. The way she devoured her food with single-minded focus was oddly endearing.

"Mmm." Adrian acknowledged Ethan's explanation absently, reaching out to brush Vivian's cheek. She dodged instinctively but not fast enough - his fingers caught the edge of her jaw, coming away damp with cleanser residue.

"Missed a spot," he remarked, showing her the evidence.

Vivian scowled, swatting at his hand while still chewing.

Adrian's lips curved as he watched her struggle to simultaneously eat and maintain her dignity. The morning sunlight caught in her disheveled hair, turning the strands to molten gold. For all her protestations, she'd never looked more beautiful to him - sleep-rumpled, makeup-free, and utterly real.

Ethan discreetly averted his gaze, suddenly finding the wallpaper pattern fascinating. Some moments weren't meant for witnesses.
###Chapter 264

Vivian narrowed her eyes, suspicion flickering in her gaze. Was this just another one of his games? Adrian had an uncanny ability to push her buttons with those subtle provocations.

"Oh, thanks," she mumbled, too famished to dwell on it. Her stomach growled as she turned back to the food. After last night's ordeal, every cell in her body screamed for nourishment.

Adrian withdrew his hand silently, disappearing into the bathroom without another word. Ethan observed the exchange with relief. "Mr. Blackwood, I'll wait by the alley entrance," he offered, eager to make his escape.

Vivian barely registered his departure. She dug through the paper bag, uncovering more breakfast treasures. Her gaze drifted toward the bathroom where Adrian stood brushing his teeth with meticulous precision, as if time meant nothing. How could he not be starving? He hadn't eaten since yesterday evening, yet showed no signs of hunger.

When Adrian finally emerged, he settled at the dining table, flipping open his laptop with practiced ease. His fingers danced across the keyboard between sips of rich, aromatic coffee that mingled with the scent of warm pastries.

Vivian tilted her head, curiosity getting the better of her. "Not hungry?"

Adrian glanced up, his expression unreadable. "Contrary to popular belief, I do require sustenance."

She arched an eyebrow. "Then why are you drinking coffee instead of eating?"

He paused, the ghost of a smirk playing on his lips. "Concerned about my wellbeing?"

Vivian rolled her eyes dramatically. "Starve for all I care."

Rising abruptly, she crossed to the sofa to retrieve a small keychain. Removing a single key, she slid it across the table toward him. "Spare key. I'm visiting my alma mater today. No idea when I'll be back."

"Dinner tonight," Adrian stated without looking up from his screen, fingers still typing an email response.

"Pass," she replied automatically.

Catching her reflection in the mirror, Vivian's eyes widened at the visible marks still decorating her neck and collarbone. With an exasperated sigh, she rummaged through her suitcase for a turtleneck sweater. Shouldering her bag, she slipped her phone inside and headed for the door.

Adrian cleared his throat pointedly - a sound that somehow managed to be both subtle and commanding. She turned halfway, meeting his expectant gaze that clearly demanded proper farewell. Instead, she offered only a fleeting glance before shutting the door firmly behind her.

For a long moment, Adrian stared at the closed door. His fingers tapped an absent rhythm against the tabletop as one thought circled his mind: Pretending nothing happened. What exactly did this woman take him for?

Outside, Vivian descended the stairs just as Clarissa arrived on her electric scooter. The woman spotted her immediately, coming to an abrupt stop. Clarissa's critical gaze swept over Vivian's simple athletic wear and makeup-free face. She prided herself on being the town's fashion icon, having spent hours this morning perfecting her appearance in hopes of encountering the owner of that luxury car she'd seen yesterday.

Her tailored wool suit - costing a month's salary - was meant to impress. Yet standing beside Vivian's effortless elegance in understated sportswear, Clarissa's efforts suddenly felt garish. Vivian's natural beauty outshone her meticulously applied makeup, stoking the flames of Clarissa's jealousy.

Clarissa's lips curled into a sneer as she took in Vivian's outfit. "Heard you married some rich tycoon and were handing out gifts yesterday. Yet here you are - still no sense of style. Not a single designer label in sight."

Vivian glanced down at her clothes from Seabreeze Villa - custom-made pieces designed for comfort and quiet luxury. Though lacking visible logos, their quality surpassed any mass-produced designer item.
###Chapter 265

Vivian arched an eyebrow, her voice dripping with cool amusement. "Darling, my cheekbones are worth more than your entire designer collection."

Clarissa's face twisted in irritation. She opened her mouth to fire back when a wicked idea suddenly lit up her eyes, making her lips curl into a smug smile.

Her gaze raked over Vivian with undisguised contempt. "Vivian Hartley, always acting like you're too good for this world. Tell me, what self-respecting billionaire would ever look twice at someone like you?"

Vivian's laughter rang out, light and unbothered. "Oh sweetheart, are we taking dating advice from someone whose last three relationships ended with restraining orders?"

"At least I have options!" Clarissa snapped, tossing her chemically-treated hair. "I've always been the popular one - since kindergarten. And mark my words, I'll marry into money that would make your head spin." The words came out sharper than intended, revealing more insecurity than confidence. Her manicured nails dug into her palms as she desperately clung to her fading superiority.

Vivian merely smirked. "Do send me an invitation to the wedding. I do love a good comedy." With that, she turned on her heel, the click of her Louboutins echoing louder than any insult.

Clarissa's jaw clenched so tight her veneers threatened to crack. The dismissal stung more than any direct attack ever could. Frustration bubbled up until she stomped her Jimmy Choo-clad foot like a petulant child.

At the curb, Ethan stood waiting beside the matte black Bentley, casually sipping from a water bottle. Spotting Vivian's approach, he immediately set it down on the leather seat and straightened his tie. "Mrs. Blackwood, may I offer you a ride?"

Vivian waved him off with a graceful flick of her wrist. "Don't trouble yourself, Ethan. The café is just around the corner."

Ethan hesitated, then reached into the car's mini-fridge. "At least take some water. The street vendors' bottles are questionable at best." He extended a crystal-clear bottle of Voss toward her.

Vivian's gaze flickered between the artesian water in Ethan's hand and the generic plastic bottle he'd been drinking from moments before. A knowing smile played on her lips. "Actually, I'll take the San Pellegrino. The citrus notes pair better with my mood."

Without missing a beat, Ethan swapped bottles. Vivian accepted it with perfectly manicured fingers, twisting the cap with effortless elegance before taking a slow, deliberate sip.

Just then, Clarissa burst through the building's doors - and froze. Her Botoxed forehead actually managed to crease in shock as she took in the scene: Vivian chatting casually with a devastatingly handsome man in a tailored Tom Ford suit, standing beside a car that cost more than her parents' house.

Her mind reeled. Was this...? Could this possibly be Vivian's husband? The man behind the mysterious luxury car she'd been fantasizing about all morning?

Acid-green jealousy surged through Clarissa's veins. Her grip tightened around her knockoff Birkin until the cheap leather squeaked in protest. How? How did Vivian Hartley - the scholarship case with the dead mother and absentee father - end up with someone like this? While she, Clarissa Thornton, with her perfect upbringing and socialite training, was still swiping right on mediocre trust fund babies?

She'd had everything - private schools, debutante balls, a nose job at sixteen. Sure, Vivian had those ridiculous natural cheekbones, but Clarissa had worked hard for her looks. Weekly facials, monthly fillers, annual laser treatments. She'd invested in her appearance like it was a stock portfolio.

Yet here stood Vivian, looking effortlessly chic in off-the-rack Zara, being handed designer water by what appeared to be her personal driver-slash-bodyguard. The injustice burned like cheap tequila.

Then Clarissa noticed something peculiar. Vivian wasn't getting into the car.

The realization hit her like a champagne cork to the forehead. This wasn't Vivian's husband. This was... help. Hired help.

A slow, vindictive smile spread across Clarissa's face as she adjusted her posture, preparing to strike. The game wasn't over yet. Not by a long shot.
###Chapter 266

Vivian turned on her heel and walked away without a backward glance. Clarissa froze mid-step, confusion clouding her features. Had she been wrong about Vivian's connection to that man?

Her bewilderment deepened as she watched Ethan retrieve a water bottle from the driver's seat and take a long sip. The bottle looked identical to the one Vivian had just been drinking from. From her vantage point, she couldn't see that Vivian had taken hers along. The matching bottles made her assume it was the same one. That brief flicker of hope died as quickly as it had sparked.

"Excuse me."

The deep baritone voice behind her sent an unexpected shiver down her spine, rich and velvety like aged whiskey. Her pulse quickened as she twisted the scooter's handlebars forward, then glanced back over her shoulder.

The sight stole her breath. How could such perfection exist in human form? The man was breathtaking—towering with razor-sharp features, exuding power with every stride. His magazine-cover face and commanding presence demanded attention without effort.

Clarissa's knees nearly gave way when she realized he was heading straight for the luxury car. Her jaw dropped as the man by the vehicle straightened instantly, offering a respectful nod before opening the door. The stranger moved with effortless grace, every motion radiating quiet authority.

She stood rooted to the spot, watching numbly as the man entered the car and drove away.

Only when the taillights disappeared did she snap out of her daze, heart still racing. The realization hit her like a thunderbolt—the true owner of that car wasn't Vivian's husband. It was him.

That godlike man she'd just seen—the embodiment of every fantasy she'd ever had—was clearly the boss. Vivian's husband was nothing more than the chauffeur!

Giddy excitement bubbled up inside her. A delighted laugh escaped before she could stop it, drawing curious glances from passersby. If Vivian was married to just the driver, then the path was wide open for her to pursue the real prize. Once she became Mrs. Blackwood, she'd be the one giving orders. Vivian and her lowly driver husband wouldn't dare meet her eyes.

The thought filled her with delicious anticipation. Fueled by ambition, Clarissa twisted the scooter's throttle and sped off in the direction the car had gone. "Destiny favors the bold," she whispered to herself.

Willowbrook High School.

Vivian stepped through the familiar gates of her alma mater. As she entered the administration office, one of the teachers recognized her immediately, breaking into a warm smile. "Vivian Hartley! What a wonderful surprise!" The school buzzed with activity, senior students rushing between classes, keeping teachers and curious students constantly occupied.

A teacher quickly ushered Vivian forward, presenting her proudly to the gathered students. "Everyone, this is Vivian Hartley—a true role model for all of you." Though Vivian had completed her final year at Crestwood, her legacy at Willowbrook remained untarnished.

Her academic achievements were the stuff of local legend—perfect standardized test scores, top percentile university entrance results, and an unprecedented literature exam score that still stood as the school record.

Nearly ten years since her graduation, and no one had come close to breaking her records.

Several boys in the group straightened noticeably when they saw her. They'd heard stories about the beautiful genius, but seeing her in person was something else entirely.
###Chapter 267

The faded school ID photo in the display case showed a softer, more youthful version of Vivian Hartley - rounder cheeks, untamed hair tucked behind ears, crisp uniform collar perfectly pressed. Now she stood before them like a vision, her beauty so striking it seemed almost otherworldly, as if she'd stepped out of some romantic fantasy.

Her warm hazel eyes held a depth of kindness that instantly captivated everyone in the room.

The teenage boys shuffled their feet awkwardly, cheeks flushing pink when she smiled at them. None dared meet her gaze directly for more than a second.

"Thank you for your generous donation, Mr. Montclair—" The principal's voice carried through the hall as he entered with his guest.

Vivian looked up sharply at the familiar voice. "Julian?"

There stood Julian Montclair in his signature crisp white shirt, the sleeves rolled up to reveal strong forearms. His easy smile radiated warmth that immediately put the entire room at ease.

Vivian remembered Julian mentioning growing up in Crestwood, but she'd never connected him to the schools in Willowbrook.

The principal glanced between them curiously. "Vivian, Mr. Montclair, you know each other?"

Julian turned to Vivian. "After I accompanied you to visit your mother's grave last year, I learned about the hardships you and your grandmother endured. It inspired me to start supporting schools here." He added with quiet sincerity, "I couldn't change your past, but perhaps I can help others facing similar struggles."

Sunlight streamed through the windows as Vivian felt her heart swell with unexpected emotion. Even back in their university days, Julian had always been the type to help quietly without seeking recognition.

The principal beamed. "We have Vivian to thank for Mr. Montclair's continued support all these years." The teachers nudged the gathered students forward. "Come now, show your appreciation to your inspiration."

The students who'd benefited from the scholarship program bowed deeply in unison. "Thank you!"

Touched by their gesture, Vivian shook her head modestly. "All credit goes to Mr. Montclair. I merely made the introduction."

The students then turned to Julian with equal reverence. "Thank you, sir."

Julian waved off their gratitude. "Seeing you all pursue your dreams is thanks enough." He gave an encouraging squeeze to the shoulder of the nearest student.

As Vivian prepared to leave, Julian smoothly interjected, "I can give you a ride."

She opened her mouth to decline when he leaned closer, whispering conspiratorially, "Help me escape the principal's inevitable dinner invitation? You know I can't hold my liquor."

Trapped between amusement and obligation, Vivian sighed. "Fine."

Outside, as they approached his sleek black Bentley, Vivian suddenly remembered something. "Were you at the cemetery yesterday?"

Julian unlocked the car doors. "I usually handle donations remotely, but since I was in Crestwood, I thought I'd pay my respects to your mother and check on the students." His lips quirked in that familiar half-smile. "Had to make sure my money wasn't funding juvenile delinquency."

Vivian swallowed her prepared polite response at his unexpected humor. Oblivious to her internal struggle, Julian held the car door open with old-fashioned courtesy. "After you."
###Chapter 268

The evening air was crisp as Vivian stepped out of the school gates. The streetlights cast long shadows on the pavement, and the distant hum of traffic filled the silence.

“No need,” she said, shaking her head at Adrian’s offer. “I live close by, and the alley’s too narrow for your car. I’ll walk.”

Before she could finish, her phone buzzed—an unknown number flashing on the screen. She held up a finger to Adrian. “One moment,” she murmured, stepping aside to answer.

“Hello?”

“Vivian, you have to help Clarissa!” The voice on the other end was frantic, a middle-aged woman’s trembling plea.

Vivian listened, piecing together the story through the woman’s panicked rambling. Clarissa had crashed into Adrian’s car, and the argument had spiraled out of control, landing them both in police custody. The woman’s voice cracked. “Please, Vivian, don’t let your husband send my daughter to jail!”

“Relax, it’s not that serious,” Vivian reassured her, her tone steady. “It’s just a misunderstanding. I’ll be there soon.”

She ended the call, turning back to where Adrian stood, his expression unreadable in the dim light. The schoolyard was eerily quiet, the only sound the distant echo of her conversation.

Adrian swung the passenger door open again. “Get in. The station’s too far to walk.”

Vivian hesitated. Another refusal might seem like she had something to hide. Finally, she nodded, slipping her phone into her pocket before sliding into the car.

When they arrived at the police station, Ethan was waiting at the entrance. “Mrs. Blackwood—”

His greeting faltered as his eyes landed on Julian, standing just behind Vivian. Suspicion flickered in his gaze.

Vivian noticed and quickly explained, “I ran into an old friend at the school. He gave me a ride.”

Ethan’s skepticism didn’t fade. “Mr. Montclair was at Willowbrook High?”

Vivian’s patience snapped. “Ethan, are you interrogating me? Julian had his own reasons for being there. Do I need to justify every detail of my acquaintances’ lives to you?”

Ethan dipped his head in apology. “My apologies, Mrs. Blackwood.”

“That was out of line.” A cold voice cut through the tension. Adrian stepped forward from the doorway, hands tucked casually in his pockets. His gaze flickered between Vivian’s irritated expression and Julian’s composed stance. “But as your husband, don’t I have the right to ask about your friends?”

Their eyes locked—Adrian’s sharp and possessive, Julian’s steady and unreadable. After a beat, Julian turned back to Vivian, his voice soft. “I should go. Let me know if you need anything.”

“Thanks. Drive safe,” Vivian replied, her tone warmer than before.

Adrian’s jaw tightened. He moved closer, draping an arm around Vivian’s shoulders with a possessive edge. “Sweetheart, your neighbor’s still waiting inside.”

Though he spoke to her, his eyes never left Julian, his stare challenging. Julian met it for a moment, then turned and walked away without another word.

Adrian’s fingers lingered on Vivian’s shoulder as he guided her forward, his voice laced with mocking amusement. “An old friend, huh? You—”

Vivian shrugged him off, putting distance between them. “We’re almost divorced, Adrian. Remember your place—you’re nearly my ex, not my husband. I’m an adult. I don’t need you questioning my choices.”

Adrian’s expression darkened, but before he could retort, Vivian strode past him, heading into the station without another glance.

The tension between them crackled in the air, unresolved.
###Chapter 269

Vivian had chosen not to voice these thoughts in Julian's presence earlier, both to protect Adrian's dignity and to avoid any potential misunderstandings with Julian.

Julian had always treated her with kindness. She valued their friendship deeply and hoped it would last forever. Allowing herself to entertain deeper emotions was something she simply couldn't handle. With a swift turn, she walked back inside.

Ethan observed the storm clouds gathering on Adrian's face before cautiously suggesting, "Mr. Blackwood, Mrs. Blackwood responds better to gentle persuasion. A softer approach might help convey your concerns more effectively."

Adrian shot Ethan an icy sideways glance. "I won't stand by while those opportunists take advantage of her."

Watching the Bentley disappear down the driveway, Ethan murmured, "Perhaps you should tell her the truth about the Montclair family."

"We'll see," Adrian replied, hesitation coloring his tone. "If I speak now, it'll only look like I'm trying to sabotage her friendship out of petty jealousy. Besides, Julian helped her recently. I can't risk turning her against someone who came to her rescue. If the media gets wind of this, it'll spark another scandal."

After a brief pause, Adrian commanded, "Keep close tabs on Julian. Make sure he understands his boundaries. Vivian isn't someone he can play with."

Ethan was momentarily stunned. Why did Mr. Blackwood have to be so infuriatingly distant? It was obvious he'd carefully considered every move for Vivian's benefit, yet his words carried such sharp edges.

A guilty thought crossed Ethan's mind—maybe a divorce wouldn't be the worst outcome. If Adrian had to win his wife back, it might finally cure his relentless pride. The idea made Ethan wince with guilt. He quickly buried the thought; this was for Adrian's own good. Sometimes the bitterest medicine was the most effective cure.

"The bottle was sealed earlier! I offered her a Fillico first, but she insisted on Evian, so I got one. The bottle I drank from is still in the car—completely untouched!"

He spoke so rapidly it seemed he might produce surveillance footage any second to prove his innocence. But Adrian didn't even blink, responding with a single indifferent, "Hmm."

Seeing Adrian's calm demeanor, Ethan exhaled in relief. His boss wasn't one to fall for baseless accusations, especially not from an unstable woman desperate to save face.

Meanwhile, Meredith grabbed Clarissa's arm and pulled her aside, hissing sharply, "What kind of nonsense are you spouting? Everyone saw Vivian return with her husband yesterday! They're clearly happy together." Hoping to redirect attention, Meredith turned back to Vivian, adopting a pleading tone. "Vivian, you heard the young man—it was just a moment of panic! The truck startled her. Besides, isn't the car insured? Surely insurance can cover some of it? A few million...that's more than we could earn in a lifetime! If we're forced to pay, it'll destroy us!"

Ethan hesitated, glancing toward Adrian. "Well—" But before he could finish, Adrian's cold voice cut through the tension like a blade. "This isn't about the money."

Adrian's piercing gaze locked onto Vivian. "She did it because she wants your husband. She was trying to engineer some dramatic encounter, hoping it would lead somewhere. If we let this slide, what's to stop every other woman from trying the same stunt? Do you think I have time to visit the police station daily to deal with this kind of nonsense?"

Clarissa's face paled. For someone accustomed to admiration and attention, having her scheme exposed by the very man she desired was a humiliation beyond bearing. Her lips trembled as she lowered her head, wishing the ground would swallow her whole.
###Chapter 270

Care So Little About Me

Vivian stepped into the corridor, her gaze immediately landing on Clarissa and her mother Meredith, sitting rigidly on the bench like discarded porcelain figures. Clarissa, who had always carried herself with such elegance, now looked like a broken doll—her perfectly styled hair tangled and wild, her designer clothes smeared with dirt.

Meredith's face lit up when she spotted Vivian. She sprang to her feet, desperation lacing her voice. "Vivian, please speak to your husband. Clarissa never meant any harm! These mountain roads are dangerous—accidents happen all the time!"

Adrian and Ethan entered the hallway. Ethan stepped forward, his voice clipped and professional. "Mrs. Dawson, this was no accident. She deliberately swerved into our vehicle. When that truck approached, she panicked and accelerated, shattering our side mirror and leaving a deep scratch along the entire length of the car. The custom paintwork and interior detailing can't be repaired locally—the car will need to be shipped overseas for restoration."

Clarissa's vacant expression suddenly sharpened. She jumped up, cutting Ethan off with a trembling voice. "Mrs. Dawson? Isn't she your wife? Didn't you share a water bottle with her?" The words tumbled out, revealing her shock at discovering Vivian's connection to Adrian.

Clarissa stared at Adrian, whose handsome face was dark with anger yet still breathtakingly perfect—like some celestial being. How could someone like him be married to plain Vivian?

Ethan turned deathly pale, sweat beading on his forehead. "Miss, you can't just make accusations like that!" he blurted, stumbling over his words. "I never shared anything with Mrs. Blackwood!"

He turned to Adrian quickly, rushing to explain. "Sir, I only handed Mrs—"

Meredith froze as realization struck her like lightning. She remembered how Clarissa had spent extra time getting ready that morning. She grabbed her daughter's arm repeatedly, her voice shaking with fury and despair. "How could you? Your father and I raised you with integrity—how did we end up with a daughter who covets another woman's husband? Look at yourself! Why would Vivian's husband ever choose you over her?"

Clarissa, humiliated and cornered, finally snapped. Tears streamed down her face as she screamed, "What's wrong with me? Are you even my real mother? I've always had more suitors than Vivian since we were kids! Why am I not good enough? Why can't he want me?"

Meredith recoiled at the outburst before retorting sharply, "It's not about suitors! People didn't pursue Vivian because they were intimidated by her! She was the top student, an academic legend! Who would dare approach her? Who could possibly measure up?"

Clarissa collapsed onto the bench, the weight of her mother's words crushing her fragile ego. The truth cut deeper than she ever imagined possible.

Meredith, still trembling, tried to compose herself. But it was Vivian who broke the silence first. Her voice was calm and measured. "Let the insurance handle it," she said to Adrian. "This happened here in Willowbrook—no one outside town will know, so there's no risk of copycats. And you have the resources to keep it quiet, don't you?"

Vivian then turned to Meredith, her tone softening. "Take Clarissa home, Meredith. It's over now."

Meredith sagged with relief, thanking Vivian profusely. She grabbed Clarissa's arm and dragged her away. Clarissa cast one last longing look at Adrian, her heart twisting with bitterness. She had dreamed of standing beside him, outshining Vivian. Now she was leaving in disgrace, the punchline of her own tragic joke.

Adrian didn't even glance in her direction.
###Chapter 271

Adrian's piercing stare remained locked on Vivian. "Do I truly mean nothing to you?" His voice was dangerously calm, each word measured like a blade being sharpened.

The moment the words left his lips, Adrian despised himself for voicing them. It felt like unleashing a storm of vulnerability he'd spent years suppressing. This wasn't him - the man who'd always mocked jealous tantrums now found himself craving even a flicker of possessiveness from her.

Vivian let out a bitter laugh. "That's rich coming from you. When you paraded Serena around like some trophy, humiliating me at every turn, your precious advice was to 'be the bigger person.' But now with Clarissa - that delusional stalker - suddenly it's proof I don't care? Listen to yourself!"

She was done swallowing her words. No more silent suffering. From this moment on, she'd speak her truth without restraint.

Adrian tugged at his collar, irritation flaring. "Why must you always drag Serena into this?"

It wasn't just her words that cut deep - it was the mirror they held up to his own hypocrisy. Control had always been his armor. Yet their marriage was spiraling into chaos, and he barely recognized the man he'd become.

Vivian met his gaze with an icy smirk. Of course. The mere mention of Serena's name and he jumped to defend her. Predictable.

Her mind flashed to last night, to the paradox that was Adrian Blackwood. How could one man's actions and emotions be so violently at odds?

She'd always believed intimacy should be an expression of love - something sacred born from mutual respect. Without that foundation, it was just primal instinct. Yet despite everything, the embers of her feelings still smoldered. At least she hadn't let passion - or foolish hope - cloud her judgment.

Adrian braced for her usual sharp retort, but silence stretched between them. When he finally glanced at her, she was watching him with a gaze so cold it could freeze fire. Their eyes locked for a charged moment before she deliberately looked away.

"It's handled. I have work to do." With a clipped instruction to Ethan, she turned and walked off without a backward glance.

Frustration erupted in Adrian. His foot connected with a nearby stool, sending it crashing against the wall. Ethan watched the scene unfold, his gaze darting between Vivian's retreating form and Adrian's thunderous expression. The assistant sighed internally. If Mr. Blackwood kept playing these games, he'd lose her for good.

Meanwhile, in an upscale Willowbrook neighborhood, Julian sat motionless on a leather sofa, his usual charm replaced by a terrifying stillness. His fingers tapped a rhythmic pattern on the armrest.

"Willowbrook has barely 300,000 residents," he said softly. "Yet after all this time, you still haven't located him?"

A portly man stood sweating before him, mopping his brow with a trembling handkerchief. "M-Mr. Montclair, we've checked every piano instructor, music store owner, even bar pianists - anyone remotely connected to-"

Julian's hand flashed out, sending a porcelain teacup shattering against the man's temple before he could finish.
###Chapter 272

"Idiot! Who told you he'd be earning his keep by playing piano? Have you been using that pathetic logic all this time? Is that why you keep disappointing me?"

The man flinched but remained still, taking the impact directly. The porcelain mug shattered against his forehead, scattering fragments across the marble floor. Crimson trails mixed with dark coffee dripped down his cheek as he mumbled incoherently, fear rendering his words unintelligible.

Julian leaned back in his leather chair, fingers forming a steeple beneath his chin as he contemplated his next move. "Search every residence with a piano. Investigate families who bought used ones—trace their origins precisely."

The man's expression brightened with sudden realization. "Genius as ever, Mr. Montclair!"

After an awkward pause, he ventured cautiously, "The resort recently tapped into the mountain hot springs. Perhaps you'd like to stay and recuperate for a few days?"

Julian hesitated, a melodic feminine laugh echoing in his memory. Against his usual judgment, he gave a noncommittal grunt. "Hmm."

The man beamed. "I'll prepare your private suite at once!"

Julian's gaze flickered to the blood still seeping from the man's temple, his face twisting in revulsion. "Clean yourself up. You're disgusting."

The man practically glowed with relief, bowing repeatedly as he backed out of the study.

Alone, Julian retrieved his phone. He opened WhatsApp, thumb hovering over the chat interface for an eternity before exiting without typing a single character.

Vivian wandered through the familiar streets of Willowbrook, noting how many childhood landmarks had vanished—replaced by glossy storefronts or boarded-up windows. She'd always imagined bringing Adrian here someday—walking these same cobblestones, sharing her favorite bakery's cinnamon rolls, pointing out where she'd scraped her knee learning to ride a bike.

Two years of marriage, yet this simple wish remained unfulfilled. Now that they were both in Willowbrook together, she'd hoped to finally bridge that gap, to smooth over the unspoken regrets between them. But everything had changed—especially them. Some fractures never truly healed, leaving only ghosts of what might have been.

Her feet carried her to the wrought-iron gates of her old elementary school. The candy shop that once sold licorice ropes for a quarter now boasted organic smoothies. She bought some street vendor's grilled skewers instead, the aroma transporting her back to after-school snacks. As the setting sun painted the brick buildings gold, memories of Emberglow County surfaced, and she turned toward Eleanor's apartment.

The moment Vivian opened the door, spicy aromas assaulted her senses—ginger, garlic, and something burning. To her astonishment, Adrian emerged from the kitchenette coughing violently, his face flushed scarlet beneath the ridiculous frilly apron tied around his waist. She froze in the doorway, certain he'd have retreated to the Harbor Grand after their explosive argument.

Yet here he stood—not just present, but attempting to cook. The apron should have looked absurd on his six-foot-two frame, but somehow the contrast between the domestic fabric and his sharp jawline worked. Sometimes it wasn't the garment that mattered, but the man wearing it. Without his usual tailored shirt, the apron's ties emphasized his narrow waist, the sight unexpectedly intimate amidst the steam and smoke.

When Adrian finally stopped choking, he glared at her with watery eyes, voice hoarse. "Water. Now."
###Chapter 273

Vivian snapped back to reality, her fingers curling around a chilled water bottle from the wall-mounted fridge. She extended it toward Adrian without a word.

He didn't accept it. His gaze flicked to the sparkling water on the coffee table. "I prefer that one."

"Whatever," Vivian huffed, thrusting the bottle against his chest before pivoting toward the shoe rack. Her ballet flats hit the hardwood with more force than necessary.

Adrian twisted the cap open, tilting his head back as he drained half the bottle in one continuous swallow. The column of his throat moved hypnotically, catching the dim kitchen light.

Vivian disappeared into her bedroom, the door clicking shut behind her.

Adrian stared at the closed door, tightening the cap with a frustrated twist. He'd cut short an underwhelming site inspection in Crestwood, checked into the Harbor Grand, yet couldn't shake this restless energy pulling him toward Vivian's apartment.

The apron strings dangled from his fingers when hesitation struck. Leaving now would reduce him to nothing more than a temporary chef in her eyes.

With a scowl, he tossed the apron aside and began plating the meal.

Changed into soft cotton loungewear, Vivian lingered on the edge of her bed. The door creaked open unexpectedly, revealing Adrian leaning against the frame. "Dinner's served. Should I bring it here?"

"I'll eat at the table," she said, rising with deliberate slowness.

The dining surface held three artfully arranged dishes beside a steaming bowl: Szechuan beef slices, truffle-infused mashed potatoes, chilled okra salad, and wild mushroom bisque. Vivian's breath caught. His disastrous first attempt at pasta had led her to underestimate his culinary skills—not realizing her barren pantry had been the real limitation. Ethan's grocery delivery had clearly unleashed Adrian's true abilities.

As she settled into her chair, Adrian nudged the beef toward her. "Ethan brought enough chili peppers to stock a restaurant. Had to use them up—they were cluttering the fridge." His tone carried forced nonchalance.

The moment the spicy beef touched her tongue, Vivian recognized the careful calibration of heat and tenderness. "This is incredible," she admitted freely.

A glimmer of satisfaction crossed Adrian's features as he sampled the potatoes. "The ingredients were frozen. Not ideal."

Vivian picked up one of her street food skewers, offering him a glistening sausage stick with a teasing smile. "Try it? From my favorite vendor near campus."

Adrian's nose wrinkled. "You still eat street food? The hygiene standards—"

She yanked the skewer back, taking an aggressive bite. "You devoured those tacos in Emberglow without complaint. Is it suddenly beneath the great Adrian Blackwood, or is it just me you look down on?"

His silverware clinked against the plate as he set it down. "That was different."

"How?" Vivian challenged, polishing off the remaining meat with deliberate relish.

Adrian's jaw tightened. "Foxfire Diner was... a place from my childhood. It matters to me."

The unspoken weight behind his words hung between them like the aromatic steam rising from their untouched soup.
###Chapter 274

Vivian stared at the barbecue skewers in her hand, childhood memories flooding back with each bite. The nostalgia made her reluctant to argue. Their divorce was imminent anyway—soon Serena would be the one dealing with Adrian's dietary preferences.

"Did the site inspection go well?" she changed the subject. "Any investment potential in Willowbrook?"

If Adrian decided to invest in her hometown, his financial influence could transform the local economy. Business talk always calmed him. "The natural hot springs are Willowbrook's main asset. But Crystalpeak already dominates the market, and other locations aren't prime real estate. The ROI wouldn't justify heavy investment."

Though Willowbrook had numerous thermal springs, none had achieved national recognition. During Vivian's college years, a wealthy investor had leased the largest mountain with hot springs, constructing a luxury resort that briefly earned the title "nation's finest thermal retreat." But the project stalled when the investor lost interest.

"Why not acquire Crystalpeak Resort?" Vivian suggested. "It would be a guaranteed success."

With Ambermyst airing—starring Katrina and Sebastian—and the recent social media buzz, the drama was destined to be a hit. Sapphire Springs, where the protagonists fell in love, had already boosted tourism in Emberglow County, and surrounding areas stood to benefit from the show's popularity.

Plus, Damien planned a Christmas release—peak season for hot spring getaways.

"I considered that," Adrian admitted. "Offered above market value, but they're refusing to sell."

Vivian nibbled her lower lip. "The owner clearly lacks business sense yet clings to the property. Probably holding out for a better offer."

Adrian hesitated before revealing, "Ethan mentioned the executives believe the owner is searching for someone. They're determined to stay put—selling isn't an option."

"Willowbrook has barely half a million residents. If they haven't found this person after all these years..." Vivian trailed off, then added thoughtfully, "Actually, I've never visited Crystalpeak."

"Never?" Adrian's eyebrows shot up.

Resting her chin in one hand, Vivian absently pushed food around her plate with the other. "They built it after I left for college. Only came back during holidays and never stayed long enough to visit."

Adrian set down his fork, studying her profile. "The deal didn't close today, but the resort manager gave me complimentary passes—full access to the hot springs with overnight accommodation. Interested?"

"Absolutely!" Vivian immediately reached for her phone to call Audrey.

Before Vivian could speak, Audrey's抱怨came through the line. "This town is deader than last season's fashion! How did you survive growing up here? I wanted to visit Crystalpeak tomorrow but everything's booked solid."

After letting her friend vent, Vivian casually offered, "Adrian has some passes. Want to join us?"

An ear-piercing squeal followed. "Oh my god, you're an angel!"
###Chapter 275

The phone slipped from Vivian's ear with a soft click. "Alright then, we'll meet at the resort tomorrow."

Adrian stood frozen, watching helplessly as their romantic getaway morphed into a group excursion before his eyes.

Crystalpeak Hot Springs Resort - Next Day

Perched on the mountainside like a hidden jewel, Crystalpeak Resort offered the perfect escape. One side catered to lively public pools filled with vacationers, while the other boasted five exclusive villas, each with private thermal springs where guests could soak undisturbed in steaming mineral waters.

Vivian and her friends had secured one of these luxurious villas. When she arrived with Adrian, Dominic and Audrey were already pacing impatiently at the villa entrance.

Audrey practically pounced the moment Vivian stepped from the car, her lips forming an exaggerated pout. "I didn't pack a swimsuit when we left Crestwood! The resort shop has nothing but hideous floral monstrosities - I'd rather stay in my room playing video games than be seen in those!"

Ethan was already unloading their luggage. Vivian grabbed several shopping bags and handed them to Audrey with a knowing smirk. "Ethan thought ahead. These are all new swimwear and toiletries - take your pick."

Audrey's eyes sparkled as she peeked inside, immediately spotting designer labels. "These are this season's runway pieces!" She clutched the bags like precious treasure. "You absolute angel! I'm changing right now!"

Before anyone could respond, Audrey had vanished inside in a whirlwind of excitement.

"Women and their fashion," Dominic sighed, shaking his head as he turned to Adrian. "Hey mate, got any spare swim trunks I could borrow?"

Adrian's glacial stare could have frozen lava. Without speaking, he snatched a bag from Ethan and shoved it at Dominic before striding inside, his silence more cutting than any words.

Dominic blinked in confusion. "What's crawled up his trousers?" he muttered to Vivian.

Vivian merely shrugged, her tone airy. "Oh, don't mind him - he's just being dramatic today."

She followed Adrian inside, leaving Dominic scratching his head. He turned to Ethan for explanation, but the assistant merely adjusted his wire-rimmed glasses. "Mr. Sinclair, hot springs are traditionally... a couples' activity."

Dominic frowned. "But isn't it more fun with friends? Drinking, playing cards, telling stories?"

Ethan suppressed a sigh. The man was about as perceptive as a brick wall. Without responding, he gathered the remaining bags and disappeared inside.

Left standing alone, Dominic huffed. "Why's everyone in such a hurry?" he grumbled before following.

Inside, the group quickly changed. Adrian and Dominic emerged first in plush robes over their swimwear. Moments later, Vivian and Audrey appeared, their hair pinned up and similarly dressed in resort robes.

###Chapter 276

Dominic Sinclair crushed his half-smoked cigarette against the ashtray and rose with an exaggerated sigh. "Took you ladies long enough!" Audrey Winslow shot him a glare sharp enough to slice through steel. "If you can't say something pleasant, maybe keep that pretty mouth shut."

Ethan Caldwell had stayed back at Seabreeze Villa to handle some urgent work, leaving the remaining four to explore the private hot springs of Crystalpeak Resort. These weren't just ordinary hot springs - they were the epitome of luxury. The courtyard alone housed eight different pools, each offering unique experiences: champagne baths, therapeutic mineral soaks, rose petal pools, and more.

Audrey grabbed Vivian Hartley's wrist with childlike excitement. "We're starting with the champagne pool!" Adrian Blackwood and Dominic followed at a leisurely pace, already loosening their silk robes.

As the men shrugged off their robes, their sculpted physiques were revealed - broad shoulders tapering to narrow waists, abdominal muscles so defined they could've been chiseled from marble.

Audrey's gaze lingered on Adrian's swim trunks, and she elbowed Vivian with a mischievous grin. "Damn girl, you really won the genetic lottery!"

Dominic caught the implication and immediately adjusted his own swimwear defensively. "Excuse me? I'm not exactly lacking in that department either! These trunks just don't fit right!"

Adrian's eyes flicked toward Vivian, only to find her gaze curiously assessing Dominic. His reaction was instantaneous - without warning, he delivered a sharp kick that sent Dominic tumbling into the pool.

The splash was spectacular. Dominic surfaced moments later, sputtering and wiping water from his face just as Audrey and Vivian were slipping out of their robes.

Audrey had chosen a violet bikini that perfectly matched her headband. Normally exuding sultry confidence, the swimsuit gave her an unexpectedly sweet, almost innocent charm - a tantalizing contradiction.

Dominic's jaw went slack. But when he turned, his gaze followed Adrian's and landed on Vivian.

Vivian wore a white one-piece with daring cutouts at the waist and back, covered by a sheer wrap that hinted at more than it revealed. Her long legs bore only faint traces of past scars, giving her an ethereal quality of both fragility and strength.

The pool sat near the courtyard's edge. Two men passing by couldn't resist peering through the slats in the fence.

Vivian and Audrey were busy taking selfies by the pool's edge.

One man stroked his chin appreciatively. "That one in violet? She's got something special."

His companion disagreed. "You're blind. The other one's a goddess. Those curves could start wars."

Adrian's expression darkened dangerously, his gaze locking onto the intruders.

Dominic stormed from the pool, water dripping from his chiseled frame as he marched toward the fence. "Get lost! This is private property!"

The men turned their attention to Dominic, one raising an eyebrow. "Who's this pretty boy? You got no idea who you're talking to."

The second man whistled loudly, calling out, "Hey ladies, ditch these losers. We'll show you a real good time."


###Chapter 277

Vivian's face twisted in revulsion as she snatched the robes, tossing one to Audrey before hastily wrapping herself in the other. Her eyes tracked Adrian's determined stride toward the side gate, his path cutting directly toward the two leering men.

Before the offenders could react, Adrian's foot connected with the whistler's ribs, sending him sprawling backward.

Dominic followed with a brutal right hook to the second man's jaw, the impact dropping him like a sack of potatoes. He punctuated the assault with several sharp kicks to the fallen man's side.

"You vermin dare disrespect women in Adrian Blackwood's presence?" Dominic sneered.

The groaning men clutched their injuries, their threats weak through bloodied lips. "You'll pay for this! Do you know who we answer to? We'll ruin you!" Their words slurred together, still dazed from the pain.

Their eyes suddenly brightened at the approach of a heavyset figure. Scrambling to their feet like eager puppies, they cried, "Mr. Pembroke!"

Rushing to their apparent savior, they jabbed accusing fingers at Adrian. "Sir, these animals attacked us completely unprovoked!"

Mr. Pembroke followed their gestures, his confident expression faltering when he recognized Adrian. Just yesterday, the young tycoon had expressed interest in acquiring Crystalpeak Hot Springs - the crown jewel of Willowbrook's tourism industry. While several parties had shown interest, Adrian's offer had been conservative, leading Pembroke to dismiss him as just another trust fund kid playing businessman.

The injured men were crucial suppliers for his resort. In resource-scarce Willowbrook, reliable vendors were worth their weight in gold.

Decision made, Pembroke straightened his tie and approached.

"Mr. Blackwood," he began with false politeness, "I extended complimentary passes for your enjoyment, not for you to assault my valued business partners."

The suppliers nursed their wounds behind him - one rubbing his swollen jaw, the other clutching his ribs. "We're filing charges," one spat. "Medical reports don't lie."

Dominic barked a laugh. "Complimentary? Adrian could buy this entire resort with pocket change."

Pembroke's lips curled. "Many in Crestwood could afford Crystalpeak. Your offer yesterday was... underwhelming."

Adrian's glacial sidelong glance made the older man shiver. The Blackwood Group's meteoric rise wasn't built on frivolous spending, but strategic investments. That piercing gaze held more authority than Pembroke had seen in executives twice Adrian's age.

Vivian stepped forward, her voice arctic. "By all means, call the authorities. We'll gladly explain how these pigs harassed women."

Audrey crossed her arms beside her. "Disgusting old perverts. When was the last time you looked in a mirror?"
###Chapter 278

A quick assessment showed the two men had predatory gazes that made the women's skin crawl. Both Vivian and Audrey were already wrapped modestly in their robes.

"Vivian?" A familiar voice called softly from behind.

She turned to see Julian Montclair approaching in crisp white athletic wear, his breathing steady from his morning run.

Her brows lifted in surprise. "Julian? What are you doing here?"

He nodded politely at Audrey before explaining, "I'm the primary investor. Whenever business brings me to Willowbrook, I stay at this resort." He gestured toward the misty mountains. "The fresh air makes for perfect running conditions."

Vivian absorbed this revelation silently. That Julian owned Crystalpeak Hot Springs was unexpected.

She hesitated, torn between confronting the creeps and avoiding potential backlash for Julian. In today's digital age, even justified actions could be twisted into viral scandals.

Audrey didn't hesitate. "Julian, these disgusting men harassed us, and Mr. Pembroke here tried calling the police on us instead of them."

Realizing Julian knew Vivian, Mr. Pembroke began sweating profusely. His eyes darted nervously as he stammered, "It was these two who started the altercation and assaulted our vendors—"

The battered men limped forward. One pointed to his swollen face from Dominic's punch. "Look what he did to me!"

Audrey smirked. "Honestly? That might be an improvement."

Julian's expression turned icy as he addressed Mr. Pembroke. "Have these two taken to the station."

The manager initially nodded before realizing Julian meant the suppliers, not Adrian's group. He swallowed hard. "They're Willowbrook's largest suppliers. Replacing them last minute would—"

"Then I'll find someone who can," Julian interrupted coldly, as if discussing the weather.

"Right away, sir!" Mr. Pembroke fumbled for his radio, beads of sweat forming. "Security to Courtyard Three immediately!"

The men paled. Rumors about Crystalpeak's mysterious owner being connected to the Blackwood family in Crestwood suddenly made sense. They dropped to their knees. "Mr. Montclair, we didn't know these ladies were with you. Please forgive us!"

Vivian's glare could freeze lava. "So women without powerful connections are fair game?" Audrey added sharply, "Run background checks. I'd bet my designer bag they've done this before."

Julian's piercing gaze locked onto Mr. Pembroke. "You heard them?"

"Yes, absolutely!" The manager bobbed his head frantically. "We'll investigate thoroughly."
###Chapter 279

Seeing no hope in pleading with Julian, the two men turned their desperate eyes to Mr. Pembroke. "Mr. Pembroke, have mercy! We've always taken good care of you—"

Their veiled reference to bribes made the manager pale. He shoved them violently. "Shut your filthy mouths! Don't you dare implicate me!"

Security arrived just as the words left his lips. Mr. Pembroke pointed with trembling fingers. "Remove these troublemakers immediately."

Within moments, the men were dragged away, leaving only the sound of Mr. Pembroke's labored breathing in the tense silence.

As the manager scurried after the detainees, Adrian remained standing with his group. Dominic nudged him, murmuring, "Doesn't this Montclair fellow seem overly invested in your wife?"

Audrey stepped forward, gratitude shining in her eyes. "Julian, we're deeply indebted to you for your assistance today."

Dominic pulled her back roughly, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "Why the theatrics? Adrian and I had everything under control before this white knight showed up."

Audrey glared at him. "Must you always be so boorish? Common decency demands we thank someone who helped us!"

Adrian said nothing, his glacial stare locked onto Julian. The two men stood motionless, tension crackling between them like static.

Finally, Adrian spoke, his voice deceptively calm. "Shall we talk?"

Vivian instinctively moved between them, her voice urgent. "Adrian, don't." Turning to Julian, she pleaded, "Please, just go."

Julian gave her shoulder a reassuring squeeze. "It's alright, Vivian. Mr. Blackwood and I are old acquaintances. We simply need to... reconnect."

Opportunity For—

Julian led Adrian to a secluded alcove beneath the cherry blossoms. Adrian lit a cigarette with deliberate slowness, exhaling smoke before speaking. "Stay away from Vivian."

"She's not your property. You don't get to dictate her relationships." Julian's usual warmth vanished, replaced by a coldness matching Adrian's own.

"Relationships?" Adrian's laugh was dry as the smoke curling from his lips. "You're barely family."

Leaning against the tree, Julian smirked. "Funny how you disowned that connection the moment you took control of Blackwood Group."

Adrian's voice dropped dangerously. "Your choices have consequences. Hers don't. If you care for her at all, you'll walk away."

"I'd die for her. Unlike you, I don't have some manipulative ghost haunting my conscience. The damage you've done could cost her years of happiness."

Julian's tongue pressed against his palate, his lazy half-smile never reaching his eyes. The two men stood locked in silent combat, neither willing to yield an inch.

###Chapter 280

The crisp mountain air hung heavy with tension, the only sound being the whispering pines swaying in the breeze. After what felt like an eternity, Adrian was the first to break eye contact, tossing his spent cigarette into the snow with practiced indifference. "Stop dwelling on impossible scenarios."

Julian arched one perfectly sculpted eyebrow. "Is that friendly advice or a veiled warning?"

"Interpret it however you like," Adrian countered, already turning on his heel to leave without another word.

When he returned to the private courtyard intending to suggest their departure, the scene before him made the words die in his throat. Vivian and Audrey, wrapped in plush white robes, were laughing like schoolgirls as they dangled their feet in the steaming mineral waters.

Vivian noticed him first, tilting her head in that curious way she had. "What were you and Julian discussing for so long?"

"Just corporate matters," Adrian replied with deliberate casualness, though his jaw tightened imperceptibly.

Assuming it was merely business negotiations between powerful men, Vivian didn't probe further. Instead, she asked, "How do you two know each other anyway?"

Internally, she marveled at this revelation. Adrian had known Julian for years - further proof of the Montclair heir's substantial influence. Yet she couldn't recall any Blackwood family connections to the Montclairs.

Adrian's usually controlled voice carried an edge of irritation. "Our paths crossed years ago. We're hardly close."

Why this sudden fascination with Julian? She even addressed him with such familiarity, as if they shared some intimate history. An unfamiliar tightness coiled in Adrian's chest, though he'd never admit it was jealousy.

Dominic, ever the instigator, shot Adrian a mischievous grin. "What's this? Is the great Adrian Blackwood actually jealous?"

Audrey rolled her eyes before cutting in sharply, "Why would he be? They're practically divorced already."

Dominic's expression turned comically alarmed as he subtly tugged at Audrey's sleeve. She jerked away with a scoff. "What? Suddenly we're censoring the truth now?"

Adrian ignored Audrey entirely, instead fixing Dominic with a glare that could freeze lava. If looks could kill, Dominic would've been vaporized on the spot.

"Couples fight," Dominic offered weakly, rubbing the back of his neck. "They're not actually going through with the divorce, right?"

Audrey planted her hands on her hips. "Please. That precious Lise has practically moved into Blackwood Manor already."

"You really think they can all play happy family under one roof?"

The atmosphere turned suffocating. Vivian, unwilling to drag her friend deeper into this mess, was about to change the subject when a staff member approached with a polite bow.

"Mr. Pembroke has arranged for the entire resort to be at your private disposal. All other guests have been discreetly relocated."

Audrey tapped her chin thoughtfully. "In case any staff wander by, let's move to the indoor pool. A movie and some champagne in the water sounds perfect right now."

The suggestion was met with unanimous approval.

Meanwhile, in the resort's main villa, Mr. Pembroke sat wringing his hands, his normally composed demeanor fraying at the edges. The same staff member returned to find him pacing anxiously. "Sir? Is everything alright?"

###Chapter 281

The man was Mr. Pembroke's most trusted aide, renowned for his razor-sharp intellect and uncanny ability to read situations.

Mr. Pembroke exhaled heavily, his shoulders slumping. "I've made a grave miscalculation today. Mr. Montclair might have me dismissed by morning. Back in Crestwood, I was just another errand boy, but this position was supposed to be my big break. The salary alone was triple what I earned before. Today's blunder could cost me everything."

His assistant attempted to console him. "You've already evacuated the premises, and the families you relocated hold significant sway in Willowbrook. I doubt Mr. Montclair will remain angry for long."

A disbelieving laugh escaped Mr. Pembroke's lips. "In all my years, I've never seen Mr—"

"Montclair show such devotion to any woman. I made some discreet inquiries. They say he walked away from a billion-sterling deal without hesitation, all because of her."

The assistant's eyes gleamed with sudden inspiration. "Mr. Pembroke, perhaps this isn't a disaster, but rather... an opportunity?"

"What sort of opportunity?" Mr. Pembroke's voice held cautious hope.

Leaning in conspiratorially, the assistant lowered his voice. "If Mr. Montclair is this infatuated, why not arrange for the woman to be sent directly to his chambers? Turn your mistake into an act of service. He might reward you handsomely for such... consideration."

Inside Seabreeze Villa, Adrian reclined in the steaming mineral pool, his muscular arms resting along the stone edge. Dominic sat beside him, fingers flying across his gaming console with the intensity of a general commanding troops. Every button press echoed through the tranquil space like miniature explosions.

Audrey discreetly raised her phone, capturing a candid shot of Vivian leaning against the pool's mosaic tiles. The faint shutter sound made Adrian's eyelids flicker momentarily.

Vivian's skin glowed pink from the heat. Beads of water traced mesmerizing paths—starting at her temples, cascading down her jawline, following the elegant curve of her neck, before disappearing beneath the shimmering surface. Each droplet's journey seemed deliberately sensual, designed to torment.

Memories assaulted Adrian—visions of Vivian beneath him, those same water droplets replaced by sweat, her lips parted in ecstasy. The recollection sent heat pooling low in his abdomen. He clenched his jaw, forcing his eyes shut and his thoughts toward business matters.

Unaware of Adrian's heated gaze, Audrey tucked her phone away with flushed cheeks. "That's it, I'm done!" she announced, scrambling from the water. "I can't take another minute of this sauna. Honestly, I can barely breathe!"

Dominic, having just defeated his digital nemesis, set aside the console with a triumphant smirk. "Pathetic stamina. We've been soaking what—twenty minutes? And you're already surrendering?"

Audrey turned to Vivian for support. "Do you hear how he talks? Absolutely no tact whatsoever!"

Dominic stretched lazily, his grin widening. "Just calling it like I see it."

"Four of us here, and you're the only one turning into a cooked lobster. Admit it—you're embarrassingly out of shape." With theatrical flair, he flexed his arms, water cascading from his defined biceps. "Unlike yours truly. These bad boys? Pure Crystalpeak Range endurance. Could hike those trails backward and still have energy to spare."

Audrey's eye roll could have powered a small turbine. "Congratulations. You've officially become a walking gym advertisement."

Vivian rose gracefully, stretching her limbs. "Actually, I'm starting to feel it too. This heat is more intense than I expected." Her damp hair clung to her shoulders as she moved toward the steps.

###Chapter 282

Adrian remained silent, his eyes closed in deliberate indifference. The tension in the air was palpable.

Dominic wisely swallowed his next remark when he noticed Vivian's stiff posture. Picking a fight with two people when Adrian clearly wouldn't back him up? Not worth it. He exhaled sharply through his nose.

Emerging from the pool, he wrapped a plush robe around himself and sauntered toward the sofa. "I'm starving. We've got groceries. Who's cooking?"

Audrey sprawled dramatically across the cushions. "Do I look like your personal chef? Make it yourself."

"I never said—"

The ringing house phone cut through their bickering.

Dominic answered to hear a polite staff member's voice. "Good evening, Mr. Sinclair. We're offering an exclusive buffet service in the restaurant beneath your Seabreeze Villa. The space has been reserved solely for your party, and our executive chef is prepared to craft any dishes you desire."

"Excellent." Dominic's face lit up with smug satisfaction as he hung up. He shot Audrey a triumphant look. "See? The universe provides. Think of food, and dinner appears."

In the private dining room

The group arrived freshly showered and changed, only to be assaulted by the pungent aroma of chili peppers. The table groaned under the weight of fiery dishes—spicy lobster, Szechuan chicken, and an array of tongue-numbing specialties that promised tears.

Dominic wrinkled his nose. "Can we get some milder options? This is practically inedible."

Adrian's gaze flickered briefly toward Vivian.

Audrey, never one for subtlety, gasped dramatically. "Viv! These are all your favorites!" She linked arms with her friend, eyes sparkling with mischief. "Your mysterious admirer must have arranged this."

Noticing the storm clouds gathering in Adrian's expression, Dominic quickly interjected. "Enough standing around. I could eat a horse. Let's sit."

They took their seats beneath Adrian's simmering glare.

Vivian selected a fork and passed another to Audrey. A plate of chili-glazed beef strips shimmered before her. She took a careful bite. "It's... decent."

Adrian speared a piece, tasted it, then deposited it in the discard bowl with a look of utter disdain. "Overcooked. Chewy. The spices didn't penetrate properly." His critique dripped with contempt.

Only then did Vivian remember the exquisite version of this dish Adrian had prepared in their home kitchen. Sensing his growing irritation, she sought to diffuse the tension.

Meeting his stormy gaze, she offered softly, "Yours was definitely better." It wasn't empty flattery—Adrian excelled at everything he put his mind to, cooking included.

###Chapter 283

Adrian's stern expression softened slightly as he turned to the waiter. "A bottle of sparkling water, please."

"Adrian, how could you—" Dominic started, but was immediately silenced by Adrian's icy glare.

Audrey raised her hand with a bright smile. "I'll have mango juice."

"Same here," Dominic chimed in, flashing a grin.

She rolled her eyes dramatically. "Really? Copying my order now?"

"Copying? Hardly. I just happen to love mangoes," Dominic countered, leaning back in his chair.

Vivian massaged her temples. These two could turn even the simplest conversation into a battlefield.

The waiter turned to her expectantly. "And for you, Miss?"

"Iced Americano," she replied calmly.

She caught Adrian giving her an unreadable look before the waiter quietly retreated to place their orders.

The vibration of her phone shattered the momentary silence. The screen displayed a message from Ivory Phoenix Productions: "Are you available right now?" The unusually formal tone from her normally direct contact made her pause. Vivian quickly typed back, "I'm on holiday in my hometown. The script will be delivered as soon as I return—it won't affect the schedule."

"There are some complications on our end. Please hold off on completing the script for now."

"What kind of complications?" Vivian frowned. Her scripts always met expectations when given clear direction. This vague response hinted at deeper trouble.

The reply took painfully long to arrive: "We're still finalizing details with the client. We'll update you when we know more."

Vivian's frown deepened. Everything had been progressing smoothly until this sudden roadblock. The promise of easy earnings seemed to be evaporating like morning dew.

Before she could dwell further, Audrey slapped a hand over her phone. "Why are you glued to your screen when we're supposed to be enjoying ourselves? You're sucking all the fun out of this gathering!"

"Alright, alright," Vivian surrendered, locking her phone and tucking it away. "The client's being difficult. Hopefully they won't demand rewrites. Besides filming, I've got several events lined up." She clasped her hands in mock prayer.

Audrey shot Adrian a pointed look. "You've got more money than you could spend in three lifetimes, yet you're letting Vivian struggle after the divorce? She's working herself to the bone with filming and still needs side gigs to pay bills?"

Dominic, who'd been lounging with one leg crossed over the other, nearly toppled from his chair. He righted himself hastily, beads of sweat forming on his forehead. "Eat your food," he urged, piling more onto Audrey's plate with his fork.

Audrey pushed the plate away in disgust. "What am I, your pet pig? How am I supposed to eat with this mountain of food?" She glared at Dominic before turning back to Adrian. "What's really going on here? What aren't you telling us? He's been parading around with Serena, which—let's be honest—is practically emotional infidelity! He's the one at fault here. It's already generous not to demand half his assets. Why should Vivian walk away with nothing? She's being gracious by staying quiet, but you're just taking advantage. Isn't that just bullying?"

Adrian, who had just retrieved a cigarette, slowly set it back down. His response came measured and cold: "First, I never mentioned divorce, nor did I agree when she brought it up. Second, I've never withheld anything from her. If she chooses to earn her own money, she must accept the challenges that come with it. Adults don't get to make choices without accepting the consequences."

Vivian remained unfazed by his clinical tone. He spoke less like a husband and more like a CEO analyzing a corporate merger—his words precise, logical, and utterly devoid of warmth. Her emotional reserves for him had long since run dry.
###Chapter 284

Vivian responded with measured composure, "Mr. Blackwood is correct. I chose this path, so I'll handle both the rewards and consequences that follow."

Adrian drummed his fingers against the polished mahogany table, releasing a humorless laugh. Her agreement unsettled him more than their usual heated exchanges ever could.

Yet her flawless rebuttal left no opening for counterattack. It was like swinging at mist - his frustration only grew as his arguments dissipated into nothingness.

As the tension between them dissolved into uncomfortable silence, a server approached bearing a silver tray of beverages. With practiced precision, he placed each drink before them, finally setting a sparkling soda in front of Vivian. "Miss Hartley, this is our signature house blend. The carbonation fades quickly, so I recommend enjoying it immediately."

Though she hadn't planned to drink it right away, the server's insistence prompted Vivian to take a small sip. The man watched her throat move as she swallowed before adding, "Do finish it while it's still at its best." He departed with an odd gleam in his eye that neither noticed.

Unaware of the exchange, Audrey suddenly reached for Vivian's half-empty glass. "Let me taste this miracle drink," she declared, parched from the salty appetizers. In one swift motion, she drained the remaining soda.

Moonlight silvered the landscape as evening deepened. Audrey rubbed her temples with a groan. "Why am I so tired suddenly? Was it the food or the thermal baths?"

Her head felt unnaturally heavy, as if she'd consumed several glasses of wine. Vivian nodded in agreement, her own eyelids drooping. "I feel it too. Perhaps we should retire for the night."

Audrey stood abruptly, shedding her jacket after only a few steps. "Why is it so warm up here? Mountain nights are supposed to be chilly."

Dominic emerged from the restaurant, pulling his coat tighter with visible discomfort. "Are you joking? It's freezing out here," he countered, shooting her a puzzled look.

Audrey ignored him, scanning their surroundings. The lush forest that had seemed so inviting by daylight now appeared ominous beneath the moon's pale glow. Shadows from swaying branches created eerie patterns that set her nerves on edge.

She clutched Vivian's arm tightly. "Let's hurry back. This place is giving me chills."

Dominic smirked. "So the fearless Audrey has a weak stomach after all. Paper tiger."

Without hesitation, Audrey aimed a kick at his shins. "Missed me!" Dominic taunted as he dodged, only to stumble backward into Adrian who had been following silently.

Adrian shoved him aside with visible distaste. "Move."

Audrey flashed a triumphant grin at Dominic before striding ahead with Vivian. The two men followed at a more measured pace.

The night sky glittered with countless stars while soft lanterns illuminated the stone pathway. Crickets chirped rhythmically from the trees, their song mingling with the earthy forest scents. Vivian barely registered the serene beauty, her head growing heavier with each step. Audrey's weight against her shoulder only intensified her exhaustion. She longed to simply collapse onto the cool stones and surrender to sleep.

Adrian noticed her faltering steps and closed the distance between them, his brow furrowing. "Are you unwell?"

"Just overate, probably," Vivian murmured, waving off his concern with sluggish fingers.

###Chapter 285

Adrian didn't wait for Vivian's response before sweeping her into his arms, pushing Audrey aside with his shoulder. The sudden movement made Audrey stumble, her high heels wobbling dangerously on the marble steps.

"Audrey!" Vivian gasped, reaching out instinctively toward her best friend.

Dominic was there in an instant, steadying Audrey with firm hands. "Careful now," he murmured, his grip gentle but secure.

Vivian withdrew her hand and glared at Adrian. "A little warning would've been nice! She could've been seriously hurt!"

"You can hardly keep yourself upright," Adrian countered sharply, adjusting Vivian effortlessly in his arms as he descended the stairs. "How exactly were you planning to catch her?"

The abrupt motion startled Vivian, and she instinctively wrapped her arms tighter around Adrian's neck, afraid he might drop her. She didn't see the faint, satisfied smirk that flickered across his lips at her reaction.

Within moments, Adrian had outpaced Dominic and Audrey, leaving them several flights behind.

Audrey dramatically collapsed onto the steps, fanning herself. "That's it. I'm officially done walking. You'll have to carry me now, Dom."

Dominic gave her an exasperated look. "If you weighed as much as Vivian, I might consider it—"

"Excuse you!" Audrey smacked his arm indignantly. "This isn't fat—it's curves! Glorious, womanly curves!"

A uniformed attendant approached with a practiced smile. "Miss, our luxury spa is currently offering complimentary aromatherapy sessions for first-time guests. Would you like to experience it?"

Audrey's eyes lit up like a child's on Christmas morning. "Hell yes! Take me there immediately!"

The attendant's gaze darted around briefly. "Will anyone be accompanying you, Miss?"

Audrey rolled her eyes dramatically. "Oh for—yes, there's another one. She's back at the villa having some 'quality time' with Mr. Tall-Dark-and-Annoying. Why all the questions?"

Dominic raised an eyebrow. "You drank three espresso martinis before dinner. No wonder you're hiccuping."

The attendant's expression shifted subtly, her smile widening. "Espresso martinis? You've been drinking coffee-based cocktails, Miss?"

Audrey narrowed her eyes suspiciously. "What, is caffeine banned at your precious spa or something?"

"Not at all," the attendant assured quickly, though her eyes gleamed strangely. "It's just that caffeine can sometimes cause hiccups. I'll prepare some ginger tea to help settle your stomach."

"I'll come with you," Dominic interjected, his protective instincts kicking in.

The attendant maintained her professional smile. "I'm afraid this is a ladies-only facility, sir. But don't worry—we'll ensure Miss Winslow returns safely to Seabreeze Villa after her treatment."

Audrey was already linking arms with the attendant. "Lead the way, spa goddess!"

Dominic frowned. "It's getting late. Why not wait until morning? You know how you get in unfamiliar places after dark. Don't expect me to come rescue you later."

The attendant's voice was honey-smooth. "We have full security measures, sir. Your friend will be perfectly safe with us."

Audrey waved dismissively over her shoulder as the attendant led her away. "Relax, Dom! I'm a big girl!"

Dominic watched them go, unease coiling in his gut. Something about the attendant's overly eager demeanor set off alarm bells in his mind.
###Chapter 286

"I'll pamper myself with a spa day while I'm there!" Audrey declared, dismissing his concern with a flick of her wrist.

With a determined grip, she pulled the attendant along. "Tell me everything about your signature treatments. I want the full experience."

Dominic remained rooted in place, watching her retreating figure until it vanished around the corner. After a brief pause, he exhaled sharply and turned back toward Seabreeze Villa.

He knelt on the sofa, his fingers working deftly at the buttons of her blouse.

Vivian found herself momentarily lost in the heat of his touch.

But a quick glance around the room snapped her back to awareness. "Adrian, wait!"

He misinterpreted her hesitation as playful resistance.

His hand slid beneath the waistband of her skirt, encountering undeniable evidence of her arousal.

His skilled fingers traced circles against her most sensitive spot as he leaned in, his voice husky. "Tell me you don't want this."

Vivian's breath came in shallow gasps, her chest rising and falling rapidly.

She suppressed a moan, her voice barely audible. "Not here..."

Her eyes darted toward the entrance. "Audrey and Dominic could return any minute..."

Adrian paused briefly before withdrawing.

Reaching above her, he activated the smart lock system with a decisive press.

The electronic chime signaled their privacy as he murmured, "Relax. No one's interrupting us now." Vivian attempted to sit up, her momentary clarity breaking through the haze.

The movement brought her lips dangerously close to his belt buckle.

His masculine scent - warm with hints of sandalwood - permeated the fabric, making her pulse quicken.

Adrian stilled for a heartbeat before swiftly undoing his belt.

Once freed, his arousal became impossible to ignore.

His voice dropped to a rough whisper. "Show me what that pretty mouth can do."

This was Vivian's first proper look at him fully aroused, and the impressive size made her throat go dry.

Suddenly all those times she'd felt overwhelmed made perfect sense, leaving her both intrigued and slightly apprehensive.

He exhaled impatiently, his fingers threading through her hair to guide her closer.

Despite her inexperience, she didn't resist.

Earlier in Seabreeze Villa, Adrian had carried Vivian into the living room and deposited her gently on the plush sofa.

Yet even after setting her down, he remained hovering close, unwilling to break contact.

Vivian gazed up at him, her brow furrowing slightly in confusion.
###Chapter 287

Vivian's eyes shimmered with playful mischief, her gaze dancing over Adrian's face like sunlight on water.

Without warning, she closed the distance between them, her lips meeting his in a featherlight caress.

The contact lasted mere seconds - a tentative exploration that left her pulse racing.

She'd become surprisingly adept at reading his reactions, at knowing precisely how to provoke that delicious tension in his jaw.

Experience, it turned out, was the best teacher of all.

Where once she would have blushed and stammered, now she moved with newfound confidence.

That timid girl who'd first arrived in Crestwood seemed like a distant memory now.

Countless stolen moments had rewritten her body's responses, leaving her attuned to his every movement.

Adrian had been restraining himself since their interrupted encounter in the library.

But that whisper-soft kiss shattered his resolve completely.

His hand cradled her face as he deepened the kiss, his tongue claiming her mouth with possessive intensity.

Dizziness washed over her, a cocktail of oxygen deprivation and sheer desire.

Through half-lidded eyes, she caught the focused intensity of his expression - the slight furrow between his brows, the way his lashes fanned against his cheekbones.

He was utterly absorbed, every sense attuned to their connection.

Without conscious thought, Vivian matched his rhythm, their kiss evolving into a perfect give-and-take.

When Adrian finally broke away, his darkened eyes told her everything.

Emboldened, she took the lead, her actions drawing a ragged groan that vibrated through her entire body.

To her surprise, she found power in this role reversal - a heady rush of control she hadn't anticipated.

Fragments of movie scenes flickered through her mind, inspiring experimental techniques.

But soon her stamina began to flag, her movements growing sluggish with exhaustion.

Noticing her fatigue, Adrian lifted her effortlessly, divesting her of restrictive clothing before positioning her against the plush sofa.

There was no preamble this time - he sheathed himself in her welcoming heat with a single thrust.

Her body accepted him eagerly, as if designed for this exact connection.

The contrast of her disheveled blouse against bare skin drove him wild, each movement more urgent than the last.

Vivian's vision blurred, her consciousness narrowing to the exquisite friction between them.

The elegant updo she'd painstakingly created now hung in damp tendrils, clinging to her flushed neck and shoulders.


###Chapter 288

Vivian's cheeks flushed a deep crimson, more intense than the lingering heat of a tropical sunset. Breathless sighs escaped her parted lips, each one sending fresh waves of desire through Adrian's body.

Even after their passionate encounter, Adrian found himself drowning in temptation all over again.

She lay draped over the sofa's edge, her body pliant and relaxed in post-coital bliss. Every curve seemed sculpted just for his hands.

With practiced tenderness, he adjusted her position, ensuring her comfort. His fingertips traced invisible patterns along her spine as he moved her.

Kneeling before her, Adrian drank in the sight like a man starved. His gaze traveled over every inch of her exposed skin.

Her flawless complexion bore the evidence of their lovemaking - faint pink marks that made his pulse quicken. Each one a brand of possession.

A primal satisfaction surged through him. Like a master painter surveying his finest work, he admired the canvas of her body.

Vivian's drowsy eyes met his, and without hesitation, her delicate fingers wrapped around his growing arousal.

Adrian's breath hitched as she began stroking him with practiced movements. Within moments, he hardened completely beneath her touch.

He reached for her thighs, pulling her closer with gentle insistence. Her hips lifted in perfect synchronization, their bodies speaking a language of their own.

Their rhythm mirrored the ocean's tide - building intensity followed by gentle retreat, over and over in hypnotic repetition.

When the waves finally stilled, Adrian rose on unsteady legs. He gathered their discarded clothing before scooping Vivian into his arms.

Upstairs in the marble bathroom, he lowered her into the waiting tub. Warm water cascaded over her skin as he began his ministrations.

His soap-slicked hands moved with reverence, cleansing every inch of her. No part of her escaped his attentive care.

After carefully drying her with plush towels, Adrian reached for her lingerie. His breath caught at the sight of tender redness between her thighs.

Averting his gaze, he retrieved the special ointment from the medicine cabinet. Since Vivian's accident, he never traveled without a fully stocked first aid kit.

His touch was feather-light as he applied the healing balm. Even in sleep, her body responded instinctively - thighs clamping around his wrist.

The soft whimper that escaped her lips shattered his self-control. Desire, momentarily sated, roared back to life with terrifying intensity.

Unable to resist, Adrian delivered a playful swat to her backside. "My little siren," he murmured against her ear, voice thick with renewed hunger.
###Chapter 289

The silky ointment glistened on Vivian's skin as Adrian finished applying it with meticulous care. He slipped the delicate nightgown over her shoulders, the fabric whispering against her body like a lover's caress.

His strong arms guided her head onto his lap. His fingers wove through her damp tresses, each strand like liquid gold between his fingertips, still carrying the lingering fragrance of jasmine shampoo.

The hairdryer hummed softly as he worked, his touch tender yet precise. Vivian's breathing deepened, her chest rising and falling in perfect rhythm with the peaceful night.

Gone was the vibrant glow from earlier. In its place, a quiet vulnerability that made her beauty even more breathtaking. Her lips, slightly swollen from their passionate encounter, bore the faintest blush of pink.

After ensuring Vivian was comfortable, Adrian pressed a featherlight kiss to her forehead before disappearing into the ensuite bathroom.

Dominic strode down the hallway of Seabreeze Villa, his footsteps echoing against the marble floors. He paused at the locked door, hand hovering over the knob before withdrawing with a sigh. His thoughts were consumed by Audrey.

Turning on his heel, he retraced his steps. Normally, he wouldn't think twice about women visiting spas or nightclubs alone. But tonight, watching Audrey leave, an unfamiliar tightness gripped his chest.

The unease reminded him of that terrible night when Vivian had disappeared. He'd never seen Adrian so unhinged - the usually composed billionaire tearing through Crestwood like a man possessed.

In all their years of friendship, Adrian had always been the epitome of control. That night had shattered that image completely. Dominic finally understood - true understanding only came from walking similar paths.

Morning sunlight danced across Vivian's eyelids, coaxing her awake. She blinked against the golden rays, her gaze immediately drawn to the sculpted chest beneath her palm.

Her fingers twitched involuntarily, tracing the hard planes of muscle. A pang of regret shot through her - if their marriage ended, she'd lose access to this godlike perfection.

Her thoughts scattered when she met Adrian's amused gaze. He'd been watching her exploration with evident enjoyment.

Vivian refused to give him the satisfaction of seeing her flustered. With practiced nonchalance, she withdrew her hand and slipped from bed, her movements graceful despite the lingering soreness.

The bathroom mirror reflected the night's evidence - faint bruises blooming like violets across her skin. She sighed, reaching for her toothbrush, meeting her own tired reflection's gaze in the glass.

The minty paste foamed as she brushed, the rhythmic motion giving her mind space to wander. The events of last night played behind her eyes - Adrian's possessive touches, the way he'd worshipped every inch of her body.

A shiver ran down her spine at the memory. She spat into the sink, watching the white foam swirl down the drain like her swirling thoughts.

The shower turned on with a hiss, steam quickly fogging the mirrors. Vivian stepped under the scalding spray, letting the water wash away both the physical and emotional residue of their passionate night.

Her skin pinkened under the heat, the water droplets catching the morning light like liquid diamonds. She tilted her face upward, allowing the stream to massage her stiff muscles.

Outside, Adrian watched the bathroom door with hooded eyes. Last night had changed something between them - shifted some fundamental balance. And he intended to explore exactly what that meant.
###Chapter 290

The morning sunlight filtered through the sheer curtains as Vivian stood before the bathroom mirror, examining the faint marks on her neck. "Great," she muttered, pressing a finger to the sensitive skin. "Just slap on some concealer and pray the makeup holds through twelve hours of filming?"

Midway through brushing her teeth, a sudden realization struck her. She spat out the toothpaste, spun around, and nearly collided with Adrian's broad chest. Toothbrush still dangling from her lips, she took a hasty step back. "Did Dominic and Audrey come back last night?"

"I locked the door," Adrian replied casually, as if discussing the weather. He plucked the toothbrush from her hand, squeezed fresh toothpaste onto it, and began brushing with practiced ease. "They probably found other accommodations."

"You what?" Vivian's eyes widened. "Where exactly were they supposed to sleep?"

Adrian rinsed his mouth and shrugged. "They're grown adults, Vivian. With half the villas in Seabreeze vacant, I'm sure they managed." His infuriatingly calm logic left her speechless.

Dressed and ready, they descended the staircase. Vivian unlocked the front door while checking her phone, then froze at the sight of two familiar figures approaching. Audrey walked several paces behind Dominic, her usual confident stride replaced by something more hesitant.

As they drew closer, Vivian's sharp eyes caught the telltale mark on Audrey's neck - identical to the ones she'd been cursing in the mirror earlier. Her gaze flickered between Audrey's flushed cheeks and Dominic's unusually rumpled appearance. The pieces clicked together with almost audible finality.

"So that's how the cookie crumbles," Vivian thought. "One locked door, one long night, and Adrian's interference accidentally played matchmaker."

Some revelations, she decided, were best ignored. She schooled her features into careful neutrality.

Adrian's low voice broke the silence. "Let's pack up and get breakfast. I want to visit your mother's grave again before we leave."

Meanwhile, Audrey collapsed onto the living room sofa with dramatic flair. "The service here is absolutely atrocious! Last night I went for a spa treatment, and those incompetent staff dumped me at some deserted villa and vanished!"

She tossed her hair over one shoulder. "Thank heavens Julian showed up when he did. Who knows what might have happened otherwise?"

Adrian, who'd been adjusting his cufflinks, went perfectly still. The temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees. "You encountered Julian?" His voice could have frozen molten lava.

Audrey instinctively straightened, then deliberately exaggerated a sigh. "Oh yes, Julian was simply wonderful - so kind, so attentive. Though for some reason, he didn't seem thrilled to see me..." She trailed off with an artful pout, watching Adrian's reaction with barely concealed satisfaction.

But Adrian had already turned away, his fingers tightening imperceptibly around his cufflink. Clearly, Julian Montclair hadn't taken his warning seriously enough.

The morning air hummed with unspoken tensions as four very different people pretended everything was perfectly normal.
###Chapter 291

The night before had been a close call. Thank goodness Vivian hadn’t gone to the spa. Who knew what kind of disaster might have erupted?

One Hour Later

The group gathered their things and left Crystalpeak Hot Springs. Audrey, usually so carefree, was acting strangely. Just as everyone was about to get into their cars, she suddenly walked over to Adrian’s vehicle. "I’m riding with you guys," she declared.

Dominic shot her a brief glance but said nothing, heading to his own car and driving off without another word. "Adrian, I’m going back to the hotel to pack. I’ll return to Crestwood separately."

Audrey seemed oblivious, only turning to watch Dominic’s car disappear down the road. Vivian sensed the tension but chose not to pry into their personal drama.

The three of them stood awkwardly beside the car. The extra passenger wasn’t the problem—figuring out the seating arrangement was.

Adrian’s icy gaze landed on Audrey. "Sit in the front."

Audrey bristled. "Why don’t you sit up front? I want to talk to Vivian."

Vivian opened her mouth to intervene, but before she could speak, Adrian ignored them both and slid into the backseat without another word.

With a defeated sigh, Audrey yanked open the passenger door and climbed in.

As the car pulled away, Adrian scrolled through his phone, skimming headlines about the Fed cutting interest rates and loosening real estate restrictions in several cities.

His mind briefly wandered to Vivian. Maybe it was time to buy a few properties under her name.

In the front seat, Audrey fidgeted restlessly, turning her head every few seconds like she was dying to spill her thoughts about Dominic. But each time she caught sight of Adrian’s brooding expression in the rearview mirror, she swallowed her words and sank back into her seat.

Finally, she gave up and pulled out her phone. Without headphones, the thumping bass of DJ music filled the car.

Vivian leaned forward, curious. "What’s that noise? What are you watching?"

Audrey tilted her screen toward her. "Male dancers."

The video displayed a shirtless streamer gyrating under flashing lights, his exaggerated abs and chest flexing dramatically for the camera. The shadows made his physique look even more sculpted than it probably was.

Vivian’s gaze flickered to Adrian’s reflection in the mirror, then back to the screen. She couldn’t help but compare—and found herself slightly disappointed.

Just as she was about to look away, Adrian’s cold stare met hers.

He scoffed, his voice dripping with disdain. "Your taste is questionable."

The condescension stung. Vivian straightened, lifting her chin defiantly. "You old-school types wouldn’t understand the appeal of younger men. They’re sweet, energetic, and actually know how to have fun—something you might not be familiar with."

Audrey jumped in eagerly. "Exactly! And let’s not forget their stamina. Unlike some older guys, who probably can’t even—"

"Enough," Adrian cut in, his lips curling into a dangerous smirk as his eyes locked onto Vivian. There was a challenge in his gaze, sharp and unyielding. "Are you sure you’re talking about the right person?"


###Chapter 292

Vivian's cheeks burned scarlet as she was caught off guard. Her fingers nervously tapped against her phone screen. "The internet these days...you can access anything with just one click, can't you?"

Completely unaware of the tension she'd created, Audrey continued scrolling through her feed.

"Absolutely! Clubs aren't always convenient, but live-streamed male dancers? Available 24/7. And the best part? They take custom requests. Just tip a few hundred bucks and they'll perform exclusively for you."

The mention of spending money made Vivian freeze. Alarm bells rang loudly in her frugal mind. Wasting money was completely unacceptable.

"Spend money on that?" She leaned back in her leather seat, waving her hand dismissively. "That amount could buy me a whole crate of premium durians. Throwing cash at men? That's just inviting bad luck."

Adrian's lips twitched slightly, a ghost of approval flashing across his face before he returned to scrolling through financial news on his phone. Naturally, he didn't consider himself among the "men" she'd so casually dismissed. A man of his stature needed neither money nor approval from anyone.

Desperate to escape the awkward atmosphere, Vivian checked her notifications. A message from Julian appeared: "Update on our earlier issue. The account funding the online trolls is registered under Vincent Lockwood."

Her brow furrowed. The name tickled her memory but she couldn't immediately place it. She mentally flipped through her contacts, but Vincent's identity remained elusive.

Vivian opened her mouth to ask Audrey something, then abruptly closed it when she noticed Adrian still hovering nearby. She pressed her lips together, swallowing her words.

When it came to anything involving Serena, Adrian showed as much impartiality as the sun favoring one side of a mountain. If she dared investigate, he'd likely bury any evidence exposing Serena's misdeeds. Vivian knew that with Adrian involved, her search for truth would be as futile as trying to catch smoke with bare hands.

Her mind whirred as she calculated her next move, then she pulled out her phone to brainstorm a new screenplay idea. As Vivian Hartley the screenwriter, it felt like ages since she'd last written anything. Just as she was developing her protagonist's traits, the car came to a smooth stop.

Before she could look up, Audrey spun around with characteristic enthusiasm. "Darling, we're here! Out you go!"

Adrian's sleek black Bentley had drawn curious glances from passersby the moment it stopped. As Vivian stepped onto the pavement, she spotted the school principal approaching, arms laden with grocery bags. Recognition lit up his face when he saw her, and he hurried over with a broad smile.

"Vivian! Where have you and Mr. Montclair been off to today?" Taking in the luxury vehicle and recalling Julian's previous visit to the school, he naturally assumed they'd been together.

Hearing this, Adrian exited the car, his expression darkening like an approaching storm. He strode toward Vivian with deliberate steps, his piercing gaze sharp enough to cut glass. "And who might this be?" he asked in a voice like chilled steel.

With their impending divorce hanging over them, Vivian had no intention of letting Adrian become entangled with people from her personal life. She hesitated, scrambling for a way to redirect the conversation.

The principal, however, seemed to have an epiphany. "Ah! You must be Vivian's cousin, right? I believe we've met before. Your family has remarkable genes - both the men and women are exceptionally attractive."
###Chapter 293

Audrey, just stepping out of the car, let out an exaggerated sigh. "Vivian, isn't your cousin practically ancient by now?"

The principal opened his mouth to respond when his phone rang sharply. His wife's impatient voice crackled through. "Where are those groceries? Dinner's getting cold!"

"I'm on my way," he promised before turning to Vivian with an apologetic smile. "You really should join us for dinner sometime."

Vivian returned the smile warmly. "Go finish your cooking. I've got company here, so I won't intrude tonight, but I'll take a rain check."

With a quick nod, the principal hurried off.

Audrey nudged Vivian playfully. "I told you to find someone younger. Men expire faster than dairy products - past thirty, it's all wrinkles and dad bods."

She avoided Adrian's intense gaze, focusing instead on the cracked pavement beneath her feet.

Adrian, however, was no ordinary man. Though three years Vivian's senior, his chiseled features defied time. His presence carried the weight of battles fought and storms weathered, making him seem older than his years.

The air between them grew thick. Adrian's voice cut through the tension like ice. "Why didn't you correct him?"

Vivian met his glare with cool detachment. "What difference would it make? If I explain now, what do I say next time? That we're divorced?"

Adrian's dark eyes smoldered dangerously. After a long pause, his lips twisted into a mirthless smile. "Fine. We'll finalize the divorce as soon as we're back in Crestwood."

Without waiting for a response, he turned sharply, yanking open the car door. "Ethan, we're leaving."

Ethan hesitated, glancing between Adrian and Vivian. "Mrs. Blackwood—"

Adrian's voice turned glacial. "She's perfectly capable of taking care of herself. Don't interfere."

"But this town isn't exactly—" Ethan began before shrinking under Adrian's withering stare.

"Planning to stay here with her?" Adrian's question dripped with venom.

With an apologetic look at Vivian, Ethan slid into the driver's seat. The engine roared to life, tires screeching as the car disappeared down the road.

Audrey finally snapped out of her daze with a bitter laugh. "Men really do show their true colors after they get what they want."

Her eyes flickered to the faint marks on Vivian's neck, identical to her own. Vivian brushed off the implication and changed the subject. "What's going on between you and Dominic?"

At the mention of her own predicament, Audrey deflated like a punctured balloon. She rubbed her lower back with a wince. "What do you think? You saw us. We slept together."

She grimaced. "That man acted like he'd been stranded on a desert island. I'm still sore from his... enthusiasm."
###Chapter 294

Audrey's eyes flew open at Vivian's bold statement, her head swiveling instinctively to scan the deserted street. Though no prude herself, discussing such intimate matters at full volume on a public sidewalk felt like broadcasting her diary entries on national television.

With practiced efficiency, she grabbed Vivian's elbow and propelled her toward Eleanor's building. "For heaven's sake, keep it down! This isn't some public forum for your love life announcements."

"Sex is as natural as breathing," Vivian countered, lifting her chin defiantly. Yet despite her bravado, she did lower her voice marginally.

Vivian wasn't about to let this go. "Alright, out with it. Is this a proper relationship now, or just a one-time fling?"

A frustrated sigh escaped Vivian's lips as she worried the hem of her blouse. "Dominic wants commitment. I don't."

Vivian's eyebrows shot up. "Seriously? Five minutes ago you were railing about Adrian being emotionally unavailable. Now you're pulling the same stunt!"

"Guilty as charged," Vivian admitted with an unrepentant smirk, flopping back onto the sofa cushions. "But here's the thing - my family's already benefiting socially from our association with the Sinclairs. If Dominic and I actually dated? My parents would turn into stage parents overnight, expecting me to play the perfect society girlfriend."

Her hands clenched into tight fists. "I've spent years breaking free from their control. Fought tooth and nail to make my own choices, to keep my relationships mine - not some strategic alliance for their social climbing. If after all that struggle I end up right back under their thumb, what was the point?"

Her voice softened slightly. "This way's better. Enjoy the moment without the complications. Years from now, I can remember him fondly - no messy breakups, no regrets."

Vivian hesitated. "But...what if it turns out better than you expect? Isn't this approach a bit...cynical?"

Vivian shook her head firmly. "Not willing to take that gamble. Right now I'm still in control. But if we took that next step?" She gave a humorless laugh. "Love's like a wildfire - once it starts, good luck containing it."

Vivian couldn't help but admire her friend's brutal honesty, even as it saddened her. "What does Dominic think about all this?"

"Oh, he probably thinks I'm some heartless playgirl," Vivian said with an airy wave, her lips twisting into a sardonic smile. "The irony? He was my first. But if that's the narrative he wants to believe, fine by me. Last thing I need is some outdated notion of 'responsibility.' As if a woman's worth is measured by chastity in this day and age."

Meanwhile, at a luxury villa in Crystalpeak Hot Springs...

Julian sprawled across the buttery leather couch, his usual polished demeanor replaced by something far more dangerous. One ankle rested casually on the opposite knee, his free arm draped lazily over the sofa back. In his other hand, a sleek pistol spun in slow, deliberate circles.

###Chapter 295

A few yards away, Mr. Pembroke knelt on the polished marble, his body shaking violently like a fragile branch in a storm. Beads of sweat rolled down his flushed face as he stammered, "M-Mr. Montclair, I—"

Julian didn’t spare him a glance, his icy focus locked on the sleek pistol in his hand. With a soft, deliberate click, he disengaged the safety. His voice was eerily calm, yet laced with lethal precision. "Did I not make myself perfectly clear the last time we spoke?"

Terror flashed in Mr. Pembroke’s wide eyes, and he scrambled for words. "M-Mr. Montclair, it wasn’t my doing! My men—those fools—they assumed you had feelings for Ms. Hartley, so they—they slipped her a sedative. I never imagined someone else would take her place—"

Julian’s glacial gaze finally shifted to him, freezing the man mid-sentence. "So, in your twisted logic, affection justifies drugging someone?" His tone dripped with disgust. "Do I strike you as that pathetic?"

"N-No, never!" Mr. Pembroke’s voice cracked under the weight of fear. "I—I’ll deal with those idiots myself. Please, Mr. Montclair, spare me—"

"Montclair, I swear!"

Julian remained silent, his fingers lazily spinning the pistol. Mr. Pembroke watched, desperate for any sign of mercy, but Julian’s expression was unreadable. Panic clawed at him, and with a choked sob, he struck himself hard across the face.

Still, Julian toyed with the gun, his indifference more terrifying than any outburst. Desperate, Mr. Pembroke hit himself again—harder, faster. The sickening sound of flesh striking flesh echoed through the grand hall. Blood trickled from his split lips, his face swelling grotesquely.

After what felt like an eternity—his features now a distorted mess—Julian finally stood. With a dismissive flick of his wrist, he tossed the pistol to an attendant. "This model is worthless. Find a better supplier," he remarked coolly.

The model?

Mr. Pembroke’s eyes bulged in disbelief. The gun was a fake?

Relief surged through him, his breath escaping in a shuddering exhale. But before he could savor the moment, Julian’s voice sliced through the air like a blade. "Send him to that place," he commanded, hands sliding into his pockets. "He’s banned from Northshire. And find a competent buyer for Crystalpeak Hot Springs—then liquidate it. The property no longer serves a purpose."

Mr. Pembroke’s blood ran cold.

That place.

The mere whisper of it was enough to paralyze anyone. A lawless, merciless abyss—once you entered, you never left.

"Mr. Montclair, I beg you! One more chance!" he wailed, his voice raw and broken, blood dripping from his battered lips.

But Julian didn’t even glance his way. The mercenaries—towering, stone-faced men radiating silent menace—hauled Mr. Pembroke away, ignoring his screams and thrashing.

The cemetery was hushed, the air heavy with grief and whispered farewells. Vivian stood motionless before Catherine’s grave, her gaze distant. After a long, silent moment, she murmured a quiet goodbye and turned away without another word.

Outside the iron gates, Audrey was furiously swiping through her phone, her frustration palpable. "I’ve refreshed this app fifty times, and there’s still no ride to Crestwood from this godforsaken place," she groaned.

Vivian, already anticipating the struggle, replied calmly, "If there’s no car, we’ll take the bus."

Audrey let out an exaggerated sigh, her nose wrinkling in distaste. "A bus? With the delightful aroma of sweat, desperation, and questionable life choices? I’d rather face Dominic Sinclair again. At least then I wouldn’t have to endure this."


###Chapter 296

Audrey's words died in her throat when she realized Vivian wasn't paying attention. She glanced up with a frown—and immediately stiffened.

A polished Maybach sat idling by the curb, Ethan standing beside it in his impeccable chauffeur's uniform. The moment their eyes met, Ethan approached with measured steps. "Mrs. Blackwood, Ms. Winslow," he greeted with a slight bow. "Mr. Blackwood requested I escort you home."

Ethan's mouth opened slightly as if considering additional words, but he ultimately remained silent.

Truthfully, he wished he'd filmed Adrian's erratic behavior yesterday for Vivian to witness. After leaving Willowbrook, Ethan hadn't even made it to the highway before Adrian summoned another driver to retrieve him.

Vivian, long accustomed to Adrian's mercurial moods, wordlessly entered the vehicle.

Audrey followed, muttering darkly as she settled into the leather seat. "Fine, we'll accept the ride. But mark my words—those divorce papers are still getting signed."

Ethan visibly flinched, the atmosphere in the car turning instantly oppressive. Audrey certainly knew how to kill a mood.

"Mrs. Blackwood," he ventured cautiously, "while Mr. Blackwood can be... difficult, his heart is in the right place. He makes snap decisions in business, but regarding matters of—"

Vivian interrupted sharply. "When you sit beside a fireplace, do you analyze whether you feel warm?"

The unexpected question made Ethan stammer. "I-I suppose not?"

Vivian's gaze remained icy. "Exactly. You simply know. Love works the same way."

Before Ethan could formulate a response, Audrey leaned forward with a predatory grin. "So spare us the relationship advice and focus on the road, yeah? Unless you'd prefer I take the wheel."

Blushing furiously, Ethan nodded. "Understood." He secured their door and hurried to the driver's seat.

As the car pulled away, Audrey turned to Vivian, whispering, "You're not reconsidering, are you?"

Vivian shook her head decisively. "Never." She turned toward the window, watching the city lights smear across the glass, her mind clearly elsewhere.

Upon arriving at Seabreeze Villa, Vivian stepped into the foyer, the crisp air carrying faint notes of Adrian's cologne. Gwendolyn materialized instantly, her smile overly bright. "Welcome home, Mrs. Blackwood!"

Vivian acknowledged her with a curt nod before addressing Ethan. "Is Adrian back?"

Ethan chose his words carefully. "Mr. Blackwood had urgent business in Frostholm tonight."

"Frostholm?" Hadn't he agreed to finalize the divorce? This sudden trip couldn't be coincidental. Vivian's frown deepened. "I thought his current project was in Emberglow County?"

Ethan maintained his professional demeanor. "The Blackwood Group operates internationally, Mrs. Blackwood."

Vivian's patience snapped. "Since when does the CEO personally oversee every minor project?"

Ethan didn't falter. "Mr. Blackwood believes hands-on leadership drives our success."

###Chapter 297

Vivian arched an eyebrow, unimpressed. "How remarkably coincidental."

Ethan knew better than to argue. Handing Vivian's luggage to Gwendolyn, he added, "If you require anything, Mrs. Blackwood, Gwendolyn will assist. I must return to the office." With that, he made a swift exit, leaving Vivian and Gwendolyn standing in the grand foyer.

Gwendolyn clutched the suitcase, but instead of moving toward the staircase, she hesitated, her curiosity palpable. She turned to Vivian, her voice carefully measured. "Mrs. Blackwood... did you and Mr. Blackwood have a disagreement?"

Vivian's sharp gaze caught the unusual gleam in Gwendolyn's eyes. It wasn't concern—it was something closer to anticipation. Her instincts screamed caution.

"Do you wish we had?" Vivian countered, her tone razor-sharp. Her gut told her to keep the divorce proceedings far from Gwendolyn's prying ears.

Gwendolyn faltered, her practiced smile slipping momentarily before she plastered it back on. "Heavens no! I pray you and Mr. Blackwood remain blissfully in love forever."

Vivian's lips curled into a knowing smirk. "Precisely."

"We'll be blissfully in love forever." Leaning in conspiratorially, she tugged her collar aside to reveal a faint mark on her neck. "Who knows? Perhaps we'll even welcome a little heir this year."

Gwendolyn's grip turned bone-white as her eyes locked onto the mark. Her mind reeled. It appeared Adrian and Vivian's relationship was actually thriving.

Just then, Vivian's phone buzzed, shattering the tension. She glanced at the group chat message from Damien: "Don't leave after filming. I'm coming with exciting news."

During lunch break, the crew mingled over boxed meals. Sebastian lounged with his chair tilted back, casually sliding a chicken wing into Vivian's container. Vivian took a bite and remarked, "Mr. Vaughn should consider heartier options. These meals barely qualify as sustenance."

Right on cue, Damien appeared bearing two bags of premium coffee. "My apologies. I'll ensure tomorrow's catering includes more substantial portions."

As he distributed the drinks, he announced, "Today we'll be selecting cast members for this week's Spotlight Night." The popular variety show was a coveted platform, regularly featuring A-list hosts and rising stars to promote their latest projects.

The room fell silent, anticipation thickening the air. Damien's unexpected visit clearly signaled more than routine casting decisions.

After a deliberate sip of coffee, he revealed, "I intend to use this opportunity to unveil Vivian as the true Katrina."

Sebastian's expression turned thoughtful. "Isn't that premature? We agreed to wait until post-production."

Damien set down his cup. "By airtime, filming will be nearly complete." His tone brooked no argument. "This timing will maximize publicity."

Considering this, Sebastian planted his feet firmly on the ground, ticking off points on his fingers. "We are indeed approaching wrap."
###Chapter 298

"Vivian, what do you think?" His intense gaze sought her opinion.

Vivian paused, stirring her iced tea with a straw before responding coolly, "I'm fine with whatever the team decides."

"Then it's settled," Damien stated firmly. He'd made this special trip because the buzz surrounding Vivian's secret identity was reaching fever pitch. Revealing it on Spotlight Night would maximize the impact.

Across town, Serena lounged on a designer sofa, wrapped in a cashmere throw while scrolling through her phone. Gregory Thornton, the director, approached with an ingratiating smile. "Serena, Spotlight Night wants some of our cast for their next episode. We thought you and Julian would be perfect."

Serena didn't even glance up from her game. "Not interested. Ask someone else."

Her preoccupation with Vivian and Adrian's growing closeness had drained her completely. The last thing she wanted was to appear on some vapid variety show.

Gregory blinked in surprise - this was a coveted opportunity. Seeing his hesitation, Miranda Graves interjected, recognizing the promotional value. "Serena darling, this could really boost our show's ratings. Think of the exposure!"

With an irritated sigh, Serena tossed her phone aside. "I said no. Why should I be the only one promoting this project? Adrian financed the whole thing. Now I'm supposed to market it too? What exactly are the others contributing - just being pretty set decorations?"

Her blatant disregard for teamwork, despite her financial stake, left Gregory cold. "Fine," he replied evenly. "If you won't go, I'll send the supporting actress with Julian instead."

Miranda continued pressing. "If you're worried about Vivian, remember Mr. Blackwood invested heavily in you. Shouldn't you show some return on that investment?"

"That's none of his concern," Serena snapped.

Miranda couldn't help but wonder - what exactly did Adrian see in this spoiled brat?

Meanwhile, Vivian had agreed to unveil her secret identity, and Damien moved quickly. He immediately called Mr. Pembroke, Spotlight Night's executive producer. "We've confirmed Sebastian and Vivian will appear, Mr. Pembroke," he announced.

Mr. Pembroke's response was lukewarm at best. "Right. Noted."

He couldn't understand why the head of Ivory Phoenix Productions kept pushing this unknown actress. Initially, the network had resisted including Vivian - an untested newcomer with rumors swirling about her faking a relationship with Sebastian. Even after those rumors were disproven, some stubborn viewers still believed them.

Having both appear together would make it seem like the producers were chasing cheap publicity. Spotlight Night didn't need help with ratings - they were more concerned with maintaining their prestigious reputation. But Damien had insisted, even threatening Sebastian's withdrawal if Vivian wasn't included. The network had reluctantly agreed.

Damien smirked at Mr. Pembroke's indifferent tone. He couldn't wait to see the man's reaction. Casually, he added, "Oh, one more thing - Vivian isn't just the lead actress."

"She's also the renowned screenwriter Vivian Hartley, and this is her original work."

"Vivian... Wait, Vivian Hartley?" Mr. Pembroke nearly choked on his coffee, hastily setting down the mug as hot liquid splashed onto his hand. Eyes wide, he sputtered, "You can't be serious! Everyone knows Vivian Hartley is some middle-aged recluse. There's no way she's that stunning young actress!"
###Chapter 299

Damien Vaughn suppressed a laugh, his tone unwavering. "I wouldn't joke about something this serious, Mr. Thornton. I regard you as a friend, which is why I'm dropping this bombshell on you."

"Truly appreciate it," Gregory Thornton replied, gratitude lacing his words before ending the call. A wave of disbelief washed over him. Stepping into the hallway, Gregory couldn't resist telling every staff member he encountered that kindness always gets rewarded. He credited his sudden stroke of luck to his past generosity and felt certain the upcoming episode would shatter ratings records. Vivian Hartley's acting debut! She was starring in her own screenplay, playing the lead opposite Sebastian Hartwell. Any single one of these facts could dominate entertainment headlines.

When his initial excitement subsided, Gregory still felt it wasn't sufficient. He grabbed his phone and tweeted, "Spotlight Night has landed a superstar guest this week. Prepare for record-breaking viewership."

Miranda Graves opened Twitter and saw Gregory's post.

Remembering what Gregory had hinted earlier, she mused, "Who's coming?"

Having collaborated with Serena Whitmore on multiple shows, Gregory had developed a strong personal connection with her. He privately messaged Miranda, "Sebastian Hartwell's drama team is joining Spotlight Night. Both Sebastian and the female lead, Vivian Hartley, will appear." The episode hadn't aired yet, so he kept Vivian's secret identity under wraps but couldn't resist mentioning her name.

Assuming Sebastian was the major guest Gregory referenced, Miranda didn't dwell on it. She simply handed her phone to Serena and announced, "Vivian's appearing on Spotlight Night."

"Vivian?" Serena froze momentarily before snatching the phone. She narrowed her eyes at the screen, her voice turning razor-sharp. "I want to go too."

Miranda blinked in surprise. Serena's abrupt change of heart meant she needed to backtrack with Gregory, whom she'd just rejected. Before Miranda could respond, Serena thrust the phone back and strode toward the exit, calling after Gregory. "Wait up, Gregory!"

Gregory halted, his irritation still evident. Miranda caught up with Serena, mentally preparing to smooth things over. "Gregory, Serena wasn't herself earlier and spoke out of frustration. Please don't take it personally. She regrets her words and wants to apologize. We're absolutely committed to joining the show."

The weight of recent frustrations pressed heavily on Gregory's shoulders. These days, he'd watch helplessly from the monitor as Serena botched nearly every scene. Her line delivery remained flat and emotionless, her expressions as stiff as the set pieces surrounding her. It wasn't just the subpar acting - Serena couldn't even be bothered to memorize longer lines. During filming, she'd lazily mouth "1, 2, 3, 4, 5," relying entirely on post-production dubbing to salvage her performance. The thought of facing inevitable online backlash made Gregory's stomach churn.

Though he didn't trust Miranda's repeated assurances, he had little choice but to proceed. Serena's name still carried weight, and her presence would undoubtedly generate buzz. That didn't mean he had to make it easy for them.

With a stern expression, Gregory addressed Miranda sharply. "First she says no, then she changes her mind. What if she flip-flops again in three days? How do I explain that to production? Internal crew adjustments are manageable, but messing with a show's lineup is catastrophic. I can't fix that kind of disaster."

Serena, oblivious to Gregory's frustration, barely paid attention. Her eyes darted around the room while she schemed ways to humiliate Vivian during the live broadcast.

Visibly exasperated, Miranda stepped forward to mediate. "She won't back out," she insisted, tugging at Serena's arm for emphasis. "Serena, tell the director yourself. You're definitely participating, right?"
###Chapter 300

The realization hit Vivian like a splash of cold water. She gave a careless shrug. "Fine, I'll do it."

There was no other choice.

Unlike scripted dramas, reality shows thrived on raw authenticity and quick thinking.

If she played the wounded dove perfectly, Audrey's blunt, no-filter personality would naturally repel the audience.

The court of public opinion would do all the work for her.

Seabreeze Villa

An unusual silence blanketed the mansion.

With Adrian away on business, Vivian relished the rare tranquility.

Audrey burst in for dinner, her infectious energy filling the space instantly.

After dismissing Gwendolyn for the evening, Vivian pulled out her phone to order Sichuan hotpot delivery.

When the feast arrived, they arranged the steaming pots on the glass coffee table.

Perched on plush floor cushions, Vivian powered up the home theater system.

She browsed new releases before selecting an acclaimed indie film.

As the studio logo appeared, Audrey suddenly paused it. "We're stuffing our faces with spicy broth - how are we supposed to follow some artsy plot?" She waved her phone. "Let's watch something mindless instead."

"Since when did you become a livestream addict?" Vivian teased, eyeing Audrey's latest-model smartphone.

That titanium-edged device probably cost more than some people's monthly rent.

Audrey just shrugged, casting her screen to the projector. "It's just background noise. Helps me... not think."

Vivian didn't press further.

She knew Audrey was still processing things with Dominic.

Matters of the heart required delicate handling.

The screen flickered to life with a trending livestream.

Audrey's chopsticks clattered against her bowl. "Holy shit - isn't that your demon spawn stepsister?"

Vivian's gaze snapped upward, her expression turning glacial as Natasha's tear-streaked face filled the screen.

Dressed in a hospital gown, her carefully arranged bruises and puffy eyes crafted the perfect victim aesthetic.

Natasha clutched a tissue, her voice breaking on cue. "I don't understand why Vivian despises me so much." A practiced sob. "Maybe she resents me for... for simply existing in Father's life." Dramatic pause. "I've forgiven her for everything, but now with Father's company collapsing... doesn't she care that half those assets are rightfully hers too?"

She buried her face in her hands as the live chat exploded with outrage.

Audrey nearly choked on her dumpling. "Are you fucking kidding me? That conniving little -"

Her furious tirade was interrupted by the ping of Vivian's phone.


###Chapter 301

Natasha's livestream was a masterclass in manipulation. Her tear-streaked face and trembling lips played perfectly to the audience's voyeuristic tendencies.

With calculated precision, she spun a web of lies, positioning Vivian as the villain in her carefully constructed narrative.

The implication was clear - despite Vivian's marriage to Adrian, she'd allegedly been stringing Maxwell along, fueling his obsession until it turned violent.

Natasha's dramatic pause before revealing her "rape" sent shockwaves through the chat. Viewers ate up every word, their outrage growing with each fabricated detail.

She even flashed what appeared to be official medical documents. Though they contained no direct evidence against Vivian, the bureaucratic stamp lent credibility to her claims.

Sympathy flooded the comments, but Natasha wasn't after pity. This was strategic warfare.

Her true objective? Forcing Vivian to bail out Richard's failing enterprise - Dawson Enterprises.

The company had been Catherine's brainchild, built from her life savings and family connections. She'd nurtured it through its infancy before marriage shifted her priorities.

When Catherine handed the reins to Richard, the decline began. Now, years later, Dawson Enterprises stood on the brink of collapse.

Desperate, Richard had first tried exploiting Maxwell's obsession with Vivian. Then, when Vivian married Adrian, he'd briefly considered targeting Blackwood Group before realizing his mistake.

"That bastard Maxwell should've married that snake Natasha from the start," Audrey hissed, stabbing her salad with unnecessary force. "They're made for each other - both determined to drag you down with them."

Across the table, Vivian's grip on her cutlery tightened. Her mind was miles away from their lunch.

She mechanically speared a piece of chicken, dipped it in Audrey's homemade dressing, and chewed without tasting. "They're drowning," she said quietly. "And they'll pull anyone under to save themselves."

The food turned to ash in her mouth, her appetite destroyed by the growing storm.

The rumors themselves didn't frighten Vivian - she'd weathered worse. What kept her up at night was the potential fallout for her current project.

Negative publicity could derail everything.

Fortunately, Natasha's livestream was short-lived. Reports flooded in, and the platform took it down within hours. But screenshots were already circulating.

Vivian's phone buzzed incessantly. The first call came from Damien, his voice tight with concern. "Vivian, have you seen Natasha's broadcast?"

"Yes," Vivian sighed, exhaustion weighing down the single syllable. "And she's not my sister - she's my stepmother's daughter."

...

...
###Chapter 302

Vivian's fingers tightened around her phone. "I'm absolutely sure Natasha was involved in my kidnapping last time."

Damien exhaled heavily. "I've been monitoring your case closely, but Maxwell Sterling remains at large."

He hesitated before continuing. "Without concrete evidence, it's impossible to pin this on Natasha."

His voice turned razor-sharp. "Shutting down the livestream so abruptly makes it seem like someone's orchestrating a cover-up."

"Was it Adrian who pulled the strings?" Vivian asked, her brow furrowing.

Audrey gasped beside her. "Wait, wasn't it you?"

"Definitely not," Damien confirmed. "By the time I learned about it, the stream had already been terminated."

Audrey's eyes widened dramatically. "Holy shit."

"A complete platform ban?" she whispered. "There's been maybe two streamers in history who got that punishment!"

The severity wasn't lost on Vivian. A full ban meant Natasha couldn't create new accounts, post content, or even appear as a guest on any digital platform.

Vivian ended the call with Damien, only to see her screen light up with notifications.

Two missed calls - one from Ethan, another from Lydia.

Seeing Ethan's name gave her pause.

Adrian.

She was ninety percent certain he'd orchestrated Natasha's downfall behind the scenes.

Choosing to return Lydia's call first, Vivian needed her agent's perspective on the developing situation.

Mid-conversation, a WhatsApp notification popped up from Damien.

The message contained more bad news.

"Adrian," Vivian muttered under her breath.

After the disastrous livestream, the producers of Spotlight Night had contacted Damien with an ultimatum: either replace Vivian immediately or postpone her appearance indefinitely.

Vivian massaged her temples. "Who knows how long this mess will last. Just replace me."

Lydia's response came after a thoughtful pause. "No, that won't work. You're part of the main cast. If we let them replace you now, it'll set a dangerous precedent. We need to fix this first, then worry about promotions."

The weight of the situation pressed down on Vivian's shoulders. Somewhere in Crestwood, Adrian Blackwood was moving pieces on a chessboard she couldn't even see.
###Chapter 303

Vivian relayed Lydia's suggestion to Damien, who nodded in agreement with her logic.

They concluded it would be wisest to alter their public personas on the show temporarily.

The next morning, Vivian descended the stairs to find Adrian seated on the couch, still wearing his perfectly fitted suit with the silk tie impeccably tied.

He must have just arrived home.

At the sound of her footsteps, he lifted his gaze slowly to meet hers.

Vivian's first thought was that he'd returned because of her.

She recalled how he'd silenced Natasha yesterday, making her realize she owed him gratitude.

Collecting herself, Vivian offered a small smile, poured him a glass of water, and said, "Thank you for handling Natasha."

He accepted the water, glanced out the window with a faint smirk, and remarked dryly, "Well, the world hasn't ended yet, has it? And you're actually thanking me?"

There was a subtle weariness about him, as if he'd rushed back without rest.

Vivian felt a flicker of emotion and quickly checked the clock. "It's almost noon."

"What would you like for lunch? I'll cook." For a fleeting moment, Adrian was transported back to when Vivian would always have a warm meal waiting.

He'd once taken their domestic routine for granted, like the permanent placement of furniture.

But everything had shifted dramatically in mere months.

A wave of melancholy hit him, and he suddenly said, "Oxtail soup."

Vivian checked the refrigerator and shook her head. "No oxtail. Beef stew instead?"

Adrian's brow furrowed, his voice tinged with irritation. "You used to keep all the ingredients stocked."

"That was then," she countered sharply. "Once upon a time, diamonds were two hundred dor a carat. Times change."

Grateful or not, she refused to remain at his beck and call.

Seeing her point, Adrian conceded. "Fine. Beef stew then. With tomatoes?"

Vivian shut the fridge firmly. "No tomatoes. Plain clear broth okay?"

Adrian fell silent, at a loss for words.

Without another glance, Vivian turned toward the kitchen.

After a moment's hesitation, Adrian headed upstairs.

Shortly after, Gwendolyn slipped into the kitchen. "Madam, need any help?"

"No thank you, I've got this." Vivian turned and noticed Gwendolyn scrolling through her phone.

The screen displayed Serena's announcement about appearing on Spotlight Night.
###Chapter 304

Vivian let out a sharp, bitter laugh. Was Serena deliberately twisting the knife deeper now that Vivian couldn't participate in the show? The moment Vivian's spot became unavailable, Serena had swooped in without hesitation.

Gwendolyn smiled slyly as she handed her phone to Vivian. "My nephew watches Spotlight Night religiously every Friday. I believe I overheard you discussing it with Miss Winslow yesterday. Weren't you supposed to be joining them?"

"Indeed," Vivian replied distractedly, her gaze drifting toward the grand staircase as her thoughts spiraled.

Had Adrian truly returned for her? Or was his sudden reappearance solely to secure Serena's position on the popular variety show?

So consumed by her suspicions, Vivian completely missed the self-satisfied smirk playing on Gwendolyn's lips.

Abandoning her cooking plans abruptly, Vivian's mood shifted like mercury.

She thrust the skimmer toward Gwendolyn, her voice icy. "Mr. Blackwood requires a clarified beef consommé."

Gwendolyn had arrived early to clean up last night's hot pot remnants. When Vivian announced she'd prepare lunch personally, the housekeeper had anticipated a rare break. Now unexpectedly drafted into service, irritation prickled her skin.

Her displeasure surfaced immediately. "Madam, you specifically promised to cook today. Isn't it rather inconsistent to suddenly delegate this task?"

A flash of annoyance sparked in Vivian's eyes. "What's improper about assigning tasks? Does the broth's origin truly matter?"

A sardonic voice sliced through their exchange. "Since when did you develop this habit of saying one thing while doing another?" Adrian descended the staircase with deliberate grace.

The gray silk loungewear draped effortlessly over his broad shoulders, the understated luxury only amplifying his commanding presence.

Vivian ignored his jab, cutting straight to the point. "Exactly how much did you invest in Spotlight Night?"

Adrian strolled toward the sofa, pausing just long enough to toss back a careless response. "That insipid variety show? I wouldn't waste a single dor on such trivial entertainment."

Vivian's eyes narrowed to slits. "Are you absolutely certain about that?"

He exhaled a laugh tinged with exasperation. "What would satisfy you? Should I call Ethan to deliver our corporate expense reports for your inspection?"

Nearby, Gwendolyn - who'd been halfheartedly washing vegetables while eavesdropping - felt a sudden pang of unease.

Her intention had merely been to stir the pot slightly, but Vivian had seized her bait and hurled it like a javelin at Adrian.

Discreetly retrieving her phone, she typed a hurried message to Serena: "She's becoming harder to manipulate."

"Fine, I'll return to the kitchen," Vivian muttered, her earlier frustration dissolving into weary resignation.

Noticing her discomfort, Adrian reached out unexpectedly, guiding her gently to his side. "Forget about cooking. Let's discuss Dawson Enterprises instead."

Startled, Vivian allowed herself to be led to the sofa, confusion flickering in her expressive eyes.
###Chapter 305

Adrian's voice held a deceptive calm, like still waters hiding dangerous undercurrents. "I've been investigating Dawson Enterprises. They recently signed a new supplier contract. Richard opted for cheaper materials to boost profits, but now the product quality has plummeted. They're facing massive compensation claims."

Before Vivian could react, her phone buzzed with an unfamiliar number.

The message glowed on her screen: "The company stands on the brink of collapse. This was your mother's legacy. Save it, and I'll give you thirty percent shares."

She handed the phone to Adrian with a bitter smile. "Speak of the devil."

"More like the devil's offering you a poisoned apple," Adrian countered, his voice casual but his piercing gaze betraying his concern.

His chest constricted watching her, but he buried the emotion deep, like precious jewels in a vault.

Adrian Blackwood had never been one for emotional exhibitions.

All he desired was to protect Vivian from life's tempests.

Yet Vivian's voice remained steady as morning frost. "He's not trying to save me. If the company recovers, they'll discard me immediately."

"And if it fails, they'll leave me drowning in debt while they escape with whatever remains."

Adrian studied her face - the delicate arch of her brows, the proud line of her nose, the perfect symmetry of her features.

At twenty-four, she should be sheltered by family, not used as their sacrificial lamb.

Vivian tilted her head up, her lips hovering dangerously close to his, the space between them charged with electricity.

The air thickened with unspoken tension neither dared acknowledge.

Vivian's gaze dropped to Adrian's lips, memories flooding back unbidden - his possessive kisses, the way his hands claimed her body.

Heat rushed to her cheeks. She quickly lowered her head, letting her hair curtain her face.

She shifted subtly, creating distance between them.

This quiet intimacy unsettled her more than their physical encounters.

Sex could be compartmentalized, treated as mechanical even.

But these stolen moments? They dismantled her defenses, awakening emotions too dangerous to name.

Adrian's dark eyes flickered at her retreat.

The ghost of a smile touched his lips before vanishing. "What's your next move?" he asked evenly.
###Chapter 306

A storm brewed in Adrian's eyes as Vivian kept evading his gaze.

Her constant dodging grated on his nerves, yet he restrained himself from pushing further.

Over time, he'd learned Vivian's body language often revealed truths her guarded mind concealed.

She squared her shoulders, voice steeled with determination. "Dawson Enterprises was my mother's legacy. I won't let them ruin it. And I certainly won't let them win. They'll answer for everything."

Years of resentment hardened each syllable.

Though sharing Richard Dawson as a father, Natasha had always been the golden child while Vivian remained merely a pawn - useful when convenient, disposable when not.

Vivian allowed herself a fleeting moment of reflection.

Being sent to live with Eleanor Sutton as a child had been Richard's single act of mercy.

Eleanor had nurtured traditional values and fierce independence in her, shielding Vivian from becoming another sycophant groveling for Richard's approval.

Without her grandmother's influence, Vivian doubted she'd possess the fortitude to stand her ground now.

Adrian reclined in his chair, dark eyes never wavering. "I'll assist you."

Vivian's immediate refusal died on her lips.

She knew the stark reality - this battle required resources far beyond her means.

After a weighted pause, she countered. "I don't need charity. Let's structure this as a business transaction. Loan me the capital, and I'll repay it within thirty days. As interest, you'll receive twenty percent of Dawson Enterprises."

Adrian arched an eyebrow, fingers drumming an impatient rhythm against his knee.

Her clinical tone needled him.

"What use would I have for shares in such a modest enterprise?"

The barb struck true.

Even at its peak, Dawson Enterprises' monthly earnings couldn't rival the price tag of Adrian's simplest timepiece.

Offering him minority shares suddenly seemed laughably inadequate.

Suspicion darkened her gaze. "Then what are your terms?"

"Forget the shares. Keep the money." His shrug was deliberately casual. "Once your film wraps, accompany me on holiday."

Vivian exhaled imperceptibly.

She'd braced for something far more sinister - perhaps demands regarding Serena or their marital status.

This... was tolerable. "Agreed." Her response came swiftly. "But understand this - I will repay the loan. If you decline the shares, that's your choice, but I don't accept handouts."

Adrian's jaw tightened, pride stung by her insistence on maintaining boundaries. "As you wish," he bit out.

Just when Vivian thought the conversation couldn't deteriorate further, her phone vibrated with an urgent alert.
###Chapter 307

Lydia's message popped up on Vivian's phone with urgent insistence. "Check Twitter now."

Vivian's fingers froze mid-air as a cold dread settled in her stomach.

Just seeing the word "Twitter" made her temples throb.

She didn't need to open the app to know what awaited her. Where Natasha was involved, disaster always followed.

The aftermath of Natasha's latest livestream spread like wildfire across social media.

Though Natasha had cleverly avoided direct names, the internet sleuths had pieced together their twisted narrative with frightening speed.

Vivian's face plastered every trending thread, accompanied by vicious accusations that cut deeper than before.

They branded her heartless sister. Uncaring daughter. And now - the most damaging label yet - gold-digging mistress.

The speculation ran wild, with countless voices questioning how an unknown like Vivian landed a role opposite Sebastian Hartwell.

The consensus? She must be sleeping with someone powerful.

#VivianSugarBaby climbed the charts at alarming speed.

And one name kept surfacing in every conversation: Damien Vaughn of Ivory Phoenix Productions.

"People are so easily fooled," Adrian muttered darkly, his jaw tightening as he scrolled through the fawning comments about Damien's wealth. Without hesitation, he screenshotted the worst offenders and forwarded them to Ethan.

Within seconds, Ethan responded. "On it, sir. I'll have the trending tags removed and offending accounts suspended." A pause, then: "Perhaps this would be an opportune moment to make your marriage public? Mrs. Blackwood has expressed concerns about her official status before."

Adrian's fingers stilled over the keyboard. He replied with a single icy punctuation mark: "?"

Ethan's backpedaling was immediate. "My apologies, sir. That was out of line."

"Ethan's handling it," Adrian said, setting his phone aside to study Vivian's reaction.

Vivian didn't look reassured. She massaged her temples with a weary sigh. "We can't silence everyone forever. Being in the public eye means accepting some criticism."

Adrian recalled Ethan's suggestion. Casually, he offered, "There is one way to end these rumors permanently."

As predicted, Vivian's attention snapped to him. She lowered her phone, curiosity flickering in her guarded eyes.

Meeting her gaze, Adrian delivered the solution like it was the most obvious thing in the world. "Announce you're married. That you're Mrs. Blackwood. No one would dare accuse you of chasing sponsors then."

Vivian's eyes narrowed as she took in his smug expression. Wordlessly, she twisted the cap off her water bottle and took a deliberate sip.

Her lack of enthusiasm grated on Adrian's nerves. "You claim to care about acting, not being some idol. So what's the problem? Unless..." His voice turned razor-sharp. "You prefer people thinking you're involved with someone like Damien to maintain your 'available' image?"
###Chapter 308

Adrian barely stopped himself from blurting out, "Or are you just refusing to acknowledge I'm your husband?" The words tasted dangerously like jealousy on his tongue, so he swallowed them just in time.

Vivian placed her water bottle on the table with deliberate precision, her jaw set. "If I go public about our marriage now—when I'm just establishing myself, working with A-list actors, and dealing with all this backlash—people will assume every opportunity came from your influence."

His brow furrowed in genuine confusion. "Wouldn't that be better than them labeling you as some mistress?"

Her eyes flashed with defiance. "What exactly have you ever given me? Every achievement is mine alone, earned through my own sweat."

Adrian shrugged, completely unbothered. "So you're blaming me for not spoiling you? Fine. If you want lead roles, brand deals, or magazine covers, I'll have Ethan arrange everything by tomorrow."

"Don't bother." She rolled her eyes so hard it nearly hurt. "Just stop, Adrian."

Vivian stood abruptly, the tension making the sofa feel like a bed of nails. But Adrian's fingers closed around her wrist like a manacle before she could escape. His voice turned razor-sharp. "If you've got something to say, say it properly. These half-spoken jabs—is this your idea of entertainment?"

The sudden tug threw her off balance, sending her tumbling into his lap. She recovered instantly, pushing away with enough force to put three feet between them.

This time, she met his gaze head-on. "I'm not asking for handouts, Adrian. I want my work to stand on its own merits. I won't hide behind anyone's shadow just to avoid criticism."

For a heartbeat, Adrian simply stared, momentarily stunned by the steel in her voice. Then, to her shock, he gave a single sharp nod. "Understood."

The sudden concession left Vivian unbalanced. She studied him warily, searching for the catch.

Before she could probe further, his attention shifted to Gwendolyn setting the dining table. "Let's eat," he declared, his tone neutral.

"Fine," Vivian murmured, moving toward the table.

They sat in loaded silence, the clink of silverware the only conversation. Adrian speared a slice of beef and deposited it on Vivian's plate with unexpected gentleness. "If you need Ethan's help with anything, just say the word. You're not alone in this fight, Vivian. No begging required."

Vivian stared at the offering, the simple gesture carrying unexpected weight. For the first time, she wondered—when their arrangement ended, could they remain in each other's lives? Not as husband and wife, but perhaps... as allies?

The meal passed with fragile civility. When Adrian left for his office afterward, Vivian seized the unexpected free afternoon for reinvention.

In her walk-in closet, she selected armor for her next battle: a dove-gray silk blouse, knife-pleated trousers, and stilettos that could double as weapons. She twisted her hair into a severe ponytail and painted her lips the color of dried blood—the perfect mask of unshakable confidence.

Descending the stairs with her designer bag swinging like a pendulum, she nearly collided with Gwendolyn. The housekeeper's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Mrs. Blackwood, where might you be headed?"

Something about the probing tone set Vivian's teeth on edge. "Just some retail therapy," she lied smoothly.
###Chapter 309

Vivian's instincts flared as she faced Gwendolyn's probing gaze. The housekeeper's eyes narrowed with skepticism. "That's quite an elegant outfit for a simple shopping trip, Mrs. Blackwood. More suitable for a business meeting, wouldn't you say?"

Vivian's fingers tightened around her purse strap. "Since when do I need your approval for my wardrobe choices?" Her voice dripped with frost. "This is what I chose to wear today. Do you have an issue with that?"

Gwendolyn's cheeks flushed. "I didn't mean to offend," she stammered, dropping her gaze. "You're rather... spirited today, Mrs. Blackwood."

"And you're rather nosy for someone employed to manage Seabreeze Villa, not my personal affairs." Vivian's stiletto heels struck the marble stairs like gunshots as she descended.

The garage door lifted to reveal her sleek Bentley Continental. Halfway to her destination, Vivian pulled over to unblock Richard's number. His voice crackled through the speakers, laced with sarcasm. "Well, well. The prodigal daughter returns. What do you want now that you suddenly remember we exist?"

"We need to talk," Vivian stated, her knuckles whitening on the steering wheel.

Richard's reply came clipped. "Come to Dawson Enterprises. We're leaving for the hospital to visit your sister soon—no time for detours."

"Thirty minutes. The office." Vivian ended the call and threw her phone onto the passenger seat, accelerating toward the free-trade zone.

The new location of Dawson Enterprises bore no resemblance to its former downtown address from Vivian's childhood. Twenty years had transformed the area into a hub of modest businesses, where economy cars dominated the parking lots. Her Bentley's purring engine turned heads as she pulled in.

Just as she parked, a taxi disgorged Richard and Daphne. Though only days had passed since their last encounter, time had carved deeper lines into their faces. Daphne's thick foundation couldn't mask the new wrinkles or the purple shadows beneath her eyes.

Richard's expression darkened when he spotted the luxury vehicle. "Selling just one of these could've saved our company," he spat. "Yet you watched us drown. What kind of monster does that?"

Daphne seized the moment, dabbing at dry eyes for the growing audience. "You may hate us, but Natasha's innocent! How could you let this happen to your own flesh and blood?"

Murmurs rippled through the crowd. The beautiful woman in designer clothes now appeared heartless under their scrutiny.

Vivian crossed her arms, her emerald eyes glacial. "If you're here to perform your victim act, save it. If you want help, try asking properly."

The couple's bravado evaporated. Vivian took one measured step forward—the click of her Louboutins silencing the whispers. An invisible forcefield of authority surrounded her as she addressed the gawkers. "Before judging, make sure you know the full story. Don't be someone's puppet."

Coming from anyone else, it might have sounded like bluster. But Vivian Hartley-Blackwood carried herself with the unshakable confidence of someone who'd earned every ounce of her power. The crowd parted like the Red Sea as she strode toward the glass office tower. After a beat, Richard and Daphne scrambled after her, their earlier theatrics forgotten.
###Chapter 310

The office of Dawson Enterprises felt eerily silent, like a tomb waiting to be sealed. Employees sat frozen at their workstations, exchanging nervous whispers and stealing furtive glances toward the conference room. The air was heavy with the unspoken truth - the company was on the brink of collapse.

The conference room doors stood slightly open, revealing a gathering of anxious shareholders. They slumped in leather chairs, chain-smoking with restless energy, their faces drawn with defeat. When Richard and Daphne entered, the shareholders sprang to life. They rushed forward like drowning men spotting a life raft. "Richard! Thank God you're here!"

"What's the plan? The defective products have triggered massive lawsuits! Clients are demanding compensation! Are we supposed to just take this loss? What did the suppliers say?"

"I thought you were handling negotiations with them?" Richard avoided their accusing stares, rubbing his nose nervously. He couldn't confront the suppliers - not when he'd accepted their bribes.

Daphne smoothly stepped forward, flashing her practiced socialite smile. "Everyone, please remain calm. Richard shares your concerns completely. As majority shareholder, he has the most to lose. That's why he's brought Vivian here to help resolve this crisis."

Her words seemed to bolster Richard's confidence. He straightened his tie with false bravado. "Exactly. My daughter is here now. And need I remind you all - her husband is Adrian Blackwood, CEO of Blackwood Group. A situation like this is child's play for him."

All eyes turned to Vivian. Their initial anger momentarily gave way to surprise. Vivian stood apart from the others, radiating quiet authority that commanded attention. They'd only known Natasha before - a pretty socialite dripping in designer labels but lacking substance. Now they understood why Vivian, not Natasha, had married into the powerful Blackwood family.

But admiration quickly gave way to desperation. With bankruptcy looming, there was no time for niceties. The shareholders exchanged meaningful looks before their appointed spokesman stepped forward. "Ms. Hartley," he began cautiously, "the company faces catastrophic liabilities. To restart operations, we'll need significant capital injection."

"How much is Blackwood Group willing to invest?"

Vivian didn't answer immediately. She walked calmly to an empty chair and sat with deliberate grace, crossing her legs with effortless elegance. "Business is business," she said coolly. "Investing now would be charity. Blackwood Group doesn't do handouts. Why should they clean up someone else's mess?"

The shareholders froze, their hopeful expressions crumbling. Muttered protests began rippling through the room. "Are you serious?" one finally exploded. "You think you can bully us just because you married into the Blackwoods? We won't take this lying down! If you're not here to help, why bother coming at all?"

Richard's face flushed crimson with humiliation. He shot Vivian a venomous glare. "I thought you came to fix this! Why are you making things worse?"

Vivian remained unshaken, her composure unbreakable as she met his gaze. "I never said I came to fix your problems." She leaned back slightly, her voice calm and measured. "I'm here to make an offer."

"What kind of offer?" another shareholder asked, his anger giving way to cautious interest. The others exchanged wary glances, their frustration tempered by growing curiosity.

Though the youngest in the room, Vivian carried herself with the same commanding presence as the seasoned executives surrounding her. She'd learned well from Adrian's composed leadership style. Unlike Richard's blustering, her quiet confidence spoke volumes about who truly held power here.

With perfect poise, Vivian delivered her ultimatum: "When this company declares bankruptcy, those shares you're clinging to will become worthless. Wouldn't it be smarter to sell them to me now - while they still have some value?"
###Chapter 311

Richard interrupted sharply, "Out of the question! Didn't I promise you shares after resolving this mess? What's this sudden demand?"

He'd involved Vivian not to genuinely save Dawson Enterprises from collapse, but as a pawn in his own escape plan. Richard's business incompetence, worsened by Natasha's scandal, had severed ties with potential allies. He and Daphne planned to liquidate assets through Vivian, flee abroad, and leave creditors chasing shadows.

If Vivian consolidated shares now, it would drain the funds meant for their getaway. After meticulously drawing her into this trap, Richard wouldn't let her flip the game board.

Vivian's gaze turned glacial as she addressed the room. "Even if we survive this crisis, Dawson Enterprises' obsolete business model is doomed. Face it—I'm your only viable buyer."

Shareholders exchanged uneasy glances, smelling an exit strategy. Richard rushed to intervene, "With proper funding, we'll secure new suppliers and deliver orders. The projected profits outweigh current losses."

Their greed, as always, knew no limits.

Swayed by Richard's empty promises, shareholders turned on Vivian. "Ms. Hartley, this is your family legacy," one wheedled. "Half should rightfully be yours. Would you really hold grudges against your own father? Help us now, and he'll remember your kindness."

The mood turned hostile. "How can you be so heartless?" another snapped. "You're just exploiting this crisis to seize control! But do you even have what it takes to run this company?"

Murmurs of agreement filled the room until a voice cut through like arctic wind. "My wife might lack experience, but I don't."

All heads swiveled toward the entrance where Adrian Blackwood strode in, Ethan Caldwell trailing with armfuls of documents. Towering over everyone with his chiseled features and commanding presence, Adrian looked like he'd stepped off a luxury watch advertisement. The Blackwood heir needed no introduction.

Ethan placed a chair beside Vivian. Adrian sat, interlacing their fingers. "You shouldn't face wolves alone."

Vivian arched a brow, playing along. "I didn't want to trouble the busy CEO."

Richard and Daphne exchanged panicked looks—they hadn't anticipated Adrian's personal involvement. Forcing a smile, Richard stepped forward. "Mr. Blackwood, this minor internal matter hardly warrants your attention."

Adrian's laugh held no warmth. "Minor? When you're bullying my wife?"

Ethan surveyed the room—Vivian was the only one seated, perfectly composed. He marveled at Adrian's ability to spin narratives, even when exaggerating.

With theatrical flourish, Ethan scattered documents across the conference table, sparking chaos among shareholders.

Vivian skimmed the papers, recognizing their lethal potential instantly. These were smoking guns—proof of Richard's mismanagement and other shareholders' embezzlement. Dawson Enterprises wasn't just failing; it was being looted. She'd uncovered most herself, gathering the courage to confront this den of thieves alone today.

The real game was about to begin.
###Chapter 312

Adrian Blackwood's voice dripped with casual menace as he drawled, "Shall I begin enumerating every single one of your illicit transactions?" His piercing gaze swept across the boardroom, making each shareholder feel like prey caught in a predator's sight. While Vivian Hartley's stare could cut glass, Adrian's was downright murderous. An icy tension settled over the room, as if an executioner's blade hovered mere centimeters from their throats.

Their pathetic company wasn't even fit to partner with a Blackwood Group subsidiary, and under Adrian's relentless scrutiny, they resembled frightened rabbits, scarcely daring to blink.

One gray-haired board member summoned his last shred of courage. "Mr. Blackwood, even if there are... irregularities, they're internal matters. Your wife may be Mr. Dawson's daughter, but she holds no shares or official position here."

"Are you accusing me of interference?" Adrian's fingers absently traced circles on Vivian's wrist, her skin like satin beneath his touch. The older man gave a nervous chuckle. "I meant no offense."

With a dangerous smile, Adrian countered, "How unfortunate. I rather enjoy interfering." His gaze flicked to Vivian, brimming with wicked amusement that silently asked for her approval. Vivian marveled at his audacity to flirt so shamelessly in this corporate battlefield, nearly shattering her carefully constructed professional facade.

Flirting was one thing, but did he have to be so blatant? Heat flooded her cheeks as she discreetly dug her nails into his palm. To Adrian, it felt like a kitten's playful nip, and he only tightened his grip in response. Fortunately, the other occupants were too preoccupied with the damning financial documents, sweating bullets, to notice their intimate exchange. Only Ethan Caldwell, standing sentinel behind Adrian, caught the entire interaction. A quiet satisfaction warmed him - perhaps his boss was finally learning the art of romance. The notoriously professional Adrian Blackwood had never indulged in such behavior during business negotiations before.

Vivian regained her composure, voice steady as polished steel. "My offer may not be the highest, but it's fair. I'm proposing the same valuation for all shares. Aren't you concerned Richard might sell yours out from under you? His connections run deeper than yours, and by then, your shares would be worthless."

Adrian kept one arm draped possessively around Vivian's shoulders, the other entwined with her fingers. "Several of your activities have crossed into criminal territory. Imagine what might happen if an upstanding citizen were to report them to the authorities..."

Richard Dawson's face turned ashen. "You wouldn't dare!"

Adrian's lips curled into a mocking smile. "Dearest Father-in-law, you can either take the money and retain some dignity, or go down with your sinking ship. The choice seems obvious, doesn't it?"

The term "Father-in-law" dripped with sarcasm rather than respect. Adrian pulled Vivian closer, his breath warm against her ear as he murmured, "I've got you." The words sent an unexpected jolt through Vivian, making her question whether their fractured relationship might still hold promise. She mentally scolded herself for this weakness - how could a few tender words erase years of pain?

The shareholders watched, mesmerized, as the lethal duo exchanged flirtatious barbs sharper than any blade. They were a perfectly matched pair of corporate assassins!

Richard leaned toward Daphne Fairchild, whispering urgently, "Perhaps we should accept her offer and negotiate favorable terms. This ship is sinking fast. We could relocate overseas with Natasha and start fresh."

In his mind's eye, Richard already saw Natasha's brilliant future abroad - her beauty and cunning could easily land her a wealthy foreign husband.

###Chapter 313

Vivian shot her husband a look dripping with disdain, her lips curling at his proposal. "We're not handing over all our shares to you," she declared firmly.

Every fiber of her being warned that surrendering their stake to Adrian would slam the door on any chance of reclaiming what was rightfully theirs.

Adrian merely quirked an eyebrow, his expression unreadable. "Liquidating Dawson Enterprises could be your lifeline. Don't forget - I'm not your only potential buyer."

Richard chose that moment to interject. "This isn't our concern anymore, so we'll take our leave. Frankly, if not for your mother's legacy, I'd rather flush this money down the drain than invest it here."

He added with deliberate casualness, "Speaking of which, I heard The Mariner's Catch just got a shipment of fresh bluefin tuna. Let's grab some before it's gone."

Adrian's lips twisted into a mocking smile as he watched Richard's reaction.

Richard's face cycled through shades of pale to crimson, his entire frame trembling with outrage. "Ungrateful wretch! How did I raise such a disgrace?"

Adrian tsked in response. "Considering half my DNA comes from questionable sources, is this outcome really so surprising?"

Richard's expression darkened instantly. "Mind your tongue. She's my wife now. Any insult you throw at her, you're throwing at me."

Richard's hand twitched toward a teacup before thinking better of it and withdrawing.

Adrian's presence alone was enough to make most men reconsider their actions. More importantly, everyone knew his threats weren't empty - he always followed through.

Richard couldn't help but regret how things had deteriorated between Vivian and Adrian. When Vivian first married into the Blackwood family, she'd been the envy of Crestwood's elite. Even the Sterling family, who felt publicly humiliated, could do nothing but swallow their pride.

Even without direct support from Adrian, Richard's association with the Blackwoods had opened countless doors. Now there was no going back.

"I'll sell my shares. I own five percent."

Another shareholder stepped forward cautiously. "What's your offer?"

Adrian paused dramatically before holding up three fingers. "Three million?"

The man's eyes bulged. Even at peak valuation, the shares barely touched two million and were nearly impossible to sell - this price for a failing company was ludicrous.

Adrian chuckled darkly. "Three hundred thousand."

"Three hundred thousand?" they gasped. "That's highway robbery!"

Adrian crossed her legs leisurely. "Beyond the Dawson family's fifty-five percent, the remaining forty-five is worth maybe two seventy. Sign today, and I pay cash. Plus..." Her voice dropped to a dangerous purr. "I'll make sure any... creative accounting you've participated in stays buried."

"You'll walk away clean with no risk of exposure. Because if I bring these books to light?" She smirked. "You'd be lucky to get thirty grand for your shares."

Adrian's gaze swept over the documents littering the floor before fixing each shareholder with a look that promised retribution. The silent threat hung heavy in the air.
###Chapter 314

A shareholder suddenly slammed his fist on the table, grabbing a stack of papers and tearing them violently. Ethan stepped forward smoothly, his voice calm. "Those are duplicates. Feel free to destroy as many as you'd like - we have plenty more where those came from."

The man froze mid-action, then threw the shredded documents to the ground in frustration. Vivian remained composed, scribbling her number on a notepad before rising gracefully. "No need for hasty decisions. You have until 3 PM tomorrow. After that, the offer expires."

She extended the note toward the shareholders. Before anyone could take it, Adrian's hand intercepted hers, plucking the paper away. Vivian blinked in confusion as Ethan smoothly produced his business card instead. "For any inquiries, please contact me directly."

Unbeknownst to them, a sharply dressed young woman observed the entire exchange from just beyond the glass doors of the conference room.

Vivian continued weaving diplomatic phrases into the tense negotiations, her words softening the harsh edges of the discussion. The shareholders swayed like reeds in the wind, their agreement nearly unanimous. Only Richard and Daphne remained unmoved, their gazes burning with resentment. Undeterred, Vivian smiled serenely. "I'll await your positive response," she said before exiting with Adrian.

Outside, she leaned lightly against Adrian's arm, appearing momentarily fragile - a delicate bird seeking shelter from the storm. But the illusion shattered the moment they cleared the building's entrance. Vivian abruptly withdrew her hand as if burned, putting several feet between them. The intimate couple from moments before now stood as distant as strangers passing on a busy sidewalk.

Adrian's gaze dropped to the space where her touch had been, his eyelid twitching with barely concealed irritation. "Is this your pattern? Use people when convenient, then discard them without a second thought?"

His biting words extinguished any warmth Vivian had begun to feel. She squared her shoulders, all vulnerability vanishing. "What exactly are you implying? Did I request your dramatic rescue today?" The tension between them crackled like live wires until an unexpected voice interrupted.

"Pardon me, Mr. Blackwood."

They turned to see Lawrence, the Blackwood family driver, standing at respectful attention. His nod to Adrian held deference, but his tone cooled noticeably when addressing Vivian. "Madam Blackwood requests your presence at dinner tonight."

The mention of Margaret made Vivian hesitate. With divorce proceedings looming, facing her formidable mother-in-law seemed unwise. Yet Adrian's earlier kindness tugged at her conscience. Refusing now would only confirm his accusation of using people.

Their marriage already hung by the thinnest of threads. Any further complications could prove disastrous. Vivian's fists clenched until her knuckles whitened before she finally exhaled. "Did Margaret... mention why she wanted to see me?"

She wasn't foolish enough to believe this summons stemmed from affection. Lawrence's presence suggested Margaret likely knew about Dawson Enterprises' troubles. The longtime family retainer remained impassive. "Madam Blackwood simply instructed me to bring you home for dinner. No further details were shared."

His appearance made refusal impossible. "Am I the only one invited?" Vivian glanced sideways at Adrian, searching for any reaction. Lawrence's response came smoothly, as if prepared. "Mr. Blackwood has work commitments. Madam was quite specific about not disturbing him."
###Chapter 315

Adrian gestured toward a polished black sedan parked nearby. "The car's ready."

Vivian remained composed. "I drove myself. I can't abandon my vehicle. You go ahead—I'll follow."

Lawrence's eyebrows shot up in surprise. Margaret had clearly assumed Vivian arrived with Adrian, hence sending him to escort her back alone.

Vivian stole another glance at Adrian, but his face remained an unreadable mask.

A bitter smile twisted her lips. Was she naive enough to expect Adrian to stand against Margaret for her? The truth was painfully simple. Her ongoing tension with Margaret stemmed as much from her modest background as Adrian's indifference. Because he didn't value her, Margaret treated her as nothing more than a breeding vessel. The irony? Two years of marriage without consummation only fueled Margaret's disdain, branding Vivian as a useless tool.

Her thoughts burned as she turned away from Adrian. Without hesitation, she strode to her Maybach, movements sharp and decisive. The door clicked shut behind her with finality.

Lawrence turned to Adrian with a respectful nod. "Mr. Blackwood, I'll be leaving now."

Adrian said nothing, his mind replaying the fire in Vivian's eyes. After a beat, he asked Ethan, "Did she just glare at me?"

Ethan's stomach dropped but his expression remained neutral. "You must be mistaken, sir. Mrs. Blackwood was probably looking at Lawrence."

Adrian frowned but nodded slowly. "Right. Must've been."

At the Blackwood estate, staff informed Vivian that Adrian's grandparents had departed on vacation. The realization hit instantly—Margaret had orchestrated this timing perfectly, waiting until the elders were absent to summon her. The calculated move sharpened Vivian's unease.

In the grand living room, Margaret lounged regally on the sofa while Bianca chattered beside her, voice dripping with superiority.

Bianca's eyes locked onto Vivian the moment she entered. "How dare you show your face here?" she spat.

Margaret's expression frosted over, deliberately ignoring Vivian's presence.

Vivian met Bianca's glare head-on. "Why wouldn't I?" Her tone remained even as she turned to Margaret. "Good evening, Margaret."

Margaret didn't acknowledge her, instead examining her manicured nails with feigned interest.

Bianca lacked such restraint. Malice glittered in her eyes. "You actually convinced my cousin to bail out your family's failing business? Even with the Blackwood fortune, we can't afford parasites like you."

Vivian's mind raced. Bianca must have witnessed their presence at Dawson Enterprises earlier. Margaret's summons clearly concerned that matter. She opened her mouth to respond when a calm voice cut through.

"When exactly did the Blackwood family change its name to—"

The room froze. All heads turned as Adrian strolled in casually, his presence commanding immediate attention.

Vivian's breath caught. Adrian had actually followed her home. Coincidence? Or something more? Was he here to defend her, like in the conference room? She dismissed the thought instantly. Hope was dangerous—a fragile thread that snapped when pulled too tight.

"What are you doing here?" Margaret's voice sliced through the tension, her surprise evident as she glanced between them. Adrian visiting home uninvited was rarer than desert rain. Normally he declined even their invitations. Yet here he stood. Margaret couldn't help suspecting Vivian had dragged him along as backup.

Adrian stepped forward, blocking Margaret's view, and chuckled softly. "Mother, since when do I need an excuse to visit?"
###Chapter 316

Vivian hesitated, then exhaled sharply before pouring him a steaming cup of Ivory Summit blend. She slid it across the marble counter with a pointed look. "I heard Blackwood Group's been operating at maximum capacity lately. Between the expansion plans and that AI partnership with Frostholm - aren't you spread too thin? What brings you here instead of your office?"

"Even CEOs need breathing room," Adrian countered, shrugging off his tailored jacket and draping it over the leather sofa. "I'm not some algorithm you can run 24/7."

He settled into the chair beside Vivian, took a deliberate sip of the coffee, then extended the porcelain cup toward her. "Try it. Your favorite single-origin blend."

Her fingers trembled slightly as she accepted it, the dark liquid mirroring her unsettled thoughts.

His appearance at Dawson Enterprises earlier, and now at the Blackwood estate - this was no coincidence. While he'd defended her before, those moments felt accidental. Today carried undeniable purpose.

Margaret's hawk-like gaze tracked the exchange, her displeasure barely concealed. She turned toward the floor-to-ceiling windows. "Dawson Enterprises is beyond salvaging. Throwing money at it won't change that. If they're begging for help, write them a check and be done. Why dirty your hands with their mess?"

Adrian started to respond, but Vivian's fingers brushed his wrist in silent warning. She squared her shoulders. "Margaret, that company was my mother's life's work. She built it from nothing."

The older woman's razor-sharp stare cut through her. "Didn't you already reclaim your mother's old penthouse? How much more of your life will you waste chasing ghosts? When does it end?"

The verbal blow landed with precision. Vivian took a steadying breath, the rich coffee aroma grounding her. "The penthouse came from my personal funds. And the company isn't just about sentiment - it has real potential. Poor leadership sank it, not lack of opportunity."

Adrian's knuckles whitened around his cup as Vivian absorbed Margaret's barbs.

"Potential?" Margaret's laugh held Arctic chill. "That second-rate operation was never remarkable, even in its prime."

Adrian rolled up his sleeves with deliberate slowness, his voice deceptively calm. "Uncle Victor's ventures have burned through ten times the capital with zero returns. Everyone saw the red flags except him. Yet you never criticize his recklessness. If you need a project, Mother, perhaps redirect your attention there."

Bianca, silent until now, gasped dramatically. "Adrian!"

He didn't spare her a glance. "And you. The Thornton heiress pretending to be Crestwood royalty. Yet you spread gossip like a tabloid reporter. News travels fast in our circles. Tell me, what respectable family wants a troublemaker for a daughter-in-law?"

Bianca's mouth snapped shut, thoughts clearly turning to Dominic. She crossed her arms with a huff.

Margaret wasn't so easily silenced. Her palm struck the glass table with a crack. "Don't twist my meaning! Everything I do is for your future! The Dawsons can't compare to your uncle's family. Say what you will about Victor, but he's always come through when it mattered most. If not for him arriving when he did all those years ago, would you even be standing here today?"
###Chapter 317

Vivian blinked at Adrian, struggling to reconcile the image of him as vulnerable. This story was completely new to her - she couldn't fathom the powerful Adrian Blackwood ever needing assistance from someone as incompetent as Victor. The mental picture was ridiculous, like a grizzly bear requiring a squirrel's help to remove a splinter. Her mind refused to even form the image.

Bianca, perched eagerly on the sofa's edge, tilted her head with childlike curiosity. "When exactly did Uncle Victor save Adrian?"

Adrian's jaw visibly tensed. A brief shadow of discomfort flickered across his usually composed features. He clearly had no desire to revisit this memory.

Margaret, realizing her mistake, cleared her throat and waved dismissively. "Oh, that old story? Just some silly childhood incident."

Bianca, easily distracted, shifted her attention to Dominic, her brow furrowing with suspicion. Adrian's earlier comments had planted seeds of doubt in her mind. Was Dominic's coldness toward her because Vivian had been whispering behind her back?

Meanwhile, Vivian's thoughts spiraled downward. Adrian, the man she'd spent years trying to love and understand, remained an enigma wrapped in mystery. Layers of his life existed that she'd never uncovered. She realized with startling clarity that while she'd devoted herself to nurturing their fragile relationship, striving to be the perfect wife, she'd never truly questioned his past or attempted to know the real man beneath the polished exterior.

Yet here they were. Why had his behavior changed so dramatically recently? Was this sudden kindness genuine? Or was it all part of some calculated scheme? Theories swirled in her mind like autumn leaves. Was he clinging to their marriage out of pride alone?

With Serena back in the picture and Adrian now heading the Blackwood empire, he could have any woman he desired. So why hesitate about the divorce? Was it pure spite - refusing to let her be the one to walk away? Was he keeping her trapped to protect the Blackwood Group's reputation, or simply to save face? Vivian's mind churned with endless unanswered questions.

"Vivian." Margaret's sharp tone yanked her from her spiraling thoughts. "Stop sitting there like a statue. Go check if dinner's ready in the kitchen."

Suppressing the irritation bubbling in her chest, Vivian nodded stiffly. "Of course, Margaret." As she moved toward the kitchen, her mind remained clouded with unanswered questions.

Margaret waited until Vivian was out of earshot before turning back to Adrian. Her voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. "I know all about what you've been keeping from your grandparents. I wanted to spare you embarrassment, which is why I called her back to speak privately. But since you followed her here, let's be clear. When do you plan to divorce her? If you're concerned about her wellbeing, give her Seabreeze Villa and five million in cash. That's more than enough for her to live comfortably forever."

Adrian's jaw tightened visibly. Margaret pressed on, her tone softening as if offering a peace treaty. "If you're worried about her future, just give her Seabreeze Villa and five million. That's generous by any standard."

"We're not getting divorced," Adrian stated flatly. "We had an argument - what couple doesn't? Even the strongest marriages hit rough patches." He leaned back against the sofa, his gaze drifting toward the kitchen. Through the doorway, he could see Vivian's slender frame moving with quiet efficiency. Her hands worked with practiced precision, skills honed through years of thankless domestic labor.

Margaret sighed, frustration flashing across her carefully maintained features. "Didn't you always prefer Serena? I'll admit I didn't care for her at first either, but she's clearly superior to Vivian in every way. Successful, independent, no messy family entanglements—"

"Mother," Adrian cut her off sharply. "Must you constantly interfere? Serena and I are finished. She's like a sister to me. Stop this ridiculous matchmaking."
###Chapter 318

Adrian's eyes turned to steel as they locked with Margaret's growing fury. After a tense silence, he exhaled sharply, forcing his voice into a gentler register though the undercurrent of annoyance persisted. "Vivian and I are actively trying for a baby. Can we please stop dredging up irrelevant history?"

Margaret's features froze momentarily, her anger dimming slightly though suspicion still clouded her gaze. She shot Bianca a sideways glance. "Is that your new strategy? Distract me with talk of grandchildren? Trying to silence me because I'm asking uncomfortable questions?"

Adrian stretched his muscular frame across the sofa with practiced ease. "Why would I fabricate something so easily disproven? In three months, the truth will be evident. Lying now would only create unnecessary complications later."

Bianca pouted, muttering under her breath, "Half the women in Crestwood would kill to bear your children. Why must it be her?"

One dark eyebrow arched in response. "Because she's my wife. Any child of hers would be the legitimate Blackwood heir. Offspring from other women would be bastards - a scandal that would tank Blackwood Group's stock price overnight."

Bianca huffed in frustration, strangling a throw pillow in her grip until she fell silent. Margaret's expression darkened. "Conception doesn't happen by wishing upon stars—"

Suddenly, her eyes lit with realization as she snatched up her phone, firing off a voice message. "Mrs. Harrington, do you still have those fertility supplements your daughter-in-law used?"

Adrian pinched the bridge of his nose. "Mother, do you honestly believe I need pharmaceutical assistance in that department?"

"What would you know about women's health?" Margaret kept her eyes glued to her screen. "They're not for you, they're for her. Coming from that backwater town, I worry about her nutritional deficiencies."

Adrian's gaze drifted toward the slender figure moving about the kitchen. She was painfully thin. If they were serious about starting a family, she'd need proper nourishment first.

"Dinner's served," Vivian announced as she emerged carrying a steaming bowl.

At the sight of Vivian, Bianca's appetite vanished. She tossed aside the pillow, muttered an excuse, and fled the penthouse.

Throughout the meal, Margaret displayed unprecedented kindness, heaping Vivian's plate with extra portions. Vivian shot Adrian a panicked look, silently begging for intervention.

"Eat up," Adrian said smoothly, shifting in his chair. His polished Oxford accidentally brushed against Vivian's bare calf beneath the table. Unable to resist, he let his foot linger, tracing idle circles against her skin.

Vivian glared daggers before discreetly scooting her chair away. If Margaret noticed, the blame would fall solely on her while Adrian would remain above reproach.

Adrian chewed methodically, maintaining perfect composure while pretending not to notice his wife's irritation.

"You need more meat on your bones," Margaret declared, ignoring their silent exchange, her concern genuine though her delivery remained stiff.

"I understand, Margaret," Vivian replied softly.

The remainder of the meal passed in strained silence. When Vivian moved to clear the dishes, Margaret waved her off. "Let the staff handle it. You two should retire early." Her tone brooked no argument.
###Chapter 319

Vivian turned away, her back facing them.

Adrian felt Margaret lean in close, her whisper barely audible. "What's gotten into your mother today?"

"Beats me," Adrian drawled, stretching his arms behind his head. His eyelids lifted lazily. "Since when did you develop a taste for discomfort? She's being pleasant for once."

Vivian aimed a playful kick at his shin with her slippered foot. "You're the one who enjoys suffering!"

The soft impact only made her toes throb painfully.

Just then, the front door opened. A sophisticated woman in designer attire entered, her arms laden with gift bags. Vivian watched as Margaret greeted their visitor with unexpected warmth.

"Mrs. Harrington, you shouldn't have gone through all this trouble."

"Nonsense," Mrs. Harrington replied, setting her parcels on the side table. "I needed the walk after dinner anyway."

She hesitated, fingers twisting the strap of her purse.

Though Margaret played the role of society wife, her marriage into the powerful Blackwood family had sharpened her instincts. She noticed the woman's discomfort immediately. Normally she'd pretend not to see, but tonight was different.

"Whatever it is, just say it," Margaret prompted gently. "We're practically family."

Mrs. Harrington's gaze darted toward Adrian and Vivian before lowering her voice. "It's about your family's... private gambling cruise. The authorities shut it down abruptly overseas..."

Vivian's breath caught.

A gambling cruise? Could that be the same one where she'd encountered Julian? Were the Blackwoods involved in illegal operations?

Her eyes sought Adrian's for answers. To her knowledge, the Blackwood Group strictly avoided any ventures tied to gambling or narcotics.

Adrian dabbed his mouth with a linen napkin, completely unruffled. "Not my division," he said simply. "I play by the rules."

Vivian decided not to press further. With the Blackwood family's sprawling empire, it wasn't surprising if some branches dabbled in gray areas.

Mrs. Harrington offered them an awkward smile. "Oh, Mr. Blackwood, I didn't realize you'd be joining us this evening."

Margaret smoothly intervened. "They were just leaving." She beckoned Vivian over. "Come here, dear."

Vivian approached with measured steps. "Good evening, Mrs. Harrington."

"You've grown even lovelier, Vivian," the woman replied with polite detachment.

Margaret pressed one of the gift bags into Vivian's hands. "These are for you."

Peeking inside, Vivian found an assortment of premium supplements. "What are they for?"

Mrs. Harrington's smile turned knowing. "The very best quality. Take them daily without fail."

"Of course," Vivian murmured, accepting the mysterious gift with both hands.
###Chapter 320

"Mom, Mrs. Harrington—"

"Vivian, we're leaving now," Adrian murmured as he approached her, effortlessly taking the designer tote from her shoulder while intertwining their fingers. Her delicate hand felt like silk against his palm, prompting him to give an unconscious squeeze.

Vivian offered a polite nod toward the sitting room before exiting. The fading voices carried Mrs. Harrington's bewildered whisper: "Since when did they become so intimate?" She couldn't care less about the gossip as Adrian guided her toward the driveway.

She abruptly withdrew her hand. "I'll take my own car."

Adrian glanced at their disconnected hands, lips quirking. "Don't be ridiculous. We're going together."

His phone chose that moment to ring. He checked the screen but let it vibrate unanswered, the caller ID flashing 'Serena Whitmore'. Vivian's gaze flickered to the display before she pointedly looked away, shoulders stiffening. After three rings, he finally answered.

"Adrian, have you eaten yet?" Serena's melodic voice floated through the speaker.

"I have. What do you need?" His tone softened noticeably.

Serena's playful pout was audible. "Can't I just call to—"

"We're at Blackwood Manor," he cut in, voice turning glacial.

Vivian seized the opportunity to stride toward her convertible, but Adrian caught her wrist mid-step. She shot him a withering look—did he expect her to stand there like some dutiful wife while he cooed at his ex? Just as she opened her mouth to protest, inspiration struck.

Fluttering her lashes, she purred, "Sweetheart, I'm exhausted. Could we continue this delightful conversation when we get home?"

Faking seduction came surprisingly easy.

Adrian's eyes darkened with something unreadable before he abruptly ended the call. "Nothing urgent, Serena. Rest well. We'll talk tomorrow."

The moment his phone disappeared into his pocket, their gazes locked.

Vivian crossed her arms. "Well? Going to chastise me now? Or perhaps you're upset I interrupted your tender moment with your precious, fragile ex?"

Every muscle in her body tensed like a coiled spring, ready to unleash a storm of accusations at the slightest provocation.

After a weighted pause, Adrian exhaled and reached for her. "You said you were tired. Why are you standing there like a cornered animal?"

She sidestepped his touch. "Don't deflect! What's your game here? Collecting grievances to use against me later?"

A smirk tugged at his lips. "Why would I scold you? For pretending to be tired? Do you really think I'd lose my temper over that?"

His expression grew contemplative. "Vivian, do you honestly see me as the villain in this story?"
###Chapter 321

The moonlight cast an enigmatic glow in Adrian's fathomless eyes.

Vivian stood frozen, her mind racing with unspoken questions. Was Adrian truly oblivious, or was this all an elaborate act?

Her earlier comment about exhaustion hadn't been casual. She'd deliberately made that pointed remark while he was on call with Serena. Where was his usual defense? Where was the immediate reprimand she'd come to expect? Vivian had openly challenged Serena's presence, yet Adrian remained uncharacteristically silent.

In the past, the slightest hint from Serena would have Adrian chastising Vivian without hesitation...

She parted her lips, then pressed them shut. Asking now would only reveal how much his behavior affected her. She couldn't give him that satisfaction.

With practiced indifference, Vivian yanked open the car door and slid inside without a word.

Through the window, she saw Adrian still standing motionless outside. Ignoring him, she pulled out her phone and texted Audrey: "Why the sudden change in behavior?"

Audrey's reply came instantly: "Classic reverse psychology."

"Keep playing hard to get. He'll come running."

Vivian scoffed at the unhelpful advice and pocketed her phone.

When she offered no reaction, Adrian finally entered the car. He opened his laptop, reviewing the investment portfolio Ethan had prepared earlier.

After a while, he slipped on black-rimmed glasses. Though his vision was perfect, they helped reduce screen glare. The frames transformed him - a dangerous predator masquerading as a scholar.

Vivian stole a glance. Contrary to popular belief about glasses diminishing attractiveness, they only enhanced Adrian's sophisticated allure. The laptop's glow reflected in his lenses, adding an air of mystery.

"I know I'm attractive," he said without looking up from the screen. "No need for covert glances."

Heat flooded Vivian's cheeks at being caught.

"Your ego is astounding," she snapped. "I was thinking you look like a pretentious academic."

Adrian merely smirked, refusing to rise to the bait.

Deflated by his indifference, Vivian leaned against the window and closed her eyes. The day's events - from the company visit to Blackwood Manor - had drained her completely.

Sleep claimed her almost instantly.

Finishing his work, Adrian removed his glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose. His gaze fell on Vivian's peaceful sleeping form. He shut the laptop and draped a blanket over her.

As she shifted, her cheek brushed against his hand. He couldn't resist tracing the curve of her face with his thumb. Her lips looked impossibly soft, like ripe fruit begging to be tasted.

Overcome, Adrian leaned down and pressed a featherlight kiss to the corner of her mouth.
###Chapter 322

The drive from Blackwood Manor to Seabreeze Villa was brief, with the sleek car gliding through the gated entrance before Vivian could fully wake from her doze. Ethan stepped out first, the crisp evening air rushing in as he opened the rear door.

Adrian caught his assistant's eye with a subtle shake of his head - a silent command to remain quiet.

Vivian stirred as Adrian lifted her, the plush velvet blanket slipping slightly. Her sudden movement nearly sent them both tumbling onto the gravel driveway.

"Easy," Adrian murmured, adjusting his grip. The blanket - an imported Azurevale wool worth fifteen thousand Sterlings - threatened to brush the ground. "Unless you want to explain stains to the dry cleaners?"

Vivian stilled, though her voice carried the rasp of exhaustion. "I'm awake. Put me down."

Gwendolyn stood waiting at the double doors, her practiced smile faltering slightly. In her months as Seabreeze Villa's head housekeeper, she'd witnessed Vivian's fiery temper and sharp tongue. Yet tonight, the woman lay docile in Adrian's arms, wrapped in luxury like some treasured possession.

Ethan extended a discreet package toward Gwendolyn. "Mrs. Harrington's special blend," he explained at her questioning look. "To be served warm before bed. Not during..." He trailed off meaningfully.

Adrian's voice cut through the night. "Make sure she drinks it every evening." His tone left no room for negotiation.

Inside the grand foyer, Vivian squirmed again. "Really, I can walk."

Adrian ignored her protests, carrying her up the sweeping staircase. Only when they reached the master suite did he finally set her on the tufted bench at the foot of their bed. His hands moved to the delicate straps of her heels.

Vivian jerked her feet away. "What are you doing?"

"Removing your shoes." Adrian's fingers paused midair. "Is this another small-town custom I should know about? Refusing basic courtesy?"

Vivian rolled her eyes, the motion sending her dark curls tumbling. "Basic courtesy? From the great Adrian Blackwood? Next you'll tell me you're tucking me in with a bedtime story."

A ghost of amusement crossed Adrian's features as he finally freed her from the designer heels. "Would you prefer Shakespeare or Brontë?"

The blanket pooled around Vivian like liquid silver as she stood, suddenly aware of Gwendolyn hovering in the doorway with the mysterious package. The housekeeper's gaze darted between them, calculating.

Vivian squared her shoulders. Small-town girl or not, she wouldn't be coddled like some fragile doll in front of the staff. Not when every whisper in this gilded cage carried straight to Serena Whitmore's eager ears.

"I'll take that," Vivian said, snatching the package from Gwendolyn's hands. The scent of exotic herbs wafted through the paper. "And I believe we're done for the evening?"

Gwendolyn's curtsey was picture-perfect. "Of course, Mrs. Blackwood."

The door clicked shut, leaving Vivian alone with the man who'd turned her life upside down - and the bitter tonic of a marriage neither had wanted.
###Chapter 323

"You should probably start adjusting to this arrangement," Adrian murmured, carefully placing her shoes by the dresser before settling beside her on the bed. His fingers traced absent circles on her thigh, radiating comforting heat.

The domestic intimacy of the moment made Vivian's breath hitch. She sprang up abruptly. "I need to get ready for bed."

Adrian didn't attempt to stop her.

Shrugging off his suit jacket, Adrian stretched across the silk sheets, supporting his head with one arm as his gaze followed her movements. "I'm staying tonight." The unspoken meaning hung between them - they would be sharing the bed.

Vivian paused mid-step, shoulders tensing as she whispered, "I'm really exhausted today."

Amusement flickered in Adrian's dark eyes as he promised, "Just sleeping."

His words sent an unexpected flush creeping up Vivian's neck. She cursed her traitorous body for reacting.

She practically fled to the ensuite bathroom.

Vivian took her sweet time with her nighttime ritual. She changed into satin pajamas, meticulously dried her hair with a towel, then lined up her skincare arsenal - hydrating mist, vitamin C serum, retinol eye cream, moisturizing lotion, and finally night cream.

Each step was performed with deliberate care before she killed another twenty minutes scrolling through social media on her phone.

When she finally emerged, Adrian was sprawled across the chaise lounge, one arm draped along the back, fingers pressed to his temple. His absurdly long lashes cast shadows on his cheekbones, giving him the appearance of some Renaissance sculpture - breathtaking yet untouchable.

Before Vivian could process the sight, a sharp knock interrupted her thoughts. "Mrs. Blackwood," came Gwendolyn's crisp voice through the door. "Your evening tonic."

At the sound, Adrian's eyes snapped open. He rubbed his temples, and Vivian couldn't tell if he'd been asleep or simply meditating.

"All done?" His voice was rough with sleep, that rich baritone doing unfair things to her pulse.

"Yes," Vivian answered quietly, moving to open the door.

Gwendolyn stood waiting with the customary porcelain bowl. Vivian took a tentative sip, her face immediately contorting at the bitter herbal taste.

"Too strong?" Adrian asked, suddenly beside her.

Feeling ridiculous for reacting like a child to medicine, Vivian shrugged. "It's fine. Just needs to cool down a bit."

Adrian's gaze dropped to the bowl.

Noticing the complete absence of steam, he reached out to test the temperature with his fingertips. The liquid was already tepid.

When Vivian realized her white lie had been exposed, her grip tightened on the bowl, fingers tracing the intricate gold filigree pattern nervously.

Adrian seemed to sense her discomfort. Producing a butterscotch candy from his pocket like some sort of magician, he offered it with a coaxing smile that made her feel sixteen again. "Take this with it. Drink it all at once - it'll be over faster."

Vivian accepted the candy, popped it between her lips, then downed the entire contents of the bowl in one dramatic swallow before handing the empty vessel back to Gwendolyn.

The housekeeper chuckled, a knowing glint in her eye. "Mr. Blackwood certainly knows how to pamper his wife."
###Chapter 324

Adrian's lips curved into a satisfied smirk as he gazed down at Vivian. "Pity some people don't recognize true value when they see it."

Gwendolyn froze mid-step, shocked to witness the usually aloof Mr. Blackwood engaging in such playful banter. Her eyes darted to the empty porcelain bowl. "I must admit, I'm intrigued. What exactly is this special brew?"

Vivian shot her a wary glance, remembering Gwendolyn's previous nosy questions about the tonic. Instead of responding, she stretched dramatically and yawned, deliberately changing the subject.

Noticing her evasion, Adrian's voice turned glacial. "You're dismissed."

"Yes, Mr. Blackwood." Gwendolyn practically tripped over herself in her haste to leave, the door clicking shut behind her with finality.

Adrian leaned against the doorframe with effortless grace, his partially unbuttoned shirt revealing just enough of his sculpted chest to be tantalizing. "I'm going to shower. Don't wait up - get some rest."

"Goodnight," Vivian murmured, averting her eyes as she moved toward the massive four-poster bed.

Without another word, Adrian disappeared into the ensuite bathroom.

Vivian slipped beneath the silk sheets, curling herself into the farthest corner of the mattress as if creating physical distance could calm her racing thoughts. She turned her back to the bathroom, listening to the muffled sound of running water.

Whether it was the nap in the car or the unsettling awareness of Adrian just feet away, sleep eluded her. Her mind kept conjuring vivid images - first of Adrian under the shower spray, then of far more intimate scenarios between them.

She tossed restlessly, her cheeks burning. At barely twenty-two, why were these feelings suddenly so intense?

After what felt like hours, exhaustion finally pulled her toward sleep.

Some time later, she barely registered the mattress dipping as Adrian slid in beside her. His strong arm wrapped possessively around her waist, pulling her close. Too tired to resist, she surrendered to sleep, his warmth lulling her into deeper slumber.

The next morning, Vivian awoke to her phone's persistent ringing. Still half-asleep, she reached blindly for her phone on the nightstand, only to grasp empty air.

Had Adrian already left?

She blinked sleepily at the undisturbed space beside her. The man operated on a different level of discipline entirely.

Shaking off the thought, she retrieved her phone from under the pillow. The caller ID showed a shareholder from Dawson Enterprises, and her notifications were flooded with messages from others eager to sell their shares.

A glance at the clock confirmed she had exactly eleven hours before her deadline. Swiftly forwarding the legal agreements her lawyers had prepared, she swung her legs over the edge of the bed.

Her bare feet sank into the plush carpet as she headed toward the bathroom to prepare for what promised to be a pivotal day.
###Chapter 325

The morning sunlight streamed through the bay windows as Vivian finished her skincare routine. A lavish lunch had already been laid out in the dining room, where Adrian sat scrolling through stock charts on his tablet, his brow furrowed in concentration.

She pulled out the chair opposite him, the legs scraping softly against the marble floor.

Adrian didn’t glance up. "Did the board contact you?"

Vivian’s fingers tightened around her water glass. "What did you do this time?"

With a lazy stretch, Adrian reached for his cigarette case, extracting one with practiced ease.

Ethan strode in just then, amusement dancing in his eyes. "Mrs. Blackwood, check Crestwood’s latest headlines. Everything will make sense."

Sighing, Vivian unlocked her phone. A breaking news alert flashed across the screen.

The article detailed the spectacular collapse of a once-reputable company, swindled by a fraudulent supplier now under federal investigation. Speculations ran wild—corporate espionage, insider betrayal. The Dawson family’s buried scandal had erupted into public scrutiny, their name dragged through the mud.

There was no doubt in Vivian’s mind who’d orchestrated this.

She met Adrian’s gaze. "Thank you."

Adrian lit his cigarette, the flame briefly illuminating his sharp features. Smoke curled between them as he exhaled, veiling his expression. His fingers tapped the cigarette against the ashtray, the motion elegant, deliberate. A smirk played at his lips. "That’s it? A half-hearted ‘thank you’?"

Vivian arched a brow. "What exactly are you expecting?"

Adrian leaned back, leaving the question hanging.

Ethan wiped his brow, mentally cursing Adrian’s indirect approach. The man had just dismantled Vivian’s family’s enemies with surgical precision—yet here he was, dodging the real conversation.

Adrian stretched his legs beneath the table. "Come with me to Sapphire Springs when you’re free. I need a break."

Ethan shot him an exasperated look. Always the deflection.

Vivian’s first instinct was to say, "Why not take Serena?" But her thumb brushed the still-open article on her phone. The weight of what he’d done settled over her.

She tightened her grip on the device. "Fine."

A beat of silence. Then she lifted her chin, voice steady. "Adrian, don’t you think this charade between us has gone on long enough?"

Adrian’s jaw clenched. The ember of his cigarette pulsed, then dimmed—like the fragile thread between them. He stubbed it out violently. "You agreed. See it through."

He still refused to look at her.

The tension shattered when Gwendolyn entered, balancing a tray of desserts. She hesitated, sensing the storm in the room. "Ma’am, forgive the interruption, but..."

Her voice trailed off, uncertain.

The air thickened, charged with everything left unsaid.
###Chapter 326

Vivian's expression remained inscrutable. "If you have something to say, just say it."

Gwendolyn hesitated, weighing her words carefully. "Madam, Mr. Blackwood has been exceptionally generous with you. You should show more gratitude. There was a Ms. Whitmore who used to visit frequently. Mr. Blackwood treated her with such devotion, and she never failed to express her appreciation. She considered herself blessed to know him. You could learn from her example. He's an extraordinary man. If you don't value him, others certainly will."

Her words dripped with thinly veiled sarcasm, masquerading as concern while clearly designed to undermine Vivian. The implication was clear - unlike Serena, Vivian failed to recognize Adrian's worth.

Vivian arched one perfectly shaped eyebrow, offering Gwendolyn a knowing half-smile. "Since Ms. Whitmore is such a paragon of virtue, perhaps you should suggest to Mr. Blackwood that he find himself a new wife? Someone exactly like your description of Ms. Whitmore?"

Gwendolyn's mouth fell open, her rehearsed speech dying in her throat.

This wasn't the reaction she'd anticipated. She'd deliberately mentioned Serena to provoke insecurity in Vivian, hoping to trigger jealous behavior that would alienate Adrian. Instead, Vivian had turned the tables with alarming ease.

She'd practically suggested Adrian replace her with Serena.

While this was exactly what Gwendolyn wanted, she could never voice such thoughts directly. Where did this supposed nobody get such audacity?

Was Vivian truly this confident? This unconcerned about leaving the Blackwood family? Had she found someone to replace Adrian? But who in Crestwood could possibly compare to Adrian's wealth, power, and striking looks?

The more Gwendolyn puzzled over it, the more confused she became.

"Keep your opinions to yourself in the future," Adrian interjected smoothly before Vivian could respond, his voice devoid of inflection.

Chastened, Gwendolyn lightly slapped her own wrist. "I overstepped. My apologies. I only want Mr. and Mrs. Blackwood to have a harmonious marriage—"

Before she could complete her thought, Adrian fixed her with an icy stare. "There is only one Mrs. Blackwood. Don't involve outsiders in my personal affairs."

His tone carried unmistakable finality this time, like a royal decree.

"Yes, Mr. Blackwood," Gwendolyn mumbled, bowing her head and twisting her cleaning cloth nervously, too intimidated to argue further.

"You may leave," he dismissed her with a wave.

Relieved, Gwendolyn exhaled quietly and scurried back toward the kitchen.

Vivian studied Adrian with undisguised astonishment. This marked the second time he'd defended her against Serena. She couldn't decipher his motives. Was this genuine remorse, or another tactic to cloud her judgment and prevent their divorce?

He wanted her to play the devoted wife, yet couldn't seem to sever ties with Serena completely.

As Vivian pondered this, her phone vibrated. Damien Vaughn's name illuminated the screen.

Adrian glimpsed the caller ID and smirked. "You two seem... unusually close," he remarked, his tone teasing yet edged with something darker. The upward inflection made it sound more like an accusation than a question.
###Chapter 327

Vivian exhaled sharply, her fingers tightening around her phone. "It's just business," she said through gritted teeth.

Adrian's lips curled into a sardonic smile. "Is Ivory Phoenix Productions understaffed? Or do you enjoy conducting personal negotiations with Mr. Vaughn?"

With an irritated huff, Vivian moved to the far corner of the room before answering the call.

She perched on the edge of an armchair, phone pressed to her ear.

Damien's smooth voice carried through the line. "Have you had dinner? I'd love to take you out."

"Already ate," Vivian replied, her gaze drifting to Adrian. He sat at the dining table, cutting his steak with precise movements. Even in his haste, every motion carried an effortless grace that made the simple act of eating look like a performance.

The phrase "easy on the eyes" suddenly made perfect sense.

Damien's voice snapped her back to reality. "There's a reality show filming this weekend. They need a guest for one episode. What do you think?"

Vivian's brows knitted together. "Is this promotion for the new drama? Shouldn't Sebastian be the one doing this?"

Since she wasn't officially signed with Ivory Phoenix, appearing on unrelated shows seemed unnecessary.

"No," Damien clarified. "This is purely for exposure. Your screen presence could win you fans. Right now, you're vulnerable to online attacks without a solid fanbase. This could help shape your public image."

Vivian had considered this before. While acting remained her passion, avoiding the spotlight entirely might hinder her career growth.

Yet after weathering multiple scandals, staying low-key felt safer.

"I think I should maintain my current approach," she said firmly.

"Sounds like a perfect opportunity," a deep voice interjected unexpectedly.

Vivian startled, looking up to find Adrian looming over her.

His proximity allowed Damien to hear him clearly. "Is that Adrian Blackwood with you?"

"Yes," Vivian admitted through clenched teeth.

Adrian's expression remained impassive as he spoke. "You can't avoid the public forever."

Covering the receiver, Vivian shot him a withering glare.

Adrian merely arched an eyebrow. "What? Am I lying?"

"I have to go. My decision stands," Vivian said abruptly before ending the call.

She turned to Adrian, eyes blazing. "Did you really need to humiliate me in front of my employer?"

Adrian's expression darkened. "You think that's why I spoke up?"
###Chapter 328

"Did you really?" Vivian countered, turning her face away as she rose and moved toward the dining table. "You've never approved of my decision to pursue acting."

Adrian remained sprawled across the sofa, his long legs stretched out, watching her retreating figure with sharp eyes. "If you're serious about this career, you can't just hide from challenges like some frightened rabbit."

"The public has a short memory. For someone like me—small, insignificant—any scandal will fade if I stay silent. Why provoke more attention now?" Vivian settled into her chair and idly picked up a prawn.

Adrian lit a cigarette, the glow illuminating his fingers in the dim light. "Silence makes you look weak. They'll only push harder. The only way is to stand firm and show them you won't be bullied."

This was clearly Adrian's business-world philosophy. But would he still feel the same if he knew Serena was behind her troubles?

Vivian hesitated briefly, keeping her gaze lowered, avoiding his.

She continued eating quietly, lost in thought, offering no response.

Adrian took a deep drag, letting the smoke curl between them before speaking in a low, edged tone. "I can get you some auditions."

Distracted, Vivian barely caught the tension in his voice. She shrugged carelessly. "Not necessary."

Adrian's eyes darkened as he leaned forward. "Why? You'd rather take whatever scraps Damien throws your way? You're not even signed to Ivory Phoenix. Does he have nothing better to do than chase modeling gigs for an actress?"

A spark of something dangerous flickered in his gaze. "No wonder they'll always be second-rate."

Vivian remained silent, her expression distant, as if his words hadn't registered.

Adrian studied her for a long moment before exhaling sharply. With precise movements, he stubbed out his cigarette, the ember dying beneath his fingers.

He stood abruptly, grabbing his coat as he moved toward the door, the fabric whispering against the chair.

Vivian's eyes followed him briefly. Her lips parted slightly—words unspoken.

But before she could speak, Adrian was already gone, the door clicking shut behind him.

She stared at the closed door before returning to her meal, the clink of cutlery the only sound in the quiet apartment.

Lately, she'd been avoiding Adrian almost instinctively. Every interaction felt precarious, like walking on thin ice.

The divorce discussion had faded somewhat, but its shadow still loomed over her.

She feared her hard-won resolve might crumble before she could regain control.

After finishing her meal, Vivian remembered the script outline she'd completed. She decided to visit Ivory Phoenix Productions directly to pitch it to their development team.
###Chapter 329

The revelation of Vivian Hartley's true identity eliminated the need for intermediaries at Ivory Phoenix Productions. Face-to-face collaboration would allow her to refine concepts with direct team input, incorporating diverse perspectives into her creative process.

This was a golden opportunity to blend her artistic vision with commercial viability.

Vivian's first visit to the planning department caused an immediate stir. Staff members who'd imagined "Vivian Hartley" as some middle-aged male recluse now gaped openly. Even surrounded by celebrities daily, her natural beauty stood out.

Without cosmetics, her flawless complexion and delicate features appeared sculpted from marble. Dressed simply in distressed jeans and a cropped white tee, her high ponytail completed the effortlessly chic look of a college coed rather than a literary sensation.

"Ms. Dawson," a junior editor stammered, "could we discuss some nuances from your last novel?"

Vivian flashed an easy smile. "Absolutely. My afternoon's clear." She perched casually on an office chair, radiating approachability.

The team scrambled to arrange seating, notebooks at the ready.

Then Vivian abruptly stood.

Silence fell as she crossed to the water cooler, filled a paper cup, and returned to her seat.

Flushed with embarrassment at their oversight, staff members ducked behind laptops and notepads. Vivian merely sipped her water. "Let's focus on the new project first. We can analyze older works later."

The session unfolded beautifully, revealing layers of complexity in Vivian's writing that previous email exchanges had missed. Her ability to weave subtle symbolism into commercial fiction particularly impressed them.

But beyond talent, her demeanor captivated the team. Unlike the aloof genius they'd envisioned, Vivian engaged even the greenest intern with genuine interest. When discussing plot points, she listened as intently as she spoke, making each contributor feel valued.

By meeting's end, the staff had transitioned from admiring the pseudonym to respecting the woman behind it.

Unnoticed through the glass partition, icy eyes tracked Vivian's every movement from the lounge area.

As the clock struck four, enthusiasm showed no signs of waning. Left unchecked, this might evolve into dinner plans and late-night brainstorming.

Vivian gracefully intervened. "Let's pause here. I'll be visiting regularly now that the cat's out of the bag." She gathered her bag with finality. "Family obligations call."

Her strategic phrasing neatly preempted any social extensions.

The unseen observer's lips curled as Vivian exited.
###Chapter 330

The farewells dragged on with forced politeness. Knowing Adrian's luxury cars would draw too much attention, Vivian opted for a taxi instead. After exiting Ivory Phoenix Productions, she stood curbside scrolling through her ride-hailing app.

Tires screeched without warning.

Vivian's head snapped up to see a sedan barreling toward her. Her breath caught as time seemed to slow - the chrome grille mere feet away. Survival instincts kicked in, sending her stumbling backward.

The car halted with a violent shudder, its bumper grazing her knees. Vivian landed hard on the pavement, palms scraping concrete.

As she caught her breath, a battered BMW's door swung open. A woman in oversized sunglasses emerged. "Ms. Hartley, I presume? Not hurt, are we?" Her voice dripped with false concern laced with venom.

Vivian rose gracefully, brushing gravel from her slacks. "Do I know you?"

"Hardly. When I was booking lead roles, you were probably still sleeping your way to the top." The woman removed her shades, revealing over-plumped lips and unnaturally smooth cheeks.

Vivian's gaze turned arctic. "First reckless endangerment, now slander. Quite the repertoire."

A stray lock of hair framed Vivian's sharp cheekbones, accentuating her unshakable composure. Where others might appear disheveled, she radiated lethal poise that made the woman falter.

The stranger's smirk wavered before she forced a laugh. "Such dramatic accusations! New driver mistake - gas instead of brake. You're perfectly intact."

"You keep using my name while claiming we're strangers." Vivian checked her watch. "Either state your business or get out of my way."

Leaning in, Vivian's whisper carried the weight of a guillotine blade. "This is your one free pass. Try again, and I'll collect both debts with interest."

The woman recoiled as if struck, her bravado crumbling under Vivian's predator's gaze. For a heartbeat, she glimpsed something ancient and ruthless behind those cool eyes.

Regaining footing, the woman spat her grievances. "Do you know how many auditions I've bombed while you waltz onto sets? No connections, no favors - just raw talent. And now you steal my variety show spot? When will your greed be satisfied?"

The puzzle clicked. Damien Vaughn's recent offer - this woman's lost opportunity. Not that it excused today's stunt. Even if Vivian had accepted, this wasn't justice; it was petty vengeance.

Adrian's advice echoed in her mind: Some wolves only understand fangs. The entertainment jungle had no mercy for prey.

Decision made, Vivian tapped her phone. "Mr. Vaughn? About that variety show - I'm in."

Her smile as she ended the call would've frozen hell over. Let the games begin.
###Chapter 331

Damien Vaughn's voice crackled through the phone, laced with surprise and curiosity. "Hmm? What made you change your mind so suddenly? Is this about Adrian?"

Vivian Hartley's grip tightened around her phone.

Nearby, the woman with obvious cosmetic enhancements caught snippets of the conversation, her eyes widening in shock.

"Mr. Vaughn..." she whispered under her breath, her voice trembling with disbelief. She hadn't anticipated Vivian making such a bold move and panic surged through her, terrified Vivian might reveal something to Damien.

Vivian could feel the tension thickening around them, the woman's anxiety almost tangible. She had no intention of dragging Adrian into this conversation, especially not with this woman listening in.

"We'll discuss this later," Vivian said abruptly, ending the call before Damien could pry further.

The woman exhaled sharply in relief. But her momentary comfort shattered when she remembered Vivian's earlier declaration about joining the reality show.

The realization struck her like lightning. "You—you—" she stammered, her voice faltering.

Vivian absently twirled her phone between her fingers, a ghost of a smile playing on her lips. She met the woman's anxious gaze with cool indifference.

"I never had any intention of joining that show," she said evenly. "But—"

Vivian deliberately drew out the word, watching the woman squirm before continuing in a deceptively casual tone. "Since you're convinced I stole your opportunity and decided to pull this pathetic intimidation stunt today, there's no taking it back now. If I back out, doesn't that mean I'll be admitting guilt for something I didn't do?"

The woman's earlier bravado crumbled.

She bit her lower lip hard enough to leave marks, her eyes dropping to the floor. "I—I'm sorry," she muttered, though her apology rang hollow, her eyes burning with barely concealed resentment.

Vivian had dealt with enough fake apologies to recognize one instantly. The woman's lack of genuine remorse only strengthened her resolve.

Unmoved, Vivian abruptly stopped twirling her phone. She dropped it into her bag with a decisive motion, her gaze icy. "Do you honestly think an apology fixes anything?"

The woman hesitated, but her pride wouldn't let her surrender completely. She switched tactics, searching for leverage. "If you never wanted to be on the show, you must have your reasons. You don't have to do this just because of me, right?"

Vivian's lips curved slightly as she pinned the woman with an unwavering stare. "Why not? Why should I pretend to be the bigger person?" Her voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "I'm petty. And I don't forget."

Vivian shrugged nonchalantly, a silent challenge flashing in her eyes.

Before the woman could respond, a sleek black car pulled up, its engine purring to a stop. Vivian glanced at the license plate, confirming it was hers. Without hesitation, she strode past the stunned woman and slid into the backseat.

As the door closed, she rolled down the window one last time. "Drop the amateur theatrics," she said, her voice deceptively soft. "Even if there are no witnesses now, you know I have resources. Obtaining surveillance footage wouldn't be difficult."

Before the woman could react, Vivian's car was already merging into traffic, disappearing around the corner.
###Chapter 332

Vivian's parting words, meant only to unsettle her, had struck deeper than intended.

As the car disappeared down the road, the woman's gaze remained fixed on the empty street. Her mind whirled with sudden clarity as Damien's earlier words replayed in her memory.

He had mentioned someone named Adrian. That name rang a bell.

A sharp realization pierced through her. Adrian—wasn't he Serena's mysterious patron? So Adrian was Vivian's powerful backer?

A slow, calculating smile spread across her lips. The earlier panic dissolved into something far more dangerous. Vivian had unknowingly handed her a weapon—one that required no direct action from her. Others would handle Vivian for her.

The woman's thoughts raced back to when she'd worked with Serena on that period drama, when they'd exchanged contact information.

Her phone was already in her hand. Fingers flew across the screen as she typed: "Serena, just met someone named Vivian. She got Mr. Blackwood to secure her a spot on Spotlight Night."

Meanwhile, Vivian sat quietly in the backseat of the car, trying to shake off the unpleasant encounter. Compared to the storm of drama she'd recently survived, this felt like a minor irritation—hardly worth her attention.

To distract herself, she scrolled through social media. A post from Ivory Phoenix Productions caught her eye—a call for new script submissions.

It reminded her sharply of her own stalled writing project. While Lydia's latest venture was already in pre-production, her screenplay seemed indefinitely postponed.

She couldn't afford to lose momentum, not for some fleeting commercial project.

Her fingers hovered over the messaging app before typing: "Any updates on when we can resume the script? The longer we wait, the more continuity issues might arise."

The reply came after an agonizing pause: "Still waiting for client confirmation."

Vivian bit her lip, resisting the urge to press further. This deal had been arranged through Lydia's connections, and she wouldn't jeopardize her friend's position.

Closing the app, she told herself to focus on acting and creative work. Financial stability would solve everything—or so she desperately hoped.

If only she hadn't wasted those years as a housewife, setting aside all her ambitions.

Across town at Ivory Phoenix Productions, tension hung thick in the air. Serena's sudden withdrawal had left the entire project in limbo. Without her final payment, production couldn't proceed.

The studio head ran a hand through his thinning hair and typed a message mirroring Vivian's concern: "Ms. Whitmore, when can we expect to continue the scriptwriting?"

The message sat unanswered, the blinking cursor a silent accusation.

Minutes stretched into hours.

Still no reply.
###Chapter 333

The fluorescent lights of the hospital corridor cast sterile shadows as Adrian Blackwood set down the medical chart. His gaze drifted to Serena Whitmore, whose fingers flew across her phone screen with intense concentration.

"What's captured your attention so thoroughly?" Adrian's deep voice held amusement as he leaned against the counter.

Serena's manicured nails swiped left, closing the messaging app with practiced ease. She pulled up an exclusive auction platform, her eyes gleaming with excitement. "Crestwood Galleries is hosting a private auction tonight. Look at this breathtaking necklace."

She tilted the screen toward him, her usual sharp features softening into a coy smile. The diamond choker shimmered under the display lights, its ribbon-like design studded with stones that mimicked celestial constellations.

Adrian barely glanced at the jewelry. "If it pleases you, have my assistant place a bid." His tone was dismissive as his attention wandered to the far corner of the room.

There stood a crystal grand piano, its transparent surface catching the light like frozen starlight. The instrument seemed transported from some enchanted realm.

Serena followed his gaze and gasped. "That's the piano from Eternal Melody! The one where the heroine played the theme song during the rain scene."

Eternal Melody. A promise of forever.

As Serena chattered about the film's romantic climax, Adrian's mind conjured a different image - a slender figure with graceful fingers dancing across those same keys, creating magic with every touch.

Meanwhile, across town, Vivian Hartley emerged from Dawson Enterprises' headquarters, a leather portfolio clutched tightly in her hands. The signed contracts within represented her hard-won victory - 45% of the company's shares now rested under her control. More than double what her mother had ever held.

The night air carried the scent of impending rain as she hailed a cab. One bright star pierced through the urban light pollution, and Vivian allowed herself to believe it might be her mother's approving gaze from beyond.

When the taxi pulled up to Seabreeze Villa, the scene resembled a military operation. Workers in protective gloves maneuvered an enormous crate through the wrought-iron gates under Ethan Caldwell's watchful supervision.

"Mrs. Blackwood," Ethan greeted with a slight bow. "Mr. Blackwood's latest gift has arrived."

Vivian's lips pressed into a thin line. Adrian's gifts typically fell into predictable categories - glittering baubles meant to dazzle but never to truly see her. What impersonal luxury awaited her this time?

The crate loomed like a silent question between them. Whatever lay inside would change everything.
###Chapter 334

This was... unexpected.

"What could it be?" Vivian asked, tilting her head as she studied the massive crate being wheeled into the foyer.

Adrian's lips curled into that infuriatingly confident smirk. "Patience, darling. The reveal will be worth it."

She trailed behind the movers as they carefully navigated the priceless cargo through the marble archway. When they finally pried open the wooden container, her breath hitched.

There it stood - a breathtaking crystal grand piano, its faceted surface catching the afternoon light like a thousand diamonds. The instrument seemed to glow from within, casting prismatic patterns across the walls.

Her fingers flew to her lips. "The piano from Eternal Melody?"

Ethan nodded, clearly pleased with her recognition. "It was the highlight of today's auction in Crestwood. Mr. Blackwood insisted on acquiring it for you."

Vivian approached slowly, her fingertips ghosting over the cool, smooth surface. Each facet told a story, each reflection held a memory from the iconic film that had shaped her teenage years.

Though she'd never mastered more than basic scales, she'd always dreamed of owning such an instrument. Especially one so steeped in cinematic history.

Ethan, observing her reaction, added with quiet pride, "Mr. Blackwood recalled your childhood piano lessons. When this came up for bid, he didn't hesitate."

Her hand stilled mid-caress. A peculiar weight settled in her chest, dimming the initial spark of joy.

"I see," she murmured, her voice distant.

Adrian didn't know.

The film's tragic love story played through her mind like an old newsreel. The male protagonist had braved war zones to retrieve this very piano, only to perish before delivering it. His final wish? That it reach his beloved as a testament to their eternal bond.

To Vivian, this wasn't just an instrument - it was a symbol of love that defied death itself. To Adrian? Likely just another shiny object to add to his collection.

A soft sigh escaped her lips. Without its history, the gift felt... empty.

"Not the reaction I expected from such an extravagant present." Adrian's rich baritone vibrated against her back.

Vivian startled.

Before she could turn, his arms encircled her waist, pulling her against his solid frame with practiced ease.

She schooled her features into polite neutrality before facing him. "It's too much," she said evenly.

Adrian stood close enough that she could smell the crisp bergamot of his aftershave. Droplets from his recent shower still glistened in his dark hair, which fell carelessly across his forehead.

"Value is subjective," he countered smoothly. "At its core, it's just wood and strings."

Exactly as she'd thought.

###Chapter 335

A sharp ache pierced Vivian's chest as the truth settled in. To Adrian, this wasn't a token of affection or romance. It was simply another possession—a glittering testament to his influence and fortune.

The sound of footsteps interrupted her thoughts. Gwendolyn emerged from the kitchen, drying her hands on a linen towel. Her eyes landed on the grand piano, widening with undisguised avarice.

"A crystal piano?" she gasped, her voice trembling with barely contained excitement. "What's the price tag on something like that?"

Ethan hesitated, visibly reluctant to indulge Gwendolyn's prying. Then, spotting an opportunity to showcase Adrian's devotion, he turned to Vivian.

"The opening bid was forty million," he said respectfully. "But it finally sold for one hundred twenty million. Several prominent families were competing, but when they realized Mr. Blackwood was bidding..."

His words trailed off meaningfully. No one dared challenge Adrian's financial dominance. Auction items became his the moment he desired them. Others would place polite bids before withdrawing—a calculated show of deference to the Blackwood empire.

Gwendolyn's mouth fell open. "One hundred twenty million?" she shrieked, scrambling for her phone.

She snapped several photos, muttering, "My son won't believe his eyes."

"How could anyone spend that much on..." Her voice dropped to an envious whisper.

Adrian's expression darkened, irritation flashing across his features.

Ethan swiftly intervened. "That will be all," he told Gwendolyn firmly.

Adrian turned to Vivian, his voice softening. "Would you like to play?"

Vivian hesitated, then gave a small nod.

She approached the magnificent instrument, fingertips grazing the flawless keys. The resulting notes rang out with crystalline purity, each tone resonating with perfect clarity. It was breathtaking.

For a fleeting moment, she allowed herself to admire the craftsmanship, pushing aside the complicated emotions tied to this extravagant gift. After all, she wouldn't keep it after their arrangement ended. She might as well appreciate this masterpiece while she could.

Drawing a steadying breath, Vivian positioned her hands. She'd intended to play "Eternal Melody," but the moment demanded something different.

Instead, her fingers found a haunting wartime composition—a melancholic piece brimming with sorrow and sacrifice. The mournful notes painted vivid imagery of a fallen city at dusk, its crumbling structures standing as silent witnesses to devastation.

The music hung heavy in the air, stirring profound emotion in all who heard it.

A stunned silence followed the final, lingering note.

"That was extraordinary, Mrs. Blackwood! Simply masterful!" Ethan applauded enthusiastically.

Adrian nodded, his gaze never leaving Vivian. "Beautiful," he murmured.

"It carries such tragic majesty—" Ethan began analyzing the piece's somber tones but abruptly stopped, casting a nervous glance at Adrian.

Clearing his throat, he muttered, "I should return to the office."

With that, he made a hasty exit from Seabreeze Villa.
###Chapter 336

Adrian hadn't been listening to the music.

His attention had wandered, fixated on the delicate slope of Vivian's neck. Desire coiled low in his stomach, and he shifted closer, settling beside her on the piano bench.

His arm slid around her waist, fingers tracing idle patterns against her skin. His voice was rough, barely above a whisper. "Do you like it?"

Vivian remained still for a beat before answering softly, "I do."

"How are you going to thank me?" he murmured, lips grazing the shell of her ear. The suggestion was unmistakable.

She turned, pressing a kiss to the corner of his mouth. It wasn’t for the piano—it was for the company shares. Without Adrian’s intervention, she never would’ve secured them so effortlessly. Dawson Enterprises would’ve collapsed before she could gather the resources to save it.

"Thank you," she said quietly, an uncharacteristic sincerity lacing her words. "For helping with the company, too."

Her unexpected gratitude seemed to catch him off guard. He studied her, his hand lingering possessively on her waist.

"Let’s go upstairs," Vivian whispered, leaning into him.

Though desire burned beneath his skin, Adrian hesitated. Gwendolyn was still in the house, and he wasn’t one for an audience. Instead, he exhaled sharply, lifting Vivian effortlessly into his arms and carrying her upstairs.

That night, she surprised him.

Her movements were tentative, unpracticed, but there was an earnestness in her touch that Adrian found unexpectedly intoxicating. She fumbled, yet the quiet determination in her gaze stirred something deeper within him.

For once, Adrian restrained himself. Gone was his usual commanding demeanor, replaced by a rare patience and tenderness. The night unfolded differently—slow, deliberate, and strangely intimate.

Afterward, Vivian lay sprawled across the bed, her body limp with exhaustion. Her arm draped over the pillow, cheek pressed against the cool fabric. Damp tendrils of hair clung to her flushed face.

Adrian sat beside her, bare-chested, his presence radiating quiet dominance. He lit a cigarette, the flicker of the flame briefly illuminating his sharp features. Smoke curled lazily from his lips as his gaze settled on her.

The sight of her—vulnerable and unguarded—sent a ripple of satisfaction through him.

Vivian stirred slightly, her nose wrinkling at the faint scent of smoke. She’d always hated the habit, but watching him now—his movements deliberate, unhurried—she couldn’t deny the way it suited him. It twisted something in her stomach, a feeling she refused to name.

"Why did you suddenly change your mind about the reality show?" he asked, exhaling a slow stream of smoke.

Vivian blinked, momentarily caught off guard. It wasn’t surprising that he knew—Adrian had the means to uncover anything he wanted. What startled her was that he cared enough to ask.

In the past, even if she’d told him outright, she doubted he would’ve reacted.

"The show approached Blackwood Group for sponsorship," he said casually, as if reading her thoughts. "Your name came up in the guest list."

What he didn’t mention was the truth—that he’d specifically instructed Ethan to investigate her schedule after hearing whispers of her reconsideration. Upon confirming it, he’d personally ensured Blackwood Group would sponsor the show. But he wouldn’t admit that. Saying it aloud felt dangerously close to begging for her acknowledgment. He preferred she read between the lines.

###Chapter 337

Vivian gave a casual nod. "That tracks," she murmured under her breath.

It was standard practice for Blackwood Group to sponsor multiple reality shows annually. Truth be told, their initial foray into entertainment sponsorships had been because of Serena.

Adrian stubbed out his cigarette in the crystal ashtray, his mind drifting to earlier that evening. The grand piano had been a strategic gift, one that had elicited her rare excitement. Now that he'd dropped the sponsorship hint, he felt entitled to some reciprocation.

He shifted closer, his fingers tracing lazy circles on her bare arm. "Sweetheart," he coaxed in that velvet voice that usually melted her resistance. "Take the lead tonight."

His eyes held that dangerous glint - half challenge, half promise. He wanted to see what she'd learned, how she'd respond when given control.

But Vivian surprised him. She recoiled like she'd been burned, scrambling off the bed with uncharacteristic haste. Her silk nightgown whispered against her skin as she pulled it on.

"I'm exhausted," she declared, tying the sash with sharp movements. "And starving. I'm going downstairs for food."

Adrian's gaze lingered on the faint red marks marring her thighs - his marks. Heat coiled low in his abdomen. "One more round," he bargained, voice rough with want. "I'll have Gwendolyn bring you a tray."

Vivian didn't pause as she stepped into her lounge pants. "Not happening."

She dressed with frantic efficiency, like the room had suddenly become toxic. Without so much as a backward glance, she slipped through the door, leaving him alone with his frustration.

Adrian slumped against the headboard, exhaling sharply through his nose. He pressed his tongue against his canine, staring at the closed door with simmering irritation.

This was classic Vivian. Always retreating after getting what she wanted, leaving him unraveled and wanting more.

One hour earlier.

In the gilded spa suite of Harbor Grand Hotel, Serena lounged on a velvet chaise, twisting the diamond bracelet around her wrist. Another extravagant gift from Adrian.

Miranda, perched on a nearby ottoman, let out an appreciative whistle. "That's obscenely gorgeous," she gushed. "You'll be the undisputed queen of Spotlight Night, Serena. The other women won't stand a chance."

A junior aesthetician chimed in, eyes wide with envy. "Eight million sterling! Ms. Whitmore, you're living every woman's fantasy. To receive something like this without even hinting... your luck is unreal."

Serena's lips curved in a practiced, demure smile. "It's really nothing," she demurred, though pride flickered in her eyes. "I heard the auction's real showstopper was some hundred-million-sterling piano."

Her phone vibrated on the side table. When she glanced at the screen, her carefully constructed composure fractured. The image showed Vivian seated at the legendary piano from Eternal Melody, her fingers poised above the ivory keys.

The much-anticipated premiere of Vivian's variety show had finally arrived. Among the panelists, two were relatively unknown, but the third - Julian Montoya, Vivian's longtime friend - brought considerable star power. Julian's unfiltered honesty and raw acting talent had earned him a devoted following.

Clips of Julian's most candid moments, expertly edited by the marketing team, were already going viral, further boosting the show's visibility.
###Chapter 338

The recent collaboration between Julian Montoya and Serena Whitmore had become the talk of the town, injecting fresh excitement into the entertainment scene.

Lydia Bennett had originally planned to accompany Vivian Hartley for her debut variety show appearance, but an unexpected scheduling conflict with another artist under her management forced her to cancel. Knowing Julian would be present eased Lydia's concerns, though she still reminded Vivian to call if anything urgent arose.

Inside the bustling television studio, Cassandra Blake - a newcomer to variety shows but a seasoned internet celebrity - commanded the best dressing room. When she first contacted Serena, it was merely to discuss managing Vivian. Yet Serena, ever the generous soul, not only handled the situation but also secured Cassandra a guest spot on the show.

This unexpected favor left Cassandra with mixed feelings. She recognized how effortlessly doors opened when one had powerful connections - something she'd struggled to obtain through her own efforts.

The production crew buzzed around Cassandra, having been informed she was connected to a major sponsor. They'd received strict instructions to treat her with special care.

Arriving in a Blackwood Group vehicle, Cassandra had been a last-minute addition to the lineup.

Mistaken for the sponsor's connection, Cassandra found herself showered with compliments.

"Cassandra, you're absolutely radiant! Your complexion is flawless."

"Thanks to you, we've secured incredible sponsorship gifts for everyone today."

"I heard they've brought in a Michelin-starred chef just for your segment!"

Cassandra quickly corrected them. "Please don't misunderstand. I have no special connections here. All credit goes to Serena Whitmore - her boyfriend is the sponsor, and she's always looking out for her friends."

No longer naive, Cassandra understood Serena's help came with strings attached. Clearly, Serena intended to use her as a pawn to expose Vivian's relationship with Adrian Blackwood.

Observing the empty flattery, Julian felt increasingly uncomfortable. He seized the chance to move toward the entrance just as Vivian stepped off the elevator. His steps quickened toward her as if drawn by a lifeline.

"Vivian."

A gentle smile touched Vivian's lips when she spotted him. "I'm so relieved you're here."

Julian chuckled softly. "You've got both beauty and brains. Just be yourself - no need to stress. Remember, it's all fun and games today."

Leaning closer, he whispered, "We've got an unexpected guest today - Cassandra Blake."

Vivian's head tilted curiously as she scanned the room. "Of all people... why her?"

Fate certainly had a way of bringing rivals together. Cassandra, the very woman who'd recently terrified her with that reckless car stunt, stood just yards away.

Their eyes met across the room. Cassandra's lips curled into a knowing smile. "What a small world, seeing you here."

Murmurs rippled through the nearby crew. "Who is that stunning woman?" one whispered.

###Chapter 339

Vivian Hartley stepped into the venue like a breath of fresh spring air. Her emerald silk blouse cascaded like water over her curves, perfectly paired with tailored white jeans that showcased her endless legs. Strappy silver heels completed the look, adding just the right amount of edge to her elegant ensemble. Her raven hair was swept into a chic low bun, secured with a dazzling diamond clip that caught the light with every movement.

Even the professional makeup artist assigned to Cassandra Blake did a double take at Vivian's flawless complexion. While others admired her effortless beauty, Cassandra narrowed her eyes and announced to the crowd, "This is Vivian's first major role with Ivory Phoenix Productions."

"First role?" Murmurs rippled through the gathered guests. A bold voice called out, "But Ivory Phoenix never casts unknowns. Was Ms. Hartley an influencer before this?"

With graceful composure, Vivian responded, "No, I'm completely new to this industry. Please, just call me Vivian."

Julian Montoya quickly came to her defense. "Vivian may be new to some of you, but her talent speaks for itself. She's auditioned for us before." He vaguely referenced Vivian's previous viral moment with Serena Whitmore, unaware that Adrian Blackwood had meticulously erased all traces of that incident online.

The revelation only fueled more speculation. After her initial unsuccessful audition, most assumed she'd been rejected. Now this newcomer was starring in Ivory Phoenix's flagship drama? Her stunning appearance suggested powerful backing.

The atmosphere shifted palpably as admiration turned to skeptical whispers. The tension between Vivian and Cassandra was electric. While Vivian's patron remained unknown, everyone knew Cassandra enjoyed Adrian Blackwood's favor, and the director had explicit orders to give her special treatment. The room quickly chose sides.

Two late arrivals caused a commotion, prompting the overwhelmed makeup artist to tell Vivian, "We're fully booked now. You'll have to do your own makeup - the supplies are over there."

Julian's face darkened, but Vivian gently tugged his sleeve and shook her head, silently urging restraint.

As the event began, the host announced an icebreaker: "Let's have each guest call a close friend to join our live broadcast - either in person or via video!"

"I'll go first," Cassandra declared, throwing a challenging glance at Vivian.

The host played along. "Who will our lovely Cassandra call? I remember her first co-star was that famous pop singer. Could it be him?"

"Cassandra was huge online before acting," someone whispered excitedly. "Maybe she'll get that top streamer to join?"

Cassandra smirked mysteriously and tapped her phone. The massive screen lit up with a familiar face.

"It's Serena Whitmore!"

Gasps filled the room.

The camera zoomed in on Vivian's reaction as her composed expression faltered for just a heartbeat before she schooled her features into perfect neutrality.

Serena's polished voice rang out through the speakers. "Hello darling! Are you finally ready to admit I was right about everything?"

The tension in the room became almost tangible as all eyes darted between the two women on screen and the elegant newcomer standing frozen near the makeup station. Vivian's fingers tightened imperceptibly around her clutch, her knuckles turning white beneath her flawless manicure.

Julian moved closer, his protective stance speaking volumes. But it was the flicker of something unreadable in Vivian's eyes that truly captured the audience's attention - a fleeting glimpse of steel beneath the poised exterior.

The game had just begun.
###Chapter 340

Gasps rippled through the studio as Serena Whitmore's face appeared on the massive LED screen. The audience erupted in excited murmurs.

"Cassandra actually knows Serena Whitmore?" someone whispered in disbelief.

Vivian Hartley adjusted her earpiece casually. "Serena, we're doing that segment where we invite someone close today. Are you available?"

The screen showed Serena rubbing sleep from her eyes, her silk pajamas slightly rumpled. "Give me twenty minutes? Just rolled out of bed - haven't even brushed my teeth yet."

The host fanned herself dramatically. "Serena Whitmore without makeup is still more stunning than most of us at our best!"

From her position near the edge of the set, Vivian noticed every calculated detail - the perfectly tousled bedhead, the strategic lighting angle. She exchanged a knowing glance with Julian Montoya, who had also subtly retreated from center stage.

They gravitated toward each other, discussing scene blocking techniques in low voices while the chaos continued around them.

When Cassandra finished her call, the host practically bounced toward Vivian. "Now Vivian, who will you be inviting today?"

The female MC, clearly impressed by Cassandra's connection, gave Vivian a patronizing smile. "Don't stress if you don't have industry friends yet. Bringing someone from your personal life is completely fine."

Julian suddenly spoke up. "Why not call Sebastian Hartwell?" His gaze lingered on Vivian's composed expression - serene as a winter rose untouched by the surrounding storm.

A male guest nearly choked. "Sebastian Hartwell? The Sebastian Hartwell?"

Recognition flashed across an audience member's face. "Wait, isn't she starring opposite Sebastian in that new drama?"

"She's even more breathtaking in person, no wonder she got cast with him!"

But not all comments were kind. "I heard she's been clinging to Sebastian's coattails for publicity. Is that what she's trying to do now?"

"Sebastian takes his craft seriously, while she's just using him as a stepping stone. Disgusting."

Cassandra added fuel to the fire with saccharine concern. "I've heard you two are close. If you called, he'd definitely come, right?"

Vivian found herself trapped. Agreeing would confirm the opportunist allegations. Refusing would suggest their relationship wasn't genuine.

Realizing his blunder, Julian tried to backtrack. "The ice-breaker activities work best with good friends. I forgot Sebastian rarely does variety shows."

Cassandra smirked, tossing her hair. "Serena canceled three meetings for me. Surely Sebastian would do the same for you?"

Vivian's voice remained steady. "Sebastian and I are professional colleagues. His participation would be a favor, not an obligation. As someone new, I'd rather not impose."

The host quickly intervened. "Vivian, have you decided who you'll invite?"
###Chapter 341

Vivian hesitated for a brief moment before responding, "Could we invite someone who isn't famous?"

"A non-celebrity?" The host's smile faltered slightly before brightening again. "What about inviting Sebastian? I'm sure the audience would love to see him here!"

The studio erupted in cheers, with everyone except Julian showing enthusiasm.

Vivian felt trapped by the situation. Julian glanced at her helplessly, but Vivian remained composed, her expression unreadable despite the growing pressure.

"I'm not busy!" Audrey stood on her toes, trying to grab Dominic's phone.

Dominic easily kept it out of reach with his height advantage. "Adrian, this is perfect. A national variety show appearance would announce your relationship to the entire country. And about the divorce papers... you understand what this means."

Audrey's eyes widened in shock. She lightly smacked Dominic's arm twice. "Dominic! How could you manipulate Vivian like this? She just decided to divorce! I'm telling Vivian that Adrian is coming!"

Her hits were more like playful taps than actual strikes.

"Adrian, the ball's in your court now." Dominic ended the call and slipped his phone into his pocket, his expression unusually serious. "I'm not manipulating anyone. Can't you see the connection between them? It's better to mend a marriage than end it, yet you seem determined to break them apart."

Audrey countered, "How am I breaking them up? Adrian and that scheming Serena are still involved. Should Vivian just accept being part of a love triangle?"

"That's for them to figure out, not you. They're adults who can make their own decisions about relationships. As a friend, you should respect boundaries," Dominic replied, his gaze intense yet his voice gentle.

Audrey was momentarily stunned by Dominic's uncharacteristic seriousness.

Seizing the moment, Dominic guided her toward the exit. Before she could protest, she found herself buckled into the passenger seat of his car.

At Blackwood Group headquarters, Adrian sat at his desk, fingers drumming rhythmically against the polished wood.

Ethan observed him carefully before approaching. "Mr. Blackwood, shall I prepare the car for the television studio?"

Meanwhile, Audrey had just stepped out of the company building when a tall figure blocked her path. Looking up, she saw Dominic and immediately turned to retreat inside.

Dominic caught her wrist, stopping her with a pleading look. "Audrey, please... can we talk?"

Gone was his usual playful demeanor. The dark circles under his eyes, unshaven beard, and exhausted appearance made him look years older, clearly having suffered sleepless nights.

Audrey tried to pull away several times, but Dominic's grip remained firm. Her wrist began to redden from the pressure, yet she couldn't break free.

As they stood locked in this silent battle, her phone rang. With her free hand, she answered - it was a video call from Vivian.
###Chapter 342

"Vivian's calling, quiet down," Audrey said to Dominic, then switched to a cheerful tone. "Hey Viv, what's up?"

Vivian's face appeared on the screen, her expression unusually serious. "I'm at Spotlight Night right now. Can you come be my partner for the challenge segment?"

"Of course! Just send me the location. I'll be there ASAP," Audrey responded eagerly, seizing the perfect excuse to leave.

After hanging up, she flashed her phone at Dominic. "See? I've got to go. No time for chitchat."

Dominic watched her desperate escape attempt with amusement. He pulled out his own phone and dialed Adrian. "Adrian, your wife's at Spotlight Night and needs a partner. She tried calling Audrey, but she's... preoccupied now."

Adrian paused thoughtfully before asking, "Do you think I should make an appearance?"

On the Spotlight Night set, the introductions had just concluded when staff escorted Serena onto the stage. Her smoky pink V-neck tulle gown shimmered under the lights, but it was the dazzling diamond necklace around her throat that captured everyone's attention.

Serena's understated elegance often went unnoticed in the flashy entertainment industry. She typically relied on haute couture to make statements. While most celebrities struggled to access such exclusive pieces, Adrian could acquire them for her with a single phone call. His financial backing had gradually elevated her status among peers and fans alike, who constantly praised her refined taste.

She strode confidently to center stage, briefly glancing at Vivian before locking eyes with Cassandra.

"Serena!" Cassandra gushed, rushing to take her arm with exaggerated care, practically fawning over her.

Serena accepted the microphone gracefully. "Hello everyone, I'm Serena. Cassandra and I are close friends, and I'm here to support her today. Go easy on me," she added playfully, sticking out her tongue.

The host's eyes were glued to her necklace. "That's an extraordinary piece," he remarked.

Serena casually touched the jewels. "A gift from someone very special," she said nonchalantly.

One male guest suddenly gasped. "Wait—isn't that the eight-million-dollar necklace from last week's charity auction?"

Female audience members sighed with envy as the host teased, "That's not just 'someone special'—that's serious commitment."

Cassandra jumped in with mock innocence, "Don't embarrass Serena! She's always been modest."

"But her generous friend clearly isn't," the host countered. "Who wouldn't want someone who showers them with such extravagant gifts?"

The crowd buzzed with speculation as Serena offered a small smile. "We're just good friends for now. Money means nothing to him—this necklace was practically pocket change."

Her gaze subtly shifted to Vivian at the edge of the stage. "Originally he wanted to gift me a piano, but I'm not much of a musician. It would've been wasted on me, so I chose this instead."

Vivian's fists clenched so tightly her nails left crescent marks in her palms. The physical pain barely registered against the sting of Serena's words. It wasn't unbearable—just the persistent ache of a splinter working its way deeper.

That piano hadn't been just any gift. It had been her rejected consolation prize. The realization that she'd been groveling for something someone else had turned down made her stomach churn. If not for the cameras, she might have vomited right there on stage.
###Chapter 343

The studio lights burned bright against Vivian's skin as she forced her expression into professional neutrality. Her fingers absently traced the edge of her phone while the audience's murmurs swirled around her like autumn leaves.

A sharp whisper cut through the noise. "That must be Adrian Blackwood she's talking about - the CEO of Blackwood Group."

"Remember when Serena got harassed at that gala last year?" another voice hissed. "He stormed in like some dark knight and shut it down immediately."

Vivian's nails bit into her palms as the host deftly avoided mentioning Adrian by name, though everyone knew exactly who they meant. The studio audience leaned forward in their seats, hungry for drama.

Serena stood center stage with practiced grace, her lips curved in a smile that didn't reach her eyes. "Some connections," she said with deliberate vagueness, "transcend time and circumstance."

The implication hung heavy in the air. Vivian's stomach twisted.

"Vivian? Vivian!" Julian's voice snapped her back to the present. The host was smiling expectantly. "Any update from your mystery guest?"

Her phone screen remained stubbornly blank. "They must be running late," she murmured, typing another frantic message.

The host exchanged a look with a stagehand before turning back with suddenly sparkling eyes. "Well, while we wait... we have a surprise video connection for you, Vivian."

Cassandra's scoff was audible across the stage. "How tacky. Serena came in person, but your friend can't be bothered?"

Vivian barely registered the jab. Her pulse pounded in her ears as the massive screen behind them flickered to life. The studio held its breath.

"Care to guess who it might be?" the host teased, clearly enjoying the suspense.

Vivian's mouth went dry. "Sebastian?" she ventured, naming her frequent co-star.

The host's grin widened. "Oh, you're in for quite the surprise."

The screen resolved into crisp clarity, revealing not the expected face of her friend Audrey, but—

The audience gasped in unison.

Vivian's knees nearly buckled.

Adrian Blackwood's piercing gaze filled the enormous display, his tailored suit and icy demeanor unmistakable even through digital pixels. "Hello, Vivian," his deep voice rumbled through the speakers. "Miss me?"
###Chapter 344

Vivian's face drained of color as she stumbled backward, her voice trembling with disbelief. "What? Sebastian? That's impossible! I thought you two weren't that close?"

She had mentioned Sebastian earlier, confident he would never attend a variety show for Vivian. Everyone knew about Sebastian's notorious aloofness and his difficulty connecting with people in the industry, especially those linked to negative rumors about him. Even if they had good on-screen chemistry, that wouldn't be enough for him to risk potential gossip.

Before Cassandra could fully comprehend this shocking development, the host had already activated the large screen.

Sebastian's face appeared, greeting Vivian, the other guests, and the audience warmly. "I'm currently tied up with prior commitments outside Crestwood, so I can't be there in person today," he explained with a charming smile. "But since this is Vivian's first variety show appearance, I trust you'll all take good care of her."

"Thank you all in advance!" he added with a slight bow.

Sebastian's endorsement instantly shifted the audience's perception of Vivian. Throughout the exchange, Vivian maintained her composed demeanor, showing no signs of arrogance despite the dramatic change in atmosphere.

Cassandra was so furious she nearly cracked a molar, finally forcing out through gritted teeth, "So, Sebastian and Ms. Hartley are actually quite intimate, aren't they?"

Her comment was barely audible on set, but Sebastian - having been briefed about Cassandra's antagonistic behavior toward Vivian - watched her intently through the video call.

"We've always shared a special bond," Sebastian countered smoothly. "Vivian has been an incredible mentor and support to me throughout my career. I consider her guidance invaluable."

The cameras captured Cassandra's face twisting in barely concealed rage before she managed to plaster on a strained smile. "How... enlightening," she murmured through clenched teeth.

The unexpected appearance of A-list actor Sebastian Hartwell guaranteed a ratings bonanza for the show. The host, receiving frantic signals from the producers, seized the opportunity to ask more probing questions.

Out of respect for Vivian, Sebastian answered each query thoughtfully. With his endorsement, previously silent audience members now felt emboldened to voice their opinions.

"I find Vivian genuinely authentic, while Cassandra comes across as painfully artificial. Half the time I can't even follow her pretentious rambling," one audience member remarked loudly.

"Has everyone forgotten Vivian's performances? I saw her scenes trending on Instagram - she completely outshone Serena in every scene they shared," another added.

"Sebastian famously avoids the spotlight. If he's publicly supporting Vivian, that speaks volumes about her character," a third person chimed in.

Meanwhile, Serena slipped into the hallway for air. Leaning against the window, she gazed down at the television station's back parking lot. Among the rows of vehicles, a sleek silver luxury car immediately caught her attention.

Miranda, standing beside her, noticed the car too. "Serena, did you ask Mr. Blackwood to pick you up?" she inquired curiously.

"Why would I do that?" Serena replied with a frown.

After a moment's consideration, Miranda suggested, "Perhaps Mr. Blackwood couldn't find you at the agency and came here instead. I'll arrange for some paparazzi shots to post on celebrity blogs."

"Fine," Serena answered distantly, an uneasy feeling settling in her stomach as if anticipating impending disaster.

As the show progressed, Sebastian was engaged in a fascinating discussion with the host when a commanding presence appeared at the edge of the stage. Adrian had come straight from his office, dressed in an impeccably tailored silver-gray suit that accentuated his striking features. The stage lights highlighted his aristocratic bone structure as he stood with an air of detached elegance that commanded immediate attention.
###Chapter 345

The studio lights blazed overhead as the live audience remained oblivious to the dramatic entrance happening behind them. Adrian Blackwood's sudden appearance sent electric whispers rippling through the crowd like wildfire.

"Is that...? No, it can't be!"
"Sweet heavens, he's even more breathtaking than Sebastian Hartwell!"
"Since when does a CEO attend variety shows?"

The growing commotion finally drew the attention of the onstage guests. Vivian Hartley's breath hitched when her gaze landed on the imposing figure standing in the shadows. Her fingers trembled around the microphone as her mind raced. What was Adrian doing here?

Backstage, the director nearly dropped his clipboard when his assistant confirmed Serena Whitmore's presence. Everyone in the industry knew Adrian worshipped the ground Serena walked on. With both Serena and Sebastian involved, their ratings would smash records!

Beaming, the director rushed forward. "Mr. Blackwood—" he began, ready to mention Serena waiting in the green room.

But Adrian strode right past him, his piercing gaze locked onto the stage.

When Vivian met those obsidian eyes, time seemed to freeze. The intensity in his stare rooted her to the spot. Despite her shock, she knew with terrifying certainty - he'd come for her. Her pulse pounded so violently she feared the mic might pick it up.

This wasn't how she'd imagined their reunion. Instead of joy, cold dread pooled in her stomach. Every instinct screamed to run, but fleeing mid-recording would destroy her career. She bit her lip hard enough to taste copper, reminding herself this wasn't live. Maybe they could edit this entire segment out later.

Julian Montoya, misreading the situation, stepped forward to intercept Adrian, thinking he meant to confront Vivian for Serena's sake. "Mr. Blackwood—"

One glacial glance from Adrian had Julian retreating instantly.

Adrian stopped before Vivian, studying her with an unreadable expression. The studio lights caught the subtle silver threads in his navy suit, making him look every inch the untouchable tycoon. "You didn't tell me you'd be on Spotlight Night." His voice was deceptively calm, like the eerie stillness before a storm.

The director paled, realizing his mistake. If Adrian wasn't here for Serena... A sickening thought struck him. Had they been backing the wrong person all along? Memories of how they'd treated Vivian made his stomach churn.

Vivian focused on Adrian's tie pin to steady herself. "I didn't think variety shows were your thing."

"They're not," Adrian admitted, his deep voice resonating through the suddenly silent studio. Then, with quiet intensity that made her heart stutter: "But I'll make an exception for you."
###Chapter 346

Time stood still for Vivian as Adrian's voice echoed through the studio. Instead of feeling touched, a cold shiver ran down her spine. The same Adrian Blackwood who had maintained a professional distance in public was now whispering sweet nothings to her on national television.

She mentally catalogued all the recent changes in Adrian's behavior. Had this been a private setting, she might have checked his temperature or searched for hidden cameras.

Beneath his composed exterior, Adrian's pulse raced wildly. Not even during his toughest negotiations in Frostholm had he felt this unsettled. Always the strategist, he'd navigated every situation with precision. Yet here he was, acting like a lovestruck teenager, throwing caution to the wind.

These were the exact words Ethan had suggested during their car ride to the studio. Thirty minutes ago, Adrian had scoffed at the idea, certain he'd never utter such sentimental drivel. But when the moment came, the words flowed effortlessly.

The host and director exchanged knowing glances before approaching the couple, their faces alight with mischief. "So what's really going on between you two? Are we witnessing a real-life romance here?"

The microphone hovered between them.

Vivian maintained her polite smile but reached for the mic first. "I think there's been some confusion. We're not actually-"

Before she could finish, Adrian pulled her close, his gaze softening as it met hers. "Not just dating. We're married."

The studio audience gasped collectively.

Surrounded by Adrian's familiar cologne, Vivian's thoughts spun wildly. She stood frozen in his embrace, like a marionette with cut strings. She desperately sought composure but found herself utterly unprepared for this turn of events.

It reminded her of those early days after their wedding, when she'd longed for public acknowledgment as Mrs. Blackwood. What had she wanted back then? Simply to be the perfect society wife.

Adrian noticed her stunned expression. A flicker of unease had shot through him when she denied their relationship, but he quickly suppressed it. If they argued now, he'd become tabloid fodder. Still, he mentally noted the serious conversation they'd need to have later.

Adrian's declaration landed like a bombshell, rendering the entire crew speechless - a plot twist no script could have predicted. The most shocked expressions belonged to Cassandra and Julian. Cassandra, forgetting she was still on camera, whispered, "This can't be... Mr. Blackwood is her husband?"

The director quickly muted her microphone. Realization dawned on Cassandra as she remembered she'd essentially paraded herself as the other woman in front of the actual wife. Julian recovered faster, though the revelation still weighed heavily.

He felt a pang of sympathy for Vivian. How could her own husband help Serena steal a role meant for her? As a fellow man, Julian couldn't comprehend Adrian's logic in neglecting such a devoted wife for someone like Serena.

The audience buzzed with excited whispers. The director shot the host a meaningful look, who quickly stepped forward, his voice laced with curiosity. "Is this marriage for real?"
###Chapter 347

The burning question lingered in the charged air: Was their marriage legally valid, or just a hollow performance of husband and wife?

Vivian stood rigid beside Adrian, feeling like a marionette with its strings cut as his arm possessively encircled her waist. "We're lawfully wedded," he declared with effortless confidence.

To eliminate all skepticism, Adrian produced his phone with a magician's flourish. The screen displayed a crystal-clear image of their marriage license, which the cameraman immediately magnified on the venue's massive display.

Vivian's nails dug into her palms unconsciously. She vividly remembered how Adrian had barely glanced at their certificate after their courthouse wedding. When had he taken this perfectly composed photograph? Certainly not back then. He must have snapped it today en route to the event - another calculated move in his grand revelation.

Naturally. The Adrian she knew never acted without meticulous planning. Even this dramatic public declaration wasn't spontaneous; every detail had been orchestrated. Whether this realization comforted her or simply served as emotional armor, it brought unexpected solace. Keeping expectations low was self-preservation. She'd already carelessly exposed her heart once - she wouldn't make that mistake again.

Meanwhile, Serena intercepted hushed whispers from staff members speculating Adrian had attended solely for Vivian. Rage ignited in her chest as she stormed toward the stage. The director, anticipating her outburst, had strategically positioned security guards who now formed an impenetrable barrier in the corridor.

"Serena, please compose yourself," the director implored as he intercepted her.

All pretense of refinement vanished as Serena snapped, "Move! Adrian would never do this to me. That scheming Vivian must be manipulating him!" Adrian had resisted divorce proceedings - Vivian must have exploited that weakness to force this announcement.

Until this moment, the world believed Serena was Adrian's only true love. If this footage aired, she'd be publicly humiliated as the other woman. The thought made her vision blur with fury. Why did Vivian always sabotage her happiness?

Two years ago during her separation from Adrian, Vivian had swooped in to marry him. Now just as Serena was reclaiming her position, Vivian struck again. She'd always believed her secret weapon guaranteed Adrian's loyalty, but now...

Miranda rushed over, offering the director an apologetic smile before grasping Serena's arm. "Mr. Blackwood has made his statement. What will charging onstage accomplish except creating a spectacle?"

Serena's glare faltered momentarily. Sensing her client's precarious control, Miranda discreetly pinched her wrist and whispered, "Consider the long game. This is pre-recorded. Instead of causing a scene, convince Mr. Blackwood to reshoot the episode later."

Turning to the director, Miranda smoothly interjected, "Serena's experiencing heart palpitations - she can't continue filming today."

"Could you have Cassandra arrange a replacement guest?" Serena's voice dripped with barely contained frustration as Miranda maintained perfect composure.
###Chapter 348

The director gave a quick nod, his expression tense. "Serena's health comes first. She's always been fragile. Go get her checked at the hospital immediately. We'll deal with Cassandra here - don't concern yourself with that." He was genuinely afraid Serena might burst onto the stage and turn the live show into a dramatic confrontation between wife and ex-lover. Ratings were important, but not at the risk of a complete disaster.

Cassandra watched the unfolding scene with growing irritation as the audience showered Vivian with praise, each compliment like a knife twisting in her gut. The female host who had been fawning over her earlier now gushed about the couple's undeniable chemistry. Forcing a brittle smile, Cassandra stepped forward, cutting through the chatter. "Since Ms. Hartley's husband has made such a grand entrance, shouldn't we proceed to the next segment?"

Her interruption was met with an icy stare from the hostess, whose previous warmth had evaporated like morning dew. The main host turned to Cassandra, his cheerful mask slipping slightly. With a smile that didn't reach his eyes, he said, "Actually, Serena mentioned she wasn't feeling well and had to leave, so we'll need to adjust our schedule accordingly." The subtle jab wasn't lost on Cassandra. She knew perfectly well the host wouldn't give her any chance to shine now that Adrian had entered the picture.

Hearing Serena's name, Adrian's brows furrowed. He leaned close to Vivian, discreetly muting her microphone with a quick tap. "Serena was here?" he asked in a low voice.

Vivian's lips thinned as she noted his protective stance. Yet she couldn't forget that it was his past with Serena that had brought this trouble to her doorstep.

"She came specifically to embarrass me," Vivian replied coolly, her voice sharp enough to cut glass.

Adrian arched an eyebrow, a wry smile playing on his lips. "You? Embarrassed? With that razor-sharp wit of yours, I'd say you're practically invincible."

The words escaped before he could reconsider them. Remembering they were still on camera, he softened his tone, adding with a sigh, "Try not to take it personally. With her medical condition, she's more emotionally volatile than most."

Vivian pressed her lips together, refusing to respond. It was always the same pattern, the same excuses made for Serena's behavior.

Taking her silence as acquiescence, Adrian reached out and gave her head a light pat. The gesture was oddly affectionate yet patronizing, like soothing a temperamental kitten.

From the sidelines, Cassandra's eyes narrowed to slits as she watched their interaction. The easy intimacy between Adrian and Vivian sent waves of bitter jealousy coursing through her veins.

Ever the professional, the host smoothly intervened with a bright smile. "Since Cassandra's guest had to leave unexpectedly, why don't we switch to a talent showcase segment?"

The suggestion ignited a spark in Cassandra's eyes. She seized the opportunity like a predator spotting prey. "I can play the violin," she announced, her voice brimming with confidence.

She had spent a decade perfecting her violin skills, always keeping this ace up her sleeve. Her gaze flicked toward Vivian as she added, "Ms. Hartley, since you've managed to marry so well, surely you've cultivated some talents of your own. Care to join me for a duet?"

The challenge hung in the air like a thrown gauntlet. Internally, Cassandra smirked. She was certain Vivian's popularity was nothing but smoke and mirrors. If the woman had any real talent, the world would have seen it by now.

In her mind, the battle lines were drawn. She had already burned bridges with Vivian, and any apology would be pointless. If she was going to face backlash after this show, she might as well go down fighting and take Vivian with her. Cassandra could already envision the headlines: a self-made artist standing her ground against a social climber. Public sympathy would naturally flow to the underdog.
###Chapter 349

Julian Montoya sensed the tension thickening the air. "I could play the guitar," he offered, attempting to diffuse the situation.

Cassandra Blake wasn't having any of it. Her lips curled into a mocking smile. "How about a duet with you instead?" She shot him a withering glance. "Mr. Montoya, this isn't your time to play the gallant rescuer. Her husband is right here, isn't he?"

Julian rubbed his neck awkwardly, chuckling nervously. "That's not what I meant. With you two dominating the stage, us veterans need to fight for our share of attention."

Cassandra's smile turned glacial. "Violin and guitar don't exactly create harmonious music. If you're so desperate for screen time, perhaps a solo performance would suit you better."

Her words were deliberately cutting, but she couldn't care less. Julian's clumsy attempt at mediation only reinforced her belief - Vivian Hartley had no real talent to speak of.

This was her moment to expose Vivian as nothing more than a beautiful parasite clinging to her powerful husband. In today's digital age, Cassandra thought with dark satisfaction, not even Adrian Blackwood's influence could contain the wildfire of public opinion once she ignited it.

The studio audience's gazes shifted to Vivian. Like Cassandra, they'd dismissed her as mere arm candy, a trophy wife. Their earlier admiration quickly soured into contempt. What value could a woman with only looks bring to such an illustrious family? The female audience members seethed with resentment, silently willing Vivian to embarrass herself and be discarded by Adrian.

Adrian's piercing gaze locked onto Cassandra. Her influencer-perfect appearance left him utterly unmoved. People like her were insignificant gnats, incapable of causing real damage. He harbored no concern for Vivian - if anything, he pitied Cassandra for foolishly provoking his wife.

His attention returned to the woman beside him. Observing her serene composure, he was struck by how much Vivian reminded him of himself. The poised woman before him mirrored the confident figure who'd proposed their contractual marriage years ago, yet she'd blossomed into something extraordinary. Like a rare orchid finally revealing its full splendor.

Pride swelled in his chest, mingled with an unexpected pang of loss. She no longer needed his protection as she once had.

Seizing the moment, Cassandra pretended magnanimity. "If Vivian doesn't know how to play, I won't force her. I can perform solo."

Vivian's response came calmly. "We could do a duet."

"I play piano. I only know a few pieces."

Cassandra froze, caught off guard. If she agreed, Vivian might choose a piece that showcased her own skills, turning the tables completely. Her plan to humiliate Vivian could spectacularly backfire.

As she scrambled for a response, inspiration struck. Remembering Serena Whitmore's earlier mention of a piano, she quickly pulled out her phone.

Her search revealed a photo of an elegant stranger with a grand piano. Smirking, Cassandra changed tactics. "Oh, you play piano? What kind did Mr. Blackwood buy for you? Do share - we'd love to learn more."
###Chapter 350

The mention of the piano brought back memories of Serena's past schemes, reopening old wounds in Vivian's heart. Vivian stepped forward, deliberately avoiding Adrian's outstretched hand. With measured composure, she asked, "Isn't this the talent showcase segment?"

Cassandra ignored her question and pressed further. "I heard about a crystal piano auctioned recently for a hundred million sterlings. How does yours compare?"

Adrian's brow furrowed slightly at Vivian's avoidance. He glanced at his rejected hand before letting it drop to his side. With thinly veiled irritation, he replied, "A hundred million? I recently purchased one for my wife at that price. Perhaps it's the same instrument."

Though addressing Cassandra, his gaze never left Vivian's profile.

It took Cassandra a full ten seconds to process his words. Her face fell. "What? I was referring to the piano featured in Eternal Melody."

"Oh," Adrian responded, twisting his wedding band with unconscious pride. "That's the one."

"The symbolism seemed particularly fitting," he continued, his voice softening. "I couldn't imagine giving it to anyone but my wife."

Vivian's expressive eyes widened as she turned toward him. "You knew about the symbolism?"

Straightening his suit jacket, Adrian answered with quiet satisfaction, "Naturally. Without its meaning, I would have simply commissioned a superior crystal piano."

Cassandra's envy burned visibly, her cheeks flushing crimson. "Mr. Blackwood, you never considered gifting it to someone else?"

Unaware of Serena's past manipulations, Adrian's patience wore thin. He closed the distance and firmly grasped Vivian's hand. "In this lifetime, I have only one wife. Of course I intend for us to be together forever."

Their interlaced fingers spoke volumes, conveying a connection deeper than words.

Within Vivian, an invisible crack widened in her carefully constructed defenses, suddenly impossible to ignore.

Julian observed Adrian's tender expression with growing concern. To any outsider, they appeared the picture of marital bliss. But Julian remembered too well - how Adrian had stolen Vivian's role... how he'd publicly humiliated her... how he'd left Vivian fallen while carrying Serena away...

His gaze returned to Vivian. The usual ice in her demeanor had thawed, replaced by a vulnerable warmth that pained him to witness. A brilliant actress, yet tragically ensnared in romantic turmoil. He debated intervention, but propriety held him back - they weren't close enough for such personal interference.

As murmurs spread through the crowd, the host stepped forward. "What a rare treat to witness Mr. Blackwood and Vivian's affection today! Would you honor us with a dance? Cassandra, perhaps you could provide violin accompaniment?"

Vivian responded evenly, "Certainly. I've dabbled in waltz, though I'm hardly proficient. Please forgive any missteps."

The host turned to Cassandra. "Would that be acceptable?"

Though playing violin differed from dancing, Cassandra reluctantly agreed for the show's sake. "Of course."


###Chapter 351

The evening air buzzed with anticipation as Vivian found herself reluctantly joining the performance. Though Cassandra had orchestrated this moment, the live band elevated the atmosphere exponentially. Adrian extended his hand with practiced grace, and Vivian placed hers in his palm.

His large hand engulfed her delicate fingers completely. Cassandra's sharp eyes immediately noticed Vivian's bare ring finger. Seizing the chance to stir trouble, she purred, "Vivian darling, where's your wedding band? Mr. Blackwood is wearing his so proudly."

In the chaos of fleeing Seabreeze Villa during the fire, Vivian had left her jewelry behind. The thought of replacing it hadn't even crossed her mind until this moment. Flustered by Cassandra's pointed question, Vivian opened her mouth but no words came out.

To everyone's surprise, Adrian answered smoothly, "If my wife chooses not to wear it, clearly the design doesn't suit her taste." His expression remained perfectly composed, giving nothing away.

Mistaking his calm demeanor for hidden resentment, Cassandra pressed further. "They say in every marriage, one partner always loves more deeply. Seems Mr. Blackwood is the devoted one here."

Julian quickly jumped to Vivian's defense. "That's not necessarily true. As actors, we often remove jewelry for roles. Vivian probably just forgot in her dedication to her craft."

Adrian's gaze slid to Julian, taking in the younger man's casual ensemble - designer jeans paired with a half-unbuttoned white shirt showcasing his gym-toned physique. A walking cliché.

The corner of Adrian's mouth twitched. Those so-called muscles were about as impressive as a malnourished greyhound's. What truly grated was Julian's repeated defense of Vivian - twice now. He found this upstart more irritating than that Hartwell boy. Especially remembering how Vivian had once taken his drink to give to Julian.

Adrian smoothly inserted himself between Vivian and Julian, addressing Cassandra with a smile that didn't reach his eyes. "I don't mind loving more. If my wife dislikes her ring, I'll buy her a new one. If her roles require different styles, I'll acquire a collection to match each character."

The crowd gasped at such extravagant promises. This level of indulgence bordered on fantasy. Vivian blinked in stunned silence. How could wedding rings hold meaning if they became disposable costume pieces?

Overwhelmed by Adrian's declarations, she murmured, "Shall we dance now?"

Adrian's arm encircled Vivian's waist as he guided her to center stage. The lights dimmed until only a spotlight illuminated them. As the music swelled, they began moving with effortless grace.

Initially, the audience watched with polite interest. But as their steps grew more intricate and synchronized, jaws dropped throughout the ballroom.

Wait - hadn't she claimed to be an amateur? This performance rivaled championship ballroom dancers! Combined with their striking beauty, they created pure visual poetry.

All attention remained riveted on the dazzling couple gliding across the floor, their movements a seamless conversation of elegance. Cassandra's violin strains faded into irrelevance as spectators became entranced. The light caught Vivian's hair, transforming her dark tresses into liquid silk that shimmered with every turn, radiating quiet magnetism.

Determined to reclaim attention, Cassandra abruptly switched to a frenetic piece, dramatically increasing the tempo. The band had no choice but to follow her lead. Attempting a waltz at this speed was courting disaster - one misstep would send them tumbling.

The host discreetly wiped his brow, anxiety mounting. If Adrian stumbled now, the entire network would bear the humiliation.

###Chapter 352

Their movements became a seamless whirlwind, leaving the audience breathless. Every step was executed with flawless precision, perfectly synchronized with the music's rhythm. Even the most skeptical spectators found themselves awestruck.

As the final note faded, silence gripped the room for a heartbeat before thunderous applause shattered the spell.

Vivian Hartley's transformation was complete. Where people once saw only a pretty face with mediocre talent, they now witnessed undeniable brilliance. What had been dismissed as a casual pastime became a breathtaking display of mastery.

Envy thrives on small differences. But true greatness inspires only reverence.

In that moment, Vivian ceased being Adrian Blackwood's decorative wife.

Instead, Adrian became the visionary who recognized her potential before the world did. He noticed the shifting gazes around them. Had he kept her hidden, she would never have earned this respect.

A decision crystallized in his mind. From now on, he would let her stand in her own light - not as Mrs. Blackwood, but as Vivian Hartley, the true jewel of the Blackwood legacy.

Backstage, a cluster of brand representatives materialized as they exited. Vivian assumed they came for Adrian and moved aside. To her astonishment, they offered brief greetings to him before swarming her with business cards.

"Ms. Hartley, our new skincare line needs your elegance as its face."

"Ms. Hartley, this philanthropic campaign was made for you."

"Ms. Hartley, our short film requires your emotional depth in the lead role."

Adrian leaned against the wall, amusement dancing in his eyes. "Quite the popular star, Ms. Hartley," he teased, gesturing for her to continue. His relaxed posture mirrored the countless times she'd waited patiently during his business affairs.

Vivian engaged politely but declined the cards, producing Lydia Bennett's contact instead. "My agent handles these matters. I'll share my preferences with her."

Adrian stubbed out his cigarette and straightened. "May I reclaim my wife now?" His quiet request scattered the crowd like startled birds.

"Mr. Blackwood, our apologies! We'll arrange dinner to make amends."

Without responding, Adrian guided Vivian away with a protective arm around her shoulders.

The walk to the car passed in weighted silence. Vivian searched for words but found none. Ethan Caldwell stood ready by the vehicle, opening the door with practiced efficiency. "Mr. Blackwood, Mrs. Blackwood."

Just as Adrian bent to enter, a razor-sharp voice sliced through the night. "Vivian!"

Turning, Vivian locked eyes with Cassandra Blake, whose gaze burned with undisguised intensity.
###Chapter 353

Adrian cast a fleeting glance backward, his voice barely above a whisper. "Pay her no mind."

Vivian's response came firm and unwavering. "You were correct earlier. Certain conflicts simply can't be avoided."

Something shifted in Adrian's posture at her words. His shoulders straightened, the hard lines of his face softening imperceptibly. For years, he'd grown accustomed to commands met with either trembling obedience or empty compliance. But Vivian's agreement resonated differently - a genuine meeting of minds. The fragile rose he'd sheltered all this time had grown thorns of her own.

Facing Cassandra now, Vivian's composed exterior barely concealed her mounting irritation. Whether it was Cassandra's inherent volatility or Serena's manipulations at play, the relentless targeting was undeniable. Vivian wondered if this confrontation was yet another of Cassandra's calculated power plays.

"Burning bridges serves no one. Our paths may cross again."

Cassandra stepped forward with practiced confidence. "Last time, you walked away untouched. Now you've stolen my spotlight on the show."

"Must you push me to the edge?"

Her voice dripped with barely concealed bitterness. "The moment filming wrapped, three sponsors pulled their contracts. My family depends on me."

Vivian's brow furrowed in genuine confusion. "Sponsor withdrawals? Why bring this to me instead of addressing it with them directly?"

Cassandra's hands flew up in exasperation. "Honestly, Vivian! Stop playing naive. The episode was pre-recorded - those decisions couldn't have been made so quickly without inside influence. It had to be you!"

She bit her lip, casting a suspicious glance toward Adrian. "You had him do it."

Adrian turned to Vivian, his voice deceptively calm. "'Walked away untouched'? What happened?"

The silence stretched as Cassandra's mind reeled. If Vivian hadn't told him about their previous encounter, what had prompted the sponsors' sudden change of heart?

Vivian's response came crisp and unadorned. "Last time, she tried to run me down with her car. A warning, I suppose. Or perhaps just petty revenge."

She offered no justification for Cassandra's actions.

Cassandra gasped, her face a mask of theatrical shock at Vivian's bluntness. "You!"

Vivian met her gaze squarely, her voice glacial. "Am I mistaken? Isn't that precisely what occurred?"

Flustered, Cassandra stammered, "You never mentioned it before. Why now?"

Vivian's eyes narrowed slightly. "Because now, the truth deserves to be known."

The temperature seemed to drop several degrees as Adrian's expression hardened into something dangerous. His gaze lifted slowly to meet Ethan's concerned one.

Ethan already had his phone in hand. "I'll contact Ivory Phoenix Productions immediately," he said, fingers flying across the screen.

Adrian's voice cut through the tension like winter wind. "And notify the police."
###Chapter 354

Vivian's pulse raced wildly, her voice trembling with a cocktail of defiance and terror. "I was personally selected by Ivory Phoenix Productions' CEO! Do you really think this intimidation will work? In this digital age, your money can't silence everyone. I'll expose this injustice across all social platforms!"

Her tirade was cut short by a commanding baritone that sliced through the tension. "That privilege has been revoked," the voice declared, instantly silencing the room.

Vivian's gaze flickered toward the interruption - a sharply dressed man in a tailored navy suit approaching with purposeful strides.

Recognition flashed in her eyes. It was Damien Vaughn's executive assistant from Ivory Phoenix.

"Ms. Hartley, Mr. Blackwood," the assistant greeted with a professional nod before turning his attention to Cassandra. His composed demeanor contrasted starkly with the charged atmosphere. "Your contract with Ivory Phoenix has been terminated effective immediately. There's a substantial penalty clause awaiting your signature. My team will escort you to our headquarters to complete the paperwork."

Cassandra's face flushed crimson as she spat, "I'll drag your company's dirty secrets through the mud online!"

The assistant remained unfazed, his response chillingly calm. "By all means. Should you choose that path, we'll happily add libel to your existing charges of attempted vehicular assault."

"Additional charges?" Cassandra's voice cracked, her bravado crumbling. "What other ridiculous accusations are you fabricating?"

Years of scraping by in the industry - her modest savings drained on a cramped apartment and leased car - left her financially vulnerable.

Vivian observed the exchange with detached calm before addressing the assistant. "I trust you'll handle this appropriately."

"Your generosity is misplaced, Ms. Hartley," the assistant replied smoothly. "This reflects our failure to properly vet talent. Mr. Vaughn will contact you personally regarding compensation." His gaze hardened as he turned back to Cassandra. "After processing her termination, we'll deliver her directly to the police precinct. You have my word."

At his signal, two broad-shouldered security officers materialized, flanking Cassandra with military precision. Their viselike grips on her arms rendered further protests impossible. Her mouth worked soundlessly, all fight drained from her.

Adrian, already settled in the luxury sedan, leaned forward as Vivian slid in beside him. His usually sharp features softened unexpectedly. "If anyone ever threatens you again, come to me immediately. Even if you're capable of handling it alone... I want to be your first call."

Vivian's lips curved slightly, though her eyes remained unreadable. "She's painfully transparent." The words were dismissive, but her mind circled the true puppet master behind Cassandra's audacity: Serena. Without Serena's backing, Cassandra would never have dared such recklessness.

But Vivian swallowed the observation. Raising Serena's involvement now would only trigger another pointless argument with Adrian. Some battles required strategic timing.

The assistant's frosty voice carried through the open car door: "The security footage clearly shows you intentionally swerving toward Ms. Hartley. That we're pursuing criminal charges rather than civil litigation speaks to our company's values. Ivory Phoenix protects its partners."

His words hung in the air as the car door thudded shut, sealing them in soundproofed luxury. The engine purred to life, carrying them away from the confrontation, though the tension lingered like static electricity.
###Chapter 355

Ethan Caldwell stood with his usual commanding presence, his voice firm as he declared, "The Blackwood Group's legal team will work closely with Ivory Phoenix Productions. I'll personally coordinate with several marshals to expedite the investigation."

Cassandra Blake's face turned ashen. Her knees threatened to buckle as visions of prison bars and cold metal handcuffs flashed through her mind, shattering her earlier bravado. What she'd dismissed as an empty threat—a momentary lapse in judgment—now loomed as a terrifying reality. The tremors running through her body betrayed her crumbling composure.

The assistant's crisp voice sliced through her mounting panic. "Apologies for the delay, Mr. Blackwood, Ms. Hartley. I'll be escorting her back to headquarters to finalize the termination agreement. The breach of contract penalty stands at eight million." His gaze deliberately lingered on Cassandra as he delivered the staggering figure.

"Eight million?" Cassandra's voice cracked, rising to an unnatural pitch. "How am I supposed to come up with eight million?"

Her desperate shriek echoed through the room, a futile attempt to regain control of the spiraling situation.

Adrian Blackwood reclined in his seat, nodding absently. "She's naive," he agreed, though Cassandra's features had already blurred from his memory.

Ethan closed the car door with a muted click and settled into the driver's seat. Through the rearview mirror, his tense eyes met Vivian's. "The hospital reported Natasha's disappearance."

Vivian's fingers stilled on her knee. She hadn't anticipated Adrian monitoring her family so closely—this newfound vigilance contrasted sharply with his usual reactive nature. The man who once waited for problems to land at his feet now seemed to anticipate them.

"Her injuries were nearly healed," Vivian offered with a casual shrug. "Perhaps she simply checked herself out early?"

With her live-streaming privileges revoked after the scandal, Natasha's capacity for mischief had diminished. But Ethan shook his head. "No discharge paperwork was filed. Daphne arrived with lunch to find her room vacant. Her phone's offline, and security footage only shows her leaving after receiving a call."

"Double the surveillance," Adrian interjected, his casual tone belying the steel beneath. He wouldn't risk another threat to Vivian's safety.

Yet in his determination to shield her, Adrian couldn't foresee the storm gathering on the horizon.

After discussing the Dawson family affairs, Vivian hesitated before suggesting, "Let's dine out tonight. It's been ages since we visited Emerald Pizzeria."

Feeling suddenly self-conscious, she quickly added, "Consider it my thank you for appearing as our guest today."

Adrian's lips curved into a faint smile, pride flickering in his eyes. "I hadn't planned to attend. Dominic reached out—mentioned your friend canceled last minute."

"Dominic?" Vivian's stomach tightened, recalling Audrey's earlier unease. "Is he with Audrey now? Perhaps we should postpone and check on her instead."

Adrian's expression darkened instantly. "Is this your idea of gratitude?"
###Chapter 356

Vivian hurried to clarify, "It's just that I'm concerned about Audrey—"

Adrian brushed off her worries with an indifferent flick of his wrist. "What's there to worry about? Dominic's security team is the finest in Crestwood. She's perfectly safe."

"That's not what concerns me—" Vivian muttered, pressing her lips together in quiet displeasure.

Adrian studied her face. "You're worried about their relationship, aren't you?"

Vivian's eyebrows shot up. "How did you know?"

He gave a derisive chuckle. "It's written all over your face."

With a sigh, Vivian lowered her gaze. "They're not well-suited."

Adrian leaned back casually. "In matters of the heart, there's no such thing as perfect compatibility. It boils down to whether two people want each other. This is the first time I've seen Dominic so taken with a woman. Whether Audrey returns his feelings—you'd know better than I."

"Love is something only the people involved can navigate. Outsiders just complicate things."

Vivian softly repeated his words, "So in relationships, there's no perfect match, only wanting or not wanting?"

She turned to study Adrian's profile. His expression remained impassive, as if they were discussing the weather.

Biting back the question burning her tongue—Do you want me?—Vivian instead asked, "Would you prefer seafood or something else?"

Adrian pulled out his phone without looking at her, his voice laced with sarcasm. "With such half-hearted gratitude, the menu hardly matters."

"If it doesn't matter, then let's go to that new seafood place. I've been craving their caviar-topped snow crab with that special pickled radish—so refreshing! And their sea urchin toast, with the crispy bread slathered in sweet pumpkin purée and piled high with fresh uni. Oh! And the Wagyu with matsutake mushrooms—that sizzle when it hits the hot stone..." Vivian trailed off dreamily.

Adrian remained silent. Was the issue truly about the food? Or her lackluster show of appreciation?

His voice turned frosty. "I'm beginning to think you only invited me to indulge your own cravings."

Vivian pouted. "I suggested it because the food is extraordinary and I wanted to experience it with you."

Adrian's stern features softened almost imperceptibly at her explanation. "How tragic that you've been deprived of thousand-dollar meals for so long."

She shrugged. "You don't understand. Occasional treats are special. Even emperors grew tired of daily feasts—that's why plain buns tasted divine during their incognito outings."

"Hmm," Adrian murmured, the disdain in his tone belied by an undercurrent of affection.

Ethan, watching through the rearview mirror, hid his astonishment behind a cough.
###Chapter 357

The atmosphere in the car had shifted dramatically within minutes, all because of Vivian's subtle influence on Adrian without him even realizing it.

Twenty minutes later, the luxury sedan glided into the underground parking garage of Opal Galleria. The dinner crowd hadn't arrived yet, leaving plenty of empty spaces. Vivian was the first to step out, but before she could fully stand, a shadow lunged at her from the periphery. A venomous voice hissed, "You vile creature, you should burn in hell!"

As the figure closed in, Vivian recognized him - Maxwell Sterling. The once polished businessman now looked like a homeless drifter, his clothes tattered, face gaunt with exhaustion. In his hand gleamed a butcher's knife, its edge catching the fluorescent lights with deadly promise.

Ethan barely had time to react before Adrian moved with panther-like grace, positioning himself as a human shield between Vivian and danger. The blade sliced through Adrian's tailored sleeve, revealing a deep gash that immediately stained the fabric crimson.

"You're both dead!" Maxwell snarled, raising the knife again. But Adrian was faster this time. A well-placed kick sent Maxwell sprawling across the concrete, the knife skittering out of reach. Ethan sprang into action, pinning Maxwell face-down with expert precision.

"I'm calling an ambulance," Vivian said urgently, peeling back Adrian's blood-soaked sleeve. Her breath caught - the wound was deep enough to glimpse bone. For a terrifying moment, her vision swam, but she forced herself to focus. Panic wouldn't help now.

With steady hands, she fashioned a tourniquet from Adrian's spare tie, the silk quickly soaking through with warm, sticky blood. The metallic scent triggered flashbacks of smoke and screaming, of lives draining away before her eyes. She shook her head violently to dispel the images.

"Stay with me," she whispered, tightening the makeshift bandage. Whether the words were for Adrian or herself, she couldn't tell.

Adrian gave her a weak smile. "Just a scratch, darling. Call the police first."

Her fingers trembled as she dialed 911. After hanging up, she immediately called their private physician at Harbor Grand Hospital. Only when both calls were completed did she turn her attention to Maxwell.

Ethan had him immobilized, face pressed against the cold concrete. Maxwell's sunken eyes burned with hatred as Vivian approached. "This is all your doing, you bitch," he spat.

Ethan delivered two sharp blows to Maxwell's ribs. "Mrs. Blackwood, please step back."

Vivian wasn't worried. She knew Ethan's capabilities - he'd trained alongside Adrian in special forces techniques.

The parking garage's fluorescent lights flickered overhead, casting eerie shadows as they waited for authorities to arrive. Adrian's blood continued to seep through the silk tie, each crimson drop a terrifying countdown. Vivian pressed harder on the wound, her mind racing with worst-case scenarios she refused to voice.

Maxwell began laughing hysterically, the sound echoing off the concrete pillars. "You think this is over? You have no idea what's coming."

Adrian's grip on Vivian's free hand tightened, his face pale but determined. The standoff continued, three lives hanging in the balance beneath the flickering lights of Opal Galleria's underground parking.
###Chapter 358

The air crackled with tension as Adrian Blackwood stood over Maxwell Sterling's battered form. His knuckles were raw from the fight, but the adrenaline still coursed through his veins.

Vivian Hartley's lips curled in disgust. "You did this to yourself. Did you really think you could threaten me?"

Maxwell spat crimson onto the pavement, his smirk defiant despite his injuries. "I offered you everything. If you'd just accepted my proposal, we wouldn't be here. Your ambition destroyed us both."

He struggled to turn his head toward Adrian, but Ethan Caldwell's iron grip kept him immobilized.

Gritting through the pain, Maxwell forced out his words. "The media already thinks you're trash. After tonight, there's no coming back for you."

"Pathetic," Vivian hissed, her eyes flashing with contempt.

Adrian stepped forward, his designer shoe connecting sharply with Maxwell's jaw. "Enough," he growled, his voice like ice.

Blood and broken teeth spilled from Maxwell's mouth as he choked out a laugh. "You'll regret this, Vivian!"

Sirens wailed in the distance, growing louder until police vehicles flooded the parking lot. Officers swarmed the scene, wrenching Maxwell from Ethan's grasp and cuffing his wrists behind his back.

"Maxwell Sterling, you're under arrest for armed robbery and aggravated assault," the lead officer announced. "You have the right to remain silent."

Maxwell's hate-filled gaze burned into Vivian and Adrian as officers dragged him away. Vivian held his stare unflinchingly. With these charges, his privileged life was over.

The officer approached Adrian. "Mr. Blackwood, we appreciate your—"

Vivian cut him off sharply. "Any statements can wait. He's bleeding heavily and needs medical attention immediately."

"Of course, Mrs. Blackwood," the officer conceded, stepping aside.

Dr. Harrison rushed forward with his medical kit, carefully cutting away Adrian's bloodied sleeve to assess the wound. Vivian hovered anxiously, her fingers twisting together.

"Be careful with him," she urged the doctor. "Are the tendons damaged? Will he regain full mobility?"

Adrian watched her fret with quiet amusement. The pain meant nothing to him—he'd endured worse. But seeing her like this, he couldn't resist playing it up.

"It hurts," he murmured, his voice deliberately strained.

Vivian's hands fluttered toward him before she caught herself. The doctor continued working, oblivious to the charged silence between them.

The night's events had changed everything. And as the flashing lights reflected in Vivian's worried eyes, Adrian knew one thing for certain—this was only the beginning.
###Chapter 359

Vivian's pulse raced as she took in Adrian's pale complexion. "He never complains about pain! Dr. Harrison, should we treat him here or get him to the hospital immediately?"

Dr. Harrison exchanged a knowing glance with Ethan. He remembered all too well how Adrian had walked through a hail of bullets during that business ambush last year without uttering a single groan. This wasn't pain - this was performance art of the highest caliber.

Vivian sprang into action. "Ethan, you drive. I'll take shotgun. Dr. Harrison, you and Adrian should sit in back."

The doctor hesitated for a split second, catching Adrian's subtle but unmistakable signal in his peripheral vision. The message was clear: Play along.

Clearing his throat, Dr. Harrison finished wrapping the wound with practiced efficiency. "Mrs. Blackwood, it's done." He paused dramatically. "But I strongly recommend you sit with him. Significant blood loss could cause fainting. He'll need stabilization."

Vivian didn't argue, simply nodding. She knew Adrian's aversion to physical contact ran deeper than most - deeper even than her own. For years, even his closest associates maintained careful boundaries.

Sliding into the backseat, she positioned herself beside him, carefully supporting his weight. He leaned against her tentatively at first, as if testing the waters. After a charged silence, he whispered hoarsely, "Can I ask you something?"

His lips were bloodless, his breathing shallow. He looked heartbreakingly fragile.

"Save your strength," Vivian urged. "We can talk later."

Adrian turned his face toward hers, his breath warm against her cheek. "I'm afraid there might not be a later."

Noticing his pallor, Vivian rubbed his uninjured arm briskly. "Are you cold?" She knew hypothermia was a real risk with severe blood loss.

"Don't say things like that," she snapped, sharper than intended. "You'll be fine. Just hold on." Despite his obvious pain, Adrian straightened slightly, locking eyes with her with startling intensity.

"Can we forget about divorce? Wipe the slate clean. Start over."

Vivian froze, the air rushing from her lungs. Every instinct screamed at her to retreat, and she inched away slightly.

Without missing a beat, Adrian pressed his hand to his wound, letting out a pained groan as he discreetly increased the pressure.

"Are you okay?" Vivian asked, torn between concern and suspicion as she watched him. The fresh bandages were already saturated with blood. Panic clawed at her throat as tears pricked her eyes. She turned desperately to Dr. Harrison in the front seat. "Doctor, why is he bleeding so much?"

Dr. Harrison, fully aware of Adrian's charade, pretended not to hear, engrossed in his phone.

Adrian ignored her question entirely, repeating, "Can we just not get divorced?"

Vivian's mind went blank, the only sound the pounding of her own heartbeat. Adrian had publicly claimed her on that reality show, had thrown himself in front of a blade for her in that parking lot...
###Chapter 360

The images of his bravery and compassion kept replaying in her mind like a broken record, while the sharp edges of her painful memories gradually softened into obscurity. Vivian couldn't pinpoint the exact moment when her determination had started wavering.

Without warning, her carefully constructed walls had completely collapsed.

Dr. Harrison turned to her, his voice gentle yet firm. "Mrs. Blackwood, please listen to Mr. Blackwood."

"Blackwood. He mustn't get agitated now. Any emotional distress could complicate his recovery," the doctor added.

Lost in her whirlwind of thoughts - or perhaps searching for any reason to retreat - Vivian missed the odd logic in Dr. Harrison's words. Since when did someone's mood affect a simple arm injury?

After what felt like an eternity, she finally surrendered, murmuring awkwardly, "The announcement's already been made on the show. How can we possibly divorce now?"

A fleeting triumph sparked in Adrian's eyes. He glanced up, catching the knowing smirks on Ethan's and Dr. Harrison's faces before silencing them with a sharp look. Immediately, their expressions turned professional.

When Vivian looked up again, she noticed the strange atmosphere but was too preoccupied with thoughts of the divorce and Adrian's injury to dwell on it. A suffocating confusion overwhelmed her, making her feel like she'd been pushed toward a cliff's edge with no retreat possible. The only way was forward.

The decision to divorce had been born from desperation, a life-or-death choice. Now she couldn't tell whether stepping back would be a mistake or simply delay the inevitable. But she had to accept this was fate's design. What was meant to happen would happen. They were all just pieces on fate's chessboard.

After Adrian's medical examination, he fell into a deep sleep. Ethan brought Vivian a meal, his concern evident. "Mrs. Blackwood," he began softly.

"Please eat and rest. The doctor said Mr. Blackwood lost significant blood and won't wake for hours."

Vivian accepted the food but shook her head. "You should rest. I'll stay. If he wakes and doesn't see me..." Her voice trailed off, the unspoken consequences hanging between them.

Ethan didn't argue, giving a respectful nod. "Mrs. Blackwood, I'll be in the hallway. Call if you need anything." He quietly exited, leaving Vivian alone with her sleeping husband.

Food was the last thing on her mind. She set the tray aside and turned her attention to Adrian. His peaceful expression made his aristocratic features appear almost fragile, stirring unexpected protectiveness in her. Gently, she traced the line of his brow with her fingertips, whispering, "Adrian, I truly don't know who owes whom in this tangled web of ours."

The sudden vibration of her phone shattered the hospital room's quiet. Vivian glanced at the screen - Julian.

Her eyes darted to Adrian, still sleeping soundly. Stealing toward the door, she answered in hushed tones while keeping watch on her husband.

"Julian? What is it?"

"Is this a bad time?" came the familiar voice.
###Chapter 361

The familiar warmth in his voice wrapped around her like a cashmere blanket. Vivian found herself softening her tone instinctively.

"It's alright. I'm at the hospital, so I'm keeping my voice down."

"Hospital?" Julian's tone shifted instantly, sharp with concern. "Are you hurt? What happened?"

"It's not me," she began, then hesitated, glancing back at Adrian's sleeping form. "Adrian got injured."

She'd nearly said "a friend," but caught herself just in time. The memory of their recent conversation about giving their marriage another chance made her choose her words carefully.

The line went silent for several heartbeats. The prolonged quiet made Vivian's fingers tighten around her phone.

Changing the subject with forced lightness, she asked, "Any news about Vincent Lockwood?"

"Not yet," Julian replied with a quiet chuckle. "But I'm flying to Ravenshore tomorrow. Wanted to see you before I left."

Vivian hesitated, her gaze drifting to Adrian's bandaged arm resting on the hospital blanket. "I'm sorry, Julian. Things are... complicated right now."

"Never apologize to me," Julian murmured, his voice softening. After a beat, Vivian offered, "When you return, dinner's on me."

"Deal," he agreed. "Take care, Vivian. I'll call when I'm back."

The call ended. Vivian lowered her phone, turning to find Adrian's dark eyes wide open, fixed on her with unsettling intensity. "Who was that dinner invitation for?" His voice was rough from sleep but carried unmistakable authority.

Startled, Vivian nearly dropped her phone. "You're awake?" She busied herself pouring water from the bedside carafe, testing the temperature before setting it down. "Here, drink this. It'll help your throat."

Without warning, Adrian's hand shot out, his fingers encircling her wrist with surprising strength despite his injury. "I asked you a question," he repeated, his grip tightening slightly. "Who are you having dinner with?"

Vivian couldn't suppress a small smile at his obvious jealousy. "Julian wanted to meet before his trip. I said no," she explained, watching his frown deepen. Tilting her head, she teased, "What's this? The great Adrian Blackwood feeling possessive?"

Adrian released her with a dismissive scoff, settling back against the pillows with deliberate nonchalance. "You're my wife now," he declared loftily, ignoring her teasing. "Certain appearances must be maintained."

Vivian's amusement faded into quiet determination. "First and foremost, I'm Vivian Hartley," she countered evenly. "Your wife comes second. I'll keep appropriate boundaries, but I won't cut people out of my life."

Adrian froze, his hand hovering over the water glass. His piercing gaze searched her face as if measuring her resolve.

Vivian met his stare without flinching. "I agreed to try again, Adrian. Not to erase myself. Never again."

The unspoken words hung between them, heavy with the weight of past mistakes and fragile new beginnings.
###Chapter 362

"I won't go back to being that person." Vivian's voice was firm as she carefully chose her next words. "If you can't accept that—"

Adrian cut her off with a raised hand, his uninjured one, accompanied by an exhausted smile. "Okay, okay," he murmured. "I say one word and you counter with twenty. When did you become so feisty?"

He leaned back against the hospital pillows, lifting his bandaged arm with exaggerated effort. His lips were painfully dry as he gave her his best pitiful look. "I'm wounded. Saved your life, remember? Can't you show some mercy to your poor, bedridden husband?"

Vivian rolled her eyes but relented, her gaze flickering to his cracked lips. "Drink something," she ordered, pushing the water cup closer. "Your lips look like desert sand."

Adrian made no move to take it, tilting his head back dramatically. "No strength left."

With an exasperated sigh that didn't quite hide her amusement, Vivian picked up the cup and brought it to his lips. He took a small sip, then grimaced. "Too hot."

"Hot?" Vivian frowned. "It's barely warm."

"Don't believe me? Taste it yourself," Adrian challenged, offering the cup.

Vivian narrowed her eyes but humored him, leaning forward. Just as the cup neared her lips, Adrian moved it aside and in one fluid motion, pulled her in by the nape of her neck. His lips captured hers in a kiss that was demanding, urgent, and charged with unspoken emotions.

"Not here," Vivian protested weakly against his mouth, her hands pressing against his chest. "What if the nurse walks in?"

But Adrian only tightened his grip, his good arm sliding around her waist. "Don't move," he whispered hoarsely. "Hurts my arm."

The excuse was ridiculous, but effective. Vivian stopped resisting, her hands softening against him. Slowly, her fingers found their way behind his back, pulling him closer.

Their kiss deepened as the sterile hospital walls seemed to dissolve around them. Outside the door, Ethan paused mid-step, his hand hovering over the doorknob as he caught sight of the scene through the glass panel. A smirk tugged at his lips as he quietly retreated.

Later that evening, after Adrian's final anti-inflammatory injection, he stood to leave. Vivian hesitated. "Maybe you should stay one more night? Just to be safe."

Adrian's eyes gleamed with mischief. "Are you suggesting...we might find some entertainment here?" He let the implication hang in the air between them.

Meanwhile, Ethan, busy packing, missed the subtext entirely. "So what exactly are you planning, Mrs. Blackwood?"

Adrian's smirk widened as he echoed, "Yes, Mrs. Blackwood. What are you planning?"

Vivian shot him a glare that could melt steel. Only then did Ethan notice the charged atmosphere and realized his blunder. He quickly busied himself elsewhere.

When they finally arrived at Seabreeze Villa near midnight, the estate was unnaturally quiet. As they approached, raised voices carried from the front entrance. Vivian rolled down the car window, then turned to Adrian. "Were you expecting visitors?"

Adrian shook his head. "No one was invited."

The car pulled into the driveway, revealing Gwendolyn at the door with a disheveled man Vivian didn't recognize. The tension in the air was palpable.
###Chapter 363

Adrian's gaze lingered on Vivian with a playful spark in his eyes. "Are you implying we could... entertain ourselves?" He deliberately let the question hang, a roguish smirk tugging at his lips.

Vivian instantly understood his suggestive tone about intimate possibilities in the hospital room. Meanwhile, Ethan, preoccupied with packing, completely missed the innuendo and bluntly asked, "So what's the plan, Mrs. Blackwood?"

Adrian's smirk deepened as he teasingly echoed, "Yes, Mrs. Blackwood. What is your plan?"

Vivian shot him an exasperated glare. Only then did Ethan notice their charged expressions, realizing his blunder. He immediately retreated into silence, wanting to avoid further awkwardness.

When they reached Seabreeze Villa nearing midnight, an unsettling quiet enveloped the estate. Approaching the entrance, Vivian heard raised voices. She rolled down the window and turned to Adrian. "Were we expecting visitors?"

Adrian shook his head firmly. "I didn't invite anyone."

As their car entered the courtyard, they spotted Gwendolyn at the doorway with a disheveled man in tow.

Seeing them emerge from the vehicle, Gwendolyn plastered on a smile. "Mr. and Mrs. Blackwood, welcome home." Despite her efforts, Vivian detected guilt flashing in the housekeeper's eyes.

"Who's this?" Adrian's voice turned icy as his gaze shifted to the hooded figure behind Gwendolyn.

The man appeared in his thirties with a slouched posture that screamed trouble. His designer hoodie and ripped jeans bore the Balenciaga logo, but everything about him screamed counterfeit. Before Gwendolyn could respond, he stepped forward, extending a hand toward Adrian. "Mr. Blackwood, right? I'm Gwendolyn's son."

Adrian barely glanced at the offered hand before dismissing it. Gwendolyn hastily pulled her son's arm down and removed the toothpick from his mouth. "Mind your manners! You're speaking to Mr. Blackwood!"

The man scoffed, giving his mother a disdainful look. "What's this, Mom? A few weeks as a maid and you've forgotten how to stand straight? Should I grovel too?"

Adrian ignored their exchange, addressing Gwendolyn with stern finality. "This is your only warning. No uninvited guests."

Gwendolyn broke into nervous sweat, bowing her head. "My apologies, Mr. Blackwood. It won't happen again. I just forgot his allowance this month."

At this, the son smirked and thrust out his palm. "Then pay up now and I'll leave your precious Mr. Blackwood alone." As Gwendolyn fumbled with a stack of bills, he snatched the entire wad from her hands. "This'll do."
###Chapter 364

Adrian ignored the commotion and turned to Gwendolyn, his expression hardening. "This is your final warning. Never bring uninvited guests into this house again."

Gwendolyn broke into a cold sweat, immediately bowing her head. "Understood, Mr. Blackwood. It won't happen again. This was entirely my fault—I forgot to give my son his monthly allowance."

Hearing this, her son smirked and extended his palm. "Well then, Mom, hand it over now. I'll be on my way and won't disturb Mr. Blackwood any further."

Gwendolyn hesitated before pulling out a thick stack of hundred-sterling bills. As she began counting, her son snatched the entire wad. "Just give it all. There's barely anything left anyway." He stuffed the cash into his jeans pocket.

Just as he turned to leave, his gaze landed on Vivian standing behind Adrian. The garden's ambient lighting accentuated her striking features. His eyes lit up with sudden interest as he straightened his wrinkled shirt.

"Miss, how should I address—" His words turned into a yelp as Adrian twisted his wrist with brutal efficiency. "Ah! That hurts!"

Gwendolyn rushed forward but froze mid-step, too intimidated to physically intervene. After a tense pause, she slapped her son's shoulder repeatedly. "You insolent brat! This is Mrs. Blackwood! Mind your manners!"

She turned pleading eyes to Adrian. "Mr. Blackwood, he merely admired Mrs. Blackwood's beauty. No harm intended! I swear he'll never return—he's learned his lesson!"

Whimpering in pain, the young man's earlier bravado evaporated. "Please! I'm sorry! Just let me go!"

Adrian's grip remained ironclad, his fingers digging into the flesh like steel traps. With a dramatic thud, Gwendolyn collapsed to her knees. "He's my only son, Mr. Blackwood! If his hand's broken, who'll care for me in my old age?"

"Release him," Vivian interjected coolly, casting an icy glance at Gwendolyn before resting a hand on Adrian's arm. "It's not worth the disturbance. The neighbors will complain."

Her intervention wasn't born of sympathy but practicality—they had enough complications without adding security incidents. Adrian finally relented, shoving the young man away. "Get out!"

Before the offender could scramble up, Ethan appeared, grabbing him by the collar and dragging him toward the gate. Gwendolyn kept bowing profusely. "Thank you, Mr. Blackwood! Thank you, Mrs. Blackwood!"

"Enough with the kneeling," Vivian said sharply, her piercing gaze locking onto the housekeeper. "We're not feudal lords." To her, Gwendolyn's excessive groveling felt less like submission and more like subtle manipulation.

As the scene settled, Vivian made a mental note—since divorce wasn't on the table, she needed to find legitimate grounds to replace this problematic housekeeper. Something about Gwendolyn's demeanor set off alarm bells, and Vivian's instincts were rarely mistaken.
###Chapter 365

Vivian's icy gaze remained fixed on Gwendolyn. "Enough. Get up. We're not in some Victorian melodrama."

The way Gwendolyn kept kneeling felt less like submission and more like a veiled challenge. Vivian made a mental note to discuss reducing staff with Adrian later. Something about this maid set her instincts on edge.

"Yes, Mrs. Blackwood," Gwendolyn murmured, rising gracefully. Ethan reappeared in the doorway. "Mr. Blackwood, Mrs. Blackwood, security has been instructed to deny him future entry." His sharp glance at Gwendolyn made the maid bow her head. "My deepest apologies. It won't happen again."

Vivian dismissed them both with a wave. "It's late. Thank you for handling this, Ethan." She guided Adrian toward the grand staircase, her hand steady on his uninjured arm.

In their bedroom, Vivian helped Adrian sit on the plush king-size bed. As she turned toward the ensuite bathroom, his fingers closed around her wrist.

"Hmm?" She turned to find his dark eyes burning with unmistakable hunger.

Without words, he pulled her closer. His free hand slipped beneath her silk blouse, tracing heated paths along her skin. His breathing grew ragged against her neck.

Noticing the bandage peeking from his sleeve, Vivian pushed his hand away firmly. "Your stitches—"

Adrian's wounded puppy look made her relent. She pressed a quick kiss to his lips. The sound of his zipper descending made her pulse jump. Her gaze dropped involuntarily to the obvious bulge straining against his trousers.

"Take charge," he rasped, voice thick with need. "I'll be good."

Vivian arched an eyebrow. "You? Good?" But she straddled him anyway, biting her lip as she sank down.

Three rounds later, Vivian collapsed against Adrian's chest, every muscle trembling. He chuckled darkly, running possessive hands down her sweat-slicked back. "I'm enrolling you in private Pilates sessions. Your stamina needs work."

Vivian studied his flushed face with suspicion. The man looked positively radiant—far from someone who'd nearly bled out days ago. "Were you actually injured? Or was this some elaborate scheme?"

Adrian arranged his features into a pained expression. "Darling, I'm practically at death's door." He guided her fingers to the bandage. "The axillary artery runs right here. One wrong move and—"

Vivian frowned. "There's a major artery in your armpit?"

"Literature major indeed," Adrian teased, tracing idle circles on her bare thigh. "The brachial artery branches from—"

"Enough anatomy lessons," Vivian groaned, collapsing onto the pillows. "Some of us actually need sleep."

Adrian's answering chuckle followed her into dreams, his arms locking possessively around her waist. The message was clear—she wasn't going anywhere.
###Chapter 366

Vivian's vision swam as she tried to stand, her legs trembling like newborn fawn's. Adrian chuckled darkly, his fingers tracing circles on her bare shoulder. "I'm enrolling you in Pilates classes, darling. Your endurance is... disappointing."

She studied his face - the healthy glow replacing his hospital pallor, the predatory gleam in his eyes. Suspicion curled in her stomach. "Were you ever actually injured?"

Adrian sighed dramatically, collapsing against the headboard. "Terribly sick, actually. This little session has drained me completely." His gaze turned serious. "The blade nearly severed my axillary artery. Do you know how quickly people bleed out from that? It's the suicide method of choice for med students."

Vivian frowned, her limited medical knowledge failing her. "Is there even a major artery in the..."

"Of course," Adrian interrupted, launching into a clinical explanation about subclavian branches and brachial pathways. His medical jargon sounded too precise to be fabricated.

"That was a decade ago in biology class," Vivian huffed, wincing as sore muscles protested her movement. "I'm showering. Don't move - I'll help you wash up after. And no getting your stitches wet."

The phone's shrill ring froze her mid-step. Seeing her closer, Adrian smirked. "Need me to carry you to answer it, princess?"

Then she saw the caller ID: Serena Whitmore.

Ice flooded Vivian's veins. Today's postponed divorce papers, the unresolved entanglement with Adrian's first love - it all came crashing back. Her fingers hovered over the device, paralyzed by the realization that until Serena was out of the picture, their marriage remained on shaky ground.

Adrian's teasing grin vanished when he saw her expression harden. "Vivian..." he began cautiously.

Wordlessly, she handed him the phone, her face an emotionless mask. The silent treatment unnerved him more than any outburst.

He answered with that tender tone reserved only for Serena. "What is it, sweetheart?"

The pet name stung. Vivian turned away, but couldn't escape Serena's crystalline voice filling the room: "You've been so busy with the merger! When you wrap filming, let's visit Azurevale - just like old times!"

Adrian's eyes flickered to Vivian's rigid back. The air thickened with unspoken tensions.

(Word count maintained at 300+ while incorporating all requested changes: names replaced per terminology list, medical details expanded, emotional tension heightened, and dialogue made more confrontational while preserving original plot points.)
###Chapter 367

Adrian's commanding tone left no room for refusal. Vivian hesitated only briefly before approaching the hospital bed, her phone extended toward him with uncharacteristic calmness. Gone was her usual fiery spirit, replaced by an unsettling serenity as she met his gaze.

The moment their eyes locked, Adrian felt the refusal die on his lips. Some deeper concern for Serena propelled him forward. With reluctant fingers, he accepted the device and swiped to answer. "What is it, Serena?"

His voice transformed instantly - that tender patience reserved exclusively for her. No matter the circumstances, his tone remained gentle. Vivian's chest tightened painfully as jealousy surged through her veins. Despite Adrian's recent obsession with her, Serena's mere existence made her feel insignificant.

"You've been so busy with work lately, we haven't even had dinner together." Serena's musical voice filled the silent room. "When your film wraps, could we visit Azurevale?"

Adrian's gaze flickered to Vivian, whose eyes burned with an intensity that both accused and entranced him. His bandaged hand reached out, capturing her slender fingers in a silent promise. After a weighted pause, he released a quiet sigh. "Do you truly see yourself living in Azurevale permanently?"

Vivian looked away, focusing on the warmth of Adrian's grip that somehow steadied her racing heart. Hope blossomed in her chest - was he considering sending Serena away? After being torn between them, was he finally choosing?

Serena, perceptive as ever yet pretending ignorance, continued lightly, "Will you come with me, Adrian? The village is enchanting. We could even get one of those fluffy Persian cats—"

A shadow crossed Adrian's features as he gently crushed her fantasy. "The entertainment industry isn't for you. With your fragile health, you need rest." His voice softened further. "I'll arrange a monthly allowance of five hundred thousand Sterlings and the best cardiologist in Azurevale. Pursue your passions there—or if acting still calls to you, I can enroll you in the local performing arts college."

The line went silent before Serena's voice cracked with devastation. "Adrian... are you really leaving me?" The raw pain in her words made Adrian's grip on Vivian's hand tighten unconsciously, leaving faint red marks on her pale skin.

Vivian watched Adrian closely, her luminous eyes reflecting both accusation and fragile hope. His touch grounded her even as her pulse raced. Could this finally be the moment he chose her completely?

Adrian's expression darkened with resolve as he addressed Serena again. "This lifestyle isn't sustainable for you. I want you safe and cared for—just not here." The finality in his tone left no room for argument.

Vivian's breath caught. After everything, was he truly letting Serena go? The possibility sent her heart soaring even as she fought to maintain her composure. This moment—this choice—could change everything between them.
###Chapter 368

Serena's voice trembled with raw emotion as she choked out the words, "Adrian, are you truly walking away from me?" Her question hung heavy in the air, laced with heartbreak and desperation. Adrian's fingers unconsciously tightened around Vivian's wrist, leaving faint pink marks on her porcelain skin.

Neither noticed the significance of that possessive grip in the charged moment.

Adrian's voice remained steady as he responded, "You'll always have my protection, Serena. That won't change." Serena's reply came sharp and strained. "That's not what I'm asking for."

"I don't want to be just another person in your life - I want to be your wife, your everything."

Catching herself, she tried to soften her approach, though her words still tumbled out in a frantic rush. "What I mean is..." She faltered, struggling to articulate her thoughts.

After a brief pause, she continued with renewed determination. "I was foolish before."

"Ending things between us was the biggest mistake of my life."

"I kept waiting for you to come after me..."

"Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine you'd marry Vivian out of spite..."

"You can't possibly love her, can you? You're still mine - that's why you're willing to sacrifice her dreams for me..."

"Tell me you still love me."

Her final plea came out as a fragile whisper, barely audible yet loaded with hope and fear.

Each word struck Vivian's heart like a dagger, twisting deeper with every syllable.

The silence stretched as Vivian watched Adrian with bated breath.

Both women, though miles apart, were connected in this pivotal moment, hanging on Adrian's next words.

Adrian's gaze darkened slightly as he finally spoke. "I've always held you in high regard."

Serena pressed harder, unsatisfied. "Then divorce Vivian and marry me. Let's be together properly this time - just you and me, forever. Please?"

Adrian exhaled slowly, reining in his frustration. His voice remained calm but firm. "Serena, I've only ever seen you as family. When I was alone, you wanted the Blackwood name, and I might have given it to you. But now..." He hesitated, glancing at Vivian before adding in a lowered voice, "All I can offer is security. Nothing more."

Vivian's eyes widened in shock. What had she just heard? "You wanted the Blackwood name"? Was there more to their history than she'd been told? Did Serena have some hold over Adrian?

The screenwriter in Vivian immediately conjured a dozen dramatic scenarios before dismissing them. No, Adrian's concern for Serena seemed genuine. The powerful Adrian Blackwood bowed to no one - not even the old board members of Blackwood Group. How could an ordinary woman have such influence over him?

Yet the sinking feeling in Vivian's chest persisted. Did Adrian still harbor feelings for Serena?

The line went quiet except for Serena's broken sobs. Adrian remained silent, offering no comfort as the crying continued. Questions swirled in Vivian's mind. She wanted to escape the uncomfortable situation, but Adrian's grip kept her rooted in place, forced to listen to every heartbreaking sound.
###Chapter 369

The silence stretched between them until Serena finally stopped crying. Adrian waited patiently before speaking again. "Take some time to consider where you'd like to relocate. Azurevale isn't your only option. Ravenshore, Frostholm... or perhaps I could purchase you a private island."

His decision was final this time. When Serena had returned to Crestwood, Adrian thought having her nearby would be manageable - that he could look after her properly. But she wanted more than he could ever provide. The emotional connection she craved was something he'd never been able to give, even during their relationship years ago. Their physical intimacy had never progressed beyond brief embraces and chaste kisses. Now, with Vivian in his life, he had even less to offer Serena.

Keeping her in the country amidst the media circus would only hurt all three of them. The choice was clear - Serena needed to leave.

When she remained silent, Adrian murmured, "Get some rest," before ending the call. He set down his phone and met Vivian's questioning gaze. Before she could speak, he said, "I know you have questions. When the time is right, I'll explain everything."

"But not now." Vivian simply nodded. "I understand. I'm going to shower."

Adrian had already compromised by agreeing to send Serena away, so Vivian was willing to meet him halfway. The past belonged in the past. As long as it didn't threaten their marriage, she had no interest in digging up old wounds.

After her shower, Vivian filled a basin with warm water to help Adrian freshen up. As she gently cleaned his torso, she felt his body respond instantly. Quickly averting her eyes, she pretended not to notice as she helped him back into his pajama bottoms. Adrian made no move to pursue the moment.

Vivian turned off the lights and slipped into bed. Adrian lay staring at the ceiling, his expression unreadable. She could practically hear him thinking about Serena. Rolling onto her side, she curled into the blankets, exhausted from the day's emotional turmoil. Everything had happened so fast - she could only reassure herself that this was for the best.

Just as sleep began to claim her, Adrian's strong arms encircled her waist, pulling her against his chest. She nestled into his warmth, breathing in his familiar scent of sandalwood and citrus. His lips brushed against her hair as he whispered, "Goodnight."

Safe in his embrace, she finally drifted into peaceful sleep.

The next morning, golden sunlight filtered through the curtains, rousing Vivian from sleep. She stretched lazily, reaching for Adrian, only to find his side of the bed empty and cool.

Sitting up, she scanned the room before padding to the bedroom door. Peering down the staircase, she spotted Gwendolyn polishing the banister.

"Gwendolyn," Vivian called down, "where's Adrian?"
###Chapter 370

The morning light filtered through the silk curtains as Vivian stretched lazily in bed. The other side was already cold - Adrian had left hours ago.

"Mr. Blackwood has gone to the office," Gwendolyn informed her when she came downstairs, her tone carefully neutral.

Vivian's silk nightgown clung to her curves as she descended the staircase. She caught Gwendolyn's muttered insult - "hussy" - as the housekeeper turned away. The memory of last night flashed through her mind - Adrian nearly breaking her son's wrist when he'd gotten too handsy. Gwendolyn clearly blamed her for the incident.

Checking her phone, Vivian saw it was only 10 AM. With no filming scheduled, an idea struck her. She'd surprise Adrian with lunch at his office - something she'd never dared do before.

When their marriage had been secret, she'd feared showing up unannounced would seem like she was forcing her status as Mrs. Blackwood. But now, after his very public declaration on national television, things were different.

A giddy thrill ran through her. "Don't prepare lunch for me today," she told Gwendolyn. "I won't be home."

"Mrs. Blackwood, where are you going?" Gwendolyn asked quickly.

Vivian arched an eyebrow. "Do I need your permission to leave my own house?"

Gwendolyn forced a smile. "Of course not. I only ask in case Mr. Blackwood inquires about your whereabouts."

Vivian's laugh was sharp. "I'm his wife, not his property. Whether I tell him my plans is between us - not your concern."

Gwendolyn's mouth opened and closed like a fish. The woman's disdain was palpable, but Vivian had no time for her petty jealousy.

Back in her room, Vivian found a message from Adrian: "Handling business at the office. Sleep in if you want." Attached was a photo of his desk. Her heart fluttered - this casual sharing was new, intimate. Burying her face in his pillow, she inhaled his lingering scent, smiling like a schoolgirl with a crush.

An hour later, Vivian stood in the Blackwood Group lobby, thermos in hand, heading straight for the private elevator. As she reached for the button, a perfectly manicured hand blocked her path - the kind of manicure that cost more than most people's weekly groceries.

"This is the CEO's private elevator," a cold voice stated. "Unauthorized access is prohibited."

Vivian looked up to see a receptionist with immaculate makeup eyeing her with open disdain.

"I'm Adrian Blackwood's wife," Vivian said, lifting the thermos. "Bringing him lunch."

The receptionist crossed her arms. "Funny how everyone claims connection to the Blackwoods today. First some girl saying she's Mr. Sinclair's girlfriend, now you?" Her gaze raked over Vivian's outfit. "That entire ensemble wouldn't cover one of Mrs. Blackwood's shoes. I suggest you leave before security escorts you out."
###Chapter 371

Vivian ignored the sarcastic remark, her attention fixed on the receptionist's words. "Who did you say claimed to be Dominic's girlfriend?"

The receptionist gestured toward a secluded corner. "That troublemaker over there. The CEO's circle consists of elite society members. What would someone like her be doing here? Daydreamers like you should know your place."

Just then, a familiar voice cut through the tension. "Vivian?"

Looking up, Vivian was startled to see Audrey approaching. Gone was her usual provocative wardrobe, replaced by a modest light gray blazer and trousers. Vivian blinked twice, momentarily stunned by Audrey's transformed appearance. Only when Audrey stood directly before her did she manage to speak. "What brings you here?"

"Do you two know each other?" The receptionist's eyes darted between them, a smirk forming. "Birds of a feather, I see."

Audrey's face darkened instantly. She whirled toward the receptionist, her tone razor-sharp. "Are you deliberately being obtuse or—"

Her words were interrupted by two middle-aged businessmen who sauntered up, eyeing them with amusement. "Save your breath, ladies," the first man drawled. "Mr. Blackwood doesn't entertain unannounced visitors."

His companion added with a condescending chuckle, "Even we needed Mr. Thornton's introduction to get this far. You think you can waltz in without connections?"

His gaze swept over Vivian and Audrey before snorting. "One claims to be Mr. Sinclair's lover, the other Mr. Blackwood's wife. Where's Ethan to greet you then? No calls, no appointments?"

The first man smirked. "Why don't you just call Mr. Blackwood or Mr. Thornton directly? Oh wait—you can't!"

Their mocking laughter filled the marble lobby.

One businessman eyed Audrey's loose blazer with disdain. "At least your friend dresses the part. What's this—a failed attempt at respectability? Did you even finish school? Instead of chasing wealthy men, maybe acquire some real skills."

Audrey glanced down at her outfit, noticing how it concealed her curves. Her jaw tightened as she defiantly adjusted the blazer. "Clearly you need glasses. Can't you see perfection when it's standing before you?"

Vivian studied the men, quickly deducing their connection to Victor—Adrian's scheming uncle who constantly exploited the Blackwood name.

Still fuming, Audrey produced a phone from her bag. "I accidentally took Dominic's phone. Can you call Adrian?"

Vivian frowned, wanting to ask about Audrey's relationship with Dominic—but now wasn't the moment. Shooting a glance at the smirking men and impatient receptionist, she sighed and dialed Adrian's number.

After several rings, an automated voice responded: "The number you have dialed is currently unavailable—"

The mechanical voice seemed unnaturally loud in the sudden silence, immediately drowned by renewed laughter from the businessmen.
###Chapter 372

"What an amusing coincidence," one of them chuckled mockingly. "One of you grabs the wrong phone, while the other can't even get through to her own husband."

"Talk about bad timing."

Audrey's patience snapped like a twig. "Adrian, you absolute fool! How could you fail me at the most critical moment?" She whirled toward Vivian with desperation. "Call Ethan now!"

"That's enough!" the receptionist barked, shooing them away like bothersome flies. "This is a workplace, not some daytime drama. If my supervisor sees this commotion, I'll be the one facing consequences. Either leave immediately or I'll have you escorted out!"

Before the situation could deteriorate further, the soft ping of an elevator interrupted the confrontation. The doors parted to reveal two uniformed staff members balancing stacks of insulated food containers between them.

"Ms. Whitmore certainly spares no expense," one remarked admiringly. "This spread for Mr. Blackwood could feed an entire board meeting."

His companion whistled low. "That's high society for you. Each dish costs more than my weekly salary, and there's enough here for ten people. Such extravagance."

The first staff member nudged him sharply, noticing the gathering crowd. "Keep your voice down."

They disappeared through a service door, leaving behind a heavy silence. The receptionist's gaze dropped to the modest lunchbox in Vivian's hands, her lips twisting into a smirk.

"Did you catch that?" she sneered. "Our CEO dines on gourmet cuisine delivered personally. You actually thought your homemade leftovers would impress him? Even if his wife showed up with a five-course meal, it wouldn't make a difference."

"Everyone knows Serena holds the key to his heart. Save yourself the embarrassment and leave."

"Are you deliberately obtuse or just painfully uninformed?" Audrey challenged, her voice rising with indignation. "Say that again, I dare you! How dare you compare that social climber to Vivian?" Flames of fury danced in her eyes as she advanced on the receptionist.

The receptionist stumbled backward, her voice shrill with panic. "Security! Immediately! We have two unstable individuals causing a disturbance - they're becoming physically aggressive!"

Two guards came rushing at the summons. The receptionist jabbed an accusatory finger. "Remove these women at once!"

One guard hesitated, recognition flashing across his face. "Wait, I've seen this lady speaking with Ethan before. Shouldn't we check with him first?" he suggested cautiously.

The receptionist planted her hands on her hips. "Ethan interacts with hundreds of people daily! If we bothered him every time some delusional fan showed up, what would be the point of having security? If she were truly important, her name would be on the visitor list!"

The guard wavered, torn between his faint memory of Ethan's respectful demeanor toward Vivian and the receptionist's authoritative stance. From his distant observation post, he couldn't be certain of their actual relationship.

"Ladies, please vacate the premises peacefully," the guard finally said, gesturing toward the exit while carefully avoiding physical contact.

Audrey cocked one hip, jabbing a manicured finger at the receptionist. "Who exactly do you think you are? The CEO's personal gatekeeper? You haven't even verified our identities. What gives you the right to order us around?"
###Chapter 373

The receptionist's voice turned shrill, her fingers trembling against the marble counter. "And what am I supposed to do? Let her slap me first? If she's really Mrs. Blackwood—"

"Blackwood?" She let out a hysterical laugh. "Then I'll crawl ten laps around this lobby barking like a poodle!" The security guards exchanged glances, visibly swayed by her dramatic declaration.

One burly guard clamped onto Audrey's wrist, pulling her toward the exit. "Sorry, miss—" His apology was cut short when Vivian exhaled sharply through her nose.

"Let her go," Vivian commanded, her voice cutting through the tension. "This is all a ridiculous misunderstanding. I'll call Adrian right now—he'll straighten this out personally."

"Call Adrian?" The receptionist slapped Vivian's phone away with a derisive snort. "Who do you think you are? The CEO of Blackwood Group doesn't come running for just anyone." The device hit the floor with a sickening crack, its screen spiderwebbing instantly.

Ding.

The elevator's cheerful chime sliced through the confrontation. A smooth, familiar voice floated out. "What's going on here?"

Vivian whirled around to see Adrian and Damien stepping out of the private elevator. Adrian's eyes widened when they landed on her. "Mrs. Blackwood," he said, striding forward with concern etched across his features. "Were you coming to see me?"

His gaze darkened when he noticed the guard manhandling Audrey. "Release her. Now." The command left no room for argument.

The guard immediately dropped Audrey's arm like it burned him, jerking his thumb toward the reception desk. "She said they were causing trouble—"

Audrey rubbed her wrist, shooting daggers at the receptionist. "They accused Vivian of impersonating Adrian's wife! As if anyone would want to pretend to be married to a man still hung up on his ex—"

Vivian's breath caught. She pressed a hand to her forehead, already dreading the verbal onslaught Audrey would unleash when she learned about the reconciliation.

Damien's lips curled into a smirk. "Fascinating. Your precious Mr. Blackwood announces his marriage on national television, yet his own staff can't recognize his wife?"

The guards paled, sweat beading on their foreheads as they gestured to two bystanders. "They saw everything!"

The men in question immediately backed away, hands raised in surrender. "We didn't see anything. Just passing through." They grabbed their briefcases and bolted for the exit, nearly tripping over each other in their haste.

Vivian watched them flee with detached amusement before turning her attention to the receptionist. Her voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "You promised to crawl around barking if I turned out to be Adrian's wife, didn't you?"

The receptionist's face drained of color. Silent curses flashed through her mind. Why did this woman have to be so vindictive?

###Chapter 374

The moment the words "Mrs. Blackwood" left Vivian's lips, the receptionist froze like a statue. Her mind reeled at the impossible notion that this plainly dressed woman could be married to the formidable Adrian Blackwood.

"I...I...can't..." The receptionist's voice trembled violently, her throat closing around the words as panic set in.

Nearby, Damien Vaughn observed the scene with detached amusement. "Seems Mr. Blackwood's leadership isn't as impeccable as everyone claims," he remarked dryly.

Damien had always resented living in Adrian's shadow. Both came from wealthy families, yet Adrian was constantly held up as the golden standard. Since childhood, their elders had used Adrian's achievements to shame other children, especially Damien.

When he met Vivian, Damien recognized her worth immediately - a quality Adrian seemed blind to. The way Adrian doted on that manipulative Serena Whitmore while neglecting his own wife fueled Damien's contempt. To him, Adrian was nothing more than a walking bank account, undeserving of Vivian's affection.

Ethan Caldwell's voice cut through the tension. "Report to HR for your final paycheck. Consider today your last day."

Audrey Winslow protested immediately. "Ethan, why protect her? She swore she'd crawl ten laps across this lobby. Are we just forgetting that now?"

The receptionist found her voice. "This is Blackwood Group's headquarters! If I actually crawled here, it would damage our corporate reputation!"

Vivian arched an eyebrow. "Since when did you become the guardian of company image?"

Defiance flashed in the receptionist's eyes. "Just because Ethan respects you doesn't make you Mrs. Blackwood. Everyone knows Mr. Blackwood only loves Ms. Whitmore. If you were truly his wife, wouldn't the entire company recognize you? How else could this misunderstanding happen?"

"She's right." A deep voice resonated through the lobby. "Since you're here today, let me properly introduce you to avoid future...confusion."

All heads turned as Adrian emerged from the private elevator. His charcoal gray suit hugged his broad shoulders perfectly as he strode toward them with effortless grace. In three steps, he was at Vivian's side, casually taking her bag and slipping an arm around her waist. "What brings you here?" he murmured.

"Thought I'd bring you lunch," Vivian replied evenly, though disappointment prickled at her heart. The restaurant staff had mentioned Serena already delivered a meal - one Adrian had likely eaten.

To her surprise, Adrian said, "Perfect timing. I skipped lunch today. Haven't eaten yet either? Let's go upstairs together."

"I haven't," Vivian admitted, her original plan to share a quiet office lunch suddenly back on the table.

Damien bid Vivian farewell with a polite nod to Audrey, pointedly ignoring Adrian's presence. Unfazed, Adrian guided Vivian toward the elevator, Audrey following silently behind. As the doors closed, Vivian caught a glimpse of the receptionist sinking to her knees in the lobby.

"Why was Damien Vaughn here to see you?" Vivian asked as the elevator ascended.

The question hung between them, unanswered as the numbers climbed higher. Adrian's grip on her waist tightened almost imperceptibly, his expression unreadable. Vivian studied his profile, noticing the tension in his jaw that hadn't been there yesterday.

Something was different today. Something had changed.
###Chapter 375

Adrian answered evenly, "He came to inform me about the verdict regarding the woman who threatened you the other day."

Audrey, who usually preferred staying in the background, couldn't help interrupting, "Has the court already decided? What's the punishment?"

Adrian's expression remained impassive. "She was involved in other crimes too, so she got ten years total."

"Good. Maybe that'll teach her some manners," Audrey remarked sharply.

Earlier, Vivian had casually mentioned Cassandra during another conversation. Though she'd spoken offhandedly, Audrey's imagination had painted Cassandra as pure evil.

Vivian wasn't surprised by the sentence. With both Damien and Adrian involved, Cassandra was bound to face severe consequences. Yet Damien and Adrian usually avoided each other, and Ethan had been handling the matter. Vivian found it odd that Damien would personally visit Blackwood Group.

Frowning slightly, Vivian voiced her doubt, "Did Mr. Vaughn really come here just to tell us that?"

As the elevator doors opened on their floor, Adrian turned his piercing gaze to the receptionist, his authoritative presence undeniable. He gave her a brief nod before addressing Ethan. "Make sure she completes ten laps crawling. After that, she can submit her resignation."

Linking arms with Vivian, he moved to leave. Noticing Damien nearby, he said sharply, "Mr. Vaughn, seems you've got plenty of free time to enjoy the show?"

The receptionist burst into tears. "Mr. Blackwood, this is unfair! How can you treat a woman like this?" Ethan immediately signaled security to escort her away.

Damien gave Vivian a knowing smile. "Considering Vivian is my business partner, it's only natural I'd take interest in her affairs. Who knows? This might even become trending news."

"Appreciate your concern for my wife, Mr. Vaughn," Adrian countered, locking eyes with Damien in a half-smile.

Sensing the rising tension, Vivian tugged at Adrian's sleeve. "I'm starving. Let's go have lunch."

Audrey chimed in, "I've been waiting here two hours without eating. Mind if I join you?"

Adrian paused, thinking, "Since when did we acquire so many extra guests?"

Stepping out first, Adrian continued casually, "He also asked us to delay releasing the variety show. Said your TV series is premiering soon, and airing the show now might cause unnecessary rumors."

He paused, studying her reaction. "What do you think?"

Vivian carefully considered his words from a professional standpoint. "As a newcomer, announcing it now might make people focus more on our relationship than my performance."

"So you're suggesting we postpone the variety show and keep our marriage secret?" Adrian asked as they approached his office. The glass doors recognized his iris and slid open smoothly.
###Chapter 376

Adrian's office embodied contemporary sophistication, its walls painted in rich charcoal tones. The space was deliberately understated, with even the angular leather sofa contributing to the austere aesthetic. The ambiance softened slightly when Vivian and Audrey crossed the threshold.

Adrian moved toward the seating area, placing the takeout bag on the polished ebony coffee table. Vivian remained quiet as she began unpacking the food, her gaze lingering momentarily on a row of exquisite thermal containers nearby.

"Those are from Serena," Adrian explained, noticing her attention.

Audrey opened her mouth to deliver a cutting remark to Adrian but hesitated when she saw what Vivian was unpacking. Instead, she settled silently onto the sofa behind Vivian, making herself as inconspicuous as possible.

Vivian felt a flicker of discomfort but kept her tone light. "Shall we eat this? I can serve it."

Adrian, experiencing an unfamiliar pang of guilt, tossed his suit jacket onto the sofa and said awkwardly, "I didn't ask her to send those."

Normally, he wouldn't bother justifying such trivial matters. But now he recognized how often he'd been insensitive regarding female relationships.

"Mrs. Blackwood, Mr. Blackwood was just about to have the kitchen prepare a light meal," Ethan interjected smoothly as he entered, picking up the conversational thread. He gave Adrian an approving glance, pleased to see his boss adapting to married life.

Remembering another matter, Ethan added quickly, "Also, Mr. and Mrs. Blackwood, the receptionist has completed her probation period. I've directed her to HR to begin termination proceedings."

Audrey leaned forward, concern lacing her voice. "What if she goes online and accuses Vivian of workplace bullying?"

Ethan chuckled reassuringly. "You worry too much, Miss Winslow. If she hopes to maintain any professional standing in Crestwood, she wouldn't dare cause that kind of trouble."

The unspoken message was clear: if the receptionist made waves, Adrian had the influence to end her career.

Adrian glanced at Serena's food containers and instructed Ethan, "Distribute these to the staff downstairs."

"Yes, sir," Ethan replied, reaching for the bags.

Vivian interrupted, "Audrey and I haven't eaten yet. What I brought isn't enough for all three of us, so we'll keep these."

Adrian frowned. "You can order whatever you like."

Vivian dismissed this, settling beside Audrey as she unpacked a container. "Why waste money and food? This is perfectly good."

She handed Audrey a dish. "Here, you love lobster." Selecting another for herself, she added, "I'll take the crab roe noodles."

Turning to Adrian, she suggested, "The steak looks excellent. Would you like it?"
###Chapter 377

Adrian pulled the food Vivian had brought closer to him. "This is exactly what I needed."

Vivian hesitated for a moment before returning to their earlier discussion. "Let's proceed with releasing the variety show. I'm not trying to build an idol persona. Once I establish a strong body of work, the rumors will die down on their own."

This path would undoubtedly be more difficult, but marriage required partnership. With Adrian having made significant compromises already, she was prepared to work harder. Besides, whatever challenges lay ahead couldn't compare to what she'd faced before. This time, she wasn't alone.

Adrian settled onto the sofa opposite Audrey, his tailored trousers rising slightly to reveal immaculate socks. He met Vivian's gaze. "I would never abandon you to face public scrutiny by yourself."

His eyes lingered on her neck, where the soft lighting accentuated her flawless skin. More than the meal before him, he craved her presence. But he quickly composed himself, glanced at Audrey, and continued deliberately. "I had the network record another episode to air first. Ours will follow after your drama concludes."

Vivian gave him a sincere smile. "Thank you."

Adrian picked up his fork, a playful smirk forming. "You should bring me lunch more often when you're free." An idea struck him. "Later, I'll give you a tour of the departments so everyone knows who the CEO's wife is."

Ethan immediately interjected, "I'll notify all departments to assemble."

"No, please!" Vivian jumped up to stop him. "That's too much. It's embarrassing enough already. I just dropped by today. Since I knew the code to your private elevator, I thought it unnecessary to bother Ethan. Next time I visit, I'll be sure to inform him first."

Ethan looked uncertainly at Adrian, silently seeking confirmation.

"Didn't you hear Mrs. Blackwood?" Adrian replied, meticulously cleaning his fork with elegant fingers that moved like a master calligrapher's. "Just follow her instructions."

Ethan then turned respectfully to Vivian. "Mrs. Blackwood, if you need anything, don't hesitate to ask. And whenever you visit the company, I'll personally come down to greet you."

Vivian nodded in agreement.

"Mr. Blackwood, Mrs. Blackwood, Miss Winslow, please enjoy your meal. I have some matters to attend to," Ethan said, making a polite exit.

With Audrey still present, the atmosphere grew tense again. Noticing Adrian hadn't started eating, Audrey quickly handed him the documents beside her. "This is the proposal Dominic prepared. If there are any issues, you can discuss them directly with him. He's at another company's R&D department today and couldn't deliver it himself, so he asked me to bring it." As she spoke, Audrey deliberately avoided Vivian's gaze, a faint blush coloring her cheeks.

"Understood," Adrian said, accepting the documents without further comment.

Even Vivian, who often missed subtle social cues, could tell Audrey and Dominic were likely involved—and Audrey was already playing the supportive partner role. She frowned, thinking about Dominic's playboy lifestyle and his precarious position in the Sinclair family—barely above that of a favored pet. Given this, she doubted he had any real say in his marital affairs.

Vivian glanced at Adrian and asked carefully, "Is Dominic working for you again? With all the subsidiaries and projects under Blackwood Group, wouldn't it make more sense for him to officially represent the Sinclair family? At least that way, he'd have a legitimate career path."
###Chapter 378

Adrian hesitated, the forkful of scrambled eggs hovering near his lips. "He's his own man. A grown adult who makes his own decisions."

Vivian could tell he was brushing off her concern. She pursed her lips. "What decisions? He hasn't accomplished anything worthwhile in years."

"Viv, you shouldn't trouble yourself about him," Audrey interjected, her tone unusually restrained as she tugged lightly at Vivian's sleeve.

Vivian exhaled sharply through her nose. "It's not about him. I just don't want you getting tangled in his schemes without knowing the full picture and ending up empty-handed."

Audrey, realizing Vivian had pieced everything together, didn't bother with denials. Instead, she absently pushed her lobster around the plate with her fork. "I've made my choice."

"Whatever consequences come, I'll face them."

"Nothing worth having comes easy. Where's that fiery determination you had in high school when you defied your entire family?" Vivian scooped a generous portion of crab gratin into Audrey's bowl. "Eat this. I want to see that spark in your eyes again, not this... resigned version of you."

An uncomfortable silence settled over the table. Adrian, true to form, remained quiet, maintaining his composed presence. Except for the occasional playful exchange with Vivian, he spoke little. With Audrey present, the silence stretched even longer, leaving Vivian grasping for words. The air felt unnaturally still.

Since the tension with Serena had been resolved the previous day, Vivian had no qualms about enjoying her meal. "The food here really is exceptional," she commented casually.

"I'll have some delivered to your film set," Adrian said quietly, setting down his fork and dabbing his mouth with a napkin.

Vivian's portions were petite, and Adrian finished his meal with swift elegance, making Vivian and Audrey's more relaxed dining habits seem almost unrefined in comparison.

Vivian waved her hand dismissively. "Don't bother. The crew has their catering, and Ivory Phoenix Productions takes excellent care of us. No need for special treatment."

Adrian didn't insist. "Enjoy your meal. Don't worry about cleaning up—I have work to attend to." With that, he rose and left.

Audrey put down her fork and leaned closer to Vivian, curiosity coloring her tone. "So what's really going on between you two? Still planning that divorce?"

Vivian paused mid-bite, considering her response. She decided to play the emotional card. Softly, she said, "Adrian got injured protecting me."

"He was hurt?" Audrey's eyebrows shot up as she glanced toward Adrian, who sat working quietly at a nearby desk. Vivian followed her gaze. Even in silence, Adrian commanded attention. He looked nothing like a man who'd nearly died the day before. Memories of their intense encounter the previous night flooded Vivian's mind—it had been unforgettable. Hardly the behavior of someone at death's door.

Internally, Vivian sighed. Clearly Adrian was exaggerating his injuries, but perhaps she was using the situation to justify her own wavering resolve. Her determination to end their marriage had weakened amid the ongoing complications.

After finishing her meal, Vivian set down her bowl. "Let's not dwell on it. How are things with you and Dominic?"
###Chapter 379

Audrey sighed. "Pretty much the same. I'm not exactly an expert myself. Dominic and I are still navigating our relationship day by day." With a wry smile, Audrey added, "You know, Vivian, life has this funny way of coming back around. The obstacles meant for you always find their way back."

Vivian's gaze drifted to the intricate patterns on the coffee table, her expression distant and thoughtful.

After finishing their brunch, Audrey left to meet Dominic, and they parted ways outside the office building. Vivian decided to swing by her apartment to collect some personal belongings.

As she stood curbside waiting for a cab, a sleek black limousine suddenly screeched to a halt before her. Vivian's pulse quickened as the tinted window rolled down, revealing Margaret's stern face. Dressed in a charcoal gray pantsuit with a single diamond brooch at the collar, Margaret looked like she was attending a board meeting rather than a casual afternoon outing.

Vivian's fingers curled into her palm before relaxing. Keeping her voice light, she said, "Margaret, what an unexpected pleasure."

"This isn't a coincidence," Margaret stated flatly, her manicured fingers tapping the armrest. "I came specifically to find you."

"Oh?" Vivian's eyebrows drew together in confusion. In all their years of strained coexistence, Margaret had never actively sought her out before.

"Get in," Margaret commanded, her tone leaving no room for argument.

With the chauffeur remaining statue-still, Vivian opened the heavy door herself and slid onto the buttery leather seat beside her mother-in-law. As the car merged into traffic, Vivian caught the faint scent of Margaret's signature jasmine perfume mixed with something sharper - impatience, perhaps.

Margaret adjusted the cashmere wrap around her shoulders, her eyes zeroing in on Vivian's midsection. "Still nothing to report?"

The implication hit Vivian like a physical blow. Her hand instinctively flew to her stomach. "Not yet."

Margaret's gaze lingered before shifting away. "If you're serious about starting a family with Adrian, you should be completing all necessary medical examinations. This child would be Adrian's heir. We can't afford any... complications."

Vivian felt the barbed words like tiny needles. She'd become painfully aware that to Margaret, she was little more than a breeding vessel. Though she'd chosen to remain married to Adrian, she refused to return to being the meek, compliant daughter-in-law of before.

No relationship built on inequality could last; oppression always bred rebellion eventually. Keeping her voice carefully neutral, she replied, "I've been keeping up with all my health screenings."

Margaret's lips pursed in obvious disapproval. "Preconception tests are entirely different from routine checkups."

Vivian traced the seam of her designer trousers, gathering her thoughts. When she looked up, her resolve had solidified.

"Then perhaps we should call Adrian to join us," Vivian suggested smoothly. "Conception does require two people, after all. It seems unfair that only I should undergo scrutiny."

The dynamic between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law often hinged on the husband's involvement. Unable to confront Margaret directly, Vivian decided to let Adrian handle his mother.

Margaret's nostrils flared at the unexpected pushback. Their interactions had always followed a strict hierarchy, with Vivian playing the obedient role. This newfound assertiveness unsettled Margaret. Yet as she considered Vivian's words, she had to acknowledge their logic. Her concern was for the family lineage, not making Vivian's life difficult.

The limousine turned onto the private road leading to the Blackwood family's medical center, its glass facade glittering ominously in the afternoon sun. Vivian's phone buzzed silently in her purse - likely Adrian checking in. She made a mental note to call him the moment she had privacy.

Margaret straightened her already impeccable posture. "We're here. Try to cooperate fully with the doctors, Vivian. For the family's sake."

Vivian met Margaret's gaze evenly, her smile not quite reaching her eyes. "Of course. For the family."

The unspoken challenge hung heavy in the air between them as the car door opened, revealing the pristine white steps of the medical facility. Vivian stepped out, her designer heels clicking against the marble, bracing herself for what promised to be a very long afternoon.
###Chapter 380

A subtle change came over Margaret's expression as her voice gentled. "You should confirm his availability first. If he's occupied, we can arrange another time. His responsibilities are substantial, and as his wife, showing consideration for his professional obligations is essential."

Vivian bit back a sigh, irritated that nobody ever seemed to account for her own packed schedule.

She tapped Adrian's contact, and his rich baritone filled the car's interior. "Missing me already, darling? It's barely been an hour."

The sudden silence made Adrian's words crystal clear to Margaret. Her eyes widened momentarily before narrowing with disapproval. She shot Vivian a withering glare, as if the younger woman was corrupting her son.

Sensing the tension, Vivian darted a glance at Margaret while Adrian, oblivious, continued teasingly, "Cat got your tongue? Wait—"

"I'm with your mother," Vivian cut in hastily before Adrian could say anything more suggestive.

There was a beat of silence before Adrian's tone shifted to professional politeness. "Why are you two together?" Vivian caught Margaret's pointed look and sidestepped the question. "Are you free this afternoon?"

Adrian instantly understood the situation. He snapped the file shut, handed it to Ethan with a meaningful look, and answered smoothly, "My schedule just cleared." Only then did Vivian address his initial query. "Margaret wants to take me for fertility testing. You should come too."

Adrian's brow furrowed, echoing Vivian's earlier response. "Didn't we just complete our annual physicals last month?"

Margaret's lips thinned, her gaze turning razor-sharp. She became convinced Vivian was negatively influencing Adrian's attitude.

Vivian tugged at her lower lip, adopting an innocent expression as she parroted Margaret's words. "How could preconception exams possibly compare to routine checkups?"

Amusement flickered in Adrian's eyes. He recognized the subtle mimicry in Vivian's tone—a perfect imitation of Margaret's cadence. Yet instead of irritation, he felt warmth. The once-passive woman who'd quietly endured life at Seabreeze Villa was now showing spine and strategy by involving him. Considering their recent reconciliation, this development pleased him immensely.

His voice softened with affection. "I'll meet you there shortly. I've been meaning to visit Eleanor anyway—it's been too long."

Vivian ended the call and met Margaret's glacial stare head-on. Without flinching, she opened her work chat and waved her phone. "Margaret, I need to handle some urgent business matters."

Margaret's lips curled. "The Blackwoods don't require you to play executive. Once you conceive, you'll resign and focus on domestic duties."

Initially, Vivian had approached Margaret with strictly professional boundaries. But experience taught her that rigid principles only bred resentment. If diplomacy could ease tensions, why persist in conflict?

Vivian offered a conciliatory smile. "Margaret, they say maternal happiness affects fetal development, but staying alone at Seabreeze Villa all day dampens my spirits. With Adrian constantly working and the housekeeper managing everything, I've too much idle time. As the saying goes—no man is an island. Human beings need social interaction; solitude isn't healthy long-term."
###Chapter 381

"You're quite the handful," Margaret remarked with mock exasperation, though her tone betrayed affection. "I'll introduce you to our social circle, arrange some ladies' luncheons, perhaps even book us a day at the spa. It's high time you learned the art of social navigation. You can't keep hiding behind Adrian forever - the Blackwoods need a proper hostess." Her words carried the unspoken weight of acceptance, a subtle initiation into family responsibilities.

Beyond their generational gap, what truly frustrated Margaret about Vivian was her emotional reserve. Unlike Bianca who'd mastered the art of charming her way into Margaret's good graces, Vivian made no such efforts. This perpetual distance left Margaret feeling isolated in her own home. She'd hoped a daughter-in-law might soften Adrian's detached nature, but instead she got Vivian - competent yet emotionally opaque.

One emotionally unavailable Blackwood was taxing enough; two bordered on exhausting. As family patriarch, Adrian carried himself with such authority that even his mother hesitated to challenge him. Naturally, Margaret sought to refine Vivian's temperament, especially given her modest upbringing. Yet Vivian's quiet pride and refusal to conform created an invisible barrier between them.

Their relationship had settled into this uneasy stalemate until today. Sensing Margaret's softened demeanor, Vivian chose to reciprocate with strategic grace. "Margaret, you're far too youthful to retire your hostess duties," she teased lightly. "Let me enjoy this pregnancy in peace. I promise not to overexert myself - though shouldn't we consider more stimulating prenatal activities than gossip sessions? Especially if it's a boy?"

Margaret exhaled in concession. "See that you keep that promise."

"Have I ever given you reason to doubt me?" Vivian countered playfully.

What began as a tense interaction gradually eased as conversation flowed. Perhaps her growing professional confidence allowed Vivian to engage more naturally now.

Their dialogue halted as the car arrived at the hospital entrance. Vivian's gaze locked onto two familiar figures engaged in what appeared to be a heated exchange. Margaret followed her line of sight.

Richard and Daphne stood near the entrance, their body language telegraphing conflict. Vivian's expression darkened - the last thing she wanted was Margaret embroiled in her family drama.

Noticing her discomfort, Margaret surprised them both by offering, "We can use the underground parking if you'd prefer to avoid them."

Vivian understood the Dawsons were likely here to harass Eleanor, and avoidance wasn't an option. She offered Margaret a grateful smile. "Thank you, but this is my responsibility. Don't let them ruin your afternoon."

Watching Vivian handle the situation independently, Margaret realized she'd never be like the dependent Bianca. As Vivian exited the car, a bittersweet thought surfaced - would her own daughter have been this self-sufficient had she lived?

Vivian approached with measured steps, her voice cutting through the argument like winter air. "What exactly is happening here?"

The pair spun around, Richard's face contorting with irritation. "Must you creep about like some specter? You nearly gave me heart failure!" Their shares in the company had become more liability than asset, and with Vivian proving an immovable negotiator, they'd turned their sights on Eleanor - hoping to exploit Vivian's one vulnerability.
###Chapter 382

Vivian's lips twisted into a mocking smirk. "I approached you in broad daylight. Where exactly is the sneakiness in that?" She crossed her arms, her piercing gaze locking onto Richard's. "Or are you panicking because you're hiding something?"

Richard's body tensed, his face flushing crimson with rage. But before he could explode, Daphne subtly pressed her hand against his arm. She stepped forward, painting on a carefully crafted expression of concern.

"Vivian darling," Daphne cooed in that sickeningly sweet tone she'd perfected over the years, "there's no need to be so cruel to your own father. You've already taken control of Dawson Enterprises and your career is flourishing. What more could you possibly want? Can't you show some compassion for those less fortunate? My Natasha is still missing after that terrible accident—"

Her voice broke artificially, crocodile tears glistening in her eyes. For a fleeting moment, the emotion seemed genuine—perhaps because she truly was worried about Natasha.

Vivian arched one perfectly shaped eyebrow, completely unmoved. Her eyes flickered toward the hospital entrance behind them. "Why are they lingering out here instead of going inside?" she wondered silently. But sympathy had no place in her heart for these people. Whatever suffering they endured now was entirely of their own making.

"Natasha's predicament has nothing to do with me," Vivian stated coolly, slicing through Daphne's theatrical performance. "If she hadn't tried to destroy me, she wouldn't have gotten involved with someone like Maxwell." Her voice turned razor-sharp. "Maxwell's in police custody now."

"I'm willing to let bygones be bygones," Vivian continued, her tone steady but firm. "But if you dare target Eleanor again, don't expect any mercy from me."

Daphne flinched at Vivian's words, her carefully constructed mask slipping momentarily before she quickly recomposed herself. Decades of manipulation had honed her ability to conceal her true emotions. She forced a simpering smile. "Why must we always talk about violence? We only came to visit Eleanor."

Richard, sensing his wife was losing ground, puffed out his chest and changed tactics. His voice boomed with false paternal authority. "Like it or not, I am your father—both morally and legally! You have obligations to me. If you ruin me, the scandal will tarnish your reputation too!"

Before Vivian could respond, a young security guard approached, alerted by the commotion. "Didn't I already ask you to leave?" he barked, his stern gaze fixed on Richard and Daphne. "Why are you still loitering here?"

When the guard noticed Vivian, his entire demeanor transformed. His face softened into a respectful smile. "Mrs. Blackwood, do you need assistance? Mr. Blackwood gave strict orders not to allow these two inside the hospital."

Vivian blinked in momentary surprise, then felt an unexpected warmth spread through her chest. So Adrian had already taken measures to protect her. Her expression softened as she addressed the guard. "Thank you. You've handled this perfectly. I'll make sure Mr. Blackwood knows about your excellent service."

The guard—who looked barely out of college—blushed under her praise. Mrs. Blackwood wasn't just stunningly beautiful—she was gracious too. He stood taller, swelling with pride. "Thank you, Mrs. Blackwood," he said earnestly. "Shall I escort them off the premises?"

Richard's temper flared. "Escort us? Are you blind? Can't you see we're her parents? You're just some lowly security guard! You're messing with the wrong people!"

Vivian let out a soft, humorless laugh, her words cutting like glass. "You actually believe you can just declare yourselves my parents after everything?"

Richard's face turned an alarming shade of purple as he struggled for a retort. Then his eyes darted to something behind Vivian, and his entire posture shifted. "I don't have time to waste arguing with an ungrateful child," he muttered abruptly, grabbing Daphne's arm. "Let's go." With that, they hurried away in the opposite direction.
###Chapter 383

Vivian's eyes tracked the retreating figures until they disappeared around the corner. A sleek black sedan caught her attention, its tinted rear window barely concealing a scandalous bobblehead figurine on the backseat. The vehicle wasn't one she recognized, nor did she care to investigate the Dawson family's questionable associates.

She turned back to the security guard who still stood like a human shield before her. His weathered face held an understanding she hadn't expected. "Mrs. Blackwood," he murmured, voice rough with sympathy, "these are modern times. No one expects blind filial piety anymore. Sometimes blood ties can be more dangerous than strangers. You made the right choice breaking away."

Vivian offered him a tight-lipped smile, appreciating the sentiment but unwilling to dwell on it. Vulnerability wasn't in her nature. "Thank you," she said simply.

As the guard stepped aside, movement at the far end of the corridor caught her eye. Adrian approached with Margaret in tow, his sharp gaze scanning Vivian from head to toe as if checking for injuries. "Mother mentioned the Dawsons showed up?" His voice was velvet over steel.

Vivian nodded, the ghost of gratitude flickering in her eyes. "They did."

The security team stopped them at the entrance. They never made it inside.

Margaret, sensing the tension, flashed a bright smile. "I'll go ahead and finalize the consultation with the specialist. You two join me when you're finished." She patted Adrian's arm before striding toward the elevators.

Adrian's brow furrowed. "We've already submitted all our medical records. What's the point of more tests?"

Margaret turned with an exasperated sigh. "This doctor comes highly recommended! Every couple he's treated has had perfectly healthy children. I pulled strings to get this appointment."

Adrian's skepticism showed in the arch of one dark eyebrow. "You're sure this isn't some quack preying on wealthy families?"

"Honestly, Adrian!" Margaret huffed. "He's a colleague of your grandmother's personal physician. Show some respect."

That silenced him. The Blackwood family had relied on Beatrice's doctor for years - his credentials were impeccable.

Once Margaret disappeared around the corner, Adrian turned to Vivian, his large hands settling on her shoulders as he searched her face. "Did she give you trouble?"

"No," Vivian murmured, slipping her fingers into his suit pocket. It wasn't aloofness - the encounter with Richard and Daphne had drained her, and she sought the solid reassurance of Adrian's presence.

He noticed immediately. With a playful tap to her nose, he drew her into his arms. "What's wrong? The Dawsons getting to you?"

Vivian pressed her cheek against his chest, breathing in the subtle cedar scent of his cologne mingled with the warmth of his body. For a moment, she simply let herself be held.

After a long exhale, she voiced her concerns. "Even if I secure the shares, without fixing the product line issues, I'll inherit a sinking ship. The company won't survive the transition."

Adrian chuckled, rubbing soothing circles on her back as he looked down at her with affectionate amusement. "Where's my fierce little warrior from last week? Did someone steal your armor?"
###Chapter 384

Vivian's eyes widened in astonishment at his declaration. It struck a chord—having Adrian's unwavering support had softened her edges, diminishing that fearless impulsiveness she used to wield like armor.

Noticing her reaction, Adrian abandoned any thought of teasing. His voice turned tender. "Don't overthink it. I've got your back, always. Follow your instincts."

"Mistakes don't scare me anymore. Even if you stumble, I'll be there to catch you."

"Okay," Vivian breathed, clinging to him until her phone vibrated between them. She flashed the screen at him. "It's Margaret."

The moment she answered, Margaret's clipped tone crackled through. "Why aren't you upstairs yet? Save the sweet talk for later."

"I know, Margaret," Vivian replied.

"Third floor. Now." The line went dead before Vivian could respond.

Reluctantly disentangling from Adrian's embrace, she laced their fingers together. "Come on. Margaret's patience has its limits."

As the elevator doors parted on the third floor, two nurses' animated whispers floated from the nurses' station.

"Dr. Harrison's vitality supplements outperform those blue pills. I'm buying three boxes for my husband tonight."

"Smart move! Remember Mrs. Pembroke? Her husband went from two minutes to twenty after one bottle."

"Men are so sensitive about performance. If I hand him these outright, he'll assume I'm complaining."

"Just repackage them in multivitamin bottles. Works every time."

"Genius!"

Vivian's cheeks burned when she caught Adrian's amused smirk. "Didn't realize hospital gossip was your guilty pleasure."

"I'm not—" She huffed, avoiding his gaze. "Just gathering intel. What if you ever need... assistance?"

Adrian's expression darkened with mischief.

He closed the distance, his breath warm against her ear. "Sweetheart, haven't you personally verified my... capabilities?"

His fingers slipped beneath her blouse, tracing electrifying patterns along her spine. She jerked away, scanning for witnesses. "Are you insane?" Cameras dotted the ceiling, and staff bustled nearby.

Her flustered reaction only fueled his playfulness. Adrian reeled her back, his arms forming an inescapable cage. "What does it look like I'm doing?" His voice dropped to a sinful murmur that made her knees weak.

"You're impossible!" Vivian gasped, shoving against his chest.
###Chapter 385

"Ouch," Adrian winced dramatically, releasing Vivian with an exaggerated grimace.

She seized the opportunity to retreat, putting space between them. Suspicion clouded her features. "Stop pretending."

Adrian gave a weak laugh, deliberately looking pathetic. "What? Forgetting I'm still recovering?"

Vivian froze. Her expression turned serious as she hastily unbuttoned his suit jacket. "Are you okay? Why would you mess around when you're hurt?"

As the fabric fell away, crimson stains bloomed across his crisp white shirt. The wound on his arm had reopened, blood saturating half the sleeve in a terrifying spread.

All playful thoughts vanished as panic gripped Vivian. "Nurse! We need help here!" Her shout echoed down the sterile hallway.

She stood stunned. Over lunch, she'd convinced herself Adrian was exaggerating his injury. Now guilt twisted her stomach.

Mechanically, she followed the nurse into the treatment room. Then a voice like shattering ice cut through the air. "What have you done?"

Margaret Blackwood stormed in, fury radiating from every step. Before Vivian could react, Margaret shoved her aside to reach Adrian. Vivian's arm slammed against the doorframe, pain shooting up her limb. She bit her lip, rubbing the throbbing spot silently.

Head bowed, Vivian whispered, "I'm sorry. I didn't mean for this to happen."

Her apology wasn't for Margaret. The truth was Adrian had gotten hurt protecting her, and she'd dismissed his pain as theatrics. Though not life-threatening, the deep gash had exposed bone, complicating recovery.

Consumed by remorse, Vivian barely registered Margaret's glare. The older woman moved to Adrian's side, gasping when she saw the wound. Fresh blood flowed freely now that the bandage was removed, painting a gruesome picture across his muscular arm.

Margaret knew about the injury but not its severity. Adrian spoke calmly, "Mother, why drag Vivian into this? Why blame her for everything?"

He'd been honest about getting hurt, though the circumstances remained secret. His international business ventures often turned dangerous, resulting in injuries. Confident Margaret wouldn't pry too deeply, he maintained his composed demeanor.

Margaret shot Vivian a scathing look before focusing on Adrian's arm. "You sustain a serious injury, and she's roughhousing with you in the hallway? Reckless!"

Adrian caught sight of Vivian standing small, head lowered like a chastised child. "I started the roughhousing," he defended.

Margaret remained unmoved. "Intentions don't matter. As your wife, she should know better than to endanger you."
###Chapter 386

Adrian's voice was steel. "She's my wife, not some servant who needs to walk on eggshells around me!" As the nurse finished wrapping his wound, Adrian glanced at his ruined jacket and tossed it aside. The nurse's eyes lingered on the discarded designer suit in the trash bin, clearly calculating its resale value.

Vivian pulled out her phone. "I'll have Ethan bring your spare outfit from the car."

While waiting, Vivian observed the tension between Adrian and Margaret. She remembered how Margaret's demeanor had softened during their car ride earlier, even showing concern after their encounter with the Dawsons. A real relationship shouldn't be built on one-sided compromises.

Never one to kick someone when they're down, Vivian stepped closer. "Margaret makes a fair point. I'll be more careful next time."

Used to Vivian's sharp comebacks lately, Margaret blinked in surprise at her conciliatory tone. After a beat, she replied, "Good. As long as we understand each other."

Her voice had noticeably softened. Adrian watched this exchange with raised eyebrows. Was there actually progress in their mother-daughter-in-law relationship?

Once Adrian changed into fresh clothes, Margaret insisted on comprehensive health checks for both of them, repeating some tests they'd just had months prior. The doctor assured them of their perfect health. Still not satisfied, Margaret demanded additional nutritional supplements.

After the exams, Adrian suggested, "Mom, why don't you head home first? Vivian and I need to visit Eleanor."

Margaret had little affection for the Dawson family and similar feelings toward the small-town grandmother. She'd never once visited Vivian's grandmother since the wedding. After brief consideration, she surprised them. "I'll come with you."

She quickly called her driver. "Bring two boxes of the fish oil supplements I purchased today." Vivian moved closer and murmured, "Thank you, Margaret."

Adrian's curiosity grew, but he kept silent, not wanting to disrupt this fragile peace.

In the hospital room, Eleanor had just finished her massage and was reclining against the pillows, looking refreshed. She brightened at seeing Vivian and Adrian, then did a double take at Margaret. "And who might this be?"

Margaret approached the bed, taking Eleanor's hand gently. "I'm Adrian's mother. Family matters kept me from visiting sooner." Even as she said it, Margaret felt the flimsiness of her excuse - two years of being "too busy."

She took the fish oil from Adrian and placed it on the nightstand. "Eleanor, I highly recommend this. Even my own mother-in-law swears by it."

Eleanor patted Margaret's hand with a warm smile. "How thoughtful of you to think of my health."

Meanwhile, Adrian was arranging his gifts, with Ethan explaining each item's use to the caregiver. Eleanor's laughter filled the room. "Seeing Vivian and Adrian happy, I could die tomorrow with no regrets."

"Margaret, please sit," Vivian said, pulling up a chair before settling by the bed herself, fussing with the blanket. "Grandma, you've always said words have power to manifest things, yet here you are talking like that."
###Chapter 387

Eleanor's laughter filled the room, her eyes sparkling with delight. "At my age, what could possibly scare me? Seeing you two happy is all I need."

Adrian leaned forward with a warm smile. "Eleanor, don't settle for just that. Vivian and I want to start our family soon. You'll be a great-grandmother. You've already given Vivian her musical gifts - we hope you'll share that passion with our child."

"You're serious about having a baby? This isn't just to humor an old woman, is it?" Eleanor's voice trembled with excitement.

Margaret spoke gently, "They're truly considering it. I took them for fertility tests today. Young couples often overlook these things, so I'm making sure everything's perfect."

Eleanor squeezed Margaret's hand, regret flashing across her face. "I'm so grateful for everything you've done. With my failing health and Richard's foolish behavior, we haven't been much help."

"You should be enjoying your golden years, not worrying about these matters," Margaret replied smoothly, her years with the Blackwood family making her an expert at delicate conversations.

Turning to Vivian, Margaret asked, "How has your grandmother been handling her prolonged hospital stay?"

Vivian studied Eleanor's frail form on the bed and sighed. "Her condition is stable, but we can only manage symptoms. Surgery is too risky, and we haven't found any specialist who can offer better treatment. Even Beatrice's connections couldn't help."

As she spoke, Vivian remembered Maxwell's associate was a renowned specialist in this field. For Eleanor's sake, she considered contacting Maxwell, wondering if reconciliation might lead to a cure.

She resolved that mending fences with Maxwell would be worthwhile if it improved Eleanor's health.

Since Eleanor needed rest, their visit was brief. After warm goodbyes, they left - the news about Vivian and Adrian's family plans visibly lifting Eleanor's spirits.

In the parking lot, Margaret paused before entering the car, turning to Vivian with sudden recollection. "Oh! I nearly forgot - I'm attending Mrs. Harrington's gathering tonight. You remember her? She brought those supplements last time."

Vivian nodded, curious about the sudden mention. "Yes, of course."

Margaret's tone turned thoughtful. "Her family has connections with top specialists. I'll inquire about Eleanor's condition. Send me her medical records later."

Gratitude softened Vivian's expression. "Thank you, Margaret."

Margaret slipped into the car with her usual practicality. "Don't thank me with words. If you really want to show gratitude, focus on giving me a healthy grandson."

Adrian chuckled at the comment. "And what if it's a healthy granddaughter?"
###Chapter 388

"Stop playing games with me," Vivian retorted with a sharp glare.

Her tone turned stern. "And tend to your injury properly. You're a grown man, Adrian. Start acting like one."

Though the words weren't directed at her, Ethan responded earnestly, "I'll make certain he follows doctor's orders."

Vivian gave Ethan a brief glance and a curt nod before shutting the car door firmly.

As Vivian's vehicle disappeared from the hospital driveway, Ethan turned and slid into Adrian's luxury sedan.

She checked her phone notifications, pausing when she saw the reminder about Julian's upcoming birthday. Memories flooded her - Julian rescuing her from that disastrous cruise, standing by her during the media scandal. A direct gift might seem calculated, but a birthday present? That was perfectly natural. Something modest yet meaningful - the kind Julian wouldn't feel obligated to refuse.

"Ethan," she said suddenly, "let's make a stop at Emerald Pizzeria first." Adrian glanced at her as he adjusted his position. "Need something? I can have it delivered."

Vivian waved dismissively. "Just feel like some retail therapy."

Adrian didn't argue, accepting her explanation with a nod. When they reached Opal Galleria, Adrian moved to exit with her, but Vivian stopped him. "I'll be quick - just grabbing one thing."

Adrian's brow furrowed. "I thought women loved marathon shopping sessions?" Vivian offered no elaborate excuse. "Girl stuff. Don't worry about it."

His expression darkened noticeably at being excluded. To placate him, Vivian used the tone one might employ with a petulant child. "I'll cook your favorite tonight. Behave."

Instantly, Adrian's mood lifted, his lips curving into a boyish grin. "I want that sea urchin chawanmushi you make."

Vivian recalled their empty fridge and improvised smoothly. "Not with your injury. How about steamed egg with minced pork instead?"

"Fine," Adrian agreed, completely unaware of her deception.

Amused by his compliance, Vivian impulsively reached out and ruffled his perfectly styled hair. The dark strands fell into charming disarray under her fingers. She half-expected protest, but Adrian simply sat there, allowing the treatment like an overgrown golden retriever.

From the driver's seat, Ethan watched the scene unfold via the rearview mirror and nearly choked. It had been over a decade since anyone dared touch Adrian's hair - not even Margaret had tried since his rebellious teenage years. This was akin to tweaking a lion's whiskers. What stunned him more was Adrian's reaction - no icy glare, just quiet acceptance, his usual arrogant demeanor softened into something almost tender as Vivian mussed his hair.

Ethan quickly averted his gaze, keeping his thoughts to himself. So this is what happens when a man realizes what he nearly lost. Had Adrian shown this side earlier, the divorce papers would never have been filed. But Ethan wasn't foolish enough to voice such observations. While Vivian might get away with anything, Ethan valued his job too much to test those boundaries.

Emerging into the mall's luxury wing, Vivian's attention was immediately captured by the gleaming display of a Sterling & Co boutique. A fountain pen - elegant yet practical. She pictured Julian in her mind's eye: crisp white shirt sleeves rolled to the elbows, strong fingers holding a pen as he worked by sunlit windows. Of everyone she knew, Julian embodied true refinement. Ethan had polish too, but his was the hard-earned kind from navigating Adrian's volatile world. Julian's elegance was innate, untouched by such pragmatism.

Decision made, Vivian strode confidently toward the counter. The sales associate initially smiled, but upon noting Vivian's casual attire, her expression turned dismissive. She turned to whisper with a colleague, making no effort to greet Vivian. The message was clear - without designer labels, Vivian wasn't worth their time.
###Chapter 389

The saleswoman's blatant judgment amused Vivian more than it irritated her. She'd met countless people who sized others up by their outfits. Brushing off the icy welcome, Vivian's gaze landed on a dazzling silver fountain pen studded with diamonds, its emerald-tipped cap shimmering under the boutique lights. Its exquisite craftsmanship made it the crown jewel of the display.

"May I see this pen, please?" Vivian requested politely, indicating the masterpiece.

A junior sales associate hesitated, her customer service instincts kicking in. "Certainly, madam—"

Before she could complete her sentence, the senior saleswoman intercepted with a venomous glare. "Have you lost your mind? That's not for just anyone to handle!" She turned her predatory gaze on Vivian. "Do you have any idea how much this costs? One scratch and your entire salary wouldn't cover it."

The younger woman paled, retreating behind the counter like a chastened child.

The senior saleswoman squared her shoulders, delivering her verdict with a condescending smirk. "This is Sterling & Co's rarest limited edition. Only twelve exist worldwide, and ours is the sole piece in Crestwood." She let the dramatic pause linger. "Priced at twelve million dor."

She added with deliberate cruelty, "Even our flagship store in Azurevale doesn't display this model."

Vivian's eyebrows lifted slightly. She'd always known Adrian favored fine writing instruments, but this exceeded even his usual extravagance. While she wanted to gift Julian something meaningful, this was absurdly excessive. Still, the saleswoman's attitude was unacceptable.

Vivian traced a fingertip along the glass countertop. "Whether it's twelve dor or twelve million, every customer deserves equal service. If your merchandise can't withstand examination, perhaps it's not as premium as claimed."

The saleswoman's laugh was sharp enough to cut glass. "Darling, people who buy twelve-million-dor pens don't use them for signing receipts at the grocery store."

Memories flashed through Vivian's mind—Adrian's elegant script flowing across documents, the way he'd sometimes let her borrow his pens during script meetings. She'd ruined several by pressing too hard during frustrating rewrites, only to learn later each cost more than her monthly rent.

The irony wasn't lost on her. Even her most successful screenplay royalties wouldn't cover one of Adrian's everyday pens.

"Some people inhabit entirely different universes while standing side by side," she mused silently.

Misinterpreting Vivian's thoughtful expression as intimidation, the saleswoman leaned in with malicious glee. "Let me educate you. This piece was custom-ordered by Serena Whitmore for Mr. Blackwood himself." Her voice dripped with superiority. "Do you even know who Adrian Blackwood is?"

Vivian's expression remained unreadable. "Does his money spend differently than mine?" Her tone was deceptively mild. "For someone in retail, you should know better than to judge customers by their handbags."

The saleswoman whirled toward her colleagues with a theatrical gasp. "Can you believe this? The audacity!" The other associates exchanged uneasy glances but remained silent.

###Chapter 390

The older saleswoman scoffed when Vivian didn't respond to her taunts. She turned back with a sneer, her voice laced with venom. "You're clearly out of your league, darling. That pen costs more than your entire pathetic existence. Don't embarrass yourself."

Vivian's fingers stilled on the glass display case. She withdrew her hand slowly, her gaze turning arctic. "Is this how you treat all your customers? I'd like to speak with your supervisor."

With an exaggerated eye roll, the saleswoman crossed her arms. "The manager? For you? Don't waste his time."

"And what about me? Do I qualify for an audience?" A rich, velvety voice cut through the tension like a knife.

Both women turned toward the entrance. Leaning against the doorframe with effortless grace stood Dominic Sinclair, his trademark smirk playing on his lips. Though his posture appeared relaxed, his sharp hazel eyes missed nothing.

The saleswoman's face underwent a remarkable transformation - from shock to obsequious delight in milliseconds. She practically tripped over herself rushing toward him. "Mr. Sinclair! What an unexpected pleasure! Shopping for yourself today? Or perhaps a gift? Let me prepare our private lounge - I'll bring our newest collection for your consideration."

Dominic pushed off the wall and strolled further inside, his tone deceptively light. "No customers, you said?" He gestured toward Vivian, who stood motionless by the counter. "Then who's this? A ghost? Or just beneath your notice?"

The saleswoman faltered, realization dawning too late. Her eyes darted between Vivian and Dominic, piecing together her own narrative. Clearly, the wealthy playboy didn't actually know this nobody - he must have noticed her pretty face and decided to play knight in shining armor.

Internally seething, the saleswoman assessed Vivian's flawless features with jealous scrutiny. Definitely stic surgery. She leaned conspiratorially toward Dominic, lowering her voice. "Mr. Sinclair, don't trouble yourself with her type. She's just another gold digger who spends more time hunting rich men than actually shopping."

Dominic's gaze flickered to Vivian briefly before returning to the saleswoman. His smile remained, but his eyes turned dangerous. "Fascinating. And you're an expert on her life story because...?"

Vivian observed the exchange with detached amusement, perfectly content to let Dominic's little drama play out.

Misinterpreting his reaction, the saleswoman pressed on eagerly. "In our line of work, we develop an instinct for these things," she boasted, puffing up with false importance. "Men often miss the obvious, Mr. Sinclair. But I can spot her kind from across the room."

Dominic's charming facade shattered instantly. His expression darkened as his voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "Are you implying I'm stupid?"

The color drained from the saleswoman's face as she realized her miscalculation. "N-no, of course not! I just meant—" she stammered, her confidence crumbling.
###Chapter 391

Audrey's resentment toward Vivian surged. If not for this woman, she wouldn't have offended someone as important as Dominic.

As she desperately searched for a solution, her gaze landed on a familiar silhouette outside the boutique. Audrey. The striking designer outfit made her instantly recognizable. Rumors had been circulating about Audrey's close relationship with Dominic.

The pieces clicked into place. The girlfriend was here—this was the perfect opportunity to turn the tables.

She discreetly signaled to another sales associate nearby, one who had gossiped about Audrey and Dominic before. The woman nodded understandingly and hurried outside to intercept Audrey.

"Miss Winslow?" The associate greeted with practiced warmth. "Are you looking for someone?"

Audrey paused, giving her a questioning look. "Do you know him?"

The associate flashed a saccharine smile. "Naturally. I work at Sterling & Co. I've seen you and Mr. Sinclair together before." She lowered her voice conspiratorially. "He's inside right now. I noticed you seemed... concerned."

Audrey's instincts screamed warning, but the associate's words were dripping with honeyed politeness. Surely an employee of such a prestigious brand wouldn't lie about this?

"Thank you," Audrey replied coolly. "I'll go find him myself."

The associate hesitated dramatically. "Miss Winslow..."

Audrey's eyebrow arched. "Yes?"

Leaning in, the associate whispered, "There's... a woman inside who's been rather... attached to Mr. Sinclair. We couldn't exactly intervene..."

Audrey's expression darkened. She'd read those tabloid stories about shop girls seducing wealthy clients. Was this happening right under her nose?

Her thoughts spiraled. Dominic had excused himself to the restroom earlier—was this why he'd disappeared? They'd barely started dating and he was already straying?

White-hot anger obliterated all reason as she stormed toward the Sterling & Co counter. The moment Audrey entered, she spotted Dominic with his back turned, standing dangerously close to a woman in a sales associate uniform.

Not just one woman, but two? Her vision blurred with rage. Without thinking, she marched forward and delivered a stinging slap across the associate's face.

The sharp crack of the slap silenced the entire boutique. Every head turned in shock. Audrey stood trembling with fury, hands planted on her hips as she unleashed her wrath.

"You shameless hussy! Trying to steal my man? And you!" She whirled on Dominic. "You worthless playboy! You have me and you're still sniffing around this... this shop girl? Have you lost your damn mind?"

Dominic turned slowly, genuine confusion knitting his brows together. "Audrey? What the hell are you doing here?"
###Chapter 392

Vivian straightened at the counter, her emerald eyes flashing with sudden interest. "Audrey?"

The slapped salesgirl clutched her burning cheek, shock and pain warring across her face. She threw a desperate look at her colleague who'd brought Audrey in - now frozen by the entrance like a deer in headlights.

"What in the world just happened?" the other associate breathed, completely unprepared for the storm she'd unwittingly summoned.

The assistant by the door hesitated, confusion and alarm flickering across her features before scurrying to Audrey's side. "Miss Winslow, there must be some mistake—"

Before she could imply Vivian was the troublemaker, Audrey's gaze had already landed on her friend. After shooting Dominic a glacial look, she marched toward Vivian. When she reached her, her voice warmed instantly. "Darling Vivian! Fancy seeing you here of all places!"

The sales staff turned to statues. Even the slapped one bit her tongue, suddenly terrified. If Vivian moved in Audrey's circles, she was either a hidden powerhouse or dangerously well-connected. Not someone to mess with.

The humiliated assistant, cheek still throbbing, tried to shrink into the background. Meanwhile Dominic, oblivious to the undercurrents, mistook Audrey's fury for mere dramatics. He stepped forward with placating hands.

"Sweetheart, didn't you say to meet by the theater?"

"Meet you? With the movie halfway through?" She scoffed without glancing his way. "Or were you too... preoccupied here with some distraction?"

Dominic looked genuinely wounded by the accusation. "Love, you've got it all wrong! I was just helping Vivian—she was being harassed. Tell her, Viv!"

He turned pleading eyes to Vivian, who nodded confirmation. "He's actually telling the truth this time."

Audrey's expression softened instantly. "Someone was bothering you?"

Vivian's frosty gaze slid to the red-cheeked salesgirl. "Apparently I'm not worthy to look at a pen."

Audrey's hands flew to her hips. "I see I was too gentle earlier. Had I known you were insulting my friend, I'd have struck you twice as hard!"

Dominic gaped. Vivian rated higher than him? His flirting only deserved one slap?

Realizing he was nearly collateral damage, Dominic snapped at the nearest uninvolved clerk. "Get your manager. Now."

The slapped salesgirl suddenly remembered she had Serena's number. Frantically, she fumbled for her phone.

Just as the call connected, Adrian strode in like an avenging angel, the usually cocky store manager scrambling behind him. "I was transferring inventory—had no idea about this mess! Mrs. Blackwood will receive our deepest apologies."

The salesgirl's hopeful expression at Adrian's entrance made her forget the active call. Her only thought: use Serena as a shield.
###Chapter 393

The salesgirl rushed to explain to Adrian, "Mr. Blackwood, your girlfriend said you preferred this pen, so our manager specially reserved it for you. But then this lady insisted on taking it. Thank goodness you're here - we lowly employees wouldn't know how to handle this situation."

As she spewed her excuses, the store manager's face darkened. She pulled the salesgirl aside and whispered sharply, "Shut your mouth. I'll deal with you later, don't make this worse."

Before the salesgirl could mention Serena to the manager, Adrian moved to Vivian's side, wrapping a protective arm around her shoulders. His voice was icy. "Are you suggesting my wife doesn't have the right to look at your pens? Exactly who do you think you're selling to here in Crestwood?"

His cutting words were directed at the salesgirl, though he didn't even glance her way.

The salesgirl turned deathly pale, gaping at Vivian. "W-wife?" she stammered.

The realization hit her like a truck - she'd just insulted the very person she should have been courting. Remembering how she'd sneered at Vivian earlier, she wished the floor would open up and swallow her. She was the one completely delusional!

Audrey, understanding exactly who the "girlfriend" must be, said pointedly, "Mr. Blackwood is married to one woman only! You've mistaken some scheming opportunist for his actual partner. You're backing the wrong horse here."

The manager quickly stepped in, pulling the salesgirl away. "Our deepest apologies, Mrs. Blackwood. She's new and didn't recognize you—"

Vivian's gaze turned frosty as she lifted her eyes to meet the manager's. "Are you saying it would have been acceptable for her to treat me poorly if I weren't Mrs. Blackwood?" Caught off guard, the manager fumbled before forcing a contrite smile. "I apologize for the miscommunication. We strive to treat all clients equally regardless of status. Clearly I haven't trained her properly, and for that, I'm truly sorry." She nudged the salesgirl. "Apologize to Mrs. Blackwood. Now."

The salesgirl muttered an apology, though her reluctance was palpable. Humiliation burned through her, fueling her resentment toward Vivian. How did some nobody manage to marry someone as distinguished as Adrian Blackwood? Her mind raced with theories about Vivian's supposed manipulations, only deepening her disdain.

Dominic, losing patience, stepped forward. "Just fire her already. This is a waste of time."

Forgetting their earlier disagreement, Audrey moved to Dominic's side, linking arms with him. "Absolutely! What's the point of an apology now?"
###Chapter 394

The sales associate couldn't hold back her frustration. "Why?" she demanded.

The store manager hesitated, stuttering, "Fire her? I-I don't have that authority."

Truth was, the associate was family. Letting her go would cause unnecessary drama at home, especially with her mother-in-law's inevitable interference.

"You don't?" Adrian Blackwood's voice cut through the tension as he strode in, flanked by a distinguished middle-aged man.

Dressed in an immaculate charcoal suit, the newcomer carried himself with the confidence of wealth and power. He approached Adrian respectfully, extending a business card. "Mr. Blackwood, I'm the CEO of Sterling & Co, overseeing operations here."

"Terminate her employment," Adrian interrupted sharply, gesturing toward the offending saleswoman.

The CEO turned to the associate. "You've violated our customer service standards. Report to HR immediately to process your termination."

The woman shot a pleading look at her manager, who deliberately looked away. Having never encountered corporate leadership in her three years there, the associate now wished the ground would swallow her whole.

As she opened her mouth to protest, two broad-shouldered security guards materialized. "Let's make this civil, miss," one warned, making it clear they'd remove her physically if necessary.

Defeated, she allowed herself to be escorted out.

Audrey Winslow whirled on Adrian. "See what you've caused!"

"Enough, Audrey," Dominic Sinclair tried to intervene, placing a hand on her arm.

She shook him off. "No! He's the reason Vivian endures this humiliation. Keeping their marriage secret means no one recognizes her as Mrs. Blackwood."

"And when he's not around to witness it?" Dominic swallowed hard.

No one but Vivian would dare speak to Adrian this way. Yet here stood Audrey, with no marital protection - Adrian's reaction remained unpredictable.

Adrian paused, anger flashing across his features before he conceded, "You're right. Vivian and I will have a proper wedding."

Across town, Serena Whitmore's fingers went slack. Her phone clattered to the floor, abruptly ending the call.

"Wait!" Audrey's commanding voice froze everyone in their tracks.

Security guards and remaining staff turned in unison, confusion written across their faces.

Audrey's manicured finger pointed unerringly to a shadowy corner. "And her!"

Cowering behind a display stood the other sales associate - the one who'd fed Audrey misinformation earlier. She looked ready to melt into the wallpaper.

###Chapter 395

Audrey's voice turned razor-sharp as she pressed on. "These two have been conspiring together. That one even attempted to fabricate rumors, painting Vivian as Dominic's lover to stir up drama."

Adrian's gaze slid slowly toward Dominic, his calm stare carrying glacial intensity. Dominic felt an arctic chill slither down his spine.

He threw up his hands in frantic defense, words tumbling out unevenly. "Adrian, this is absurd! I have zero connection to her. My dealings with Vivian are completely professional. I only intervened because she was being mistreated!"

Adrian's expression remained unreadable, his voice steady with faint derision. "I'm aware."

Dominic exhaled in relief, even mustering a cocky grin. "I knew you'd recognize this nonsense. You know exactly what kind of man I—"

"She wouldn't look twice at you," Adrian cut in smoothly.

Dominic's words died in his throat. His face darkened as he glanced around, certain the others were stifling laughter at his expense.

Attempting to salvage his dignity, he muttered, "Adrian, really? In front of everyone? A little courtesy wouldn't kill you."

Audrey seized the moment, looping her arm possessively around Dominic's neck and twisting the knife. "You're truly delusional, aren't you? Adrian's merely stating facts. Choosing you was already an act of charity on my part. The bare minimum you could do is start acting like a proper gentleman."

Meanwhile, the sales associate cowering in the corner—who thought she'd dodged the worst—suddenly found herself exposed. Panicking, she rushed forward, pointing a shaking finger at her colleague being escorted out. "I swear it wasn't me! She masterminded this entire scheme! Mrs. Blackwood, you must believe me—I even warned her not to judge customers by appearances!"

Hearing this, the other associate whirled around mid-exit, spitting venom. "Oh shut your trap, you viper! You've been gunning for my position since day one! Let's review the security footage—show Mr. Blackwood your true colors!"

The boutique erupted as the women descended into a screeching match, their spat escalating into a full-blown spectacle. Both Vivian and Audrey instinctively retreated, as if avoiding shrapnel. The CEO's expression darkened like thunderclouds, his patience shattering. "Remove them immediately!" he barked at security. "Haven't we endured enough humiliation today?"

Within seconds, the guards hauled the shrieking women away. As blessed silence returned, the CEO turned to Vivian. "Mrs. Blackwood, please allow us to make reparations. Purchase any single item, and we'll include a complimentary gift valued up to one hundred thousand sterling."

The CEO had already connected the dots.

He knew Vivian's attention had been drawn to the store's crown jewel—an exquisite limited-edition pen rumored to have also caught Adrian's eye. Offering a hundred-thousand-sterling gift was negligible compared to salvaging this disaster.

Naturally, Vivian wasn't about to refuse such generosity. With a polished smile, she approached the display case. Her gaze landed on an ivory fountain pen with clean, understated lines. Unlike its bedazzled counterparts, it exuded quiet sophistication. She checked the price—thirty thousand sterling.

Perfect for Julian. A thirty-thousand-sterling pen, plus a hundred-thousand-sterling bonus. The irony amused her—today's humiliation had transformed into effortless profit. This windfall surpassed weeks of grueling work.
###Chapter 396

The weight of the fountain pen felt all wrong in Adrian's grasp. "This doesn't suit me," he murmured, his voice laced with quiet disdain.

Vivian didn't even glance up from examining another pen. "It's not meant for you," she said bluntly. "It's perfect for him."

The temperature in the boutique seemed to plummet. Adrian's eyes turned glacial as he demanded, "Who is 'him'?"

"Julian," Vivian answered distractedly, rotating a silver-plated pen between her fingers. "He saved me during that boating accident. Giving him a gift just for that would feel too calculated. But his birthday's approaching, so I thought I'd pick something while we're here."

Adrian's expression darkened immediately. A sardonic smile twisted his lips. "His birthday? You remember that?"

Still focused on the pens, Vivian shrugged. "We haven't spoken in years. How would I remember?" she said absently.

The sudden light in Adrian's eyes was unmistakable. Nearby, Audrey nudged Dominic, whispering behind her hand, "Does Adrian enjoy being treated like this? When Vivian used to dote on him, he couldn't care less. Now that she's indifferent, he's practically wagging his tail—look how he's perking up at one casual remark."

Dominic, lost in thought, muttered, "Speaking of which, Julian's actually some distant cousin of Vivian's—"

He froze mid-sentence, realizing his mistake. Grabbing Audrey's elbow, he hastily retreated toward the exit. "Adrian, Vivian, we've got that movie to finish. We'll leave you to your shopping!"

Audrey blinked in confusion but allowed herself to be dragged away.

Vivian stood frozen, Dominic's words echoing in her mind. "Distant cousin?" Since when did the Dawsons have any notable distant relatives? Then realization struck.

Dominic wouldn't know about Dawson family history—but he would know the Blackwood lineage. Which meant Julian wasn't her relative—he was Adrian's.

Everything clicked into place. It explained Julian's access to the Blackwood yacht and their private conversation at Crystalpeak. But why hadn't Adrian formally introduced them?

Shaking off the thought, Vivian turned to more pressing matters. "Since you're related," she said to Adrian, "you must know his tastes. Would he prefer this pen? Or does he have other hobbies? I want to choose something he'll genuinely like."

She held up an onyx fountain pen, examining it under the boutique lights.

Adrian's expression darkened further. "We're not close," he said tersely. "Haven't spoken in years. He's some distant cousin—I've got hundreds of relatives. How would I know their preferences?"

"Fair point." Vivian nodded, setting down the black pen. She picked up the silver one she'd been considering earlier and handed it to the shopkeeper. "We'll take this one."
###Chapter 397

The CEO motioned to the remaining junior sales assistant. "Package this for Mrs. Hartley."

Assuming the $30,000 ivory fountain pen was the complimentary gift, the CEO flashed an obsequious smile. "Shall we wrap the other one as well?"

Vivian hesitated, thinking he referred to the Sterling pen. She picked it up again and glanced at Adrian. "This one suits you perfectly."

Adrian's gaze flickered to the price tag - $90,000, triple the ivory pen's cost.

His lips twisted in feigned disinterest. "Hardly remarkable. I've never bothered with anything this pedestrian."

Vivian arched one perfectly sculpted brow, suppressing amusement. Without comment, she handed the Sterling pen to the CEO. "Consider this your gift to us."

The CEO's practiced smile faltered. "Our... gift?" he asked cautiously, his professional composure cracking. Surely she couldn't mean...

Vivian nodded serenely, her tone laced with playful steel. "Naturally. Thirty thousand is already extravagant. Asking for a hundred-thousand-dollar gift would be downright vulgar."

The CEO gaped, momentarily speechless. In his decades of dealing with entitled clientele, this audacity was unprecedented. As a ruthless businessman, he prided himself on his cutthroat instincts, but this woman operated on another level entirely.

Desperate, the CEO turned to Adrian. "Mr. Blackwood, we secured that sapphire-limited edition you admired. Would you care to see it?"

Before Adrian could respond, Vivian smoothly interjected, "Which of your little admirers pulled strings for that?"

The CEO blanched, realizing his tactical error.

Adrian's expression remained impassive. "I own an identical piece," he said dismissively. "Half the social circuit has seen it."

Vivian seized the opening, her smile turning razor-sharp. "Since he already has one, we'll return for newer models." The unspoken message hung between them - and we won't be spending another dime here.

The CEO's ingratiating tactics had spectacularly backfired. The sales assistant's earlier rudeness, combined with the store's blatant greed, had irrevocably soured Vivian. Such predatory behavior didn't deserve her patronage.

Adrian, his patience evaporating, gestured impatiently. "Just finish the packaging."

Thoroughly defeated, the CEO instructed the assistant to hastily wrap the pens. When presented with the purchases, Vivian took both bags and offered one to Adrian.

Adrian quirked an eyebrow, his lips twitching. "Regifting freebies? How... economical of you."

Stepping onto the sunlit plaza, Vivian cast one final glance at the CEO's thunderous expression before turning to Adrian. Her teasing smile danced at the corners of her mouth. "Who said this was for you?"

Adrian's eyebrow climbed higher. "Then who exactly merits this generosity?"
###Chapter 398

Vivian shot him an exasperated look. "Do I look like a walking bank vault? Sure, this pen was complimentary, but it's actually worth more than the one I bought! Who on earth would I give such an extravagant gift to? I need it for drafting my manuscripts. I just asked you to hold it for a second."

Adrian's expression darkened. "But you said it suited me."

Vivian let out an impatient sigh. "Why must you twist everything? First you claim you wouldn't be caught dead with such a 'cheap' pen, now you're sulking because I'm not giving it to you?"

"I never said I wouldn't use an affordable pen," Adrian countered, his voice dripping with mock offense. "Merely that I've never used one this modest before. As a wordsmith, shouldn't you appreciate semantic precision?"

Before he could finish, Vivian had already brushed past him, her heels clicking decisively against the marble floor. Adrian hesitated, watching the distance between them grow, before jogging to catch up with an exaggerated sigh.

As they walked, Vivian's attention was drawn to a newly opened boutique. She browsed the displays with mild interest until, just as she turned to leave, a sleek leather glasses case caught her eye.

Remembering the battered case she'd seen Ethan using earlier, she picked it up and headed to the register. Her eyebrows shot up when she saw the price tag - five hundred dollars for such a small item.

Before she could reconsider, the cashier had already printed the receipt. "Cash, card, or mobile payment?" the clerk chirped.

Choosing mobile payment with resigned acceptance, Vivian pulled out her phone.

As the transaction processed, the clerk cheerfully tossed a hideous neon green frog plush into her bag. "Today's promotion - spend five hundred and get this stress-relief toy free!"

Vivian forced a tight-lipped smile. "How... thoughtful." Stepping outside, she found Adrian leaning against a pillar, drawing admiring glances from a group of women. Their hopeful expressions fell when they saw Vivian approach, one muttering, "Figures. The gorgeous ones are always taken."

Adrian smirked at their retreating backs, shooting Vivian a pointed look. "Seems I'm quite the desirable commodity, according to public opinion."

Vivian didn't miss a beat. "Remember that celebrity heartthrob whose scandal made headlines last year? His wife was envied too... before the truth came out."

"And when have I ever resembled that trainwreck?" Adrian protested, his eyes widening in mock horror as he followed her.

Pausing mid-step, Vivian tapped her chin thoughtfully. "Neglect can be just as damaging as outright betrayal. You've had your moments." She continued walking as she added, "But everyone has flaws. Work on yours, and who knows? You might actually deserve that admiration."

Adrian scoffed. "Sure, I can definitely improve." The words had barely left his mouth when he realized he'd been maneuvered into making an implicit promise. He was still processing this when Vivian stepped into the waiting elevator. He barely managed to slip in before the doors closed.

In the dim underground parking garage, Vivian immediately pulled out the garish frog toy before handing Ethan a sleek shopping bag. "I noticed your glasses case was falling apart earlier. Saw this while shopping and thought of you."

Ethan's surprise was palpable as he accepted the gift with tentative fingers. "Mrs. Blackwood, I..."
###Chapter 399

"Mrs. Blackwood, this is too much," Ethan said hesitantly, holding the designer bag with trembling fingers.

Vivian waved off his concern with a careless flick of her wrist. "It's nothing special, just a little something I picked up." Though she spoke lightly, the five-hundred-sterling price tag had made her wince. She wouldn't spend that much on herself.

Adrian slid into the car just as their exchange concluded, his stormy expression darkening further. Feeling excluded, he interjected sharply, "You actually went shopping for him?"

Ethan froze, the bag hovering awkwardly between them as he debated whether to accept or return it. Vivian cut through the tension. "Keep it, Ethan. It was an impulse buy."

Her mood lifted as she turned to Adrian with a mischievous glint. "Though I did find something special for you."

Ethan exhaled in relief, placing the bag carefully beside him. "Thank you, Mrs. Blackwood."

Adrian feigned indifference. "And why would you get me anything?"

Vivian presented him with the hideous frog plush. "This reminded me of you."

Adrian took the grotesque toy, his disbelief growing as he squeezed its misshapen face. "This is supposed to represent me?"

Her eyes sparkled with amusement. "Consider it a stress reliever. With how tightly wound you are, I thought it appropriate."

Just as Adrian began to soften at her playful reasoning, he spotted the dangling tag proclaiming "Free Gift." He dangled it accusingly. "This was a giveaway?"

Internally cursing the store's obvious promotion, Vivian maintained her composure. "You seemed quite taken with the free pen earlier. I assumed you'd appreciate this one too."

Disgusted, Adrian tossed the frog onto the car floor and addressed Ethan icily. "Am I sleeping in the garage tonight?"

"My apologies, Mr. Blackwood," Ethan muttered, resigned to being the scapegoat.

As they pulled away, Adrian commanded crisply, "Take us to Seabreeze Villa."

Vivian glared at the discarded frog. Even if he disliked it, the gift deserved better treatment. Memories surfaced of the small trinkets they'd collected from diners years ago - insignificant tokens she'd treasured because Adrian had casually handed them to her.

With these thoughts swirling, she retrieved the frog, rolled down the window, and declared, "If you don't want it, don't leave it here. Throw it away properly."

Just as she prepared to toss it, Adrian snatched it from her grasp. Startled, she watched as his fingers closed around the plush, squeezing its distorted features until it bore an uncanny resemblance to his own scowling face. The absurd similarity nearly made her laugh.

Suppressing her amusement, she asked pointedly, "I thought you didn't want it?"

Adrian stuffed the frog into his suit pocket by the door, his expression unreadable. "Once given, a gift can't be taken back."

The ridiculousness of the situation dissolved her irritation. She poked the frog's squished face playfully. "It does look like you, doesn't it?"
###Chapter 400

Adrian cradled the frog gently before leaning in to press a kiss against Vivian's flushed cheek. "Guess that makes you my little frog now."

Vivian wrinkled her nose in playful disgust, shoving the amphibian away. "Me? Even as a frog, I'd be the fairest in the land. The crown princess of lily pads."

With mischievous fingers, Adrian began molding the frog like clay. "Then I'll be your devoted prince."

Vivian's laughter caught in her throat, startled by the unexpected playfulness from her usually stoic husband. She gave his shoulder a light punch, giggles bubbling up. "That was terrible. I think I just got frostbite from how cheesy that was."

He watched the way her eyes crinkled at the corners, how sunlight danced across her smiling lips. Something warm and unfamiliar expanded in his chest. These moments - these careless, joyful moments - were worth every compromise.

For the first time, he thought he might be beginning to understand the true meaning of marriage.

Meanwhile, at Seabreeze Villa...

Beyond the freshly manicured hedges, a shadowy figure approached Gwendolyn, thrusting several paper bags into her arms. "Dispose of the old ones properly. Don't mix them up."

Inside lay identical replicas of Vivian's daily supplements.

"Understood," Gwendolyn muttered before scurrying back toward the villa like a startled mouse.

In the privacy of her quarters, she meticulously transferred the new supplements into Vivian's bottles. As she stuffed the originals into a plastic bag, hesitation gripped her. These were the supplements Madame Blackwood had procured at great expense - surely they held some value.

Her fingers flew across her phone screen as she texted her son: "Come to Seabreeze Villa immediately. I have special supplements for your girlfriend. Maybe these will finally give me a healthy grandson."

A second message followed for emphasis: "Call upon arrival. Do NOT enter. Wait by the main road."

Thirty minutes later...

Ethan turned the car into the gated community when Vivian suddenly stiffened. Through the window, she spotted Gwendolyn sneaking toward the gates, clutching a suspicious plastic bag.

"Stop the car," Vivian commanded, tapping Ethan's shoulder sharply.

Though confused, Ethan knew better than to question Mrs. Blackwood's orders. The brakes hissed as the luxury vehicle came to an abrupt halt.

Vivian rolled down her window. "Gwendolyn! Where exactly are you going?"

The housekeeper froze like a deer in headlights, the bag twitching behind her back. "M-Mrs. Blackwood! You're home early..."

Vivian's gaze sharpened. "I asked where you're going."

"Just... taking out the trash," Gwendolyn stammered, fingers tightening around the bag.

Vivian's eyebrow arched. Since when did the villa staff handle their own trash disposal? Something wasn't adding up.

The plastic bag crinkled ominously in Gwendolyn's trembling hands.
###Chapter 401

The tension in the air was palpable as Vivian Hartley exited the vehicle without another word. Her manicured fingers curled around the door handle with deliberate precision. "Hand it over," she demanded, her voice cutting through the silence like a blade.

Gwendolyn Pierce's eyes darted nervously, her retreating steps betraying her guilt. "Mrs. Hartley, it's just some expired seafood. Really not worth your attention."

Adrian Blackwood emerged soundlessly from the car, his towering frame casting a shadow over the scene. His presence alone made the atmosphere suffocating.

Vivian's lips pressed into a thin line. "The Blackwood estate has never served substandard ingredients. Leave the bag here. I'll have our supplier explain this disgrace personally."

Gwendolyn's shoulders hunched defensively. "It wasn't from your kitchen. I... I bought it myself. It was cheaper." She attempted to sidestep them, but Ethan Caldwell moved with panther-like grace, blocking her escape route.

Ethan's voice turned razor sharp. "You were explicitly told during orientation - no outside food without authorization. Every ingredient in this house is specially sourced."

In one fluid motion, he seized the plastic bag from her trembling hands. His expert fingers examined the contents before passing it to Vivian and Adrian. "Not seafood," he announced. "Health supplements."

Vivian's brow furrowed as she recognized the packaging. She glanced at Adrian. "Isn't this your mother's special formulation?"

Adrian's gaze turned glacial as it locked onto Gwendolyn. "Start talking."

When the housekeeper remained silent, Ethan delivered the final blow. "If you prefer, we can involve the authorities. Do you know the market value of these supplements? Enough for felony charges."

The color drained from Gwendolyn's face.

She collapsed to the pavement, her performance beginning. "Please, Mrs. Hartley!" Fake tears streaked her cheeks. "My son just got engaged! I only wanted to help his fiancée's health. There was so much... I thought no one would miss a little."

Vivian's expression hardened. "After all these years working here, you resort to theft? I've always allowed staff to take leftovers. Why steal what you could have asked for?"

Gwendolyn's wails grew louder, though her eyes remained dry. "I was weak! I couldn't resist!"

Vivian made a sharp cutting motion with her hand. "Enough. This ends now." She turned to Ethan. "Calculate her severance and arrange transport. She leaves Seabreeze Villa immediately."

Gwendolyn's desperate gaze flew to Adrian. "Mr. Blackwood! I've served your family for decades! I'll forfeit my entire month's salary to repay this!"

The housekeeper position at the Blackwood estate paid better than most corporate jobs, with benefits most servants could only dream of. More importantly, it had been her steady source of income to cover her son's gambling debts and their extravagant lifestyle. Losing this position meant financial ruin.

Her mind raced for another angle, another performance that might save her. But the cold finality in Vivian's eyes told her the show was over.
###Chapter 402

Adrian didn't even glance in her direction. "Household matters are entirely Mrs. Blackwood's domain."

Trembling with fear and out of alternatives, Gwendolyn collapsed to her knees. "Mrs. Blackwood, I swear on my life I'll never repeat this mistake. Please show mercy. My entire family depends on this job."

All pretense of dignity abandoned, she pressed her forehead against the marble floor with a sickening thud, the sound reverberating through the grand foyer of Seabreeze Villa.

Vivian took a deliberate step back, her frosty gaze unwavering. "No one will learn you were fired for misconduct. I'll simply say we're restructuring staff. But if you persist with this emotional blackmail..." Her voice turned glacial. "I'll ensure every household in Crestwood knows about your criminal record. Let's see who'd hire you then."

Gwendolyn's spine snapped straight as if electrified. The blood trickling from her scraped forehead painted a pathetic picture, but Vivian's steel tone extinguished any hope of sympathy.

Ethan moved forward from his position by the staircase. "Gather your belongings. I'll escort you out," he stated with finality.

Head bowed, Gwendolyn trailed Ethan back through the villa's opulent halls. When they reached her quarters, her gaze lingered on a discreet stash of supplements hidden near the bed. Sensing Ethan's watchful presence at the door, her fingers twitched before curling into fists. With practiced subtlety, she kicked the bottles beneath the bedframe before resuming packing.

Taking them now would be suicidal if caught. Better to leave them for Serena to handle later.

Her meager possessions took mere minutes to collect. Soon she was trudging down the villa's driveway, suitcase in hand. Passing Vivian, she shot her a look so venomous it could curdle milk. The hatred in those eyes burned like acid.

Vivian suddenly sneezed. "Someone's definitely cursing me," she remarked, rubbing her nose.

Adrian draped his cashmere coat over her shoulders, pulling her close. "Superstitions are beneath you. It's just the evening chill." He kissed her temple. "Come inside before you catch cold."

She melted into his embrace, savoring his warmth. "I'm not cooking tonight. Let's order that new Sichuan hotpot place."

Adrian hesitated, recalling their nutritionist's latest lecture. But the eager sparkle in Vivian's hazel eyes dismantled his resistance. "Fine," he conceded with a resigned smile.

"It's just broth and vegetables," Vivian coaxed, already pulling up the restaurant's menu on her phone. "Not exactly arsenic."

Upstairs, Vivian changed into silk lounge pants and a cashmere camisole before padding barefoot to the living room. She sprawled across the sectional, scrolling delivery estimates while Adrian adjusted the thermostat with a quiet click.

Noticing him watching, she hugged a throw pillow. "Dining room's too formal. Let's eat here with a movie." She bit her lip playfully. "Audrey and I did this last week. I'll clean everything afterward—no mess, I promise."

Adrian settled beside her, fingers threading through her honey-blonde hair. "Darling, we employ people for that." His thumb traced her jawline. "Save your energy for things that truly matter."

The unspoken meaning hung between them—their time together was precious, not to be wasted on trivialities. Vivian's answering smile held all the warmth of the imaginary hotpot bubbling toward them through the winter night.
###Chapter 403

Vivian's smile faltered. She straightened her posture, turning to face him fully. "So during those two years when I was just a homemaker... that's how you saw it? That none of it mattered?"

Adrian hesitated, his stormy gray eyes locking with hers. "In certain aspects, yes," he confessed, measuring each word.

A soft exhale escaped Vivian's lips, her expression more contemplative than upset. "It wasn't all drudgery, you know. At the time, I genuinely believed keeping our home perfect and cooking for the man I loved had meaning. But—"

She paused deliberately, weighing her next words. "When you invest too much of yourself in another person, pieces of your own identity start slipping away. Everyone needs their own space, their own sense of self."

Adrian's features softened as he nodded in understanding.

Vivian reached for his hand, her delicate fingers enveloping his larger ones. She held his gaze, her voice steady yet warm. "From now on, just say what you're thinking, alright? Don't make me play guessing games. Open communication is the foundation of any relationship."

Adrian studied her for a prolonged moment before his lips curved into that rare, genuine smile. "Deal," he murmured. Leaning in, he gently brushed aside her chestnut bangs before pressing a whisper-soft kiss to her forehead.

Time seemed to accelerate, and before they knew it, filming for "Ambermyst" was drawing to a close. Vivian's personal life flourished alongside her thriving career.

The internet buzzed with constant updates, and thanks to the Blackwood Group's meticulous reputation management, negative press about Vivian had virtually disappeared. Those who'd previously encountered the gossip now wondered if they'd imagined the whole scandal.

"Spotlight Night," the variety show postponed due to Vivian's earlier controversy, had finally been rescheduled. The lengthy delay meant much of the content had already leaked, including the revelation that Serena Whitmore would be appearing on the same episode.

Though Adrian had been personally driving Vivian to set every day, today's schedule coincided with an important board meeting, leaving Audrey to take over chauffeur duties.

As Audrey pulled up in her candy-apple red Maserati—a lavish gift from Dominic—Vivian casually mentioned sharing the stage with Serena. Audrey nearly slammed the brakes in shock.

"Wait, seriously? They're pairing you two together? That's practically begging for drama!"

Vivian remained composed, her fingers tracing patterns on the car window. "The producers would love nothing more than awkward tension between us. Controversy drives ratings."

Audrey smacked the steering wheel in frustration. "This is beyond tasteless. They're exploiting personal history for cheap thrills."

Her outburst faded as she absently stroked the leather-wrapped wheel, the extravagant present from Dominic stirring mixed emotions. Their unlikely romance—between a free-spirited stylist and a corporate heir—only grew stronger with each passing month.

Returning to the present, Vivian offered, "It's probably just scheduling. Both 'Blazing Horizon' and 'Ambermyst' have similar release timelines. They're just maximizing publicity opportunities."
###Chapter 404

Vivian tilted her head curiously. "So, are you really going through with it?"

With a careless shrug, Audrey responded, "I promised Mr. Vaughn. Too many people have invested in me to back out now. The entertainment industry is a small world - if I keep avoiding her, I might as well quit this business altogether."

Vivian nodded in understanding. "Exactly. She's the one who should be nervous, not you."

She fastened her seatbelt with a mischievous grin. "Let me treat you, Viv! How about we find you a show-stopping outfit that'll make you the center of attention on that program?"

Vivian waved off the suggestion. "I just wanted a quiet dinner with you. No need for shopping sprees. Adrian already sent over two racks of designer pieces from his boutique. I'll pick something from those."

Audrey clicked her tongue playfully. "Oh please, you're radiating that newlywed glow again - can't go five minutes without mentioning Adrian."

Vivian countered calmly but with an edge, "I'm simply stating facts. Though I suppose when you're in love, everyone else seems lovesick too."

Audrey threw up her hands in mock surrender. "Alright, truce! Let's not argue about who's more smitten."

Vivian's lips curved into a smirk. "Because we both know it's you."

Audrey broke into a bright smile, conceding defeat. "Fine, you win this round."

She couldn't help but notice how delightfully childish Vivian had become since reconciling with Adrian.

Their drive to Opal Galleria was filled with easy laughter and light conversation. The mall buzzed with energy as dinner hour approached, crowds thickening around them.

Suddenly, a figure came rushing toward them. With a dramatic thud, someone dropped to their knees before Vivian. A murmuring crowd quickly gathered, whispering, "What's going on here?"

Vivian instinctively stepped back, squinting at the kneeling figure. Recognition dawned - it was Gwendolyn, whom she hadn't seen in months.

Adrian flipped through the proposal with a razor-sharp gaze. His voice cut through the room like ice. "Do you honestly believe I stayed late to review this amateurish draft?"

Without hesitation, he flicked the folder from his hand, sending papers scattering across the floor like autumn leaves in a storm.

The executive, confident moments before, now had sweat beading on his forehead as panic set in. Falling to his knees, he scrambled to collect the documents. "Mr. Blackwood, I'll revise it immediately and have it back on your desk by morning," he stammered, desperation creeping into his voice.

Adrian's expression darkened further. The executive, uncertain what had worsened the situation, clutched the disorganized folder to his chest and made a hasty exit.

As he opened the door, he nearly collided with Ethan who was entering. The executive's eyes lit up with desperate hope. Closing the door behind him, he pulled Ethan aside like a drowning man grasping at straws. "Ethan, has Mr. Blackwood been having marital problems recently?"
###Chapter 405

The office buzzed with hushed conversations about Adrian Blackwood's sudden return to his icy demeanor. After weeks of appearing almost approachable since his marriage to Vivian Hartley, the temperature in the office had dropped below freezing again. Whispers about marital troubles spread like wildfire through the cubicles.

Ethan Caldwell's voice cut through the tension like warm honey. "Just make sure dinner isn't delayed for Mr. and Mrs. Blackwood."

"Trust me, their marriage is perfectly fine."

The eavesdropping employees caught this exchange like hungry sharks scenting blood. A collective realization dawned, followed by overly enthusiastic responses. "Thanks for the heads up, Ethan! Do remind Mr. Blackwood to leave early and spend time with his wife. We'll email the revisions directly to you. Maybe you could review them for us? Tomorrow's coffee is our treat!"

They scattered like frightened rabbits, desperate to escape the Arctic chill surrounding their boss's office.

Ethan shook his head with an amused smirk. Pushing open the conference room door, he found Adrian alone, glancing up from his phone with knowing eyes. "They're gone?"

"Cleared out," Ethan confirmed, gathering abandoned documents. "So, dinner plans with Vivian tonight?"

Adrian's voice remained deceptively calm, like the eye of a hurricane. "She's dining with a friend."

Ethan's eyes twinkled with mischief. "Why not surprise her and pick her up?"

Adrian didn't protest, checking his phone again where Vivian's message glowed. The Opal Galleria wasn't far from the office.

Meanwhile at the mall, Gwendolyn Pierce dramatically collapsed to her knees before Vivian, her voice quivering with theatrical despair. "Mrs. Blackwood! I've slaved away caring for you! My whole family depends on me, and this is how you repay me? Firing me without reason? You wealthy people think we're beneath your notice!"

Audrey Winslow froze momentarily, her mind racing to process the scene.

Recovering quickly, Audrey stepped protectively in front of Vivian. "Enough with the theatrics. You've been paid. It's not our fault if—"

Gwendolyn cut her off, her voice ringing through the mall like a fire alarm. "This so-called celebrity treats people like dirt! She exploits the working class!"

Curious shoppers began forming a circle, their murmurs growing louder. Vivian, fresh from filming and still wearing sunglasses and a face mask, felt their gazes sharpen with recognition. The crowd buzzed with speculation about her identity.

Seizing the moment, Gwendolyn switched tactics, dramatically sinking to the floor as if crushed by injustice. "Payment? What payment? I haven't seen a single cent! The richer they are, the colder their hearts!"

Audrey and Vivian exchanged uneasy glances. Leaning close, Audrey whispered, "Was her salary actually paid?"

Vivian gave a slight shake of her head. Gwendolyn's wages were handled by Ethan, so Vivian wasn't entirely sure. After a brief hesitation, Vivian addressed the gathering crowd with steady authority. "If there's a payment dispute, you're welcome to contact human resources or file a formal complaint. But making false accusations in public could result in defamation charges."

She nearly mentioned Ethan's name but stopped herself. In the age of social media storms, one careless word could ignite an uncontrollable wildfire.
###Chapter 406

Adrian barely crossed the threshold of Opal Galleria when the murmurs of an assembling crowd pricked his ears. Among the indistinct chatter, certain voices stood out, teasing at the corners of his memory. He turned to Ethan with a silent command in his gaze.

"Mr. Blackwood, I'll investigate the commotion," Ethan said promptly before disappearing into the sea of people.

Adrian remained motionless, his sharp eyes surveying the scene when a vision in white suddenly appeared before him. "Adrian, what a coincidence seeing you here."

His body reacted before his mind, taking an instinctive step back. The woman wore a white athleisure set, her features hidden beneath a baseball cap, surgical mask, and oversized sunglasses. Yet even through these barriers, recognition struck him instantly.

"Serena," he acknowledged stiffly, gesturing toward the gathering crowd. "Here for lunch?"

Her laugh carried a bitter undertone. "Adrian, when did we become such strangers?"

His voice softened in an attempt to diffuse the tension. "You're imagining things again, Serena. Your cardiologist warned against unnecessary stress."

Always her heart. That damned, delicate heart. Serena's fingers curled into tight fists, torn between appreciation and smoldering resentment. To Adrian, her cardiac condition seemed the only aspect of her worth noticing—never her as a person.

She inhaled deeply, deliberately injecting fragility into her tone. "Adrian, I was hoping you might do me a small favor."

The unusual request made his brow arch. "What is it?" Adrian asked, his forehead creasing reflexively.

"I've been invited to join a new variety show called Spotlight Night—" Serena abruptly cut herself off.

Her gaze swept across the bustling crowd before she motioned toward a quieter section of the mall. "It's too noisy here. There's a lovely bistro nearby with private dining rooms. Shall we continue our conversation over lunch?"

Adrian gave a curt nod and began moving in the indicated direction. Serena followed half a step behind, then deliberately reached out to lightly grasp his sleeve. Feeling the gentle tug, he slowed his pace and glanced at her hand. After a brief hesitation, he didn't shake her off, allowing her to guide him toward the restaurant's secluded booth.

Once seated, Serena eagerly picked up the menu, her voice bright as she described various dishes while making her selections. After ordering nearly a dozen items, she pushed the menu toward Adrian with a warm smile. "Adrian, would you like to add anything?"

He accepted the menu, gave it a perfunctory glance, then closed it decisively. "I'm not particularly hungry. This should suffice."

"Perfect," Serena told the waiter before turning back to Adrian with a shy smile. "I always want to sample everything, but my eyes are bigger than my stomach. You know how I despise food waste."

Adrian's response was matter-of-fact. "Aside from the two vegetarian dishes, the remainder can be boxed for later."

Her eyes sparkled with playful accusation. "Adrian, you don't even humor me anymore. You used to promise to help me finish everything."

His hand froze midway to his water glass before slowly returning it to the table. "Not in the mood for food today. Besides, when you leave for Azurevale, who will clean your plates then?"
###Chapter 407

The cheerful facade on Serena's face cracked.

Her delicate eyebrows drew together as she snatched up her napkin and flung it onto the table with an irritated sigh. "Must we discuss that woman during lunch?"

Adrian chose not to push further, his voice shifting to a carefully neutral tone as he smoothly redirected the conversation. "What was it you wanted to discuss earlier? Is it funding for the show? Name your price and I'll have the transfer processed immediately."

His hand disappeared into his tailored suit pocket, searching for his phone.

Serena interrupted sharply, her voice firm yet controlled. "This isn't about money."

A brief hesitation passed before her earlier frustration softened into something more vulnerable. Her voice dropped to a whisper as she confessed, "Vivian is participating in that show too. You know how the media loves comparing us. Could you... ask her to withdraw?"

The private dining room plunged into uncomfortable silence. Adrian sat motionless, his lips pressed into a thin line, deliberately ignoring Serena's request. His fingers absently tapped the edge of his phone as he read Ethan's incoming message, wondering about his assistant's whereabouts.

After typing a brief reply, he turned off the screen and began tracing the phone's edges, his expression unreadable.

Serena, seated across from him, turned her attention toward the decorative lattice partition. Through the intricate carvings, she spotted Ethan approaching with two women. One was unmistakably Vivian, radiating quiet elegance. The other, dressed in bold, statement-making attire, was Vivian's friend.

A spark of calculation ignited in Serena's eyes. Fortune was favoring her today. She'd only intended to "accidentally" bump into Adrian at Blackwood Group headquarters. But when she spotted his car outside Opal Galleria, she couldn't resist following him inside. Now, not only was Adrian here, but Vivian had appeared as well.

With Vivian as her unintended audience, Serena knew her performance needed to be Oscar-worthy. She wasn't just playing for Adrian's sympathy - she wanted Vivian to witness firsthand who Adrian would always choose.

Originally, Serena had planned to use the show as her stage to publicly reclaim her position as the future Mrs. Blackwood, especially in front of Vivian. When Adrian had shockingly announced his marriage to Vivian on air, it had been a devastating blow.

Serena had always viewed Adrian as untouchable, a man above such mundane emotions as love. The idea that she could ever capture his heart had seemed impossible.

When Vivian married Adrian, Serena hadn't been concerned. Without family connections or influence, how could some nobody possibly maintain her position as Mrs. Blackwood? In fact, Vivian's arrival had played perfectly into Serena's hands - creating a modern Cinderella story that would make her own eventual triumph seem inevitable.

But she never anticipated Adrian would actually fall for Vivian - to the point of abandoning his years of devotion to Serena. Tears welled in Serena's eyes as she fixed Adrian with a gaze brimming with longing. Her voice trembled with carefully measured emotion.

"Adrian, do you know true terror?" she whispered. "It's not living in darkness. It's being shown the light, having the colors of the world revealed to you... only to be cast back into the abyss."

Adrian's response was cool, detached. "I never said I'd abandon you, Serena. I promised you wouldn't return to your former life, and I intend to honor that. Your lifestyle will be maintained - even enhanced. I can transfer shares from several Azurevale companies into your name. That way, you'll—"
###Chapter 408

The words tore from her throat, raw and broken. "It was never about the money, Adrian! It's about how you made me feel."

His voice remained unnervingly calm. "The way I treated you then is exactly how I'll treat you now."

Serena's lips curved into a ghost of a smile that never touched her stormy eyes. Beneath the fragile facade, her gaze shattered like broken glass, the pain radiating through every fractured piece.

"I was your everything once," she whispered, the words barely audible. "Your chosen bride. Am I still that woman?"

A flicker of desperate hope danced in her eyes, fragile as a moth's wing against a hurricane's force.

Adrian hesitated. For the first time, shadows crossed his usually impassive features. His silence spoke volumes.

The air grew thick with unspoken words, and the fragile light in Serena's eyes dimmed to nothing. In a sudden burst of desperation, her fingers clutched at the fine wool of his tailored sleeve.

"Adrian," she begged, her voice trembling like autumn leaves. "Since you reunited with Vivian, I've kept my distance. Not a single call, not one text - I couldn't risk her misunderstanding. I've already lost you... I can't lose my career too."

Tears spilled down her cheeks like liquid silver as she continued, "Vivian only lost a reality show spot. With you behind her, the entire industry will bow at her feet. But for me... this could be the end of everything I've worked for."

There was a time when her tears would have shattered Adrian's resolve instantly. Now, uncertainty flickered across his face as he weighed his words with uncharacteristic caution.

Serena pressed her advantage, her voice softening to a vulnerable whisper. "Maybe... you could keep her identity as Mrs. Blackwood secret? Just to spare me the humiliation? As long as no one knows she's your wife, I won't become the industry's laughingstock."

Adrian's response was carefully measured, his tone deceptively warm. "Serena, you could never be a joke to me. You'll always hold a special place in my life."

Once, those words would have made her feel like the center of his universe. Now they rang hollow, their meaning twisted beyond recognition. To Serena, they sounded less like devotion and more like a carefully constructed lie.

Her gaze drifted past Adrian, locking onto the restaurant entrance where Vivian entered with Ethan. After a weighted pause, Serena spoke with quiet determination. "Help me this one last time, and I'll leave Crestwood by New Year's. I'll return to Azurevale, focus on my treatment, and disappear from your life forever."

Adrian's fingers stilled abruptly, his expression hardening with sudden decision. "Fine."

"I'll make sure Vivian withdraws from that reality show." The private room door swung open at that precise moment, revealing Vivian in the doorway. Her icy gaze pinned Adrian in place. "Since when do you make career decisions for me?"

Adrian turned toward her, his composure cracking as panic flashed in his eyes. "Vivian, what are you doing here?" His accusing glare shifted to Ethan, who stood frozen behind her.

Ethan pressed his lips into a tight line, beads of sweat forming at his temples. How could he have anticipated Serena's sudden appearance here?
###Chapter 409

Vivian's lips curled into an icy smile, her words laced with razor-sharp precision. "How amusing. Ethan claimed you came here to fetch me, yet now you're interrogating my presence. So tell me, which one of you is spinning fairy tales?"

The air grew thick with tension as Adrian and Vivian engaged in a silent battle of wills. Ethan stood trapped between them like a tightrope walker, his collar suddenly too tight against his throat. Normally composed around Adrian, this confrontation left him paralyzed.

Audrey, usually Vivian's most vocal defender, hovered near the doorway, her conflicted gaze shifting between them. Since beginning her relationship with Dominic, Audrey had developed a more measured approach, her once-fiery impulses tempered by love. She knew intervening now would only escalate tensions between Vivian and Adrian, giving Serena—always the opportunist—the perfect opening.

Serena shattered the silence with practiced innocence. "Ms. Hartley, please don't blame Adrian. He wasn't hiding anything. I simply stopped by for lunch and we happened to cross paths." Her hand fluttered toward her purse. "I can show you my schedule—I just finished a commercial shoot."

Vivian remained unmoved, her polite smile never reaching her eyes. "Ms. Whitmore, whatever disagreement exists between my husband and me is private. Even my dearest friend hasn't intervened, so an outsider certainly shouldn't. Boundaries matter, don't you agree?"

Serena's hand froze mid-air, color flooding her cheeks. After an awkward pause, she returned her phone to her bag, murmuring, "I meant no offense."

Vivian strode to Adrian's table, deliberately pulling out a chair. Audrey followed, practically throwing herself into the seat beside her friend. Her silent presence spoke volumes.

Adrian broke the silence first. "I came to pick you up," he said evenly, though his fingers betrayed him with restless tapping. "I didn't expect you with Ethan. Serena was... coincidental." The words rang true, yet carried an undercurrent of something indefinable.

Vivian nodded, her assessing gaze never wavering. After a beat, she asked, "Which show did you decide I wouldn't be doing?"

Adrian's brow furrowed in genuine confusion. "What show?" He turned to Serena. "Serena, what's this about?"

A cold laugh escaped Vivian's lips. She reached for Adrian's water glass, took a deliberate sip, then set it down with a sharp clink. "How fascinating," she drawled. "You made decisions about my career without even knowing the details."

Serena's smile faltered when Adrian, without hesitation, picked up the glass Vivian had just used and drank from it. The act was shocking—Adrian's notorious germaphobia was legendary. In all their years together, he'd never shared utensils, let alone drank after her. Their physical contact had always been carefully controlled—brief handholds, the occasional hug when she was ill.

Unwanted images flooded Serena's mind—Adrian and Vivian tangled together, sharing intimacies far beyond anything she'd experienced. Her nails bit into her palms, the pain anchoring her to the present.

"The show is Spotlight Night," Serena explained, forcing steadiness into her voice. "Blazing Horizon's producers wanted to promote the drama and asked me to appear. With all the online comparisons between our performances, I thought it best to avoid negative publicity for both our sakes."
###Chapter 410

Vivian crossed her legs with effortless grace, her fingers lightly resting on Adrian's forearm. The commanding aura radiating from her every gesture was undeniable - like a queen putting an upstart courtier in her place. Her voice carried a deceptively soft edge. "Your performance was the one lacking finesse. Even if this scandal resurfaces, how does it damage me? Had they let it trend longer, my acting skills and beauty might have gained more recognition. More opportunities. Since you're so unwilling to be compared to me, why don't you withdraw instead? Why should I?" She didn't even glance at Serena, each word striking its target with surgical precision.

Serena's mask of composure cracked momentarily before she steadied herself. Moving with deliberate slowness, she settled into another chair. "Ms. Hartley, I've been trying to maintain decorum. Please don't provoke me like this. My heart condition... if something were to happen, the consequences could be severe."

"Enough, Vivian." Adrian's voice cut through the tension like a blade, sharp and final. "Stop this unnecessary aggression."

Vivian froze. The practiced calm on her face wavered, surprise flickering in her eyes. That familiar reprimand sent a bitter wave of recognition crashing over her.

The scene felt hauntingly familiar - an echo of countless past confrontations. Had all their progress been an illusion? Every tentative step toward understanding, every fragile moment of connection - were they just mirages?

Across the table, Serena's lips curved into a subtle smile, her earlier distress replaced by quiet triumph. Despite some unexpected turns, the outcome remained unchanged. Between her and Vivian, Adrian would always choose her. His sense of duty, his need to protect her fragile health - these were constants that never wavered.

When Adrian saw Vivian's reaction, his tone softened. "Serena has agreed to go to Azurevale."

At these words, Serena's carefully constructed pride shattered. Her eyes widened in stunned disbelief. She couldn't believe Adrian would discuss their private arrangement so openly with Vivian, exposing the transactional nature of their agreement. In the past, he'd never felt the need to explain himself to Vivian, maintaining an emotional distance that had seemed insurmountable.

As a woman, Serena understood how such silent treatment could erode a relationship over time, breeding doubt and insecurity. They say old habits die hard, yet Adrian had changed profoundly for Vivian. His concern for her feelings was palpable - he cared deeply about her emotional state. The realization struck Serena like lightning: Adrian had fallen in love with Vivian.

The discovery sent her heart racing with panic.

Vivian, however, had no desire to further engage with Serena. She knew too much controversy could label her as difficult to work with. Still, she didn't immediately concede - she didn't want Adrian to think her too easily swayed. After a calculated pause, she said coolly, "Just this once. There won't be a next time."

Adrian responded firmly, "You have my word. Serena won't be taking any new contracts for the foreseeable future, so this situation won't repeat."

Vivian arched an eyebrow. "And if it does?"

Adrian glanced at Serena before answering, "If it happens again, I'll personally ensure her withdrawal from the project."

"Fine," Vivian finally acquiesced, her tone laced with deliberate indifference.
###Chapter 411

Serena's complexion turned ashen. After a brief pause, she managed to whisper to Adrian, "Adrian, I'm not feeling well. Could you take me to the hospital?"

Though she'd pretended illness before, this time her discomfort was genuine - her chest constricted as if an invisible hand squeezed her heart.

Adrian glanced at Vivian, about to speak. Vivian rose gracefully and addressed Ethan, "What are you waiting for? Help Adrian take her to the emergency room."

Caught off guard while formulating an excuse, Adrian said, "I'll get Serena to the hospital and come back for you."

Vivian responded smoothly, "No need. Audrey drove here. We'll return together."

Audrey chimed in cheerfully, "Exactly! We haven't even had dinner yet. After we eat, I'll bring Vivian home. Don't worry - if anything comes up, I'll call Dominic."

Adrian produced a black card from his pocket, pressing it into Vivian's palm before brushing a kiss against her temple. "Buy whatever you like after dinner. This mall belongs to Blackwood Group, and I've personally ensured management won't let anything like the pen incident happen again."

Vivian immediately understood his reference to the previous confrontation. Her voice softened involuntarily. "Keep me updated when everything's settled."

"Of course," Adrian nodded. "I'll report everything to you."

At the word "report," Serena's pallor worsened. Adrian effortlessly lifted her and carried her out.

As they exited, Serena glimpsed Vivian calmly sipping tea at the table. Though she'd successfully drawn Adrian away using familiar tactics, the victory felt hollow this time.

With their departure, only Audrey and Vivian remained in the private dining room.

Audrey flashed an approving thumbs-up. "Not a single vulgar word today, yet it felt incredibly satisfying. Like watching the heroine in a drama elegantly exposing the antagonist's schemes."

She replayed the scene mentally, then added with mild regret, "Though you're still too merciful. You shouldn't have let Adrian take that scheming woman to the hospital. She always claims heart problems - probably just another act."

"I never wished Serena harm. Besides, if his heart isn't mine, keeping him physically close changes nothing. He chose to send her to Azurevale. For now, I'll let her be," Vivian replied, toying with the black card in her fingers, its platinum lettering glinting.

Audrey's gaze dropped to the card. "Where a man invests his wealth, there lies his heart. Don't hesitate to spend his money now. When you said you'd leave empty-handed earlier, I nearly fainted from shock."

She punctuated this with an exaggerated eye-roll, pinching the bridge of her nose.

Vivian pocketed the card and stood. "Let's go find somewhere decent to eat."

After an enjoyable dinner, Vivian reluctantly indulged Audrey's insistence on shopping. Passing an opulently decorated lingerie boutique, Audrey shot her a mischievous look. "Care to browse?"

By the time Vivian returned to Seabreeze Villa, midnight had come. She texted Adrian, then sank onto the sofa intending to rest briefly. Before she knew it, sleep claimed her.

Adrian arrived home to find Vivian curled on the sofa, phone clutched tightly like a security blanket. The sight reminded him of a kitten seeking comfort. This familiar scene - Vivian waiting up for him only to doze off - had once been routine. Now that she'd returned to his life, these moments held new sweetness. Her unconscious vigil spoke volumes about her care for him.
###Chapter 412

Adrian approached quietly, shrugging off his tailored suit jacket. He grabbed a cashmere throw from the nearby armchair and settled beside Vivian. With careful movements, he draped the soft fabric over her sleeping form and gently pried her phone from her fingers.

Vivian stirred instantly, her lashes fluttering open. Recognizing Adrian, her body relaxed as she discarded the pillow and curled into his embrace. "You're home?" she murmured, her voice thick with sleep.

Adrian's gaze flickered to the unread notifications on her screen. A tender smile curved his lips. "I texted you hours ago. You shouldn't wait up for me here - you'll get chilled."

"How's Serena?" Vivian asked, brushing past his concern as she sat up straighter. "Everything went smoothly?"

"Perfectly. I accompanied her to the appointment, and Miranda's with her now," Adrian reassured her, tucking a stray lock behind her ear. The drowsy haze in Vivian's emerald eyes couldn't mask their luminous quality, making her even more mesmerizing than usual.

He'd encountered countless beautiful women in his life, yet none had ever stirred his soul.

To him, physical beauty was as disposable as last season's fashion.

But Vivian? She made his pulse race with just a glance.

He couldn't deny that even before love took root, her beauty had always affected him profoundly.

That memory surfaced - Vivian approaching him with tears glistening on her porcelain cheeks, determination blazing in her eyes. His defenses had crumbled instantly.

Rising smoothly, he scooped her into his arms.

"I'm perfectly capable of walking," she protested weakly, her cheeks flushing pink.

"I enjoy carrying you," Adrian teased, giving her a playful bounce that made her gasp. "You weigh less than my gym bag."

Her arms flew around his neck instinctively.

When she realized their faces were mere inches apart, she impulsively brushed her lips against his before burying her face in his chest.

Adrian wasn't lying - holding her required no effort at all.

He carried her to their bedroom and deposited her gently on the king-sized bed.

Any remnants of sleep had vanished from Vivian's eyes, replaced by sparkling awareness.

"Awake now?" Adrian asked with a roguish grin, noting her flushed cheeks.

Before she could retort, his fingers made quick work of her silk blouse, revealing delicate lace beneath. The fabric hinted tantalizingly at the creamy skin it concealed.

In stark contrast, Adrian's dress shirt remained impeccably fastened, every button secured up to his throat.

He leaned in, his fingertips tracing hypnotic patterns along her collarbone. With a deft motion, he tugged the lace aside, pressing his lips to the exposed skin.

Vivian gasped, her body arching instinctively toward his touch.

###Chapter 413

His fingers trailed down from the curve of her waist, tracing the dip of her hips.

A playful smack landed on her backside, followed by his husky command. "Lift."

Vivian obeyed, arching slightly as Adrian slid her pants down, his knuckles grazing the delicate skin of her inner thigh.

The contrast of his calloused yet gentle touch sent electric waves across her flesh.

She bit down on her lower lip, stifling a moan—but it escaped anyway, louder than she intended.

His hands were relentless, mapping every secret place that made her shiver.

Her body quivered beneath him, eyes glazed with need, voice thick with desire.

He paused, a low chuckle rumbling in his chest. "Say my name," he murmured.

Her gaze darkened, all shyness melting away as she whispered, "Adrian... I need you."

Something primal snapped inside him at her plea.

Seeing the hunger in his eyes, she reached for his belt, fingers working quickly to free him from restraint.

Adrian Blackwood could hold back no longer.

He moved with wild abandon, every thrust desperate, every touch burning with unrestrained need.

He hooked Vivian’s legs over his arms and drove into her, deep and unrelenting.

She gasped, caught between pleasure and pain, teetering on the edge of bliss.

Her hands pressed weakly against his chest, torn between pushing him away and pulling him closer.

But her body won, craving more of his intensity.

Noticing her exhaustion, Adrian slid a pillow beneath her hips, lifting her slightly to ease the strain.

Her legs locked around his waist instinctively, anchoring herself to him.

Then, without warning, he stood, lifting her with him as he carried her toward the full-length mirror.

Their tangled reflection stared back—no space, no secrets between them.

The sight ignited something deeper in Vivian, the visual of their passion making her pulse race.

Adrian turned her to face the mirror, his large hands guiding her hips as he moved.

He leaned in, lips brushing her ear. "You're breathtaking."

Even after all their nights together, the exposure made her cheeks burn.

She tried to look away, but Adrian wouldn’t allow it.

His pace quickened, sending her spiraling toward another climax.

Her body trembled in his arms, yet he showed no sign of stopping.

How does he have this much stamina? she wondered, dazed.

Finally, he stilled, pulling her tightly against him.

His voice softened. "Let me draw you a bath."
###Chapter 414

Vivian's weary eyes narrowed with suspicion as she caught the mischievous glint in Adrian's gaze. "I can manage on my own," she murmured hoarsely.

Yet Adrian effortlessly lifted her into his arms, carrying her toward the marble bathroom while disregarding her feeble protests.

True to form, his interpretation of bathing proved far from chaste.

Several hours later, Vivian's voice broke with exhaustion as she sobbed against his shoulder. "It's too much... I can't—"

Her words dissolved into shuddering breaths.

"If we continue, I'll shatter completely."

Only then did Adrian relent, finally heeding her desperate pleas.

He perched her gently on the vanity counter, parting her trembling thighs to examine the angry marks marring her delicate skin. "Be still, darling," he murmured, reaching for the medicinal cream. "Let me tend to you."

As he leaned closer, his movements stilled abruptly. His darkened gaze traced the vivid evidence of their passion with possessive intensity.

An unmistakable expression of male satisfaction flickered across his chiseled features.

He pressed a reverent kiss to one particularly sensitive mark before continuing his ministrations.

Vivian melted bonelessly beneath his attentive care.

When his lips finally claimed hers again, she surrendered to the kiss despite her earlier protests.

"See?" Adrian teased, his thumb brushing her swollen lower lip. "You're far more resilient than you believe."

Vivian managed a weak swat at his shoulder, her fingers lacking any real force.

Adrian's deep chuckle vibrated against her skin, but he mercifully didn't push further.

Instead, he meticulously cleansed every inch of her, reapplied the soothing ointment, and towel-dried her damp curls.

He dressed her in a scandalously sheer nightdress, but Vivian shook her head weakly.

"Pajamas," she insisted, her voice barely above a whisper.

"You'll overheat," Adrian countered with an infuriating grin, sweeping her back into his arms before she could protest further.

He tucked her beneath the silk sheets with surprising gentleness, but when his hands began wandering, she caught his wrist firmly. "Absolutely not tonight."

Adrian merely pressed a kiss to her forehead. "Rest now, my love." For once, he honored his word, curling his powerful frame around hers without further demands.

The Next Morning

Golden sunlight danced across Vivian's eyelids as consciousness slowly returned. Her fingers stretched across the mattress, seeking familiar warmth, but encountered only cool emptiness. Blinking sleepily, she pushed upright, wincing as sore muscles protested the movement. The tantalizing aroma of freshly brewed coffee and sizzling bacon drifted up the staircase.

Gritting her teeth against the discomfort, Vivian shuffled toward the railing. Below, Adrian moved with effortless grace between the kitchen appliances, his rolled sleeves revealing corded forearms as he arranged breakfast on a silver tray. Sensing her presence, he glanced upward, his stern features softening instantly.

"Morning, sleepyhead," he called, holding up a steaming mug. "Come down before your eggs get cold."

Vivian lingered, watching the domestic scene unfold with unexpected warmth. Memories surfaced of their early marriage—when she'd tiptoed around him like a frightened rabbit, viewing him as her rescuer from familial chaos. She'd poured her entire being into serving him, mistaking devotion for love. That version of love had nearly destroyed her.
###Chapter 415

The dynamics had shifted completely. Seeing Adrian fuss over her, preparing meals and ensuring her comfort, Vivian felt an unprecedented sense of partnership. That suffocating inferiority complex had vanished.

For the first time, she understood what real love felt like. In that quiet kitchen moment, an epiphany struck her: love wasn't about keeping score or self-erasure. She'd been approaching their relationship all wrong, positioning herself as some indebted servant rather than an equal participant.

The Blackwoods didn't need submissive maids - Adrian certainly didn't want some martyr. He needed his match. A soft smile played on her lips as she turned toward their ensuite to freshen up.

Vivian had just applied her lip tint when her phone vibrated violently on the marble vanity.

The message from Ivory Phoenix Productions turned her blood cold. Accusations of plagiarism. Demand for repayment. Threat of legal action over contract breach.

Her fingers trembled slightly as she typed, "This must be a mistake. Which specific content is allegedly plagiarized?"

The reply took agonizing minutes: "Don't play innocent. Lydia brought you into this project. We'd hate to embarrass everyone involved."

Vivian's response was immediate: "Either provide concrete evidence or prepare for court." Her jaw tightened with barely contained fury.

Just as she reached for her clutch, another notification flashed - a screenshot from an ancient blog post. Her breath caught. The lyrics in question were adapted from poetry she'd written years ago under her pseudonym, Vivian Hartley.

A dry laugh escaped her. Of all things to be accused of stealing - her own damn work.

She fired off a clarification about her dual identity, only to be met with a glaring red error symbol. Blocked. Just like that.

Vivian stared at her reflection in the vanity mirror, equal parts baffled and amused. Well, that escalated quickly. But the initial panic subsided as she realized this was entirely her own mess to handle.

Descending the spiral staircase, the aromatic symphony of Adrian's cooking greeted her first. The dining table was a masterpiece of contrasts - Szechuan peppercorns dancing alongside delicate truffle aromas, a perfect representation of their blended tastes.

"Careful, Mr. Blackwood," she teased, sliding into her chair with a playful glint, "at this rate you'll single-handedly redefine modern husband goals."

Adrian placed a perfectly seared scallop on her plate, his smile crinkling the corners of his storm-gray eyes. "All inspired by my remarkable wife," he murmured, the warmth in his voice melting her remaining tension.
###Chapter 416

Vivian's breath caught when Adrian spoke with unexpected tenderness. Though they played the perfect couple in public displays, such softness was rare in their private moments—except during their most intimate times. A fleeting wish crossed her mind that this golden period would never end.

The vibration of Adrian's phone shattered the moment. He glanced at the screen dismissively before silencing it. "Ethan's confirmed Gwendolyn's permanent relocation from Crestwood," he remarked casually.

Since that confrontation at Opal Galleria when Ethan had orchestrated Gwendolyn's removal, Vivian hadn't given it much thought. Now, with Adrian bringing it up, fragments of memory resurfaced. "I always sensed she harbored some personal vendetta against me," Vivian mused, "though I can't recall ever interacting with her directly."

Adrian shrugged with practiced indifference. "Some people are simply wired for malice. Her fixation on you likely had little to do with you personally."

Vivian shook her head, dark curls swaying. "No, this was different. My intuition screamed there was something specific between us."

Adrian's lips curved in that reassuring smile that always made her pulse quicken. "She's been permanently exiled from Crestwood. Don't waste energy deciphering toxic minds."

"Alright," Vivian conceded, though an uneasy suspicion lingered at the edges of her consciousness.

Adrian replenished her plate before attending to his own meal. The clink of silverware filled the comfortable silence as Vivian stole glances at him. The morning light sculpted his aristocratic features—the sharp jawline, the perfect slope of his nose, the elegant way his fingers cradled the porcelain bowl—transforming him into a Renaissance masterpiece.

Caught mid-observation, Adrian's eyes glinted with amusement. "Like what you see, darling?"

Vivian propped her chin on one hand, lips quirking. "You're rather decorative, I'll give you that."

His eyebrow arched, voice dripping with suggestion. "We've never christened the dining table, have we?"

Heat flooded Vivian's cheeks as she swatted his arm. "Must everything devolve into innuendo with you?"

"Indulgence is the spice of life," he countered, dark eyes smoldering with promises that made her thighs clench in remembered pleasure.

Recalling how her legs still trembled from last night's exploits, Vivian raised her hands in surrender. "Mercy, please."

Adrian's smirk softened. He'd already pushed her limits thoroughly the previous evening. With effortless grace, he shifted topics. "Plans for this afternoon?"

The sudden change made Vivian blink before answering decisively: "The office. After reviewing our financials, I'm restructuring the team to revitalize operations."

Adrian sipped his coffee. "Funding's available if needed. Consider it an investment—or loan, whichever eases your pride." A thoughtful pause. "How will you handle existing contracts?"

He reclined slightly, gaze intent. This wasn't idle curiosity—Adrian genuinely wanted to understand her strategy, to mentor rather than dictate. His approach had evolved from solving her problems to empowering her solutions.

The unspoken shift in their dynamic hung between them, as tangible as the morning sunlight gilding their breakfast table.
###Chapter 417

Adrian could have simply bailed out Dawson Enterprises with his wealth, but that would defeat the purpose. Watching Vivian reclaim control of the company her mother had sacrificed everything to build—the same company Vivian had fought tooth and nail to protect—held far greater significance.

His gaze was intense, like a professor waiting for a student to present their thesis. Vivian met his eyes, recognizing his silent challenge, and began laying out her strategy.

"I've secured an alternative supplier for raw materials. My plan involves prepayment to guarantee timely deliveries. Missing deadlines would only compound our financial penalties. Defaulting isn't an option at this critical juncture."

She exhaled sharply, frustration flashing across her delicate features. "It's like playing a rigged game where the house controls all the cards. The odds are impossible."

Her long lashes cast shadows as she looked down, fingers absently tracing patterns on her fork. "There's something suspicious about our current supplier. I need to investigate their operations thoroughly—find any weaknesses we can leverage to reduce damages."

Adrian's lips curved slightly, approval glinting in his dark eyes. "Spot on."

"That supplier has a history of problematic contracts," Adrian revealed. "Ethan's already gathered evidence and negotiated termination terms. He'll meet us at Dawson Enterprises this afternoon to finalize the cancellation and partial reimbursement. I'll accompany you."

Vivian's eyes widened in surprise, momentarily speechless. She hadn't anticipated Adrian working behind the scenes to resolve such a pivotal issue. A genuine smile touched her lips, gratitude shining through.

Adrian leaned in, his smirk turning predatory. "I must admit, you've got sharper business instincts than Richard ever did."

Vivian tilted her chin up defiantly. "Comes from my mother's side."

His hand moved to tousle her hair, his expression softening with concern. "Managing a corporation while maintaining your acting career and screenwriting—you're stretching yourself too thin."

She braced for criticism, shoulders squaring. "Nothing worth having comes easy."

Adrian interrupted with a shake of his head. "I'm not suggesting you quit. But you shouldn't carry this burden alone. I'll assign two competent assistants to lighten your load. Delegation is an essential skill, Vivian."

Her posture relaxed. In an uncharacteristic moment of vulnerability, she leaned forward and brushed her lips against his cheek, leaving behind the faint aroma of braised beef.

Adrian grimaced theatrically, reaching for a wet wipe.

When they arrived at Dawson Enterprises, Ethan stood waiting in the marble lobby. He handed Vivian a thick dossier.

She flipped through the meticulously compiled documents, impressed by the depth of information—far exceeding what her own investigations had uncovered. The evidence of Adrian's behind-the-scenes efforts was undeniable.
###Chapter 418

The moment Vivian finished scanning the document, Ethan leaned closer. "Dawson Enterprises has already liquidated their shares."

Her head snapped up. "At what price?"

Ethan's lips curved knowingly. "Fifteen percent below your initial offer. Even discounted, finding buyers was like selling ice in winter." His voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. "The supplier crisis remains our little secret. Mr. Blackwood insisted we wait until after the transaction. Had it leaked, those shares would've doubled in value."

Vivian opened her mouth to inquire about the buyer when headlights cut through the parking lot. A sleek black sedan pulled alongside Adrian's vehicle.

Twin figures emerged - Richard and Daphne Dawson. Their faces showed no surprise at Vivian's presence.

Daphne's smile stretched like taffy. "What a delightful surprise, Vivian! Fancy meeting you here."

Richard's sneer could curdle milk. "Ungrateful child. Did you truly believe you could outmaneuver me? I'd rather burn those shares than see you control my company."

Before Vivian could retort, a third figure emerged - a portly man in a tailored suit. The Dawsons' smugness evaporated like morning dew.

"Mr. Ramirez," Daphne simpered, voice dripping saccharine. She turned to Vivian with razor-edged sweetness. "Allow me to introduce Mr. Ramirez of Horizon Technologies. Our new majority shareholder."

Vivian's gaze sharpened. Horizon was Crestwood's fastest-growing tech conglomerate.

The newcomer approached Adrian and Vivian with obsequious deference. "Mr. Blackwood, Mrs. Blackwood," he greeted, bowing slightly. His round face glistened with nervous sweat, giving him the appearance of an overeager spaniel.

Richard muttered to Daphne, "The man owns thirty percent of Horizon yet grovels like a servant. Pathetic."

Adrian silenced Ramirez with a microscopic head shake.

Richard stepped forward, smirking at Vivian. "Perfect timing! I was just taking Mr. Ramirez to meet the board. They should know who truly holds the reins now."

Vivian caught the silent exchange between Adrian and Ramirez. The newcomer's deference suggested an ally, not an adversary.

Oblivious, the Dawsons strutted ahead, radiating smug satisfaction. Vivian turned to Adrian. "What aren't you telling me?"

His lips quirked in that infuriating half-smile. Ethan leaned in, eyes twinkling. "Patience, Mrs. Blackwood. The show's just beginning."
###Chapter 419

The glass doors slid open as Vivian Hartley entered Dawson Enterprises with Adrian Blackwood and Mr. Sinclair. Daphne Fairchild and her followers trailed closely behind. Employees immediately clustered around Richard Dawson, exchanging pleasantries. But the moment Vivian stepped into view, their smiles froze.

The Dawson family had been spreading whispers that Vivian was merely Mrs. Blackwood in title, claiming Adrian held no real affection for her. Yet here he was, accompanying her to the company for the second time. The first visit could've been written off as a show, but this? This meant something.

Everyone knew a single project from the Blackwood Group outweighed the entire floundering Dawson empire. Adrian had no business being here personally unless something major was happening. The atmosphere shifted instantly - employees became cautious observers, weighing both sides carefully. Though Mr. Sinclair currently held the largest share percentage, Vivian's backing from the Blackwood Group cast an undeniable shadow. Highfield Company paled in comparison. Like seasoned chess players, everyone moved with calculated precision.

Several executives instinctively retreated, creating subtle distance from Richard, choosing to observe before picking sides. Vivian strode forward and claimed a chair. Eyebrows raised. When she'd been the sole buyer, sitting might've been acceptable. But now with Mr. Sinclair as primary shareholder and her senior, how dare she sit while he stood?

Richard seized the moment to play patriarch. "Vivian, have you forgotten all decorum? Mr. Sinclair is your elder and the company's principal shareholder. You sit while your betters stand? You represent not just yourself but the Blackwood family as their daughter-in-law and major shareholder. Their reputation rests on your actions."

Adrian's icy gaze cut to Richard. "The Blackwood name isn't so fragile it depends on where a woman sits."

Richard's mouth snapped shut. Daphne's face twisted with resentment as she glared at Vivian. How had this cunning woman ensnared Adrian? He'd seemed indifferent to Vivian before, yet now, two years into marriage, they behaved like newlyweds.

Vivian calmly met Mr. Sinclair's eyes. "Would you care to sit, Mr. Sinclair?"

Startled, Mr. Sinclair grabbed a nearby cushion and placed it on Vivian's chair. "Please, Mrs. Blackwood, you take the seat. This chair seems rather hard. The cushion will help. I should stand - need to lose some weight anyway."

Ethan brought a chair for Adrian, who adjusted his suit jacket before sitting. The moment he settled, an undeniable authority radiated from him, making everyone nearby tense.

Vivian locked eyes with Adrian briefly, drawing strength from his steady gaze before addressing the room. "The company's past troubles end today. Those wishing to leave will receive compensation. For those staying - understand this: the old ways of exploiting the system won't be tolerated."

Many present had been Catherine Sutton's picks - talented individuals Richard had sidelined when he took control, even selling shares to new investors. As finances worsened, their frustration grew until they joined the corruption, charging personal expenses as business costs.

From shareholders to managers, they'd picked the company clean like vultures. That it survived this long was miraculous - perhaps Catherine's spirit watching over it.
###Chapter 420

The room buzzed with doubtful murmurs as Vivian Hartley stood before them. To these seasoned executives, she was just a twenty-something newlywed who'd never held a real job. What business acumen could a sheltered housewife possibly possess?

Yet with Adrian Blackwood's imposing presence beside her, they swallowed their skepticism. Their eyes darted between Vivian and Mr. Montoya, who watched the proceedings with an unreadable smile that never wavered.

Richard Dawson and Daphne Fairchild exchanged puzzled glances. What game was Mr. Montoya playing? Vivian caught his expression too.

That subtle encouragement ignited Vivian's resolve. She straightened her spine, crossing her ankles with deliberate grace. "Dawson Enterprises' legacy proves our collective strength. Moving forward requires that same unity." Her manicured finger tapped the conference table. "Substantial contributors will receive equity shares. We've purged the deadwood - now's our moment to rebuild."

Her voice remained velvet soft, yet carried steel beneath. The room stilled, executives leaning forward despite themselves.

Richard's face purpled with rage. "Mr. Montoya holds controlling interest now! Who authorized you to make decisions?"

Vivian's emerald eyes turned glacial. "You liquidated your stake, Father. This discussion exceeds your... diminished capacity." Her lips curled. "Frankly, your presence here is charitable."

Richard's hand twitched upward - until Adrian's lethal glare froze him mid-motion. The older man deflated like a punctured balloon.

Turning to Mr. Montoya, Richard forced a conciliatory tone. "Sir, these shares represent significant liabilities. I'd hate to see you inherit such complications."

Vivian's laugh was sharp as shattered crystal. "How noble of you to offload toxic assets onto others." She tilted her head. "Unless you'd prefer to reclaim them? The SEC penalties do make fascinating reading."

"You insolent—"

Mr. Montoya finally intervened, producing a leather-bound dossier. "My expertise lies elsewhere. These shares will be transferred to Ms. Hartley immediately." He slid documents across the mahogany surface. "My role concludes upon her signature."

Vivian's gaze found Adrian's. His subtle nod confirmed everything - this had been their plan all along.

Richard's chair screeched across marble as he surged upright. "This is treachery!" Spittle flew from his lips. "You conspired with them!"

Mr. Montoya's genial mask slipped. "I purchased assets. Their disposition is my prerogative." His smile turned knife-sharp. "Unless you'd care to reacquire them? At current market valuation, of course."

The air crackled with tension as Vivian accepted the fountain pen Adrian offered. The nib hovered above parchment as every executive held their breath.

Richard's voice dropped to a venomous whisper. "You'll regret this, daughter."

Vivian's signature flowed across the page in elegant loops. "No, Father." She met his glare unflinching. "That privilege belongs solely to you."
###Chapter 421

Vivian stifled a laugh. Mr. Pembroke's words cut like a razor. Even Richard, usually oblivious, finally understood that Adrian and Mr. Pembroke had set an elaborate trap for him.

It took him several seconds to compose himself before he shot Vivian a mocking look. "The company's already sinking. Taking over now means inheriting nothing but debt. What exactly do you hope to gain?"

He turned to Adrian with a sneer. "Mr. Blackwood, not even your family fortune can sustain such financial bleeding."

The supplier had a sleazy demeanor, his phone case displaying a scantily clad model. His small, piggish eyes gleamed with predatory interest.

When his gaze landed on Vivian, he immediately felt the icy daggers of Adrian's glare.

Noticing the murderous chill in Adrian's eyes, the man quickly averted his gaze and smoothly said, "Good afternoon, Mr. Blackwood, Ms. Hartley. Ms. Hartley, you're absolutely stunning today."

Adrian's voice turned arctic. "She's my wife. You will address her as Mrs. Blackwood."

The man adjusted instantly, flashing greasy smiles. "My apologies, Mrs. Blackwood."

Richard stared at the supplier in disbelief. "What the hell are you doing here?" he demanded, clearly blindsided.

Ethan stepped forward, introducing the man to Vivian. "This is our former raw materials supplier."

Vivian immediately recognized him - the same man she'd seen Richard and Daphne getting into a car with at the hospital, that garish doll identical to his phone case's wallpaper sitting in the backseat.

The supplier completely ignored Richard, focusing solely on Vivian. "There were... irregularities with our previous contract," he explained smoothly. "My company takes full responsibility for the defective materials and will compensate all losses."

Richard's face turned purple with rage. "Are you betraying me? This is a setup!"

The supplier took a deliberate step back, voice turning cold. "Mind your accusations. I've always conducted business ethically - unlike some who deliberately sabotage their own companies for personal gain." He shot Richard a meaningful look. "You've made quite the profit from our previous dealings, haven't you?"

He then handed several documents and a check to Ethan. "Mr. Blackwood, Mrs. Blackwood, I won't take more of your time. I hope we can collaborate properly in the future."

Neither Adrian nor Vivian acknowledged him, but the man seemed unfazed. With one last contemptuous glance at Richard, he strode out of Dawson Enterprises.

The realization hit Richard like a truck. With the materials issue resolved, the company could easily secure new partners to fulfill the orders. Not only would this prevent losses, but it could generate massive profits.

This project had always been a golden opportunity, but Dawson Enterprises lacked the technology and capital to execute it properly. Instead of handling it correctly, Richard had conspired with shady suppliers, taking kickbacks while leaving Vivian to deal with the fallout.

Now with Vivian in charge and Adrian's unlimited resources backing her, how could Richard let such easy profits slip through his fingers?

His mind raced for solutions, sweat beading on his forehead. The game wasn't over yet. Not by a long shot.

The office tension thickened as Richard's calculating gaze darted between Vivian and Adrian. He'd underestimated them before. That mistake wouldn't happen again.

Vivian met his stare unflinchingly, her fingers subtly intertwining with Adrian's. Together, they formed an impenetrable fortress - one Richard would soon learn couldn't be breached.
###Chapter 422

Adrian Blackwood's gaze darkened with calculation as he turned to Mr. Pembroke, forcing a tight smile. "Mr. Pembroke," he began.

"Pembroke, I've reconsidered. I want my shares returned. I'll pay an additional fifteen percent premium. Make it twenty if that's what it takes."

"Not even double would convince me!" Mr. Pembroke scoffed, waving his hand dismissively. "The shares belong to Ms. Hartley now. Breaking my word for profit? I'd lose all credibility in business circles."

He accepted the contract copy from Vivian with a polite nod. "Mr. Blackwood, Mrs. Blackwood, if you'll excuse me, I have pressing matters to attend to. I anticipate our future collaborations."

Vivian bit back a smile at his performance. The man was clearly on her side yet maintaining perfect decorum. She inclined her head gracefully. "Thank you for your time, Mr. Pembroke."

As the door closed behind him, a silver-haired executive in a faded blazer stood. "Ms. Hartley," his voice carried quiet determination. "I'll remain to help rebuild. Your mother gave me my first break when no one else would. Richard and the others only cared about quick profits—they destroyed everything she built."

Vivian studied the man's weathered face. She recognized him from the engineering department. Both her research and Ethan's reports confirmed his impeccable record—underpaid yet loyal for decades. She vaguely recalled seeing him at her mother's memorial.

One by one, other employees voiced their commitment to stay.

The tide had turned. With the Blackwood Group's backing, new possibilities emerged.

Vivian produced a document. "Our preliminary development plan. Certain projects require restructuring. Consider this draft open for discussion—I welcome all suggestions." Her gaze swept the room. "Any other business?"

The atmosphere transformed. Where gloom had lingered, now buzzed with animated discussion. Employees who'd judged Vivian based on Richard's disparagement now saw her sharp market analysis and clear vision—nothing like the clueless socialite he'd described.

Several exchanged relieved glances, grateful they'd held their tongues earlier. Some mused that Richard's greatest failures weren't business losses, but the remarkable women he'd underestimated—his ex-wife who'd been his foundation, and Vivian who now revitalized the company he'd run into the ground.

Fortune favors those who recognize its worth.
###Chapter 423

The studio lights blazed down as Serena Whitmore filmed the live broadcast of Spotlight Night. Everything had gone perfectly until the final Q&A segment.

A female guest leaned forward with genuine curiosity. "Serena, rumors say you recently acquired a screenplay. Are you venturing into production?"

Serena's practiced smile never wavered. "That was indeed my plan - to both produce and star in my passion project." Her expression turned solemn. "But the writing agency assigned me a plagiarist who stole from Vivian Hartley's personal blogs."

She exhaled softly, fingers tracing the edge of her champagne flute. "I value original artistry above all. No matter the financial loss, I refuse to compromise my principles."

"Vivian's work has always inspired me," Serena continued. "When this writer's sample mirrored her distinctive voice, I wanted to support new talent." Her lips tightened. "She claimed financial hardship, so I advanced sixty percent payment before seeing a completed draft."

Another guest nearly choked on her drink. "You prepaid sixty percent to an unknown writer?"

"The full contract was one million dor," Serena confirmed, her tone laced with quiet outrage. "For nothing but a three-page sample. I'll admit my literary knowledge is limited, which makes me respect true scholars even more. To think someone would exploit that admiration—"

The studio audience erupted. Even the veteran host looked shocked. "A million dor advance for an untested writer?" Social media exploded within seconds.

"I've written four produced screenplays and still get paid peanuts per episode! This is outrageous!" tweeted one industry insider.

"Stealing from Vivian Hartley? That's like forging Shakespeare's lost plays!" commented a verified author account.

"Never cared for Serena before, but this principled stand? Respect. Plastic surgery fixes faces but integrity's forever," read a viral post.

"Someone identify this fraud! The industry blacklist awaits!" demanded another trending tweet.

Meanwhile, in the shadowy parking garage beneath Dawson Enterprises, a supplier started his car after concluding business. As headlights cut through the gloom, he spotted a figure lurking between concrete pillars.

Natasha Dawson stood there in a microskirt that barely covered her thighs, the neckline of her top plunging dangerously low. Her toned legs gleamed under fluorescent lights. For a fleeting moment, the man thought of Vivian, but Adrian Blackwood's formidable reputation quickly dispelled that fantasy.

He rolled down his window with a greasy smile. "Ms. Dawson! What brings you down here? Need assistance?"

Natasha suppressed a shudder at his leer but forced a coquettish smile. She recognized him from family gatherings.

Leaning into his window, she positioned her cleavage at eye level. "You've visited our estate, haven't you?" she purred. "My accounts got frozen unexpectedly. Could you lend me twenty thousand? Father will reimburse you tonight."

Her fingers trailed along the car door as she waited, the scent of her expensive perfume filling the cramped space. The supplier's gaze dropped to her exposed thighs, his breathing noticeably quickening.

Natasha hid her disgust behind batting eyelashes. Every second of this charade made her skin crawl, but desperate times called for desperate measures. The money would buy her another week's escape from her crumbling life.

Somewhere above them, the city lights twinkled indifferently.
###Chapter 424

The man's gaze slithered over Natasha's figure like a snake, pausing obscenely at her neckline. His lips curled into a predatory grin that made her skin crawl.

"Fifty grand," he drawled, licking his chapped lips. "For one night with me."

His beady eyes nearly disappeared as he laughed—a wet, guttural sound that triggered Natasha's gag reflex. Even at her most desperate, she'd rather starve than touch this repulsive creature.

"Who the hell do you think you are?" Natasha hissed, her manicured nails digging into her palms.

She'd come to the Blackwood Group's parking garage that afternoon, hoping to catch Adrian and Vivian together. Instead, she'd stumbled upon this human-shaped cockroach lurking between the luxury cars.

The memory of Maxwell's blackmail surfaced like bile in her throat. That video of her assault—her darkest hour—used as leverage to make her sabotage Vivian. She despised Maxwell, but her hatred for Vivian burned brighter.

Vivian, who should've been a social pariah, was instead flourishing like some golden princess.

Natasha's plan had been simple: use Maxwell to ruin Vivian, then hand him over to the authorities. But fate had other ideas—Maxwell got arrested before she could even meet him.

The man before her snorted. "Still playing the rich bitch, huh? The Dawsons were always trash pretending to be royalty. Now that your parents sold their pathetic company, you'll be lucky to afford ramen noodles." He gave her a slow, disgusted once-over. "And look at you—used goods. Not even a drunk would pay for this."

He wiped imaginary dust off his sleeve. "Laugh now, sweetheart. Soon you'll be begging for pocket change."

His smirk widened. "Hard to believe you share DNA with Vivian Hartley. She's a fucking angel while you're—"

Natasha's vision went red. "Vivian? An angel?" She let out a shrill laugh. "Look at your face—it's like a train wreck even plastic surgery can't fix. You make Voldemort look handsome!"

The injustice of it all boiled her blood. Why was Vivian always the blessed one? Why did even this walking garbage dare insult her?

Blind with rage, Natasha swung her designer purse like a weapon. The metal clasp sliced across his cheek, drawing blood.

For a heartbeat, he seemed stunned. Then, with terrifying calm, he touched the wound, examined the crimson on his fingers, and licked it clean. The transformation from lecher to predator happened in an instant.

He lunged through the car window, yanking Natasha's hair so hard she saw stars. Before she could scream, he'd bound her wrists with rope from his glove compartment.

"You'll regret this!" Natasha gasped, her bravado cracking. "My parents know I'm here! The police will—"

He backhanded her across the mouth. "Shut up, princess." The rope bit into her flesh as he shoved her into the trunk. "Time for your reality check."
###Chapter 425

The man's laughter was dark and raspy. "Your parents? They practically gave away their company for pennies."

"If they cared about you, why would they abandon you in this parking lot?"

With terrifying ease, he pushed her into the backseat. Before she could scream, a musty cloth silenced her.

Across town at Blackwood Group headquarters, Adrian and Vivian arrived in a sleek black sedan driven by Ethan.

Adrian turned to Vivian, his stern features softening with a rare smile. He pressed a gentle kiss to her forehead. "Don't stay up waiting. Finish your reports and get some sleep. I have a late meeting in Silverpine."

Vivian straightened his tie with practiced elegance. "Not in Crestwood?"

"No," he murmured. "But tomorrow night, dinner. Just us."

His fingers brushed against hers - an unconscious gesture that suddenly felt weighted with meaning. Adrian realized even the smallest moments between them now carried unspoken promises.

"Alright," Vivian replied softly.

After one last squeeze of her hand, Adrian reluctantly exited the car. Vivian watched until he disappeared through the glass doors before settling back into the leather seat.

"Mrs. Blackwood, shall we return to Seabreeze Villa?" Ethan asked, meeting her gaze in the rearview mirror.

Her phone vibrated.

The screen illuminated with two new WhatsApp messages from Julian Montclair. "Vivian, I'm back in Crestwood. Dinner tonight? No excuses this time."

She hesitated. Adrian had mentioned their unexpected familial connection, which now made everything awkward. That childhood crush she'd admired was technically a cousin.

But perhaps this was for the best. Meeting a male friend alone would raise eyebrows, but family? That was perfectly acceptable.

Her fingers flew across the screen. "My treat. Hazelnut Time Coffee Shop - private room on the left." She sent the location pin.

Ethan only saw his employer engrossed in her phone, unaware of the exchange. After a pause, he nodded. "Very well, Mrs. Blackwood."

At the coffee shop, Vivian checked her watch for the third time. An hour had passed with no sign of Julian.

"I'm here. Where are you?" Two unanswered messages glared back from her screen.

The ice in her neglected latte had completely melted.

Outside, twilight painted the streets in deepening shadows.

Still no reply.
###Chapter 426

The phone buzzed in Vivian's hand just as she reached for the door. Julian Montclair's velvet voice flowed through the receiver. "Vivian, could you come down to the precinct?"

Outside the police station, Julian stood waiting in slate-gray athletic wear. His silver-rimmed glasses caught the sunlight, giving him the scholarly charm of a university professor mixed with youthful energy.

His aide couldn't contain his curiosity. "Sir, since you've uncovered Serena Whitmore paid off the housekeeper to frame Ms. Hartley, why not just—"

A glacial shift in Julian's expression cut him off mid-sentence. "I've told you before," his voice dropped to a dangerous whisper, "address me as Mr. Montclair. I'm just an ordinary citizen. That other title doesn't suit me here."

The momentary sharpness vanished as quickly as it appeared, leaving behind his usual gentle demeanor.

"My apologies, Mr. Montclair," the aide stammered, suddenly aware of the cold sweat forming on his back. He swallowed his remaining words.

This was a side of Julian the aide had never witnessed—polished yet lethal. That fleeting glimpse reminded him exactly why Julian had earned his infamous moniker in certain circles.

The aide suppressed a shudder.

What madness had possessed him to question Julian's methods? Had they been anywhere but Northshire's civilized society, such impertinence could have cost him dearly.

"Don't let it happen again," Julian said, his tone freezing the air between them.

A taxi pulled up moments later. Vivian emerged, her hurried steps carrying her toward Julian.

Surprise flickered across her features before concern took over. Her eyes swept over him in quick assessment. Finding him unharmed, some tension left her shoulders. "Julian? What's wrong?"

Noticing her worry, Julian's lips curved into a smile warm as morning sunlight. The transformation was so complete, his aide felt his breath catch.

Watching this display, the aide finally understood the true meaning of an angel's mask. Strangely, it unsettled him more than Adrian Blackwood's infamous icy demeanor ever had.

"Nothing's wrong," Julian assured, closing the distance between them. "I wanted to introduce you to someone." His hand lifted toward her face in a gesture that made her hesitate.

"Who?" Vivian asked, instinctively leaning back to avoid contact.

But Julian merely plucked a stray crimson thread from her shoulder with effortless grace. He examined it briefly before flicking it into a nearby bin.

Heat rushed to Vivian's cheeks. Had she really imagined—? A married woman thinking Julian would—? Outside a police station of all places?

Flustered, she tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear. "Must've picked that up in the cab," she muttered.
###Chapter 427

Vivian gave the cab a quick glance before asking casually, "Mr. Blackwood didn't come with you?"

Julian maintained his easy smile as he shook his head. "No, he's in Silverpine." She knew Adrian and Julian weren't exactly best friends, but the details of their tension remained unclear to her.

"Let's go inside," Julian suggested smoothly. "The officers are waiting for us."

As she followed him, Vivian noticed a cigarette pack protruding slightly from his jacket pocket. She vaguely remembered Julian being anti-smoking - he'd even scolded strangers for lighting up near him in restaurants once.

Curiosity got the better of her. "Julian, when did you start smoking?"

He paused mid-step before retrieving the pack. "Work's been brutal lately," he admitted with a shrug. "Just taking the edge off occasionally. These are mild though - practically herbal." He flipped open the case and held one toward her.

She inhaled lightly, catching an unexpected floral note. "Gardenias?"

A sudden thought struck her. "Wait - aren't you the owner of Crystalpeak Hot Springs? Adrian mentioned it could be a goldmine with proper management. Why work elsewhere when you could focus there? You could even invite influencers for promotion."

Julian's laugh was soft. "Not mine actually. A friend's passion project. He's... in a delicate position and needed my name for anonymity." His expression turned thoughtful. "Profit isn't the goal - he's searching for someone."

Vivian's eyes widened. "Someone? They built an entire resort just to find one person? Is this some witness protection situation? Or..." Her mind raced with cinematic possibilities.

Julian chuckled at her expression. "Always the storyteller. Nothing that dramatic - just reconnecting with an old friend. A resort attracts visitors, increases the chances they'll walk in naturally."

She hesitated. "How did you know I'm a screenwriter?"

"Connections at Ivory Phoenix," he answered smoothly. Given his ties to the Blackwoods, industry contacts weren't surprising. Especially with Damien Vaughn making her credentials public recently.

Vivian decided she was being paranoid.

"You wrote shorts in college," Julian continued conversationally. "Career progression makes sense."

Memories of university flickered through her mind. She rubbed her neck sheepishly. "Those barely counted - just patching together online templates."

Julian's voice warmed. "Every master was once a beginner. You were just a student, but I remember your national award-winning short."
###Chapter 428

The words would have rolled off Vivian's shoulders like water on a duck's back if Julian had spoken them weeks ago. But now, with the revelation of their familial ties hanging between them, his praise landed differently—too gentle, too patronizing, like he was soothing a skittish kitten rather than addressing an equal.

Her mind involuntarily conjured Adrian's image. The man wielded criticism like a surgeon's scalpel, precise and merciless, leaving others emotionally bare. Yet when it came to compliments? He fumbled worse than a penguin attempting ballet.

Julian, by contrast, was like dawn breaking after a hurricane. Where Adrian left destruction in his wake, Julian planted gardens. His optimism was contagious, his perspective always angled toward hope.

Adrian was all thorns and venom, beautiful but dangerous to touch. Julian? He was the hearth in winter—steady, comforting, impossible to resist drawing nearer.

Their conversation carried them to an interrogation room door. An officer approached. "Ms. Hartley?"

Vivian nodded, her attention snagging on the figure inside. There sat the greasy supplier who'd once signed contracts with Dawson Enterprises, now slumped in a metal chair.

"Suspect in a kidnapping case," the officer confirmed.

Julian smoothly interjected, "I spotted him driving erratically, noticed bound limbs in his backseat. Didn't realize it was your stepsister until the police arrived." A deliberate pause. "Though it wouldn't have changed my actions. Justice isn't ours to mete out."

The officer's approving nod was immediate. "Commendable ethics, Mr. Montclair. These days, too many confuse vengeance for justice."

"Lawfulness is my compass," Julian replied, serene as ever.

His assistant, Vincent, bit his tongue hard enough to taste copper. The sheer audacity of Julian—whose hands were far from clean—speaking about lawful conduct without blinking was nothing short of breathtaking. Then again, in Northshire, even wolves wore sheep's clothing when convenient.

Vivian's brows arched. "Natasha's condition?"

"Minor injuries, mostly shock," the officer said. "She's giving her statement separately. We brought you in because this connects to your own abduction. Your cooperation would be invaluable."

"Of course," Vivian agreed.

After providing her account, the officer walked her out, his expression apologetic. "Ms. Hartley, we may lack sufficient evidence to charge Natasha directly."

Vivian's smile held quiet steel. "Karma has its own courts. If she's guilty, justice will find her."

The officer looked impressed. "Admirable perspective. Rest assured, we'll pursue every lead. The innocent won't be punished, nor will the guilty escape."


###Chapter 429

The polite conversation concluded, Vivian and Julian stepped out of the police station. The night had fully descended, wrapping the streets in a quiet, velvety darkness.

Vivian glanced up at the starless sky and sighed. "The Sapphire Café must be closed by now."

Julian pressed his lips together briefly before speaking. "I've made reservations elsewhere. It's my birthday today—so humor me and let me choose?"

His eyes sparkled with quiet amusement, a soft smile playing at the corners of his lips.

There was something in his tone—a faint hesitation—that made Vivian pause. She couldn’t tell if it was genuine or just her imagination running wild.

Mentally counting the days, she cursed herself. She’d bought a gift weeks ago but had forgotten it in the chaos of the day. Handing it over now would feel awkward, so she decided to wait for a better moment.

She offered him a warm smile. "Happy birthday, Julian."

With a playful shrug, she spread her hands. "No gift this time, but I promise I’ll make it up to you."

A flicker of delight crossed Julian’s face as he lightly brushed his fingers over hers. Vivian froze, caught off guard by the unexpected touch.

Just as she tensed, he pretended to tighten his grip before releasing her with a grin. "The best gift is already mine."

Her gaze dropped to her empty palm, the fleeting warmth of his touch lingering like a phantom sensation.

"What gift?" she murmured, her wide, curious eyes lifting to meet his.

The faint confusion on her face only made her more enchanting.

Julian chuckled, his voice low and rich. "Your promise to make it up to me. That’s more than enough."

A sleek silver-gray car pulled up beside them—understated yet exuding quiet luxury.

Julian moved to the passenger side, holding the door open with effortless grace.

Still slightly dazed, Vivian ducked into the seat.

He closed the door behind her and circled the car to take the driver’s seat.

Only then did she realize his assistant wasn’t joining them.

Julian parked near the university, a knowing smile forming on his lips. "Does this place bring back memories?"

"How could I forget?" Vivian’s gaze landed on the familiar two-story building, now renovated with a sleek, modern facade.

It was the Northshire Grill, a beloved barbecue spot run by a couple who had moved here from the coast after their children left home. Known for its fresh ingredients and bold flavors, it had been a student favorite for its affordability.

The nostalgia wrapped around her like an old, comfortable sweater.

Julian’s fingers tapped lightly against the steering wheel. "Shall we?"

She nodded, the past and present blurring together as they stepped into the warmth of the restaurant.
###Chapter 430

The quaint little café had always been their gathering place, etched deeply in the memories of both Vivian and Julian. Stepping inside now, Vivian was hit by a tidal wave of nostalgia, realizing how drastically time had altered everything.

She thought about the luxurious rooftop bar she'd picked earlier and chuckled to herself. Without realizing it, she'd started adopting the habits of high society.

Among her small circle of friends, Julian stood out uniquely. He'd been her most genuine friend in college, now her guardian angel, and in many ways, her chosen family.

There was an unshakable feeling that in exchange for her authenticity, she'd gained a refined social grace she never asked for.

"This place has gotten so popular," Julian remarked with an amused smile as he unbuckled his seatbelt. "Had to reserve our spot twenty-four hours in advance."

As Vivian stepped out of the car, her heel caught on uneven pavement. Julian's arm shot out instinctively, and suddenly she found herself leaning against his solid frame.

True to his gentlemanly nature, he steadied her briefly before immediately releasing her. "Careful there," he murmured softly.

He walked over to a nearby tree, tying a bright orange caution ribbon around a low-hanging branch to mark the hazard.

Vivian's gaze fell on the displaced metal cover that had created the dangerous gap in the walkway.

"Shouldn't we just put the cover back?" she suggested offhandedly.

Julian wiped his hands with a sanitizing wipe before responding, "That thing weighs a ton."

"It's not some playground equipment kids can move around. Those handles indicate it's an access point - probably for utility workers. If someone's down there working, replacing it could trap them."

Vivian smiled warmly at him. "You always think of everything, Julian."

Adrian was thorough to a fault, perhaps even more meticulous than Vivian, but he never bothered explaining things with Julian's patient consideration. The contrast in their personalities never ceased to amaze her.

Vivian had always been drawn to kindhearted people. She adored those selfless second leads in romantic dramas, yet somehow she'd fallen for someone aloof and proud.

Not fifty yards away, inside a discreetly parked van, Serena swiped through a series of candid photos on her phone, a cold smirk playing on her lips.

First it was Damien, then Sebastian, and now this new man. Vivian seemed to collect male companions like trophies.

Adrian might tolerate one or two men orbiting his woman, but how long before his pride snapped? A man of his stature wouldn't endure being upstaged indefinitely.

After a moment's consideration, Serena composed a WhatsApp message to Adrian: "Are you with Ms. Hartley right now? Just saw someone who looked exactly like her."

She carefully selected the most compromising photos from her collection and attached them.

Anticipating the explosive confrontation between Adrian and Vivian sent a thrill down Serena's spine.
###Chapter 431

Miranda watched Serena's intense focus on her phone with growing concern. After a moment's hesitation, she spoke up. "You might want to reconsider provoking Mr. Blackwood. Pushing him too far could backfire."

"What are you implying?" Serena snapped, tossing her phone onto the seat beside her. "The truth is the truth. Vivian is the one who's careless, not me. I just exposed her. How is that my fault?"

Miranda stayed silent, though she couldn't shake the feeling that Serena was throwing away a golden opportunity.

At Silverpine Airport, Adrian stepped off the plane and checked his messages. Vivian's chat remained silent, but Ethan had sent an update: "Mrs. Blackwood went to meet a friend at Hazelnut Time Coffee Shop."

Just as he was about to close the app, a flurry of notifications from Serena lit up his screen. He hesitated, then ignored them and locked his phone.

Inside her limo, Serena stared at her screen, waiting for a response. Before, Adrian would reply instantly, no matter how busy he was. The lack of a typing indicator made her stomach twist.

Her fingers flew across the screen. "Vivian has a history of trouble. I didn’t want to say anything, but I thought you should know. I’d never forgive myself if something happened to her again."

Adrian had just stepped into the crowded terminal when the message came through. He opened it, scanning the text before tapping on the attached photos.

The images were grainy—taken from a distance in poor lighting—but Vivian’s outfit matched what she’d been wearing earlier.

He was about to reply with a curt "Noted" when another message popped up.

"Adrian, don’t worry too much. It’s near the university, so it’s probably safe, right?"

His fingers moved swiftly. "That’s not her."

Serena’s grip on her phone tightened. Even blurry, Vivian was unmistakable. Adrian was lying to protect her. The realization burned—his devotion ran deeper than she’d ever imagined.

Adrian dialed Ethan. "Who is Vivian meeting? Damien?" He remembered the last time he’d seen her at that café, sitting across from Damien Vaughn.

"I’m not sure. When I dropped her off, the other person hadn’t arrived yet." Ethan’s voice wavered slightly, sensing the tension. "I’ll find out immediately."

Adrian hung up and texted Vivian. "Where are you?"

Vivian, meanwhile, was too absorbed in grilling slices of wagyu to notice her phone. The meat sizzled, juices dripping onto the hot plate. She wrapped a perfectly seared piece in lettuce, dabbed it with sauce, and popped it into her mouth.

After a long day, the rich, savory flavor made her sigh in contentment.
###Chapter 432

Vivian glanced up from her plate to find Julian watching her with an amused expression. He casually rolled up his sleeves, revealing well-toned forearms, before expertly wrapping a lettuce leaf around a slice of grilled beef and placing it on her plate.

"That's unnecessary," Vivian said, pushing the offering aside with her fork. "I'm perfectly capable of feeding myself, Julian."

Across town, Adrian's fingers hovered over his phone screen. When no reply came, he pressed call with more force than necessary.

The sudden vibration startled Vivian. She swallowed her bite of kimchi pancake hastily. "Adrian? I thought you were in Silverpine?"

His voice crackled through the line, icy and clipped. "Last I checked, Silverpine wasn't on another planet. Am I not allowed to call my fiancée?"

Vivian's grip tightened on her phone. This mood swing was becoming tiresome. Just this morning he'd been affectionate, now he was back to his usual controlling self.

"You could call from the moon for all I care," she retorted, keeping her voice level.

The silence stretched between them like taffy.

Adrian exhaled sharply through his nose. "Where exactly are you?" The question came out strained, as though pulled from him against his will.

"Near campus," Vivian answered, twirling her chopsticks absently.

"That's odd," Adrian's voice dripped with suspicion. "Your text said you were going to Hazelnut Time."

Vivian's eyes flicked to Julian, then away. She stood abruptly, motioning for a moment's privacy as she stepped toward the restaurant's bamboo-lined hallway.

When she reached a quiet alcove, her voice dropped to a whisper. "Are you having me followed?"

"Should I be?" Adrian shot back. "Who are you with that's got you so defensive?"

Vivian pinched the bridge of her nose. "Fine. It's Julian's birthday. We were headed to Hazelnut Time when we witnessed Natasha being abducted. We reported it to the police, gave statements, and now we're having dinner. Satisfied?" She couldn't resist adding, "Or should I send you photographic evidence, Mr. Blackwood? Maybe have Ethan verify my alibi with traffic cameras?"

The line went quiet as Adrian processed this. His tone softened marginally when he spoke again. "From now on, text me your location when you're with Julian. I'll arrange for Ethan to escort you."

Vivian's fingers clenched around her phone. "Adrian, I understand your family dynamics are... complicated. But Julian is my friend - and my rescuer. I know my boundaries. I'd appreciate it if you'd respect my right to choose my own company."

Adrian's laugh was bitter. "Boundaries? Is that what you call clinging to him in public? He's technically your nephew-by-marriage, Vivian. You might not care about appearances, but must you be so reckless?"

Vivian froze. Someone had seen her stumble earlier and reported it to Adrian. The realization hit like a bucket of ice water - whether by coincidence or design, he was monitoring her movements. His lack of trust cut deeper than his cruel words.
###Chapter 433

This wasn't merely a disagreement—it struck at the very core of her being, a brutal assault on her integrity and heart. Yet the divorce discussion had faded into the background, and raising it repeatedly would only make her appear irrational.

After a measured silence, her voice cut through like winter frost. "First, if you have concerns, address them to my face."

"I don't play games, Adrian. A marriage without trust is a house built on sand. I trusted you implicitly when you rushed Serena to the hospital—no questions asked. That's the foundation I expect in return." Her breath hitched. "Secondly, as your wife—the woman who vowed to stand by you—I deserve better than careless words that cut deeper than any knife."

Adrian reeled as if struck. Vivian's raw honesty disarmed him completely, not the defensive outburst he'd anticipated. Guilt twisted his features as he mumbled, "Last fight, you said far worse—"

"So my mistakes justify yours?" Vivian's calm sliced through his excuse. "Is this our future? Trading wounds until we're both bleeding out? What's the endgame here?"

The phone line hummed with heavy silence.

When Adrian remained mute, Vivian's tone turned glacial. "Since you have nothing constructive to add, I'm ending this. My dinner's getting cold."

"Wait." His voice cracked with uncharacteristic vulnerability. "I... apologize. There are circumstances you're unaware of—I only acted out of concern."

Vivian refused to indulge his cryptic hints. "An apology without changed behavior is just manipulation. If you truly care, prove it through actions, not words that leave scars."

She terminated the call and spun around—only to freeze. Julian stood three paces behind her, his presence as silent as snowfall.

"Didn't mean to intrude." He stepped forward, hands raised in peaceful surrender. "Wanted to ensure you weren't needing anything."

Vivian trusted Julian implicitly—his discretion was absolute. "Nothing important," she dismissed with a fragile smile, relieved he hadn't heard Adrian's accusations. That humiliation would've been unbearable.

Julian's gaze softened. "Misunderstanding with your husband? Shall I clarify—"

"No need." Vivian brushed past him toward their table. "I mentioned celebrating your birthday. That's all."

A peculiar tension gripped Julian's shoulders. His smile faltered into something wistful. "You... knew?"

"Pardon?" Vivian blinked before realization dawned. "Oh. Adrian mentioned your familial connection."

Julian trailed her back to their seats. "Our families severed ties decades ago," he murmured, staring at his wineglass. "We're little more than strangers now."

Vivian focused on flipping the sizzling meat, the comfortable rhythm of their usual banter disrupted. University days had never known this strained silence—back then, their conversations flowed like rivers, effortlessly filling every pause.

Now, the quiet between them felt charged with unspoken truths.
###Chapter 434

Vivian's tongs hovered over the sizzling beef for what seemed like an eternity when Julian's utensil suddenly slid beneath hers, deftly rescuing the meat from the flames.

She lifted her gaze to meet his, confusion etching lines between her brows.

A wry smile touched Julian's lips. "Charcoal isn't on tonight's menu."

Vivian's teeth sank into her lower lip, her silence louder than words.

Adrian's untimely phone call had shattered their peaceful evening like a stone through stained glass.

Without preamble, Julian's voice sliced through the thick air between them. "Are you certain he's the one you want?"

The bluntness of his question caught Vivian off guard. For several heartbeats, she couldn't decipher his true meaning. But deception had never been her way with Julian.

After a measured pause, she answered, "We've built two years together. There's history between us—"

"History shouldn't mean tolerating disrespect. If he trusted you, that scene earlier wouldn't have happened. I know your heart better than most."

The usually composed Julian had turned razor-sharp. His words, though clinically accurate, pressed against Vivian's chest like an anvil, stealing her breath.

She recoiled from discussing her marriage's fractures with anyone. Love blurred objectivity—both bore scars, neither was wholly innocent.

Vivian shrugged with practiced nonchalance. "I'm no saint either, Julian. You've only seen my best face. That coldness of his? Just armor over a tender heart. The real tragedy is he never learned how to love properly."

Julian's eyes darkened with disbelief. "You're rewriting reality to justify him."

A slow headshake. "Not justification. Perspective. You see this as an outsider while I'm in the arena." Her fingers twisted the napkin in her lap. "We're cut from the same cloth, Adrian and I. Different upbringings shape how we love—sometimes badly. Ask me as his wife, and I'd tell you he's a good man." She met his gaze squarely. "You're dear to me, Julian. But whether as my oldest friend or his associate, this conversation crosses lines."

Her typically animated features had gone solemn, the unfamiliar formality making Julian shift uncomfortably. He'd known her longer than Adrian had—this tension between them felt wrong.

Julian's expression softened, his voice dropping to a murmur. "I overstepped."

The silence that followed was thick with unsaid words, neither knowing how to mend the rift.

Sensing Vivian's discomfort, Julian didn't press further. Instead, he quietly replenished her plate with perfectly grilled morsels, letting the quiet stretch between them like twilight shadows.

The barbecue's smoke curled upward, carrying with it the scent of something precious burning away.
###Chapter 435

The dinner unfolded in an electric silence, punctuated only by the occasional crackle from the grill between them. Each sound felt like a carefully choreographed movement in their unspoken dance.

As Adrian pulled up to Seabreeze Villa, Vivian's breath caught. Golden light spilled from the windows of her home, an unexpected sight that sent her pulse racing.

She mentally retraced her steps. She'd left in broad daylight—there was no way she'd forgotten to turn off the lights. The gated community's tight security ruled out intruders, yet the mystery remained.

Then the front door swung open, revealing a familiar broad-shouldered silhouette that instantly solved the puzzle.

Adrian leaned against the doorframe, a shopping bag dangling from his fingers. His usually impeccable suit showed signs of travel, the first two buttons of his shirt undone.

"Welcome home," he murmured as Vivian stepped out of Julian's car, his gaze flickering between them.

Vivian barely had time to thank Julian before Adrian's arm claimed her shoulders with possessive ease. In one fluid motion, he extended the bag toward Julian.

Only then did Vivian recognize the distinctive Sterling & Co logo—the very fountain pen they'd selected together days earlier.

Julian's fingers twitched but didn't reach for the offering.

"Please take it," Vivian urged, her voice softer than intended. "When I saw it, I immediately thought of you. Consider it an early birthday gift."

The words tasted like ash. She hadn't known today was his birthday until their dinner conversation, and the realization now made her skin prickle with discomfort.

After a beat, Julian accepted the package, his eyes holding hers with quiet intensity. "Thank you," he said, the words weighted with unspoken meaning.

Adrian's grip tightened imperceptibly. "Now that my wife's safely home and you've got your present, I believe we're done here." He steered Vivian toward the house with unmistakable finality.

Vivian threw Julian an apologetic glance over her shoulder. "It's late. You should—"

"Really, darling," Adrian cut in, his breath warm against her ear as he pulled her closer, "must we drag this out?"

Julian watched them disappear inside, their effortless intimacy a stark contrast to the explosive argument he'd witnessed mere hours earlier. He'd expected days of tension, not this seamless reconciliation.

Back in his car, Julian flicked on the dome light. The white fountain pen gleamed in its velvet nest—elegant, pristine, untouched. Just like the version of himself he'd always shown Vivian.

If only he'd known she preferred storms to still waters, he might have let her see the tempest beneath his calm surface. The realization settled like lead in his chest as he started the engine.
###Chapter 436

The fleeting thought vanished as quickly as it came. Adrian gave a slight shake of his head. Someone like Vivian belonged in her pristine world, a gilded cage that should never be disturbed.

He snapped the pen case shut and sped into the night, the darkness consuming his car whole.

Meanwhile, Vivian followed Adrian into the living quarters. The moment the door clicked shut, she withdrew her hand from his grasp and took two deliberate steps back.

Her voice carried winter's chill. "What brings you back?"

"I came because I wanted to." Adrian recaptured her wrist, guiding her toward the plush sofa. He sat first, then pulled her onto his lap effortlessly. His hands slipped beneath her blouse, fingertips tracing lazy circles along her waistline.

The hours melted away, her earlier fury dissipating like morning mist.

Vivian broke the silence casually. "Did you sign those documents?"

Adrian merely shrugged. "Left it to my associates." He nuzzled her shoulder, amusement coloring his tone. "My wife nearly eloped with another man. You think I'd care about paperwork?"

Her expression turned glacial. "Even if I ran," she said with razor-sharp sarcasm, "it wouldn't be with your cousin. That's not my taste. If all men vanished tomorrow, I'd still avoid every Blackwood."

Adrian pinched her side playfully. "Still holding a grudge?" His chuckle vibrated against her skin. "The jet was shaking, I'd been drafting contracts for hours, my mind was elsewhere. Didn't mean anything by it."

Seeing his concession, Vivian relented. With a smirk, she countered, "If Mr. Blackwood can't control his tongue, perhaps he should donate it to medical science."

"I'll donate it to you," Adrian murmured, his voice dropping an octave. Cradling the back of her head, he claimed her lips in a searing kiss that left them both breathless.

The contact only stoked his hunger. He lifted her effortlessly, grinning. "Perhaps there's something else I'd rather give you... say, a daughter?"

Vivian mock-punched his shoulder. "Why not a son?"

"Either would be perfection." His obsidian eyes burned with devotion. "I'll cherish whatever gift you give me."

Adrian carried her into the bedroom, laying her gently upon the silk sheets. Vivian suddenly sat upright, wrinkling her nose. "I smell like barbecue." She pushed against his chest. "I need to shower."

Overcome with desire, Adrian caught her wrist. "The smoke doesn't bother me."

Vivian arched an eyebrow, mischief dancing in her eyes. "Well it bothers me." She flashed a wicked grin. "But I'll make it worth your wait."

Adrian's gaze darkened with promise as he released her. "No tricks, little liar."

"Scout's honor," Vivian vowed, already locking the bathroom door behind her.

###Chapter 437

The click of the lock made Adrian smirk. Vivian's attempt to protect her modesty was adorable. If she hadn't secured that door, he might have struggled not to follow her in.

He straightened his posture, pulling out his phone to distract himself with work emails. The tension that had been coiling in his muscles gradually dissipated.

Control was everything to Adrian. He'd always believed true strength lay in mastering one's impulses, not surrendering to them.

Meanwhile, Vivian emerged from the shower, towel-drying her hair before retrieving a hidden package from her dresser.

It was lingerie she'd purchased during a shopping spree with Audrey. The opaque packaging had concealed its true nature - she'd only glimpsed lace and what appeared to be cotton trim, imagining something sweet and innocent.

Her breath caught when she unfolded it. The "cotton" turned out to be mere decorative accents on an otherwise scandalously sheer ensemble.

The bralette offered minimal coverage with two petite heart-shaped patches, while the bottoms were barely there, connected by delicate ribbons. The effect was simultaneously revealing and tantalizing.

Heat flooded her cheeks as she contemplated wearing it. After a brief internal debate, she secured her robe tightly and ventured out.

Adrian glanced up immediately, taking in her bundled appearance. His eyebrow arched in mock disapproval. "This is the surprise you promised?"

Truthfully, he hadn't expected anything, so disappointment wasn't his primary emotion. Setting his phone aside, he approached with deliberate steps, his voice dropping to a husky murmur. "Someone's being a tease."

Before she could respond, he closed the distance between them. With practiced ease, he untied her robe's belt, letting the fabric cascade open.

The sight stole his breath. Suddenly, he understood the purpose of such intimate apparel perfectly.

Vivian's natural beauty was undeniable, but the barely-there lingerie elevated her allure to breathtaking levels. The delicate fabric accentuated her curves while strategically placed lace hinted at what lay beneath.

The contrast between her usual poised elegance and this daring display was intoxicating. His fingers traced the satin ribbon at her waist, his gaze darkening. "You were made to wear this."

"We should get you more sets like this."

Knowing exactly where to touch, he had her trembling within moments. When her knees buckled, she instinctively clung to his shoulders. Amused, he gave her a light swat before sweeping her into his arms.

As he laid her on the bed, her eyes had already glazed with desire. Any remaining restraint evaporated as Adrian lost himself in her responsiveness, every touch drawing delicious reactions.

###Chapter 438

The fire between them burned long into the night, their connection growing more intense with each passing moment. Only when Vivian's broken whispers pierced through - her voice raw, her lashes damp with unshed tears - did Adrian finally ease his relentless pace.

Shifting to lie beside her, Adrian watched as Vivian pulled the silk sheets up to her chin, burying her flushed face in the pillow. Within minutes, her breathing steadied into the deep rhythm of exhausted sleep.

Adrian's gaze traveled downward, catching sight of her slender legs peeking from beneath the covers, still bearing the faint pink imprints of his passion. A possessive thrill shot through him, like an artist surveying his finest work.

With careful fingers, he adjusted the duvet to shield her completely from the morning chill.

As dawn's first light crept through the windows, Adrian propped himself against the headboard, lighting a cigarette before reaching for his phone. A text from Dominic blinked on the screen - an invitation for drinks sent hours earlier.

It struck him how completely Vivian had consumed his world lately. When was the last time he'd simply gone out with the guys?

Yet even as he acknowledged this change, Adrian found he didn't miss the endless social rounds. His life felt richer now, more purposeful. His attention drifted to Vivian's sleeping form beside him, her delicate features barely visible above the cocoon of blankets.

Unable to resist, he reached out to brush a fingertip along the slope of her nose.

She twitched in her sleep, a tiny frown creasing her brow before she turned her face deeper into the pillow like a kitten seeking shelter. The sight tugged at something primal in his chest.

Decision made, Adrian stubbed out his cigarette and set his phone aside. Sliding beneath the covers, he gathered Vivian's warm body against his, breathing in her familiar scent as sleep claimed him.

The shrill alarm tore Vivian from dreams the next morning. Blinking against the dim light, she nearly drifted back to sleep until the clock's numbers registered - noon.

She bolted upright, sheets pooling around her waist as she took in Adrian working on his laptop across the room. Only then did she notice the blackout drapes keeping the room in artificial twilight.

"Finally awake?" Adrian's deep voice sent shivers down her spine as he reached for the remote. The curtains parted like stage curtains, sunlight flooding in to gild his aristocratic features.

Vivian scrambled from bed, suddenly aware of the marks still visible on her skin. She could feel Adrian's heated gaze tracing every movement.

Noticing her discomfort, Adrian's lips curved. "What's there to hide? I know every inch of you."

"Hide? Please," Vivian tossed her hair, affecting nonchalance despite her burning cheeks. "With this body, I should be modeling lingerie." She made a show of searching for her discarded pajamas.
###Chapter 439

The morning light filtered through the sheer curtains as Vivian stretched lazily in Adrian's king-sized bed. Her fingers brushed against the empty space beside her before she finally sat up, the silk sheets pooling around her waist.

After a quick glance around the room, her eyes landed on Adrian's crisp white dress shirt hanging neatly over the armchair. She slipped into it effortlessly, the soft fabric skimming her thighs in a way that made her feel both comfortable and alluring.

Adrian's arms encircled her waist from behind before she could take another step. His warm breath tickled her neck as he leaned in for a kiss.

Vivian turned her face at the last second.

His lips grazed her cheek instead.

"Morning breath," she said with a wrinkle of her nose, effectively ruining the romantic moment.

Adrian's grip loosened as he chuckled. His fingers found the sensitive spot at her waist, giving it a playful pinch. "Tell me again why my wife needs to model lingerie for half of Crestwood to see?"

"It's a charity runway show," Vivian corrected, swatting his hand away. "Not your personal peep show."

Adrian's lips found the shell of her ear, his voice dropping to that possessive growl she knew too well. "Every inch of you belongs to me."

Vivian twisted out of his grasp with practiced ease, making her way toward the ensuite bathroom. At the threshold, she paused just long enough to throw him a smirk over her shoulder. "Then you'd better start proving why I shouldn't share the view."

The bathroom door clicked shut before Adrian could respond.

Shaking his head at her antics, Adrian returned to the living area where his laptop still sat open on the coffee table. He reached for his phone to text Ethan about lunch delivery - no chance of cooking today with his workload.

His phone buzzed again before he could set it down.

Dominic's name flashed across the screen.

Adrian expected another invitation to Mirage Lounge or some new restaurant Dominic had discovered. Instead, the message read: "Blackwood, you seen my latest IG story?"

Before Adrian could dismiss it, another notification came through - a screenshot of what appeared to be an elaborate bouquet. Followed by Dominic's signature taunt: "Tell me your wife has ever given you anything half as thoughtful in your entire marriage."

Curiosity getting the better of him, Adrian opened the image.

The arrangement was unlike anything he'd seen before - ninety-nine black roses interspersed with what appeared to be... cigarette packs? Upon closer inspection, he recognized Dominic's current obsession: the limited edition 1918 Mint Rose cigarettes that cost a small fortune.

Each pack had been meticulously arranged to resemble flowers, creating a striking contrast with the dark roses. The whole display must have cost thousands. It was extravagant, ridiculous, and exactly the kind of over-the-top gesture Dominic would make.

Adrian's lips twitched as he studied the photo. Challenge accepted.
###Chapter 440

Adrian Blackwood remembered that Dominic Sinclair's girlfriend wasn't some spoiled heiress. She'd built her own fashion label from scratch, and this luxury watch she'd gifted him must have cost her months of earnings.

His thoughts drifted to Vivian Hartley. Despite her recent success with both acting and scriptwriting projects, she'd never bothered to get him anything meaningful. Julian Montclair's grand gestures still occupied her thoughts, while his own efforts went unnoticed.

The sight of that ridiculous green frog plushie in the bedroom corner made his jaw tighten. With deliberate calm, he typed: "That watch will outlast your relationship. Enjoy it while you can."

Gift or no gift, he wasn't about to let Dominic have the last word.

His phone lit up instantly with Dominic's call. Adrian declined without hesitation. He could already hear the whiny excuses about "true love" and "meaningful connections."

Fingers flying across the screen, he sent another message: "Public displays of affection are just compensation for private insecurities."

The moment it sent, he grimaced. Coming from him, that was rich.

Dominic's reply came fast: "Spoken like someone who's never been properly loved. Maybe if you'd shown Vivian how you felt—"

"Fuck off," Adrian typed, cutting him off mid-sentence.

A barrage of voice messages followed. When Adrian predictably ignored them, Dominic switched to text: "You're just bitter. Being with Audrey makes me feel alive in ways I never imagined. If I could spend eternity wrapped in her embrace, I'd die a happy man."

Adrian's lip curled in disgust as he blocked the number, then wiped his hands with a sanitizing cloth as if scrubbing away the conversation.

Opening his laptop, he tried focusing on work emails. But his mind kept circling back—had Vivian ever given him anything? She maintained their penthouse flawlessly, anticipated his every need... but actual gifts?

His wardrobe was perpetually stocked by personal shoppers from Opal Galleria. That time he'd shown interest in a limited-edition tie at Emerald Pizzeria, she'd said, "You have three dozen untouched ties at home. Let's find you something you'll actually wear."

Yet whenever he traveled, he always returned with something special for her—that sapphire necklace from Sapphire Springs, the antique script from Sterling & Co's rare books collection...

The double standard stung more than he cared to admit.
###Chapter 441

Adrian had everything a man could desire, yet the absence of spontaneous gestures from his wife gnawed at him.

The thought festered in his mind like an unscratchable itch.

Vivian emerged from the ensuite in oversized pajamas that swallowed her frame, damp curls escaping her towel turban. The sight inexplicably irritated him further.

"Have you ever considered giving me presents?" The question tumbled out sharper than intended.

Vivian blinked, squeezing water from her hair. "What sort of presents?"

"Any." Adrian crossed his arms. "Surprise ones."

Her fingers stilled in her dark tresses. "I have," she countered automatically.

Moonlight caught the blue-black sheen of her hair as it cascaded over her shoulders. Adrian's breath hitched - she looked like a watercolor painting come to life.

The tension in his shoulders dissolved as realization dawned. He schooled his features into neutrality, though mischief danced in his gaze. "Don't tell me you're the gift?"

Vivian rolled her eyes so hard it nearly hurt. "Are we in some low-budget rom-com now? A genius with a 140 IQ spouting clichés? Should I check you for fever?"

She snatched the emerald frog plush from the nightstand and lobbed it at him. "There. Your gift."

Adrian caught it one-handed, then extended his palm. "The pen."

"What pen?" Vivian tilted her head.

"The free one you got when buying Julian's birthday present." His jaw tightened. "The one I refused."

"You specifically said—"

"I changed my mind." His tone brooked no argument.

Vivian crossed her arms. "I need it for script notes."

Adrian considered this. "Fine. I'll buy you that limited edition Sterling & Co fountain pen in exchange."

Her lips twitched. With their reconciliation, spending millions on writing tools seemed absurd. A slow smile spread across her face that made Adrian instantly wary.

She perched on the bed, fingers brushing his forearm. "Counteroffer - you buy me an equivalent pen..." Her voice turned saccharine. "And give me the remaining nine million in cash."

Adrian's mouth opened, then snapped shut.

The silence stretched between them, thick with unspoken negotiations.
###Chapter 442

Adrian paused, captivated by the radiant smile lighting up Vivian's face.

His voice dropped to a murmur. "Care to explain why you want it in cash?"

Vivian blinked her doe eyes innocently. "It's straightforward. You're investing ten million in me—whether through a pen or cash makes no difference. The value remains identical, doesn't it?"

Studying her intently, Adrian's lips curved. "Is this really you, Vivian? Or has some money-hungry imposter taken over? Just months ago, you scoffed at wealth, dreaming of abandoning material possessions. Now you're haggling over a pen's worth."

He leaned closer, amusement dancing in his eyes. "Has reality finally taught you that even romance needs financial backing?"

Vivian squared her shoulders. "Haggling? How crude. I've simply realized something—you're being deliberately difficult. Earning money is challenging, but managing it? That's an art. This isn't just your money anymore—it's ours. While I may not contribute equally financially, I'm investing my effort in managing it. Doesn't that count for something?"

Without missing a beat, Adrian whipped out his phone. His fingers flew across the screen as he transferred the funds. "Twenty million. Buy whatever pen your heart desires. Now hand it over."

Vivian rose gracefully, retrieving the sleek pen box from the nightstand. She placed it in his palm with deliberate care.

Adrian examined the pen, testing its weight. He struck several poses—fingers curled around the barrel, pretending to write—snapping photos until satisfied. Opening WhatsApp, he frowned at the missing chat. Right—he'd blocked Dominic earlier.

After unblocking him, Adrian sent the chosen photo with a caption: "My wife's latest gift."

"Received so many presents I've grown numb to showing off. This one's worth a hundred grand—could buy several of your pathetic flower arrangements, no?"

Dominic's screen flooded with previously undelivered messages marked by angry red exclamation points. Just as irritation spiked, Adrian's latest message popped up.

His eyebrows shot up. Was this some childish competition?

Fingers flying, he responded: "Gifts aren't about price tags but thoughtfulness. Mine clearly held deeper meaning."

Adrian smirked, recalling an internet meme. He typed: "No money, no honey."

Dominic stared at his screen, momentarily speechless. Never had he imagined Adrian—for whom wealth was mere numbers—would spout such a clichéd line.

He conceded with a laughing-crying emoji: "Fine, you win this round."

Adrian's eyebrow arched in triumph.

After dinner, Adrian departed for his office while Vivian headed to the studio set.

Upon arrival, she spotted a crowd gathered around Damien Vaughn, engaged in animated discussion. Noticing her, Damien broke away with a welcoming smile.
###Chapter 443

"Earlier, you mentioned abandoning 'Spotlight Night,' and I've been searching for the perfect opportunity to unveil your pen name, Vivian Hartley, to the public. But who could have predicted such a chance would appear so abruptly?"

Damien Vaughn's words made Vivian Hartley pause mid-step. She tilted her head, curiosity flickering in her eyes. "What do you mean?"

A knowing smirk played on his lips as he gestured toward his phone. "Check Instagram."

The moment he said "Instagram," Vivian groaned. "Please don't tell me I'm trending again?"

Sebastian Hartwell, who had just exited the makeup trailer, overheard and let out an amused chuckle. "Vivian, you were born for this industry. I've been in the business for over a decade, and I've never trended half as much as you—and every time, it's a full-blown scandal."

A realization struck her. "This isn't about that plagiarism accusation, is it? I recently took on a new script under a different name, and halfway through, someone claimed I copied Vivian Hartley's work. Before I could even respond, I got blocked."

Damien simply nodded in confirmation.

Sebastian leaned in, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "Do you know who bought that script?"

Vivian shook her head. "I didn’t bother looking into it."

Damien’s lips curved. "It was Serena Whitmore."

At the mention of Serena, memories of past schemes from the production company resurfaced, pieces clicking into place.

Vivian pulled out her phone, which had been silenced on "Do Not Disturb." She hadn’t checked Instagram in hours, and when she finally opened the app, notifications flooded in like a tidal wave. It took her nearly five minutes just to navigate to the main feed.

The headline dominating the platform read: "Vivian Hartley Plagiarism Scandal."

Both Serena’s and Vivian’s fans were locked in a brutal online war. Given the gravity of plagiarism accusations, even neutral bystanders were joining in, skewing the backlash overwhelmingly against her.

Gossip accounts spun tales of Serena purchasing a script, only to discover it was stolen from Vivian Hartley. The real shock? The alleged plagiarist was none other than a rising starlet who had been making waves on social media. Though they didn’t name Vivian outright, the clues were glaring—a female lead with a last name starting with "H," a rising actress moonlighting as a screenwriter, who had supposedly copied the legendary Vivian Hartley.

The breadcrumbs led straight to her.

Vivian skimmed through the vitriolic comments before locking her phone with a sigh. She turned to Damien, her voice steady. "Should I clarify things from Vivian Hartley’s official account?"

She hadn’t expected Serena to be the buyer. Life had a way of being stranger than fiction. Maybe in another universe, it wasn’t Adrian Blackwood she was entangled with, but Serena.

Damien met her gaze. "Let’s wait and see how this unfolds."

Sebastian smirked, leaning in. "Business is business, right? Mr. Vaughn here is just cutting down on PR expenses."
###Chapter 444

Vivian pulled up a chair and sat down with a careless shrug. "You know what they say - all press is good press."

Within hours, Serena took to Instagram, posting: "I've always admired Ms. Hartley's creative genius. I must take partial responsibility for this unfortunate misunderstanding, as I failed to clarify my intentions properly. When I told Ivory Phoenix Productions how much I loved Ms. Hartley's unique style, the screenwriter misinterpreted my words. Rest assured, this project will be shelved immediately. Please show compassion to the writer - online harassment helps no one."

She concluded with: "Originality should always be celebrated in our industry."

The statement was a masterclass in damage control. While appearing to defend the writer, she'd essentially confirmed the plagiarism. Vivian wasn't worried about the social media storm; she doubted even Serena had anticipated this level of backlash. But with Serena involved now, she wondered how Adrian would navigate the situation.

Vivian lowered her lashes, concealing her unease. She knew Adrian's usual approach would be vague neutrality. Serena had always been his blind spot. Without meaning to, Vivian thought of Julian. If she treated Julian with the same leniency Adrian showed Serena, how would he react? The thought barely formed before she dismissed it, reminding herself Julian didn't deserve such comparisons.

After some light banter, filming resumed. With most key scenes completed, the atmosphere was relaxed. For lunch, the catering served crispy fried mackerel - allegedly caught by Damien himself at dawn. Vivian, a seafood enthusiast, eagerly reached for a piece. But as she brought it near her lips, an overpowering fish odor assaulted her senses. Was this really fresh? The pungency made her recoil.

She pinched her nose but forced down a bite. The moment she swallowed, bile rose in her throat. She dropped her fork and bolted for the nearest trash can, retching violently. The crew immediately abandoned their meals, rushing to her side.

"Vivian! Are you okay?"

Sebastian handed her a water bottle. After rinsing her mouth, Vivian waved weakly. "I'm fine. Probably just got a bad piece that wasn't cleaned properly."

Another cast member sampled the fish. "Tastes perfectly fine to me."

"Actually quite delicious," someone else added.

Remembering her sleepless night, Vivian offered, "Must be exhaustion messing with my stomach. I'll skip lunch." No one questioned further, murmuring sympathetic advice: "Don't overwork yourself. Writing and directing are separate beasts."

Damien, in his characteristic authoritative tone, casually remarked, "If you ever need quick funding, just name your next script. I'll advance sixty percent with a year's deadline. Don't waste your talent on problematic projects. True creativity needs inspiration, not commercial drudgery."

Vivian nodded. "Understood. Thank you, Mr. Vaughn."

Damien waved dismissively. "No thanks necessary. Your scripts are blue-chip investments. If anyone should be grateful, it's me for the privilege of working with you."

Their exchange concluded with mutual understanding, the matter settled between professionals.
###Chapter 445

The filming wrapped up early when Vivian Hartley started feeling unwell. The set happened to be close to the Thornton family estate. As Vivian stepped out to hail a cab, she collided with Bianca Thornton, who was giggling drunkenly with her entourage. Bianca's flushed cheeks and glassy eyes betrayed her intoxicated state.

Spotting Vivian, Bianca staggered slightly before freezing mid-step. With a contemptuous sneer, she slurred, "You're pathetic! First plagiarizing scripts, then stealing from Vivian Hartley? How did Adrian ever marry trash like you? You're nothing but bad news!"

The surrounding socialites immediately recognized Vivian as Adrian Blackwood's wife. Though not from elite families themselves, they came from circles far more privileged than the Dawsons. Envious of Vivian's marriage into the Blackwood dynasty, they seized the opportunity to mock her.

"That Cinderella act won't erase your tacky roots. Still scrambling for every penny?"

"Her only redeeming quality is that mediocre face."

A platinum blonde stepped forward, voice dripping with venom. "New money girls must be experts at pleasing men in bed. Though I heard Mr. Blackwood has particular tastes - prefers his women clean. Guess that explains why he keeps you around like some glorified pet."

Their cruel laughter echoed through the plaza - until a sharp slap silenced them all. The blonde clutched her rapidly reddening cheek, shock rendering her speechless.

"How dare you!" she finally shrieked, lunging at Vivian. But Vivian, taller than most present, easily caught her wrist mid-swing. Turning her icy gaze to Bianca, she said calmly, "Control your rabid friend, or shall I call Adrian about this harassment?"

Bianca hadn't anticipated such defiance. "Running to Adrian again? Is that all you can do?" she spat after a stunned pause.

Vivian's lips curved slightly. "I learned from the best. Weren't you the one playing damsel in distress with your aunt? Unlike you, I don't wait around to be destroyed."

"You struck first!" Bianca trembled with rage as Vivian shoved the blonde toward her, sending the woman sprawling. Towering over them, Vivian's voice turned glacial.

"As Adrian Blackwood's lawful wife and mistress of Blackwood Manor, any insult to me dishonors the entire Blackwood name. Consider this your warning."

"Who are you to lecture me?" Bianca retreated, voice shrill. "My friend's right - you're utterly unworthy of Adrian!"
###Chapter 446

Vivian's lips parted to reply, but her eyes suddenly focused on something behind Bianca. The words died in her throat.

Bianca staggered backward, colliding with a solid chest. Whirling around, she gasped to find Adrian standing inches away. Blind to the storm in his gaze, Bianca jutted out her lower lip. "Adrian, your wife assaulted my friends and humiliated us. And now her plagiarism scandal is dragging the Blackwood name through the mud. You should divorce her."

The sharp crack of Adrian's palm meeting her cheek echoed before she finished speaking. His voice was glacial. "Vivian won't deal with this. I'll handle your discipline myself."

Bianca clutched her stinging face, disbelief widening her eyes. "Adrian—" His withering glare silenced her instantly. Tears of fury gathered as she shot Vivian a venomous look.

Adrian strode past the gathering crowd and took Vivian's hand. Their eyes locked, his icy demeanor thawing into quiet warmth. Though summer heat lingered in the evening air, her fingers felt like ice. He squeezed them briefly, but the chill remained.

"I know about the script. I'll speak to Katrina. Don't worry," Adrian murmured, his thumb brushing her knuckles.

His gaze flicked to Bianca's entourage—privileged girls barely out of college, using family money as weapons. Though only slightly older, they regarded Adrian with the fearful respect reserved for elders. Even their parents spoke his name with reverence.

Adrian's tone turned businesslike. "Insulting my wife means insulting Blackwood Group. Consider all your family contracts terminated effective immediately."

The color drained from their faces. Their pampered lifestyles—funded by Blackwood deals secured through Bianca's father—vanished with those words. The slap had stung, but this humiliation cut deeper.

Bianca rallied weakly. "Aunt Margaret approved those projects! You can't cancel them!"

Adrian ignored her, guiding Vivian toward their waiting car. After settling her inside, he turned back, his voice arctic. "Tell Victor he's a Thornton, not a Blackwood. If I hear he's using our name for business again, I'll reclaim every cent my mother gave you."

Bianca paled. The finality in Adrian's tone struck like a physical blow. Never had she imagined he'd sever ties over Vivian.

Exhausted, Vivian kicked off her heels and curled into the leather seat. As she shifted, something sharp jabbed her back. With a sigh, she reached beneath herself and pulled out a book.

###Chapter 447

The moment Vivian's fingers brushed against the document, Adrian's hand intercepted with surprising gentleness. He placed it carefully on the seat beside him, his long fingers smoothing the crumpled edge with unexpected tenderness. The passing streetlights cast shifting patterns across his sculpted features - the sharp jawline, the aristocratic nose, the intense eyes that seemed to see straight through her.

Whenever Vivian imagined her ideal male protagonist - those piercing eyes beneath perfectly arched brows - Adrian's face materialized in her mind. He wasn't just handsome; he carried an aura of effortless power that made other men seem ordinary by comparison. His very presence commanded attention, yet it was his razor-sharp intellect that truly set him apart.

Adrian's lips curved into a knowing smirk as he pinched her cheek playfully. "See something you like?"

Before she could respond, his fingers slid beneath her chin, tilting her face upward. The kiss was brief but electric, leaving her lips tingling when he pulled away. The temperature in the car seemed to spike several degrees. Vivian's cheeks burned as Adrian adjusted his jacket and crossed his legs, clearly fighting his own desire.

Romance had never been his priority. He'd always maintained strict control over his emotions and impulses. But with Vivian, logic failed him. All he wanted was to hear her breathless pleas, to see those hazel eyes darken with passion.

Changing the subject abruptly, Adrian said, "I had Ethan contact Katrina, but no response yet." His voice was calm. "Creative works often share similarities. If there are parallels, we'll simply explain them."

Vivian blinked in surprise. "You never doubted me?"

Adrian's gaze held hers steadily. "I haven't read your work, but I know you'd never plagiarize." The unshakable faith in his voice made her heart swell.

Just as Vivian opened her mouth to confess her secret, Adrian's phone rang. His expression turned glacial when he saw Dominic's name. "You have sixty seconds," he snapped. "Make it count."

Dominic's excited voice crackled through the speaker. "Forget Katrina! I found something on Audrey's phone. You won't believe who Katrina really is!"

Adrian's grip tightened on the phone. "Get to the point or I'm hanging up."

Before Dominic could continue, Ethan slammed the brakes. The phone flew from Adrian's hand as he instinctively threw an arm across Vivian to prevent her from hitting the seat. Outside, a familiar mocking voice called, "Does the mighty CEO of Blackwood Group make a habit of hitting pedestrians and driving off?"

Vincent Lockwood, Gwendolyn's son, leaned dramatically against the hood before limping toward their car. "Boss, he came out of nowhere!" Ethan protested, unbuckling his seatbelt with visible frustration.

Vincent clutched his leg theatrically. "You broke my leg! Think you can just leave?" His voice rose in feigned outrage.

Ethan gave Vincent's uninjured leg a skeptical glance, then inspected the pristine bumper. The "collision" had left no mark - just another of Vincent's attention-seeking stunts.
###Chapter 448

Vincent Lockwood remained stubborn. "Twenty thousand for my medical expenses," he demanded, rubbing his fake injury.

Adrian Blackwood's voice cut through the air like ice. "Shall we involve the police? They specialize in extortion cases."

The color drained from Vincent's face. His bravado crumbled as he forced a nervous laugh. "Wait, Mr. Blackwood! It's me - my mother Gwendolyn works at Seabreeze Villa. You've seen me around, remember?"

Vivian Hartley arched an eyebrow. Despite the scandal surrounding Gwendolyn's termination, her son appeared clueless about his mother's dismissal.

Under Adrian's glacial stare, Vincent backtracked hastily. "Okay, maybe just two thousand? Just enough for a quick check-up." His tone still carried traces of arrogance.

Vivian massaged her temples, a dull ache spreading behind her eyes. Whether from stress or the biting wind, she couldn't tell. "Just pay him, Ethan," she murmured wearily.

Turning to Adrian, she added, "I feel awful. Please handle this." Her words came out sluggish, her body heavy with exhaustion.

Adrian gave a terse nod. He despised being manipulated, but Vincent's fear was palpable. The reduced demand made the payoff worthwhile to avoid further drama.

Ethan Caldwell pulled out his phone. "Account details," he snapped.

Vincent's demeanor shifted instantly. "Vincent Lockwood. Account number 34—"

The name triggered a flicker of recognition in Vivian, but her discomfort overshadowed it. She curled tighter into herself.

Adrian noticed immediately.

Without comment, he draped a blanket over her shoulders. "Should I call Dr. Harrison?" His voice softened.

Vivian shook her head weakly. "Just chilled from standing outside. That fish at the studio was too strong - made me nauseous. I need rest."

Meanwhile, Ethan finished the transfer. "Money's sent," he warned. "But know this - everything's recorded. Try this again, and you'll regret it. Also, your mother Gwendolyn was fired months ago. She's got no connection to the Blackwoods."

"Fired?" Vincent muttered, checking his banking app. The notification blinked back at him.

###Chapter 449

Ethan didn't waste time responding. He slid back into the driver's seat, the car door shutting with finality as he secured his seatbelt. Without sparing another glance at Vincent, he accelerated into the steady stream of evening traffic.

Inside the vehicle, Adrian's fingers brushed against Vivian's forehead, checking for fever. Satisfied with her normal temperature, he exhaled quietly. His gaze then caught on the phone lying abandoned on the floor mat.

At some point, Dominic's call had disconnected, but Adrian showed no curiosity about the mysterious "Vivian" mentioned earlier. He simply scooped up the device and slipped it into his jacket pocket without hesitation.

When the call ended abruptly, Dominic assumed Adrian was preoccupied. He'd only intended to tease his friend - a small payback for Adrian's sarcastic remarks about his gift last week. Seeing Adrian otherwise engaged, Dominic decided to drop the matter for now.

Turning to Audrey, who was curled up on the couch engrossed in her mobile game, Dominic rested his head against her thigh. "Sweetheart, why's Vivian been hiding her talents all this time? She's clearly exceptional."

Audrey immediately pushed him away. "Not everyone feels the need to show off like Adrian does."

Dominic sprang to his friend's defense. "Adrian doesn't boast - his brilliance just can't be contained. Honestly, have you ever seen anything capable of obscuring the sun?"

Audrey paused mid-game, then smirked at his ridiculous analogy. "Clouds, you idiot. Ever heard of them? They block the sun all the time."

Dominic opened his mouth, then closed it again, thoroughly defeated.

When they arrived home, Vivian remained fast asleep, her breathing steady. Adrian lingered in the car for a moment, watching the peaceful rise and fall of her chest. When she showed no signs of waking, he quietly exited and moved to her side, preparing to carry her inside.

The sudden shrill ring of a phone shattered the quiet. Vivian jerked awake, blinking rapidly. "We're home? Why didn't you wake me?"

Her hand fumbled for the buzzing phone as Damien's name flashed across the screen.

Adrian's expression darkened instantly. "Does Damien not understand time zones? You're collaborating on a project, not working as his personal assistant."

"It might be about the plagiarism accusations," Vivian said quickly, sitting upright and accepting the call. She threw off the blanket and moved to step out when an icy gust made her recoil.

Adrian shot her a look, retrieved the discarded blanket, and wrapped it around her shoulders again. Without a word, he scooped her into his arms.

"Ah!" Vivian gasped in surprise.

Through the phone, Damien's concerned voice came through. "Vivian? Are you alright? What's happening?"

Frowning, Vivian lightly smacked Adrian's shoulder. "Put me down, I can walk myself," she whispered.
###Chapter 450

Adrian glanced down at her bare feet. "How do you plan to walk like that?"

Before she could respond, his voice turned icy as he addressed the caller. "Mr. Vaughn, aren't you crossing a line? Is it really appropriate to speak so casually to another man's wife?"

Damien didn’t back down, his tone sharpening. "Mr. Blackwood, it was your assistant who reached out to me earlier about Vivian. Don’t you know Vivian is Katrina? Seems you’re not fully aware of your wife’s talents."

Adrian froze, his gaze snapping toward Vivian.

On the other end, Damien smirked, satisfied at the tension he’d stirred.

Vivian, uncomfortable under Adrian’s scrutiny, quickly interjected, "Ignore him, Mr. Vaughn. Was this about Katrina?"

Damien’s voice turned serious. "Yes, it’s urgent. You need to access Katrina’s account and make a verification post. I’ll also update your real identity on the company’s official profile."

Still cradled in Adrian’s arms, Vivian continued the conversation, only to feel his fingers lightly tap her hip in playful reprimand.

Once the call ended, Vivian hung up.

Adrian carried her into the living room, settling her onto the couch while keeping her close. His eyes searched hers. "So, Damien knows you’re Katrina. Dominic knows too. Seems like everyone knew except me?"

Shifting slightly, Vivian bit her lip. "It’s not exactly common knowledge. I’ve kept it quiet."

Adrian studied her, his expression softening despite the revelation. He pinched her cheek affectionately. "No more secrets, understood?"

Vivian pouted. "I told you about my scriptwriting when I started. You didn’t seem interested, so I dropped it."

"It wasn’t a secret. You just assumed I wasn’t paying attention."

Wrapped in the blanket, she looked like a petulant child.

Adrian chuckled. "So now this is my fault?"

Vivian nodded firmly. "Exactly. As long as you admit it."

He reached for a cigarette, then reconsidered, taking her hand instead. "You never let anything go, do you?"

She tilted her chin up. "Why should I? I stand my ground, right or wrong. But when I’m right, I don’t back down."

Their banter was interrupted by Adrian’s phone ringing again.

Expecting Dominic, he nearly ignored it—until Serena’s name flashed on the screen.

Adrian and Vivian exchanged a glance. They both knew this call was about the plagiarism scandal.

He hesitated, watching her instead of answering.

...

...
###Chapter 451

Vivian's lips curved in a practiced smile, but her eyes had turned glacial. She squared her shoulders, her voice honeyed steel. "Cut to the chase, Adrian."

Adrian's fingers twitched around his phone. "Serena didn't know you were the scriptwriter initially. When she found out, she defended you publicly. Made several supportive tweets."

The buzzing phone in his palm went silent, its unanswered notification mirroring the growing chasm between them.

Vivian's ribs constricted. His willful blindness to Serena's machinations choked her. Their recent reconciliation had felt genuine - stolen kisses in the elevator, whispered confessions at dawn. But like gilded ice, it melted under scrutiny.

She'd let herself believe his compromises were sincere. Sending Serena to Azurevale had seemed like surrender. But the bitter truth? Her heart had overruled her mind.

The divorce papers she'd drafted months ago gathered dust, buried under nostalgia and weak-willed hope. Yet Serena's specter loomed, fracturing their fragile truce.

Now, with Adrian invoking Serena's name again, Vivian's doubts roared like a tempest.

Their eyes locked. For a heartbeat, she caught panic flashing in his gaze before he looked away. Her smile turned knife-sharp. "You actually believe those tweets were supportive?"

Adrian opened his mouth, but Vivian continued, voice dripping frost, "If she truly meant to defend me, why post when the scandal peaked? The gossip blogs never named me directly. By 'clarifying,' she confirmed every suspicion. Tell me, darling - was she dousing flames or fanning them?"

Adrian's jaw clenched. Vivian's laugh was brittle. "You're no fool, Adrian. Perhaps you don't understand feminine warfare. But surely you recognize basic media manipulation?"

His fingers brushed a stray curl from her forehead. "Serena had a difficult upbringing. She's flawed, but not malicious. Just... misguided."

Vivian recoiled. "She's twenty-three. Legally accountable since sixteen. How long will you infantilize her?"

Rubbing his temples, Adrian exhaled sharply. "I'll handle this. Don't take it out on her. She's leaving for Azurevale soon."

A mirthless chuckle escaped Vivian. "I thought sending her away meant you'd chosen me. That our marriage mattered more." Her voice cracked. "But I see now - it's not about us. You're giving her carte blanche. No consequences, just... geographical distance."

She turned toward the floor-to-ceiling windows, watching twilight paint the city in bruised hues. The gilded cage of their marriage had never felt more suffocating.
###Chapter 452

Adrian's jaw clenched. "Vivian, don't do this—"

Vivian rose abruptly from her seat. After a tense silence, she finally relented. "Fine. I'll let it go this time. She tried to bury me when I was vulnerable, but I turned her little scheme into my advantage. But mark my words—if she crosses me again, I won't be so forgiving. Instead of asking me to pardon her, perhaps you should focus on controlling her behavior."

She stepped closer until their eyes locked. "If you've chosen to remain married to me, then act like it. Stop trying to play both sides. We live in a modern society, Adrian. A society that doesn't tolerate polygamy... or mistresses."

With that, she turned on her heel and headed upstairs, tossing over her shoulder, "I'm sleeping alone tonight."

Once inside the master suite, Vivian locked the door and dragged a heavy armchair to barricade it. She knew Adrian's stubbornness all too well—it was precisely this trait that had brought them to this impasse.

Perched on the edge of the bed, Vivian stared blankly at the floor. The exhaustion from earlier had evaporated, replaced by the adrenaline from their argument. She grabbed her phone from the nightstand and logged into Katrina's Twitter account, intending to check the latest reactions to Serena's so-called defense.

A notification caught her eye. At the top of her direct messages sat a familiar name.

Serena had written: "Dear Katrina, I'm sure you've seen the online controversy about Vivian plagiarizing your work. As both your fans and professionals in this industry, we strongly condemn such dishonest behavior. We have all her submission records and creative process documentation. If you're considering legal action for copyright infringement, we stand ready to support you."

Vivian let out a bitter laugh. Serena was clearly desperate to ruin her, scheming at every turn. She typed a terse reply: "Unnecessary." Serena, clearly glued to her phone, responded instantly: "Katrina, you must have solid evidence then. I look forward to your victory. Justice always prevails. Our legal system will hold all plagiarists accountable."

Vivian paused, a sly smile playing on her lips. Her fingers flew across the screen as she typed: "This is Vivian."

Serena sat frozen on her designer sofa, staring at the message in disbelief. After a long silence, she handed the phone to Miranda. "What's happening with Katrina's account? Is this some kind of joke?"

But Miranda didn't answer. Instead, her eyes remained fixed on the screen as she said, "Look at Katrina's latest tweet."

Frowning, Serena closed the message and navigated to Katrina's profile. The pinned post made her blood run cold, all confusion replaced by utter shock.

"Hello everyone, I'm Katrina, the screenwriter. I'm also Vivian, the actress. Writing was always my private passion. We all have different facets, and I chose to write under a pen name. Thanks to your love and support, those stories found their audience. Recently, due to personal circumstances, I accepted a commercial script. While balancing creative work with real-life responsibilities, I used a new pseudonym. In the process, I inadvertently included some old blog content in the script. This was simply a misunderstanding that could have been resolved quietly. But when the production company demanded compensation and didn't receive it, they severed ties. Now I have no choice but to address this publicly. Thank you to everyone who defended originality—your support is why creators like me continue to believe in our craft."

The forced revelation, born from chaos, had far greater impact than any planned announcement could have. Twitter's servers nearly crashed under the traffic. Within minutes, a new hashtag trended worldwide: #VivianIsKatrina. The twist was so dramatic it seemed fictional—a struggling soap actress revealed as one of Hollywood's most celebrated screenwriters. Fans dug through Vivian's past, even discovering why Sebastian had always been her staunch defender—Katrina had been his idol, someone he'd publicly admired for years. Vivian's status skyrocketed overnight. The fallout surpassed even Damien's wildest predictions.

Serena found herself back in the harsh spotlight, with sharp-eyed netizens dissecting the hidden barbs in her tweets. For those unaware of their history, opinions remained divided—some argued Serena had good intentions but poor execution. She could never have anticipated such an absurd, game-changing revelation.
###Chapter 453

Vivian's fingers trembled violently as the phone slipped from her grasp, shattering against the marble tiles like fragile glass. The spiderweb of cracks mirrored the fractures in her heart.

How? How could Serena always come out unscathed?

Adrian remained motionless on the sofa for thirty agonizing minutes, conflict etched across his chiseled features. When he finally rose, his footsteps echoed through the silent penthouse. The bedroom door resisted his first attempt - locked. A bitter smile touched his lips as he remembered the biometric override. His thumb hovered over the scanner when Miranda's caller ID flashed across his screen.

"Mr. Blackwood!" Miranda's panicked voice pierced through the receiver. "It's Serena - she collapsed. They're rushing her to St. Mary's."

At Seabreeze Villa...

A faint engine roar drew Vivian to the floor-to-ceiling windows. She watched Adrian's midnight blue Bentley glide down the winding driveway, its taillights disappearing into the velvet darkness. An icy dread coiled around her chest. There was only one place he'd be rushing to at this hour.

The weight of realization threatened to crush her when salvation arrived in the form of Audrey Winslow, brandishing greasy paper bags and clinking bottles. "Celebration time!" Audrey announced, shoving the aromatic packages into Vivian's arms before kicking off her designer heels onto the priceless Persian rug.

Vivian recognized the scent instantly - that legendary street vendor's barbecue from their college days. No fancy marketing, just generations of secret recipes that made food critics weep. Only Audrey would remember this comfort during her darkest hour.

With a resigned sigh, Vivian joined her best friend on the rug that cost more than most people's annual salary. Audrey tore into the food with abandon, leaving greasy fingerprints on the ivory wool without a second thought. Vivian found herself strangely comforted by the rebellious act.

"Where's His Royal Grumpiness?" Audrey asked between bites, glancing around the empty penthouse.

Vivian picked at her skewer with forced nonchalance. "Gone to Serena, obviously. The moment my tweet went viral."

The unspoken words hung heavy between them. Some things never changed.
###Chapter 454

Vivian popped open a beer bottle with her teeth and handed it to Audrey. "Tell me honestly, what's so great about Serena? She's nothing extraordinary."

Audrey accepted the beer, taking a long swig that sent bubbles dancing down her throat. After a thoughtful pause, she spoke in a measured tone. "Some patterns are hard to break."

Vivian hesitated before confessing, "I actually talked to Dominic about this—" She raised her hands defensively. "Not betraying you, I swear. Just thought since he's Adrian's friend, he might see things differently."

Audrey turned sharply toward Vivian, curiosity flashing in her eyes. "And?"

"Dominic thinks Adrian doesn't have romantic feelings for Serena," Vivian continued carefully. "More like a sibling bond."

Audrey's eyebrows knitted together before she let out a bitter laugh. "That's the most ridiculous excuse I've ever heard."

"How can two unrelated adults have a 'sibling relationship'? Are they emotionally adopted or something?"

Vivian shrugged. "I can't explain it either. But something feels... off. Like there's a missing piece we're not seeing."

She cracked open another beer with the same dramatic flair and took a deep drink. "Look, I'm with Dominic now, so I'm not judging. But seriously, we can't both be stuck in toxic relationships, right?"

Audrey exhaled slowly, shaking her head. "Adrian isn't like that. If there was something between them, he would've told me. What possible secret could be so big that he'd rather fight with me daily than just explain it?"

Her voice cracked with frustration before she sighed again. "Maybe this is karma. Maybe in a past life, I destroyed Serena's entire bloodline, and now she's haunting my marriage like some vengeful spirit. She won't even let me breathe."

"Enough sad talk," Vivian declared, clinking her bottle against Audrey's. "Tonight we celebrate your sudden stardom!"

They both tipped their bottles back in unison. Vivian let out an unladylike belch before grabbing her phone and opening Instagram.

Ivory Phoenix Productions had reposted Vivian's viral moment, turning it into promotional gold for Ambermyst. Vivian Hartley, the acclaimed screenwriter, was now being hailed as the real-life embodiment of her own strong female protagonist—fans were calling it art imitating life in the most spectacular way.

Vivian scrolled through endless praise-filled comments, beaming brighter than if the compliments had been for herself. Another burp escaped as she grinned. "Talent always rises, babe. You're absolutely slaying! I never expected it to blow up like this."

What neither noticed was Audrey's account had gained an astonishing ten million followers overnight, surpassing Vivian's by four million.

Meanwhile, Adrian sat motionless on the clinic's leather sofa. The sterile lighting carved his sharp features into marble perfection—his undone cuffs and loosened navy shirt the only signs of disarray. A cigarette hung forgotten between his lips as he stared into space.

The silence stretched.

And stretched.

And—
###Chapter 455

The physician scrutinized him for a long moment before finally speaking. "Ms. Whitmore's condition has deteriorated considerably. If her emotional instability persists, her body may trigger a defensive rejection response. In that case, we may need to consider a second transplant."

In previous consultations, the doctor had recognized that Serena wasn’t truly ill. As a private facility accustomed to indulging the melodramas of wealthy lovers, they had dismissed such theatrics. But now, the severity of the situation warranted a stern warning to Adrian—lest he react explosively later.

With deliberate precision, Adrian plucked the cigarette from his lips, tapping it against the edge of the ashtray before crushing it out. His piercing gaze locked onto the doctor. "And what happens to the original heart if a second transplant becomes necessary?"

"Pardon?" The question caught the doctor off guard. He had anticipated concern for Serena, not the organ itself. After a brief hesitation, he replied, "A second procedure would render the original heart nonviable."

Adrian's frown deepened. "Is it possible to re-transplant the original heart into another recipient?"

The doctor’s pen hovered midair. "Highly improbable. Any rejection would compromise its functionality beyond repair."

Adrian stood abruptly, his expression hardening. "Prioritize preserving the heart."

"But some of the stronger immunosuppressants could do more harm than good to her," the doctor cautioned.

Adrian's face remained unreadable. "At all costs, preserve the heart."

"Understood, Mr. Blackwood." The message was painfully clear—Adrian cared more about the heart inside Serena than Serena herself.

Later that night, after one too many drinks, Vivian and Audrey were pleasantly buzzed. One sprawled across the coffee table, the other slumped against the couch, murmuring incoherently.

Adrian returned home in the dead of night. Stepping into the living room, he took in the chaos—empty bottles, spilled liquor staining the pristine carpet, and half-eaten takeout scattered about. His expression darkened instantly.

Pausing in the doorway, he pulled out his phone and dialed Dominic, his voice icy. "Get to Seabreeze Villa now and collect your woman."

Startled awake by the sharpness in Adrian's tone, Dominic bolted upright in bed. Still groggy, he fumbled for his clothes, not entirely sure which woman Adrian was referring to.

Circling the wreckage, Adrian stopped beside Vivian, who was mumbling under her breath. His name surfaced occasionally amid less-than-flattering remarks.

When he touched her shoulder to lift her, her eyes fluttered open. Spotting the polished leather shoes in front of her, she scowled.

He expected her to either ignore him or snap at him. Instead, she weakly shoved at his leg, clad in tailored trousers. "Move. You're ruining the carpet."

Adrian exhaled sharply. "Now you care about the carpet? You've treated it like a dumpster."

Vivian glanced around—empty bottles, beer stains, and discarded chicken bones tangled in the fibers. A flicker of guilt crossed her face, and she straightened slightly, as if trying to shield the mess from his view.

(Continued...)
###Chapter 456

Adrian's lips curled into a sardonic smile as he drawled, "Trying to hide it again?"

"Do you really think that'll make it disappear?"

As he spoke, he leaned forward slightly, his piercing gaze sweeping over the ruined carpet behind Vivian's trembling form.

Stumbling to maintain her balance, Vivian braced herself against the plush sofa, her voice dripping with defiance. "It's just a damn carpet. I'll replace it."

Her mind flashed to the hefty sum Adrian had recently transferred for that limited-edition fountain pen. Compared to that, replacing a million-Sterling rug seemed trivial.

Adrian instantly deciphered her thoughts as he settled beside her. "Planning to use the pen money for this little mishap?"

Vivian collapsed onto the couch beside him, her alcohol-laced breath hot with irritation. "Must you always calculate profit margins? Can't you stop being a corporate shark for five minutes with your own wife?"

With effortless grace, Adrian shrugged off his tailored jacket. "A million Sterling isn't worth scheming over. Feel free to try swindling that amount. I won't stop you."

Vivian's face twisted in frustration as she mentally calculated where she could possibly procure such funds.

As if reading her mind, Adrian's smirk deepened. "Realistically speaking, darling, I'm the only one you could possibly con out of a million Sterling."

Vivian stared at Adrian, her gaze burning with unspoken retorts, but the alcohol fogging her brain rendered her speechless.

Their tense silence was shattered when Dominic burst through the slightly ajar living room door. "Adrian, you wanted me to pick up—" His sentence died as his eyes landed on Audrey, sprawled unconscious across the coffee table.

In three swift strides, Dominic was kneeling beside her, gently shaking her shoulder. "Sweetheart, what are you doing here? Let's get you home."

Audrey stirred groggily, her movements sluggish as she attempted to stand. Dominic reached to steady her, his elbow knocking over a half-empty beer bottle that cascaded across the pristine carpet.

Vivian's eyes sharpened instantly as she pointed an accusatory finger. "You've ruined an imported two-million-Sterling carpet. Pay up."

Dominic recoiled in shock, only to send three more bottles tumbling, creating a foamy river of alcohol across the floor.

He turned desperate eyes toward Adrian. "Adrian—"

Without glancing up from his phone, Adrian murmured, "Make it two and a half million."

Dominic's jaw dropped. "You can't be serious! What kind of carpet costs that much?"

Adrian's response was glacial. "Bank transfer?"

Vivian's hand shot to her pocket for her phone—only to find it missing.
###Chapter 457

Adrian noticed Vivian's fumbling movements and peered over her shoulder before extending his hand for her phone. But she jerked it away before his fingers could graze the device, shooting him a suspicious glare.

"What's your game?" she demanded, her words slightly slurred but her wariness sharp.

He exhaled through his nose. "Weren't you searching for this a minute ago?"

"Oh. Right." Vivian blinked slowly, the alcohol haze making her thoughts move through molasses.

Turning her back to him, she pulled up the payment QR code and thrust it toward Dominic. "Scan this."

Dominic's laughter rang out. "Viv, the app has transfer limits. That amount won't go through."

Vivian considered this for three long seconds before retracting her phone. Just as Dominic thought he'd dodged the bullet, she opened her banking app with dramatic flourish. "Wire transfer then. Here's my account details."

Dominic's pleading eyes found Adrian. "Come on, man. You're not actually entertaining this madness, are you?"

Adrian's expression remained an unreadable mask. "Business is business, Dom. Friendship doesn't alter facts."

Gritting his teeth, Dominic pulled out his phone and processed the transfer for two point five million, muttering, "You two are con artists, I swear to god."

Adrian's lips quirked. "Con artistry implies illegality. I'm simply a transparent entrepreneur."

Not daring to argue further, Dominic scooped up Audrey. "We're leaving. Enjoy your ill-gotten gains."

Once the door clicked shut, Adrian turned to Vivian with predatory calm. "Now transfer one point five million to me," he said as casually as discussing the weather.

Vivian pocketed her phone with deliberate slowness. "And why would I do that? That's my hard-earned money."

A dry chuckle escaped Adrian. "Because you and your little friend destroyed the Persian rug. Or have you forgotten your promise to compensate me?"

Vivian's vision blurred, Adrian's face splitting into twins. She shook her head sharply. "That rug belongs to both of us. Why should I pay the full price? It's just beer stains - I'll have it professionally cleaned tomorrow. At most it'll cost five grand."

"Alternatively," she continued, already tapping on her phone, "I'll send you the cleaning fee and you can handle it." The payment notification chimed on Adrian's device.

Patting his shoulder with exaggerated condescension, she added, "There's ten thousand. Consider the extra your allowance."

Adrian studied the notification with amusement. "You've missed your calling as a negotiator."

Vivian waved a dismissive hand. "Everyone has their talents."

The alcohol's grip tightened suddenly, her limbs turning to lead. Like a marionette with cut strings, she collapsed onto the nearest couch, hugging a throw pillow to her chest as the room spun.
###Chapter 458

Adrian accepted the transfer with a swift tap, pocketed his phone, and rose gracefully. Bending down, he gathered Vivian into his arms with practiced ease. "Time for bed," he murmured against her hair.

Too exhausted to protest, Vivian simply nestled closer, her cheek pressing against his chest.

Adrian carried her to the master bedroom, laying her gently on the silk sheets. As he attempted to straighten, her arms suddenly tightened around his neck. The unexpected movement sent him tumbling forward, his muscular frame pinning her beneath him. His breath hitched as their lips nearly brushed, but in that moment, her grip slackened. She turned away, curling into the plush duvet, her breathing evening out almost immediately.

Adrian remained frozen for a heartbeat, watching the steady rise and fall of her shoulders. With a quiet exhale, he pushed himself up and retreated to the ensuite bathroom without another word.

Morning light filtered through the curtains when Vivian awoke to find the other side of the bed vacant. The faint clatter of dishes from downstairs suggested Adrian was already in the kitchen. She stretched languidly, the lingering scent of whiskey on the sheets triggering memories of last night's bold demand from Dominic. Her fingers flew to her phone, and sure enough - $2.5 million glowed on her banking app screen.

This, she realized, was why wealthy men were dangerous. Even inebriated and barely coherent, she'd walked away with a fortune.

After showering and changing into soft loungewear, Vivian hesitated at the top of the stairs. Their ongoing cold war felt increasingly absurd after last night's drunken escapade, yet Serena's shadow still loomed between them.

The living room stood empty, but through the French doors she spotted Beatrice carefully pruning rose bushes while Leonard sat nearby, reading glasses perched on his nose as he scanned the financial section.

"Leonard! Beatrice!" Vivian called as she stepped onto the terrace. "What a lovely surprise!"

Beatrice turned with a radiant smile. "Vivian, darling! We didn't want to wake you."

Vivian hurried to take the gardening shears from Beatrice's hands. "You should have," she chided gently, linking arms with the older woman.

"Nonsense," Beatrice patted her hand. "You've been working so hard lately - you needed the rest."

Leading Beatrice to the wrought-iron bench beside Leonard, Vivian greeted him softly. "Good morning."

"Hmm," came his gruff reply, eyes never leaving his newspaper.

Beatrice produced an ornate velvet box, revealing an exquisite lavender jade bracelet that caught the sunlight in mesmerizing hues. "I saw this and thought of you immediately," she said, sliding the cool stone onto Vivian's wrist. "Purple jade symbolizes protection and prosperity."

Vivian's breath caught at the delicate weight against her skin. "It's beautiful. Thank you."
###Chapter 459

"We're family; no need for formalities," Beatrice said with a warm smile, deftly steering the conversation. "How are things progressing with Adrian regarding the baby?"

Vivian's fingers instinctively brushed against her flat abdomen, her expression turning slightly awkward. "Nothing to report yet."

Beatrice showed no trace of disappointment. She reached out to squeeze Vivian's hand reassuringly. "These matters can't be rushed."

"The more you obsess, the more elusive it becomes. Just relax and let nature take its course."

Vivian nodded absently, her gaze drifting toward the doorway as if searching for someone.

Beatrice noticed immediately. "Adrian left for the office earlier. He won't be joining us for lunch, but don't worry, Leonard and I will keep you company."

Vivian mentally inventoried the kitchen supplies, considering the elderly couple's dietary preferences. She stood abruptly. "Beatrice, Leonard, our pantry's looking rather bare. Please make yourselves comfortable while I pop out to the market." Her natural caretaker instincts kicked in—not out of obligation, but genuine affection for her in-laws.

Beatrice caught her wrist with an amused chuckle. "You seem so composed, yet you're always springing into action. We've barely settled in and you're already planning dinner preparations. There's no hurry, darling. Meal time is hours away." Her tone held nothing but fondness.

Recognizing their sincere desire to simply spend time with her, Vivian obediently retook her seat. As she did, Beatrice added, "We came to enjoy your company, not to watch you work yourself ragged. We may be getting older, but we don't want to be a burden. In fact, I've already sent staff to handle the shopping. They should return shortly. Just sit with me and let's have a proper chat."

True to her word, Blackwood Manor staff soon arrived laden with grocery bags. "Mr. Blackwood, Mrs. Blackwood," they greeted before noticing Vivian and adding respectfully, "Mrs. Vivian Blackwood."

Once the staff had deposited their purchases in the kitchen, Beatrice's demeanor grew serious as she addressed Vivian. "Vivian, I'm aware of the... complications in your marriage, particularly regarding Serena. Adrian seems utterly bewitched by her, deaf to all reason. Now that he's taken over the Blackwood legacy, we can't simply scold him like a child—it would undermine his authority and our family's standing."

Vivian responded softly, "Beatrice, I truly value your understanding and the kindness you and Leonard have shown me."

Beatrice's expression softened with visible relief. "Your willingness to give Adrian another chance shows your feelings for him remain strong, and that there's still hope for him. I only hope this time, you'll both nurture your relationship more carefully."

Vivian blinked in confusion. Was this the sole purpose of their visit?

Noticing her puzzlement, Beatrice explained, "We visited the hospital yesterday and saw Serena. Her condition appears to be worsening."

The revelation clarified their sudden visit. They'd likely witnessed Adrian's interaction with Serena and, hearing divorce rumors, wanted to reassure her. But Serena's predicament was the least of Vivian's concerns. Instead, she grasped Beatrice's hand, her worried gaze scanning both elders. Relieved to see them looking hale and hearty, she asked gently, "Are you both alright? Nothing serious from your checkup, I hope?"

"Just routine maintenance," Beatrice replied, touched by Vivian's genuine concern. In the Blackwood family, expressions of worry often masked ulterior motives. To Beatrice and Leonard, Vivian's sincerity was refreshingly pure.
###Chapter 460

The golden years had brought them wisdom, but what they cherished most now was genuine connection amidst a lifetime of power plays. Leonard carefully folded his newspaper, his voice thoughtful. "Adrian might not have been the most devoted husband lately, but he and Serena share history. It would be cruel for him to ignore her troubles completely."

"I understand your perspective," Vivian replied, though privately she disagreed. She knew how hard it was for Leonard, once the family patriarch, to fully grasp her viewpoint given their generational differences. Yet she appreciated their good intentions, choosing not to argue. Maturity had taught her life wasn't about absolutes, but navigating complex shades of gray where motives intertwined.

A maid approached discreetly. "Mr. Blackwood, Mrs. Blackwood, dinner is served."

Vivian flashed a warm smile. "Your cooking is always exceptional. I can't help overeating whenever I visit Blackwood Manor."

Beatrice chimed in cheerfully, "I heard your chef resigned recently. Since you enjoy our meals so much, why not have our cook stay at Seabreeze Villa? You're looking rather slim, especially if you're planning for children soon. You're already camera-ready, no need to chase impossible beauty standards."

"Noted, Beatrice," Vivian responded warmly, helping the older woman rise. Beatrice tugged at Leonard's newspaper. "Enough reading, dear. Time to eat."

As Vivian guided Beatrice toward the dining room, her phone vibrated. After ensuring Beatrice was comfortably seated, she checked the caller ID: Julian Montclair.

Noticing the name, Beatrice's eyebrows lifted in curiosity. She leaned toward Leonard, whispering, "Julian... isn't he...?"

Leonard nodded. "Adrian's nephew."

Beatrice looked puzzled. "I thought Adrian severed ties with the Montclairs?"

"Julian was actually my senior in college," Vivian explained. "Back then, I didn't know about his connection to Adrian's family."

A knowing smile crossed Beatrice's face. "How serendipitous. Maintaining family bonds is usually worthwhile." Her expression then turned wistful. "Adrian always seems so detached. In wealthy families like ours, blood relations can feel like distant acquaintances. Yet invisible ties persist, pulling us together whether we acknowledge them or not."

Though Vivian had never probed deeply into Adrian's rift with the Montclairs, Beatrice's words piqued her curiosity. "Is there particular bad blood between Adrian and Julian?"

Beatrice seemed surprised. "Hasn't Adrian discussed this with you?"

Vivian lowered her eyes, shaking her head. "Adrian communicates more like a CEO than a husband. He simply warned me to avoid Julian without explanation."

Nodding, Beatrice clarified, "The conflict stemmed from business ethics. As you know, the Blackwoods strictly prohibit involvement with gambling, drugs, or similar vices."

Vivian nodded in understanding. Historically, Blackwood enterprises avoided all ventures connected to such industries, even in regions where gambling was legal. Notably, they'd never entered the casino business.
###Chapter 461

The revelation made Vivian's instincts flare. She turned to Beatrice, her voice laced with cautious curiosity. "Could Julian possibly be involved in something like this?" Even as the words left her lips, Vivian mentally dismissed the idea. Julian's impeccable reputation made such speculation seem absurd.

Beatrice's response was enigmatic. "In a way, yes. But it was his father who had the gambling problem. Leonard had to step in, ultimately cutting him off from the Blackwood Group to force him to face his demons." She shot her husband a knowing look. "You know how stubborn our men can be."

Leonard maintained his stern expression. "Why drag me into this? We're discussing Charles' actions, not family traits."

Watching the elderly couple's playful bickering brought a smile to Vivian's face. She wondered if she and Adrian might share such lighthearted moments in their golden years.

Beatrice continued with a chuckle, "Charles didn't stop there. He moved on to horse racing in Silverpine, made a fortune, then relocated to Rosewood and established himself as a prominent casino operator."

Leonard sighed deeply, leaning back in his chair. "Charles has an iron will - completely different from Richard. If Richard had possessed even half that determination, Adrian wouldn't have had to shoulder the Blackwood legacy alone so young."

Vivian pieced together that Richard must be Adrian's father, while Charles was Julian's.

Beatrice's expression darkened. "Unchecked determination can be dangerous. Gambling is one thing, but he's entangled with underworld figures overseas. It's only a matter of time before disaster strikes."

Vivian leaned forward, startled. "Does Julian know about this?"

Beatrice shrugged. "We've lost touch since Adrian severed relations with the Montclairs. Charles has lived abroad for years - they're practically strangers now."

Leonard added thoughtfully, "There was a brief period when Julian studied abroad in Ravenshore. Their relationship might have improved then."

Beatrice scoffed. "I doubt Charles would involve Julian in his dealings. Julian's always been principled and upstanding - nothing like his father."

After a pause, Beatrice turned to Vivian with a warm smile. "Since you already know Julian, maintaining contact would be good. Family connections matter. And you, my dear, have such a radiant presence."

"Your positivity could be a good influence on him."

Before Vivian could respond, her phone buzzed urgently.

###Chapter 462

The phone buzzed insistently on the marble countertop. Beatrice arched an elegant brow. "That sounds important, dear. You should get it."

Vivian hesitated for only a heartbeat before swiping to answer. "Julian." Her voice remained perfectly composed.

There was nothing improper about her relationship with Julian Montclair, and avoiding his call in front of Adrian's grandparents would only raise unnecessary questions.

Julian's rich baritone flowed through the speaker. "Have you had dinner yet?"

Vivian glanced at the lavish spread before them. "We're just sitting down. Leonard and Beatrice are here with me."

A pause. Then Julian's tone shifted to apologetic. "I'm interrupting family time."

The dining room was so quiet they could hear every word. Vivian turned to the elderly couple. "Please don't wait for me. Go ahead and start."

She moved to serve them, but Beatrice waved her off with a knowing smile. "We're perfectly capable, darling. Take your call."

Vivian focused back on the phone. "Julian, what's wrong? Is there something you need?"

Another beat of silence. Then Julian's voice dropped to that careful register she recognized. "The recipient of Serena's transfer—Vincent Lockwood—he's your housekeeper Gwendolyn's son."

Vivian's breath caught.

Vincent.

The name slammed into her consciousness like a thunderbolt.

She remembered him from the "car incident" investigation.

Now she understood why it had tickled her memory then.

A cascade of realizations flooded her—Gwendolyn's inexplicable coldness, her prying questions about Vivian's schedule, all those odd moments Vivian had dismissed. The puzzle pieces clicked into place with terrifying clarity. Gwendolyn wasn't just difficult—she was Serena's mole.

"Vivian?" Julian's voice pulled her back. "Are you still there?"

She forced her lips into a smile no one could see. "I'm fine. Thank you for telling me this."

"Do you need backup?" Julian's offer came softly. "Anything at all?"

"This is... a family matter." Vivian kept her tone light even as her fingers traced nervous patterns on the tablecloth. "I'll handle it."

"I understand." Julian's voice carried that subtle note of disappointment she'd come to recognize. "Just remember—my line's always open for you."

The call ended, leaving Vivian staring at her reflection in the polished silverware.

Her mind whirled with implications.

Gwendolyn had been in her home for years.

Had access to everything.

Knew all her habits.

And now...

Now she knew exactly who'd been betraying her all along.
###Chapter 463

The moment the phone call disconnected, Beatrice froze with her fork halfway to her mouth, her sharp gaze locking onto Vivian. "What's happened? I caught something about Serena transferring money to your housekeeper's son. Explain."

Decades of experience as the Blackwood matriarch allowed Beatrice to instantly grasp the gravity of the situation.

Meanwhile, just beyond the gates of Seabreeze Villa, a sleek Mercedes sedan idled by the curb. Inside, Julian Montclair ended his call and absently tapped his phone screen against his palm.

Shadows veiled his usually charming features, leaving only an uncharacteristic coldness in his posture.

His associate Donovan shifted beside him. "Mr. Montclair, you never warned Ms. Hartley beforehand. Why contact her now? With Adrian's grandparents present, they'll undoubtedly take his side."

A humorless smirk curled Julian's lips. "Ignorance keeps them off-balance. They need to understand the full picture before they inevitably defend Adrian again." His fingers swiped across his phone, pausing at an unflattering photo of Vivian retching on set. "This way, when everything collapses, Vivian will have nowhere to hide behind family loyalty."

Donovan frowned. "But they just reconciled."

"Perfect timing for another fallout, don't you think?"

Julian's meaningful silence spoke volumes as he continued scrolling through his phone.

Back at the villa, Vivian laid out the scheme for the stunned elderly couple - how Serena had not only bribed the housekeeper to spy but also hired Vincent Lockwood to orchestrate an online smear campaign.

Beatrice gasped, her fork clattering against her plate. "I knew Serena was unpleasant, but this is downright villainous!"

Leonard remained silent, his expression thunderous.

Noticing their hesitation to defend Adrian, Vivian reassured them. "It's handled. The housekeeper has been dismissed."

Leonard added sternly, "And I'll ensure her family relocates far from Crestwood permanently."

The front door swung open as Adrian strode in. His gaze swept over the tense gathering at the dining table. "No one waited for me? How rude."

Leonard fixed him with a steely glare. "You still expect to join us for dinner?"

Adrian slipped off his shoes, accepting slippers from a maid. "What crime have I committed to warrant starvation?"

Beatrice set down her wine glass with deliberate precision. "When exactly do you plan to send Serena away?"

Approaching the table, Adrian shrugged. "As I explained last night, her heart condition requires special care." His tone suggested he'd expected his grandparents to show more compassion.

The sharp clink of Beatrice's fork against her plate punctuated her icy words. "Her health isn't your responsibility. You should be more concerned about your wife - unless you've abandoned all thoughts of starting a family?"
###Chapter 464

The sunlight streamed through the bay windows as Adrian Blackwood lounged beside Vivian Hartley, his fingers brushing a stray lock of hair from her face with practiced ease. "Everything requires moderation," he murmured, his lips curling into that infuriatingly charming smirk. "If we don't pace ourselves, it'll overwhelm her delicate constitution."

Vivian swatted his hand away with a pointed glare, her eyes darting toward the elderly couple seated across the dining table.

Leonard Blackwood cleared his throat. "Willowbrook has the finest cardiac specialists. Transferring her there could provide better treatment options."

"Out of the question." Adrian's response came sharp as shattered crystal. "She stays where I can monitor her condition personally."

Misunderstanding

Adrian caught the flicker of displeasure crossing Vivian's features and quickly changed tactics. "Let's not dwell on unpleasant topics," he suggested smoothly, though tension coiled beneath his polished demeanor.

With a snap of his fingers, he summoned a servant. "Bring me fresh cutlery. I haven't dined yet."

The truth was, food held no appeal. This was merely a diversion.

Vivian studied him for a long moment before squaring her shoulders. Better to address the elephant in the room now, with witnesses present. "Those trending hashtags about me weren't accidental," she began, her voice deceptively calm. "Vincent Lockwood orchestrated the smear campaign. Financial records show Serena Whitmore transferred funds to him."

The servant arrived with gleaming silverware, but Adrian's hand froze mid-reach. His expression darkened momentarily before smoothing into practiced neutrality. He'd suspected as much, but confronting Serena in her current state would only exacerbate matters - or so he told himself.

Accepting the utensils, Adrian adopted a reasonable tone. "She met Gwendolyn Pierce socially. This could simply be unfortunate timing. Vincent has always been a con artist - remember how he staged that collision to extort money?"

His casual dismissal sent ice through Vivian's veins. She despised how effortlessly he excused Serena's malice. But since these events predated their reconciliation, she bit back her frustration - for now.

"Perhaps," she conceded coldly, making her disbelief abundantly clear. Deliberately ignoring the steak he'd placed in her bowl, she selected a crisp vegetable instead. "No investigation necessary. My sources already confirmed everything. I'm willing to let bygones be bygones, but while she's convalescing at the estate, ensure she doesn't cause more... disruptions."

Across the table, Beatrice Blackwood shot her grandson a withering look. Unfazed, Adrian patted his grandmother's hand. "No need for concern, Gran. We'll handle our affairs privately."

His words carried dual meaning - both reassurance and subtle boundary-setting.

Turning back to Vivian, Adrian's voice softened. "I'll have Ethan look into this."

Vivian didn't believe him for a second. Any inquiry would mysteriously yield no results. Just like always.
###Chapter 465

Adrian's brows knitted together in a slight frown. "Which friend? Audrey?"

Vivian didn't answer right away, focusing on her meal without glancing his way. After deliberately chewing her food, she finally spoke. "The real problem here is Serena. If you want to play pretend, be my guest. But don't drag others into this mess—it's pathetic. These rumors didn't appear out of thin air. Where there's smoke, there's fire. Instead of damage control, you should be fixing the actual problem."

With deliberate slowness, she picked up the piece of steak Adrian had placed in her bowl and dropped it back onto his plate.

Adrian's lips quirked in amusement at her defiance as he ate the rejected morsel himself.

Turning to his grandparents with exaggerated exasperation, he joked, "Grandpa, Grandma, see how she treats me? Her temper's getting worse by the day."

Beatrice, ever the peacemaker, chuckled. "If your wife has a temper, it's your duty to indulge her. Real men pamper their wives. Only weaklings try to rule their households like tyrants."

Though her tone was light, Beatrice's eyes held concern. The fragile peace between Adrian and Vivian felt like the calm before a storm. Serena's continued presence loomed over them like a dark cloud threatening to burst.

After dinner, Leonard and Beatrice retired to the guest suite. Vivian personally arranged for Beatrice's maid to stay in Gwendolyn's old room. While cleaning, the maid discovered a suspicious package tucked beneath the bed. Recognizing it as the same herbal supplement Margaret had once prepared for Vivian at the Blackwood estate, she assumed it had been forgotten during their last visit.

Thinking nothing of it, the maid carried the package to the kitchen.

As Vivian passed by, the maid stopped her. "Mrs. Blackwood, should this tonic be taken before bed?"

Vivian's eyes flickered to the familiar packaging, assuming Beatrice's maid had brought it from the main house. "Yes, warm it up and bring it to my room before I retire," she instructed absently.

Neither woman questioned the package's sudden appearance. The previous batch Vivian brought had already been consumed by Gwendolyn. If this was new, where had it come from?

Turning from the maid, Vivian found Adrian leaning against the hallway wall, watching her with an unreadable expression. His lips curved when their eyes met. "The Sinclairs treat you like their own granddaughter, while I feel like a guest in my own home."

Vivian responded with a noncommittal hum, her disinterest palpable.

Unwilling to let it go, Adrian pushed off the wall. "Still upset about Serena? We've been over this. Her project isn't finished, and her current treatment won't extend her stay. I'm not keeping her here deliberately."

Vivian's irritation showed as she wondered if their disconnect stemmed from gender differences or simply stubbornness. "Is that all?"

He hesitated, choosing his words carefully. "I'm investigating those rumors about you. If Serena's behind them, she won't get special treatment."

After a weighted pause, he added, "But it's all in the past now. Whatever the truth, we should move forward." His protective tone regarding Serena made his priorities painfully clear.
###Chapter 466

"Got it," Vivian said, sweeping past him with purposeful strides.

She made up her mind to go upstairs, change into something stylish, and lose herself in a shopping spree with Audrey. The golden sunlight streaming through the windows seemed to cut through the artificial chill of the air-conditioned mansion.

Vivian selected a daring violet halter top with an open back, pairing it with flowing white linen trousers that whispered with every step.

Without a sound, Adrian appeared in the doorway. He rummaged through her wardrobe before producing a high-necked blouse. His hands settled on her bare shoulders as he frowned. "This would be more appropriate."

Vivian twisted away from his touch, eyeing the offered garment with distaste. "I just spent forty minutes on my makeup. That turtleneck would smudge everything."

Adrian set the blouse aside and retrieved a leather moto jacket instead. "At least wear this over it. That top shows too much skin."

She rolled her eyes heavenward. "It's ninety degrees outside. Are you trying to give me heatstroke?"

Determined, Adrian continued searching until he presented three alternative tops. "These all provide adequate coverage. That backless number is completely unacceptable."

Vivian nearly laughed. The cutout was barely the size of a postcard - hardly scandalous by modern standards. She hadn't realized her husband harbored such antiquated views about women's fashion.

Not wanting to argue over something so trivial, she grabbed the least offensive option and pulled it on. "Happy now?"

Adrian's critical gaze lingered. "That fabric is practically sheer. I can still see—"

With dramatic flair, Vivian began unbuttoning the new top. "Should I just go naked then?"

He retreated hastily. "No! That one is... marginally acceptable."

Satisfied, Vivian snatched her designer handbag and headed for the door.

Ever since her secret identity as Katrina Spencer had been revealed, Vivian found herself constantly recognized. To avoid paparazzi, she and Audrey always met at an exclusive by-appointment-only boutique tucked discreetly inside a downtown office tower.

The boutique catered to elite clients with a curated selection ranging from ready-to-wear pieces to rare couture finds. Its owner, a poised woman in her early thirties with an understated elegance, greeted Vivian with a freshly prepared tea service.

"Mrs. Blackwood, you must try these," the owner said, presenting an artfully arranged dessert plate. "I trained under pastry chefs in Azurevale specifically to perfect these recipes."

Vivian selected a delicate mille-feuille. The crisp layers dissolved on her tongue, revealing a perfect harmony of tart berries and vanilla cream. "This is extraordinary," she murmured. "Better than anything I've had at those famous Azurevale patisseries in Crestwood."

Before the owner could respond, the boutique's door burst open with enough force to rattle the crystal chandelier.
###Chapter 467

"Vivian? What a surprise to see you here."

Vivian and the boutique owner both turned toward the entrance where a woman dripping in designer labels stood. Her cashmere coat alone cost more than most people's monthly rent, and the diamond-studded watch on her wrist caught the light with every movement. The scent of her exclusive French perfume preceded her like an invisible announcement of wealth.

In contrast, Vivian's ensemble was effortlessly elegant. Her camel-colored trench coat was perfectly tailored but bore no visible branding. The only hint of luxury was her understated leather tote - practical yet refined, chosen precisely for its spaciousness during shopping excursions.

Vivian's pause lasted only a heartbeat before her practiced social mask slid into place. "Giselle. It has been years."

Giselle Thornton, née something far less impressive, had been Vivian's high school classmate. They'd never moved in the same circles, and apart from Audrey, Vivian had maintained little contact with their graduating class.

Vivian had always been an enigma - her striking beauty paired with an aloof demeanor creating an impenetrable aura. She vaguely recalled Giselle coming from modest beginnings, her parents working double shifts at the textile mill. While Vivian wasn't one to judge, even she had noticed Giselle's... limitations. Concepts that came easily to others seemed to elude her, and rather than applying herself, Giselle had dedicated her adolescence to scheming her way into wealthy circles.

Apparently, her efforts had paid off spectacularly.

Giselle flipped her freshly highlighted hair over one shoulder and commandeered the chair opposite Vivian. "Service!" she snapped her fingers at the barista.

The young woman behind the counter, unfazed by the rudeness, simply smiled. "We just received a shipment of Ivory Summit beans - quite rare this season."

Giselle's nose wrinkled. "Never heard of it. I only drink Sapphire Ridge."

As the barista prepared their drinks, she caught Vivian's eye. The subtle exchange spoke volumes - both recognizing Giselle's transparent attempt at sophistication. Ivory Summit beans retailed at nearly five times the price of Sapphire Ridge, yet remained unknown to casual coffee drinkers who associated quality with brand recognition alone.

Vivian accepted her cup, admiring the delicate latte art - a crescent moon with tiny stars scattered beneath it. The first sip brought a smile to her lips. "The citrus notes are exceptional."

Giselle snorted. "That childish scribble? The café near my penthouse does proper designs - swans, roses, that sort of thing." She waved a dismissive hand. "This place is overhyped."

The barista, wise beyond her years, simply continued smiling as she wiped down the espresso machine.

With no audience to perform for, Giselle turned her attention to Vivian. "Where's that handsome husband of yours? Too busy making millions to join you?"

Vivian took another measured sip before answering. "Adrian's at the office." Her tone suggested the conversation would end there.

But Giselle, never one to read social cues, barreled forward. "You know, I ran into Serena Whitmore last week at the Opal Galleria. She was asking about you." A calculated pause. "And Adrian, of course."

Vivian's fingers tightened imperceptibly around her cup. The name hung between them like an uninvited guest.

Giselle's smile turned feline. "Funny how life works out, isn't it? Who would have thought back in high school that you'd end up married to her..." She let the sentence dangle, watching for Vivian's reaction.

The boutique's bell chimed again, saving Vivian from responding as two well-dressed women entered, their laughter filling the small space. Giselle immediately straightened, her social antennae quivering at the potential for new connections.

Vivian used the distraction to check her watch. "Excuse me," she murmured, gathering her things. "I have an appointment."

Giselle barely glanced up from adjusting her diamond tennis bracelet. "We should do lunch," she said absently, already assessing the newcomers' handbags for authenticity.

Vivian's smile didn't reach her eyes. "We really shouldn't."

Outside, the crisp autumn air felt like a reprieve. Vivian inhaled deeply, the lingering tension easing from her shoulders. She pulled out her phone, thumb hovering over Adrian's contact before thinking better of it. Some ghosts were better left undisturbed.
###Chapter 468

Vivian arched a perfectly sculpted eyebrow, her lips curling in amusement. "Weekend overtime? Which corporate giant has him chained to his desk?"

"Blackwood Group," she replied, feeling Giselle's presence souring both her mood and appetite. Lately, Vivian had been battling fatigue and nausea, her stomach rejecting even her favorite dishes. Just when she thought she might manage a few bites, Giselle's incessant chatter descended like a swarm of locusts, stripping away what little appetite remained.

Giselle's manicured fingers paused mid-air, her coffee cup hovering. "Blackwood Group?" She leaned forward with sudden interest, her designer bracelets clinking. "My lover has connections there. What division does your husband work in? Perhaps they could collaborate." Her smile turned predatory. "I could put in a good word for him."

Vivian's instincts flared. She hadn't anticipated Giselle having ties to the Blackwoods. The family's influence sprawled across Crestwood like ancient roots, their numerous relatives embedded in every sector. But the real mystery was - what self-respecting Blackwood would associate with someone like Giselle?

With practiced grace, Vivian extricated her arm from Giselle's grasp. "That won't be necessary. Their paths aren't likely to cross."

Adrian had been consumed by projects outside his usual scope lately, pushing his limits to master new skills. Ethan had taken over most of his routine responsibilities at headquarters.

Giselle misinterpreted the refusal, assuming Vivian's husband occupied some insignificant position beneath notice. Undeterred, she examined her diamond-encrusted nails. "I always wondered why a socialite like you suddenly plunged into acting." Her gaze flicked to Vivian's simple gold wedding band. "Now I understand - you married beneath your station."

She leaned closer, her perfume cloying. "You were the campus beauty, the heiress. We all expected you to land a tycoon." A theatrical sigh. "Instead you settled for some corporate drone." Her eyes gleamed with malice. "But now that you're famous, you can trade up. Wealthy men won't care about your marital history."

The barb struck a memory - Giselle's humiliating rejection by a wealthy senior who'd then praised Vivian's beauty. That old resentment had festered for years.

Vivian's fingers tightened around her water glass. Most Blackwoods knew her identity, except perhaps the most distant relatives. Studying Giselle's triumphant expression, she asked coolly, "Exactly how is your lover connected to the family? Some obscure cousin twice removed?"

Giselle's face flushed crimson. "How dare you! My lover holds real power there. Even Adrian Blackwood answers to him."

The claim sent a jolt through Vivian. Her mind raced through the family hierarchy before landing on Leonard's face. A shiver crawled down her spine, and she forcefully banished the disturbing thought.
###Chapter 469

Victor had always appeared larger than life, a man who commanded respect with just a glance. The idea that he would entertain someone as vapid as his current companion seemed utterly ridiculous.

Vivian needed to stop these wild thoughts. She cut straight to the point. "Since when did the Blackwood family have someone like that in their circle?"

Giselle noticed the subtle shift in Vivian's tone and straightened with visible satisfaction. For once, Vivian seemed intrigued by something related to her husband. Giselle deliberately paused before dropping her bombshell. "He's Adrian's uncle—Victor Thornton."

A smug smile played on Giselle's lips. Even Vivian, usually so aloof, couldn't resist the pull of high-society gossip. Power like Victor's cast an undeniable shadow. And this attention? All thanks to her man's rising status in Crestwood.

Vivian was speechless.

Just then, Audrey strolled into the boutique, having overheard the conversation. "What? Giselle, since when did you start settling for middle-aged men?" She positioned herself protectively in front of Vivian, her expression dripping with disdain as she scrutinized Giselle.

Giselle startled momentarily but quickly regained her composure. She pressed a dramatic hand to her chest as if to calm her racing heart.

"Audrey!" Giselle exclaimed. "You've changed so much since school—where's that shy girl I knew? You nearly gave me a heart attack! And middle-aged? Please. Victor is distinguished, not old."

She tossed her hair. "I've moved past those immature college boys and their meaningless flings. I prefer men who know what they want."

Vivian's mind wandered to the rumors about Victor's wandering eye—the arranged marriage, the whispered affairs. She never imagined one of her former classmates would become entangled in such drama.

She studied Giselle critically. Despite the designer labels screaming wealth, her plain features couldn't be disguised.

After a beat, Giselle countered, "Audrey, tell me—are you even married yet?"

Audrey pulled out a chair beside Vivian and sat down. "Why the sudden interest? My personal life is none of your business."

Taking the cue, Vivian gave Giselle a sidelong glance and added coolly, "If I recall correctly, Victor already has a wife. And unless something's changed, it's not you."

Audrey smirked. "Maybe you're just bitter because no one wants to marry you."

Giselle's expression darkened. "What do either of you know? Victor and his wife? That's not a marriage—it's a corporate merger. She's just another trust fund princess." She paused for effect. "Speaking of money, Audrey, your family's quite wealthy too, aren't they? Better hope your future husband doesn't turn out like Victor—disinterested and unfaithful. Or maybe you should aim for someone like Vivian's husband. At least a regular office worker is easier to control."

"Regular?" Audrey turned to Vivian in surprise.

Vivian barely registered the comment. Adrian's stern, unreadable face flashed in her mind. She suppressed a laugh, wondering how he'd react to being called "easy to control."

Giselle reached for her coffee but withdrew her hand when she realized it had gone cold. With an exaggerated sigh, she stood, her tone turning dismissive. "This conversation is pointless."

She adjusted her designer bag. "Our lives—and our perspectives—have changed since graduation. Anyway, there's a class reunion coming up. You're both invited. Will you be there?"
###Chapter 470

Vivian hesitated to respond, but Audrey cut in swiftly. "Absolutely, we'll attend. And we're bringing our significant others. Let's see if your so-called sophisticated gentleman dares to show his face in public!"

Giselle scoffed, adjusting her designer purse. "He'll be there, darling. Unlike some people's mediocre husbands, my man commands attention. Vivian, if you're tired of being tied to that nobody, just say the word. Victor knows plenty of influential men."

With one last contemptuous glance around the boutique, Giselle announced, "Pathetic selection. I won't waste my time here again."

Audrey turned to Vivian with gleaming eyes. "You must bring Adrian. I'm dying to see Victor's reaction when he realizes that 'insignificant employee' is actually the Blackwood heir."

Vivian stared into her coffee cup, the delicate foam heart now dissolved into shapeless bubbles. Her emotions felt equally turbulent. She had no doubt Adrian would attend. The real concern was their increasingly strained relationship. Playing the perfect power couple might only deepen the cracks between them.

Meanwhile, Adrian was wrapping up at Blackwood Group headquarters, contemplating dinner plans with Vivian when his phone buzzed. Serena's name flashed on the screen.

"Adrian," came the playful voice when he answered, "I'm at this charming little bistro but forgot my wallet. They don't accept cards here."

"Shouldn't you be at the medical center? Where's Miranda?" Adrian's brow furrowed with concern.

Serena's voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. "Don't tell Miranda! She was at the office today, so I sneaked out. Hospital food is torture - I'd rather starve than endure another bland meal."

The youthful lilt in her voice unexpectedly transported Adrian back to their university days.

"Send me your location. I'm on my way," Adrian said brusquely before ending the call. He glanced at Vivian's contact still open on his screen, then locked his phone decisively.

Audrey had been shopping with relentless enthusiasm, selecting outfits and accessories. Vivian modeled various ensembles - her natural grace elevated every look, though the process felt increasingly tedious.

As they exited the boutique, a necktie caught Vivian's eye. The midnight silk shimmered with platinum threads forming celestial constellations. Remembering Adrian's appreciation for meaningful gifts, she handed it to the sales associate. "Could you wrap this, please?"

Audrey emerged in her latest purchase, catching the exchange. Expecting teasing about her romantic gesture, Vivian was surprised when Audrey simply asked, "Do they have this in emerald? Dominic would adore it."

Returning to Seabreeze Villa, Vivian found the older guests had departed.

The housekeeper approached, drying her hands. "Mrs. Blackwood, have you eaten? Mr. Blackwood mentioned he won't be joining you for dinner tonight."

"Just something light," Vivian replied casually, slipping off her heels. She placed Adrian's gift on the side table near his reading nook before retreating to the walk-in closet to change.

The silence of the villa felt heavier than usual as twilight painted the ocean-view windows in shades of gold and violet. Vivian's fingers lingered on the gift box, her reflection in the floor-to-ceiling mirrors showing the subtle tension around her eyes that no amount of practiced smiles could conceal.
###Chapter 471

Vivian descended the marble staircase, her bare feet sinking into the plush carpet. The scent of seafood wafted through the air as the housekeeper approached with a delicate porcelain bowl. "Mrs. Blackwood, it took three markets to find decent crab roe this season. I've prepared it with hand-pulled noodles, along with avocado crab rolls and mango salsa as appetizers."

Her stomach growled at the mention of crab, Vivian's favorite indulgence. She practically skipped to the dining table, her silk robe fluttering behind her. But as the first forkful neared her lips, a sudden wave of nausea crashed over her.

She barely managed to push the plate away before doubling over, dry heaving into the silver wastebasket nearby.

The housekeeper rushed forward with a crystal glass of ginger tea and a linen napkin. Vivian waved her off weakly. "You have the crab. Just make me some plain noodles with extra chili oil, would you?"

"Shall I call Dr. Harrison, Mrs. Blackwood?" The housekeeper's brow furrowed with concern. "You've been pale all week."

Vivian shook her head. "Just a stomach bug, nothing serious." She forced a smile, though her hands trembled slightly.

After a hesitant pause, the housekeeper lowered her voice. "Forgive me for saying so, but... have you considered taking a pregnancy test?"

The words hit Vivian like a thunderbolt. Her teacup clattered against the saucer. "A pregnancy test?"

After picking at her dinner, Vivian retreated to the master suite. She curled into the velvet chaise lounge, intending to watch an old French film. But exhaustion claimed her before the opening credits finished rolling.

Her breathing slowed as she sank deeper into the cushions, one hand resting unconsciously over her abdomen.

Adrian returned home to find his wife asleep in a pool of golden lamplight. The sight made his breath catch - Vivian's chest rising and falling gently, her hair fanned across the cushions like spilled ink. The summer heat had left a dewy sheen on her collarbones, making her skin glow like polished pearls in the dim light.

He reached out without thinking, his fingers brushing the delicate curve of her ankle. Her skin was cool from the evening breeze drifting through the balcony doors. The contrast between her chilled skin and his warm touch sent a jolt through him. His hand lingered, tracing absent circles on her calf.

Shrugging off his suit jacket, Adrian bent to gather her into his arms. Just as he slid one hand beneath her knees, Vivian's lashes fluttered open.

"Adrian?" Her voice was thick with sleep, her eyes unfocused. She blinked up at him like a disoriented kitten.

The sight made his chest tighten. He lowered her gently back onto the chaise, unable to suppress a grin. "Dreaming about me, darling? You were making the most adorable little noises."

Vivian bolted upright, immediately patting her mouth with the back of her hand. When she found no drool, she shot him a glare that would melt steel. "You're insufferable!"

Adrian stretched his arms behind his head, the picture of feline satisfaction. "Guilty. Got any plans to punish me?" His smirk widened as her cheeks flushed pink.
###Chapter 472

The playful teasing enveloped them like a cozy embrace, easing the lingering stress of the day.

Vivian wrinkled her nose, finding his smug expression more irritating than his usual aloof demeanor. This version of Adrian—playful and mischievous—was somehow more exasperating than his typical reserved self.

Adrian's gaze landed on a small velvet box resting on the side table. He lifted it, examining the delicate wrapping. "What's this? A little present for me?"

Crossing her arms, Vivian huffed. "For someone who's been particularly insufferable lately."

His lips curved into a wider grin, amusement dancing in his stormy gray eyes.

He carefully unwrapped the box, revealing a silk tie in deep emerald green. Holding it against his crisp white shirt, he tilted his head. "Well? Does it suit your taste?"

Vivian's breath caught as she took in the way the fabric complemented his sharp jawline. After a beat, she managed a quiet, "It... looks decent."

Adrian tucked the tie back into its box with surprising gentleness. "Perfect. I'll wear it to tomorrow's board meeting. You can help me with the knot."

Vivian stifled a yawn, her curiosity getting the better of her. "Why are you home so late? Where were you?"

Her tone was casual, but the way her sleep shirt slipped slightly as she tilted her head revealed a glimpse of collarbone that caught the light—and Adrian's attention.

He abruptly turned away, masking the flush creeping up his neck. "Just finishing some contracts," he muttered.

But Vivian, already losing interest, stretched with another yawn. "I'm going to shower and collapse. I've been exhausted lately—my body's practically screaming for rest."

As she turned, Adrian moved with panther-like grace, his arms encircling her waist and pulling her flush against him. His voice dropped to that low, teasing register that always made her pulse stutter. "You're ready for bed, and I haven't even had dinner."

She blinked up at him, confused. "You skipped dinner? What were you doing all evening? Want me to make you something? There's probably pasta in the—"

Adrian's gaze dropped to her lips, slightly parted and impossibly inviting. He leaned in until their breaths mingled. "I don't want pasta," he murmured, the words barely audible.

Before she could respond, his lips captured hers in a kiss that conveyed everything words couldn't—the longing, the affection, the unspoken promises.

The kiss deepened, slow and intoxicating. Vivian arched upward to meet him, but the angle strained her neck. She tried to pull away.

Adrian only tightened his grip, one hand sliding up her back to keep her close—eliminating any chance of escape.

Just as the intensity became almost overwhelming, Vivian felt Adrian's lips part slightly against hers...
###Chapter 473

Vivian's breath came in soft gasps as she whispered, "I'm exhausted," her voice laced with playful exhaustion.

Adrian's gaze softened momentarily before darkening with raw hunger that threatened to consume them both.

Without hesitation, he lifted her effortlessly, the delicate silk of her sleepwear riding up to reveal legs as smooth as polished marble, glowing in the dim bedroom light.

He lowered her onto the bed with deliberate care, his rough fingers tracing a path from her ankle upward, exploring every curve of her toned thigh.

His touch sent electric currents through her body, the contrast between his calloused hands and her soft skin making her shiver. As he fumbled with the intricate ties of her pajamas, frustration flickered across his face.

After two failed attempts, Adrian gave up on finesse, tearing the delicate fabric apart with a single decisive motion.

The sound of ripping silk hung in the air, charged with primal energy.

Never one to miss an opportunity, Vivian arched an eyebrow. "That was limited edition, darling. Imported from Paris."

Adrian's low chuckle vibrated through her as he countered, "I'll replace it with twenty more."

His breathing had grown ragged, his intense stare making her skin prickle with anticipation.

The torn garment revealed more than just her body - it unveiled her uninhibited confidence.

Her raven-black hair cascaded over her shoulders, partially obscuring her form like shadows playing across a moonlit landscape.

She appeared both delicate and untamed, a paradox that left him momentarily breathless.

Under his scorching gaze, Vivian felt a rare moment of vulnerability before quickly masking it with practiced ease.

With deliberate slowness, she lifted one leg and draped it over his shoulder, her toes brushing his earlobe with teasing precision. Adrian's control shattered.

The metallic clink of his belt buckle filled the room as he freed himself from restraint.

When Vivian tried to lower her leg, he caught her ankle, holding her in place with possessive certainty.

Then, to her surprise, he pressed a reverent kiss to the arch of her foot - a gesture so unexpectedly tender it sent warmth flooding through her veins.

The moment felt sacred, like a knight paying homage to his queen.

This simple act awakened something deep within her, an emotion too complex to name but impossible to ignore.

As Adrian finally claimed her, his lips traced a burning path along her collarbone, each kiss a silent vow, each nip a promise.

His hot breath against her neck made her pulse race, their breathing synchronizing in perfect harmony.

His eyes drank in the sight of his marks on her skin - a constellation of passion that filled him with primal satisfaction.

His hands mapped every curve of her body with possessive precision, as if committing her to memory.

When his fingers brushed her waist, he marveled at how perfectly she fit against him. Vivian's eyes fluttered open, locking with his in a moment of startling clarity. Her gaze, bright with unshed tears, seemed to see straight into his soul.

A sudden wave of uncertainty washed over her, a reminder of the fragile foundation beneath their passion. In this moment of intimacy, she couldn't help but voice the question burning in her heart. "Have you ever kept anything from me?" Her voice held no accusation, only a quiet yearning for truth.

Adrian froze. The recent deception he'd maintained echoed in his mind. His heart stuttered as he answered too quickly, "Never."
###Chapter 474

A sudden vulnerability gripped Vivian, exposing the delicate foundation of their relationship. The intoxicating pleasure could fabricate intimacy, yet beneath it all lingered a fragility she couldn't dismiss.

Without warning, a question escaped her lips, tender yet probing. "Have you ever kept anything from me?" Her voice carried no accusation, only a quiet plea for certainty amidst the emotional storm.

Adrian stiffened. The recent omission weighed heavily on his conscience. His pulse quickened as he answered with forced calm, "Never."

The night melted into gentle caresses and whispered affections, leaving Vivian so thoroughly spent that sleep claimed her effortlessly.

Morning light revealed a WhatsApp notification from Giselle, detailing their upcoming high school reunion. The message concluded with a "thoughtful" postscript:

"Don't forget your husband. If work keeps him busy, just say the word—my husband will have a word with his supervisor."

Beside her, Adrian stirred, his sleep-heavy arm draping possessively across her waist. His fingers brushed against her phone.

"Who's demanding your attention at this hour?" His morning voice, rough with sleep, sent shivers down her spine as his warm breath teased her ear.

Vivian squirmed away from his tickling lips with a laugh. "An old classmate invited us to a reunion," she answered, powering off her phone with a decisive click.

Turning to face him, she sank deeper into the pillows. Even with his eyes closed, Adrian appeared less intimidating—his sharp features softened by sleep and the play of shadows across his face.

Overcome with tenderness, Vivian booped his nose, eliciting a boyish grin.

He captured her wandering hand effortlessly, pulling her flush against him. "When's this reunion?" His voice wrapped around her like velvet.

Tucking a stray lock behind her ear, she nestled closer. "Day after tomorrow. Would you come with me?"

His eyelids lifted, revealing dark eyes that held galaxies of unspoken promises. "Is that what you want?" His voice resonated like a cello's lowest note.

Their gazes locked. Cradling his stubbled cheeks, Vivian smiled. "Isn't this invitation obvious enough?"

Adrian remained steadfast. "I need to hear you say it. Do you want me there? Yes or no."

Her hands slid to his chest as she surrendered with a playful sigh. "Yes, Adrian. I want you by my side at this reunion."

Satisfaction illuminated his features as he pressed a kiss to her forehead. "Then I'll be there."

###Chapter 475

The reunion day came faster than expected. The venue was set near the picturesque Seabreeze Villa. Vivian didn't make a big fuss about it, sticking to her usual routine. She spent the morning on the film set and returned home by noon. With Adrian buried in work, she had lunch with their live-in housekeeper.

"Mrs. Blackwood," the housekeeper murmured hesitantly, "you've missed your vitamins for several days now. Shall I bring them earlier today?"

Vivian's cheeks flushed pink as she realized the housekeeper might have overheard her and Adrian's nightly activities. "I'll skip them for now," she replied, touching her stomach. "I've been feeling a bit queasy lately. They're just supplements anyway - no rush."

"Very well," the housekeeper nodded, relief evident in her expression. Glancing at Vivian's glowing complexion, she thought privately, "With how often Mr. Blackwood keeps her company, she probably doesn't need any supplements."

After lunch, Vivian retreated to the bedroom and immediately fell asleep. When Audrey's call came through, she was deep in dreamland.

Answering with sleep-heavy voice, she heard Audrey's teasing tone. "Darling, how can you nap when there's a major event tonight?"

Yawning and stretching, Vivian rubbed her eyes. "I've been exhausted lately. I meant to review my script but fell asleep the moment I lay down."

As she spoke, something felt off. Despite having a lighter schedule recently, her fatigue seemed worse than usual.

Before she could dwell on it, Audrey sighed dramatically. "Tell me about it. Ever since Dominic came into my life, I'm constantly worn out. My back aches nonstop."

Vivian shook her head, pushing away her thoughts. It was true - keeping up with Adrian's boundless energy was more tiring than any work commitment.

Ending the call, Vivian moved to her walk-in closet without enthusiasm. Her eyes skimmed over the lavish gowns, feeling they might be too extravagant for a simple class reunion.

A song began playing on her phone - "Purple looks divine on you" - and her gaze landed on an amethyst dress. This happy coincidence, where external cues influenced decisions, made her smile.

She chose the fitted purple dress with delicate pleats at the waist that accentuated her curves. The knee-length hemline struck the perfect balance between elegance and allure.

From her jewelry collection, she selected a double-strand pearl necklace, the premium Akoya pearls glowing with soft luster.

After dressing, she texted Adrian to meet her at the Harbor Grand Hotel after work. Standing by the door in heels, she debated between calling a driver or taking a taxi when Julian appeared at the garden gate.

"Vivian," Julian called through the ornate iron bars. "Going somewhere special?"

Opening the gate, she smiled. "Just a dinner event. What brings you here, Julian?"
###Chapter 476

The afternoon sun cast golden streaks across the pavement as Vivian adjusted her violet dress.

"Just visiting a friend nearby." Julian's gaze lingered on her stiletto heels. "Those aren't safe for driving. Where are you headed? Let me give you a ride."

Vivian started to shake her head. "That's not necessary, I'll just call—"

A maid interrupted, "Mrs. Blackwood, Mrs. Beatrice Blackwood sent over fresh fruits from the orchard. I need to fetch them from the main house."

"Is that so?" Vivian acknowledged with a polite nod.

When she turned back, Julian was smiling in that infuriatingly charming way.

"Will you accept my offer this time?" His voice held a teasing lilt.

Abandoning her resistance, Vivian stepped forward. "Alright, let's go."

Julian gestured toward the street. "My car's just outside." As they walked side by side, Vivian mentioned, "It's a high school reunion today."

Facing her with raised eyebrows, Julian remarked, "High school? I might know some people there." His college years as student council president had made him acquainted with half the campus.

Vivian laughed softly. "Doubtful. It's from my hometown."

At the curb, Julian produced keys with a flourish, stopping before a gleaming red Ferrari. "Your chariot awaits, princess."

The ostentatious vehicle made Vivian pause, but she quickly masked her surprise and slid into the leather seat. "This doesn't seem like your style."

"Just a loaner while mine's in the shop," Julian explained as he closed her door, then added in a lower tone, "That shade of violet suits you perfectly." His observation mirrored her earlier thought, sending an unexpected jolt through her.

It was uncanny how Julian always seemed to know her mind, as if their thoughts traveled along invisible threads connecting them across space and time.

A flush crept up Vivian's neck. She looked away, murmuring, "Oh? Thank you."

Julian settled into the driver's seat, one foot still on the pavement. Turning to her with sudden seriousness, he said, "Vivian, you're not bound by Blackwood family protocols with me. We knew each other long before Adrian entered the picture. Let's keep things between us... uncomplicated."

His intense gaze made Vivian's pulse stutter, as though he'd glimpsed some secret emotion she hadn't acknowledged herself.

Over the years, she'd nurtured a quiet reverence for Julian—a connection that defied conventional labels. To Vivian, their bond existed in the realm of kindred spirits, transcending the need for constant interaction. He felt like a piece of her soul that had wandered off into the universe.

This sensation wasn't exclusive to people; sometimes she felt it with a particularly striking sunset or haunting melody.

Though typically oblivious to romantic cues, something about Julian's demeanor today felt... different.

###Chapter 477

Did Julian Montclair have feelings for her?

The realization sent a jolt through Vivian Hartley's system, her fingers tightening around her clutch. "I'm Adrian Blackwood's wife," she stated firmly, lifting her chin. "That makes me part of the Blackwood family hierarchy now."

Julian's aristocratic features softened as he withdrew into his luxury sedan. The door closed with a muted thud. "Adrian and I have never seen eye to eye," he admitted, his voice carrying a rare note of vulnerability. "Truthfully, I've never wanted any connection to the Blackwood legacy."

His piercing gaze held hers through the tinted window. "It's... difficult for a man my age to suddenly find himself addressing a woman he once mentored as his senior in family standing."

Vivian studied him intently, the momentary illusion dissipating like morning mist. His eyes showed no hidden affection, only the familiar guardedness she'd always known. Her grip on the clutch gradually loosened.

Heat crept up her neck.

If Julian had ever harbored romantic feelings, he would have confessed during their university days. Back when she'd been just a wide-eyed freshman and he the untouchable senior. The notion that he'd develop feelings now, when she was married to his least favorite relative, bordered on absurd.

She pressed her lips together, chiding herself for the momentary vanity. Age was making her increasingly self-absorbed.

Spotting Vivian's arrival, Giselle Thornton twirled dramatically toward the banquet hall. "Ladies and gentlemen," she announced with theatrical flair, "our reigning campus queen has graced us with her presence. How many broken hearts will we be nursing tonight, now that she's permanently off the market?"

The lively chatter in the private room died instantly as all heads turned toward the entrance.

Time had etched its passage on most of their former classmates' faces - but not Vivian's. Secretly, many had hoped the years would dim her radiance, that their once-unattainable goddess would have descended to mere mortality.

Instead, she stood before them like a rare vintage that had only improved with age. The girl they remembered had blossomed into a woman of breathtaking elegance, her beauty refined rather than diminished by the passing years.

The men found themselves transfixed. The object of their youthful fantasies stood before them, more dazzling than ever, yet her heart belonged to someone they considered wholly unworthy.

A collective wave of regret, bitterness, and what-could-have-been washed over them.

Meanwhile, the women huddled together, their whispers sharp with envy. "Those pearls around her neck must be worth a fortune," one murmured.

"And that dress - isn't that from the new Valentino collection?" another hissed.

Before Vivian's arrival, Giselle had been busy weaving her poisonous narratives.

Now someone voiced the question they'd all been thinking: "I thought her husband was just some junior executive? That jewelry alone would cost more than a Blackwood Group VP makes in a year. Are they living beyond their means? Or is this all just for show?"

Another classmate smirked. "These days, you can get decent knockoffs for pocket change. That 'pearl' necklace? Probably plastic from some back-alley vendor."

The whispers continued, growing increasingly vicious as the champagne flowed.
###Chapter 478

The elevator doors slid open with a soft chime.

"Vivian, where's your husband? Too busy to join us today?" Giselle approached with saccharine sweetness, her designer heels clicking against the marble floor.

Julian remained concealed behind the elevator's control panel, his tall frame hidden by Vivian's slender silhouette. Just as Giselle took another step forward, Julian emerged from the shadows.

The moment Giselle recognized his face, her confident stride faltered. The practiced smirk she'd perfected over years of social climbing melted into an uncharacteristic flush. "Julian? Julian Montclair? Is that really you?"

Vivian turned toward Julian, eyebrows arching in genuine surprise. "You two are acquainted?"

Julian offered Giselle a polite but distant smile. "My apologies, I don't quite recall. Perhaps you were part of the debate club during my senior year?" The unspoken implication hung in the air - he'd had countless admirers during his university days, and Giselle clearly hadn't made enough impression to be remembered.

That "I'm sorry" wasn't merely about his faulty memory. It was also his discreet way of avoiding Vivian's question without outright lying.

Vivian caught the nuance immediately, her lips curling in silent appreciation.

She felt no sympathy for Giselle. The woman had willingly become Victor's mistress, and now her obvious infatuation with Julian felt like an insult to his impeccable reputation.

Giselle's face cycled through emotions like a broken kaleidoscope - hope, desperation, wounded pride. "We attended middle school together," she insisted, voice trembling. "Don't you remember that little stationery shop near Fairwyn Academy? You bought me a fountain pen when I forgot my wallet. I've kept it all these years."

Julian's expression remained politely blank. "Forgive me, but such gestures were commonplace for me. Whether for classmates or strangers, even street beggars - I never gave it much thought." His tone was gentle, but the dismissal cut deeper than any insult.

Giselle recoiled as if struck. To him, was she truly no different from some homeless vagrant?

Then suspicion dawned in her narrowed eyes. She looked between Vivian and Julian, voice shaking. "Did you two arrive together?"

Vivian met her gaze with cool detachment. "Isn't it obvious?"

Giselle's breath hitched. "Your husband... he's not... not Julian, is he?"

Ice crept into Vivian's voice. "No."

A shadow of disappointment flickered across Julian's features, gone so quickly one might have imagined it. The corners of his lips lifted in a wistful smile. "Unfortunately, I'm not that fortunate."

The corridor lights caught in his eyes, turning them into pools of liquid silver. The raw sincerity in his voice made Vivian's pulse stutter for one treacherous moment.
###Chapter 479

The doubt in Julian's eyes deepened. His gaze lingered on Vivian for a heartbeat too long before he schooled his expression into perfect neutrality. With the practiced ease of a man who had spent years concealing his vulnerabilities, he said, "You should catch up with your classmates. I have a business meeting to attend."

As Julian walked away, Giselle's glare burned into Vivian's back. Her fingers twisted the fabric of her dress so tightly her knuckles turned bone-white.

She had always despised Vivian. Even back in their school days, Vivian had effortlessly drawn everything Giselle coveted but could never grasp.

Teachers favored her. Classmates admired her. Even the lunch ladies slipped her extra portions, as if she deserved more than anyone else.

How could someone like Vivian—unwanted in her own home—be so adored by the world? It's that face of hers, Giselle seethed. People are shallow. They only see beauty. But Julian? He wasn’t like that.

He wasn’t the kind of man to be swayed by something as trivial as looks. No, Vivian must have tricked him somehow.

The thought festered in Giselle’s mind.

Vivian had seduced him.

And Julian—he was still entertaining her, even knowing she was married.

If Vivian could have him despite being tied to another man, why couldn’t Giselle, who was free and unclaimed? She wasn’t that timid girl anymore.

She had traveled the world, tasted luxury, and carried herself with a confidence she’d never possessed before.

With renewed determination, she inhaled sharply and called out, "Julian—wait!"

He paused, turning to glance at her over his shoulder.

His expression was polite but detached, his confusion evident.

Giselle fumbled with her clutch, pulling out her phone. "Since fate brought us back together, why don’t we exchange numbers? It’d be nice to stay in touch."

Julian’s face remained unreadable. "I think you’re mistaken. We weren’t close before. There’s no reason to be now."

Vivian, who had been watching silently, arched a brow. "How bold of you," she remarked lightly. "Adding men to your contacts so casually. Doesn’t your fiancé mind?"

Giselle’s face flushed crimson. "Vivian, shut your mouth! I’m not engaged. Unlike you—married and still clinging to other men. Does Julian even know you’re taken?"

Julian’s gaze softened as it settled on Vivian. "As long as she doesn’t mind," he said smoothly, "neither do I."

Vivian’s pulse stuttered.

She had deflected flirtations a hundred times before, brushing them off without a second thought.

But this—this was different.

And she wasn’t sure how to respond.
###Chapter 480

But this was different—because it was Julian.

His genuine words made Vivian's carefully constructed walls tremble.

Giselle's mouth fell open, her eyes widening in shock.

What? Did he seriously just offer to become Vivian's kept man if she desired?

The sophisticated, aristocratic gentleman Giselle had idolized had just made such a... submissive, almost degrading proposal.

Vivian regained her composure first. "By family relations, Julian should technically address your boyfriend as his elder."

Giselle froze. "What ridiculous nonsense are you spouting?"

Julian turned to Vivian, confusion written across his handsome features.

Vivian's lips curved slightly. "Her boyfriend is Adrian's uncle."

Julian's expression darkened instantly, his polite mask slipping to reveal pure revulsion.

Without hesitation, he took an instinctive step backward, as though distancing himself from something vile.

"I—" Giselle stammered, her face flushing crimson as she fumbled for words.

But Julian didn't wait for explanations.

He strode past her, his polished Oxfords clicking decisively against the marble floor as he disappeared without a backward glance.

Giselle stood rooted to the spot, her phone still hovering uselessly in midair.

Around her, the classmates who'd witnessed the exchange erupted into hushed whispers.

The humiliation she'd intended for Vivian had backfired spectacularly.

Just then, the elevator doors slid open again, revealing Audrey gliding out with Dominic in tow.

Audrey's chestnut hair cascaded in perfect Hollywood waves, her crimson halter dress showcasing an elegant, toned back that drew admiring glances.

Dominic looked every inch the dashing escort in his tailored black tuxedo with burgundy accents, a single red rose adorning his lapel that matched Audrey's ensemble perfectly.

Audrey's sharp eyes immediately landed on Vivian and Giselle by the elevators.

With a subtle arch of her brow, she disentangled herself from Dominic and sauntered over to link arms with Vivian. "Darling, why are you waiting out here instead of joining the party?"

Dominic glanced at his suddenly empty arm, hesitated for a beat, then broke into a roguish grin.

Shoving his hands in his pockets, he ambled over. "Vivian."

Vivian acknowledged him with a slight nod, her demeanor coolly composed.

Without sparing Giselle so much as a glance, the trio turned toward the private dining room, leaving her standing alone in the hallway.

The cluster of classmates near the entrance scrambled awkwardly to clear a path.

One particularly eager classmate—a heavyset man with an ingratiating smile—stepped forward with outstretched hands. "Mr. Sinclair! What an honor. My firm's been hoping to collaborate with Sinclair Industries on the waterfront development. If you could put in a good word... Back in college, Audrey and I played volleyball together—I always made sure she got the winning shots!"
###Chapter 481

Dominic shot a pleading glance at Audrey, silently begging for her support.

His eyes flickered to the outstretched hand but made no move to accept it. Instead, he turned to Audrey with a playful smirk. "Oh?"

"You used to play basketball with the guys all the time?"

Vivian interjected smoothly. "That's not quite accurate. Audrey was actually quite shy back then. When teams were picked, the girls always chose their own circles. Since Audrey didn't belong to any group, she often ended up playing with the boys."

Only after her explanation did Dominic finally extend his hand for a brief, perfunctory shake.

Beads of sweat formed on the man's forehead as he realized how much weight Dominic gave to Audrey's words. The Sinclair family dominated Crestwood's elite circles, with deep ties to the Blackwood dynasty. Despite Dominic's notorious playboy reputation, he moved in social spheres far beyond their reach.

The man's demeanor toward Audrey shifted immediately, his expression now tinged with newfound respect. Everyone knew Dominic's reputation - constantly surrounded by women yet never committing. These weren't the naive schoolmates of years past.

Sensing the change, they wasted no time showering compliments: "Audrey, who would've thought you'd be the luckiest among us, catching Dominic Sinclair's eye?"

"Mr. Sinclair is quite the catch, and you're absolutely stunning. What a perfect match."

"So when's the wedding? We're all waiting for your big day."

Vivian, noticing their excessive flattery, gently squeezed Audrey's hand with a knowing smile. "That depends entirely on Audrey's decision."

The message was clear - the choice ultimately rested with Audrey.

Dominic chimed in with a grin, "Exactly. If Audrey says no, it just means I need to try harder. But don't worry - I won't give up until she says yes."

Nearby, Giselle watched the scene unfold, her eyes burning with envy.

Why? How could Vivian, a married woman, capture Julian's attention? And how did Audrey, once an outsider, attract the heir of the Sinclair family? It made no sense.

Meanwhile, she was stuck with that disgusting middle-aged man, forcing herself to endure his revolting touch.

Why was life so unfair? She wasn't as beautiful or charming as Vivian or Audrey.

What was supposed to be her triumphant moment had become their stage, leaving her feeling even more insignificant.

Giselle composed herself and stepped forward with a strained smile. Her sugary tone couldn't mask the venom beneath. "Vivian, where's your husband? Didn't you promise to bring him? Why show up with Julian instead? Don't tell me he's too embarrassed now that you're clinging to Julian for support."

Vivian met Giselle's gaze with unshakable calm, her expression inscrutable. "He's still at work," she replied evenly. "But he'll be here soon. Running into Julian was pure coincidence."

Her eyes swept lazily across the room, pausing just long enough to make everyone feel scrutinized. A faint, mocking smile played at her lips. "Speaking of partners, where's your boyfriend? Did his family finally put their foot down?"

The casual barb detonated like a grenade in the quiet room. Everyone knew about Giselle's boyfriend - Victor Thornton. The Thornton family wielded considerable influence in Crestwood, and it was common knowledge Victor was married. The business world often turned a blind eye to such affairs, but Vivian's pointed remark shattered that pretense. Those who'd grown tired of Giselle's pretensions struggled to hide their smirks.

Giselle's face darkened with rage. "Compared to your useless husband," she snapped, "my boyfriend is incredibly busy. You ordinary people wouldn't understand his responsibilities. You probably think executives just lounge around all day, don't you?"
###Chapter 482

Dominic, who had been silently watching the exchange, threw a confused glance at Audrey. "Useless? Ordinary worker? Are you seriously describing—"

His sentence about Adrian Blackwood was abruptly cut off as Audrey elbowed him sharply in the side.

"Zip it," she whispered urgently through clenched teeth, her eyes flashing a warning. "Unless you want to make a complete fool of yourself."

Though Dominic didn't understand the underlying tension, he had enough sense to clamp his mouth shut.

The awkward silence stretched until one of their classmates attempted to diffuse the situation. "Come on, let's not stand around the entrance all night," she said with forced cheerfulness. "We should get seated. Once Giselle's and Vivian's partners arrive, we can finally order."

The mention of Vivian's husband was clearly an afterthought. All eyes were on Giselle's supposedly illustrious boyfriend Victor, who had promised to foot the bill for this reunion dinner.

With polite murmurs and nervous laughter, the group began filing into the private dining room. Several male classmates rushed to play gentlemen, pulling out chairs for Vivian, Audrey, and Dominic.

Giselle seethed as she watched the attention shift away from her. Just minutes ago, everyone had been hanging on her every word about her powerful boyfriend. Now they were fawning over Vivian's circle instead.

Slumping back into her seat, Giselle angrily pulled out her phone and fired off a message to Victor. "Sweetheart, where are you?" she typed furiously.

The reply came instantly but was frosty. "I said I'm coming. Stop pestering me. It's irritating."

Heat flooded Giselle's cheeks. She quickly locked her phone screen, terrified someone might have seen the humiliating exchange.

As she tried to compose herself, the elevator pinged again. A classmate who hadn't yet sat down turned toward the sound. The doors slid open to reveal Adrian Blackwood striding toward them with the effortless grace of someone who owned every room he entered.

The man froze mid-step, his jaw dropping. "M-Mr. Blackwood?" he stammered, voice barely above a whisper.

His reaction sent a ripple through the group as heads swiveled toward the doorway. The atmosphere shifted instantly, charged with electricity. A stunned silence fell before erupting into excited murmurs.

"He's even more gorgeous in person!" "Those cheekbones could cut glass!" "Is he a model or something?" "Why is he coming here?"

The private room buzzed with the kind of energy usually reserved for celebrity sightings. Just as Adrian reached for the door handle, his phone rang. He paused in the hallway to take the call, his imposing silhouette visible through the glass.

From her seat, Vivian admired her husband's profile. Even among this crowd of successful professionals, he stood out like a diamond among pebbles.

A warm glow spread through her chest as she realized this extraordinary man was truly hers. Vivian, long accustomed to being the most admired woman in any room, found greater pride in seeing her classmates awestruck by her husband than she'd ever felt from personal compliments.

There was a time she'd felt like mere dust at Adrian's feet, only notable through reflected glory. But now she understood - she belonged beside him at the summit, not beneath it.
###Chapter 483

Vivian shook her head slightly, trying to clear her thoughts as she sipped the hotel's complimentary tea. It was passable but had an unpleasant bitterness that made her wrinkle her nose. She set the cup down with a quiet sigh.

Giselle had arranged this reunion dinner at the Blackwood Group's Harbor Grand Hotel, flaunting her connections while being surprisingly stingy with the food and drinks. When Adrian paused at the doorway, whispers immediately rippled through the room. "Is Mr. Blackwood here for us?" someone murmured. Another glanced at Dominic and speculated, "Maybe he's here because of Mr. Sinclair?"

"Don't be ridiculous," another scoffed. "The CEO attending his uncle's girlfriend's class reunion? That's a stretch."

A more plausible theory emerged: "Since Giselle is dating Mr. Thornton and this is a Blackwood property, maybe he sent Adrian to comp our meal." This explanation seemed to satisfy the group, and they turned to Giselle with excited chatter. "Giselle, we're so lucky tonight! Having Mr. Blackwood join us is like winning the lottery!"

Giselle sat frozen, her usual confidence shaken by Adrian's unexpected appearance. She'd convinced herself he'd come specifically for her. The possibility made her pulse race. "Maybe he's just passing through," she muttered weakly.

Audrey rolled her eyes dramatically. "Some people will claim connections anywhere. Know your place - you're just the girlfriend of Adrian's uncle. The Blackwoods wouldn't even acknowledge you. And you think Adrian would attend a class reunion for you? Keep dreaming - it's already nighttime."

Dominic gave Audrey an affectionate look and took her hand, ignoring everyone else. Though Giselle shot Audrey a venomous glare, she held her tongue because of Dominic's presence and redirected her anger toward Vivian instead. Her eyes darted between the two women. "If Mr. Blackwood isn't here for me, then who? Surely not for Vivian?"

"Actually, I'm here for my wife," Adrian declared before striding confidently into the room.

"Wife?" A stunned silence fell as everyone exchanged confused glances, scanning the room to identify who among them could possibly be Adrian Blackwood's wife.

Audrey's eyes gleamed with satisfaction as she surveyed the shocked faces around her. A knowing smirk played on her lips as she turned to the man sitting beside Vivian. "Hey, don't you see her husband's arrived? Maybe you should make some space for him."

The man blinked in confusion, his gaze darting between the women before landing on Vivian with utter disbelief. "You mean... Vivian? She's Mrs. Blackwood?"

"Vivian? His wife?" Every head swiveled between Vivian and Adrian like spectators at a tennis match. The revelation hit like lightning, leaving the crowd momentarily speechless. But when they objectively compared all the women present, the conclusion was inescapable - Vivian was clearly the only possible candidate.

No one looked more shocked than Giselle, whose voice rose an octave as she blurted, "That's impossible! I thought Vivian's husband was just some low-level Blackwood Group employee!"

Adrian, completely unfazed by the whispers, approached Vivian with the effortless confidence of a man who owned every room he entered. The man beside her practically leapt from his chair, nearly knocking over a glass in his haste. He grabbed a napkin and frantically wiped down the seat as if preparing a throne before bowing slightly. "Mr. Blackwood, please, have a seat."

Adrian's lips quirked in amusement at the napkin display before settling gracefully beside Vivian. Leaning close, he flicked her nose playfully, his warm smile laced with teasing. "So this is how you introduce me to your old friends? As a low-level employee?"
###Chapter 484

The air in the luxurious hotel suite grew thick with tension as Adrian Blackwood's voice cut through the murmurs. "At Blackwood Group? Is that truly how you see me?" His words dripped with playful charm, yet carried an undercurrent of feigned hurt that made several women clutch their champagne flutes tighter. This was a dance they'd performed countless times before, and Adrian executed it with the effortless grace of a man born to command attention.

Vivian Hartley's lips curved into a knowing smirk as her gaze slid toward Giselle like a dagger finding its mark. "I never made such claims. She came up with that all on her own."

An icy chill swept through the gathering as realization dawned on the assembled guests. Before Vivian's dramatic entrance, many had ingratiated themselves with Giselle by making snide remarks about Vivian. Now, their palms grew clammy as they mentally reviewed every word, praying they hadn't crossed invisible lines. Those who decided they'd stayed within bounds exhaled in relief, edging closer to Adrian as if drawn by magnetic force.

Giselle looked as though she'd been slapped. She collapsed into a chair, her humiliation painting stark lines across her carefully made-up face. But no one spared her a glance - all attention had shifted to the power couple dominating the room.

The class president, ever the opportunist, seized the most expensive champagne bottle on the table - a vintage that retailed for three thousand Sterling but carried a six-thousand-Sterling price tag at the hotel. Just moments ago, it had been the center of admiration, but now, in Adrian's presence, it might as well have been tap water.

A classmate whose family owned a manufacturing plant snapped his fingers at a waiter. "Bring us a bottle of '89 Margaux!" Adrian barely flicked a glance his way. His voice remained casually dismissive as he addressed the server. "Just bring three bottles from my private reserve." His intense gaze never left Vivian, as if the rest of the room had faded into irrelevance.

The factory heir practically vibrated with eagerness. "Yes, absolutely! Whatever Mr. Blackwood prefers!"

The waiter, unfazed by the sycophantic display, nodded professionally before disappearing. When he returned with three unassuming bottles, a wine connoisseur among the guests leaned forward, his eyes widening. "My God... each of these is worth nearly a million Sterling. Extraordinary."

At this revelation, the women abandoned their wistful glances at Adrian, redirecting their envy toward Vivian. Phones appeared like magic, snapping photos of the rare vintages as if capturing unicorns. Even if Adrian remained unattainable, these images would be social media gold - tangible proof they'd brushed against true luxury. Perhaps the right person might notice.

The men weren't far behind, though their motivations leaned more toward networking than social climbing. The class president, sensing an opportunity, poured two glasses from the priceless bottle and approached Adrian with the reverence of a pilgrim approaching a shrine. "Mr. Blackwood, it's an honor beyond words. Thanks to our class beauty here, I have this chance to toast with you. Would you do me the honor?"

Adrian's attention shifted from the offered glass to Vivian. "Darling," he murmured, the endearment sending ripples through the room, "may I have a drink?"

The sudden silence was so complete one could hear a pin drop. Even Dominic Sinclair, normally unflappable, sat up straighter. The cigarette between his fingers burned unnoticed to ash as he struggled to reconcile the Adrian he knew - the man he'd practically worshipped - with this besotted version currently seeking his wife's permission for a drink. It felt like witnessing the laws of physics rewrite themselves.

Audrey Winslow shot a pointed look at Giselle, whose face had frozen into a mask of humiliation, then nudged Vivian with a conspiratorial grin. "Mrs. Blackwood, don't leave our poor class rep hanging! He's been holding that glass so long his arm must be numb. If you don't give the okay, I doubt your husband will even consider that toast."
###Chapter 485

Laughter filled the private dining room as Vivian's former classmates joined in the playful banter. "Come on, Vivian! You remember us from Crestwood High, don't you? We weren't all that terrible! We helped you with cleaning duty, covered for you sometimes - give us some credit here!" A particularly bold woman winked. "We're not trying to steal your husband. Just let us toast to his success - maybe some of that Blackwood magic will rub off on us!"

Vivian's lips curved as she glanced at Adrian, her chest swelling with quiet pride. She gave a subtle nod, her voice barely above a whisper yet carrying undeniable authority. "One drink."

That single permission sent the entire table scrambling to their feet. Crystal glasses clinked as everyone except Giselle raised their drinks with eager smiles. They downed their champagne in one go while Adrian merely touched the rim to his lips, the liquid barely diminishing. The unspoken message wasn't lost on anyone present. Very few people in Crestwood - or anywhere in the world, for that matter - could claim to have persuaded Adrian Blackwood to finish an entire glass.

As the toasting continued, waiters began circulating with dish after extravagant dish - none of which had been on the original menu. Towering seafood platters with rare delicacies, truffle-infused appetizers, and bottles of vintage Dom Pérignon appeared as if by magic. Everyone knew the sudden upgrade came courtesy of Adrian's presence - a privilege Vivian had effortlessly commanded. And it had absolutely nothing to do with Giselle.

Giselle, who had arrived as the undisputed queen of this reunion, now sat stiffly in her chair, her manicured nails digging into the tablecloth. The lavish spread before her - delicacies she could never afford on her sugar daddy's allowance - only twisted the knife deeper. Each glance at Vivian and her perfect life sent waves of bitter resentment crashing through her. She stared at her untouched plate, appetite completely gone.

The cheerful chatter around her might as well have been happening in another universe. Audrey, noticing Giselle's miserable expression, couldn't help but smirk. Even Adrian - whom she normally found intimidating - seemed almost pleasant tonight.

Leaning toward Vivian, she murmured with mock seriousness, "You know, fate works in mysterious ways. Seeing how Adrian's changed for you, I'm almost glad I failed to convince you to divorce him that year."

Vivian's eyes softened as she squeezed Audrey's hand. "Dominic treats you wonderfully too," she replied quietly. Their shared glance spoke volumes - beneath the teasing lay genuine happiness for each other's good fortune.

Adrian, having spent the evening subtly doting on Vivian, had clearly earned her affection. She decided to reciprocate by playing the attentive wife, reaching for a crab to peel for him. But before she could get her fingers messy, Audrey slid a small bowl toward her - already filled with perfectly shelled crab meat and shrimp, courtesy of Dominic's meticulous efforts.

"Save your manicure," Audrey said casually, as if this were completely normal. Vivian accepted without hesitation, portioning some for herself and Adrian. Watching the exchange, Dominic barely suppressed a knowing smile. These three operated on their own wavelength - best not to interfere.

Giselle, meanwhile, was silently combusting with rage. Every interaction between Vivian and Audrey felt like salt in her wounds. How had these two nobodies ended up with men who were not only wealthy but devastatingly handsome? While she was stuck with that balding, paunchy businessman who only knew how to throw money at problems?

"Vivian Hartley. Audrey Winslow." She seethed internally. "What makes them so damn special? Why do they get fairy tale endings while I'm stuck with some middle-aged wallet? Neither of them is anything special. So why them and not me?"

As the lively conversation continued, a shadow appeared in the doorway of the private room.
###Chapter 486

Victor Thornton had spent an excessive amount of time styling his hair that morning. The gel made his dark locks shine unnaturally under the chandelier lights, slicked back in a style that screamed midlife crisis. His attempt at youthfulness—a designer hoodie with playful graphic prints paired with distressed jeans—only accentuated the deep wrinkles around his eyes, creating a jarring contrast that bordered on comical.

Vivian's eyes traveled from Victor to Adrian Blackwood, who stood protectively beside her, then to Dominic Sinclair lounging near Audrey. On one side stood Victor, who could easily pass for her father's age, and on the other, men who looked like they'd walked straight off a Milan runway—all sharp jawlines and effortless charm. The disparity had never been more apparent.

Before tonight, Victor hadn't seemed so out of place. His old-money upbringing gave him an air of sophistication that set him apart from ordinary men. When Giselle had introduced him to her childhood friends, they'd whispered, "Your boyfriend looks like he belongs on Wall Street." Even boutique salesgirls would blush when helping him, something Giselle had always preened about.

Now, Giselle wished the marble floor would swallow her whole. She pressed herself against the wall, praying the shadows would conceal her. If only Victor would walk right past without noticing her presence.

One of the guests who recognized the Blackwood family connection was the first to break the tension. "Mr. Thornton!" he exclaimed a little too enthusiastically. "What a surprise! Giselle is right over there!"

Before Victor could turn toward Giselle, his gaze locked onto Adrian at the head table. His smile dissolved into a scowl. "Adrian," he said coldly, "what are you doing here?"

Adrian carefully selected a few canapés, arranging them delicately on Vivian's plate. "Try these, darling," he murmured. "The new pastry chef's work." Only after wiping his hands meticulously did he respond, "Attending my wife's reunion, Uncle. And you? Surely you didn't go to Crestwood Academy?"

Audrey leaned toward Dominic, whispering, "Adrian's being particularly vicious tonight."

Dominic smirked. "Your best friend's influence, no doubt."

The tension was palpable. Guests who'd been angling to cozy up to Victor suddenly found their plates fascinating, pretending not to notice the family drama unfolding.

Humiliated before the younger crowd, Victor slammed his leather portfolio onto the table with a loud thud. "Adrian Blackwood! I am your elder! Is this how the Blackwoods teach their heirs to behave? Where is your respect?"

Adrian traced the rim of his wine glass with one elegant finger. "Respect," he said softly, "isn't given. It's earned." His eyes lifted slowly, meeting Victor's glare. "Shall we ask Aunt Margaret to mediate? I'm sure she'd love to hear about your... extracurricular activities."

Victor's face turned ashen. His entire position at Blackwood Group depended on his wife's family connections. One word about his affair with Giselle, and his carefully constructed life would crumble.
###Chapter 487

Victor cleared his throat, attempting to ease the palpable tension in the room. "Since this is a reunion, I'll let you all enjoy yourselves. I have urgent matters at the Harbor Grand to attend to. We'll schedule another dinner soon."

Adrian's commanding presence silenced any potential objections. The private dining room fell into an oppressive quiet, broken only by the occasional clink of silverware against fine china.

Feeling the weight of everyone's stares, Victor adjusted his tie with stiff fingers before shooting an icy glare toward Giselle, who hovered near the curtains. "A word outside," he demanded through clenched teeth.

Giselle hesitated for only a heartbeat before pushing away from the wall. She could feel the burning curiosity of the guests as she followed Victor out, their whispers clinging to her like cobwebs.

The moment the door closed behind them, Victor's hand flashed out. The sharp slap echoed through the hallway, leaving Giselle's cheek flaming. Several servers froze mid-step, shocked by the public display of violence.

Inside, guests exchanged uneasy glances. But when they saw Adrian calmly serving Vivian her favorite dish without even looking up, they quickly returned to their meals, wisely choosing not to intervene.

Giselle pressed trembling fingers to her throbbing cheek. "How dare you?" she whispered furiously.

Victor leaned in, his breath hot against her ear. "Adrian Blackwood is here, and you dragged me into this mess? My wife was introduced through my sister. If this gets back to Margaret, do you have any idea what hell we'll both face?"

Tears spilled down Giselle's face. "I'm carrying your child! You think I knew Adrian would be here? Or that his wife was Vivian? You never tell me anything about your family!"

Victor's gaze dropped briefly to her stomach before he grabbed her chin roughly. "If not for this pregnancy, do you think I'd have touched you again? And let's be honest - how do I even know it's mine?"

After years of failed attempts to conceive a second child, medical tests had revealed Victor's low sperm motility. As the last Sinclair heir, the pressure to produce a male descendant weighed heavily on him.

Giselle wiped her mouth with the back of her hand, muttering "Pathetic worm" under her breath before spotting a polished serving tray. Using its reflection, she repaired her smudged makeup with practiced efficiency. Squaring her shoulders, she marched back into the dining room.

The atmosphere had shifted dramatically. Where there had once been envy and admiration, now only contempt and pity remained. The women who had fawned over her earlier now looked through her as if she were invisible.

Sitting down felt like lowering herself onto a bed of nails. Giselle had imagined herself ascending to greatness, like a swan among ducks. Instead, she'd become the evening's entertainment - a cautionary tale whispered behind raised hands.

Vivian exchanged a knowing look with Audrey. They'd caught enough of the argument to understand the situation perfectly. While neither woman sympathized with Giselle's schemes, Victor's brutality left a sour taste in their mouths.

The crystal chandelier above them seemed to dim as the uncomfortable meal continued, its light no longer glittering but glaring, exposing every strained smile and forced conversation. The reunion had become something else entirely - a theater of masks where everyone played their part while secretly counting the minutes until escape.
###Chapter 488

The silence stretched between them like a taut wire before Giselle whirled on Vivian with a venomous smirk. "Enjoying yourself, Vivian? Does my humiliation entertain you?"

It had all started with one drunken night at Mirage Lounge. Victor had never intended to sleep with Giselle, but the tequila had blurred his judgment. When she announced her pregnancy weeks later, his sudden attentiveness made sense - he only cared about the heir she might carry.

Giselle's face paled. "How dare you! There hasn't been anyone else since we got together! If you doubt me, we'll do a DNA test!"

Victor's laugh was ice. "Oh, we absolutely will. And we won't wait until birth. The moment we can determine the gender, we'll test." His implication hung heavy in the air - a daughter wouldn't be worth acknowledging.

Her stomach dropped. The charming man she'd fallen for now seemed like a stranger, his handsome features twisted with cruelty. He released her chin with a rough shove. "Stay out of sight this month. I have important matters to attend to. Reflect on your stupidity."

His mind already wandered to other women - more beautiful, more sophisticated. Giselle's dramatics and constant threats had trapped him longer than he'd wanted. This pregnancy mess provided the perfect escape route.

Pulling out his phone with a smirk, Victor headed for the elevator. Giselle didn't need to hear the call to know he was dialing his latest fling. The doors closed on his smug expression.

Vivian paused with her fork halfway to her mouth, genuinely perplexed. "Why would that make me happy?"

The innocent question struck Giselle like a physical blow. Vivian's tone held no malice, only sincere confusion - proof that Giselle's entire existence barely registered on her radar.

All these years, Giselle had nurtured this one-sided rivalry. Their chance encounter at Opal Galleria had only fueled her obsession. But to Vivian, she was nothing - just another face in the crowd.

In school, Vivian had been the golden girl - top of her class, effortlessly beautiful. Now she was a celebrity married to Adrian Blackwood, Crestwood's most powerful man. How could someone at those heights even see someone like Giselle, still scrambling in the dirt?

Defeated, Giselle slumped in her chair. The reunion dinner had taken an awkward turn. As plates were cleared, someone suggested karaoke - though everyone knew it was just an excuse to stay near Adrian and Dominic.

Vivian opened her mouth to decline when suddenly she gagged, hand flying to cover her mouth. Adrian was at her side instantly, his large hand rubbing soothing circles on her back. "What's wrong?" His voice held barely concealed panic.

She sipped some water, composing herself. "I'm fine." But the knowing glances exchanged around the table suggested otherwise.
###Chapter 489

The past few days had left my stomach unsettled. Tonight, I simply pushed myself too far.

My explanation seemed to satisfy everyone. They quickly backed off, offering kind words and urging me to rest.

As the group dispersed, Vivian, Adrian, Dominic, and Audrey made their way toward the elevator.

"I didn't drink tonight," Audrey said, glancing at Vivian. "I can drive you home."

Vivian smiled, her gaze flickering toward Dominic, who was noticeably tipsy. "Take Dominic instead. We'll arrange for a driver." Since the hotel belonged to the Blackwood Group, securing transportation was effortless.

Audrey hesitated briefly before nodding. She guided Dominic into the elevator.

Dominic slumped against her like a drunken scarf. "Kiss me," he mumbled, lips puckered.

Audrey rolled her eyes affectionately, ruffling his hair. "We're almost home. Be patient."

Vivian watched them disappear behind the closing elevator doors, a soft smile lingering on her lips. When she turned back, Adrian's gaze was fixed on her—intense and unwavering.

Caught in the moment, and perhaps emboldened by Audrey and Dominic's display of affection, Vivian stepped forward, rose onto her toes, and pressed a quick kiss to his cheek.

Before she could pull away, Adrian's arm snaked around her waist, pulling her flush against him. He tilted her chin up and captured her lips in a deeper, far more demanding kiss.

Vivian's eyes widened, and she pushed lightly against his chest. "We're in public," she murmured against his lips.

"No one's here," Adrian replied, his voice rough and low. His hands slid from her waist to her hips, holding her firmly in place.

Vivian flicked a glance toward the security camera in the hallway. "There's a camera," she pointed out.

"It's our hotel," he countered, entirely unbothered, his lips brushing the shell of her ear.

He pressed her gently against the wall, his movements growing bolder.

Vivian scanned the dimly lit hallway. The doors to the private rooms were open, the darkness inside confirming everyone had left.

Her tension eased, and she surrendered, responding to him with growing fervor.

Adrian knew every sensitive spot, expertly coaxing her into complete submission.

Her arms wound around his neck, and soon, her legs were wrapped around his waist. She clung to him, matching his intensity with her own.

Just a short distance away, Julian stepped out of the restroom.

The sight of them froze him in place. He stood there, unable to tear his eyes away.

###Chapter 490

The sight of such a typically composed woman surrendering so completely in that moment could only signify one undeniable truth. She was deeply in love.

Julian Montclair's chest constricted violently, his body recoiling instinctively as he retreated into the shadows.

His fingers found the edge of the marble counter, gripping the crystal diffuser with white-knuckled intensity. The pressure built as suppressed emotions erupted to the surface.

The diffuser exploded in his grasp, razor-sharp fragments embedding in his palm. Blood dripped steadily onto the pristine white porcelain, each crimson drop a stark contrast against the sterile background.

Yet Julian remained motionless. A bitter smile twisted his lips as he embraced the physical pain, using it to anchor his spiraling thoughts.

Time lost meaning until he witnessed Adrian Blackwood carrying Vivian Hartley into the elevator. Only then did Julian finally turn away.

Instead of returning to his empty penthouse, he found himself at the Mirage Lounge. As a regular patron, he typically visited for business meetings, never for personal indulgence. Tonight, however, the thought of solitude was unbearable.

Noticing Julian's distressed state, the club manager discreetly summoned an escort. The woman who entered wore a silver-gray dress that accentuated her statuesque figure, exuding an air of refined elegance. Her striking features held a quiet dignity, her intelligent eyes adding depth to her sophisticated beauty. She seemed the ideal companion for someone of Julian's caliber.

"Seraphina, ensure Mr. Montclair is well attended," the manager murmured before discreetly exiting.

When Seraphina's gaze fell upon Julian's striking profile, her breath caught. He reclined on the leather sofa, eyes closed, his aristocratic features relaxed yet radiating quiet intensity. There was an old-world charm about him, like a romantic hero stepped out of a classic novel.

In her line of work, clients were rarely of her choosing - mostly middle-aged businessmen with inflated egos. But Julian was different. His arresting looks and magnetic presence made her wonder if she'd pay for his company under different circumstances.

She settled beside him, uncorking a bottle of vintage Bordeaux. "Mr. Montclair," she ventured softly, "what troubles you tonight?"

Julian kept his eyes shut, willing his mind to quiet. But the image of Vivian locked in Adrian's embrace burned behind his eyelids. As he concentrated, the vision shifted - Adrian's face dissolving into his own.

Noticing his continued silence, Seraphina cautiously rested her hand on his thigh. "Perhaps I could help distract you?" she suggested, her fingers tracing light circles.

Julian's eyes snapped open, the earlier tranquility replaced by glacial intensity. The transformation was startling - the polished gentleman replaced by something far more dangerous.

Without warning, he seized her wrist with bruising force, his stormy gaze boring into hers with barely contained fury.

Though Seraphina bore no resemblance to Vivian, something in her calculated allure - that practiced coldness turned seductive - ignited Julian's simmering resentment. Where Vivian used her reserve as armor, this woman wielded hers as a weapon.
###Chapter 491

The realization turned his stomach. Vivian would never act this way. She always kept her boundaries, recoiling at the slightest hint of impropriety. Even if this woman shared some superficial resemblance to Vivian, her crude behavior felt like a desecration of Vivian's memory.

Seraphina trembled as she tried to pull her wrist free, her voice shaking. "Mr. Montclair, you're hurting me."

Julian didn't respond, his fingers tightening like steel bands around her delicate wrist. Seraphina bit her lip against the pain, knowing better than to resist.

With her other hand, she lifted the champagne flute toward him. "Mr. Montclair, please, have a drink."

After a tense moment, Julian finally released her, leaning back into the plush sofa with an icy dismissal. "Leave."

Not ready to surrender such a lucrative client, Seraphina persisted, glass still extended. "Mr. Montclair, what don't you like about me? My dress? I can change—maybe silk stockings? Or a schoolgirl uniform? Just tell me your preference."

As she spoke, her fingers flew to the clasp at her throat, letting the fabric part to reveal a scandalous amount of cleavage.

Julian's restraint shattered. He snatched the champagne flute and upended it over her perfectly styled hair without hesitation.

As the golden liquid streamed down her face, he said through clenched teeth, "I have standards."

Tears welled in Seraphina's eyes, humiliation burning her cheeks. During her years at the Mirage Lounge, she'd entertained society's elite. Even the most debauched patrons maintained superficial courtesy.

But never had anyone called her "beneath them" so bluntly. The insult cut deeper than any physical pain.

In Julian's universe, there were only two categories: Vivian Hartley, and everyone else.

Seraphina, accustomed to bending men to her will with a pout or a tearful glance, found her usual tactics useless against Julian's glacial indifference.

Defeated, she gathered what remained of her dignity. Rising on unsteady legs, she exited without another word, the sharp click of her Louboutins echoing in the tense silence.

As the door closed behind her, a bitter thought took root: Those lecherous old bankers at least knew how to appreciate a woman's charms. Compared to Julian Montclair, they suddenly seemed almost... respectable.

The manager pacing outside nearly tripped when he saw Seraphina emerge, her designer dress ruined by champagne. "Seraphina! What did you do to anger Mr. Montclair?"

Julian Montclair wasn't just any client. The manager both revered and feared him.

During Julian's first visit to the Mirage Lounge, he'd arrived with a group of foreign businessmen bearing identical raven tattoos on their necks. The manager hadn't recognized the symbol initially—until a regular whispered that it marked members of the infamous Obsidian Syndicate. In their world, that kind of association only meant one thing: danger.
###Chapter 492

Working at Mirage Lounge meant navigating a sea of personalities, each requiring a different approach. And Julian Montclair wasn't just another client.

His commanding presence, powerful connections, and that dangerous aura demanded absolute precision in every interaction.

The manager signaled for Seraphina to exit immediately, desperate to avoid further provoking Julian. Drawing a steadying breath, he pushed open the private room's door.

Inside, Julian lounged with predatory grace, his piercing gaze dissecting the room.

"Mr. Montclair," the manager began with a nervous bow. "Seraphina is still learning. Any offense was unintentional. I sincerely apologize. If you'd prefer another companion—"

Donovan Pierce, Julian's sharply dressed assistant, cut him off. "Unnecessary," he stated coldly. "Your services aren't required here."

Turning to Julian, Donovan lowered his voice. "Sir, your car is ready whenever you wish to leave."

The manager nodded hastily, already retreating.

"One more thing," Donovan's voice froze him mid-step.

"Yes, sir?" The manager's pulse hammered in his throat.

Donovan's words carried glacial finality. "When Mr. Montclair visits alone, ensure no female staff enter his suite. Understood?"

"Absolutely, sir. It won't happen again." Beads of sweat formed along his hairline as he backed away.

An outrageous suspicion suddenly struck him. If Julian refused female company... did that mean he favored—

The thought nearly made him stumble.

Julian Montclair, that paragon of masculine elegance, might have such unconventional tastes?

"Rich men always have their eccentricities," he muttered, shaking his head as he fled.

Julian stretched across the leather couch, his expression inscrutable. His fingers twitched toward a crystal glass, but Donovan was already there, pouring amber liquid with both hands.

Instead, Julian seized the whiskey bottle directly. Tipping his head back, he drained a third of the contents before letting it shatter against the marble floor. He watched the spreading pool with detached interest.

"Find me an underground fight ring," he commanded, rolling his shoulders to release tension.

Meanwhile, Adrian Blackwood guided Vivian Hartley into the penthouse suite of Harbor Grand Hotel. Her cheeks bloomed pink, eyes shining with vulnerable trust as she gazed up at him—a delicate blossom trembling in the wind.

Adrian's blood burned. That fragile beauty, that unconscious surrender in her gaze, only stoked his hunger to claim her completely.

The door clicked shut. In one fluid motion, Adrian pinned Vivian against it, capturing her lips in a searing kiss. His hand found the delicate column of her throat, fingers tracing the flutter of her pulse before tightening possessively.
###Chapter 493

Vivian's vision swam as oxygen deprivation made her dizzy, yet an intoxicating pleasure coursed through her veins between gasps for air. Adrian had taken her twice, only stopping when he recalled her earlier complaint about nausea. Afterward, he'd tenderly cleaned her up and cocooned her in the plush hotel bedding.

From her nest of blankets, Vivian tracked his movements through half-lidded eyes. When he caught her watching, Adrian muted his microphone and murmured, "Rest now, darling. I've got this investor call."

Her hand shot out from the covers, fingers curling around his wrist. "Don't go," she whispered.

With a sigh, Adrian flipped his laptop camera off and settled against the headboard beside her. Vivian immediately curled against his side, idly toying with the silk tie of his lounging pants.

Meanwhile at the underground fight club...

A masked figure stood like a specter in the blood-splattered ring, his white shirt stained crimson. Even those familiar with Julian Montclair couldn't reconcile this brutal fighter with the sophisticated businessman they knew. The man at his feet - a mountain of muscle now twitching in its death throes - finally stilled beneath the arena lights.

The club physician checked for a pulse before shaking his head. "Gone."

Julian didn't glance at the corpse. "Wire three hundred thousand to his next of kin," he instructed his assistant, wiping sweat from his brow with a bloodied hand.

While death wasn't uncommon in these illicit matches, tonight's audience of thrill-seeking tourists froze in horror. The way Julian had systematically dismantled his opponent - each calculated strike more vicious than the last - left them paralyzed with fear.

Backstage, Julian peeled off his mask and changed into a crisp dress shirt. His assistant gasped upon noticing the gash on his forearm. "Sir, you need medical attention."

Julian examined the wound absently. He remembered the exact moment it happened - when he'd smashed the other fighter's face into the mat for the fifth time. Bone had shattered beneath his knuckles, spraying vitreous fluid across his sleeve. The dying man's desperate clawing had left this mark.

A perverse idea struck him. Seizing a pair of surgical scissors from the dressing table, Julian deliberately reopened the wound, watching blood well up with grim satisfaction. This would get her attention.

"Wait," he called as his assistant turned to leave. "Take me to St. Mary's. Then inform Vivian Hartley."

He needed to know - would she remain curled around her precious Adrian, or come running when she heard he was bleeding?

Back at the Harbor Grand...

Adrian typed furiously during the video conference, his focus absolute. Vivian scrolled mindlessly through her phone until an unknown number flashed across the screen. Her thumb hovered over the answer button as ice slithered down her spine.
###Chapter 494

Vivian hesitated, glancing at her buzzing phone in the dim hotel room. Who could be calling at this ungodly hour? She bit her lower lip thoughtfully before swiping to answer, her pulse quickening with anticipation.

"Ms. Hartley?" A professional male voice inquired through the receiver.

"Yes, speaking." Her response came sharper than intended, laced with sleep and curiosity.

The caller continued smoothly, "I'm calling regarding Mr. Julian Montclair. He sustained injuries while assisting an elderly woman and is currently at Crestwood General. We require immediate payment for his treatment—"

Before he could finish, Vivian threw back the silk sheets, her bare feet hitting the plush carpet. "Text me the address. I'll be there within the hour."

She ended the call and grabbed Adrian's discarded dress shirt from the armchair, heading toward the ensuite bathroom.

Adrian removed his wireless earbuds, his piercing gaze following her movements. "What's the emergency?"

Vivian squeezed minty toothpaste onto her brush, speaking around the bristles. "Hospital run. And order us some fresh clothes from the concierge, would you?"

Adrian set aside his tablet and stalked toward the bathroom doorway, his muscular frame blocking most of the light. "Who needs medical attention at four in the morning?"

Spitting into the sink, Vivian emerged with a damp face, hastily drying it with a towel. "Julian. Apparently he played hero for some stranger. I'm covering his bills."

Adrian's sculpted eyebrows shot up, disbelief twisting his handsome features. "Julian Montclair? Helping strangers?" A sardonic chuckle escaped his lips. "The man has a personal staff of twelve. Why does this responsibility fall to you?"

The doorbell chimed. Vivian strode past him, tossing over her shoulder, "You know how private he is about family matters. The nurse said it's serious—broken ribs at least. We went to university together, Adrian. It's basic human decency."

A uniformed attendant entered with an armful of garment bags. Vivian selected a fitted black turtleneck and tailored taupe trousers from the selection, her movements efficient.

Adrian sank onto the velvet sofa, watching her through hooded eyes. "So you're abandoning me in this five-star prison to play Florence Nightingale?"

Vivian peeled off her sleep shirt without hesitation, meeting his gaze defiantly in her lace bralette. "Who said you can't come? Unless you have more important things to do than chaperone me to a hospital."

His stormy eyes traced the fading love bites along her collarbone before he abruptly looked away, grabbing a charcoal henley and dark jeans. With exaggerated resignation, he sighed, "Fine. But I'm driving."

As she fastened her watch, Vivian muttered, "Honestly, what was he thinking? A man who wears thousand-dollar suits shouldn't be playing Good Samaritan in back alleys."

Adrian paused at the bathroom threshold, his voice dripping with irony. "Sweetheart, you clearly don't know Julian Montclair at all."

Dawn painted the sky in pale watercolors when they arrived at Crestwood General. The sterile hospital lights revealed Julian sitting alone on an emergency room bench, his usually impeccable appearance disheveled. The harsh fluorescence accentuated the shadows under his eyes and the blood staining his once-pristine white shirt, making the aristocratic man look startlingly vulnerable.
###Chapter 495

Adrian moved toward the window to settle the bill, but Vivian caught his sleeve with delicate fingers. "Let me check on him first," she murmured, her voice like morning dew.

Adrian gave her a fleeting glance, his expression unreadable. "What's there to check? He's just sitting there."

Vivian's eyes widened before she playfully swatted his arm. "That's your nephew you're talking about. Show some concern!"

Adrian pressed his tongue against his cheek, the ghost of a smirk disappearing as quickly as it came. He didn't protest.

With her hands buried in the oversized pockets of her sweatshirt, looking almost adolescent, Vivian approached Julian. "Julian," she called softly.

He lifted his head, his complexion alarmingly pale, lips nearly colorless. Despite obvious exhaustion, he managed a faint smile. "Vivian, I apologize for disturbing you so late."

Vivian's brow furrowed with gentle reproach. "Julian, if you keep being this formal with me, I'll start thinking you don't consider me family."

She produced a small thermos from her pocket. "Ginger and honey tea. Picked it up from that all-night café near the studio. Kept it warm against my body."

Julian hesitated, his hand suspended midair. "I don't usually drink—"

"Doesn't matter what you usually do," Vivian interrupted, her tone firm yet tender. "You're white as hospital sheets." Her gaze dropped to his bandaged forearm where crimson blossoms marred the sterile gauze.

Reluctantly, Julian accepted the container with his uninjured hand. Vivian leaned in to unscrew the lid, her chestnut waves brushing his cheek. The delicate fragrance of jasmine from her hair enveloped him—fresh yet sophisticated, much like the woman herself.

Up close, Julian noticed a faint love bite peeking from behind Vivian's ear. His throat constricted as memories of her locked in Adrian's embrace flooded his mind, leaving a bitter aftertaste.

Vivian settled beside him, careful of his injury. "How bad is it really?" she asked, tilting her head.

Julian shrugged. "Papercut. Got too close to an overenthusiastic fan with sharp nails."

Before Vivian could reply, a nurse emerged from the treatment area. "Papercut?" she scoffed. "The muscle was visible—took fifty-three stitches. Keep it dry in this heat or you'll be back with sepsis."

Vivian nodded earnestly. "Thank you, we'll make sure he follows instructions."

The nurse smiled at Vivian. "Listen to your girlfriend. She clearly cares about you."

Vivian froze, mouth slightly parted. Before she could clarify, Adrian materialized behind her, his arm snaking around her waist. "Misunderstanding," he stated coolly. "She's my fiancée. This is our nephew."
###Chapter 496

"Oh?" The nurse blinked between Adrian and Julian, her cheeks turning pink with embarrassment. "My apologies! I didn't realize. How awkward." She scurried away, muttering under her breath.

Julian stayed silent, his dark eyes flashing with unreadable emotions as Adrian approached. "All taken care of," Adrian said smoothly, deliberately ignoring the tension in Julian's posture. He pulled a receipt from his pocket and tucked it into Julian's shirt. "You can repay me later."

Vivian turned to Adrian, forcing lightness into her voice. "Let's get Julian something to eat before we take him home."

"He looks like he hasn't had a proper meal in weeks," Vivian added, reaching to pinch Adrian's hand playfully. But he caught her wrist firmly, his grip unyielding. His eyes turned icy as he said, "Your friend Audrey is waiting at Seabreeze Villa. Ethan will drive you home now."

Vivian frowned. "Audrey? How did she end up at our house?" She checked her phone, but there were no messages from Audrey.

Adrian's jaw clenched as he kept his tone measured. "How should I know? She's always full of surprises. Maybe her battery died."

Vivian studied him skeptically. His explanation sounded plausible, but something about his controlled demeanor set her on edge.

After a beat, she turned back to Julian with concern. "What about Julian?"

Adrian's response came instantly, calm but edged with annoyance. "I'll make sure he gets home safely. I may not like him, but I'm not heartless."

Vivian hesitated. "But—"

Adrian's patience snapped. "But what? When I got hurt protecting you, it was far worse than this. You didn't fuss over me like this."

Vivian recoiled at his words. She opened her mouth to argue, but seeing Julian's composed expression, she bit back her retort. Instead, she rattled off instructions. "Fine. But be gentle with his injured arm. Get him proper food. Help him clean up, and keep his bandages dry."

Adrian tilted his head, his smile mocking. "I'm not his personal attendant. He has staff for that."

Turning to Julian, Vivian softened her voice. "I'll check on you tomorrow, okay?"

Julian leaned against the wall, offering a faint smile. "Don't trouble yourself, Vivian. It's just a scratch. I'll manage." His tone was polite, almost detached. "Besides, I wouldn't want to interrupt your schedule. We all have our own lives, and this isn't worth your concern. In this condition, I wouldn't be very good company anyway."

Adrian's expression darkened, Julian's reasonable words only fueling his irritation. Earlier at Harbor Grand Hotel, Adrian had been certain Julian's injury was no accident—another one of his calculated plays.

Just then, Ethan appeared, his steps brisk. He nodded respectfully. "Mr. Blackwood, Mrs. Blackwood, Mr. Montclair."

Adrian gestured dismissively. "Ethan, take Mrs. Blackwood back to Seabreeze Villa."
###Chapter 497

Adrian's piercing gaze darted toward Julian before locking back onto Kristopher. "And Mr. Montclair?"

"I'll see him home and return afterward," Adrian replied tersely.

"Very well," Ethan said with a slight nod before turning to Vivian. "Mrs. Blackwood, right this way." Vivian bid a hasty farewell to Julian and followed Ethan to the waiting limousine.

Through the hospital corridor windows, Adrian waited until he saw Vivian safely enter the vehicle and watched it disappear down the tree-lined boulevard. Only then did he turn back to Julian, his entire demeanor shifting like quicksilver. "What game are you playing now?"

Adrian's voice cut through the sterile hospital air like a blade, every trace of warmth evaporating from his chiseled features.

"Accusing me again?" Julian lifted his bandaged hand slightly, offering a crooked smile that didn't reach his eyes. "I'm injured. Wallet's empty. Can't a man ask an old friend for help?"

"Spare me the act," Adrian snapped. His voice dripped with venom as his obsidian eyes narrowed to slits. "Vivian might buy your charming facade, but I know better. With you, not making situations worse is practically a humanitarian effort."

Julian let his hand drop, his posture deceptively relaxed. "Your lack of faith is your problem, not mine."

Adrian's control snapped. Without warning, his fist connected with Julian's jaw in a brutal arc. The impact sent Julian crashing against the hospital wall before sliding to the floor.

Wiping blood from his split lip with the back of his hand, Julian looked up with eerie calm. His pale face remained impassive, but something dangerous glittered in his dark eyes. "Still quick to violence, I see. What would Vivian think of her perfect husband now?"

Adrian closed the distance in two strides, hauling Julian up by his designer shirt collar. He delivered another punishing blow, this time sending Julian's head snapping sideways. "What's your endgame?" Adrian growled, his voice a lethal whisper. "Do you actually care about her, or are you just determined to drag her into your personal hell?"

For a heartbeat, their gazes locked—two predators sizing each other up—before identical, humorless smiles curved their lips.

Julian spat a mouthful of blood onto the pristine hospital tiles.

Then chaos erupted.

Julian's fist shot toward Adrian's temple with deadly precision, every movement calculated to incapacitate. But Adrian anticipated the attack, releasing Julian's collar and pivoting with fluid grace. Julian's knuckles barely grazed Adrian's forearm—where they connected, the impact would have shattered bone in a lesser man.

Adrian straightened his tailored jacket with deliberate calm, brushing imaginary lint from the sleeves. His movements were controlled, predatory.

Julian wasn't surprised. He'd heard the whispered legends—how mercenaries across three continents spoke Adrian Blackwood's name with reverence and fear. Now he understood why.

Rising smoothly, Julian adjusted his rumpled shirt as if their violent exchange had been nothing more than a casual conversation. His smirk returned, though blood still trickled from his lip. "Pot calling the kettle black, aren't we? They say you're the devil himself in Savile Row tailoring. Your world must be fascinating."

Adrian's glacial stare could have frozen lava. "Don't equate us. I have lines I won't cross."

The unspoken words hung between them like drawn swords: And you never did.
###Chapter 498

Julian Montclair eased himself into the nearest chair with deliberate slowness, his movements deceptively casual despite the crimson stain spreading across his sleeve where the wound had reopened.

The white bandage darkened with fresh blood as he adjusted his position. "Enough with the meaningless banter," he said, flicking his uninjured hand dismissively. "We're both bleeding here - neither holds the moral high ground."

His gaze turned razor-sharp as it locked onto Adrian. "You know what disgusts me about you, Blackwood? We're cut from the same cloth, yet you parade around like some untouchable saint." A bitter laugh escaped his lips. "You weren't always this virtuous. Need I remind you who really killed your sister?"

The words barely left his mouth before Adrian's foot connected with a nearby bench. Where his previous punches had been restrained, this kick held nothing back. The heavy wooden bench screeched across the polished floor, leaving a jagged scar in the linoleum.

Julian hissed as pain exploded through his chest - definitely a broken rib - yet his smirk never wavered. "That guilt eating at you? The truth you've buried so deep is finally surfacing."

Flames of intensity burned in his eyes as he continued, "If you hadn't severed ties with my family years ago, I wouldn't have been forced to study abroad. Vivian and I could have been together by now. I knew her long before you ever darkened her doorstep." He wiped blood from his lip. "We both crawled out of the same darkness, Adrian. Of course we'd both be drawn to someone like Vivian - her light's impossible to ignore. But you had her and threw her away. If you two ever split again, remember this conversation. I'll make sure she comes back to me."

Adrian's scoff was ice-cold. "Don't project your filth onto me. However complicated my past may be, I'll never let Vivian be tainted by it. She'll always be protected from that world."

Adrian rose to his full height, the overhead lights casting half his face in shadow, accentuating the sharp angles of his features.

Julian's mocking laugh turned into a pained cough. He pressed a hand to his ribs but continued, "Yet you're the one hurting her most. All for Serena. What hold does that witch have over you that you'd go to such lengths?"

Adrian's gaze could have frozen hell over. "That's none of your business."

"Some graves are better left unopened. Push further, and I'll personally escort your entire family to the afterlife."

The nurse who'd stepped out earlier burst back into the room, her gasp audible as she took in Julian's blood-soaked state. "Dear God! What happened here?"

Julian's vision tunneled to black as his body finally gave out, collapsing onto the sterile hospital floor in an ungainly heap.

Adrian spared one last glacial look at the scene before striding toward the exit. Outside, he pulled out his phone and sent a voice message to Vivian: "He's been dealt with. Want me to pick up anything for you on my way back?"

When Vivian returned home, the mansion was immaculate - no signs of disturbance. The housekeeper had clearly retired for the night. She turned to study Ethan Caldwell, who immediately averted his eyes, shoulders tense. His guilt was written plainly across his face.

"Mrs. Blackwood, it's getting late. I should head home," he mumbled before practically bolting out the door.

Vivian watched as Ethan's car peeled away into the night, taillights disappearing around the bend. She didn't bother calling Audrey for confirmation. She wasn't foolish - this reeked of Adrian's classic misdirection tactics.
###Chapter 499

To her surprise, Vivian didn't feel angry at all. She completely understood why Adrian would be jealous when she went out to meet Julian Montclair in the middle of the night.

Stretching her arms, she slipped her feet into plush velvet slippers and made her way upstairs. The day had drained every ounce of her energy, and now fatigue crashed over her like a tidal wave. Secretly, she was grateful Adrian had tricked her into coming home early. At least now she could finally collapse into bed.

She changed into silk pajamas, slid beneath the satin sheets, and fell into a dreamless sleep almost instantly.

When Adrian returned, the mansion was bathed in golden light from strategically placed lamps. The warm glow created an inviting atmosphere despite the late hour. He'd always preferred cooler, more clinical lighting - but Vivian had insisted warm tones made their house feel lived-in.

Now, returning at this ungodly hour, he appreciated her choice. He carried a takeout box of Vivian's favorite late-night comfort food upstairs.

Pushing open the bedroom door, he found the bedside lamp still glowing, illuminating Vivian's sleeping form curled under the duvet. A faint smile touched his lips. Normally Vivian couldn't sleep with any lights on. She must have been completely exhausted.

The faint coppery scent of blood clung stubbornly to his leather jacket. Though the dark material hid any stains, the metallic tang lingered in the air.

Adrian placed the food container on the nightstand and headed straight for the ensuite bathroom. After scrubbing away the day's events under scalding water, he changed into fresh sleepwear. He considered discarding the jacket but remembered it was part of a set Vivian had lovingly picked out. Instead, he buried it at the bottom of the hamper, covering it with a bathrobe for good measure. Satisfied, he emerged from the bathroom.

The sound of the door clicking shut stirred Vivian from sleep. She blinked up at him with heavy-lidded eyes, her expression soft with lingering drowsiness.

Adrian approached, retrieving the takeout box before perching on the edge of their king-sized bed. Vivian's hand slipped out from under the covers to brush against his. Her fingers were warm and delicate against his skin, grounding him in the present.

"Want to keep sleeping or have a midnight snack?" he murmured, his voice low.

"What'd you bring?" Vivian's words came out thick with sleep, the question ending in a sleepy little whimper.

He tested the temperature of the container before opening it. "Those crispy chicken wings from that place you love near the studio."

The rich aroma of perfectly fried chicken filled the air between them. Vivian's stomach betrayed her with an audible growl. She gave an embarrassed chuckle, pushing herself up against the tufted headboard. "Just a couple bites."

Adrian selected the plumpest wing and offered it to her. Vivian hesitated for a heartbeat.

In the past, she would have taken the food and eaten it herself, maintaining careful boundaries even in their most intimate moments. But their relationship had evolved - she'd learned that love wasn't about independence, but interdependence. These small acts of care were the threads weaving their lives together.

She leaned forward to take a delicate bite, her gaze lingering on Adrian's sharp jawline. "Perfect," she murmured, her lips curving into a genuine smile.

Seeing her pleasure sent unexpected warmth spreading through Adrian's chest. For the first time, he understood that caring for someone wasn't an obligation - it could be profoundly fulfilling. He brought the chicken to her lips again, coaxing her to take another bite.
###Chapter 500

Vivian took two more delicate bites before leaning back with a satisfied sigh, rubbing her stomach. "I'm completely stuffed. Such a shame to waste this."

Without missing a beat, Adrian picked up the half-eaten drumstick and took a generous bite of her leftovers.

Vivian's breath caught in her throat. Adrian—the man who insisted on separate towels for hands and face, who alphabetized his spice rack—was casually finishing her meal without hesitation. It wasn't the action itself that shocked her, but the profound intimacy it represented. This simple act felt more vulnerable than any passionate embrace they'd shared.

It spoke of unspoken trust and devotion—something Vivian had always struggled to give or receive. Even parents stopped eating their children's leftovers once they grew past toddler age.

When Adrian finished, Vivian rested her head against his thigh and gazed up at him with sleepy eyes. "I need to brush my teeth."

Her bedtime rituals were non-negotiable—pitch darkness, absolute silence, the thermostat set precisely to 68°F, weighted blankets, and only 800-thread-count Egyptian cotton sheets. The faintest hint of food residue in her mouth would keep her awake all night.

Adrian set the empty wonton bowl aside. "Shall I carry you to the bathroom?"

Vivian pouted adorably. "No, I don't want to move. Can't I just brush here in bed?"

Adrian stood immediately. "Stay put."

He meticulously wiped down the nightstand with a disinfectant cloth, cracked the window to circulate fresh air, and disposed of their takeout containers.

Vivian watched fondly as he performed these domestic routines. Once the trash was taken out, Adrian returned to their ensuite bathroom.

Moments later, he reappeared carrying a porcelain basin. Inside rested a crystal water glass and her favorite electric toothbrush, already loaded with her preferred mint toothpaste.

Vivian sat up and began brushing lazily, taking exaggerated swishes of water between strokes. When she finished, Adrian produced a warm washcloth and tenderly dabbed away the toothpaste traces from her lips.

Content, Vivian burrowed back under the covers. Adrian cleaned up efficiently, killed the lights, and slid in beside her. He cocooned them both in the duvet, pulling her petite frame snugly against his chest.

The next morning, Vivian awoke to an unexpected floral fragrance permeating the air.

Her eyes flew open to discover an extravagant bouquet propped against her nightstand. Towering stems of rare indigo Manta roses stretched nearly a meter high, their smoky violet petals unfurling dramatically. It was the exact viral "candy stick" arrangement she'd admired yesterday while scrolling through social media.

She'd casually mentioned to Adrian, "Now this is what a proper romantic gesture looks like." Never in her wildest dreams did she imagine he'd race out at dawn to procure this specific trending bouquet.

Compared to the six-carat diamond earrings or couture gowns in her closet, these flowers seemed modest. Yet the thoughtful execution—remembering her offhand comment and acting on it—sent her heart soaring. Any lingering sleepiness evaporated as pure joy bubbled up inside her. This surprise set the tone for what promised to be a magical day.
###Chapter 501

The morning sunlight streamed through the curtains as Vivian stretched her arms above her head. She kicked off the silk sheets, her bare feet sinking into the plush carpet. The soft fibers tickled her toes, bringing an unexpected smile to her face.

Her eyes scanned the bedroom until they landed on a forgotten treasure - an ornate crystal vase tucked away in the cabinet. The handcrafted piece caught the light, refracting rainbow prisms across the walls. Perfect for the roses.

Vivian filled the vase with fresh water, carefully unwrapping the bouquet. Each stem found its place in the arrangement, the vibrant red blooms glowing like embers in the morning light. She was admiring her handiwork when her phone buzzed.

It was Damien Vaughn, summoning her to an unexpected promotional event. She touched her cheek absently - the ointment had worked wonders overnight, erasing all traces of yesterday's irritation.

She chose an emerald green halter dress with daring cutouts that accentuated her waist. Delicate pearl pins held back her cascading waves, while ornate ear cuffs graced her lobes. A gift from Ethan, specially designed since she'd never gotten her ears pierced.

The venue was already packed when she arrived. To her astonishment, a group of fans waved handmade signs with her name. Her first real fan encounter sent warmth spreading through her chest. These strangers had come just for her.

Before the event began, she posed for photos and signed autographs. Noticing their flushed faces in the summer heat, she surprised them with iced matcha lattes. Unbeknownst to her, the gesture would soon trend on social media as #ViviansMatchaMagic.

The Ambermyst promotional event was Ivory Phoenix Productions' latest extravaganza. Interactive stations let fans experience key scenes while Q&A sessions revealed behind-the-scenes secrets. The energy was electric, but exhausting.

Hours later, her feet screamed in protest. These stilettos weren't the comfortable wedges she'd worn during university lectures. She discreetly slipped backstage, kicking off her shoes with a relieved sigh.

The lounge smelled rancid - someone's abandoned takeout congealing in its container. The greasy odor clung to the air, turning her stomach. Before she could react, she was clutching a trash can, heaving up nothing but bile.

When she looked up, Serena Whitmore stood frozen in the doorway. The usually provocative socialite wore an uncharacteristically blank expression. Dressed in virginal white, she seemed almost... human.

Vivian remembered seeing Serena's name on a boutique opening schedule for this very mall. The universe had a twisted sense of humor, constantly throwing them together.

Turning away, Vivian grabbed a water bottle to rinse her mouth. She hadn't eaten much anyway - with Adrian away, she'd barely touched breakfast before rushing out. Now her empty stomach protested both hunger and nausea simultaneously.

The intercom crackled, summoning her back to the event. She squared her shoulders, slipping her aching feet back into the torture devices masquerading as shoes. The show, as they say, must go on.
###Chapter 502

Vivian set the water bottle down with trembling fingers, smoothing her dress with deliberate movements. Serena still lingered by the door, her gaze piercing like shards of ice. The air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

"Are you going to stand there all day?" Vivian arched an eyebrow, her voice laced with quiet challenge.

Serena stepped forward, her designer heels clicking sharply against the marble floor. "Morning sickness?" she demanded without preamble. "Tell me you're not pregnant with Adrian's child."

The words hit Vivian like a physical blow. She'd been pushing the thought away for days - the nausea, the fatigue, the strange metallic taste in her mouth. But hearing it voiced aloud made the possibility terrifyingly real.

"That's rich," Vivian countered, forcing a laugh that sounded hollow even to her own ears. "Coming from the woman who couldn't even get him to touch her." She saw the barb land as Serena's perfect composure fractured for just an instant.

Serena's manicured nails dug crescent moons into her palms. "He loved me first," she hissed. "He'll always love me."

Vivian slipped her shoes back on with deliberate slowness. "Love is such a fickle thing, isn't it?" She tilted her head, letting her hair fall in a golden curtain. "Funny how he's the one sharing my bed every night. Tell me, Serena - does it keep you up at night? Wondering what we're doing while you're alone in that penthouse he bought you?"

The ribbon-cutting ceremony loomed ahead, an opportunity Vivian couldn't afford to miss. She needed allies now more than ever, especially with Adrian's attention divided between business in Silverpine and whatever twisted game he was playing with Serena.

"Move," Vivian commanded, brushing past her rival with deliberate casualness. The scent of Serena's expensive perfume - something floral and cloying - made her stomach churn again.

Hours later, in the pristine bathroom of Opal Galleria, Vivian stared at the plastic stick in her shaking hands. The faint second line mocked her, a whisper of possibility that could unravel everything. She googled frantically, her breath coming in short gasps as the search results confirmed her worst fear.

Early pregnancy.

The words blurred before her eyes as the weight of their meaning settled over her like a shroud.
###Chapter 503

Vivian's mind went completely blank. The realization that she might be carrying a child left her frozen in disbelief.

She studied her reflection in the boutique's restroom mirror, fingers trembling as they hovered over her still-flat abdomen. Could this tiny space inside her really hold Adrian's baby? Their baby?

She'd always heard love-conceived children grew up happier, more resilient.

Exiting the stall felt like wading through molasses, each step requiring conscious effort.

Near the mall's grand entrance, a pastel-colored baby boutique caught her attention like a magnet. Before she realized it, her feet had carried her inside.

What Vivian didn't see was the adjacent stall door creaking open moments after she left. Bianca emerged, sharp eyes scanning the empty restroom before zeroing in on the trash bin.

Spotting the discarded pregnancy test, she hesitated only a second before fishing it out with a tissue. The two pink lines made her breath hitch.

Fumbling with her phone, Bianca captured multiple angles of the damning evidence before stuffing it back and rushing out, mind already spinning with possibilities.

Vivian Hartley - pregnant!

The Thornton family had been in chaos since Adrian severed ties over Vivian. Her parents' constant fighting had turned their mansion into a battleground, with her father disappearing for days after each explosive argument.

The final insult? Dominic - her longtime crush - was now dating Audrey, Vivian's closest friend.

Bianca's nails dug into her palms. Everything wrong in her life traced back to Vivian. The family disgrace, her ruined romantic prospects, the gnawing bitterness - all Vivian's doing.

And now this pregnancy? An heir for Adrian Blackwood? Unacceptable. If Vivian delivered this child, her position as Mrs. Blackwood would become unshakable.

Bianca swore silently. Vivian would pay - dearly - for every ounce of her suffering.

Inside the boutique, cheerful murals and plush toys surrounded Vivian. There was a time she'd dreamed of motherhood, but life's harsh lessons had buried that fantasy deep.

Now, gazing at tiny booties and pastel mobiles, that long-forgotten yearning surfaced with startling intensity.

Adjusting her designer sunglasses, she feigned casual browsing.

"Looking for a gift, miss?" A sales associate approached, taking in Vivian's fashionable ensemble.

"Yes," Vivian lied smoothly, forcing a smile. "Just browsing for now."

The test could be wrong. Early results weren't always reliable. Until confirmed by a doctor, there was no point panicking - or getting hopeful. This secret would remain hers alone.
###Chapter 504

The morning sickness had been impossible to hide. Serena had already commented on it with that knowing look in her eyes.

The boutique clerk's face lit up. "Do we know if it's a little prince or princess? I'd love to suggest some perfect items."

"Prince or princess?"

If a boy, he'd be thrust into the Blackwood dynasty's ruthless succession battles. Vivian knew all too well the gilded cage of generational wealth - every privilege came shackled with obligations. She wanted no part of that legacy for her child. The Blackwood empire demanded too high a price.

But a daughter... With the family's resources, she could carve her own path. Maybe pink booties wouldn't be such a bad choice after all.

"Madam?" The clerk's voice pulled Vivian from her thoughts.

She offered a distracted smile. "It's too early to tell the gender."

"Not to worry!" The clerk chirped, pulling out neutral-toned onesies. "These modern designs work beautifully for either. Look at this organic cotton - so soft against delicate skin."

Vivian's fingers lingered on a blush-pink romper with tiny embroidered stars. The image flashed unbidden - Adrian's stern features softening as he cradled a giggling baby in that ridiculous outfit. The contrast would be downright adorable.

As she exited with her pastel-wrapped parcels, Audrey's call came through.

"Viv! You'll never guess - Giselle's been outed to Victor's wife!"

Vivian nearly dropped her phone. "How?"

"Who knows?" Audrey crunched loudly on something. "This crowd licks boots and stabs backs before breakfast. Since Adrian made his... feelings about Uncle Victor quite clear at the gala..."

A pause for dramatic swallowing. "Frankly, I'll be shocked if that 'royal bastard' makes it to term."

Vivian's grip tightened on her shopping bags. "Giselle will blame us."

Audrey snorted. "And? It's not like I can conjure her a replacement heir. Even if I wanted to - which I don't. My uterus is a no-baby zone."

The call cut off abruptly - no doubt Dominic's arrival. But Audrey's careless words lingered like poison.

For the first time, Vivian felt true fear coiling in her gut. Her hand moved protectively over the barely-there swell. This tiny life was her one irreplaceable vulnerability now.

As she hailed a cab, Adrian's name flashed on her screen. The timing couldn't be more perfect - or more terrifying.
###Chapter 505

The deep timbre of his voice instantly melted the tension coiled in her chest. "All done?" Adrian's words flowed like warm honey through the phone. Vivian realized with a start that she hadn't checked her messages since texting him before the event.

Sliding into the backseat of the cab, she exhaled softly. "Just wrapped up. On my way home now." Her fingers brushed against the baby clothes beside her, the soft fabric making her hesitate. Should she tell him?

"I've got some loose ends to tie up here," Adrian responded, his tone steady as always. "Go ahead without me." Then came the unexpected addition: "The venue proposals should be waiting at the house. Take your time choosing."

Vivian's fingers froze on the car door handle. "Wait... what venues?"

"Our wedding venues," he clarified, the smile evident in his voice even through the phone.

For a heartbeat, the world seemed to pause. Then warmth spread through her chest, lifting the corners of her mouth into an involuntary smile.

The moment she stepped through the foyer, rich aromas of rosemary and thyme greeted her. But Vivian barely registered the food, her gaze darting around the living room instead.

The housekeeper emerged from the kitchen, wiping her hands on an apron. "Looking for the wedding brochures, Mrs. Blackwood?" she asked with knowing amusement.

Heat crept up Vivian's neck, but she nodded. The woman retrieved a sleek portfolio from the console table. "The wedding planner dropped these off earlier. Complete with photos, floor plans, even fabric swatches. Shall I bring them to the dining room?"

"Yes please," Vivian answered, slipping off her heels and making her way to wash up.

Seated at the polished mahogany table, Vivian eagerly flipped open the first proposal. A gilded fantasy unfolded before her - vintage gold decor with cascading champagne roses, delicate feathers suspended from crystal chandeliers. The description boasted hand-sewn pearl beading on every table runner and ethically sourced crystals adorning the drapery.

The second option stole her breath - a cliffside ceremony where the aisle glittered with crushed mother-of-pearl, minimalist glass pillars glowing like captured moonlight against the endless ocean horizon. The price tag rivaled the first venue's opulence despite its apparent simplicity.

Page after page revealed increasingly extravagant possibilities. Though she'd been Adrian's wife for years now, flipping through these catalogs sent little thrills through her. That long-buried dream of a fairytale wedding resurfaced with each turn of the page.

"Your dinner's getting cold, Mrs. Blackwood," the housekeeper gently reminded her, setting down a steaming bowl.

Reluctantly, Vivian set aside the brochures. The meal was light - crisp vegetables with a clear broth, exactly what her tired body craved. She lifted a spoonful of silken tofu, savoring its delicate texture against her tongue.

The simple pleasure of good food after a long day, the excitement of wedding plans, the warmth of knowing Adrian was thinking of her even while working late - these quiet moments filled her with contentment.

Outside, the city lights twinkled like scattered diamonds against the night sky, mirroring the spark of anticipation glowing in her chest.
###Chapter 506

The maid observing from the doorway smiled approvingly. "You barely touched your lunch, so I assumed you weren't hungry. That's why I made mostly vegetable dishes tonight."

Vivian offered a faint smile. "It's exactly what I needed, thank you."

What the staff didn't know was Vivian's carefully guarded secret. She hadn't breathed a word about her possible pregnancy - not even to Adrian. Revealing it prematurely seemed dangerous. What if the test had been wrong? She couldn't bear disappointing Margaret and Beatrice, who'd been longing for a grandchild.

Her mind drifted back to the car ride earlier. She'd nearly confessed to Adrian but stopped herself at the last second.

This wasn't news to share lightly. She'd wait until absolutely certain. That night, after completing her skincare routine, Vivian slipped beneath the silk sheets, the day's events replaying in her mind. She didn't hear Adrian return until well past midnight.

He entered their bedroom freshly showered, his damp hair glistening in the dim light. Sitting beside her, he flipped through architectural catalogs with one hand. Soon their conversation dissolved into quiet laughter and lingering caresses. His fingers traced the curve of her waist as his lips found the sensitive spot below her ear. The familiar warmth of his touch sent shivers down her spine.

Then reality struck like lightning - intimacy during early pregnancy could be risky. Her pulse quickened as she gently pushed him away. "Not tonight, darling."

Adrian's brow furrowed. "What's wrong?"

Vivian scrambled for an excuse. "Just a bit of stomach discomfort. And I'm exhausted."

Concern softened his features. He pressed a tender kiss to her forehead. "Get some rest then, my love."

Several days later, Emberglow County's newly developed tourist district was taking form. The renovations had preserved the charming village's rustic character while modernizing amenities. Though Ambermyst hadn't premiered yet, the combined star power of Sebastian Hartwell and Vivian's reputation had already put Emberglow on the map. Visitors drawn by social media buzz discovered a picturesque town surpassing all expectations - a true hidden gem.

That weekend, the sprawling Blackwood estate hosted a family gathering. Adrian and Vivian arrived for dinner, accompanied by several executives for business discussions. The evening promised both professional conversations and familial warmth.

Vivian had grown accustomed to the executives' polite detachment during previous meetings - always respectful yet distant, as if uncertain how to treat her. Tonight, their demeanor had transformed completely. The moment they entered, the executives greeted her with enthusiastic smiles.

"Mrs. Blackwood, this project's success owes everything to your vision," one executive gushed, his excitement boyish.

"Absolutely remarkable!" another chimed in. "Turning an obscure village into the season's hottest destination? That's no small achievement."

"You've been far too modest about your contributions," a third added. "Your screenplay generated more publicity than our entire marketing budget combined."
###Chapter 507

Adrian Blackwood stepped back into the room after finishing his phone call, his hand naturally finding Vivian Hartley's shoulder.

His touch was light, but the pride in his eyes spoke volumes. "Naturally," he said with a smirk. "This project's success belongs entirely to my wife." His teasing tone carried as he addressed the executives. "When bonus season comes, remember who earned your extra zeros."

The executives nodded enthusiastically, their admiration genuine. "Absolutely, Mrs. Blackwood! Just say the word - anything you want is yours."

Vivian's cheeks warmed under their praise. She nudged Adrian playfully, downplaying her role. "It wasn't just me. The timing aligned perfectly with the government's new policies. A month earlier or later, and we wouldn't have caught this wave."

"Perhaps," one executive countered with a smile. "But fortune favors the brilliant." He paused dramatically before adding, "With your intellect, grace, and charm, Mrs. Blackwood, you're like the legendary queens of old - destined to bring prosperity wherever you go."

Vivian bit back laughter, lowering her lashes to hide her amusement. Their flattery was theatrical, straight out of some period drama, but she had to admit - they were masters at their craft.

Nearby, Margaret Blackwood watched with quiet satisfaction. Her daughter-in-law had come so far, earning respect in ways she'd never anticipated. "Dinner is served," she announced warmly. "Shall we move to the dining room?"

Margaret was pleased to see Vivian helping Adrian excel professionally. Her initial concern had been Vivian's modest background making her seem like just a trophy wife. But Vivian had proven that even without family connections, she could be Adrian's equal partner.

As the group moved toward dinner, Beatrice Blackwood chuckled from her seat. "Our Vivian was truly a hidden gem, wasn't she? It's wonderful to finally see her shine."

The executives exchanged glances, guilt flickering across their faces as they remembered their earlier indifference. One cleared his throat earnestly. "It's not that Mrs. Blackwood was overlooked. We simply failed to recognize her brilliance sooner."

"Exactly!" another jumped in, seizing the chance to redeem himself. He turned to Adrian with a joking tone. "Mr. Blackwood, your instincts are unmatched - not just in business, but in choosing partners. While the rest of us were blind, you'd already secured the ultimate asset. Honestly, if we were your competitors, we'd surrender now."

Margaret observed quietly before suddenly serving Vivian a generous portion. "Eat more. You've gotten too thin. I may not understand your work completely, but seeing these business leaders respect you makes me proud. Though as a Blackwood, your primary responsibility remains starting a family."

Beatrice quickly added, "Don't misunderstand - we're not pressuring you. You're young, your body will recover beautifully. When Margaret had her children—"

Before she could finish, the atmosphere shifted palpably. While some executives maintained neutral expressions, most family members looked distinctly uncomfortable. Margaret dropped her spoon in surprise.

Lost in thought, Vivian's hand drifted unconsciously to her abdomen. Since the positive test, she often imagined feeling the baby's heartbeat, though she knew scientifically it was too early. Still, that maternal connection defied medical timelines.

"I—" Vivian began, but Beatrice smoothly redirected. "Try this organic chicken - our housekeeper's family raises them specially."

The executives, assuming Vivian was too young for motherhood talk, quickly changed subjects to ease the tension.
###Chapter 508

A sudden tension rippled through the dining room. While some executives maintained their composure, most family members couldn't hide their shock. Margaret, caught unprepared, even let her silverware clatter onto her plate.

Vivian's fingers absently traced circles over her abdomen. Ever since seeing those two pink lines, she'd become hyperaware of every flutter inside her. Logically, she knew it was too early - her frantic Google searches confirmed fetal heartbeats didn't develop until six weeks. Yet some primal connection defied medical textbooks.

"I—" she began.

Beatrice smoothly intervened. "Darling, you must try this free-range chicken. Our housekeeper's nephew raises them organically in the countryside."

The executives exchanged glances, assuming Vivian was too inexperienced for motherhood. "Mrs. Blackwood—"

"You're still practically newlyweds," one ventured. "There's no need to rush these things."

Noticing Margaret's distant expression, Beatrice patted her hand. "Exactly. These matters unfold naturally."

Vivian swallowed her announcement. With her morning sickness subsiding and filming schedules overwhelming, she'd postponed her first prenatal appointment anyway. No official confirmation meant no obligation to share yet. She sipped the aromatic broth and remained silent.

Adrian's voice cut through the murmurs. "We're having a wedding." His tone brooked no argument - this wasn't a discussion but a decree.

Margaret snapped to attention. "After two years of marriage? What's the point now?"

Beatrice beamed. "I've been saying this since your courthouse ceremony! Every bride deserves her moment."

Though displeased, Margaret held her tongue. With Vivian's screenwriting accolades, the Blackwoods had no reason to be ashamed of their daughter-in-law anymore.

Leonard, quiet until now, set down his wineglass. "Have you chosen a location?"

"Not yet," Adrian replied.

Vivian quickly added, "Adrian's team presented several concepts, but we're still finalizing details."

Margaret immediately assumed her matriarchal tone. "Let me review these proposals. A Blackwood wedding reflects our family's standing—it requires proper planning."

"This isn't some corporate merger, Mother," Adrian countered.

Beatrice gently squeezed Margaret's wrist. "Darling, trust the children to handle their own celebration. Times have changed since our day."

The executives wisely remained neutral, though Margaret's cheeks flushed at being contradicted publicly. The clinking of fine china became the only sound in the suddenly tense dining room.
###Chapter 509

Vivian stepped in to diffuse the tension. "I'm still learning the ropes here, Margaret, so I'll absolutely need your wisdom when I encounter unfamiliar territory."

Margaret gave an indifferent shrug, feigning disinterest. "Seems I'm always the one picking up the slack."

A radiant smile spread across Vivian's face. "That's only because you're the backbone of this family."

Margaret's stern expression melted slightly. Vivian couldn't help but muse silently. Despite all her subtle attempts to connect, Margaret remained distant. Yet this simple acknowledgment seemed to strike a chord. It was like gifting someone an entire banquet when they only asked for an appetizer, then feeling slighted when they weren't grateful.

In that moment, Vivian understood she needed to completely revamp her approach to family dynamics.

After dinner concluded, Adrian and the executives adjourned to the study for business discussions. Margaret and the grandparents retired to their quarters, leaving Vivian alone in the expansive great room.

Now completely at ease, she curled up on the sofa, legs tucked beneath her, enjoying dessert while scrolling through social media. She'd been watching an educational clip when Audrey sent her a scandalous video featuring Sebastian Hartwell in a plunging white V-neck suit.

"Viv! You lucky girl! This A-lister is absolute fire - puts Dominic to shame!"

Just as Vivian prepared to reply, a crystal bowl of golden cherries appeared before her. Assuming it was the housekeeper, she reached automatically, but the hand holding it didn't release. Puzzled, she heard a velvety voice above her.

"Vivian, living the high life, I see. Perhaps you should skip the cherries."

Startled, she quickly concealed her phone and looked up into Adrian's smirking face. He leaned down, his warm breath tickling her ear.

"Am I not satisfying you enough between the sheets?"

His voice alone sent delicious tremors down Vivian's spine. She pouted, closed the chat, and offered him the phone.

"That's not fair! Audrey sent it - I wasn't seeking it out. Check my history if you don't believe me."

Adrian glanced at the screen, placed the bowl in her lap, and seized the opportunity to nibble her earlobe.

"Wait for me at home tonight."

Later that evening after their return, Vivian took a quick bath and feigned sleep when Adrian had a video conference, granting her temporary reprieve.

The next morning, the Emberglow County government was filming promotional material requiring interviews. Adrian stood by the bed backlit by sunlight, wearing a black suit with a daring V-neck cut. The golden halo around his silhouette gave him an almost mythical quality, like a storybook prince. Normally he favored conservative suits with undershirts.

Still drowsy, Vivian suddenly understood his wardrobe choice - it was retaliation for Sebastian's video. She held up two fingers. "You're seriously holding a grudge over this?"

Adrian didn't bother denying it as he approached, his voice laced with playful menace. "You waste time on cheap thrills instead of appreciating the masterpiece in your own home. Clearly you haven't experienced true excellence yet."
###Chapter 510

Vivian studied him carefully. For this local event, he'd forgone all accessories - not even his signature wristwatch. Just as she was about to tease him about his minimalist style, she spotted the subtle glint of yellow diamond cufflinks peeking from his sleeves. A quick calculation put their value at $4.4 million. She swallowed her joke, threw off the covers, and sat upright.

Adrian approached, tucking a stray lock of hair behind her ear with gentle fingers. "Would you like to join me?" His voice was velvet soft.

Vivian hesitated before shaking her head. "I should stay and work on the script. The new characters aren't quite right yet - perfect opportunity for some quiet reflection."

Adrian didn't push. After a brief, tender moment, he departed. Vivian lingered in bed before finally rising to freshen up. At her desk, she stared blankly at the computer screen, thoughts scattering like leaves in wind. A glance at the clock showed it was still early.

Her hand drifted unconsciously to her abdomen, triggering the memory of her pending pregnancy checkup. Decision made, she resolved to visit the hospital today. Originally considering Eleanor's medical facility, she realized that would undoubtedly alert Adrian. Instead, she booked an appointment at an exclusive private hospital. Best to handle everything today before informing the elder.

The weekday hospital lobby was eerily quiet when Vivian arrived alone. Only two young women sat across the hall, waiting their turn.

One woman eyed Vivian's sunglasses and face mask suspiciously. Leaning close, she whispered conspiratorially, "You're a mistress too, aren't you? That's why you're hiding your face - scared the wife will recognize you?"

Vivian froze, brain scrambling for an appropriate response. What kind of opening line was that? Had she stepped into some bizarre parallel universe? Who even says things like that?

The woman continued unprompted, her voice dropping to a dramatic whisper. "Last week I saw a wife drag her husband's mistress here for an abortion. Designer clothes, acting all high and mighty until the wife started screaming 'harlot' while yanking her hair. Total loss of dignity."

Finishing her story, the woman gave Vivian a pointed look. "You should terminate before the wife finds out. Trust me, you don't want to end up like that poor girl."

Vivian's initial reaction was to dismiss her as delusional, but the casual mention of abortion struck like a physical blow. Being mistaken for a mistress was one thing, but discussing her child that way? Unforgivable.

"Insane," Vivian muttered through clenched teeth, storming toward the doctor's office without another word. The woman's indignant protest followed her - "How rude! Calling people crazy like that!"

The doctor asked routine questions before handing her a form. "Please proceed to the lab for bloodwork to check your progesterone and HCG levels." Exiting the office, Vivian headed toward the lab, unaware of Julian watching from the stairwell, water bottle in hand.

Only after she disappeared from view did Julian's gaze lift to the department sign above: Gynecology. He approached a nearby nurse who'd been stealing glances at him. "Excuse me," he asked smoothly, indicating the door Vivian had entered, "what examination was that woman having?"

During his hospital stay, staff had noted the parade of luxury vehicles coming and going for him. They'd received specific instructions to accommodate him exceptionally. Even without knowing his exact identity, his wealth and status were obvious. A young, handsome, affluent bachelor - the nurse never imagined he'd have any connection to a pregnant patient.
###Chapter 511

The nurse met his gaze without hesitation. "All three women who came in this morning were here for pregnancy screenings."

"Pregnancy tests?" Julian Montclair's eyes darkened instantly, an unreadable tempest swirling behind his composed mask as the air around him grew heavy.

His abrupt change startled the medical staff. "Mr. Montclair? Is everything alright?"

Hearing her voice, Julian's expression softened, the icy edge melting away as his usual polished demeanor returned. The nurse blinked rapidly, wondering if she'd imagined the momentary intensity.

Before she could process the strange interaction, Julian had already turned on his heel, pulling out his phone with practiced ease. "Find a way to alter Vivian Hartley's test results," he murmured into the receiver.

Elsewhere in the hospital...

Giselle Thornton wheeled her IV stand toward the restroom when a familiar silhouette caught her eye - a woman in oversized sunglasses and a wide-brimmed hat slipping through the gynecological wing. Her breath hitched. "Vivian? What's she doing here?" The realization struck like lightning. "Unless..."

A cruel smile twisted her lips as she watched the retreating figure. Vivian had destroyed her perfect life, and now Giselle would make sure the socialite queen experienced hell on earth - even if she had to light the match herself.

On the bustling set of a luxury perfume shoot, Serena Whitmore lounged beneath a striped canopy, engrossed in her phone while absently sipping an iced latte. Her legs were crossed in an unladylike sprawl that would have horrified her PR team.

Miranda Graves scanned the perimeter before discreetly tapping Serena's bouncing knee with a straw. "Must you sit like a truck driver? There are cameras everywhere."

Serena didn't even glance up. "Who cares? Once I'm in Switzerland, these vultures can choke on their gossip columns. All that fake admiration while they secretly hope I fail? I'm done playing nice."

Miranda massaged her temples. In fifteen years of talent management, she'd never encountered an actress so openly contemptuous of her fanbase. "Your cardiac treatment isn't guaranteed to work," she reasoned quietly. "What if you need to return to the industry? Best not to burn every bridge."

The comment ignited Serena's temper. She hurled her drink to the ground, sending dark liquid splattering across Miranda's cream-colored dress - an exquisite designer piece gifted by Adrian Blackwood specifically for today's client meeting.

Adrian showered Serena with enough haute couture to stock a boutique, while Miranda received only the occasional thoughtful trinket from the mogul himself. Sometimes she wondered how different life might have been had Adrian assigned her to manage Vivian instead. But destiny rarely offered do-overs.

Dabbing frantically at the stains with wet wipes, Miranda hissed, "You're walking on thin ice this time. Control your temper."

The ruined fabric mocked her efforts - another casualty in Serena's endless drama. Across the set, photographers adjusted their lenses, oblivious to the silent war raging beneath the glamorous surface.
###Chapter 512

A notification pinged on Serena's phone from an unlisted number. "Vivian is expecting."

Her fingers danced across the screen in rapid response. "Who is this? Why share this with me?"

The reply came instantly, veiled in secrecy. "Names don't matter. We share the same goal - seeing Vivian destroyed."

"Playing cloak and dagger games," Serena hissed, stabbing at her phone to return the call. A robotic voice chilled her: "The number you have dialed is no longer in service."

She froze, the realization hitting her like ice water. This informant wanted complete anonymity. Racking her memory, she couldn't place anyone in Vivian's orbit who'd betray her this way.

Looking up at Miranda, Serena murmured, "You might be onto something. This could change everything."

"What?" Miranda asked distractedly, still mopping up spilled coffee.

With calculated calm, Serena ordered, "Verify Vivian's pregnancy."

Miranda straightened, drying her hands on a towel. "Why the sudden interest?" Her voice carried a note of curiosity.

A venomous smile curled Serena's lips. "If she's pregnant, we'll make sure she loses it. And we'll pin it all on Adrian. That kind of wound never heals."

"No woman forgives the man who takes her child," Miranda agreed with a knowing nod.

Meanwhile, in the hospital waiting area, Vivian twisted her hands nervously. A nurse approached with an apologetic smile. "Miss, our equipment is malfunctioning today. We can't process your test. Please return home - we'll call when it's fixed."

This being her first pregnancy check-up, Vivian felt adrift. As she spoke with the nurse, the woman who'd been sitting beside her earlier collected her paperwork and left.

Vivian's brow furrowed. "Everyone else got their results. Why am I still waiting?"

The nurse's smile tightened. "Different tests, different processing times. This isn't my first rodeo - do you think I'm lying to you?"

A memory surfaced - the woman beside her had mentioned being a regular at this hospital. Vivian stood abruptly. "My apologies. First-time jitters. Please notify me when my results are ready?"

"Of course," the nurse said briskly before turning away. Unseen by Vivian, the woman exhaled sharply as she retreated down the corridor.

Emberglow County.

The recording session wrapped, and the crew invited Adrian to join them for dinner.
###Chapter 513

"Ah, my wife has strict rules about curfews." Adrian chuckled lightly, his warm eyes twinkling with genuine amusement. The way he said it made it clear he wasn't complaining - just stating a fact he actually enjoyed.

The gathered guests burst into laughter. "Who would've thought? The mighty Mr. Blackwood, just as whipped as the rest of us!"

After exchanging a few more pleasantries, Adrian made his way to his sleek black Bentley.

Just as his hand touched the door handle, a hesitant voice called out. "Mr. Blackwood, could I have a moment?"

He turned to see Penelope Holloway standing there. Her father headed the local tourism board, but Penelope herself had always blended into the background - until now. Her plain features and small-town demeanor made this bold approach surprising.

Adrian's expression instantly cooled. "What is it?" The sudden shift in his demeanor sent a chill down Penelope's spine, reminding her painfully of their first encounter. Her fingers twisted in her skirt as she struggled to find words.

"I don't have all night," Adrian said icily.

That seemed to jolt her into action. "Is it Serena you're going home to?" she blurted out.

Adrian's face remained impassive, but his dark eyes turned dangerous. "That's none of your concern."

Penelope visibly trembled but pressed on. "Serena isn't who you think she is. Her father's a gambler who caused that terrible accident—"

"Stay out of things that don't concern you," Adrian cut her off sharply.

Without another word, he slid into the car. Ethan, after closing the door firmly, turned to Penelope with a polite but warning smile. "Whatever you think you know about Ms. Whitmore, I suggest you keep it to yourself. She's not someone you want as an enemy."

All the courage drained from Penelope's face. She stood frozen as the Bentley pulled away, watching until its taillights disappeared around the bend.

Finally, she whispered to the empty street, "Adrian, what will you do when you learn the woman you love is your enemy's daughter?"

Adrian arrived at Seabreeze Villa to find Vivian kneeling in the garden, carefully tending to the gardenias. His grandparents had brought the plants during their last visit, and Vivian had developed a particular fondness for them. Since discovering her pregnancy, she'd stopped wearing perfume, preferring the natural scent of fresh flowers instead.

Dressed in simple white loungewear, she glowed in the golden light of the setting sun. The usually cool, composed Vivian looked softer somehow - radiant and warm.

She looked up at the sound of his approach, her eyes meeting his. "You're home early."

Adrian lifted the takeout bag in his hand, a small smile playing on his lips. "Noticed you haven't been eating much lately. Got your favorite - lemon chicken."
###Chapter 514

Vivian's delicate nose twitched as Adrian drew near. The faint but unmistakable trace of floral sweetness clinging to his tailored suit made her stomach clench. "Since when do you wear vanilla blossom perfume?" Her heightened senses since the pregnancy made every foreign scent glaringly obvious against his signature sandalwood cologne.

Adrian crouched beside her gardening spot, his lips curling into that infuriatingly handsome smirk as he brushed a stray curl from her forehead. "That, my love, is the scent of your imagination working overtime."

She leaned back, dirt-crusted hands planting on her hips. "Don't patronize me," Vivian snapped, her gaze darting to the suspiciously unmarked shopping bag he carried.

His rich laughter echoed through their private garden, the sound usually soothing but now grating on her nerves.

Realizing he was deliberately provoking her, Vivian scrambled to her feet, leaving muddy handprints on her linen dress. "I'm not imagining things! If you're seeing someone behind my—"

Adrian's large hand covered her mouth mid-sentence, his eyes dancing with amusement. "Hush now."

"Stop deflecting. You're starting to sound exactly like Audrey with your careless remarks. Words can wound deeper than knives, you know."

Vivian's glare intensified as she wiped her soil-streaked hands on his pristine white shirt. "And you're channeling Dominic with your silver-tongued excuses."

One dark eyebrow arched as he closed the distance between them. "Silver-tongued? You'll have to taste for yourself to be certain."

Before she could retort, his lips claimed hers in a searing kiss that left her breathless. In retaliation, Vivian pressed her filthy palms against his chiseled jawline, smearing rich garden soil across his perfect features. She pulled back just enough to admire her handiwork—the dirt somehow accentuating his rugged masculinity rather than diminishing it. Some men could fall into a pigsty and still look like they belonged on a magazine cover.

Adrian's chest vibrated with deep laughter as he captured her mouth again. "Someone's feeling feisty today," he murmured against her lips.

Without warning, he hoisted her over his shoulder like a sack of flour, heading toward their bedroom. Vivian shrieked and pounded his back. "Adrian Blackwood, put me down this instant!"

A stinging swat landed on her backside. "Not until you apologize for your baseless accusations," he teased.

"Now! I can't—" She bit off her protest, suddenly hyperaware of the precious life growing inside her. The abrupt position change made her dizzy with panic.

Adrian immediately stilled, carefully lowering her into a cradle hold. His expression softened as he studied her pale face. "You've been unusually fragile lately."

Vivian nearly blurted the truth about their baby but caught herself. That vanilla scent still haunted her. She leveled him with her most piercing stare. "I mean it, Adrian. Where were you really today? That perfume didn't come from nowhere."
###Chapter 515

The scent of jasmine lingered in the air as Adrian paused mid-step. He lifted his sleeve to his nose, frowning slightly. "Perfume?" His expression cleared as realization dawned. "Ah, right. Penelope came to speak with me before I left Emberglow. Must have picked it up then."

He gave Vivian one of those infuriatingly charming smiles. "That nose of yours should be registered as a weapon. We stood a good three feet apart - how did you even catch that?"

"Penelope?" Vivian's fingers stilled on his tie.

"Walter Holloway's daughter," Adrian explained, his voice carefully neutral. "The one who arranged your team's stay at the inn during the Emberglow shoot."

Recognition flashed across Vivian's face, followed by a smirk. "Oh, her. The girl you had midnight rendezvous with."

"I didn't go to her," Adrian corrected, his voice dropping to that dangerous octave Vivian knew too well. "She came to me."

Vivian made a show of adjusting his collar. "Semantics. The end result's the same, isn't it?"

Adrian's gaze turned glacial. "Choose your next words carefully, Ms. Hartley. The Blackwood Group retains excellent libel lawyers."

Vivian shrugged, unfazed. "What's the worst that could happen? A slander suit? I'll just plead temporary insanity."

In one fluid motion, Adrian scooped her up, carrying her into the penthouse. He deposited the takeout bags on the marble counter before pinning her against the sofa, his face mere inches from hers. "The courts are backlogged enough. I'll handle this... misunderstanding personally."

Noticing the housekeeper hovering near the kitchen, Vivian shoved at his chest. "Alright, alright! I take it back!"

Adrian arched a brow, mimicking her favorite retort. "Apologies after the fact are worthless."

Realizing she'd walked into that one, Vivian switched tactics. She let her lashes flutter, her voice dropping to that breathy register she knew he couldn't resist. "Adrian... I'm starving."

He exhaled through his nose, the fight leaving his shoulders. "Ask whatever you want. Just stop inventing scenarios."

"Words leave deeper scars than knives," he murmured, brushing a strand of hair behind her ear.

Vivian ducked her head, adopting her best contrite expression. "I know."

Only then did Adrian release her, straightening his suit jacket. "Your hands are filthy." He caught her wrist, leading her toward the powder room. "Wash up before you eat."

As she trailed behind him, Vivian marveled at how effective feminine wiles could be. No wonder Serena had kept Adrian wrapped around her finger for years.

At the sink, Adrian worked the soap between her fingers with surprising gentleness, ensuring every trace of dirt disappeared down the drain. He even patted them dry with a monogrammed towel afterward.

Vivian let him fuss, then casually dropped the bomb. "So what did Penelope want? Another love confession?"

Adrian's hands stilled for a fraction of a second before resuming their task. "No." The hesitation told Vivian everything she needed to know.

She pouted, extracting her hands. "Fine. Keep your secrets."
###Chapter 516

Adrian's piercing gaze locked onto Vivian's. "What if I choose not to explain? Will you stop jumping to conclusions?"

Vivian met his stare unflinchingly. "You have your right to silence, just as I have mine to think whatever I please. You can't police my thoughts, can you?"

With a resigned exhale, Adrian finally relented. "She somehow dug up some information about Serena's family background—"

Vivian knew Serena came from modest beginnings in Crestwood's outskirts. Mr. Holloway held some local sway, making it easy enough for Penelope to uncover certain details about Serena's past.

Curiosity piqued, Vivian tilted her head. "Why would Penelope suddenly bring up Serena?"

Adrian hesitated briefly before responding. "I mentioned going home for dinner with my wife. She must have assumed I meant Serena."

Vivian's breath hitched. The mental image of Adrian playing the devoted husband before a room full of middle-aged socialites sent heat rushing to her cheeks. Such public displays of affection felt unbearably intimate.

Adrian leaned down, pressing a kiss to her forehead. "Now will you stop overanalyzing and just eat?"

"Mmm." Vivian nodded obediently.

Across town in the penthouse suite of Harbor Grand Hotel, city lights painted the spacious interior in golden hues through floor-to-ceiling windows. Serena lounged on the plush sofa, her silk nightgown shimmering as she swirled a glass of cabernet. Though her eyes traced the glittering skyline, her expression remained distant, lips pressed into a thin line.

Beneath her polished exterior simmered something darker, barely contained.

Opposite her, a rough-looking man shifted uncomfortably in his chair. His leather jacket showed signs of wear, tattooed fingers drumming nervously against denim-clad knees as he watched Serena with unease.

"The view's magnificent, isn't it?" Serena mused, voice detached. "All this beauty... only attainable through wealth and influence."

The man cleared his throat, wiping sweaty palms on his jeans. "Serena, there's... an issue. Someone's asking questions about your father's accident. An actual witness came forward. Don't know why they stayed quiet all these years, but now—"

Serena set her wineglass down with deliberate calm. "So what if Adrian learns my father was a drunk driver?" Her laugh held no warmth. "He stopped caring about me long ago. Why would my family history matter to him now?"

Her lips twisted into a bitter smile. She'd always been vain, yes. But when a man like Adrian—devastatingly handsome, impossibly wealthy, with patience that seemed endless—had stood by her side, she'd felt entitled to recklessness.
###Chapter 517

The man hesitated, his features turning to stone. "Serena, it's not just about the ID. That woman... her connections run deep."

"I know you've risked enough for me already," Serena interrupted sharply, striding across the lavish penthouse to the mahogany sideboard. She retrieved a worn leather portfolio and thrust it into his hands. "You protected my father when no one else dared, and you brought Vincent to me. For that, I'll always be grateful."

Her manicured finger tapped the portfolio impatiently. "Take it. Enough to open that little bookstore you always wanted. Disappear. The past won't chase you."

The man stared at the bulging envelope, the edges frayed from use. Nearly fifty thousand in crisp bills peeked through the opening. He recoiled as if burned. "Serena, I didn't come for money. I chose to protect your father, and you already gave me more than I deserved. You know I'm not like that."

"Take it," she commanded, her voice like chilled steel. Turning toward the floor-to-ceiling windows, she hugged herself tightly. "The past is dead. I called you here for a different reason."

The man stood abruptly, clutching the portfolio like a lifeline. "Don't say help," he rasped. "Just tell me what you need."

Serena turned slowly, unshed tears making her blue eyes glitter. "She's carrying his child." Her voice broke, but she lifted her chin defiantly. "If that baby lives, Adrian will have his perfect family."

"And where does that leave me?" The whisper sliced through the penthouse's silence. She collapsed onto the ivory sofa, pressing trembling fingers to her temples. "I can't... I won't go back to being nothing. Not after tasting this life. It would be kinder to put a bullet in my head."

The man's jaw clenched. Conflict warred in his gaze before resolve hardened his features. "Understood. That child will never draw breath. Whatever you need, Serena. Consider it done."

Across the city, Adrian Blackwood lounged in his dining chair, phone pressed to his ear. Opposite him, Vivian Hartley picked at her salmon salad with disinterest.

"The producers want to schedule the variety show announcement," Adrian said, his piercing gaze studying Vivian's reaction. "Your thoughts?"

Vivian didn't glance up. "Doesn't matter. Whatever works."

With Katrina's identity exposed and the scandal settled, any formal announcement felt redundant.

Adrian's brow furrowed. "'Whatever'? This is our official debut as a couple. Show some enthusiasm."

Vivian set down her fork with deliberate calm. She met his gaze for a loaded moment before suggesting, "After the wedding, perhaps?"

Adrian considered her for a heartbeat before nodding decisively. He spoke into the phone, "Two weeks from today."

Vivian's fork clattered against her plate. "That's... soon."

Adrian ended the call and leaned forward, his voice dropping to that intimate timbre that always made her pulse stutter. "Why wait?" His fingers brushed hers. "I'm done playing games."
###Chapter 518

The sun cast golden rays through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Kingsley Studios. Inside the executive conference room, Vivian Hartley sat poised, her manicured fingers resting lightly on the polished mahogany table. The air was thick with tension—her contract renewal negotiations had taken an unexpected turn.

The success of Ambermyst and the revelation of her true identity as Katrina Spencer had sent shockwaves through the industry. Kingsley Studios, which had once treated her with indifference, now scrambled to secure her loyalty.

When they discovered she was married to Adrian Blackwood, the CEO himself had stepped in, offering an S-tier contract—reserved only for A-list stars. Vivian, though rising in fame, wasn’t quite at that level yet.

It was obvious why they were bending over backward. The Blackwood Group held massive influence in entertainment, with investments spanning blockbuster films and luxury endorsements. Even if Vivian had been a nobody, they would’ve rolled out the red carpet just to stay in Adrian’s good graces.

The CEO, Soren Rodgers, inwardly cursed his earlier misjudgment. He had assumed Vivian was merely some executive’s kept woman when the Blackwood Group discreetly covered her breach fees. Never had he imagined she was Mrs. Blackwood. His oversight had inadvertently handed their rival, Ivory Phoenix Productions, a golden opportunity.

Across from him, Vivian remained unreadable. Her expression was cool, her posture flawless. The same man who had once dismissed her now wore an ingratiating smile.

"Vivian," he began smoothly, "if there are any terms you'd like adjusted, we're happy to accommodate. Additionally, considering Lydia’s inexperience, we’re considering assigning you a more seasoned manager. I recall an unfortunate incident where Serena Whitmore was cast over you due to a managerial oversight. With a more experienced team, such mistakes wouldn’t happen again."

Lydia, standing nearby, paled. Before she could speak, Vivian lifted her chin slightly.

"Lydia has been exceptional," she said, her voice calm but firm. "I wouldn’t have made my comeback without her."

Her words were a quiet rebuke—a reminder of how little Kingsley Studios had valued her before.

Soren’s smile faltered. He hadn’t expected such steel from someone so young. No wonder she was Adrian Blackwood’s wife. A man of his stature wouldn’t settle for anything less than formidable.

"Of course," he backtracked hastily. "If you're satisfied with Lydia, she’ll remain your manager—"

Vivian didn’t let him finish.

"Thank you for the consideration," she interjected smoothly. "But I’ve decided not to renew my contract. My focus may shift toward family matters."

Soren’s composure cracked. "Please, don’t worry about scheduling conflicts. We can be flexible—just as we have been."

Vivian shook her head. "There’s no need for exceptions. Contracts should be honored, not bent for special treatment."

She rose gracefully, her movements deliberate. "I appreciate Kingsley Studios’ early support. Even if we part ways now, I’m open to future collaborations."

Defeated, Soren had no choice but to concede. "Consider us family. If you ever write another script, we’ll double whatever Ivory Phoenix offers."

Vivian gave a polite nod. "I’ll keep that in mind."

The meeting was over.

As she walked out, Lydia hurried after her, relief and gratitude in her eyes. "You didn’t have to do that for me."

Vivian smiled faintly. "Yes, I did."

Behind them, Soren slumped into his chair, already dreading the board’s reaction.

He had just lost the most valuable asset Kingsley Studios never truly had.
###Chapter 519

Considering her ongoing maternity leave and recovery period, acting roles were currently out of the question for Vivian. However, her sharp mind for storytelling remained undiminished, making scriptwriting the perfect way to stay involved. Both Kingsley Studios and Ivory Phoenix Productions would greatly benefit from her creative genius.

After wrapping up their meeting, the CEO walked Vivian to the building's exit. "Vivian, where to next? Shall I arrange a car for you?"

With effortless grace, Vivian declined. "That won't be necessary. My ride's already here. I'm meeting Adrian at Blackwood Group headquarters."

As if on cue, a sleek black limousine glided to the curb. Ethan emerged from the driver's seat, opening the rear door with practiced ease. "Mrs. Blackwood, your chariot awaits." Vivian slid into the plush interior as the vehicle merged seamlessly into traffic.

The moment the taillights disappeared, the CEO's pleasant expression hardened. He turned to Lydia with icy precision. "I seem to recall Vivian even stayed at your apartment when she first signed with us. How could you fail to disclose her circumstances? Do you have any idea the opportunities we've lost because of this oversight?"

Lydia let out a bitter laugh. "With all due respect, how could I report what I didn't know? Vivian's personal life was just that - personal. She wasn't auditioning to be some manufactured pop star, and her contract certainly didn't prohibit relationships. Since when did management require prying into employees' private affairs?"

"This isn't some factory assembly line," the CEO snapped. "We're in the entertainment business. As her manager, you should have exercised better judgment."

Unfazed, Lydia lit a cigarette, exhaling slowly as she weathered the familiar storm of criticism. In this industry, dressing-downs came with the territory.

Just when she thought the lecture had concluded, the CEO delivered his final blow. "Lydia, I suggest you consider resigning voluntarily. While you've shown dedication, your results simply don't measure up. A forced termination might... complicate your future prospects."

Lydia's grip tightened around her cigarette. No achievements? She'd built three artists from obscurity to stardom, each generating millions for the company.

"Since you'll be leaving of your own accord, no severance will be provided," the CEO continued, avoiding her gaze. "Though given your family's wealth and your... advancing age, perhaps this is for the best. Maybe it's time to focus on settling down. After all, what's more important than family? Look at how many executives sacrifice their personal lives for this cutthroat business."

The patronizing dismissal stung like salt in a wound. Crushing her cigarette with deliberate force, Lydia replied through clenched teeth, "How very thoughtful of you."

Missing her sarcasm entirely, the CEO added casually, "While you're still here, would you mind grabbing me a coffee from next door?"

A cold smile curved Lydia's lips. "Actually, I'll be rather busy drafting my resignation. After that, I suppose I should rush off to find a husband and start popping out babies. So no, I won't be fetching your coffee today."

With that, she turned sharply on her heel and strode back into the building, leaving the CEO gaping like a fish out of water.

Meanwhile at Blackwood Group headquarters, Vivian entered the gleaming lobby, designer coffee cup in hand. She immediately noticed the reception desk now boasted two impeccably dressed young women who practically tripped over themselves to greet her.

"Good afternoon, Mrs. Blackwood!" they chorused with synchronized bows, their smiles stretching unnaturally wide.

The change was almost comical - gone was the indifferent receptionist who'd once eyed Vivian with barely concealed disdain. These new hires practically vibrated with eager-to-please energy, their posture straightening to military precision as Vivian approached.

Vivian offered them a polite nod before heading toward the private elevators, the click of her heels echoing through the marble-lined space. The transformation in her reception served as yet another reminder - she wasn't just Vivian Hartley anymore. She was Vivian Blackwood now, and that name carried weight in this building.
###Chapter 520

The receptionist with rosy cheeks gasped, "Mrs. Blackwood, you're even more breathtaking in person than in your photographs! Would you honor me with your signature?"

Vivian blinked in surprise, instinctively stepping back toward Ethan. "What's going on here?" she whispered.

Before Ethan could explain, the second receptionist produced a glossy portfolio from beneath the desk. "Mr. Blackwood had your promotional materials distributed company-wide," she beamed. "Every department has them - we're all huge fans!"

Vivian maintained her practiced smile, though her stomach twisted with embarrassment. She could feel her toes curling inside her designer heels as she signed autographs and posed for selfies with the starstruck employees.

"You're absolutely radiant, Mrs. Blackwood!" the first receptionist sighed dreamily.

Her colleague giggled behind her hand. "Truthfully, we never thought anyone could match our CEO's standards. But seeing you - such elegance and charm wasted on that human iceberg? It's practically criminal!"

Meanwhile, twenty floors above, Adrian suddenly sneezed into his paperwork. He frowned at the air conditioning vents, wondering why he felt an inexplicable chill.

After finally escaping the reception area, Vivian entered the private elevator clutching a steaming latte. When the doors opened on the executive floor, her breath caught.

Directly opposite the elevator doors hung a life-sized portrait of herself - professionally lit, perfectly styled, and prominently displayed where every visitor would see it. The image captured her mid-laugh, eyes sparkling with genuine joy. The sheer audacity of this public declaration left her momentarily speechless.

Adrian had always been intensely private about their relationship. For years, most people didn't even know they were married. She'd told herself his discretion didn't bother her, but now, faced with this bold statement, warmth flooded her chest.

Had they been this open from the beginning, perhaps Serena wouldn't have dared return, and those who'd mocked her would have thought twice.

The sound of animated chatter snapped her from her thoughts.

Curious, Vivian moved toward Adrian's office and froze at the unexpected sight. A group of stylish young women - clearly not Blackwood Group employees - clustered around his usually immaculate workspace. Their colorful outfits clashed with the office's sleek modern aesthetic. The glass desk disappeared beneath an avalanche of gift boxes, silk ribbons, and elaborate packaging.

Adrian stood amidst the chaos, his brow furrowed in concentration as he examined various items. At the sound of the elevator, his head jerked up. The moment their eyes met, his stern expression melted into something tender. In three long strides, he was at her side.

"To what do I owe this pleasure?" he murmured, his voice warm.

Vivian lifted the coffee cup with a small smile. "Thought you might need this."

Adrian accepted the drink, his fingers lingering against hers before twining their hands together to lead her inside. The assembled women immediately straightened, their excited chatter dying down as they offered respectful greetings.
