I signed a contract marriage with Adrian Blackwood to save my brother. For two years, I played the perfect wife while secretly writing screenplays as 'Katrina Spencer'. But when his ex-lover framed me and our marriage burned to ashes, I served divorce papers with a $150M clause. Now he's discovered my secret career... and that I'm the girl he saved from that fire ten years ago.
