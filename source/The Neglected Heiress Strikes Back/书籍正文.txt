###Chapter 1

Isabella Sinclair stared at the signed divorce papers on the table, her ex-husband's name already inked in bold strokes.

Her vision blurred as she looked out the window, tears threatening to spill.

Nathan Prescott stood framed by the golden afternoon light, his tall figure exuding an aura of cold dominance. Even his shadow seemed indifferent.

"I've signed. It's your turn now." Nathan didn't bother turning around, his voice clipped. "The prenup ensures no messy disputes. You'll get two million and a villa in Wye. Consider it compensation—enough to convince Grandpa you weren't discarded like trash."

Isabella felt like she'd been struck by lightning. "Does... does Grandpa know?"

"Would it change anything if he did?" His tone was mocking.

Her knees nearly buckled, but she gripped the table for support. "Nathan," she whispered, voice trembling, "can we... not do this?"

Finally, he turned, his piercing gaze locking onto hers.

Those deep eyes, those sculpted lips—still enough to make her heart stutter.

"Why?"

"Because I love you." Her voice cracked. "Even if you don't feel the same... I still want to be your wife."

Nathan scoffed. "Enough. A loveless marriage is torture. You knew this was temporary—a rebellion against Grandpa. You knew my heart belonged to someone else."

His phone buzzed. The moment he saw the caller ID, his entire demeanor softened.

"Victoria," he answered, voice warm. "You're here already?"

Isabella flinched. That tenderness—was this the same man who'd just crushed her heart?

"I wanted to surprise you!" Victoria Sterling's cheerful voice carried through the speaker.

Nathan was already moving toward the door. "Wait for me. I'm coming."

And just like that, he was gone.

The study door clicked shut, sealing her in suffocating silence.

Ten years of unrequited love. Three years of marriage. She'd given everything—only for him to walk away without a backward glance.

Now, he was free to marry the woman he'd always wanted.

The pain was unbearable.

Isabella took a shaky breath, staring at Nathan's signature on the papers. A single tear splashed onto the page.

That night, Nathan returned to Windermere Estate with Victoria in his arms.

The frail woman clung to him, their intimate display drawing stares from the staff.

"Nathan," Victoria murmured, fingers tracing his chest, "should we really be doing this? Isabella might—"

"She won't care." His reply was ice-cold. "Our marriage was a contract. She knows her place."

The Prescott family fawned over Victoria while Isabella remained invisible—hidden in the kitchen, preparing dinner like a dutiful ghost.

Then, chaos erupted.

"Sir! Sir!" The butler burst in, frantic. "Mrs. Prescott—she's gone!"

Nathan frowned. "What?"

"She left through the back! A black Rolls-Royce picked her up!"

He stormed to their bedroom. The divorce papers sat on the nightstand, tear-stained but signed.

Outside, a luxury car sped away, vanishing into the night.

She couldn't bear to leave this afternoon—now she flees like the devil's chasing her?

Nathan yanked out his phone. "License plate EWA 9999. Find out who owns it."

Five minutes later, his secretary's voice was hesitant.

"Sir... it's registered to the Ashbourne family. Specifically—Cassius Ashbourne."

Nathan froze.

Isabella—a small-town girl with no connections—was linked to the Ashbourne heir?

Impossible.

"Sir," the secretary added carefully, "did you really file for divorce today?"

Nathan's jaw clenched. "What of it?"

"...It's her birthday."

The words hit like a sledgehammer.

Meanwhile, inside the Rolls-Royce, Cassius Ashbourne gently squeezed his sister's hand.

"Welcome back," he murmured. "We've prepared fireworks for you tonight."

Isabella—no, Evadne Ashbourne—leaned against her brother, eyes swollen. "Not in the mood."

Her phone buzzed. Not Nathan—Victoria.

[Told you I'd take him back. Stop dreaming.]

Evadne laughed bitterly, the last tear sealing her resolve.

"Still can't let go?" Cassius pulled her close.

"Cassius," she whispered, "today was my birthday."

"I know. And that bastard brought her home on purpose."

Her next words were steel. "There's nothing left to hold onto. Nathan Prescott shattered my heart."

When she lifted her head again, all traces of love were gone.

Evadne Ashbourne was done being invisible.

"I clawed my way here. Looking back would be my biggest regret."
###Chapter 2

The Abernathy family gathered for dinner, their laughter filling the grand dining hall. Everyone was in high spirits—except for Thaddeus. His dark brows were furrowed, his untouched meal growing cold before him.

Isabella had left with nothing—not the two million dollars, not the mansion, not even a single personal belonging. Just walked out with Cassius by her side.

"Where's Isabella? Why isn't she joining us?" Frederic Abernathy, Thaddeus’ father, glanced around in surprise.

"We're done." Thaddeus didn’t look up. "Divorce papers are signed. I’ll finalize the legalities soon."

"Divorce? Why?" Frederic’s voice sharpened.

"Frederic, I told you years ago—this marriage was forced by his grandfather. They were never compatible."

Elspeth sighed dramatically. "That poor girl endured three miserable years. Now she’s finally letting go. Honestly, it’s for the best. You know Thaddeus has always loved Acacia."

"Thaddeus, marriage isn’t a game. Especially when it comes to Isabella—"

"It’s over. She’s gone." Thaddeus’ jaw tightened.

"That country girl has some nerve," Glynnis Abernathy sneered. "What’s her angle? Trying to play the victim now?"

Thaddeus’ expression darkened further.

"You’re being reckless. Your grandfather is still ill—how will you explain this to him?" Frederic’s worry was palpable.

"I’ll tell him the truth. Next month, I’ll announce my engagement to Acacia."

Acacia’s eyes sparkled as she gazed at Thaddeus’ sharp profile, her lips curving into a sweet smile.

"You’ve lost your mind! Abandoning your wife like this—do you care nothing for your reputation?"

"Never have." Thaddeus’ voice was ice. "Isabella was never the woman I wanted."

"Mr. Frederic, don’t blame Thaddeus." Acacia leaned against him, her voice trembling. "It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have come back into his life… I’ll leave tomorrow. Thaddeus, you should reconcile with Isabella. I don’t want to ruin you—"

"This isn’t about you." Thaddeus took her hand firmly. "I’m done with Isabella. And you’ve suffered enough. I won’t let you walk away again."

The evening air was crisp, the river shimmering under the city lights.

Cassius had taken Isabella on a private boat, drifting along the water as fireworks painted the sky.

"Bro, are you trying to torture me?" Isabella groaned, eyeing the couples around them. "This is a date spot. I’d never come here alone!"

"Blame your other brother. He insisted on fireworks at eight."

Cassius checked his watch. "Five. Four. Three. Two. One."

A massive purple firework exploded overhead, followed by four more spelling out Happy Birthday!

The crowd erupted in cheers.

"His taste is… questionable." Isabella shook her head, but warmth spread through her chest.

"Considering his track record, this is an improvement." Cassius pulled her close. "And there’s more waiting at home. Everyone’s gifts are piled in your room." He squeezed her shoulder. "Isabella, you’re loved. Don’t waste your heart on those who don’t deserve it."

Her throat tightened.

Just then, a sleek Maybach pulled up nearby.

Thaddeus stepped out, Acacia clinging to his arm. She giggled as the night breeze tousled her hair, pressing closer to him.

"Thad, look! The fireworks are gorgeous!"

Acacia’s innocent charm had always captivated him—so unlike Isabella’s cold reserve.

Then, four more fireworks burst—Happy Birthday!

Thaddeus stiffened.

Today was Isabella’s birthday.

A boat drifted past—and there she was. With Cassius.

"Is that… Ms. Isabella?" Acacia feigned surprise. "Who’s that man with her? They look… close."

Thaddeus’ grip on the railing turned his knuckles white.

Was she already moving on? Then why had she cried so desperately in front of him earlier?

As the boat docked, Cassius guided Isabella off, his arm around her waist.

"Isabella!"

She froze at Thaddeus’ voice.

Turning slowly, she met his furious gaze. Even now, his face sent a traitorous pang through her.

But no more.

"Who is he?" Thaddeus demanded.

"Memory failing you, Mr. Abernathy?" Cassius smirked. "We’ve crossed paths in business before."

"Isabella. Answer me." Thaddeus ignored him, stepping closer.

"We’re divorced. Who I’m with is none of your concern." Her voice was steel.

"You’re seeing someone before the divorce is even finalized?"

The audacity.

Cassius’ eyes narrowed. As Thaddeus moved to strike, Isabella stepped between them.

Protecting another man?

Thaddeus’ rage flared.

"You flaunted your mistress in my face for years. What right do you have to question me?" Isabella’s laugh was sharp. "Or is it only the husband who gets to play?"

Her words struck like a blade.

Acacia, rushing over, stumbled—her heel snapping. She fell with a dramatic cry.

"Thad! My ankle!"

Thaddeus turned to help her.

When he looked back, Isabella and Cassius were gone.
###Chapter 3

The Ashbourne family's grand estate stood proudly in Silveke Harbor, overlooking the glittering waters.

A sleek black Bentley rolled to a stop on the crimson carpet leading to the mansion's entrance. Adrian Ashbourne, the second son of the Ashbourne dynasty, stepped forward to greet his sister, opening the car door with a flourish.

"Welcome home, Your Majesty."

Under the golden glow of the chandeliers, Seraphina Ashbourne's beauty was breathtaking. She had already slipped into her stiletto heels during the ride, her posture regal and untouchable—every inch the queen returning to her kingdom.

"Adrian, is everything alright at home?"

"Couldn't be better. Though we've all been waiting impatiently for your return." His handsome face lit up with excitement. "Did you see the fireworks tonight? My birthday gift made headlines! They're calling me the mysterious billionaire who set the sky on fire for love."

Seraphina smirked. "Oh, I saw. The internet is convinced you're some hopeless romantic hiding behind your fortune. Congratulations on your new reputation."

Adrian only grinned wider, pulling her into a tight embrace.

"Seraphina, you're not leaving again, are you?"

"Where would I go?" She exhaled sharply, forcing a laugh. "I'm divorced. It's not like I have anywhere else to be."

She patted his back reassuringly, though her voice wavered. "I let everyone down. Three years of trying, and I still couldn't keep a man. What a spectacular failure."

The bitterness in her chest was suffocating, but she refused to let it show.

From the moment she walked out of the Abernathy estate, she had sworn—no more tears for Damien. He wasn't worth a single one.

"That bastard Damien!" Adrian's jaw clenched. "How dare he betray you? Tomorrow, I'm launching a full investigation into the Abernathy Group. I'll ruin him!"

Beside them, Lucian sighed. "Oh, for heaven's sake."

"Stay out of it, Lucian. You're a public servant," Seraphina reminded him with a tired smile. "Adrian, why can't you be more like your brother? Calm. Rational."

"Because Lucian gave up on life years ago," Adrian retorted, adjusting his tie with a scowl. "But me? I don't let things slide. They can mess with anyone else—but not my sister. The Abernathy Group is officially on my radar."

With Lucian on her left and Adrian on her right, the three siblings strode into the mansion, laughter echoing through the halls.

Meanwhile, inside the study, Alistair Ashbourne—the formidable chairman of the Kingsley Group—was pacing impatiently. The stern lines of his face softened the moment he heard his daughter's voice.

"Dad, I'm home!"

Seraphina sauntered in, collapsing onto the plush sofa. She kicked off her heels, sending them flying across the room.

Lucian took a seat beside her and, without hesitation, began massaging her sore feet.

"Must you act like a child?" Alistair grumbled, though his eyes betrayed his affection. "You're a grown woman. Carry yourself like one."

"Since when have I ever?" Seraphina shot back, glancing at the wall where a framed painting hung—one she had done as a child, winning a prestigious art competition.

Alistair had dug it out of storage and displayed it like a treasure.

The Ashbourne patriarch, infamous for his four marriages, had always been the subject of society's gossip. Disillusioned by the family's drama, Seraphina had left years ago, joining Doctors Without Borders to heal those who truly needed her.

"And here I thought you'd at least pretend to care about your father's health after being gone so long," Alistair huffed.

"Thank you for the compliment, Dad!" Seraphina grinned sweetly.

"Father," Lucian interjected, his tone serious. "Now that Seraphina is back, there's something we need to discuss. I'm stepping down as president of the Kingsley Group. She's taking over."

Seraphina's gaze sharpened, studying her brother's resolute profile.

"What?!" Alistair sputtered, momentarily speechless.

"I only agreed to manage the company for three years. My time is up." Lucian's expression was serene, almost saintly. "You know my calling isn't here. I belong in the church."

"Then let Adrian do it!" Alistair snapped, grasping at straws.

"Absolutely not." Adrian paled. "I'm a government official. Any ties to a conglomerate would get me suspended—or worse, investigated."

Alistair groaned. What was the point of having so many children if none of them could take over his empire?

His health was failing. He wanted to retire. But his sons? Useless.

And his daughter—

"Who says a woman can't run this company?" Seraphina lifted her chin. "I'll do it."

"You think it's that easy?" Alistair scoffed. "The Kingsley Group isn't some toy. Do you even understand business? Or do you just vanish whenever things don't go your way?"

His voice cracked with frustration. "Three years, Seraphina. Three years without a word. Do you know how worried we were? Your mothers? I thought you'd been blown to bits in some warzone!"

Her chest tightened, eyes stinging.

She had resented him for years—blamed him for her mother's suffering. But disappearing after her secret marriage to Damien? That was on her.

"Father, Seraphina knows business as well as I do," Lucian said calmly, sipping his coffee. "Remember the financial crisis four years ago? Those recovery strategies were hers. And the Farley Group acquisition? She stayed up for days drafting the plan."

Alistair's brows lifted in surprise.

"You don't know your own daughter," Adrian added. "She's the sharpest of us all. You've always had an eye for talent—why not give her a chance?"

After a long pause, Alistair exhaled. "Fine. If you want to prove yourself, here's your test."

Seraphina straightened, eyes gleaming.

"Take a week to rest. Then, report to the Kingsley Grand Hotel in Elmsworth. You have six months to renovate and turn its profits around. Succeed, and the presidency is yours."

As they left the study, Lucian and Adrian each placed a hand on her shoulders.

"Looks like you've got your work cut out for you, little sister," Lucian murmured.

"Welcome back to the chaos," Adrian sighed.

Seraphina clenched her fists, ambition surging through her veins. "Pressure only makes me stronger. The harder they push me down, the higher I'll rise."

The brothers exchanged a knowing smile.

"The future of the Ashbourne legacy," Lucian said softly, "is in your hands now."
###Chapter 4

Five days had passed since the incident. Alexander Kingsley summoned his secretary, Lawrence Bennett, after the morning briefing.

"Any updates on Isabella?"

Standing by the floor-to-ceiling window overlooking the Manhattan skyline, Alexander's imposing figure cast a long shadow across the room. The tension was palpable.

"I'm afraid not, Mr. Kingsley." Lawrence wiped his brow nervously. "She never returned to the hospital where she worked. I personally checked her supposed hometown in Boston, but the address was fabricated. No records exist of anyone with her surname."

"A fabricated identity?" Alexander spun around, his stormy eyes darkening.

"Yes, sir. The local registry office had no records of any Isabella Sinclair." Lawrence still referred to her as "Mrs. Kingsley" out of habit.

Alexander's mind reeled. What kind of woman had he married? Was she some kind of corporate spy?

"Did you investigate Daniel Carter? He was the one who took her away that night."

Lawrence hesitated. "If Mr. Carter wanted to conceal her identity... we'd have little chance of uncovering anything."

Alexander's pulse spiked. Fury burned in his gaze.

Daniel always seemed honorable. How could he be involved in this?

"Perhaps this isn't entirely bad news, sir? It's not like he stole your—"

A lethal glare from Alexander cut him off mid-sentence, leaving Lawrence coughing from the sudden pressure.

The memory of Daniel shielding Isabella that night flashed vividly—those protective eyes holding unspoken warnings.

Alexander's chest tightened. How had his plain, unremarkable wife attracted someone like Daniel Carter as her guardian?

He recalled her desperate plea to save their marriage:

"Alexander... can we not get divorced? Because... I love you!"

"Liar!" Alexander slammed his fist on the desk, radiating icy rage.

The more he dwelled on it, the angrier he grew—and the angrier he became, the more obsessed he got.

His phone vibrated across the polished mahogany.

Taking a steadying breath, Alexander saw Evelyn Prescott's name and answered.

"Evelyn. What is it?"

"Alexander, I'm in the Kingsley Group lobby." Her saccharine voice dripped through the receiver. "I baked your favorite cookies. Won't you come get me?"

Even Lawrence felt his skin prickle at the cloying tone.

"You're in the corporate lobby?" Alexander's brow furrowed.

"Yes, darling. Is that... a problem?" Her voice turned wounded. "Don't you want to see me?"

"No. Lawrence will escort you up."

Hanging up, Alexander's expression darkened further.

The divorce papers with Isabella hadn't been finalized. If Evelyn made a public appearance now, the media frenzy would be disastrous.

Not that he cared about scandal, but—

His phone buzzed again.

The caller ID made his pulse stutter.

"Grandfather."

"You insolent boy! Have my words become wind to you?" Reginald Kingsley's roar shook the speaker. "I warned you—no contact with the Prescott girl after marrying Isabella! Now you parade her through our headquarters? Have you no respect for your wife's dignity? Get your ass to my office immediately!"

The air in Reginald's pentoffice was thick with tension.

Leaning heavily on his cane, the patriarch sat fuming on the leather sofa, flanked by his assistant and William Kingsley.

Alexander stood rigidly at attention while Evelyn was barred from entering—Reginald declared "such women" weren't worthy to breathe the same air.

"Explain yourself! What is this dalliance with Prescott's daughter?" The cane thundered against marble.

"Father, please calm—" William began.

"The three years are up." Alexander's voice was gravel. "You promised—marry Isabella for three years, then the choice was mine. That time has passed."

Reginald paled as if struck.

In those three years, sweet Isabella had cared for him daily. A thousand sunrises had slipped by unnoticed—he'd forgotten the deadline entirely!

"My choice is to end this farce and be with the woman I love. You gave your word. Isabella already signed the papers. We'll finalize it this week."

"You divorced her already?" Reginald shot up, vision swimming, nearly collapsing.

Alexander moved to steady him but was violently shoved away.

"Father! They've only signed the agreement—not filed yet! Your blood pressure—" William intervened urgently.

"Why must you defy me? Why reject the only daughter-in-law I've ever approved?" Reginald's voice broke.

Alexander stood frozen. William looked helpless.

"I want Isabella back! Bring her to me! Without her, this family will crumble! She's the only wife I'll accept!"

"Alexander, call Isabella now! Your grandfather needs to see her!" William urged.

"It's pointless, Father. Even if I dragged her here, our marriage is over. There's no going back."

Alexander believed in clean breaks. Time would heal all wounds.

With a strangled cry, Reginald collapsed backward.

Pandemonium erupted as William and Alexander scrambled for the emergency line and medication.

Cornered, Alexander reluctantly dialed Isabella's number.

"The number you have dialed is no longer in service."

Not only had she vanished—she'd disconnected her phone?

"Damn it!" Alexander's fists clenched until his knuckles blanched.

Meanwhile, at The Grand Chateau Hotel...

Executives clustered anxiously awaiting their new general manager.

"A woman GM? Seriously?"

"Four male managers failed to turn this place around. What's some girl going to do? Magic?"

"Rumor says she's Chairman Sinclair's blood daughter—"

"With how many wives he's had? Probably some discarded bastard child. If she were important, why dump her here?"

Snickers rippled through the crowd.

"She's here! The new boss!"

A fleet of luxury vehicles glided to the entrance—Rolls-Royce in the lead, Maybachs following. The spectacle silenced all whispers.

The door opened, revealing first a pair of stiletto Louboutins. Power radiated from that single step.

Then emerged a vision—a statuesque beauty with curves that defied physics, flawless complexion, and eyes sharp enough to cut glass. Her very presence commanded submission.

"Good afternoon."

Her rosebud lips parted in a smile that stopped hearts. "I'm your new GM. But let's clarify one thing—" The smile turned razor-edged. "I'm no bastard child. Disappointed?"

The gossiping employees broke into cold sweats.

Minutes earlier, inside the limo...

Isabella Sinclair had hacked the hotel's security cameras with three keystrokes, watching their every move.
###Chapter 5

The ugly truth about those top executives badmouthing the female president was finally exposed.

"Unbelievable! Miss Sinclair is the rightful heiress of the Ashford family! What were they thinking?" Jason, the president's secretary in the passenger seat, was so furious his face flushed crimson.

"Oh, stop with the 'rightful heiress' talk. That's ancient history. I don't care, so why are you still hung up on it?"

Isabella smirked, reaching out to pinch Jason's cheek, turning it even redder.

"Isabella, you're the future CEO of K Group. Shouldn't you act more presidential? Stop teasing Jason like that."

Caspian frowned slightly.

"What's the problem? Male bosses flirt with their secretaries all the time, but I can't even touch my male secretary's face?"

Isabella arched a brow, amused. "Besides, he should be thanking me!"

Caspian just shook his head, his gaze softening with fond exasperation.

Meanwhile...

The executives swarmed around Isabella and Caspian as they entered the hotel.

Vice President Keith Porter led them toward the elevator, but Isabella casually remarked, "I want to inspect the restaurant first."

No greeting, no pleasantries—straight to business.

Keith swallowed nervously as he guided President Ashford and her entourage to the buffet area.

Caspian remained composed, letting his sister take charge.

It wasn't lunchtime yet, so the restaurant was empty, but staff were already setting up the food.

Isabella's sharp eyes swept over the spread before locking onto the seafood section.

She rolled up her sleeves, plunged her hand into the tank, and plucked out a dead shrimp from the hundreds swimming inside.

"Explain."

"Th-That shrimp isn't dead—" Keith stammered.

"Not dead? Then why don't you eat it?" Isabella challenged, smiling sweetly.

"President Ashford, with so many shrimp, it's normal for one or two to die—"

"It's normal for shrimp to die. But if a customer eats it and gets food poisoning, will you still call it normal?"

Her smile vanished. "Also, there are exactly 356 shrimp in this tank. I counted. Five are dead, and at least thirty are barely alive. I don't know how guests would react to finding that in their $30 meal, but personally? I'd never come back. Dispose of all the seafood immediately and find a new supplier. If I see one dead shrimp at tomorrow's lunch, I'll personally serve it to you."

Keith paled. The executives gaped.

Only Caspian and Jason knew Isabella had a photographic memory. As a child, she'd even helped solve a major crime case with her keen observation. Counting shrimp was child's play for her.

Upstairs in the guest rooms, Isabella took a white handkerchief from Jason and wiped it along the walls and picture frames.

"Subpar cleaning. There's dust. Do it again."

The executives looked ready to collapse.

"You're thinking I'm being nitpicky, aren't you?"

Her tone turned icy. "But these 'minor' issues could ruin a century-old hotel. If the star-rating committee found these problems, we'd lose our accreditation!"

She gestured to Jason, who ordered, "Open this room."

The head of housekeeping fumbled with the key. Previous inspections had always been staged—two pre-cleaned rooms for show.

But President Ashford didn't play by their rules.

Isabella strode in, inspecting the bathroom first, then the bedroom. She sat on the bed—and her expression darkened.

She said nothing, ending the inspection abruptly before heading to the general manager's office with Caspian.

11:26 AM

"So, what's your verdict?" Caspian asked with a faint smile.

She flopped onto the sofa, propping her elbow on the armrest. "A complete disaster. Is Emeric testing me or mocking me? This place is a dump. Is this really an Ashford property?"

"Isabella, Grandfather built this hotel. The Ashford empire started with hospitality before expanding into what K Group is today."

His voice softened. "This hotel isn't a failure—it's a legacy. But with so many ventures now, and the hospitality industry struggling... we've neglected it."

His gaze turned apologetic. "You'll have to work miracles."

That's when Isabella noticed the grand piano in the corner.

Her breath hitched.

"I had it brought in. I remember you used to play when you were upset. Or you'd go riding."

Caspian smiled. "You'll be too busy for horses these next two months. But when you need a break, play something. You were always brilliant at it."

"Thanks. But I haven't played in years."

Her throat tightened. An old wound, long scarred over, throbbed anew.

"What happened?" Caspian tensed.

"Field medic work. Ligament damage in my pinkie during a rescue. It didn't break, but it's useless now. Can't span octaves anymore. So... I stopped."

She kept her tone light, but the ache lingered.

Caspian's heart clenched. He took her hand gently.

"Was it... because of Thaddeus?"

"Yes. And no."

Hearing that name still hurt like hell, but she forced a radiant smile. "I got injured for world peace. That's something to be proud of."

Five years ago, on the war-torn fields of Snis, she'd found Thaddeus—the man she'd loved and lost.

He was a peacekeeper. She was a medic.

She'd nearly lost her hand dragging his wounded body to safety.

Back then, she'd called it honor. Now, her numb finger only brought pain.

But that was the past. Even if she'd loved the wrong man, she refused to drown in regret.

Just then, Jason hurried in.

"Miss, I found what you asked for. Our hotel's bedding and some furnishings are supplied by Vintage Elegance. Mr. Keith handled the contract."

"Vintage Elegance."

Isabella crossed her legs, eyes glinting dangerously. "Get me the hotel's financials for the last two years. Then cut ties with Vintage Elegance and find a new supplier."

Caspian arched a brow. Such a drastic move?

"Vintage Elegance is owned by Thaddeus's brother."

"Ah. Personal vendetta," Caspian and Jason said in unison.

"No! Their products are trash. They sold us cheap bedding, so I'm holding them accountable," Isabella insisted.

The memory of that lumpy mattress made her seethe. Uncomfortable stays led to bad reviews—no wonder their ratings were plummeting!

"There's more," Jason added. "You asked me to monitor the Abernathy situation. Hamilton just had a stroke. He's hospitalized—at our Ashford Medical Center!"

11:26 AM

"Hospitalized?!" Isabella shot to her feet, panic flashing in her eyes.

At that moment, Caspian's phone rang.

He glanced at the screen and smirked.

"Isabella, it's your ex-husband."
###Chapter 6

The name Thaddeus struck Evadne like a blade, piercing straight through her composure.

"Should I answer?" Cassius asked, his voice steady.

"Go ahead."

He tapped the speakerphone button but remained silent, letting the tension build.

"President Ashbourne, is my wife with you?" Thaddeus' voice was rough, strained.

Evadne's fingers curled into fists. Wife? That word was a mockery now. "Mr. Frederic, get your facts straight. I'm your ex-wife."

"So you are with him." His tone darkened, turning glacial.

"What, did you expect me to sit around waiting for you to throw me out?"

Her sarcasm cut like glass.

Thaddeus' jaw tightened. "You're being reckless. The divorce isn't finalized yet. Legally, you're still my wife. Have some respect for the Abernathy name—and yourself."

"You moved Acacia into Windermere Estate while we were still married. You forced me to sign those papers. Tell me, Thaddeus—where was my dignity then?"

A bitter laugh escaped her. "You never cared about my feelings. Why should I care about yours now? Acacia can have the title of Mrs. Abernathy. Let her worry about your family's precious reputation."

Cassius smirked, lifting his glass of water for a slow sip.

This was the real Evadne—not the meek, obedient wife who had endured three years of humiliation. That had been nothing but an act.

And he preferred her like this—sharp, unapologetic, untouchable.

Thank God she was back.

"I don't have time for this," Thaddeus snapped, exhaustion creeping into his voice. "Grandfather is ill. He's refusing treatment unless he sees you."

Evadne's breath hitched.

Despite everything, the old man had been kind to her. She could walk away from Thaddeus, but not from him.

"Ashbourne General? Fine. I'll go."

She hung up, shoulders sagging under the weight of worry.

"Let me drive you," Cassius offered.

"No. This isn't a fight. If you come, it'll just make things worse."

Her eyes were steel. "I'll handle this myself."

Hospital

Thaddeus and Gordon stood outside the private ward, tension thick in the air.

Evadne arrived in a rush, heels clicking sharply against the tile. Even after just days apart, she noticed the hollows under Thaddeus' eyes, the way his suit hung slightly looser.

Stop it. He's not your problem anymore.

Annoyed with herself, she lifted her chin.

The men turned at the sound of her approach—and froze.

Thaddeus barely recognized her.

"Mr. Gordon, how is he?" Evadne ignored Thaddeus entirely.

"Mrs. Abernathy?" Gordon blinked. "Is that... you?"

She almost laughed. In her hurry, she'd forgotten to dull herself down—no demure dresses, no timid smiles. Just sleek black tailoring, blood-red lips, and the glittering butterfly brooch pinned to her lapel.

"Who else would it be?"

"You look... incredible." Gordon swallowed. "Different. Stronger."

"Divorce suits me," she said lightly. "Like shedding dead weight."

Thaddeus' expression darkened. "If being married to me was such a prison, why stay for three years? You could've left anytime."

The old wound ached.

"I made a promise to your grandfather. Three years meant three years." Her smile was razor-thin. "But congratulations—you're free now. No more sneaking around. Acacia can move in permanently."

His chest tightened.

Who was this woman? The Evadne he knew would never speak like this.

And yet—he couldn't look away.

"Thad!"

Acacia's voice shattered the moment. She rushed forward, throwing herself against Thaddeus, her delicate frame trembling.

"You didn't tell me! Don't I matter to you?"

Elspeth hovered behind her, sighing dramatically. "She barely ate lunch. The stress made her sick again."

Thaddeus' arms closed around Acacia. "You're still unwell?"

"The doctors can't find the cause," Elspeth lamented. "We've tried everything."

"I'll arrange for specialists. If necessary, we'll fly to Switzerland."

Evadne watched, numb.

She remembered nights curled over the bathroom sink, dizzy with pain, dragging herself to the hospital alone. Thaddeus had never once asked.

So he could care.

Just not about her.

Acacia shot her a triumphant glance—then did a double take.

Since when was Evadne this stunning?

And that brooch—wasn't that Alea's latest design? Half a million dollars. There was no way Evadne could afford that. It had to be fake.

"Thaddeus, take Acacia in with you," Elspeth urged. "She's been so worried."

Evadne said nothing. Why would she care?

The ward door opened.

"Mr. Frederic is asking for his grandson and granddaughter-in-law," the secretary announced.

Acacia's face fell.

Evadne stepped forward without hesitation.

Thaddeus followed, jaw clenched.

"Thad, wait—!"

The secretary blocked Acacia smoothly. "I'm sorry. Mr. Frederic was very clear."

The door shut behind them, leaving Acacia seething in the hall.
###Chapter 7

The moment Isabella stepped into the private ward, the frail Harrison Sinclair perked up instantly. His dull eyes brightened with recognition.

"Bella! Come here, sit beside me!"

Without hesitation, Isabella obeyed, settling gracefully onto the edge of his bed.

"Mr. Sinclair, how are you feeling? Is there anything troubling you?"

"Nothing ails me when you're near," Harrison rasped, clutching her hand with surprising strength. "Bella, that fool Nathan told me you've divorced. Is it true?"

"Yes. We're no longer married." Isabella's lashes fluttered down, masking the ache in her chest.

"That imbecile! Letting go of a woman like you—does he think he'll find an angel descending from heaven?" Harrison struggled upright, shooting Nathan a venomous glare.

Nathan remained silent, unwilling to agitate his grandfather further.

"Mr. Sinclair, please don't blame Nathan. I didn't want to continue the marriage either. We... simply grew apart." Isabella's voice was soft but firm as she gently patted Harrison's back.

Nathan's jaw tightened.

She wasn't manipulating the situation or turning his grandfather against him. Was this some twisted attempt to win him back?

Isabella, what makes you so sure I'd fall for your games?

"Bella, did they mistreat you in our home? Did Victoria make your life difficult?" Harrison pressed, his grip tightening.

"No. Nathan and I just wanted different things. Divorce was the best solution for both of us."

A flicker of sorrow passed through Isabella's eyes, so fleeting it might have been imagined. "Mr. Sinclair, don't be angry with Nathan. We had good times these past three years. That's enough. No regrets."

Nathan frowned, an unfamiliar tightness in his chest.

Good times? He couldn't recall any. He hadn't even given her a proper wedding—just a rushed courthouse ceremony under Harrison's pressure. She'd moved in with a single suitcase, becoming his wife in name only.

Did she truly consider that beautiful? Or was this her way of mocking him?

"Bella... was I wrong?"

Harrison's eyes glistened with unshed tears. "I only wanted your happiness. I never imagined that fool would throw it all away. Forgive me."

"Please don't say that. Some things just aren't meant to be."

Thirteen years of devotion, gone in an instant. Only she knew the depth of that wound.

But if Nathan could walk away so decisively, clinging would only strip her of dignity. She refused to become that bitter woman begging for scraps of affection.

"Mr. Bennett, bring Bella's birthday gift!"

The butler hurried forward with white-gloved hands, presenting an exquisite velvet box.

Inside lay a flawless diamond bracelet—an antique piece, easily over a century old.

"Mr. Sinclair, isn't this Grandmother's—?" Nathan's voice cracked with disbelief.

"Yes, my wife's favorite. An Abernathy heirloom passed down for generations."

Harrison lifted the bracelet, sunlight catching its facets as his expression softened. "Before she passed, she made me promise to give this to the woman I approved as my granddaughter. Bella, you're the only one worthy of it."

"Mr. Sinclair, I can't accept this. Besides, I'm no longer—"

"Even if you and Nathan are divorced, you'll always be the granddaughter I chose!" Harrison's voice turned steely. "If you refuse, I'll smash it right now!"

"No! I'll take it!" Isabella caught his wrist in alarm. "Thank you, Mr. Sinclair."

"Good girl." Beaming, Harrison fastened the bracelet himself.

The diamonds only enhanced Isabella's natural elegance. Nathan found himself staring—he'd never noticed how delicate her wrists were, how the jewels paled against her luminous skin.

"And you," Harrison rounded on Nathan, "what did you give Bella for her birthday?"

"Mr. Sinclair, Nathan already gave me a gift. One I'll never forget."

Nathan's fists clenched.

Her birthday. The day he'd served her divorce papers.

Isabella, you cut deep.

"Bella, is there truly no hope for you and Nathan?" Harrison pleaded.

Isabella cradled his aged hands gently. "If you care for me, wouldn't you want me to live as I choose?"

Harrison sighed in defeat. "At least stay until my eightieth birthday. It's only days away."

"Grandfather, that's inappropriate," Nathan interjected coldly.

"Inappropriate?" Harrison slammed a fist onto the bed. "Would it be appropriate if you brought Victoria here instead? That woman and her mother think they can control the Abernathy men? Never! As long as I live, I'll never accept her!"

Outside the door, Victoria paced furiously.

"Stop that, you're giving me a headache," Victoria Sterling snapped, massaging her temples. "Harrison's an old man. How much longer can he stand in your way? Secure Nathan's heart, and the rest will follow."

"But while he lives, I'll never be acknowledged as Nathan's wife!" Victoria hissed before glancing around nervously.

"Harrison refused me too, yet here I am," Victoria said, admiring her manicure. "When Nathan insists, even his grandfather will yield."

Victoria's rage cooled slightly—until the ward door opened.

The butler escorted Isabella and Nathan out.

Victoria schooled her features into sweetness—then froze.

The diamond bracelet on Isabella's wrist was breathtaking, putting her own "heirloom" to shame.

Jealousy twisted Victoria's face. As she approached, she deliberately lurched forward—

"Ah!"

She'd planned to "accidentally" snatch the bracelet during the fall.

But Isabella sidestepped gracefully, leaving Victoria to crash face-first onto the tiles.

A sharp crack echoed—

Victoria's own bracelet shattered.
###Chapter 8

"Oh my, Isabella, are you alright?" Olivia gasped, though a small laugh escaped her lips.

Nathaniel rushed over immediately, bending down to help Isabella up from the pavement, but she refused to budge. "Nathan, I'm in so much pain—hold me," she whimpered dramatically, tears streaming down her face as she clutched her knees.

Evelyn stood nearby, arms crossed, watching the scene with icy detachment.

Isabella—always the damsel in distress whenever Nathaniel was around.

"Nathan, Ms. Evelyn pushed me!"

She buried her face in his chest, shooting Evelyn a venomous glare.

"Isabella, what did you just say?" Nathaniel stiffened, his voice laced with disbelief.

"You're seriously accusing me of pushing you?" Evelyn scoffed, unimpressed by the theatrics.

"You think I just fell on my own?" Isabella's usually sweet voice turned shrill with indignation.

"Wouldn't be the first time. You look like a strong breeze could knock you over."

"Are you wishing death upon me?!" Isabella's face flushed crimson. "I felt you shove me when I walked past! How dare you deny it?"

"Ms. Isabella, this is the age of surveillance. Cameras are everywhere—you can't just spew nonsense."

Evelyn's gaze darkened, her presence commanding. "If I find proof, I'll sue you for slander."

Nathaniel's pupils dilated. This wasn’t the meek wife who had waited alone in their empty mansion.

Isabella shrank under Evelyn’s intimidating aura, quickly turning to Olivia for backup.

"Oh dear, it's all just a misunderstanding!"

Olivia subtly glanced at the security camera overhead. "Isabella must have tripped and accidentally bumped into Evelyn. She thought it was intentional—just a silly mistake!"

"Isabella, did you really just trip?" Nathaniel's voice turned cold as he studied the woman clinging to him.

"I thought she pushed me..."

His expression hardened.

Panicked, Isabella blurted, "If she hadn’t moved out of the way, I wouldn’t have fallen! She did it on purpose! And my bracelet—it's broken! It was a family heirloom! If it weren’t for her, it would still be intact!"

She sniffled dramatically. "Ms. Evelyn, I know you're bitter about the divorce, but taking it out on me? Is it my fault your marriage failed?"

Evelyn arched a brow. "First of all, I'm not bitter. In fact, I should thank you for freeing me from misery—no more waiting up all night for someone who never came home."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened.

"Second, if that bracelet was truly an heirloom, you should be thanking me."

She picked up the broken pieces. "It's fake."

"What?!" Isabella gasped. Even Olivia looked stunned.

"Cheap crystals. Wearing them long-term exposes you to toxins that seep into your bloodstream."

Evelyn tossed the fragments into the trash, her diamond bracelet—a gift from Nathaniel’s grandfather—gleaming mockingly.

"Mr. Prescott, if you're going to be with Ms. Isabella, at least buy her real jewelry."

"Evelyn." His voice held a warning.

"There’s a crystal frog on my old vanity at the mansion. Feel free to take it—maybe you can make another bracelet." She dusted her hands off as if touching the fake jewelry had dirtied them.

Frog?!

The insult was crystal clear.

Isabella seethed, but Evelyn was already walking away.

Outside the hospital, Evelyn couldn’t help but laugh at the memory of Isabella’s shocked face.

"Evelyn."

Nathaniel’s deep voice made her turn. A breeze lifted her hair, framing her face beautifully as he approached.

"Something else, Mr. Prescott?" Her tone was frosty. "If Ms. Isabella is still upset about her bracelet, tell her I’ll buy her a dozen at the flea market tomorrow."

"Earlier, in the ward, you told Grandpa—"

"Don’t overthink it. I just didn’t want to upset him." Her expression softened slightly at the mention of Mr. Kingsley.

"Then we’re even."

She blinked.

"You lied about your identity. I won’t tell Grandpa or anyone in the Kingsley family. Consider it settled." His gaze was unreadable.

Evelyn’s eyes widened. Was he serious?

"But you have to tell me—why did you marry me under a false name?" He stepped closer. "No, better question—what were you after when you approached Grandpa with a fake identity?"

Her pulse spiked. She stepped back—

And nearly tumbled down the stairs behind her.

Strong hands steadied her.

Their eyes locked. Evelyn’s cheeks flushed. Nathaniel looked oddly flustered.

Even now, he was devastatingly handsome.

Thirteen years ago, at eleven years old, trapped in darkness, she’d never forget the boy who saved her life.

The Nathaniel now? He hurt her just by existing.

She pushed away, regaining her balance.

"Thanks."

"Answer my question."

"I’m not your wife anymore. I don’t owe you explanations."

She turned to leave, but he grabbed her wrist.

"We haven’t finalized the divorce. Legally, you’re still my wife. So you will tell me who you really are."

"I have nothing to say!"

Her chest heaved, eyes glistening. "You talk about obligations? That’s rich. You failed as a husband for three years—what right do you have to demand anything from me?"

"Evelyn, even if you don’t tell me, I’ll find out."

He yanked her close, their breaths mingling.

He rarely lost his temper, but this woman—ever since she left, she’d been pushing every button he had.

The audacity.

"Then go investigate. Why bother asking me?"

She wrenched free and strode off without looking back.

Nathaniel watched her retreating figure—her sharp red lips, those lethal stilettos—his chest tightening inexplicably.

Since when had she become like this?

Was it to appeal to him?

This cunning woman. Why did Grandpa adore her so much?

"Mr. Prescott! Ms. Isabella says she twisted her ankle—she’s crying and wants you!" Gordon panted as he caught up.

The roar of an engine cut through the air.

A sleek black Bugatti La Volture Noire sped past, its driver—Evelyn—wearing oversized sunglasses, her smirk visible as she zoomed away.

"Mrs. Kingsley is—a secret heiress?!" Gordon’s jaw dropped.

Nathaniel’s eyes darkened.

"After her." His voice was steel.
###Chapter 9

The sleek black steering wheel felt cool beneath Evangeline's fingers as she sped down the deserted road, the haunting melody of "Vengeance Burns in My Soul" blasting through the speakers.

She didn’t care if Thaddeus was tracking her. What baffled her was why—after three years of treating her like invisible air—he suddenly cared now, when their marriage was already in ashes.

Typical man. Ignore them, and they chase. Show interest, and they flee.

A flicker in the rearview mirror caught her attention.

Her grip tightened.

Thaddeus’ Lamborghini was tailing her, relentless.

"You think you can keep up?"

A smirk curled her lips as she slammed the accelerator.

Her La Voiture Noire sliced through the night like a shadow, vanishing in seconds.

"Faster!" Thaddeus barked from the passenger seat, his jaw clenched.

Gordon’s knuckles whitened on the wheel. He’d never driven like this before—his heart threatened to leap out of his chest.

Finally, the faint glow of Evangeline’s taillights reappeared. Thaddeus exhaled, though his expression remained stone-cold.

"Mr. Thaddeus, Mrs. Ashbourne drives like she’s in Fast & Furious! That ‘See You Again’ track suits her perfectly."

Thaddeus frowned. "Since when does she drive like this?"

"You didn’t know?" Gordon’s excitement bubbled over. "She’s obsessed with racing films. Every time I visited, The Fast and the Furious was playing. I always thought she was delicate—turns out she’s a speed demon!"

Thaddeus’ stomach twisted.

His own secretary knew his wife better than he did.

"Damn it—she’s pulling away!"

"If you lose her, I’m docking your salary."

Gordon paled. He feared for his paycheck—but more for his life.

Two sharp turns later, Evangeline’s car disappeared entirely.

"She’s… gone."

Thaddeus slammed his fist against the window, veins throbbing at his temple.

"Evangeline… what else are you hiding?"

That night, Cassian and Adrian arrived at their sister’s private villa.

In the open kitchen, Cassian expertly flipped a sizzling pan while Adrian chopped vegetables. Evangeline lounged nearby, a lollipop dangling from her lips as she watched her brothers cook.

"Victory! Four kills!"

She grinned at her gaming screen, triumphant.

"Still unbeatable, I see." Adrian flashed her a warm smile—the gentlest of the Ashbourne brothers.

"Like a surgeon with a scalpel—precision every time."

She knelt on the chair, arms propped on the table, the lollipop bobbing as she spoke.

"Don’t get cocky. Rematch tomorrow—I’ll show you real skill."

"You forfeited last time. No point challenging me." Cassian handed her a slice of seared beef.

"Only because of that emergency mission! We would’ve won!" Adrian huffed.

"Evangeline, you’re smoke-sensitive. Go wait in the living room." Cassian’s tone softened.

Her chest tightened.

She hadn’t told them—though allergic, she’d cooked for the Abernathys for three years. Her hands bore calluses; her body had built resistance.

If they knew how the Abernathys treated her…

She swallowed the bitterness.

At least she was free now.

Cassian’s phone buzzed.

He wiped his hands, pulled it from his apron, and sighed.

"Evangeline… it’s your ex-husband. Again."

"Seriously? He won’t quit!"

Her face flushed. The lollipop clattered onto the table.

"Thaddeus is still harassing you?" Adrian plucked the candy from the table and popped it into his mouth. "After mistaking Cassian for your boyfriend at Evergreen Meadows?"

"Yes."

Adrian snorted. "The man’s blind."

"What’s wrong with me being her boyfriend?" Cassian arched a brow.

"You look more like her dad."

Evangeline groaned.

"Answer it?" Cassian asked.

"No!"

"Do it."

Cassian hit speakerphone.

"Where’s my wife?" Thaddeus’ voice dripped with possessiveness.

Adrian nearly exploded. Evangeline silenced him with a glare.

"Mr. Abernathy, Evangeline isn’t your wife anymore. Remember the divorce?" Cassian kept his tone neutral.

"She knows the truth." Thaddeus’ voice turned icy.

Evangeline snatched the phone, stormed into another room, and hissed, "What do you want?"

"Why change your number?"

"Fresh start. Clean break."

"What if Grandfather needs you? Give me your new number."

"Call President Ashbourne if you need me."

"Is this your revenge?" His voice darkened. "Running to Cassian the second you leave me?"

"Thaddeus!"

"You think this affects me? I don’t care who you’re with—just don’t embarrass Grandfather before his birthday."

She hung up, trembling.

Leaning against the wall, she fought the sting in her eyes.

"Thirteen years… was it all a lie?"
###Chapter 10

Across town at Windsor Estates.

Alexander Kingsley stood frozen for a full minute after his ex-wife abruptly ended their call.

Her steeliness bore no resemblance to the fragile woman who'd once wept and pleaded when he demanded a divorce.

So for three years, she'd felt nothing for him? Had merely tolerated him for some hidden agenda?

The realization sent fury coursing through his veins.

"Mr. Kingsley, your coffee."

Gordon entered, took one look at his thunderous expression, and hesitated. "Did you reach Mrs. Sinclair? Get her new number?"

Alexander massaged his temples. In his rage, he'd forgotten the original purpose of the call.

He'd assumed life would simplify after Isabella left. Yet here he was, unsettled because she was with Sebastian.

Damn it all. Why did she still affect him?

"Another time. I don't want to discuss that woman right now."

He lifted the coffee cup, took a sip, then frowned deeply.

"What's wrong with this? It tastes different."

"I followed Mrs. Sinclair's recipe exactly. How could—"

"Recipe?"

Gordon nodded. "Before leaving, Mrs. Sinclair gave me a notebook detailing all your preferences. Food aversions, coffee preparation, even what you ate on specific dates and how many bites you took. Everything was meticulously recorded."

He produced a leather-bound journal from his pocket.

Alexander accepted it with uncharacteristic hesitation, slowly opening the cover.

Neat, familiar handwriting greeted him—Isabella's precise script.

"A pinch of salt enhances the coffee's flavor. Alexander prefers it this way."

"He had two bowls of scallop vegetable soup this morning. Note to make it more often."

"Alexander dislikes overly sweet desserts. Try avocado salad—lighter flavors suit him better."

"The ties with red accents I bought last season—he never wore them. Seems he dislikes red..."

Every entry concerned him.

Alexander turned page after page, his breathing shallow as if afraid to disturb the words.

His grip tightened until the paper nearly crumpled.

"If she's so adept at reading people, what ulterior motive could she possibly have?"

Despite the turmoil the notebook stirred, anger won out. He tossed it toward the wastebasket.

"Sir! That's three years of Mrs. Sinclair's observations!" Gordon scrambled to retrieve it. "If she didn't care, why document everything? You clearly mattered to her!"

"Stop calling her Mrs. Sinclair. She forfeited that title."

A commotion erupted outside the study—from the direction of Isabella's former bedroom.

"Investigate that noise," Alexander ordered, rubbing his temples.

Gordon returned moments later, discomfort written across his face. "Mr. Kingsley, it's Ms. Sterling. She's... removing all traces of your ex-wife from the bedroom."

Currently, Victoria Sterling was tearing through Isabella's former sanctuary like a hurricane.

"Isabella Sinclair! You're nothing but a social climber riding some rich man's coattails! What makes you think you can look down on me?"

With the divorce signed and Isabella gone, Victoria vented unchecked—hurling skincare bottles, smashing bedside decorations.

By the time Alexander arrived, the room resembled a warzone.

"Victoria! What is this?"

"I can't stand her presence lingering here! Her scent!" Victoria's tear-streaked face twisted. "If not for her, we wouldn't have wasted three years! She stole my place, then plays the victim? Making me look like the other woman!"

"You're not the other woman. Stop this melodrama."

Alexander's gaze darkened as he knelt, retrieving the shattered remnants of a crystal frog figurine.

Oddly charming, its tiny paw formed a victory sign.

His lips quirked momentarily.

Victoria yanked open the wardrobe, hurling garments wildly.

"What's this?" She ripped open a large box containing an impeccably tailored men's suit. "Ha! Preparing gifts for her next sugar daddy already?"

Alexander's obsidian eyes turned stormy. He seized the box.

"Alex, she played you! I thought she married for love, but she was just using you as her golden ticket!"

Tears streaming, Victoria grabbed a fruit knife from the nightstand and lunged at the suit.

Alexander shielded the box with his body.

The blade sliced his forearm, crimson blooming across his white shirt.

"Oh God! Alex, I—I didn't mean—" The knife clattered as Victoria pressed shaking hands to her mouth.

"Good heavens! What happened?" Elspeth rushed in, aghast at the blood staining the carpet. "Alexander! Explain this!"

"Gordon, arrange a car for Ms. Sterling," Alexander ground out through the pain.

"Alex, let me stay! I need to tend your wound!" Victoria clung desperately.

"Mr. Kingsley, she should remain," Elspeth insisted. "Victoria will be your wife soon—"

"No. She returns home tonight." His tone brooked no argument.

"But once married—"

"We'll have eternity together. Until then, propriety matters. My divorce isn't finalized—her staying would fuel gossip."

Elspeth pursed her lips.

After dispatching a sobbing Victoria, Alexander surveyed the wreckage with weary disappointment, instructing staff to restore order.

"Sir, look at this!" Gordon stood transfixed before the wardrobe, holding up a breathtaking performance costume.

Alexander approached. The gown shimmered—pink silk embroidered with intricate patterns, rhinestones catching the light.

His long lashes flickered, emotions warring.

"Does... Mrs. Sinclair still perform? Remarkable!" Gordon marveled. Today had revealed unexpected facets of his former mistress.

Such a multifaceted woman—why couldn't Mr. Kingsley appreciate her?

"You find her remarkable?"

"Pardon?"

"I find her increasingly inscrutable."

Alexander's jaw tightened, an inexplicable irritation tightening his chest.
###Chapter 11

Evadne swept her hair into a loose ponytail, secured with a simple ribbon. The sky-blue chiffon dress she wore fluttered around her ankles as she moved gracefully, her voice weaving through the melody of Eternal Whispers for Cassius.

Her eyes shimmered like constellations, their brilliance casting a melancholic glow over the moment.

When she finished, Cassius was already clapping, his face alight with admiration. "That was breathtaking. Father's third lover really trained you well. In another era, you'd have had kings fighting for your favor."

"I don't care for kings," Evadne retorted, cracking her knuckles with a smirk. "If I wanted power, I'd take the throne myself."

Cassius chuckled, shaking his head.

Her expression darkened as she settled beside him, thoughts of her father's three wives creeping in. "Evadne, they've all missed you these past three years. They've asked about you—privately."

"What are you getting at, Cassius?"

"You left to join Doctors Without Borders, but we both know part of it was to spite Father." He draped an arm around her shoulders, his smile tinged with sadness. "But he is who he is. We can't change that. And let's be honest—even Thaddeus, the man you loved for years, turned out flawed after three years of marriage, didn't he?"

Her lashes flickered. Her fingers tightened around the bracelet on her wrist.

"You can divorce Thaddeus, but you can't sever blood ties. If you can't cut them, accept them. Father loves you. And his other wives? They're decent women. They've never overstepped. I swear that on my honor."

What Cassius didn’t know was that Evadne had already made peace with them—two years ago.

Gordon had just finished dressing Thaddeus’ wound when he left the room.

Thaddeus massaged his temples, exhaustion weighing on him. Acacia’s hysterics, her tantrums, the destruction—none of it matched the gentle, devoted woman he remembered.

Had she changed? Or had he never truly known her?

No matter. She had stood by him in his darkest days. That loyalty alone meant he would marry her.

His gaze drifted to the suit draped over the couch.

He stood, lifting it for inspection.

Though he and Cassius were similar in height, Thaddeus had broader shoulders, a more muscular frame.

Oddly, the suit seemed tailored for him.

"Disgusting," he muttered.

Yet minutes later, he found himself wearing it.

The mirror reflected a flawless fit—precision stitching, impeccable fabric. This wasn’t off-the-rack. It rivaled bespoke luxury.

Since when did that country girl have such taste?

A knock interrupted him. Alva entered, carrying a glass of milk.

"You're wearing Ms. Evadne's gift?" Her face lit up. "She'll be thrilled!"

"Gift?" Thaddeus stiffened.

"The suit you're wearing—I fetched it from the tailor last month. Ms. Evadne had it made for your birthday. She swore me to secrecy."

His birthday wasn’t for months.

"Alva, I know you favored her, but she's gone. No need to lie for her."

"I’ve served this family since you were a boy. The only person I’d lie for is you." She stepped closer, her voice softening. "She hand-stitched every seam. Chose the fabric herself. Even carved the buttons. She worked on it between chores, hiding it so you wouldn’t find out."

His chest tightened.

"Check the label. Your name’s still there."

Thaddeus tore off the jacket, tossing it aside with a scowl. "We’re divorced. I don’t care what she did. Leave."

"But Ms. Evadne adored you—"

"Adored me?" He barked a laugh. "Then why was she in another man’s arms the second she walked out?"

Alva gasped. "That can’t be true!"

"Three years. That’s how long it takes to really know someone." His blood roared in his ears. "If she never cared, why pretend? Did she think I’d fall for her act? That I’m some fool to be manipulated?"

"You’ll regret this."

"Enough."

Alva sighed, folding the suit with care before leaving.

Evadne’s internal clock woke her at five.

Old habits. This was when she’d start breakfast for the Abernathys.

Now? No smoky kitchen. No demanding in-laws.

Divorce tasted like freedom.

She dressed in fitted athletic wear and took her paddleboard onto the lake behind the villa.

Birdsong accompanied her strokes, ripples spreading across the glassy surface.

Post-workout, showered and refreshed, she descended the stairs—radiant.

Jason gaped.

Today, her hair was pinned up, her makeup understated yet striking. A sleek black coat draped over a crimson sheath dress, accentuating every curve.

"Close your mouth," she teased, snapping her fingers.

He flushed. "You—you’re stunning."

"You’re my brother’s head secretary. Try not to look like a starstruck schoolboy."

The Rolls-Royce glided to the K World Hotel.

Employees froze as she entered—beauty incarnate, yet they trembled like prey.

Yesterday’s lesson had stuck. Floors gleamed. Ingredients were pristine.

After a swift inspection, Evadne retreated to her office.

"You can return to my brother. I don’t need you here."

Jason grinned. "President Ashbourne reassigned me. I’m your secretary now."

Her eyes widened. "His gift is you?"

He nodded.

Unbelievable.

Her brother had gifted her a person.

Jason fidgeted under her silence. "You’re not… rejecting me because I’m secondhand, are you?"

She snorted. "It’s called experience."

"Then I’ll work hard! A raise would be nice, though."

"Perform well, and you’ll live like royalty. Fail, and I’ll toss you back." She propped her chin on her hand, lips curving.

He gulped, launching into his report.

"All Vintage Elegance bedding has been replaced. Every K Group hotel nationwide will follow within the week."

A frantic knock interrupted them.
###Chapter 12

Isabella shot Nathan a sharp glance.

Nathan immediately understood and moved to open the door.

"President Sinclair! President Sinclair!"

Keith, the disgraced Vice President from yesterday, shoved past Nathan before he could stop him.

Isabella's brow furrowed as Keith lunged toward her desk.

"Mr. Keith, why are you still here? Your resignation was approved. Shouldn't you be job hunting?"

"President Sinclair! You can't do this to me!" Keith's face was flushed, sweat beading on his forehead. "I've dedicated nearly twenty years to this hotel! I've sacrificed my health for this place! Chairman Reginald would never dismiss me so carelessly—how can you just force me out?"

Isabella smirked, her voice icy. "I reviewed all senior staff files. You do have health issues—fatty liver and gallbladder polyps. Must've made quite the fortune off this hotel to develop those."

Keith paled, her sarcasm cutting deep. "I had no idea Vintage Elegance was selling us subpar bedding! They've been our supplier for three years—reputable, reasonably priced—I never thought—"

Before he could finish, Isabella flung a file at his feet.

"These are all transactions between the hotel and Vintage Elegance. As Finance Department supervisor, you didn't notice anything suspicious?"

Keith's hands trembled as he picked up the file. The pages burned like hot coals.

"And I received an anonymous tip."

She took a slow sip of coffee, her gaze sharp. "Someone suggested your close relationship with Vintage Elegance involved hefty kickbacks. That’s why you approved their shoddy products."

Keith's knees nearly buckled, his teeth chattering.

"I don’t fire people without proof. But when I have it?" She leaned forward. "No one walks away unscathed. If you disagree, we can settle this in court."

"President Sinclair, I admit my mistake! I acted recklessly! Please—have mercy! If this gets out, I’ll be ruined in Elmsworth!"

Keith was on the verge of collapsing, his face ashen. "Vintage Elegance approached me! Mr. Ives promised easy money! I thought all mattresses were the same—I didn’t realize I was being played!"

Isabella laughed coldly.

A twenty-year veteran playing dumb to save himself. Pathetic.

"Good. You know exactly what happened. Now go home and polish your résumé. That’s more productive than groveling here. Nathan, escort him out."

Nathan dragged Keith out like a kicked dog.

Outside, Keith’s fear twisted into rage. He spat on the ground.

Just wait. This isn’t over.

Isabella exhaled, frustration simmering. The hotel’s corruption was worse than she’d thought.

"Seems everyone knew Keith was dirty. The second you targeted him, someone ratted him out!" Nathan grinned, eager for justice.

"No one ratted him out."

"What? You—you bluffed him?"

"Obviously."

She opened a game on her phone, fingers flying across the screen. "Guilty consciences crack under pressure. They confess before I even finish threatening them."

Nathan marveled at her cunning. "Keith’s been embezzling for years. We should sue, claw back every cent!"

"Leave room for future negotiations. If I’m too harsh, the other executives might turn on me." Her eyes stayed glued to the game. "And Keith was my father’s appointee. No need to humiliate him further."

She paused, voice firm. "Watch him closely. If he contacts Arabella’s brother, alert me immediately."

"Yes, Miss!"

Her phone buzzed incessantly—messages flooding a group chat.

"Nathan, I’m busy. See who’s spamming."

He checked. "It’s the ‘Sinclair Confidential’ group. Someone just tagged you."

The group, created by her brother Oliver, included Isabella and her four siblings. The name implied their pact: her marriage to Alexander Kingsley was a secret. Never to be leaked.

Isabella nearly dropped her phone.

Nathan couldn’t know about her divorce. The fewer who knew, the better. If her father found out? Chaos.

Oliver: "Unbelievable! Is Alexander trying to disgrace himself? This is beyond shameless!"

Sebastian: "I’ll dig up Abernathy Group’s dirt. Bankrupt them in a month."

William: "Give me a week. I’ll make Alexander regret everything."

Reginald: "Amen."

Isabella: "What the hell are you all talking about?!"

Seconds later, Oliver sent a link.

Oliver: "Alexander just announced his wedding! And the internet’s calling you the homewrecker—claiming you sabotaged his relationship!"

William: "Split up? Should I make it permanent?"

Reginald: "Do not fret over the wicked. Like grass, they’ll wither. Stay calm, lest you sin."

Oliver: "Enough preaching. You’re not converting the devil today."

William: "Give me thirty minutes. I’ll erase every damaging headline—including Alexander’s remarriage."

Isabella typed coolly: "Don’t bother. Let it play out."

Oliver: "Why?!"

Isabella: "Because it’s irrelevant. Alexander’s ex-wife was Isabella. I’m Isabella Sinclair. That woman no longer exists."

Oliver: "Exactly! You’ve never been seen with Alexander. No one can connect you to this!"

Isabella’s lips curved. "But I bet someone’s panicking right now."

Alexander, if you want your precious Arabella? Fine. Be happy.

But if she dares drag me into her mess?

She’ll learn what regret tastes like.

The Abernathy Group was blindsided by the wedding announcement.

Media outlets bombarded PR and Gordon’s phones. The news had gone viral.

First: Mr. Kingsley is getting married.

Second: Mr. Kingsley is remarrying.

The world just learned he was married—and now he’s marrying again?

Since when is marriage this casual?

"The Elmsworth Daily broke the story," Gordon said, grim. "Arabella personally visited their editor. Now Twitter’s exploding—everyone’s speculating about his ex-wife. Arabella’s getting crucified—"

"Delete it all." Alexander’s voice was lethal.

The Elmsworth Daily was Abernathy-owned. Its sole purpose: spin favorable narratives.

"Which part? The articles or the public backlash?"

"Everything."

"Yes, sir! But the rumors are out of control. Ms. Isabella must be devastated—"

Alexander’s expression darkened. He grabbed his phone, thumb hovering over Reginald’s contact.

Damn it. He was calling Reginald again. People would talk.

Before he could decide, Arabella’s name flashed onscreen.

His jaw tightened.

This was going to be a long day.
###Chapter 13

"Serena?" Dominic's fingers tightened around his phone, struggling to maintain his composure.

"Dom, you have to help me!"

Serena's voice trembled with panic, thick with unshed tears. "I'm trapped outside the Kingsley Group building—reporters everywhere! I'm terrified!"

"I'm coming down now."

Dominic shoved back his chair, snatching his suit jacket as he stormed out of his office.

"Mr. Kingsley, you can't go!"

Gregory lunged forward, blocking his path. "Send security to retrieve Ms. Serena. If you step out there, you'll be mobbed!"

Dominic didn't pause. He brushed past Gregory without a second thought.

Downstairs, the media frenzy had reached a fever pitch.

"Ms. Serena, when's the wedding?"

"Is it true you and Mr. Kingsley have been in love since childhood?"

"What do you say about the rumors that his ex-wife sabotaged your relationship?"

The questions came like bullets. Security struggled to hold back the swarm, but chaos reigned.

Serena, playing the damsel in distress, smirked inwardly.

She had leaked their engagement. She had planted the stories painting his ex-wife as the villain.

That woman had dared to humiliate her. Now, she'd make sure the world saw her as the homewrecker she was.

"Thank you for your concern," Serena said sweetly, eyes glistening. "Dom and I will share news when we're ready. As for his ex-wife... Ms. Evelyn, I barely know her. Please, leave her alone. She's moved on—let her live in peace."

Her words only fueled the fire.

Just as the crowd surged closer, a strong arm wrapped around her. Dominic shielded her, guiding her swiftly inside.

"Dom, thank God you're here." Serena's voice quivered, tears threatening to spill.

Dominic remained silent, jaw clenched.

Then he froze.

A strange sensation prickled his skin—like he was being watched.

Evelyn.

But that was impossible.

The security camera at the Kingsley entrance adjusted its angle slightly.

In her office, Evelyn watched the live feed from the Kingsley building.

She saw Dominic protectively ushering Serena inside. Saw how Serena clung to him.

A sharp pang twisted in her chest.

"Dominic," she whispered, fingers tightening around her coffee cup. "Did you ever shield me like that?"

Her vision blurred.

That stormy night two years ago—when pain had nearly destroyed her—she had called him.

She knew he wouldn’t answer.

But she had hoped.

All she got was the cold, automated voice of his switched-off phone.

"Three years of loving you," she murmured, "and all I was... was a placeholder."

Her phone buzzed.

Sebastian: Evelyn, the editor who broke the engagement news was fired—on Dominic’s orders. The leak came from Serena, not him.

Evelyn smirked. "In their relationship, there are no secrets. They’re one and the same."

Nathaniel: Perfect. Same playbook.

Nathaniel: Evelyn, I’ve got something big. Private chat.

Adrian: Just say it here.

Nathaniel: No way. This is my intel. Do your own digging!

A voice message popped up.

11:30 AM

"Evelyn, Serena’s got skeletons."

Nathaniel wasn’t just a prosecutor. To the Ashbournes, he was a hacker—sharp, relentless.

And Serena? She hadn’t escaped his scrutiny.

Photos loaded onto Evelyn’s screen.

Serena, clad in scandalous lingerie, wrapped around a mixed-race man. In two shots, they were bare, his hands roaming.

Evelyn whistled. "Damn, bro. Where’d you find these?"

"Her Instagram followers. This guy’s a fitness trainer—popular. Hacked his cloud. Took me days."

"Dinner’s on me tonight."

"Just dinner? No drinks? I’m not coming if there’s no booze."

"Open bar. Drink yourself under the table."

"Don’t celebrate yet. There’s more."

A medical report appeared. Then photos—a woman’s abdomen, marked with stretch marks.

Evelyn’s breath hitched.

"Surprise. Serena had a baby overseas. These? Postpartum scars. She’s been sneaking to the hospital for laser treatments."

Evelyn zoomed in, studying the images.

A weight lifted from her shoulders.

"Thank God," she exhaled.

"God? Seriously?" Nathaniel sounded exasperated. "Even if they haven’t slept together, he still cheated! Evelyn, are you really justifying this? Like, ‘At least the fly I ate was protein’?"

Evelyn laughed. "Not defending him. Just... relieved he didn’t betray me physically."

"Either way, it’s payback time." Nathaniel’s voice turned venomous. "He dumped you—a goddess—for that mediocre snake."

Evelyn’s smile faded.

Thirteen years of love didn’t vanish overnight.

But she’d never go back.

"Let’s leak this," Nathaniel urged. "Destroy her."

Evelyn leaned back, red lips curving.

"Patience, brother. The best weapons... are saved for the kill shot."
###Chapter 14

The entire office watched as Alexander Kingsley escorted Isabella Sinclair into his private domain.

The moment the door clicked shut, Isabella flung herself into his arms, tears streaming down her face. "Alexander, I was so scared—thank God you came for me!" His dark, fathomless gaze remained unreadable as he gripped her shoulders and firmly pushed her away.

"Isabella." His voice was ice.

She blinked up at him, confusion flickering in her eyes. "What's wrong?"

"Care to explain yourself?" His tone was razor-sharp.

"Explain what?"

"Why did you leak our engagement to The Daily Chronicle?"

She exhaled in relief and tried to step closer again. "Because I can't wait to be your wife. Don't you want that too?"

"I do. But not like this." The warmth he usually reserved for her was absent. His expression was rigid. "Why the rush? You know the situation."

"Because Evelyn is out of the picture! The divorce is happening!"

"Not yet." His jaw tightened. "We made a promise to my grandfather. The official divorce won't be finalized until his birthday. Until then, legally, she's still my wife."

He took a deliberate step back. "Announcing our engagement now only complicates things. Grandfather won’t tolerate this."

Logic always came first for him. Emotions were secondary. The only exception had ever been Isabella—yet even now, his words were cutting.

He expected her to understand. They'd known each other long enough.

But her eyes welled with fresh tears. "So I'm the problem now? Are you defending her? Do you actually care what people are saying about Evelyn online?"

"I'm not defending anyone. But Evelyn wasn’t the other woman. This shouldn’t have escalated." He massaged his temples, the throbbing in his skull unbearable.

"Of course she was! She stole three years of my life with you!" Isabella's voice rose to a shrill pitch, grating against his nerves.

"Those three years were necessary. Without her, Grandfather would never have allowed us to be together."

The words left a bitter taste in his mouth.

Because it was true. If Evelyn hadn’t walked away when the time was up, his grandfather would never have relented.

That woman—always smiling, always tending to him without complaint. Drawing his baths, laying out his clothes, never demanding a thing.

She hadn’t fought the divorce. Hadn’t even hesitated before signing the papers and vanishing from his life.

Even if she’d chosen another man in the end, she’d fulfilled her role impeccably. And how had he repaid her? By treating her like hired help, counting down the days until he could be with the woman he actually loved.

If anyone owed anyone, the debt was his.

"Alexander," Isabella whispered, horrified. "You're protecting her?"

"I'm stating facts."

His phone buzzed. A glance at the screen—Grandfather. His stomach dropped.

He yanked the door open. Daniel Carter stood guard outside.

"Daniel, arrange extra security to escort Ms. Sinclair home."

"Yes, sir." Daniel motioned for Isabella to follow.

"Alexander! I don’t want to go—I'm scared!" She clutched his sleeve, her nails digging in.

"Don’t be. Avoid the media. I’ll handle the fallout."

He pried her fingers loose and shut the door. The call connected.

"Grandfather."

"Alexander Kingsley!" The old man’s roar rattled the phone. "You dare break our agreement? Is that Stirling girl so desperate to marry you that she’d pull this stunt?"

A pause. Then the lethal blow: "If you marry her, I’ll disown you."

Alexander exhaled slowly. "The leak wasn’t from me."

"Then it was her! She got impatient waiting for a proposal!"

"Isabella wouldn’t do that."

"Liar!" Grandfather’s voice cracked. "I won’t allow this. You’re fixing things with Evelyn!"

"That wasn’t our deal. After three years, you promised to respect my choice." Cold sweat slicked his palms. "Evelyn and I are over. Isabella is who I want."

"Fine! But mark my words—the day you regret losing Evelyn, don’t come crying to me!"

The line went dead. Alexander swallowed two painkillers dry, his hands shaking.

Daniel returned just as he slumped into his chair. "Sir, your headache again?"

"I’m fine."

"Those pills won’t fix it. Remember how Evelyn’s massages used to help? Maybe—"

"Drop it."

Daniel hesitated. "About the investigation you requested... I have news."

"Go on."

"The accounts spreading rumors about Evelyn... they were fed information by Ms. Sinclair."

Alexander’s head snapped up. "You’re certain?"

"Triple-confirmed." Daniel lowered his voice. "Think about it—the timing’s too perfect. Negative press about Evelyn floods in right after your engagement leaks? This was planned."

Alexander went very still. Then his shoulders sagged. "Why would she...?"

He knew Isabella loved him. Knew she resented Evelyn. But this?

"Scrub it. Every last trace. By sunset."

Isabella arrived home to a hero’s welcome. Her parents and Adrian Stirling beamed at her.

"Brilliant move!" Adrian crowed. "The second your engagement hit the news, our canceled orders came flooding back! Hotels are lining up to sign contracts!"

Her father clapped her shoulder. "You saved the family business."

After The Regal Palace chain abruptly returned their Vintage Elegance bedding line and severed ties, the industry had turned on them. Orders vanished overnight. Their solution? Tie the Stirling name to the Kingsley empire.

And it worked. Money was already rolling in.

But Isabella’s smile was brittle. "The business is saved, but Alexander is furious. And Grandfather Kingsley will never accept me now."

Adrian smirked. "Who cares? The old man’s on borrowed time. Once he’s gone, your aunt controls Frederic, you’ll be Mrs. Kingsley, and the Abernathy fortune is ours."

Her mother stroked her hair. "As long as Alexander loves you, nothing else matters. Your aunt proved that."

Isabella lifted her chin. This time, she would become Mrs. Kingsley.

No matter the cost.
###Chapter 15

The golden sunset painted the sky in fiery hues as the luxury car glided toward Windsor Estates. Inside, Alexander Kingsley leaned back in the leather seat, exhaustion lining his sharp features.

"Mr. Kingsley," Gordon cleared his throat. "We've handled the online trolls attacking Ms. Sinclair. Legal notices were sent - they won't dare repeat their actions."

He hesitated. "But the marriage rumors... that's trickier to contain."

Alexander remained silent, his gaze fixed on the passing scenery. His fingers twitched toward his phone for the fifth time since leaving the office.

What would he even say if she answered?

An apology for today's disaster?

The words stuck in his throat like shards of glass. A leaden weight settled in his chest, unfamiliar and suffocating.

As the estate gates came into view, Alexander suddenly straightened. "Pull over."

The car screeched to a halt. Before Gordon could question him, Alexander was already striding across the street toward a boutique clothing store.

"Timeless Reminiscence" - the elegant script above the door matched the logo on the suit box Isabella had given him.

The bell chimed as he entered. An elderly tailor with kind eyes approached. "Good evening, sir. Are you here for a fitting or collection?"

Alexander's voice came out rougher than intended. "About a month ago, did a young woman in her twenties commission a men's suit here?"

Recognition flashed in the tailor's eyes. "Ah, yes! The young lady with remarkable design skills. In forty years of tailoring, I've rarely seen such natural talent."

"Did she come here daily to work on it?"

"Religiously." The old man nodded. "From open till close, sometimes so exhausted she'd nap at the worktable. When I asked if it was for her father or sweetheart..." He chuckled. "She blushed and called him her 'beloved.' Must adore her husband tremendously to pour such love into every stitch."

Beloved.

The word struck like a physical blow.

"Her eyes would light up whenever she spoke of him." The tailor studied Alexander curiously. "If I may ask, how do you know about this?"

Alexander swallowed hard. "I'm that man."

The tailor's face transformed with delight. "A match made in heaven!"

Outside, the fading sunlight felt surreal against Alexander's skin. Like walking through a dream Isabella had crafted for him.

Could she truly have loved him?

Yet how could someone switch emotions so completely? Devoted one moment, then coldly moving to another man's embrace the next?

An unfamiliar hollowness spread through his chest.

"Mr. Kingsley!" Gordon's voice shattered his thoughts. "Since when do you shop at common boutiques? Your suits usually come from Savile Row!"

"Never mind. Let's go."

His phone buzzed insistently. Lucas Grant's name flashed on screen.

"What?" Alexander barked.

"Celebratory drinks tonight!" Lucas's teasing tone grated. "For your wedding... or divorce. Whichever applies."

"Piss off."

Lucas laughed. "Relax! My new club opens tonight. Been ages since we caught up. Has our friendship expired?"

Alexander exhaled sharply. "Fine. Tonight."

Meanwhile at the Fairhaven mansion...

Isabella carefully plated the gourmet dinner she'd prepared for Sebastian. Her brother's eyes widened at the spread.

"You shouldn't strain yourself," Sebastian fretted. "Kitchen fumes aren't good for your recovery."

Isabella waved him off. "I've cooked plenty of—" She caught herself too late.

Sebastian's fork clattered onto the table. "Tell me you didn't cook for that bastard daily for three years!"

"It's nothing," Isabella said lightly, though her smile didn't reach her eyes. "A wife's duty. But don't worry - those days are over."

Suddenly, the usually playful prosecutor pulled her into a fierce embrace. "Consider those years wasted," he murmured into her hair. "From now on, you'll be treated like the royalty you are."

9:00 PM sharp.

Lucas's new nightclub pulsed with energy, packed with Elmsworth's elite drawn by the Fairhaven heir's reputation.

A matte black Bugatti purred to the entrance. Sebastian emerged first, his casual attire a stark departure from his usual courtroom formality - no less striking for it.

Then the driver's door opened.

All heads turned as Isabella stepped out. The silver mini dress hugged every curve, catching the light with each movement. Her cascading waves and diamond tassel earrings completed the vision of effortless elegance.

Sebastian groaned, pulling her close. "Must you wear that? You're attracting every wolf in the place."

A dangerous smile curved Isabella's lips. "Let them try anything. I could use some stress relief."

Inside, Sebastian secured a VIP booth away from prying eyes, though it did little to deter admirers.

"Honestly, brother," Isabella swirled her martini, "bringing you was a mistake. A newly divorced woman needs distractions, not chaperones."

Sebastian snorted. "Club rats? You'd lower your standards that far?"

Upstairs in the exclusive lounge...

Lucas clinked glasses with Alexander. "Still dressed like you're chairing a board meeting, I see."

Alexander surveyed the club with disinterest. "Nightclubs are declining investments. This one won't last the year."

Lucas grinned. "Who cares? I've got money to burn!"

His attention suddenly snagged on the dance floor. "Now there's a vision! That woman moves like poetry in motion."

Alexander barely glanced up until Lucas forced his gaze downward.

His breath caught.

Isabella.

And the man beside her was unmistakably Sebastian.

The glass in Alexander's hand cracked.
###Chapter 16

"Who's that guy with the gorgeous girl? Don't tell me it's Cassian, the CEO of the K Group from Skyrim."

Jareth arched a brow. "I always heard Cassian was too high-class for parties like this. Didn't expect him to show up tonight."

No surprise Thaddeus and Jareth got it wrong.

Evadne had four brothers—all quadruplets. Cassian and Arnold, in particular, looked so alike they could be mistaken for each other at a glance.

"I'm green with envy. A bombshell like that should be mine. What's the point of being with Cassian? He's nowhere near as fun as I am!" Jareth was getting carried away.

Downstairs, Evadne flashed a honeyed smile at the man beside her.

Thaddeus felt a sharp pang in his chest.

That smile used to belong to him.

What pissed him off more? None of the scandals seemed to faze her. She was still out here, living her best life.

Meanwhile, he was drowning in stress, either putting out fires or figuring out how to explain himself to her.

"Maybe tonight's the night I sweep her off her feet. Don't care if she's Cassian's woman." Jareth licked his lips eagerly.

"Cut it out. She's my wife."

Jareth's eyes nearly popped out. "What?!"

"Ex-wife," Thaddeus corrected, the words like shards of glass in his throat.

"You're joking! That's your ice-queen ex? Are you blind or just stupid? She's a knockout—way hotter than your precious Acacia!"

Thaddeus shot him a glare sharp enough to silence a room. Jareth instantly clammed up. "I only said that because I saw her. You never let me meet her before—thought she'd be some dragon lady. Didn’t expect—hey, where are you going?!"

Before he could finish, Thaddeus stormed out.

On the other side of the room, Evadne and Arnold had already downed three drinks. Her cheeks were flushed, her eyes glazed.

"Evadne, you okay?" Arnold asked, eyeing her swaying form.

"Another round! Let's play dice!" Her tolerance was decent, but annoyance had sped up the buzz.

Just then, Arnold's phone rang—an urgent call he couldn't ignore. "Wait here. I'll be right back."

Evadne waved him off. "Sure, sure."

The second he left, the vultures circled.

She lazily scanned them—too short, too scrawny, crooked nose, beady eyes.

None of them held a candle to her ex.

Pity the pretty face came with a hollow heart.

Then she spotted a group of rich brats in the corner. One of them—Acacia's sleazy brother, Ives—was pouring drinks for a girl.

Her sharp eyes caught the moment one of them slipped something into a glass and passed it to Ives.

Rage ignited. She marched over.

"Whoa! Look who's here!" The guys leered.

Ives immediately lost interest in the girl in his arms.

"Having fun? Mind if I join?" Evadne's voice dripped honey, her gaze smoldering.

"Sweetheart, I'll play whatever game you want." Ives licked his lips.

Evadne picked up the spiked drink. "Simple. Drink this."

Silence. Ives' greasy face darkened.

Everyone knew what was in that glass. Only an idiot would drink it.

"Not thirsty? Let me help you."

With a flick of her wrist, she tossed the entire drink in his face.

Gasps erupted. The girl beside him shrieked and scrambled back.

"You bitch! Do you know who I am?" Ives roared, wiping his face.

"Don't care. Your mouth reeks, you roofie girls, and you're lower than dirt." She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, her stare icy.

Ives saw red. This woman had the nerve to insult him?

If not for the crowd, he'd have dragged her out by her hair.

He shot a look at his two bodyguards. "Take her."

He'd teach her a lesson—after he had his fun.

The guards lunged. Evadne, tipsy but nimble, dodged, sending them crashing into each other.

"Too slow." She yawned.

"Grab her!" Ives bellowed.

One guard reached for her shoulder—

A tall figure stepped between them, seized the guard's arm, and flipped him onto the floor like a ragdoll.

"Nice move!" Evadne hiccuped, then stumbled backward.

A strong hand caught her waist. Warm breath brushed her cheek.

"Mmm... hands off!" She squirmed.

"Evadne. Look at me."

That voice—cold, magnetic, unforgettable.

Her pulse spiked as she tilted her head up. Thaddeus' piercing gaze locked onto hers, dark and unreadable.

His eyes dropped to her lips, red and tempting. If not for her dazed innocence, he'd hardly believe this was the same woman he'd married.

"Getting bold, aren't you? Think Cassian's backing means you can cause trouble anywhere?"

"Got a problem with that?" She smirked, her tone teasing. "Every time I see a Stirling, I itch to slap them. Your opinion means nothing to me."

His grip on her waist tightened—a silent warning.

"Ow—let go!" She wriggled, her voice soft, slurred.

Thaddeus' jaw clenched.

"Ives, watch your mouth. Acacia and I aren't married yet." Thaddeus' tone was lethal.

Ives choked.

Evadne's stomach turned at the mention of Acacia.

Three years of marriage, and he'd never once called her sweetly.

The thought made her shove him away, swaying on her heels.

"Apologize to her." Thaddeus' command was absolute.

His words were for Ives, but his eyes stayed on Evadne.

"She attacked me! She should apologize!" Ives spat.

Thaddeus' gaze turned glacial. "Show some respect. She's my ex-wife."
###Chapter 17

Nathaniel's jaw nearly hit the floor. So this stunning woman was Alexander Kingsley's secret ex-wife?

Honestly, she outshone his sister by miles.

If it weren't for their childhood sweetheart history, his sister wouldn’t stand a chance next to her.

"Mr. Kingsley, just because she’s your ex doesn’t mean I owe her an apology!" Nathaniel clenched his fists, pride flaring. "If she apologizes first, maybe I’ll consider letting this go!"

"If I’d been any later, your men might’ve crossed a line." Alexander’s voice was ice. "Just because they didn’t doesn’t absolve you. Apologize. Now."

Nathaniel’s stomach twisted, but he kept his composure. Isabella’s cheeks were flushed from the alcohol, her mind fuzzy. All she caught were words like "ex-wife" and "apologize"—and the audacity of this guy demanding she bow her head? She’d be generous not to kick his teeth in.

"Apologies are tedious," Lucas drawled, stepping forward with a smirk that screamed danger. "How about we handle this the old-fashioned way? Either we call the cops or teach him a lesson."

"Why would you beat me up? Is this a joke?!" Nathaniel’s voice cracked when he recognized Mr. Grant.

Lucas snapped his fingers, and the terrified girl who’d been nearly drugged cowered behind him.

"First rule: Our girls serve drinks and dance. Nothing more. Getting them drunk? Violation. Second rule: No drugs. Break it, and I break you." His grin turned lethal. "You should be thanking Ms. Sinclair. If she hadn’t stopped you, you’d be crawling out of here."

Alexander stiffened. So that’s what happened.

"Bravo!" Isabella hiccuped, giving Lucas a wobbly thumbs-up.

"Flattered." Lucas winked.

Watching them, Alexander’s chest burned with something ugly.

"Alexander, my solution acceptable?" Lucas arched a brow.

"Fine." The word was clipped.

"I—I’m sorry! Mr. Kingsley, I didn’t know she was your ex! I’m blind, stupid—Ms. Sinclair, please forgive me!" Nathaniel forced the words through gritted teeth, seething inside.

Alexander wasn’t satisfied, but then—Isabella was gone.

"Looking for her?" Lucas whistled, pointing to the stage.

Alexander’s pulse spiked. Under the spotlight, Isabella moved with wild, intoxicating grace, laughing like a carefree spirit. She glowed brighter than the lights themselves.

Drunk and euphoric, she swayed, lost in the music—until she tipped backward.

Gasps erupted as strong arms caught her. Blinking up at Alexander’s stormy expression, she giggled, "Gonna puke."

He hauled her into the men’s restroom, where she retched violently. Even beauty looked wretched in moments like this.

At first, Alexander just watched coldly. But seeing her tremble, he stepped closer, rubbing her back in slow circles.

Finished, Isabella staggered to the sink, splashing water on her face. "Ugh... worst ever."

"Serves you right for drinking," he muttered.

"Because... I’m sad." Her voice cracked.

Still drunk, she mistook him for her brother and burst into tears. "Why doesn’t Alexander want me? Why?"

His heartbeat stuttered.

"I tried so hard... but the harder I try, the more he hates me!"

Suddenly, she flung herself against him, sobbing into his shirt. He stood frozen, every tear scalding his skin. Finally, he whispered, "Do you... really love him that much?"

She lifted her tear-streaked face, lips parted. Alexander swallowed hard, regret gnawing at him. What did it matter?

They were divorced. His heart belonged to Victoria.

The door slammed open.

"Alexander! You disgust me!" Arnold roared, eyes blazing. He yanked Isabella away, shielding her.

Alexander’s jaw tightened. Seeing the usually composed Mr. Sinclair so protective of his ex-wife—proof of how much he cared. His chest ached.

"Sebastian, she can’t hold her liquor. If you cared, you wouldn’t have brought her here."

Arnold bristled but played along at the name. "My woman does what she wants. If she parties, I party with her. Since you’re divorced, back off. Go tend to your precious Victoria!"

He moved to leave, but Alexander blocked them. "What do you want?"

"Do you love her?"

"Obviously."

"Can you marry her?"

Arnold choked. She’s my sister, you idiot!

"None of your business!" he snapped.

"Isabella doesn’t have connections. She can’t handle messy entanglements. If you won’t marry her, don’t drag her down. Let her go." Alexander’s eyes flashed.

Arnold laughed bitterly. "You hypocrite. Did you consider her feelings when you divorced her for Victoria? You made her a divorcée at twenty-three! If you knew you’d leave, why marry her? Just to use her as a stepping stone? You’re vile."

Alexander flinched, pain lancing through him.

Arnold shoved him aside. "Get lost, bastard!"

Alexander didn’t remember returning to his booth. Lucas leaned against the railing, swirling his drink. "Your ex left?"

"Yeah." Alexander downed his whiskey, the burn nothing compared to the ache in his chest.

"Without you, I’d have broken Nathaniel’s legs. Drugging her? Touching what’s mine? He’s lucky to walk out alive."

"Do what you want. Victoria and her brother are separate." Alexander frowned. "Yours?"

"Good things should be kept. Since you don’t want her, I will." Lucas smirked. "Though her title changes from wife to sister. Can you handle that?"

Alexander’s smile was deadly. "Our divorce isn’t finalized. Eager to show your true colors?"

"The papers are signed. How long until it’s official?"

"I don’t know about much." Alexander clenched his fists. "But your funeral? That’s imminent."

The next morning, Isabella woke up—and promptly vomited again.
###Chapter 18

"You used to hold your liquor like a champ. What happened?" Adrian swiftly handed her a glass of water and some painkillers.

"Three years sober—who can handle this much alcohol all at once?" Isabella knew Alexander despised the smell of liquor on women, so she'd abstained throughout their marriage.

"Honestly, if I didn't know you were drunk, I'd think you were pregnant," Adrian teased.

"Ha. What would you all do if I was carrying Alexander's child?" A shadow of pain flickered in her eyes.

"What could we do? Raise the kid with you. Blood doesn't matter—the child would be innocent." Despite his disdain for Alexander, Adrian had a lawyer's unwavering sense of justice.

"Relax. Alexander would never let me bear his child." Isabella scoffed, sipping water to clear her throat.

"By the way, do you remember last night?"

"I remember picking a fight with Victoria, then Alexander showed up...? After that, it's a blur."

"Really don’t remember?"

"I think... I saw a ridiculously hot guy who helped me out? Damn, I was too wasted to get his number."

"That was Julian. We were at his new club."

Hearing the name, her interest evaporated. "Pass. That man’s a walking red flag."

"Did you know Alexander dragged you into the men’s restroom?"

Isabella’s eyes widened. "What?"

"No clue what happened in there, but when I walked in, you were hugging him and wiping your nose on his shirt." Adrian shuddered at the memory.

She gasped.

"Sis, if I hadn’t shown up, Alexander might’ve—"

"Stop. He’s not that kind of man." She massaged her temples irritably.

"You’re still defending him?"

"I’m not. He’s cold, unromantic, and hates me, but he’s not a predator." The words left a bitter taste.

"Funny thing—last night, he asked if I’d marry you. Told me not to play with your feelings, called you a 'delicate flower.'" Adrian smirked. "Since when does he care about anyone’s love life?"

"Wait. Why would he say that to you?"

"He mistook me for Oliver. I played along and told him to back off my woman. Bet he’s fuming."

"You’re insufferable." Blushing furiously, Isabella punched his arm.

Nathaniel whipped up a hearty breakfast, knowing she’d overdone it last night. Crispy bacon, golden eggs—the works.

Isabella descended in a silk robe, hair tousled. Even in sleepwear, she exuded effortless allure. Nathaniel flushed and averted his gaze.

"Hey! Two grown men live here. Have some mercy!" Adrian groaned, pressing a cold egg to his bruised face.

"Three years of white dresses and sneakers—I’m done. I’ll wear what I want, when I want." She bit into toast defiantly.

"Why only white dresses for three years?" Nathaniel frowned.

"None of your business!" they snapped in unison.

Makeup applied, sleek white blazer donned, Isabella strode into the hotel office—head pounding like a drum.

Sipping coffee, she replayed Adrian’s words. Had Alexander actually worried about her last night?

Don’t be naive. He just hates seeing his discarded toy in someone else’s hands. She wouldn’t fall for his mind games again.

Her phone buzzed—a message from the Ashbourne Intelligence Unit.

Cassius: Negative press about you was scrubbed. Alexander handled it.

Isabella: How generous.

Elvis: Deleting articles won’t fix this. Pathetic.

Beth: Abernathy stocks barely dipped. Disappointing.

Adrian: Can’t touch him yet, but let’s ruin the Sterlings first!

Isabella: Patience. Revenge is a dish best served publicly.

"Nathaniel, my office."

He entered promptly. "Yes, Miss Sinclair?"

"The documents I requested—ready?" She spun her chair lazily.

"Prepped. We can file anytime."

"Not yet." Crossing her legs, she tapped her diamond bracelet—a gift from Grandfather. "Leak it to our media allies. Let the public chew on it first."

"But going public complicates things. Why not strike fast?"

"Where’s the fun in that?" Her smile turned glacial. "I want the Sterlings desperate. And when they beg Alexander for help?" She exhaled sharply. "That’s when the real game begins."

That evening, prime time:

BREAKING: K Group SEVERS TIES with Sterling Furniture Over Quality Scandals!

The Sterlings scrambled as social media erupted:

"Vintage Elegance line is garbage!"

"Thaddeus’s fiancée’s family is fraudulent!"

"Canceled my order—this is disgusting!"

In his study, Alexander listened as Gordon detailed the PR nightmare.

"The Ashbournes wield immense influence. Their boycott is a death sentence." Gordon smirked. "Thank God the Sterlings aren’t public—their stock would’ve tanked."

Alexander’s glare silenced him.

"These allegations lack proof. How did this start?"

"Rumor says the new GM at Elmsworth Hotel axed the Sterling contract. Within days, every K Group property followed."

"A hotel manager has that power?"

"Not just any manager. Emeric’s daughter—Isabella."

Alexander’s grip tightened on his glass.

Isabella.
###Chapter 19

"That name—Evadne... I've heard it somewhere before." Thaddeus pressed his fingers against his temples, murmuring under his breath.

"I did some more digging on this Ms. Evadne."

For a fleeting moment, Thaddeus felt a surge of relief. Maybe his usually incompetent secretary had finally decided to do his job properly. His eyes sharpened with interest. "Tell me what you found."

"The result? Absolutely nothing." Gordon threw his hands up in defeat.

"Gordon, I think you're ready to collect your final paycheck tomorrow." Thaddeus's expression darkened instantly.

"Mr. Thaddeus, don't fire me yet! It's not that I didn't try—Ms. Evadne's information is locked down tighter than a classified government file. I swear I exhausted every resource!" Gordon's face paled, sweat beading on his forehead. "Isn't it bizarre? She's the sole heiress of Chairman Emeric Ashbourne, filthy rich, yet there's nothing about her online. No social media, no interviews—nothing. Is she a ghost or something?"

"Do we at least have a photo of her? Show me."

"Oh, yes! And let me tell you, it took blood, sweat, and tears to find this." Gordon pulled out his phone and handed it over.

Thaddeus took one glance and his face flushed with fury. "Gordon, are you trying to get yourself fired?!"

On the screen was a grainy, decades-old photo of a little girl, no older than five, cradled in Emeric's arms. How was he supposed to recognize anything from this? "Mr. Thaddeus, please don't kill me! This is literally the only photo of Ms. Evadne in existence. It's from twenty years ago—taken at Mrs. Ashbourne's funeral." Gordon gulped, feeling like he was balancing on the edge of a knife. Maybe he should start carrying a first-aid kit.

Twenty years ago. Evadne would be in her mid-twenties now. Around the same age as Isabella.

Thaddeus stared at the photo, his frown deepening. Why did the little girl in the picture remind him of Isabella? Ridiculous. He was divorced, yet his mind kept circling back to his ex-wife. What the hell was wrong with him?

Just then, a servant's voice interrupted from the doorway. "Mr. Thaddeus, the chairman requests your presence. He has matters to discuss."

In the grand living room, Elspeth was draped over Frederic's lap, weeping dramatically. A woman well past forty, yet she still played the fragile damsel, sobbing like a tragic heroine in a soap opera.

"Frederic... my poor sister. She married into the Sterling family, devoted her life to being a perfect wife and mother, and now this happens... When she called me, she was hysterical. She said she couldn't face me anymore, that she'd brought shame to the Abernathy name..."

"How could this be shameful? We're practically family now. There's no need to draw lines between us." Frederic's large hand stroked Elspeth's shoulder, his voice dripping with tenderness. "Wait until Thaddeus arrives. We'll find a solution together."

Over the years, Elspeth had masterfully manipulated her way into the Abernathy family, replacing Thaddeus's mother with her innocent facade. And Frederic? He was utterly smitten.

"Father, you wanted to see me?" Thaddeus strode in, his gaze icy.

"Thaddeus, you must help Acacia's family now!"

Elspeth dabbed at her tears delicately, her voice trembling. "Mr. Sterling and Acacia are both unwell. After this scandal, Acacia hasn't eaten or slept. If you truly care for her, you'll fix this immediately!"

"Thaddeus, have you uncovered the truth behind this?" Frederic asked, still comforting his wife while frowning.

"I have. The leak came from K Group's new general manager—a woman named Evadne."

Thaddeus lowered his lashes, unwilling to watch the sickening display of affection before him. In all his years, Frederic had never shown such warmth to him or his mother. He doubted the man even remembered his mother's face anymore.

"The Ashbournes of Skyrim?!" Elspeth gasped, covering her mouth. "They're the wealthiest family in Skyrim! How could my sister's family have possibly offended them?"

"The Ashbournes and Abernathys have been rivals for generations. Our ancestors had deep-seated grudges. The Ashbourne matriarch even swore that no Ashbourne would ever marry into the Abernathy line. Anyone who dared would be disowned, their name erased from history."

Thaddeus hadn't cared before—he was marrying Acacia, not an Ashbourne. But now, hearing this, an inexplicable chill slithered into his chest.

"Oh my God! The Ashbournes must be targeting the Sterlings to undermine our family! They heard about the marriage alliance and decided to strike first. How devious!" Elspeth twisted her handkerchief in fury.

"Thaddeus, you must meet with Ms. Evadne tomorrow and convince her to back off. This isn't just about the Sterlings—it's about the Abernathy reputation!" Frederic's tone brooked no argument.

"Frederic, don't be so harsh. Thaddeus has always been responsible. He'll handle it." Elspeth patted her husband's arm soothingly.

"I'm helping the Sterlings for Acacia's sake—not for you, Elspeth Frost Abernathy." Thaddeus's voice was glacial as he turned on his heel and walked out.

Elspeth's face whitened with rage. She was the Abernathy matriarch, yet this brat still addressed her by her full name. The disrespect!

"Hold it right there! How dare you speak to Elspeth like that? She's my wife—your mother! Have you forgotten your manners?" Frederic shot to his feet, livid.

Thaddeus paused but didn't turn back. "A man can have many wives, but only one mother. You know that. Don't force your delusions on me."

That evening, Cassius visited Evadne at Elmsworth. Over dinner, the conversation inevitably turned to Keith and the Sterlings.

"Dad knows about your decision. He didn't object—just said if the evidence is solid, justice should be served." Cassius deftly sliced Evadne's steak for her.

"Emeric is a disaster when it comes to women, but at least he's got principles in business." Evadne speared a piece of medium-rare steak.

"That's why all three of his wives still adore him. Aside from his wandering eye, he treats them well."

"Sure, the new flames get showered with affection, basking in his attention. Meanwhile, the old ones are left in the dust." Evadne's grip tightened on her fork, her eyes glinting with bitterness.

Cassius watched his sister's reddening eyes and gently ruffled her hair. "I know you don't hate his wives anymore. You just can't stand how unfairly Mom was treated. But have you considered... maybe she forgave him?"

"How could she? She just endured it. What woman in this world would willingly accept her husband's infidelity and be happy about it—"

Evadne's words died abruptly. Wasn't she the same? Knowing Thaddeus loved another, she had still given him everything—only to be discarded without a second thought.

Emeric might be a womanizer, but at least he never pretended to be anything else. Thaddeus? He never truly saw her in those three years, judging her with petty disdain. She'd been blind, loving that heartless man for thirteen years.

"Thaddeus has been quiet lately. He hasn't called." Cassius sipped his wine casually.

"Hmph. Too busy playing knight in shining armor for his precious Acacia and her family." Evadne swirled her wine, her eyes glinting like frost. "Isabella was too weak. This time, it's Evadne's turn."
###Chapter 20

The morning sun cast golden rays through the sleek windows of the penthouse as Alexander Kingsley adjusted his tie.

Dressed in a tailored navy suit that accentuated his broad shoulders, he exuded power with every step. His sharp gaze swept over the cityscape before he turned, ready to face the day.

The Regal Palace Hotel awaited.

Last year, he had dismissed it as mediocre—unworthy of his standards. But now, under Isabella Sinclair’s leadership, it had transformed into a beacon of luxury.

A worthy opponent indeed.

"Mr. Kingsley of Vanderbilt Industries is here to see Ms. Sinclair. Please inform her."

Nathaniel, his assistant, repeated the request three times before the executive secretary even acknowledged them.

"I'm sorry, but Ms. Sinclair doesn’t see anyone without an appointment."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "Does Alexander Kingsley need an appointment?"

The secretary arched a brow. "Doesn’t everyone?"

Nathaniel’s face flushed crimson. He was seconds from demanding to speak to a manager.

"Fine. When is she available today?" Alexander’s voice was ice.

"Ms. Sinclair’s schedule is full. Perhaps try again tomorrow."

Nathaniel nearly exploded.

Alexander placed a firm hand on his shoulder, silencing him. "We’ll make an appointment."

They left empty-handed.

Back in the car, Nathaniel slammed his fist against the window. "This is ridiculous! We’re in New York, not her damn kingdom! If she keeps this up, she’ll regret it!"

Alexander leaned back, eyes closed. "We’ll return tomorrow."

"And if she refuses again?"

"Then the day after. I will see her." His fingers loosened his tie, frustration simmering beneath his calm exterior. "The Sterling Group can’t hold on much longer. Without intervention, they’ll collapse."

The next day, they were turned away.

Again on the third.

Alexander Kingsley—a man who dined with presidents, whose name commanded respect—was being treated like an inconvenience.

It was infuriating.

That afternoon, rain poured as Isabella arrived at the hotel.

Her stiletto heels clicked against the marble floor, commanding attention. A fitted double-breasted suit hugged her curves, while golden rose earrings glinted with every step.

"God, our CEO is stunning! I’d die for her!"

"Since she took over, morale has skyrocketed. The men adore her, the women emulate her."

"Most beautiful heiress? No contest."

Under her leadership, the hotel had flourished. Discipline replaced chaos. Every department thrived.

Internal stability first—then external dominance.

"The Vanderbilts have secretly funneled funds into Sterling," Sebastian reported over the phone. "Bad press destroyed their orders. This money is a lifeline."

Isabella smirked. "Of course Alexander would save his wife’s family. How noble."

She massaged her sore ankle, slipping off her heels. "But money can’t fix a ruined reputation. He’s throwing cash into a sinking ship."

Sebastian chuckled. "You two are terrifyingly alike. If you ever teamed up, you’d rule the world."

"We’re not allies," she said coldly, popping a chocolate into her mouth. "We’re rivals."

Moments later, Preston stormed in. "Ms. Sinclair! Kingsley’s back! The man has no shame!"

"For love, he’ll debase himself. Admirable." Her tone was indifferent, but Preston caught the bitterness beneath.

"Let me handle him. I’ll make sure he never bothers you again."

"No." She capped her pen, meeting his gaze. "Let him in."

Preston gaped.

"He’s begged three times. It’d be rude not to indulge the great Alexander Kingsley."

She stretched out her foot, and Preston knelt to slide her heel back on. "Find me a waitress—pretty, poised. I have a role for her."

Ten minutes later, a starstruck waitress stood before her.

"Ms. Sinclair! I—I’m honored!"

Isabella smiled. "Relax. Do as I say, and you’ll be rewarded."

The girl blushed. "Just working for you is reward enough!"

A superfan. Perfect.

Isabella nodded to Preston. "Get her one of my outfits. And shoes."

Confused, he obeyed.

"What do you need me to do?" the waitress asked eagerly.

Isabella’s lips curved. "Alexander Kingsley is coming. You’ll meet him in my place."

The girl paled.

"Don’t worry. I’ll guide you through an earpiece. Just act natural."

Finally, after days of rejection, Alexander stood in the lobby, anticipation coiled tight.

The assistant led them to the elevator, women stealing glances at his striking profile.

Nathaniel reached for the button—only to be blocked. "This elevator is for Ms. Sinclair only. You’ll take the others."

Nathaniel scoffed. "Big deal."

Alexander remained impassive. He had his own private elevator at Vanderbilt Industries.

The ascent stopped at the 30th floor.

"Exit here," the assistant said.

Nathaniel frowned. "Her office is on the 40th."

"This elevator doesn’t go higher."

Alexander’s eyes narrowed. "Meaning?"

"Without Ms. Sinclair’s permission, no one uses her elevator. To reach the 40th floor, you’ll have to..."

Take the stairs.

Nathaniel exploded. "This is how she treats guests?!"

The assistant shrugged. "Her rules."

"Fine." Alexander strode out, jaw clenched.

Did Isabella think petty games would deter him?

Retreat wasn’t in his vocabulary.
###Chapter 21

"Mr. Kingsley, I can't—I can't go any further!" The Windsor Estates had towering floors and endless staircases. By the eighth floor, Preston was already gasping for air, his legs trembling like jelly. He looked ready to collapse.

"Two more floors. Keep moving." Alexander urged, climbing effortlessly.

At thirty-two, he was only two years older than Preston. But years in the special forces and relentless boxing training had honed his physique beyond most men's. Twenty more floors? Child's play. He'd done thirty-mile night marches in the military without breaking a sweat.

When they finally reached the fortieth floor, Preston slumped onto the steps, wheezing. Alexander shot him a cold, disappointed glance.

"Mr. Kingsley, what a pleasure." A smooth voice made Alexander turn. A handsome young man with bright eyes—the kind women gushed over—approached with a polite smile. His age was impossible to guess.

"Sebastian Lockwood, Ms. Sinclair's assistant. She's been expecting you. Follow me."

Was that a dig at their pace? Alexander's jaw tightened. "Unless your elevators move at the speed of light, Ms. Sinclair will have to endure our human limitations."

Sebastian didn't react, simply turning on his heel.

Rude.

"Tch. Attitude," Preston muttered, finally catching his breath. He tried to stand, but Alexander stopped him. "Wait here."

Alexander followed Sebastian to the CEO's office. His pulse quickened inexplicably. Battle-hardened, yet this meeting unsettled him.

A knock. A woman's voice.

"Enter." Sebastian opened the door with a stiff gesture.

Alexander straightened his tie and stepped inside. Meanwhile, in the adjacent room, Isabella watched the feed while nibbling chocolate.

A young woman sat behind the desk—elegant, long-haired, strikingly pretty. This was the infamous Isabella Sinclair? He'd expected someone more... regal.

"Mr. Kingsley, you must be exhausted. Please, sit."

Isabella's command through her headset made her "assistant" scramble to obey, his movements awkward.

Alexander settled onto the sofa, scanning the room.

The office was tastefully opulent—marble desk, vintage leather couch, a grand piano in the corner. But what caught his eye was the framed quote behind Isabella:

A wise man keeps his knowledge to himself, waiting for the right moment to act.

Impressive.

Isabella's chocolate paused mid-bite. In three years of marriage, he'd never complimented her. Not once. And now? When she'd stopped craving his approval?

"Do you like it?" she asked lightly.

"It's... well-chosen."

"Take it when you leave. A gift."

"No. Masterpieces belong where they're appreciated."

Isabella laughed—a sound her assistant nervously echoed.

Alexander frowned.

"Your praise flatters me, Mr. Kingsley. But I can mass-produce these. Really, take it." Her laughter held an edge now. His fingers curled slightly.

"Since you're not here to admire my decor, let's discuss business."

"I'm here about Vanderbilt Industries. Cease your attacks. We can negotiate terms." His voice dropped, gaze intense. "Cooperating with Kingsley Corp benefits you in New York, Ms. Sinclair."

"Attacks?" She chuckled. "I'm exposing unethical practices—warning peers against cutting corners. Buy cheap, pay dearly."

"Production flaws happen. Even century-old brands face recalls." He defended Vanderbilt stubbornly. "You could've demanded refunds. Instead, you smear their reputation. Using Ashbourne Group's might to crush mid-sized firms? Ruthless. Future partners might think twice."

Isabella crushed the chocolate in her hand. A threat? Did he think she'd cower?

"How noble—defending your fiancée's family. But business isn't personal. I won't spare Vanderbilt just because you're lovesick, Mr. Kingsley. Not even for New York's golden boy."

His expression darkened. She'd struck a nerve. Normally, he'd never dirty his hands with this mess. But for Evelyn...

"Seems we're at an impasse." He stood gracefully, every inch the unshakable soldier. "Pardon any future offenses in the boardroom, Ms. Sinclair."

As he turned to leave—

"Ms. Sinclair, I was wrong! If this gets out, I'm ruined!"

"It was Mr. Vanderbilt's idea! I just went along!"

Alexander froze. The recording exploded in his skull like a grenade.

Isabella crossed her legs, savoring his pallor.

"I support ethical businesses. But those harming collective interests?" She smiled. "I'll slay dragons without mercy. We'll meet again... in the boardroom."

Alexander left in a daze, nerves screaming, body numb.

"Sir! What happened? Did she agree?" Preston rushed over, alarmed by his ashen face.

"Later." Alexander strode forward, headache pounding, replaying her words.

That recording made him a fool. He'd thought Vanderbilt innocent—persecuted over his engagement leak. Instead, he'd championed vipers.

Yanking his tie loose didn't help. Then—high heels clicking behind him.

Evelyn?

He whirled around. The hallway was empty.
###Chapter 22

Isabella Sinclair strode back into her office, where the young waitress was still visibly shaken, her knees knocking together like castanets.

"Oh my god! Mr. Alexander is just... too much. That commanding presence made my cheeks burn crimson the moment I laid eyes on him." The girl pressed trembling hands to her flushed face. "I didn't mess up, did I, Ms. Sinclair?"

"You performed admirably."

Isabella slid a thick envelope across the desk. The waitress' eyes widened at its weight.

Just then, Daniel Carter entered with a document - a confidentiality agreement.

"You've been very helpful," Isabella said with a polished smile that didn't reach her eyes. "But let's make this official. What transpired here today stays between us. If word of my discussion with Mr. Kingsley leaks from any other source..." Her manicured finger tapped the contract meaningfully.

The waitress signed hastily, bobbing her head like a dashboard ornament before scurrying out.

"That Alexander Kingsley," Daniel mused, shaking his head. "Rumor has it he's impossible to read. If this were medieval times, he'd be the kind of king who'd execute messengers for bad news. What do you think, Ms. Sinclair? Ms. Sinclair?"

Isabella snapped out of her reverie with a humorless chuckle. "How touching. It seems Mr. Kingsley is truly smitten with Ms. Sterling. Willing to debase himself for his precious fiancée."

"Word is he treated his ex-wife like dirt though. So this Ms. Sterling must have hit the romantic jackpot—"

The sharp crack of Isabella's palm meeting the desk cut him off mid-sentence. Daniel froze, uncertain what nerve he'd struck.

"If negotiations with Kingsley fail," he backtracked quickly, "what's our next move?"

"We wait."

"For?"

"For the Stirling Group to crack under pressure and send Ives scrambling to explain their shoddy products. When they're most desperate to save face..." A predatory gleam lit Isabella's amber eyes. "That's when we strike the killing blow."

"You think Kingsley might still intervene?"

"Not a chance." Isabella's gaze drifted to the framed advertisement design Alexander had once praised. "He helped them blindly before. Now that he sees their true colors? He'll protect his precious Abernathy Group interests and his darling fiancée. Nothing else matters to that man."

She remembered how Alexander had begged three times for his beloved, endured humiliation, climbed ten flights in a storm—yet couldn't be bothered to fetch a glass of water for his wife when she'd been doubled over in pain.

The memory drew a bitter laugh from her lips, eyes suspiciously bright.

"Alexander Kingsley, your devotion to Evelyn Sterling is truly a public service."

Outside, the weather mirrored Alexander's mood—gray skies had given way to a downpour. The car's atmosphere was funeral-thick as he massaged his throbbing temples.

"Sir, what exactly happened back there?" Gordon ventured cautiously. "In all my years with you, I've never seen any negotiator leave you this... unsettled."

Alexander's mind flashed to childhood photos of Isabella—that bright-eyed girl bore no resemblance to the razor-sharp woman he'd just faced. People change, of course, but this felt... different.

"Dig into the Stirling-Ashbourne conflict. Full background on the Stirling executives. I want answers yesterday."

Back at Kingsley Corp, mountains of paperwork and meetings did little to distract him. He'd assumed that after the divorce, his relationship with Evelyn would flourish, that his heart would finally find peace. Instead, he felt only a growing emptiness.

A sharp rap at the door interrupted his thoughts. Gordon rushed in with a file.

"Sir, I've uncovered something peculiar. K Hotel terminated their contract with Stirling nine days ago—before Ashbourne went public with the quality allegations."

Then Evelyn announced their engagement, smeared Isabella's reputation, and Ashbourne dropped their bombshell—a perfectly timed sequence.

Alexander's jaw clenched as he fumbled for painkillers. The pills barely dulled the ache.

"Apparently some deputy manager at K Hotel—Keith—was taking kickbacks from Stirling to swap quality materials for cheap knockoffs. Ms. Sinclair caught him red-handed and fired him on the spot. Man had worked there twenty years, handpicked by her father. She's got ice water in her veins, that one." Despite their earlier confrontation, Gordon sounded impressed.

"These events... they're connected. I can feel it."

As Alexander rubbed his temples, the phantom click of heels echoed in his memory. Isabella's footsteps.

"Alexander, please stop taking those pills. Let me massage your temples instead."
"Your pain is mine. Let me help carry it."

Her gentle words haunted him. For a dizzying moment, he could almost feel her fingers at his temples again. Damn it—he was hallucinating now? Since when did Alexander Kingsley, the man who prided himself on emotional control, start pining for a relationship he'd never valued?

Night had fallen when the Rolls-Royce glided through rain-slicked streets near K Hotel. Alexander had always admired this prime Ashbourne property—valued at nearly ten billion, it could have been Elmsworth's only six-star hotel if not for past mismanagement. Under Isabella's leadership, it was undergoing a remarkable renaissance.

At a red light, Alexander wiped condensation from the window. His breath caught—a woman stood roadside, umbrella in hand, hailing a cab. Something about her posture made his pulse spike. Before Gordon could react, Alexander was out the door, sprinting through the downpour.

"Sir! What the hell—?"

The woman had just grasped a cab door handle when a large hand clamped around her wrist. She turned, face draining of color.

"Mr. Kingsley?"

"Ms. Sinclair." Rain plastered his hair as his grip tightened. "Need a ride?"

With a startled yelp, she wrenched free and dove into the cab, which sped away.

Gordon arrived, panting, umbrella in hand. Alexander stood motionless in the rain, chest heaving.

"Isabella Sinclair," he growled through clenched teeth. "You damn fraud."
###Chapter 23

The moment Alexander returned to Windsor Estates, he was drenched from head to toe, looking like he'd been dragged through a storm.

Olivia rushed forward with a towel, but he brushed past her without a word, his expression thunderous as he stormed upstairs.

"What happened to Mr. Kingsley? Did someone upset him?" Olivia asked Daniel, her face creased with concern.

"If you've got a moment, Olivia, go check on him. He's just been played for a fool."

"Played? Who could possibly outsmart Mr. Kingsley? Should we call the authorities? We need to report this!" Olivia's voice rose in alarm.

Daniel shook his head grimly. "No, this is beyond the police. Some people are just too cunning."

"I always warned Mr. Kingsley to be cautious, but he wouldn't listen. Overconfidence can be dangerous."

A bitter smile crossed Daniel's face. This time, Alexander had met his match.

The financial loss was bad enough. But the real blow was to Alexander's pride.

When he reached the top of the stairs, his face was ashen, his energy completely drained.

"Mr. Kingsley, Ms. Sterling is waiting in the study with Mr. Blackwood," a servant informed him.

Lips pressed into a tight line, Alexander entered the study.

"Alex! There you are!" Victoria rushed to embrace him, clinging like ivy.

Alexander didn't return the hug immediately, leaving her arms awkwardly suspended.

Tonight, her presence made his skin crawl.

"Alexander, how did the meeting with President Dubois go?" Reginald asked briskly.

As chairman of the Vanderbilt Group, he shouldn't have been micromanaging such minor affairs.

But Arabella had nagged incessantly, forcing his hand to pressure Alexander.

"I trust Alexander completely," Arabella purred, entwining her arm with her husband's. "He'll move heaven and earth to protect Victoria's family. After all, he adores her. If he speaks to Ms. Sinclair, how could the Dubois family refuse? The Vanderbilt name carries weight. Crossing us would be disastrous for them in New York."

Her manipulative tactic was transparent - inflate expectations first, ensuring any failure would infuriate Reginald and widen the rift between father and son.

"Father, Arabella, let's drop the matter regarding the Sterling Group." Alexander's voice was flat, his eyes empty.

"Alexander, what do you mean by that?" Reginald's brows knitted together.

"From now on, I won't be assisting the Sterling Group. That's final."

With that, Alexander turned on his heel and left.

Reginald, Arabella, and Victoria stood frozen, their faces masks of shock.

"Reginald, he's joking, right?" Arabella's smile stiffened as unease coiled in her stomach.

Reginald's expression darkened, but he remained silent.

Alexander returned to his bedroom, still soaked, too numb to change or shower. His mind replayed every moment of how Isabella had deceived him.

Why hadn't she faced him directly? Was it guilt? Or did she consider him beneath her notice?

"Alex! Why won't you help us?" Victoria followed, clutching his arm desperately. "All our orders are canceled! Inventory's rotting in warehouses! We can't even pay salaries! The Sterling Group will collapse!"

Her usual gentle facade had shattered, revealing only naked self-interest.

Exhaustion weighted Alexander's voice. "It's late. Daniel will drive you home."

"Alex! What changed your mind? Tell me!" She shook his arm violently.

He lacked the energy to explain. How could he admit his own miscalculations had left him empty-handed?

Then his heart lurched.

The suit box that had sat neatly by his bed was gone.

Alexander wrenched free, searched frantically, then barked, "Olivia!"

"Yes, Mr. Kingsley?" She appeared instantly.

"Where's the suit box that was beside my bed?"

"I didn't touch it! You instructed me never to handle Mrs. Kingsley's gifts when cleaning. And when Ms. Sterling visited earlier, I specifically warned her not to touch that box." Olivia's pointed glance at Victoria was deliberate.

She'd intentionally used "Mrs. Kingsley" to provoke Victoria into confessing.

"I threw it away." Victoria finally admitted, defiance flashing in her eyes.

"Where?" Alexander's voice dropped dangerously.

"Alex, why obsess over some trash she gave you? You're divorced! I'm your fiancée now! How could you treasure her gift more than me? Have you considered my feelings?"

Tears welled in her eyes, a performance straight from her aunt's playbook.

"One last time. Where is it?"

Alexander wiped her tears away mechanically, his cold detachment frightening the tears right out of her.

"The backyard dumpster."

Alexander plunged back into the rain, rolling up his sleeves to dig through the refuse for the discarded box.

"Alex! Stop! It's disgusting!" Victoria shrieked from the terrace.

Disgusting?

Perhaps the Vanderbilts didn't know he'd been an illegitimate child, scavenging streets with his mother at five years old. He'd rummaged through filthier trash just to survive.

He'd been born in squalor. What was there to explain?

Finally, his fingers closed around the grime-smeared box. Relief flooded him.

Olivia arrived with an umbrella as he pried it open.

The next instant, his eyes burned crimson, his face draining of color.

The once-pristine suit was now shredded beyond recognition.

He turned toward Victoria.

She stumbled back, breath catching at the unfamiliar fury in his gaze.

Wordlessly, Alexander cradled the ruined box and walked past her.

"Alexander, do you love her? Do you regret the divorce?" Victoria mustered her courage, clinging to him.

"No." His voice was thick with confusion and something like shame.

"But you're furious over some stupid gift! Did you ever consider how it feels seeing reminders of your three years together? Don't my feelings matter?" she lashed out.

"What do you want from me?"

Alexander peeled her away, inhaling sharply. "I divorced her for you. Even under grandfather's pressure, I stood firm. But you destroyed her belongings, slandered her publicly, orchestrated online attacks. She's gone, yet you keep dragging her back. Enough."

His words doused her like ice water, humiliation seeping into her bones.

So he'd known all along.

"Alexander, I did it because I love you!"

His frown eased, but his expression remained frigid.

"Next time you need help, ask directly. If it's reasonable, I'll assist. But I won't tolerate manipulation disguised as love, or betrayal from those I trust. You announced our engagement to salvage your family business. This time, I'll overlook it. Don't let there be a next time."

With that, Alexander walked away decisively.

Victoria hugged herself, trembling with rage, murderous thoughts of Isabella consuming her.

Meanwhile, Isabella and Sebastian enjoyed the storm's symphony, wineglasses in hand by the floor-to-ceiling windows.

Her favorite opera played softly in the background.

"Miss, the waitress contacted me. Mr. Kingsley intercepted her tonight. He knows about the decoy."

Sebastian set down his glass, noticing her tired feet after a day in heels, and knelt to massage them.

"I knew he'd discover the ruse eventually. Just not this soon."

His skilled fingers worked the tension away as her eyes fluttered shut. "After we dismantle the Sterling Group, the Vanderbilts are next. Given Alexander's harsh words today, how could I possibly let that slide?"
###Chapter 24

Tears streaked down Isabella's face as she stormed out.

Behind her back, the household staff whispered that Ms. Sinclair was nothing but trouble. Every time she appeared, chaos followed, ending with her dramatic exit in tears. It was as if she treated the Kingsley estate like her personal stage for tragedy.

Alexander sat slumped on the sofa, his tailored suit torn and disheveled, lost in thought.

"Mr. Kingsley, it's late. You should drink some warm milk and rest."

Olivia entered with a steaming cup, sighing at the ruined suit. "What a waste."

Her meaning couldn't have been clearer.

"Next time Isabella comes, don't let her near my room, the study, or Evelyn's," Alexander muttered, exhaustion lacing his voice.

"Don't worry, sir. I'll handle her!"

Olivia nodded firmly. "I even locked Ms. Evelyn's room today. Who knows what Ms. Sinclair might have done if she got inside."

"Olivia, don't be harsh. Isabella isn't that terrible. I wronged her for three years, after all."

"And what about Ms. Evelyn? What did she do to deserve this? You divorced her—doesn't that count as wronging her too?" Olivia's voice rose in defense.

"I was forced into that marriage. She could have refused."

"So you're saying Ms. Evelyn brought this on herself?"

Alexander's lips pressed into a thin line.

"Fine. Get some rest. I'll leave you be."

Olivia turned on her heel, her expression icy as she carried the untouched milk away.

Alexander blinked, slightly stunned.

Was she... angry at him? He had actually wanted that milk.

Since when had Evelyn won over everyone close to him? She really was cunning.

Humiliated, Isabella returned home with disastrous news.

Without the Kingsley Group's support, the Sterling family was in shambles. Recovery seemed impossible now.

"Damn it! What the hell is Alexander thinking? He claims to love you, yet he won't lift a finger to help! Does he think he can just trample over the Sterlings?!" Nathaniel roared, hurling an ashtray across the room, his eyes blazing.

"Alexander does love me! He divorced Evelyn for me!" Isabella sobbed.

"He's just weighing his options! You're a Sterling—she's nothing but a country girl. Any idiot would choose you!"

Though meant as support, Nathaniel's words stung like an insult.

"Isabella, what changed? Why did Mr. Kingsley suddenly back out?" Mr. Sterling demanded urgently.

"I don't know! He met with President Lockwood today, and afterward, he refused to help us. Dad, brother—did you do something to anger him? He seems to despise us now."

"Could it be because of Evelyn?" Nathaniel feigned sudden realization.

"What are you talking about?" Isabella tensed at the name.

"I ran into that lunatic at the Montgomery family's new bar. Out of nowhere, Alexander showed up, defended her, and forced me to apologize to his ex-wife! What's that about?" Nathaniel seethed, humiliation still raw.

Isabella paled, dread coiling in her stomach.

Did Alexander actually have feelings for that woman? Was her worst nightmare coming true?

She couldn't let Evelyn make a comeback.

"Don't worry. Once you marry Alexander, everything will be resolved," Mrs. Sterling soothed, her gaze icy. "Evelyn is discarded trash—she's powerless. Right now, we need to salvage the Sterling Group's reputation and find a scapegoat. That's the priority."

"A scapegoat?" Nathaniel's eyes gleamed. "I know just the person."

The Sterling Group's reputation was in tatters, their once-thriving Vintage Elegance stores now nearly deserted.

Worse, Alexander had withdrawn his support. Without a solution, they'd collapse the moment Kingsley funds dried up.

Meanwhile, the Lockwood Group had gained public favor by exposing the Sterlings' substandard products, and attention toward the K World Hotel surged once more.

"I followed your orders and had Keith tailed after he left. Just as you predicted, he'd been in contact with Nathaniel multiple times!" Jason carefully applied oil to Evelyn's burgundy nails. "Your foresight is impeccable—you saw right through him."

"He embezzled from the hotel and conspired with Nathaniel. That proves their connection."

Evelyn smiled, pleased with Jason's meticulous care.

"This weekend, the Sterlings are holding a press conference. I'll make sure you have front-row seats to the show."

Evelyn was in high spirits today, inspecting the new mattresses that had arrived. She even personally checked the shipment at the back entrance with Jason.

"Ms. Lockwood, you really don't need to trouble yourself with this. The manager and I can handle it," Jason said gently.

"I'm no delicate flower. I've carried wounded soldiers under gunfire, saved hundreds on the battlefield. A few mattresses are nothing."

A shadow flickered in Evelyn's eyes as she spoke.

She had once saved Alexander on a foreign battlefield.

Amidst bullets and explosions, he had lain bleeding, his leg and shoulder torn open. He'd roared at her to leave him behind, but she had sworn to stay.

"Leave me! Go! I'm ordering you—get out of here!"

"Never! Even if I die here with you, I won't abandon you! We leave together!"

Back then, Evelyn had been prepared to die. For a woman her size, rescuing a man as tall and broad as Alexander from a warzone had seemed impossible.

At that moment, she had wondered—were they together?

In life, they shared hardship. In death, they'd rest in peace. No regrets.

Evelyn's lips twisted into a bitter smile, her heart pounding painfully.

Alexander. Even now, her scarred heart still beat for him.

It seemed meeting someone so extraordinary in one's youth was a curse.

Evelyn and Jason reached the back entrance just as workers began unloading.

The guest manager admired her even more for overseeing the process personally.

With Jason's help, Evelyn climbed onto the truck, inspected a mattress, then sat down, satisfied.

"Perfect. Proceed with unloading."

Just then, a blue Lamborghini roared toward them.

Luxury cars often passed by the back entrance near the garage—nothing unusual.

But this time was different.

Because the man behind the wheel was Lucas.

Lucas drove one-handed, his other arm draped around a sultry woman. After a night of partying, they were out for brunch. Bored, Lucas glanced out the window—

And spotted Evelyn helping unload mattresses.

Even in work clothes, her beauty was undeniable.

In the bar, she had been a delicate night rose. Now, she radiated effortless grace, her efficiency setting her apart from the pampered socialites he knew.

Lucas smirked, intrigued.

"Country girls really can do it all."
###Chapter 25

Lucas strode into the hotel restaurant with his date clinging to his arm.

The instant their meals were served, his companion whipped out her phone, snapping pictures like a paparazzo. Lucas scowled. "What’s this? Never seen steak before?"

She flushed, hastily tucking her phone away before picking at her food in silence.

When they finished, the manager approached with a polished smile. "Mr. Grant, did everything meet your expectations?"

"Excellent. The filet was perfectly seared. I’m impressed."

Despite his messy personal life, Lucas was still a Vanderbilt heir—his manners impeccable, his demeanor effortlessly aristocratic.

"Seriously? This tastes like shoe leather." His date slammed her fork down, the clatter drawing stares.

Lucas’s expression darkened, his eyes flashing with irritation.

"We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience," the manager said smoothly, bowing. "Your feedback is invaluable."

"Don’t mind her. She left her dentures at home. Can’t even chew pudding, let alone steak."

Her face paled. She didn’t dare retort.

Lucas pulled out a thick stack of bills from his wallet and slid it across the table. In an era of digital payments, he still carried cash like it was a flex.

"Keep the change. By the way—do you have an employee named Seraphina?" He propped his chin on his hand, gaze wistful.

"Mr. Grant, our policy prohibits accepting tips. And I’ve managed this restaurant for fifteen years—there’s no Seraphina on staff."

"Impossible." Lucas stiffened. "I saw her unloading supplies at the back entrance. Check again."

"I assure you, there’s no need. I know every employee personally." The manager excused himself with another bow.

As Lucas frowned, a striking figure glided into the restaurant.

Isabella.

Alone.

Their eyes met—hers cool, his widening in recognition. Three years married to Nathaniel, and he’d never once taken her out publicly. Yet she knew Lucas was Nathaniel’s closest friend. Polar opposites, but their bond was unshakable.

Thankfully, no staff were around to call her "CEO."

Lucas’s gaze locked onto her like a homing beacon.

His date noticed, jealousy twisting her features. The way he looked at this woman—like she was sunlight after a decade of rain—made her blood boil.

Isabella ordered coffee and settled at a corner table, scrolling through her phone.

"Ms. Sinclair. Fancy seeing you here."

She glanced up, her expression frosty. "Just on break. I work here."

Lucas smirked. He knew that already—he’d asked purely to hear her voice. Her bluntness was refreshing. No pretenses. His admiration grew.

"Nathaniel’s an idiot. A woman like you should be treasured, not stuck waiting tables." He traced his jawline lazily.

"Treasured?"

She laughed, sharp as shattered glass. "He kept me caged for three years. That’s not love—it’s imprisonment. I’d rather scrub floors than go back to that."

Lucas blinked. Her smile held knives.

"President Kingsley gave me a chance when no one else would. He respects my choices. So don’t insult him."

Lucas’s grin faltered.

"Your girlfriend’s waiting." Isabella jerked her chin toward his fuming date. "Shouldn’t you get back to her?"

"Girlfriend?" He scoffed. "One dinner doesn’t make her mine. Does a kiss mean we’re engaged?" His eyes gleamed. "Have dinner with me tonight. Name the place—I’ll book it."

"I have a boyfriend."

"Don’t care." Lucas never played by rules. "If you’re shy, we’ll go to my villa. Private. Three-Michelin-star chef."

Isabella’s fingers drummed the table. Where was her damn coffee?

Then Lucas’s phone rang. Nathaniel’s name flashed onscreen.

"Excuse me." He stepped away.

Her coffee finally arrived. Before she could sip it, his date stormed over, nostrils flaring.

"Listen, employee," she sneered. "Stay away from Lucas if you want to keep your job."

Isabella waved a hand in front of her nose. The woman’s perfume could suffocate a horse.

"Or what?" She didn’t even look up.

"I’ll complain to your manager!"

"Go ahead. Tell President Kingsley. He’ll laugh in your face."

"You—!"

The woman lunged for the coffee cup, but Isabella was faster.

Splash.

Scalding liquid hit the woman’s face. Her mascara ran in black rivers, her designer dress ruined.

Isabella dabbed a stray drop from her wrist with a napkin, smirking.

"Between us? Only one person was leaving humiliated. And it was never going to be me."

In the hallway, Lucas answered the call.

"Nate. What’s up?"

"Your mother’s birthday is in two days. Help me pick a gift tonight—I’m clueless."

"Please. She adores you. A rock would make her happy."

"Tonight. No excuses."

"Can’t. I’ve got plans."

"Cancel them."

"I promised her dinner. Not my style to stand people up."

Lucas weighed his options. He wasn’t a saint—but he wasn’t a backstabber either. If he wanted something, he’d take it openly.

"Fine. Heads up—my date tonight is your ex-wife."

Silence.

"Nate? You there?"

Nathaniel’s voice came through, icy.

"You’re with Isabella now?"
###Chapter 26

The words had barely left Thaddeus's lips when a chorus of shrieks erupted through the restaurant.

Jareth's mind instantly went to the woman he'd brought along—she wasn't the type to sit quietly. Pair her with Evadne, and chaos was inevitable.

"I'm a little tied up right now. Got a situation here. Let's catch up later, yeah?"

Just as Jareth was about to end the call, Thaddeus's voice sliced through the air like a blade. "Jareth. Where are you?"

Another wave of screams followed, even more piercing than before.

"K World Hotel. Restaurant."

Jareth rushed back inside.

The sight that greeted him shattered his expectations. Evadne had his date's hair gripped in one hand, her face pressed against the table, while her other hand pinned the woman's arms behind her back. It looked like something straight out of an action movie—a badass heroine taking down a criminal.

Jareth had worried Evadne might be the one getting bullied. Clearly, he'd underestimated her. Arms crossed, a smirk playing on his lips, he settled in to watch the show.

"I'll sue you! I'll ruin you! You won’t survive in Elmsworth!" His date's voice was muffled against the table, her features contorted in fury.

"Better hurry, then," Evadne said coolly. "The bruises will fade, and you won’t have proof."

Her expression remained blank. If the woman hadn’t tried to attack her, she wouldn’t have bothered laying a finger on her.

Spotting Jareth, his date whimpered, "Mr. Jareth! Help me!"

"Alright, that's enough." Jareth stepped forward and pulled Evadne away. His tone wasn’t angry—if anything, it sounded like he was scolding a misbehaving child.

He wasn’t fazed. He’d once had four women brawling in the street over him. The only issue here was that Evadne was his best friend’s ex-wife, and he didn’t want to embarrass Thaddeus.

"Mr. Jareth, enough?!" His date’s hair was a mess, her face flushed with rage. "She attacked me! She humiliated me! You have to do something!"

Evadne sat back down, unfazed, while Jareth’s gaze drifted from her long legs down to her delicate feet in those heels.

He had a thing for feet—always had. Maybe because he’d seen too many pretty faces. But Evadne’s? Perfect.

"Did you provoke Ms. Evadne?" Jareth asked, eyes still on her.

"Why should I apologize?!" His date’s face twisted in outrage.

"You like me. Ms. Evadne doesn’t. So it couldn’t have been her who started this."

Evadne arched a brow. At least Jareth had some brains—unlike his insufferable friend, Thaddeus.

"Mr. Jareth, how could you treat me like this? I’m your girlfriend!" She lunged to hug him, but he stepped back, disgusted, leaving her stumbling.

"Girlfriend?" His voice turned icy. "Says who?"

She choked on her next words.

"Apologize. Then get out. I don’t want to see you again."

Everyone in Elmsworth knew Jareth’s temper. When he smiled, he was dangerous. When he didn’t, he was lethal.

"I’m sorry," she muttered, face burning, before fleeing.

"Apologies for the scene, Ms. Evadne." Jareth forced a smile, looking almost sheepish.

"Since you made her apologize, I’ll let it go."

Evadne checked her watch—a Richard Mille, limited edition. Jareth, a collector, recognized it instantly. Cassius must’ve spoiled her rotten. He wouldn’t even part with one himself.

And here she was, wearing it while doing manual labor. Unbelievable.

"I need to get back to work," she said, standing. "Enjoy your meal, Mr. Jareth."

"Ms. Evadne, when do you finish? I’ll pick you up tonight."

"Don’t bother. You won’t get the chance."

Her rejection was swift, her eyes cold. "I won’t be having dinner with you."

Jareth sighed. "So decisive? After I taught Ives a lesson for you at Sapphire Nights? Not even a thank-you dinner?"

Evadne scoffed. "I recall it was Thaddeus who helped me. Taking credit behind your friend’s back? Classy."

"Ms. Evadne, have I offended you somehow?" Jareth’s gaze sharpened. "Is it because of Cassius? Does he even dare to claim you publicly? I would."

"Mr. Jareth, love isn’t first-come, first-served—but it does have standards." Her words hit like a slap. "I may not be noble-born, but I have pride. When I married Thaddeus, he was the only one in my heart. Now, with Cassius, I can tolerate simple meals—but I won’t tolerate someone messing with what’s mine. Respect yourself and stay out of my life."

The bitterness in her voice was palpable. Even Jareth saw the suppressed fury in her eyes, his own darkening in response.

Evadne inhaled sharply, regaining her composure, and turned to leave—only to freeze.

"Thad?"

Jareth blinked. How had he gotten here so fast? Did he fly?

Thaddeus stood at the entrance like a storm cloud, his presence turning the air frigid. The restaurant, already cool, now felt like an icebox.

Evadne met his piercing gaze.

God, his eyes were mesmerizing—slightly upturned, the corners tinged red. Once, they’d made her heart race. Now, they only ever held coldness. Three years of pouring her soul into this marriage, and the only one moved had been her.

Thaddeus strode toward her, jaw clenched. Hearing Evadne was with Jareth, he’d canceled his afternoon and driven here like a man possessed. And then he’d heard her words—words that hollowed out his chest, leaving only rage.

He rarely lost his temper. But with Evadne, control was impossible.

"Why are you here?" His voice was a blade.

"Working." She turned away.

"Have you forgotten? We’re still married until the divorce is finalized. You’re still an Abernathy. And the Abernathys and Ashbournes are enemies. Yet here you are, working at their hotel. What were you thinking? Trying to humiliate me?"

Jareth opened his mouth, but Evadne cut in first.

"So that’s what you think." Her gaze was icy as it locked onto his. "Then let’s finalize the divorce. That way, you won’t have to haunt me like a ghost, glaring at me like I’m some nuisance."

"Evadne!" His brows furrowed.

"You didn’t bring the papers, did you? Have Gordon send them over. I carry mine every day, just in case today’s the day."

Her smirk was infuriating as she brushed past him—no hesitation, no looking back.

Thaddeus’s eyes burned. He grabbed her arm, hard, as if afraid she’d vanish.

Then—

A sickening pop.

Evadne gasped, pain shooting through her. Sweat beaded on her forehead.

Thaddeus went rigid.

He’d just dislocated her arm.
###Chapter 27

"Jesus Christ! Nathaniel, have you completely lost it?!" Preston's eyes widened in shock.

Isabella's face drained of color, her delicate arms hanging limp at her sides, beads of cold sweat glistening on her forehead.

The contrast between Preston and Nathaniel's treatment of her couldn't have been starker - one tender and protective, the other harsh and unfeeling.

Nathaniel seized Isabella's fingers, squeezing them tightly before recoiling as if burned. His lips parted in stunned silence as he took a step back.

"Ms. Sinclair, your shoulder's dislocated. We need to get you to a doctor immediately." Preston's voice trembled with urgency, reaching for Isabella only to have her sidestep him with icy detachment. "I don't need your help."

"You can't possibly reset it yourself!"

"That's none of your concern."

Isabella's entire body vibrated with barely contained fury, her piercing gaze warning them both away. Every inch of her seemed electrified, untouchable.

Preston froze, hands hovering uncertainly.

Nathaniel studied his ex-wife - this trembling, furious woman who bore no resemblance to the placid wife he'd known. The realization struck him like a physical blow: he'd never truly known her at all.

Three years of marriage. Three years of gentle smiles and quiet acquiescence. Back then, her constant attempts to please had only fueled his resentment. The more she smiled, the deeper his disgust grew.

Now divorced, that smiling ghost had vanished. But this raw, furious version of Isabella? She'd never felt more alive.

"Stop deluding yourself, Nathaniel." Isabella drew a shuddering breath, eyes glistening. "Taking this job wasn't about wounding your pride. It was about survival after you discarded me - about building a new life. I can't understand why ending our marriage came so easily to you, yet you can't stand to see me move on. Is it really so impossible for you to let go? Or is it that you simply can't bear to see me thrive without you?"

Nathaniel's jaw tightened, an invisible weight pressing against his windpipe.

Her heart twisted at his silence. Swallowing the pain, she forced a bitter laugh. "Do you need to see me broken? Drowning in grief? Sorry to disappoint, Nathaniel. Those three years were my personal hell. Leaving you wasn't tragedy - it was emancipation. Don't contact me before Grandfather's birthday. I can't stand the sight of you." Turning sharply, she found the ache in her chest far eclipsed the pain in her shoulder. The injury meant nothing - she could've popped the joint back herself. But she needed this physical pain, needed to feel every nerve scream. Only then might the deeper wounds begin to heal.

Suddenly, strong arms encircled her waist. The world tilted as Nathaniel swept her off her feet.

"Put me down!" Isabella's cheeks burned as she thrashed against him.

His grip only tightened, his broad chest becoming an inescapable prison. Pressed against him, she could feel the rapid thud of his heart, could smell that familiar cologne she'd once loved.

The scent nearly undid her. How many nights had she sprayed it on her pillow just to sleep? Now those memories only fueled her resentment.

"We're going to the hospital. This isn't something you can ignore." Nathaniel's expression remained stoic, but his gaze burned. "Let go of me! You couldn't be bothered to touch me during our marriage - you've forfeited any right to do so now!" Her voice cracked with emotion.

Nathaniel marched forward, deaf to her protests.

Preston clicked his tongue, hurrying after them. "Honestly, you two are divorced but still tangled up like this. Let me help Ms. Sinclair—"

"Back off."

"Stay out of this."

They spoke in unison - one voice raw with tears, the other tight with barely restrained emotion.

Preston arched a brow. "Christ, you're still perfectly in sync."

Hospital

The sterile white walls of the clinic swallowed Isabella whole while the two men waited in tense silence outside.

"You could've snapped her arm like a twig, you know." Preston shook his head. "She's half your size."

"How did you find her working there?" Nathaniel's voice was dangerously quiet.

"Pure coincidence. Saw her hauling crates out back like some common laborer." Preston's lips quirked. "Never would've guessed she used to be a CEO's wife. There's something remarkable about a woman who can adapt like that."

Nathaniel's fists clenched. "Your standards must be pathetically low."

"Better than being blind to true worth."

The barb struck home. Nathaniel's vision swam red, his chest constricting.

"Honestly? I thought you two might reconcile," Preston mused.

"Not happening."

"You clearly still care. Why else rush over like your hair was on fire? The way you looked at her—"

"I said drop it."

Preston leaned against the wall, arms crossed. "Here's the thing, Nate. If you change your mind about marrying Vanessa, I'll back off. Out of respect. But if you marry her and still hover around Isabella?" His usually playful eyes hardened. "All bets are off."

Nathaniel's jaw worked silently.

"Nathaniel!" The shout echoed down the corridor.

He turned just in time for Preston's fist to connect with his cheekbone.
###Chapter 28

Thaddeus Kingsley had graduated from West Point and served three years in the Marines. Even now, as a businessman, his muscular frame was evident beneath his tailored suit. So when Nathan Prescott's fist connected with his jaw, he barely flinched, though a bruise darkened the corner of his mouth.

"Damn love rival," Lucas muttered under his breath, recalling Isabella's sharp remarks about his arrogance.

Nathan swung again, but Thaddeus dodged effortlessly.

"Thaddeus, didn't I warn you to stay away from Isabella? Are you deaf?" Nathan's chest heaved with fury, his eyes blazing. "If she gets hurt again, I'll make sure the Kingsley family pays for it."

"Mr. Prescott, you're overreacting," Lucas interjected nervously. "It's just a dislocated shoulder—"

"Just a dislocation?" Nathan scoffed, his voice dripping with venom. "You two—one treats women like playthings, the other like trophies. You'll never understand what she means to me. Isabella is the woman I love, the one I'll protect with my life. Keep your filthy hands off her!"

His words were raw, filled with a passion Thaddeus had never dared to express.

A flicker of surprise crossed Thaddeus' face. Since their divorce, Isabella had only grown more radiant, attracting men like moths to a flame—first Alexander, now Lucas.

The bitterness in his chest was unbearable. He had taken her for granted, and now others fought for her attention.

"Sue me if you want," Thaddeus said coldly. "But let me remind you—Isabella and I aren't officially divorced yet. She's still my wife, still a Kingsley."

Lucas winced. Thaddeus really knew how to twist the knife.

Nathan looked ready to spit in his face but restrained himself.

"Mr. Prescott."

A soft yet firm voice cut through the tension.

The three men turned.

Isabella stood alone, her left arm in a sling, her face pale but proud, like a delicate daffodil refusing to wilt.

Thaddeus' throat tightened.

The hallway stretched wide and empty around her. Her clear, innocent eyes shimmered, pure and untainted, stirring something deep within him—a distant, fragmented memory.

Isabella?

A sharp pain lanced through his skull, then vanished just as quickly.

Nathan rushed to her side, his voice rough with worry. "Are you in pain?"

"No. Let's go home."

She smiled at him, warm and intimate, making Thaddeus' chest ache.

Nathan wrapped an arm around her waist, guiding her away without so much as a glance at Thaddeus.

Thaddeus moved to follow, but Lucas stopped him.

"Don't. You've hurt her enough. You know who called Alexander, don't you? Don't humiliate yourself further."

Watching them disappear, Thaddeus clenched his fists until his knuckles turned white.

Sebastian arrived moments later, summoned by Nathan but still clueless.

"Miss Sinclair! What happened? Who hurt you?"

"That bastard Thaddeus," Nathan growled.

Sebastian's face darkened. "I'll kill him—"

Isabella cut him off. "No. You can't take him. He was Special Forces—you'd just get yourself hurt. Besides, he didn't mean to. He's always been rough."

Sebastian frowned. "You sound like you know him well."

Isabella hesitated, biting her lip. Sebastian didn't know about her past with Thaddeus. She wasn't hiding it—she just didn't want to relive it.

Back at the penthouse, Nathan brewed coffee while ranting about Thaddeus.

"I'm sorry," Isabella murmured.

Nathan blinked. "For what?"

"For dragging you into this. I didn't want you to think I was using you."

Nathan's expression softened. He pulled her into a careful hug. "Idiot. We've protected you since the day you were born. Next time you get married, we'll be your dowry." He paused, then added, "And if you never marry again, we'll still be here, guarding you forever."

Isabella almost laughed. Four brothers as dowry? Might as well join a convent.

——

Thaddeus couldn't focus during the afternoon meeting, barely listening as executives presented reports.

His grim expression kept the room tense. No one dared breathe too loudly.

Though an illegitimate heir, Thaddeus now ruled the Kingsley Group unchallenged. His half-brother was bedridden overseas, and his stepsisters were deemed unfit to inherit.

"Mr. Kingsley, the Farley Group's hotel in Wye—it's been acquired by another party," a nervous executive reported.

Thaddeus' gaze sharpened. "By whom?"

"The K Group. It'll be their second luxury hotel in Elmsworth."

Thaddeus' jaw tightened. "Why wasn't I informed sooner?"

"We were in final negotiations when Mr. Ashbourne swooped in. We never saw it coming."

"Almost isn't good enough." Thaddeus' voice turned icy. "That location is prime real estate—600 meters from the future Universal Studios. I wanted it secured at any cost. Your hesitation cost us dearly. Report to the Eldoria branch next week. One more mistake, and you're done."

He stormed out, leaving the room in stunned silence.

——

"Retaliation?" Gordon ventured on the drive home, eyeing the rearview mirror nervously. "First Ms. Sterling attacks Ms. Sinclair, then Mr. Ashbourne steals our project, and now the Sterling Group's scandal breaks—could he be behind it all?"

Thaddeus met his gaze in the mirror, and Gordon nearly choked.

"Pull over at the tailor shop ahead."
###Chapter 29

The Tailor's Dilemma

Sebastian Blackwood's imposing frame filled the tailor shop doorway like a storm rolling in.

The tailor glanced up from pressing a waistcoat, his eyes widening at the unexpected visitor. "Mr. Blackwood?"

"I need your help," Sebastian said urgently, placing a damaged garment box on the counter. "Name your price."

The tailor gasped as he lifted the lid. "Good heavens! What happened to this masterpiece?" His fingers trembled over the ruined fabric.

Sebastian's jaw tightened. "My fault."

"This was hand-stitched by the young miss herself," the tailor murmured, shaking his head. "She spent weeks perfecting every seam. Such a waste..."

"Can it be fixed?" Sebastian demanded.

"Impossible. The inner lining and outer fabric are both shredded. Even if I mend it, the scars will remain."

Sebastian's chest constricted. "Do what you can. Just make it wearable again."

The moment Sebastian returned to Kingsley Manor, tension thickened the air.

"Sebastian!" His half-sister Lillian rushed to him, wringing her hands. "Grandfather's here. He and Father are shouting in the study. You have to stop them!"

Sebastian frowned. "Over what?"

In public, Reginald Kingsley played the perfect heir—charming, obedient. For him to risk upsetting their ailing grandfather meant only one thing: Arabella Sinclair was involved again.

"Father wants to bail out the Sinclair Group," Lillian hissed. "But Grandfather refuses. It's absurd! Helping the Sinclairs helps us too, doesn't it? You're marrying Arabella soon—if this falls through, our family will be the laughingstock of New York!"

Sebastian's expression darkened as he took the stairs two at a time.

Upstairs, chaos reigned.

William Kingsley, wheelchair-bound at eighty, hurled a crystal paperweight at his son. "I told you to stay out of Sinclair affairs! Yet you're funneling our contracts to them? Have you lost your mind?"

Reginald shielded his weeping wife. "Father, please—"

"Don't 'Father' me! That woman has addled your brain since the day you married her!" William's face purpled with rage.

Arabella dabbed her eyes with a lace handkerchief. "I've devoted twenty years to this family. Never caused trouble, never asked for anything—"

"Because you got everything without asking!" William sneered. "Your sister's no honest businesswoman. She's a con artist reaping what she sowed!"

Arabella's tears froze mid-track.

Reginald intervened, voice strained. "This isn't just about Arabella. The Vanderbilts stole our Aetheria deal. Cassius Ashbourne sabotaged us abroad—"

Sebastian stiffened.

Cassius Ashbourne?

That was impossible.

He'd seen Cassius at the hospital hours ago.

Unless...

The man in the hospital wasn't Cassius at all.

But then—who was he?
###Chapter 30

Frederic finally gave his word—he wouldn't meddle in the Stirling family's business again. Only then did the matter come to a close.

He and Elspeth left, their expressions dark. Hamilton surveyed the wreckage around him, bitterness twisting his features. "We're cursed, I tell you. Every Abernathy man gets played by those conniving Acacia women."

Thaddeus knelt, picking something off the floor, his mind racing. Could someone have impersonated Cassius in Aetheria? But Frederic wasn't a fool—they'd faced off in business too many times. Unless age had dulled his senses, he wouldn't mistake another man for Cassius.

Then his fingers brushed against a folding fan. "Grandfather, is this yours?"

Hamilton's face softened instantly. "Ah, yes. Hand it here. This was made by Isabella—she painted and inscribed it herself."

She painted?

Thaddeus froze, as if his soul had been yanked from his body. When she was with him, she'd been meek, unremarkable. Compared to Acacia, who played piano, danced, and sang, Isabella had seemed ordinary—just a pretty face with no talents beyond obedience.

But once she left, she'd transformed. Like a pearl shaken free of dust, she shone. Talents he never knew she possessed surfaced one after another, leaving him blindsided.

Had she hidden them because she thought him unworthy?

Was her love for him just duty, while her heart truly belonged to Cassius?

"Every weekend, she visited me," Hamilton murmured, tracing the fan. "Sometimes we walked, sometimes she'd sit in my study all afternoon, reading or sketching. She never complained. And her art—flawless. A decade of practice, at least. When she draws, she’s radiant. Not some meek girl—a noblewoman through and through." He sighed. "Far better than that shallow Acacia. Pity you were too blind to see it."

Thaddeus clenched his jaw, unfolding the fan.

A single, elegant line of calligraphy caught his eye:

If I could return to my youth, I'd trade riches for a gentle breeze.

Lightning struck his chest. His hands trembled. The style—identical to the painting in Evadne's office.

He remembered seeing Isabella at Evadne's hotel. The footsteps in the hallway after he'd left Evadne's office. Did they know each other?

Could it be...?

No. Impossible.

Isabella was gentle, not cunning. She could never be as sharp as Evadne.

Meanwhile, in Skyrim, Silveke Harbor.

Cassius had just returned from Aetheria, dining with Arnold and their father.

Emeric listened to his son's report, pride flickering in his stern gaze. Cassius was brilliant—but he'd chosen the priesthood over power.

"You don’t usually play dirty, Cassius," Emeric remarked after a sip of wine. "Stealing Abernathy’s business—that’s more my style."

"Peace is like the human body," Cassius replied smoothly. "Healthy until it isn’t."

Arnold smirked. He knew this was revenge for Isabella.

"Business requires flexibility," Emeric said, clapping Cassius’ shoulder. "And Frederic is my enemy. His grandfather wronged our family. Revenge waits for no man."

Arnold sighed. The Ashbournes held grudges for generations.

"How’s Evadne handling Elmsworth?" Emeric asked casually, though concern laced his tone. "Her moves against Stirling were bold, but if she missteps, she’ll make enemies. Protect her."

"Of course," Arnold said.

"Dad, relax," Cassius added. "If anyone touches her, we’ll ruin them."

"Don’t kill them," Emeric corrected. "Just make them wish they were dead."

After dinner, Cassius left his phone behind. When it buzzed—Thaddeus’ name flashing—Arnold answered with false cheer.

"What can I do for you, Mr. Thaddeus?"

"I need to speak to Isabella." Thaddeus’ cold tone grated on him.

Arnold’s grin vanished. "Lost your mind? You don’t get to demand anything from her."

A pause. Then, heavily: "Cassius?"

Arnold steeled himself. "If you’re drunk, call your fiancée. I’m busy."

"If you want to defend her, do it openly," Thaddeus snapped. "Not with underhanded tricks."

Arnold’s laugh was sharp. "You’re the king of underhanded. Who smeared her name first? If you’re begging for Acacia, at least kneel properly. Disgusting."

Thaddeus’ fist clenched. The man who dominated boardrooms was speechless.

"Let me be clear," Arnold hissed. "Even if you grovel now, I won’t stop. Everyone who hurt her will pay."

He hung up.

Thaddeus sat in his study, veins bulging, his phone screen nearly cracking under his grip.

Gordon rushed in, pale. "Sir, I investigated—"

"Speak."

"Mrs. Ashbourne’s five children—only Cassius’ records are accessible. The other four? Highest-level encryption. Unbreakable."

Thaddeus’ gaze turned murderous.

Gordon swallowed. "Should I... resign now, or—?"

Evadne descended the stairs, fresh from her bath, a face mask on, robe swishing.

Jason hurried over. "Need something?"

"Just wine." She blinked at his formal attire. "It’s past nine. Relax. You’re off-duty here."

Another reason: he reminded her of Thaddeus.

Three years of marriage, and she’d only seen her husband’s body once—that unforgettable night. Thaddeus was disciplined, always in suits until bedtime. But beneath that icy exterior burned a fire she’d never forget.

"Evadne?" Jason tilted his head.

She snapped back, cheeks flushed.

"Your face... it’s red."
###Chapter 31

"Is that so?" Isabella pressed her fingertips to her burning cheek, the heat radiating like a miniature furnace. She quickly turned away, hiding her flustered expression.

"Must be the alcohol. I'm feeling a bit lightheaded already."

"You haven't even reached the wine cellar yet, and you're already blushing?" Nathaniel arched an eyebrow. The sharp-witted businessman who dominated boardrooms now resembled a clueless schoolboy, completely missing the signs of Isabella's infatuation.

"Stop prying." She shot him a playful glare before strutting away.

Nathaniel trailed behind like a chastised puppy, utterly bewildered by her sudden mood swing.

The wine cellar housed nearly a thousand bottles of premium reds - Alexander's personal collection curated specifically for Isabella's palate. Many were auction acquisitions even Reginald Vanderbilt couldn't obtain. The collection's value could purchase three penthouses in Manhattan's most exclusive neighborhood.

Her gaze landed on a coveted bottle of Romanée-Conti. Standing on tiptoes proved futile until Nathaniel's towering frame easily retrieved it. As he leaned in, the vanilla-scented shampoo in her hair triggered his pulse to spike, warmth creeping up his neck.

"Here you go, Ms. Sinclair."

"Having a tall assistant does have its perks. Saves me from climbing shelves."

Though secretly, she imagined someone taller - like Sebastian. The mere thought of that infuriating man made her temples throb.

"Let me open that for you. It must be difficult with one hand—"

CRACK. Isabella smashed her plaster cast against the table corner, revealing flawless skin beneath.

"Finally. That thing was driving me mad."

Nathaniel gaped.

"During my tour, I watched legs get vaporized by IEDs. Soldiers joking at breakfast returned by afternoon missing faces." Her detached tone carried the weight of battlefield horrors, eyes reflecting the calm of someone who'd stared down death. Nathaniel struggled reconciling this with the luxury-loving socialite before him.

The group chat exploded.

Oliver: "Sebastian, I get big bro's busy, but you? A Supreme Court justice slacking? Sebastian's hackers tried breaching our network. Good thing I encrypted everything. Him versus my firewalls? Maybe in another lifetime."

Isabella's almond eyes widened.

Sebastian: "He suspects us?! And since when do you address me so casually? It's 'elder brother' to you."

Oliver: "You exited Mom's womb three minutes earlier. Had I been first, you'd be calling me sir."

Sebastian: "Three minutes or three decades - seniority stands. Say it."

Oliver: "Sebastian."

Sebastian: "Need a reminder who pinned you in every childhood wrestling match?"

Oliver: "Try me now. I'll spot you both arms."

Isabella: "Enough! You're both embarrassing."

Instant silence.

Isabella swirled her merlot thoughtfully. "Sebastian's investigating us. Your interventions protecting me revealed you're not Alexander. He knows."

Her eyes glinted with calculated mischief.

"Time to stop hiding."

Let him have his answers - on her terms.

The press conference at The Regal Palace drew media vultures. Though Stirling Group ranked as a regional player, Victoria's engagement to Sebastian Abernathy catapulted them into the spotlight.

Across the street, Sebastian monitored the livestream from his Maybach, expression glacial.

"Your father's been insistent about supporting Stirling Group," Gordon ventured carefully. "Continuing to oppose him might..."

"Father-son relations require existing bonds to damage." Sebastian's voice could frost glass. "Elspeth's whispers change nothing."

Gordon sighed. The Abernathy heir's isolation was a wound no one acknowledged.

Onstage, Harrison Stirling's righteous indignation made Gordon sneer. "Their defective products hospitalized people last year, yet he's playing victim?"

Sebastian's jaw tightened as Harrison proclaimed Vintage Elegance's impeccable reputation.

A reporter pounced: "The K Group exposed your quality issues. They don't engage in smear campaigns. Care to explain the formaldehyde超标?"

Harrison's complexion darkened. "This isolated incident pains me deeply."

"Incident? Your two-year tenure saw three product recalls and embezzlement allegations. How's that isolated?"

Meanwhile, Isabella watched from her parked Ferrari, crimson lips curling. The reporter was her plant.

"Harrison's squandered the family fortune," Nathaniel scoffed. "Yet he stands there lying through his teeth."

"He's holding an ace." Isabella plucked a chocolate from his pocket, unwrapping it slowly. "Push him further, and he'll play it. That's our opening move."
###Chapter 32

Evadne popped the last bite of chocolate into her mouth, then with a playful grin, shoved the remaining half into Jason's front pocket. Her fingers lingered against his chest, tracing the firm outline of muscle beneath his shirt. "Mmm. Not bad at all."

Jason's pulse spiked. Heat rushed to his cheeks, and he ducked his head, suddenly self-conscious. At twenty-four, he was four years older than Evadne, but around her, he still felt like that awkward teenager who'd first met her in the sprawling gardens of Silveke Harbor.

Back then, he'd been trailing behind his father, the esteemed legal advisor to the Ashbourne family, when a flash of movement caught his eye. A girl in a flowing sundress glided toward him on a skateboard, sunlight catching in her hair like spun gold.

He'd blinked, certain he was imagining things—until she stopped right in front of him.

"Hey. Got any candy?" She hopped off the board, flipping it up into her hand with effortless grace.

Jason had stammered, caught off guard.

"No? Oh well." She sighed dramatically, already turning away—but he'd grabbed her wrist before he could think. Her arm was so slender, his fingers nearly circled it completely.

"Wait." He fumbled in his pocket and pulled out a chocolate bar. "Will this do?"

Her face lit up. "Perfect!" She snatched it, tore open the wrapper, and took a huge bite, eyes closing in bliss.

From that day on, Jason never visited the Ashbournes without pockets full of sweets. Even now, if Evadne wanted candy, he'd make sure she got it.

The press conference was a pressure cooker. Ives Stirling, sweating under the glare of cameras, jabbed a finger at the reporter who'd just challenged him. "For the last time—our products are flawless. I stake my reputation on it."

"And yet K Orld Hotel just recalled every Stirling mattress in their inventory." The journalist didn't back down. "If there's no issue, why the sudden move? The public deserves answers."

The live feed exploded with comments:

"His 'reputation'? That's worth less than a used tissue."

"Returning my Stirling sheets ASAP. Dude gives me slimy used-car-salesman vibes."

Ives' jaw tightened. Then, with a theatrical sigh, he straightened. "Fine. You want the truth? Here it is." His voice dropped, oozing false regret. "I admit—I failed to oversee every store in our nationwide chain. Some employees exploited that, cutting corners for personal profit. We terminated them immediately. But ask yourselves—why would K Group's Deputy GM Keith collaborate with them? Why is K Group pinning everything on us now?"

Gasps rippled through the room.

Gordon, watching from the sidelines, muttered, "Unbelievable. He's actually blaming the Ashbournes?"

Ives signaled his team. "Display Exhibit A."

The screen lit up with photos—Keith meeting covertly with Stirling's regional manager, bank transfers labeled "Kickback."

"Proof that Keith orchestrated this scam," Ives declared. "Stirling is the victim here. K Group threw us under the bus to cover their own corruption. We will sue for defamation!"

He was practically vibrating with triumph. That Ashbourne heiress probably thought she'd outmaneuvered him. Joke's on her—he'd been preparing this counterstrike for months. Keith was always meant to take the fall.

Online sentiment began shifting, critics accusing the Ashbournes of corporate bullying.

Then—

A screech of feedback blasted through the speakers.

Two voices filled the room:

"Ives, I swapped those mattresses for you! Now that Ashbourne witch found out, I'm ruined!"

"Relax. Between your cut and my bonus, you're set for life. Just keep your mouth shut—or you'll regret it."

Every head swiveled toward Ives. His face drained of color.

"Who played that? SHUT IT OFF!"

The audio cut—but the screen now showed security footage: Ives and Keith clinking champagne glasses at a nightclub, exchanging envelopes.

Smoking-gun evidence.

Reporters surged forward, shouting questions. Ives flailed, bellowing, "Deepfakes! This is a setup!"

Then—

BANG.

The doors flew open.

A squadron of federal agents marched in, badges glinting. At their head strode Arnold, his expression granite.

"Ives Stirling, you're under arrest for bribery, fraud, and conspiracy."

"No! You can't—"

Two agents seized him mid-protest, dragging him out as cameras flashed. The livestream went nuclear:

"HOLY PLOT TWIST."

"That prosecutor is FINE. Justice never looked so good."

Gordon whooped. "Now that's what I call timing!"

Beside him, Thaddeus didn't react. "Calculated," he said coolly.

"Huh?"

"The Ashbournes baited Ives into blaming Keith, then dropped the evidence bomb. That 'reporter' was probably theirs too."

Thaddeus' gaze locked onto Arnold's face on-screen. Recognition flared.

Him.

The man from the bar. The hospital. The one who looked so much like Cassius.

Thaddeus screenshot the feed and fed it into his facial-recognition software.

Ten minutes later, the result pinged:

Arnold Whitmore. Lead Prosecutor, Elmsworth District Attorney's Office.
###Chapter 33

The photograph surfaced unexpectedly on the official judiciary website—an archival image from three years prior. There stood Sebastian Sinclair, draped in his judicial robes, exuding an aura of unshakable authority within the courtroom.

Nathaniel's facial recognition software was revolutionary. With just one clear image, it could scour global databases and retrieve every traceable record within minutes—far surpassing conventional search engines.

Yet locating Sebastian took a full ten minutes. The man was a ghost—no social media presence, no public appearances. Odd for a prosecutor.

"Cassius... Sebastian..." Nathaniel's breath hitched as realization struck. His knuckles whitened against the steering wheel. "It can't be—"

"You're everywhere now, aren't you?" His voice turned venomous. "Throwing yourself at Cassius the moment you left me, then cozying up to that Ashbourne heir!"

The roar of an engine shattered his thoughts. Nathaniel's head snapped toward the sound.

A matte black Lamborghini streaked past like a shadow. Isabella's car. What was she doing here? This couldn't be coincidence.

Acid churned in Nathaniel's gut. His fist collided with the window.

"Follow that car!"

Reporters swarmed the hotel entrance like vultures. Investigators struggled to escort the disgraced Ives through the media frenzy—a spectacular downfall.

Sebastian avoided the chaos, waiting instead at the service entrance. Minutes later, the Lamborghini purred to a stop before him.

"Mr. Ashbourne." Jason lowered the window with polite deference.

"Jason." Sebastian's gaze softened as he leaned in to study Isabella. His fingers pinched her cheek affectionately. "Someone's been feeding you well. Your face has filled out."

"Liar!" Isabella swatted his hand away, pouting.

"Adorable when you're chubby." He laughed, dodging her playful swipe.

Nathaniel watched from the shadows, jaw clenched. Gordon fidgeted in the driver's seat—any fool could see why men flocked to a woman like Ms. Sinclair. Only his boss remained blind.

"Well?" Sebastian preened, adjusting his tie. "How do I look?"

"Like you've gained a fanclub." Isabella smirked, resting her chin on folded arms. "Half the internet's searching for the 'hot prosecutor' now."

Nathaniel's chest tightened. That carefree smile—she'd never once looked at him that way.

"Who cares about admirers?" Sebastian scoffed. "Your approval's all I need."

"Ugh, stick to courtroom drama. Romance isn't your genre." Her laughter sparkled in the evening air.

Their banter faded as business took precedence.

"We need your expertise moving forward." Isabella's expression sobered. "The Ashbourne Group deserves justice."

"Three years minimum." Sebastian's eyes hardened. "No parole. No leniency." Then, admiringly: "But this was your victory. Ives walked straight into your trap like a lamb to slaughter. If all criminals were this stupid—"

Indeed, Ives' idiocy was staggering. Yet the true coup was Keith's testimony—secured last night in a dingy bar where Isabella confronted the desperate man.

"You're bluffing!" Keith had slurred. "I won't be your pawn!"

"Then you'll die a fool," she'd countered coolly.

The deal was struck: if Ives betrayed Keith at the presser, Keith would expose everything. Isabella's leverage? Undisclosed evidence of their illicit dealings.

"Twenty years ago, my father lifted you from banquet halls to boardrooms." Her words had cut deep. "This is how you repay his faith?"

Guilt won. Keith surrendered the evidence.

Now, as Sebastian departed for the prosecutor's office, Jason's sharp eyes caught movement in the rearview. "We're being followed. Should I alert security?"

Isabella barely glanced at the trailing Maybach. Nathaniel's car. So he'd attended the press conference after all—how touching.

"Change of plans." Her lips curved. "Take us to Evergreen Meadows."

"But—"

"Drive."

The Lamborghini wove through traffic with serpentine grace, Nathaniel's driver struggling to keep pace. Through the windshield, Nathaniel caught glimpses of Isabella's hair whipping like dark silk—wild, untamed. The sunset painted her in gold, each glance a fresh wound.

At the overlook, Isabella leaned against the railing, the wind sculpting her dress against her silhouette. Nathaniel approached, his shadow stretching toward her like an accusation.

She turned, maintaining deliberate distance. "Stalking me now, Mr. Abernathy?"

"Isabella." Her name tasted like ash. His gaze flickered to her healed arm.

"Brought your birth certificate this time? Let's finalize that divorce. I'll have President Ashbourne expedite it." Her smile was razor-edged.

"Enjoying yourself?" Nathaniel stepped closer, voice dangerously low. "Playing the Ashbournes against my family?"

Her brow arched. "Excuse me?"

"Don't play innocent." His hand shot out, grasping her wrist. "You orchestrated this entire charade!"
###Chapter 34

Isabella's pupils dilated sharply, her chest constricting with tension.

Her fiery gaze locked onto Nathaniel. Those usually mesmerizing eyes now burned with such intensity it could make anyone's pulse race. The heat in her stare was so palpable that Nathaniel found himself unable to look away.

After a long moment, Isabella scoffed, her expression turning glacial as if they were complete strangers. "So, Mr. Prescott, you're here to defend your precious Victoria, is that it? You're absolutely fuming. Planning to take it out on me, or are you just here to throw a tantrum?"

"Nathaniel, you've gone too far." Her voice was steel wrapped in velvet. "Three years of devotion, and I never expected you to cherish the memories. But to degrade me with such vile words? Unacceptable. Besides, I'm not your wife anymore. No—let's be honest, you never truly made me your wife. I was just some stray you occasionally tossed scraps to, foolish enough to hope for more while you gave me nothing but cold indifference."

"Did you really think I'd endure your cruelty forever? Not a chance."

"Here's the unfortunate truth for you—even with all your power, you can't save Sterling Enterprises from collapse. With the evidence against Ives—corruption, fraud, defamation, and violating K Group's interests—it's a done deal. He's beyond saving."

Isabella's smile was razor-sharp. "Since you can't fix your mess, you resort to attacking my personal life, mocking and belittling me. But I don't play by your rules. I fight for what I deserve and discard what doesn't serve me without hesitation."

"I couldn't care less what anyone thinks of me—especially you. I want Sterling Enterprises to burn for what they've done, and I won't rest until it happens. No one can stop me."

Nathaniel's jaw clenched, veins standing out along his neck. With that man by her side, she stood taller, spoke bolder. He knew her words were unfair yet couldn't refute them.

What truly infuriated him wasn't her using the Ashbourne brothers to dismantle Sterling Enterprises. It was seeing her laugh with Adrian, that radiant smile—meant for someone else—that sent his mind spiraling.

"You're shameless," Nathaniel spat, the words scraping his throat.

Isabella laughed, the sound like shattering glass. "Even if I am, what's it to you? I answer to no one—least of all you." Done with this conversation, she turned to leave.

Without thinking, Nathaniel seized her recently healed arm, his grip bruising.

"Let go!" She hissed through gritted teeth, pain flashing across her face as she resisted jerking away, fearing she'd reopen the wound.

"Tell me, Isabella," Nathaniel's voice was rough, his gaze probing like a gambler desperate to see her cards, "what am I to you now?"

Her laugh was pure venom. "Nothing but a worthless ex-husband."

"Isabella!" His grip tightened.

"Nathaniel, release me—now!"

Suddenly, a broad-shouldered figure materialized between them, shoving Nathaniel back and shielding Isabella protectively.

"Daniel, it's fine—we were just talking," Isabella said calmly, though her fingers trembled slightly.

"Talking? He was manhandling your injured arm!" Daniel's glare at Nathaniel could've melted steel. "After the pain you endured last night because of him, he dares to—"

Nathaniel's stomach dropped. His fingers, which had just gripped her, curled into his palm.

Isabella shot Daniel a warning look, silently pleading for him to stop. This wasn't the time or place.

"You're Cas sius's secretary," Nathaniel realized coldly, his expression darkening.

"Yes, but now I'm her—" Daniel began, only for Isabella to yank his sleeve sharply.

"Cassi us lent me his most trusted aide. How generous." Nathaniel's smile didn't reach his eyes. "Congratulations on securing another wealthy match. First you fooled me, now it's Cassius's turn. Let's see how long you can keep up the act."

Each word was a dagger twisting in Isabella's chest. Daniel felt her tremble beside him but was more confused by Nathaniel's insinuations. What was he implying?

"Daniel, allow me to reintroduce you." Isabella inhaled deeply, masking her pain behind a polished smile. "This is Mr. Nathaniel Prescott of the Vanderbilt Group. My ex-husband."

Daniel's face drained of color. The missing three years—she'd been married to Nathaniel? Hidden from the world, from her own family? Why?

"But we're divorced now," Isabella continued smoothly. "I left with nothing, severing all ties to the Vanderbilt Group. Next time we meet, we'll be strangers."

"We're not legally divorced yet! Grandfather's birthday—"

"Enough!" Isabella exploded, eyes blazing crimson. "Stop using Grandfather as your excuse! Is that why you think you can humiliate me? Because you know I'd never hurt him?!"

Nathaniel flinched as if struck. In all their years together, Isabella had never raised her voice. She'd been soft as down, absorbing every slight without complaint. But now? Her fury was a living thing, her hatred palpable.

"Our marriage died long ago. You killed it when you betrayed me. You committed adultery, yet I never held you accountable. And now you expect me to mourn you forever? To never move on? How pathetically selfish!"

Selfish? The word lodged in Nathaniel's chest like shrapnel. He didn't recognize this version of himself—obsessed, irrational, consumed by a woman who'd supposedly meant nothing to him.

"I kept my word—our divorce would stay secret until Grandfather's birthday. But you? You let Victoria spill everything." Isabella's smile was bitter. "Now you're blaming me because I'm the only one you can blame. You'd never dare hold Victoria accountable, would you?"

Nathaniel stood frozen, watching helplessly as Daniel led his ex-wife away. His face burned as if she'd slapped him repeatedly.

His fist clenched empty air. He'd been the one to push her away first. So why did it feel like she'd discarded him? The bitterness in his throat was suffocating, his heart pierced by an agony he couldn't name—
###Chapter 35

Isabella Sinclair had no desire to return to the hotel. Home was where she wanted to be.

The silence stretched between them until Jason Prescott couldn’t take it anymore. "Ms. Isabella," he ventured carefully, "does Alexander Kingsley know you're the Ashbourne heiress?"

"Yes," she answered softly, her expression unreadable.

Jason's eyes widened in realization. That explained why she'd sent a stand-in to meet Alexander the first time he came. It all clicked into place.

"Jason, I didn’t mean to keep it from you—"

"I get it."

She blinked at him, surprised.

"Who wants to relive heartbreak? Some things are better buried." His grip tightened on the steering wheel, knuckles whitening. "I just worry about you. If Chairman Emeric ever found out how that bastard treated you..." His voice cracked.

This was the princess their family adored, reduced to tears by Alexander Kingsley. If Emeric knew, there’d be hell to pay.

"The longer it stays hidden, the better. One failed marriage was enough. I’m done with love."

Isabella closed her eyes. Alexander’s cruel words echoed in her mind. She let out a dry laugh. "Pathetic, isn’t it?"

"If you’re not marrying, then neither am I," Jason declared.

She shot him a look. "Don’t be ridiculous. You’re my secretary, not a monk. I won’t have people thinking I run a convent."

Jason chuckled weakly, but his heart ached. He knew his place. Still, he’d protect her in silence. "Ms. Isabella… why did you marry him?"

Her lashes lowered, shielding the storm in her eyes.

I shouldn’t have asked.

"When I was eleven," she began, voice steady, "my school organized a mountain hike. I lost my mother’s sapphire pendant up there."

She ignored the warnings, searching alone. The storm hit fast. Trapped, freezing, she nearly died.

"Alexander was a park ranger then. He fought through the hurricane to find me."

She remembered waking to his face—drenched, beautiful, like starlight given form.

"Thank God you're alive! Don’t be scared, I’ve got you."

That moment sealed her fate.

"He carried me down, cracking terrible jokes to keep me awake." A faint smile touched her lips.

"Little girl, what’s your name?"

"Not telling? Fine, I’ll call you Tiny. You’re all small—hands, nose, stubbornness."

"I’m not small! I’ll grow!"

"Tell me, but no one else. Bad boys might take advantage."

Her breath hitched. Seventeen-year-old Alexander hadn’t been as broad as he was now, but he’d shielded her with his life when they nearly fell off a cliff.

Then he vanished.

Three years later, she spotted him on TV with the Kingsleys. That began her pilgrimage toward his light. When he enlisted, she joined Doctors Without Borders—just to stand where he might pass.

Now, thirteen years of devotion had curdled to dust.

Jason listened, stunned.

"But I can’t hate him." She stretched her hand out the window, catching nothing but wind. "Everything I did was my choice. No regrets. Our story’s square."

Alexander Kingsley drove home in a daze. His skull buzzed like a hive. Evadne’s shattered gaze haunted him.

Why did his chest feel hollow?

Alva intercepted him at the study. "Sir, Ms. Victoria’s here."

"Not interested."

She gaped. Since when did he brush Victoria off?

"If she’s here about Ives, save it. The Sterlings are a mess—she should be with her family."

"And if she refuses to leave?"

"Let her rot." He massaged his temples.

Good-for-nothing ex-husband. The insult burned. Since when was he useless?

Alva smirked, delighted, and scurried off.

Alexander frowned. She loathed Victoria.

Outside, Alva folded her arms as Victoria paced.

"Alexander’s done with you. Go home."

"I need to see him!"

Victoria tried shoving past. Alva barely flexed her arm, sending the heiress sprawling.

"You—how dare you! I’ll be Mrs. Kingsley! You’re fired!"

"Try getting the ring first." Alva sniffed. "Only one woman’s ever been worthy of that title, and it’s not you."

Victoria’s face purpled.

"Sue me. Retirement sounds nice anyway."

Alva prayed Alexander would see through this act. Where was the delicate flower now?

"Alexander! Help me!" Victoria wailed like a convict begging for clemency.

No response.

"Keep screaming. The family’s out."

"I’ll wait all night!"

Alva eyed the gathering clouds. "Rain’s coming. Have fun." She marched inside, ordering the staff to bar the gates.

Hours later, drenched and shaking, Victoria knelt in the downpour. "Alexander… please…"

"Only an idiot falls for that," Alva muttered.

Footsteps sounded behind her. Alexander strode past, jaw set, heading for the storm.
###Chapter 36

Isabella's eyes widened in disbelief. This couldn't be happening! How could Alexander Kingsley, of all people, fall for this pathetic act?

Was he really that blind?

Before she could react, Alexander grabbed an umbrella and strode toward the door without a word.

"Mr. Kingsley!" Isabella called out, frustration bubbling in her chest. But he didn’t even glance back. She clenched her fists, resisting the urge to shake some sense into him.

Outside, Victoria Sterling lay crumpled in the rain, her strength nearly gone. The moment she spotted Alexander approaching, however, her energy surged back. She sniffled dramatically, her tears blending with the raindrops.

Alexander’s jaw tightened. He moved swiftly, shielding her with the umbrella while hauling her up with his free hand. His grip was firm, leaving no room for resistance.

"Alex," Victoria whimpered, collapsing into his arms. Seconds ago, she had been half-dead from exhaustion. Now, she clung to him like a lifeline, her damp face pressing against his chest.

Alexander exhaled sharply, irritation flickering in his gaze. "You know your health is fragile. Standing out here in the rain is reckless."

"Would you have come to see me otherwise?" Victoria’s voice trembled. "I just wanted to talk to you… Why are you avoiding me?"

Her tears fell harder, desperation flashing in her eyes. "Alex… do you not love me anymore? You’ve been so distant lately. Is this because of the incident with Evelyn? I know I was wrong. I’ll apologize to her—I’ll beg if I have to!"

"Don’t bother. I’m not angry anymore." His tone was icy. "You’ve seen me now. Go home. Once things settle, I’ll visit."

"Alex, please!" Victoria’s composure shattered. Her grip on him tightened as she slid slightly down his body. "My brother is about to be sentenced! Every lawyer in New York is terrified of the Vanderbilt Group’s influence. No one will take his case, no matter how much we offer! The Vanderbilts are ruthless—they won’t stop until we’re ruined! Please… if my brother goes to prison, my family is finished!"

Alexander’s expression remained unreadable. If he was heartless, his devotion to Victoria had been unwavering—a childhood promise kept for over two decades. He had hurt Evelyn, defied his family, all for her.

Yet if he was soft, he was also just. When the Sterlings broke the law, he hadn’t shielded them. His resolve was unshakable.

Now, he remembered the cruel words he’d thrown at Evelyn, mocking her family’s downfall. Regret twisted inside him, hardening his voice further. "Evelyn did nothing wrong. Your brother brought this on himself. I advised him to surrender—it would’ve lessened his sentence. As for the Sterling Group, it needs restructuring. No amount of money will save it if the leadership remains incompetent."

Victoria’s lips quivered. She had expected tears and pleas to sway him, as they always had. But this time, she was wrong. Alexander’s patience had limits. Cross them, and even she wasn’t exempt.

In the end, he pushed her into the car himself, ordering the driver to lock the doors. Only when the vehicle disappeared did his shoulders relax slightly.

He stood in the rain for a long time, Evelyn’s disappointed eyes haunting him. The ache in his chest was inescapable.

Back at the Sterling mansion, silence hung heavy.

Victoria’s parents took one look at her mud-streaked, ghostly appearance and didn’t ask about her state—only whether Alexander would help. Their desperation was palpable.

"Useless!" Mr. Sterling snarled, jabbing a finger at her. "All these years with Alexander, and what have you gained? Not a single asset, not even a foot in the Kingsley mansion! He doesn’t love you. You’re worthless!"

Victoria’s eyes burned. Her father had always despised her. She had clawed her way up, learning to manipulate, to play the game—all to prove herself.

Alexander had been her first target at eight. She hadn’t even liked him back then, but her aunt had urged her to practice on him.

Now, after everything, her father still saw her as a tool.

She wanted to scream. She didn’t care if her brother rotted in jail. If the Sterling Group collapsed, so be it.

"Enough!" Una Sterling snapped, pulling Victoria close. "If Alexander won’t help, what can she do? This is your fault! If you hadn’t spoiled that worthless son of yours—"

Mr. Sterling’s face darkened, but he held his tongue. His wife’s sister was married to a Vanderbilt. He couldn’t risk offending them.

"The priority now is damage control," Una hissed. "We need to secure Victoria’s marriage to Alexander. If necessary, we’ll force it. Once she’s his wife, the Kingsleys can’t abandon us!"

Victoria’s hand flew to her stomach. "Mother, you’re forgetting—"

Una’s gaze dropped to the faint stretch marks. Annoyance flickered. "If they’re still visible by the wedding, cover them with a tattoo."

Victoria recoiled. A tattoo? On her flawless skin?

Servants carried jewelry boxes downstairs.

"Madam, everything’s ready."

"Those are mine!" Victoria lunged for the most valuable one—a ruby pendant Alexander had commissioned from a famed Parisian designer.

"We’re selling them," Una said coldly.

"What? No!"

"The company needs funds. This jewelry, combined with mine, will buy us time. There’s a charity auction soon—we must attend to salvage our reputation. And Alexander’s grandfather’s birthday is coming. A gift from the auction might sway him."

Una’s voice softened slightly. "Once you’re Mrs. Kingsley, you’ll have more wealth than you can imagine. Think long-term."

Victoria hesitated—then handed over the box, her heart breaking.
###Chapter 37

The Sterling Group was drowning in a crisis of both reputation and finance.

Customers were abandoning Sterling products en masse. What had once been Ives' crowning achievement—a retail empire boasting over 500 stores nationwide—had collapsed to barely a hundred in just seven days. The remaining stores were barely clinging to survival, slashing prices to unload inventory, even at a loss.

As the financial hemorrhage worsened, the already fragile Mr. Sterling collapsed under the strain. In desperation, Una turned to her sister for help. But Elspeth, still reeling from past consequences, could only watch helplessly from the sidelines.

"Hamilton has made it clear—anyone who aids the Sterling Group will face his wrath. I'm living under someone else's roof now, sister. You can't imagine the struggle," Elspeth sighed, squeezing Una's hand in sympathy. "Though the Abernathys can't intervene, I've urged Frederic to finalize Acacia and Thaddeus' wedding date. Perhaps the weekend after Mr. Hamilton's birthday?"

"His 80th birthday?" Una's voice cracked with panic. She could wait—but the Sterling Group couldn't!

"I'd marry them off tomorrow if I could. But Mr. Hamilton insists on waiting. There's nothing I can do."

Elspeth leaned closer, lowering her voice. "Rumor has it that after leaving Thaddeus, Ms. na became involved with the president of The K Group. She was whisked away by President Ashbourne the very day she left the Abernathy estate. Half the household witnessed it."

Una had heard whispers from her son, and jealousy burned through her. Why couldn't her daughter be as cunning? Acacia still hadn't secured Thaddeus' devotion, while his ex-wife had already landed another wealthy suitor.

"Do you think The K Group's assault on the Sterling Group was influenced by something na said to President Ashbourne?" Elspeth mused, stirring her tea with feigned innocence.

Una's eyes flashed with realization. She shot up from the sofa, fury igniting in her gaze.

"That witch! First, she sabotages Acacia's wedding, and now she's destroying our business—even after divorcing Thaddeus! Does she think she's untouchable now that she's latched onto a richer man?"

"Touching her is difficult," Elspeth sighed. "Ms. na is now President Ashbourne's lover. The Ashbournes operate on a level beyond our reach."

"Worthy of the Ashbournes? That common gold-digger?"

Una's jealousy twisted into something darker. Then, an idea struck. "na plays the devoted ex-wife for Mr. Hamilton, pretending she still loves Thaddeus. But she's already moved on—publicly. If we exposed her deceit at his birthday celebration..."

Elspeth sipped her tea, a knowing smile curling her lips. "A brilliant thought. But remember—you conceived it. I said nothing."

In the manager's office of The K World Hotel.

The screen blazed crimson, screams echoing from the speakers.

Evadne, sharp-eyed and quick-fingered, had already reviewed the documents and now indulged in her favorite pastime: obliterating novice players in her favorite game. As another character fell to her blade, blood splattering dramatically, Jason entered—then immediately recoiled, shielding his eyes.

"Speak or leave," Evadne commanded, her fingers flying across the keyboard.

"Two updates, ma'am." Jason covered the screen with one hand and slid a file toward her with the other before retreating hastily.

"You're pathetic," she laughed, executing another kill. "How will you protect your girlfriend with nerves like that? Next time, I'm dragging you to a horror escape room!"

Jason forced a weak smile.

When the game ended—no survivors—Evadne tossed aside the controller and picked up the file. "Ashbourne Pawnshop records? Why bring these to me?"

"Acacia's mother pawned these jewels at our shop," Jason smirked. "Just as you predicted—with the Abernathys refusing aid, the Sterlings are scrambling for cash."

"I expected them to sell property. Pawning jewelry? They must still have some reserves."

"Burning through their last coins to keep the company afloat," Jason sneered. "Serves them right for crossing us."

Evadne flipped through the records idly—then froze.

Her fingers trembled slightly as she stared at Ruby Enigma listed among the items. Mockery and bitterness twisted inside her.

This was the pendant Thaddeus had gifted Acacia—the one Evadne had coveted two years ago when she saw him admiring it under the light. She'd dreamed of receiving anything from him, even a pebble.

But dreams were just that.

Thaddeus only gave gifts to those he loved. And he hadn't loved her.

Now, Acacia had sold his "priceless" affection for a mere $700,000. Evadne's lips curled in amusement, but her eyes held something darker.

"I wonder how Thaddeus would feel about this."

"What was that?" Jason asked.

"The Sterlings have no appreciation for value. This pendant is worth millions—and they pawned it for pennies? We robbed them blind."

Her phone rang. Cas sius.

"Brother!" Her playful tone vanished, replaced with sweetness.

"Evadne, how are you? Not overworking?" His voice was warm.

"I'm fine. You're the one who needs rest."

After pleasantries, he cut to the chase. "There's a charity auction this weekend. I'm scheduled to bid on a Dante Chair—budget, $10 million. But I'm lecturing at the church. Could you attend in my place?"

"Me? What's my role? K Group President's dazzling girlfriend?" She popped chocolate into her mouth.

"However you like. Perhaps the Ashbourne family's mysterious heiress?"

She chewed thoughtfully.

Cas sius chuckled. "You've avoided the spotlight long enough. Elmsworth's elite won't recognize you."

"Fine. But $10 million is chump change. What if I spot something else?"

"Buy it. Our family rule: if we attend an auction, we dominate it."

"Ah, the Ashbourne motto: Leave no treasure for the unworthy," she laughed, flicking her fingers.

"Good luck. Don't forget the Dante Chair."

After hanging up, Jason frowned. "Miss Evadne, if we're representing Mr. Cas sius, we should bring a donation. But preparing something now—"

"It's already handled."

Evadne's smile turned sly, eyes glinting with mischief.

Weekend. Parkray Auction. Elmsworth.
###Chapter 38

The auction house entrance swarmed with journalists, their access blocked to safeguard the elite attendees' privacy. Cameras flashed relentlessly as reporters jostled for position, forced to remain outside like spectators at an exclusive gala.

Inside, the atmosphere crackled with quiet intensity. True connoisseurs and financial titans moved through the space with calculated grace, their interest solely fixed on the treasures up for bid. Media attention meant nothing to these individuals—their currency was profit, not publicity.

Except for three women.

Every year without fail, Elspeth transformed this charity auction into her personal runway show. She'd linger at the entrance, striking poses for the paparazzi until staff practically dragged her inside. It was as if she feared the world might forget she'd once been famous for wrecking a marriage twenty years prior. Frederic hadn't graced the event in two years, likely considering it beneath his stature.

This year, however, Elspeth yielded the spotlight—not out of generosity, but because Una had begged her sister the night before to let her and Acacia shine. Family ties, however strained, demanded some concessions.

So today, the media circus belonged to Acacia and her mother.

"The Stirling Group is honored to participate in tonight's auction," Una announced to the reporters with practiced poise, every inch the society matriarch. "We look forward to acquiring exceptional pieces while supporting worthy causes."

A journalist shoved a microphone forward. "Mrs. Stirling, rumors suggest your company is nearing bankruptcy. Any comment?"

Another voice cut in. "Has Ives been cleared of those fraud allegations? Will he face prison time?"

Then came the question that made Acacia's blood boil. "We've heard there's romantic trouble between your daughter and the Abernathy Group president. Care to address that?"

"Romantic trouble?" Acacia lunged forward, eyes blazing. "What nonsense are you spreading?"

The reporter remained unfazed. "Ms. Acacia, it's a reasonable question. With your family's financial troubles, one might expect your fiancé Thaddeus to intervene. His silence speaks volumes, don't you think?"

"I haven't broken up with Thad!" Acacia's voice cracked, the strain of Thaddeus's recent distance evident in her shrill tone. "Stop fabricating lies!"

Una swiftly pulled her daughter back, pasting on a serene smile. "My daughter and Mr. Thaddeus's relationship remains strong. As for business matters between our companies, those are confidential."

"Then why didn't Mr. Thaddeus arrive with Ms. Acacia tonight?" a reporter pressed.

"Multiple witnesses saw him enter alone thirty minutes ago," another added.

The color drained from both women's faces.

Meanwhile, Thaddeus moved through the auction hall with Gordon at his side.

"Thad!" Jareth materialized from the crowd, his mischievous grin at odds with the formal setting. He wrapped an arm around Thaddeus's waist with casual intimacy. "Your gym sessions are paying off. Impressive physique."

Thaddeus stiffened. "Behave."

Jareth chuckled, undeterred. "Remember when we were kids and you'd—"

"Don't." Thaddeus cut him off with a warning glare.

"Fine, fine." Jareth switched tactics, nodding toward the entrance. "Your future in-laws just arrived. No greeting?"

"Best avoided."

"Smart man." Jareth's expression turned serious. "The Stirling Group's reputation is toxic. Anyone associated with them ends up tainted."

Thaddeus's jaw tightened. "Watch your words."

"I'm looking out for you. Grandfather only allowed them entry because of you. Frankly, they're out of their depth here."

"Acacia will be my wife. You'll treat her with respect."

Jareth sighed dramatically. "If you insist. But between us? That ex of yours—the fiery one—was better suited to you. A man like you needs a woman who can match your intensity."

Gordon coughed into his fist to disguise a laugh.

Thaddeus's expression darkened. "That chapter is closed. Rekindling old flames is beneath me."

"Whatever you say." Jareth changed subjects smoothly. "See anything you're bidding on tonight?"

"The Dante Chair." A birthday gift for his grandfather.

"Excellent choice. I'll make sure no one outbids you."

Thaddeus shook his head. "Let the auction proceed naturally. Forcing outcomes defeats the purpose."

As they took their seats in the front row—reserved for society's uppermost echelon—whispers followed in their wake.

"Thaddeus Abernathy is divine. That man could ruin me and I'd thank him."

"Save your fantasies. He's practically married to that Stirling girl."

"That tacky home decor family? Please. They're not fit to lick his boots."

"Rumor has it he divorced his first wife for Acacia. What does that tell you?"

"Poor ex-wife. That Stirling girl won't last—she's all flash, no substance."

Thaddeus sat with regal indifference, his imposing presence creating an invisible barrier. Then his gaze snagged on a nameplate across the aisle: Cassius. His jaw clenched.

"Don't blame me," Jareth murmured. "Grandfather handles seating arrangements. Even your stepmother got relegated to the back. Cassius is Emeric's heir—we can't slight him."

Out in the lobby, the Frost sisters held court with other socialites. Glynnis and Acacia exchanged saccharine compliments while Mari remained conspicuously absent.

"Where's your sister?" Acacia asked innocently.

"Who cares?" Glynnis sneered. "That timid mouse embarrasses the family."

Acacia hid a smirk behind a sympathetic pout. Driving wedges between sisters was child's play—and necessary insurance for her future position in the Abernathy household.

The atmosphere shifted abruptly as commanding footsteps echoed through the space. Heads turned as Evadne entered, her tailored black suit and sky-high heels making the other women's elaborate gowns seem garish by comparison. Jason followed, looking equally polished.

Elspeth's greeting dripped with false warmth. "How surprising to see you here, Evadne. How... democratic of the organizers."

Evadne paused, one hand in her pocket, and smiled. "The world contains many surprises for those with narrow perspectives."
###Chapter 39

The entire room fell into stunned silence at her words. All eyes locked onto Isabella Sinclair.

None of the aristocratic ladies had guessed the breathtaking woman before them was Alexander Kingsley's former wife. They'd assumed she must be some foreign princess. How else could her family afford such extravagance to openly challenge Margaret Vanderbilt?

Isabella trembled with fury, her lips curling into a sneer. "Ms. Sinclair, how you've changed with your newfound status. I never realized you could be so... articulate."

Evadne merely arched a perfect eyebrow, completely unshaken by the venomous remark. "I simply mirror how people address me. What does status have to do with it?"

Isabella's face flushed crimson, her composure crumbling.

"Evadne! How dare you speak to my mother like that!" Glynnis sprang forward, fists clenched, ready to defend her mother's honor.

Evadne's laugh was cold as winter.

Glynnis shared her mother's cunning but lacked her ruthlessness. Engaging with such transparent schemers wasn't worth her time.

"Does anyone here require glasses?"

Nathaniel stepped forward, his expression glacial. "The instigator was quite obvious to anyone with functioning vision."

"How... popular Ms. Sinclair is," Acacia sneered from the sidelines. "First protected by President Ashbourne, now this gentleman. Quite the collection of champions."

"Acacia," Evadne's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper, "gossip requires only a mouth. But have you considered the consequences?"

Acacia's pulse spiked.

She'd dismissed this woman as some naive country girl easily intimidated.

Now, facing those piercing eyes, fear coiled in her stomach. The more she interacted with Evadne, the more unpredictable she became.

"Ms. Sinclair, we're merely concerned for your reputation." Una's tone dripped with false concern. "After all, you did... interfere with Acacia and Alexander's relationship. Though we don't blame you - it was clearly unintentional. But now that Acacia and Alexander are engaged, your presence as his ex-wife is rather... inappropriate."

Acacia smirked triumphantly at her mother's expertly delivered barb.

The noblewomen gasped, their gazes turning judgmental.

So this was the infamous ex-wife - and a homewrecker too!

How disgraceful!

"I interfered?" Evadne's laugh rang out sharp and clear. "Mrs. Vanderbilt, has your mind become as shoddy as your company's furniture?"

Una's face purpled with rage.

"When I married Mr. Kingsley, he was single. Your daughter ended things because she couldn't handle the pressure. How is that my fault?" Evadne's smile turned lethal. "Shall I list every time your daughter harassed my husband during our three-year marriage? Would that satisfy your... curiosity?"

Acacia paled.

During those years abroad, she'd sent countless vicious texts, even called to hurl abuse. Evadne had never retaliated... until now.

"Nathaniel, show them."

With a nod, Nathaniel produced a folder from his briefcase. The marriage certificate inside struck like a physical blow.

"As you can see, Mr. Kingsley and I haven't finalized our divorce." Evadne's smile could have frozen hell. "Yet some can't wait to steal what's still mine."

Acacia's face burned hotter than molten lava.

Who carried their marriage certificate around?

But Evadne always prepared for every contingency. This document was her mirror, reflecting their lies back at them.

Isabella and Una found themselves speechless. Legally, Evadne still held the upper hand. Any further argument would only deepen their humiliation.

"Now, who's the unwanted third wheel here? I'll let you decide."

With that, Evadne departed amidst shocked whispers, leaving Acacia trembling with impotent rage.

As the auction's commencement neared, VIPs filled their assigned seats. Isabella and Glynnis sat in the third row, the younger woman's gaze darting constantly toward Jareth.

"He's breathtaking," Glynnis sighed.

"This Jareth Foundation gala is impossibly exclusive," Isabella muttered. "I couldn't even secure front row seats."

"Mother, Alexander and Jareth are close. Couldn't you ask Alexander to introduce me?" Glynnis pleaded.

Isabella's expression darkened at the mention of her stepson. "Absolutely not."

"Where's Mari?"

"Probably making a spectacle somewhere." Glynnis wrinkled her nose. "Must you bring her? She's an embarrassment to the Sinclair name!"

"Your sister needs to socialize. At twenty, she should be married off already - one less problem to manage." Isabella sighed as if discussing expired goods.

Meanwhile, Acacia and Una fumed from their seats at the very back of the venue.

"Mother! Alexander's in the front! I want to sit with him!" Acacia made to storm forward but was blocked by security.

"Seating is assigned, Ms. Vanderbilt. No exceptions."

"Do you know who I am?" Acacia hissed.

"Mr. Kingsley's girlfriend," the guard said flatly. "But these arrangements were made by the Jareth Group chairman himself. Not even his wife could change them."

Una yanked her daughter back. "Enough! It's just a seat!"

Her eyes burned with resentment watching Isabella and Glynnis chatting comfortably in better seats. Her sister had always pretended to help while actually undermining her.

The hall was packed, with only one empty seat remaining in the front row - reserved for Cas sius.

Alexander's gaze flickered toward it before he looked away.

"Strange," Jareth mused. "President Ashbourne hasn't arrived. Could he be skipping?"

At that moment, the grand doors swung open.

Every head turned. Even Alexander, normally indifferent, found himself glancing back.

His breath caught.

His ex-wife strode in, clad in a razor-sharp black suit and stilettos, commanding the room like a queen claiming her throne.
###Chapter 40

Isabella didn’t opt for a lavish gown. Instead, she stunned in a sleek pantsuit of her own design, accentuated by a rare yellow diamond brooch crafted by renowned jeweler Henri Delacroix.

Her entrance was nothing short of regal. Amidst the sea of aristocratic debutantes draped in finery, her understated yet striking elegance commanded attention.

They were the princesses society adored.

But Isabella? She was born to rule.

Victoria, witnessing her rival steal the spotlight, seethed with quiet fury.

To her irritation, whispers erupted around her as guests openly admired Isabella.

“Good heavens, who is she? That aura is magnetic!”

“If she weren’t so young, I’d swear she was a Fortune 500 CEO. She outshines every man here!”

“That brooch—isn’t that Henri’s legendary ‘Twilight’? Someone offered ten million for it years ago, and he refused without hesitation!”

Twilight?

Anyone with even a passing interest in jewelry knew Henri Delacroix and his infamous masterpiece.

Victoria’s nails dug into her palms. She hadn’t noticed the brooch earlier, but now, envy burned through her like acid.

“Seems the country mouse has charmed her way into Alexander Kingsley’s favor,” Una muttered, shooting her daughter a scathing look. “After all my training, you still can’t outmaneuver some provincial nobody? Without my scheming to push you toward Thaddeus, do you think he’d spare you a second glance?”

“Mother!” Victoria’s voice trembled with indignation. “I’ve already won him over! Why must you undermine me?” Her eyes glistened with unshed tears. “So what if Isabella has Cassius? The Abernathys are no match for us! She’s just a discarded ex-wife—Thaddeus would never return to her. He’s mine!”

“Until those divorce papers are signed, stay vigilant,” Una hissed. “Thaddeus has been distant lately. Even Hamilton hesitates to accept you. If you think this battle is won just because she left the Abernathy estate, you’re a fool.”

Victoria knew Thaddeus’s ardor had cooled. But how could she reignite his passion when he’d been avoiding her?

Isabella glided past the Stirling family, leaving a whisper of delicate perfume in her wake.

“Mother, where is that peasant sitting?” Glynnis whispered, anxiety lacing her voice.

Elspeth’s smile froze. She’d hoped Isabella would be relegated to some obscure corner—not the coveted front row!

Thaddeus’s pulse quickened as Isabella approached, but she didn’t spare him a glance, settling gracefully into Cassius’s reserved seat.

“Cassius sent Isabella as his proxy? Since when?” Jareth gaped, equal parts shocked and intrigued.

Thaddeus exhaled sharply, his gaze locked on the woman mere meters away.

Isabella’s smile was radiant, yet her demeanor was ice—an unspoken warning to keep their distance.

She acted as though Thaddeus were invisible.

“Holy hell—that’s the Twilight brooch!” Jareth blurted. “Three years ago, I begged Henri for it, offered ten mil, called in every favor I had—nothing. And now it’s on Isabella’s lapel? Cassius must be head over heels. Respect.”

Thaddeus stiffened.

No one understood sacrificing for love better than he did.

He’d once flown to Paris for two weeks, enduring countless rejections, just to secure the Ruby Enigma for Victoria’s birthday.

Yet in three years of marriage, he’d never gifted Isabella anything.

Now Cassius showered her with treasures, each more dazzling than the last.

The realization settled like a lead weight in his chest.

He hated how it made him feel—inadequate.

As the auction commenced, Jareth took the stage with polished charm, delivering the opening address.

Glynnis watched, starry-eyed, already mentally naming their future children.

The applause was thunderous. Before stepping down, Jareth flashed Isabella a roguish grin and a suggestive wink.

Her response? A glacial stare followed by an unapologetic eye roll.

Thaddeus’s jaw clenched.

“So, how’d I do?” Jareth nudged him, grinning.

“Do it again,” Thaddeus said flatly. “And I’ll break your nose.”

Jareth sighed. “You’re more high-maintenance than all my exes combined.”

The first item—a Renaissance oil painting—was unveiled. Though exquisite, it was a replica, the original housed in Thaddeus’s grandfather’s collection.

Bids climbed steadily.

Then Isabella’s voice cut through the murmur.

“Five hundred thousand.”

Thaddeus frowned. She knew this was a copy. Why overpay?

“Six hundred thousand!” Victoria shouted, paddle raised high.

Isabella didn’t flinch. “Seven.”

“Eight!” Victoria’s voice rang with defiance.

Una paled. This wasn’t part of their budget.

“Nine hundred thousand,” Isabella countered coolly.

Una’s grip on her daughter’s arm tightened. “Victoria, stop. This is reckless!”

“One million!” Victoria’s eyes blazed with triumph.

The crowd gasped.

Jareth chuckled. “First item, and already at a mil? Should I thank your ex or your fiancée for this windfall?”

Thaddeus said nothing, his knuckles white.

Isabella’s lips curved. She lowered her paddle.

“Sold! Congratulations to Ms. Victoria Stirling!”

Victoria beamed, victorious.

Una looked ready to faint.

Outside, Jason watched the scene unfold via livestream, grinning.

Isabella had played Victoria perfectly—luring her into squandering a fortune on a fake.

The woman was a mastermind.
###Chapter 41

Thaddeus's expression darkened, his lips pressed into a tight line.

The bidding had already reached nine hundred thousand, so a million was nothing.

Evadne suddenly stopped. Not because she couldn't afford it—she could. She just chose to let it go. On purpose.

But he couldn't say a word. No one had forced her to spend a fortune on that painting. It was her own decision.

For the rest of the auction, Evadne remained composed, not making another bid.

Thaddeus only had eyes for the Dante Chair, so he stayed silent too.

Next up was a Victorian antique table lamp, donated by Elspeth on behalf of the Abernathy Group. Starting bid: two hundred thousand.

Evadne scoffed, shaking her head in disdain.

She’d rather buy a cheap knockoff than waste money on that junk. Whoever bought it was a fool.

As expected, the bidding was weak. Despite the auctioneer’s efforts, it sold for just two hundred and sixty thousand.

Elspeth’s smile faded.

At least it hadn’t gone below two hundred and fifty.

Thaddeus, however, remained indifferent.

Whatever Elspeth did, the embarrassment fell on Frederic. Though they were father and son, spouses were a united front.

"Next, we have a 17th-century European royal silver conch cup, donated by Suri Bright Ashbourne from the K Group!"

The collectors perked up instantly.

Evadne stiffened, quickly turning around.

There, in the back rows, sat Suri’s elegant figure.

[Suri’s here? Why didn’t you warn me?]

She texted Jason in a panic.

Jason replied. [Just found out! Probably Chairman Emeric sent her last minute.]

Evadne’s stomach twisted.

Nearly the entire Abernathy family was here tonight. One wrong move, and her identity could be exposed.

Then she caught Suri flashing her an "okay" sign—a silent promise only best friends understood.

Warmth flooded Evadne’s chest. She got it now.

Suri was brilliant.

The room buzzed with excitement over the K Group’s item.

People praised the Ashbourne Group’s generosity, a true display of corporate prestige.

In comparison, the Abernathy Group’s contributions were lackluster. Their donations looked like cheap decor.

Whispers about Elspeth’s poor taste spread.

Elspeth squirmed, humiliation burning her cheeks.

Her collection paled next to Suri’s. The difference was embarrassing.

For the first time tonight, interest flickered in Thaddeus’s eyes as he toyed with his bidding paddle.

"This is exquisite."

"The color of the sky after rain," Evadne murmured.

Thaddeus glanced at her, surprised.

She was lost in the antique’s beauty, her delicate skin glowing under the lights, breathtakingly radiant.

Though Evadne was stunning, he’d never paid much attention—his heart belonged to another.

Sometimes, he even pitied her for wasting her beauty chasing after him.

His gaze drifted to her wrist.

She still wore his grandfather’s bracelet. Even mismatched with her outfit, she refused to take it off.

His pulse hitched.

The silver conch cup sparked a fierce bidding war.

"One million!"

"Two and a half!"

"Two point seven!"

"Four million."

Thaddeus raised his paddle, his voice cool.

The room gasped.

Evadne stiffened, eyes snapping to him.

So the man with no taste in women had impeccable taste in antiques.

He met her gaze.

Her sharp, analytical stare pierced him, sending an unexpected jolt through his chest.

She looked away just as quickly.

Thaddeus won the cup, drawing admiring murmurs.

"Next time I visit, serve me in this," Jareth teased. "It suits my status."

"Too small for you," Thaddeus deadpanned. "I have something better."

"Oh?"

"A toilet."

Jareth groaned. "You’re heartless."

Evadne burst out laughing.

Acacia fumed. Wasting millions on a stupid cup? Why not buy a house instead?

She wasn’t even married to him yet, and she was already stressing over the Abernathy finances.

"Next, we have a truly special item—a Renaissance-era Dante Chair, a fifty-year private collection from an anonymous donor!"

The auctioneer’s voice boomed as four gloved staff carried the chair onto the stage, draped in protective velvet.

"It’s here!" Jareth elbowed Thaddeus excitedly.

Then he froze.

Both Thaddeus and Evadne leaned forward in perfect sync, like puppets pulled by the same string.

They were ready to fight for it.

"Starting bid: three million!"

The room erupted.

Bidders raised paddles frantically. The auctioneer barely kept up.

Three million—the highest opening bid of the night.

Elspeth and Glynnis, who loved attention, hesitated at the price.

Acacia and her mother had already bowed out, silent as mice.

Then—

"Six million."

A smooth, feminine voice cut through the noise.

Everyone turned.

Evadne.

The mysterious beauty was making waves again.

"Did I hear right?" Glynnis gasped. "That country bumpkin just bid six million? Is she insane?"

Elspeth said nothing, her icy stare locked on Evadne’s back.

Then her gaze slid to Suri. A smirk curled her lips.

Did she think she could play princess? The Ashbournes would chew her up.

"Seven million."

Thaddeus’s voice was calm, but irritation simmered beneath.

She was really going all out for Cassius.

"Seven and a half."

Evadne didn’t flinch.

Another gasp.

Even Jareth stayed quiet.

This was a duel between titans.

"Eight million." Thaddeus’s tone was cool, but his eyes burned.

She clenched her jaw.

She could afford more—her personal funds were vast. But eight million was her limit. Anything beyond was just ego.

"Thad," Jareth hissed, "your EQ is in the negatives. She wants that chair. Just let her have it. You’re embarrassing her in public!"

"She’s here for Cassius," Thaddeus said flatly. "This is between him and me."

Jareth sighed. "You’re hopeless."

"Eight million, going once! Twice—"

"Ten!"

A clear voice rang out from the back.

Thaddeus didn’t turn, but his brow arched.

All eyes flew to Suri.

Evadne’s heart leapt.

Emeric must’ve sent her to ensure Cassius got the chair.

Thaddeus hesitated, then stayed silent.

Not because he couldn’t afford more—but continuing would be petty.

The K Group won the Dante Chair. Applause thundered.

Just as everyone thought it was over, the auctioneer grinned.

"Last item tonight—donated by the K Group! A masterpiece jewel, 'Ruby Enigma,' crafted by a renowned designer!"

Thaddeus’s breath caught.

His heart stopped.
###Chapter 42

Isabella Sinclair felt like she'd been electrocuted, her face draining of all color.

Olivia Bennett jumped in shock as if her veins had frozen solid.

"Holy hell! What was that?"

Sweat beading on her forehead, Isabella clenched her teeth. "Didn't you sell that necklace? Why is it at the auction?"

"I did sell it! This can't be happening!" Olivia gasped, horrified.

"What do we do now? Nathan is right there! He's going to see the gift he gave me being auctioned off. How do you think he'll feel about me? He's going to be furious!" Isabella's voice trembled with barely restrained tears.

"Calm down! Maybe there's more than one of these necklaces. It could just be a similar one."

"There's only one in the world! The auctioneer just announced it was the exact piece Nathan gave me! Do you really think he'd buy such a pathetic excuse?"

Mother and daughter exchanged panicked glances, their minds racing.

Isabella was scrambling for a way to explain this disaster to Nathan.

Olivia, meanwhile, was piecing together how the necklace she'd sold to the pawnshop ended up here—donated under the name of the Vanderbilt Group.

Suddenly, she stiffened, drawing curious looks from those nearby.

Was the pawnshop secretly owned by the Kingsley family?

With countless treasures passing through its doors daily, why would the Vanderbilts choose this particular necklace to donate? What were the odds?

Olivia's blood ran cold as her gaze locked onto Seraphina Lockwood with venomous intensity.

That scheming witch had to be behind this!

Only she knew the Ruby Enigma was Nathan's gift to Isabella. Consumed by jealousy, she must have manipulated the Vanderbilts into exposing it publicly—just to humiliate them!

Nathan Prescott's expression darkened like a storm cloud.

His chest heaved beneath his tailored suit, a cold sweat trickling down his temple.

"Nathan? Are you alright?" Daniel Carter frowned at his friend's uncharacteristic tension, clueless about the cause.

The Ruby Enigma symbolized Nathan's devotion to Isabella. From its custom design to the rare gemstone selection, every detail had been meticulously crafted with his own hands.

He'd never poured so much of himself into a gift for any woman.

Now, his heartfelt gesture was being auctioned off like cheap trinkets, stripping him bare for the world to mock.

"The Vanderbilt Group representative stated this necklace was a token of passion from a lover, making it priceless. True love transcends monetary value, so this piece will be auctioned without reserve!"

Isabella's vision blurred as if she'd been hit by a freight train.

The crowd's excitement surpassed even the frenzy over the Dante Chair earlier.

Nathan couldn't take it anymore. His eyes burned crimson with rage as he ground out through clenched teeth:

"Stop."

"What?"

"End the auction. That item belongs to me."

Daniel's jaw dropped.

Then Nathan noticed—Alexander Kingsley's seat was empty. Seraphina had vanished.

His fists smashed into the armrests with enough force to make Daniel flinch.

Seraphina. Her schemes were impeccable.

Had she finally gotten her fill of humiliating him?

But the show she'd orchestrated was just beginning, and Seraphina had already lost interest.

In the restroom, Seraphina studied her reflection with a heavy sigh.

The old Seraphina, though worldly, had retained an innocent heart. Sheltered by the Kingsley family, she'd never stooped to such tactics.

But now, without Nathan, why was her mind constantly plotting?

She recalled Nathan's shattered expression when the necklace appeared onstage. Maybe she'd gone too far.

She could've pretended not to recognize it. There was no need to publicly shame him. But she just couldn't let it go.

Not because she couldn't move on from their divorce—her thirteen-year obsession had already faded. She'd accepted that.

What she couldn't stomach was Nathan, usually so sharp, being blind to the fact that the woman he loved was rotten to the core.

"I need to stop meddling. This is the last time."

A bitter chuckle escaped her as pain lanced through her chest.

No more interfering in Nathan and Isabella's mess.

BANG!

The restroom door flew open with a violent crash.

Seraphina didn't even blink.

Isabella stormed in, her extravagant gown snagging on the tiles.

"Seraphina! You vicious witch!"

"Three years of the same insults. Don't you have any new material?" Seraphina smirked, unbothered.

"It was you! You put Nathan's gift to me up for auction! How could you sink so low?"

Isabella lunged forward but tripped on her hem, her dramatic entrance ruined as she faceplanted, her cheeks flushing scarlet.

"I merely donated an item honestly. No tricks involved. You're jumping to wild conclusions, Ms. Sinclair."

Seraphina stepped back warily—this rabid creature might actually bite.

"Seraphina! You can't have Nathan's love, so you resort to this? You think embarrassing us will drive us apart? Dream on!"

Isabella's eyes blazed with hatred.

"You sold the necklace willingly. What happens to it after isn't your concern. If you're upset, blame yourself—not others."

Seraphina turned to leave, done with this farce.

If not for Nathan, she wouldn't waste a second on this hypocrite.

"Wait! Get back here!"

Isabella grabbed Seraphina's wrist and yanked hard.

Seraphina hissed as pain shot up her arm.

Isabella had ripped off her bracelet—a precious heirloom from her grandfather—leaving an angry red mark.

"Give it back!" Seraphina's voice turned deadly.

Isabella clutched the stolen bracelet, seething. She'd coveted it since the moment she'd seen it, only for it to go to her least favorite person.

"Seraphina, you steal what's mine? If I can't have it, neither can you!"

With a cruel laugh, Isabella smashed the bracelet against the marble sink.

CRACK.

Seraphina's heart shattered along with the irreplaceable heirloom.
###Chapter 43

Isabella's chest heaved with such intense fury she thought she might suffocate.

Her grandfather's precious heirloom, her most treasured possession, had been callously destroyed by Victoria in an instant.

White-hot rage erupted through her veins like molten lava. She wanted to snap every bone in Victoria's body just like that shattered bracelet.

"Victoria!" Isabella's crimson eyes burned with fury as she screamed the name.

Victoria flinched momentarily before a venomous smirk twisted her lips. So what if she broke the bracelet? There were no witnesses. If she claimed self-defense, who would Alexander believe?

With calculated cruelty, Victoria scooped up the broken shards from the sink and pressed them against her own wrist.

Isabella realized her intent too late.

"Ahh!"

She watched in horror as Victoria dragged the sharp edge across her pale skin. Though avoiding major arteries, the wound bled profusely - a shocking crimson against porcelain skin.

Even Victoria seemed startled by her own actions. But the die was cast. She had to commit fully now.

With theatrical sobs, she fled the bathroom, leaving bloody droplets in her wake.

Isabella stood frozen, clutching the bracelet fragments until her knuckles turned white.

Only when she exited did the last stall door creak open silently.

Victoria's hysterical cries echoed through the hallway as she cradled her bleeding wrist. Auction guests recoiled from the spectacle, some pulling out phones to record the chaos.

"Alexander! Mother! Aunt Elspeth! Help me!" Victoria wailed with perfect dramatic timing.

Just as planned, she became the center of attention. Let Isabella try playing the victim now. To Alexander, she'd just be the jealous ex.

Elspeth, Margaret, and Arabella came rushing like startled hens.

"My darling! What happened to your hand?" Margaret's shrill voice carried through the hall. Her Oscar-worthy performance came naturally - she'd been waiting for this moment ever since Victoria left with Isabella.

Isabella observed coldly from the sidelines. The grand performance was just beginning.

Jareth's security team swiftly dispersed the growing crowd.

"Tell us what happened!" Elspeth demanded, playing her role perfectly.

Victoria collapsed into Alexander's arms like a wounded dove. "I... I met Ms. Sinclair in the bathroom. I tried to make peace but she... she..."

Isabella's mocking laughter cut through the drama.

Alexander's jaw tightened at her reaction. "Did you do this?" His voice was glacial.

The accusation pierced Isabella deeper than any blade. She clenched her fists until her nails drew blood.

Jareth facepalmed. Could his friend be any more obtuse?

Isabella's smile could have frozen hell over. "What if I did? Going to punish me, Mr. Kingsley?"

The standoff crackled with tension as the two women's gazes locked - one dripping false tears, the other burning with righteous fury.
###Chapter 44

Nathaniel's breath caught in his throat, his pulse hammering wildly.

His eyes widened in shock at the sight of his once-gentle ex-wife, now standing before him with a fire in her gaze and violence in her hands.

"Isabella, did you really do this?" Nathaniel demanded, his voice tight.

A slow, dangerous smile curved Isabella's lips, her striking beauty impossible to ignore.

Daniel clutched his chest, utterly captivated.

How could a woman look so breathtaking even when she was causing chaos?

"Nathaniel, what are you implying?"

Victoria, sensing Nathaniel's hesitation, immediately played the victim. "Are you seriously doubting me? Do you trust her more than your own fiancée?"

She couldn't fathom why Isabella would willingly take the blame.

But if Isabella wanted to dig her own grave, Victoria wouldn't stop her.

"Nathaniel, look at the monster you married!" Margaret wailed, clutching Victoria dramatically. "She nearly slit my daughter's wrist! She wanted to kill her!"

Nathaniel's jaw clenched, his expression darkening.

"Isabella, you were never like this before. You were soft, fragile. What happened to you?"

Sophia sneered, venom dripping from her words. "She's finally showing her true colors now that she's not tied to Nathaniel anymore. Thank goodness he divorced her in time and chose Victoria instead. Who knows what other schemes she had up her sleeve?"

"Sophia, watch your mouth!"

Daniel stepped forward, ready to defend Isabella, but she stopped him with a single glance.

Vanessa watched the exchange with bitter resentment, her dislike for her former sister-in-law deepening.

"Do whatever you want," Isabella said coolly.

"Apologize to Victoria," Nathaniel ordered, his voice icy.

As if their three years of marriage meant nothing.

Victoria barely suppressed her triumphant smile.

This was Isabella's downfall. Nathaniel would always be hers.

Isabella had given everything for him—her love, her devotion, her sacrifices. Yet all it took were Victoria's crocodile tears to make him turn on her.

A few fake sobs outweighed years of loyalty.

Isabella lifted her chin and strode toward Victoria.

Without hesitation, she swung her hand and struck Victoria hard across the face.

The sharp sound echoed through the room, leaving everyone stunned.

Nathaniel froze, a chill running down his spine.

"You—you hit me?" Victoria gasped, clutching her cheek.

"You deserved it."

Isabella's smile was razor-sharp. "That was for destroying the diamond bracelet my grandfather gave me. If you have a problem with me, come at me directly. But you went after something precious to me. Why?"

"Isabella!" Nathaniel roared, his fury erupting. His gaze flickered to her wrist, noticing the faint swelling from the force of her slap.

Her skin was delicate, bruises forming easily.

But his anger blinded him to her pain.

Margaret, Sophia, and Vanessa gaped in disbelief. How dare Isabella act so brazenly?

"Listen carefully," Isabella hissed, her voice trembling with rage. "From this moment on, Victoria and I are enemies. If I break this vow, may I end up just like this bracelet."

She slowly uncurled her left hand, revealing the shattered diamonds and the blood staining her palm.

Nathaniel's chest tightened at the sight.

She had loved that bracelet.

Even broken, she clung to it, oblivious to the cuts on her skin.

He couldn't speak, his gaze locked on her furious face.

"Ms. Sinclair! Your hand!"

Daniel panicked, searching his pockets for something to stop the bleeding, but he had nothing.

Nathaniel's fingers twitched toward his own handkerchief, but he hesitated.

Before he could move, a familiar floral scent filled the air as a woman in an emerald gown stepped forward.

Isabella's vision blurred slightly as Seraphina approached, carefully removing the shards from her palm and wrapping the wound with a silk handkerchief.

Tears pricked Isabella's eyes, but she bit them back.

"Such lovely hands shouldn't be hurt," Seraphina murmured, her voice steady despite the storm in her eyes.

"Seraphina! What a pleasant surprise!" Sophia forced a smile, scrambling to greet her.

Margaret simpered, trying to ingratiate herself.

Seraphina barely acknowledged them.

To her, Margaret was beneath notice.

"Sophia," Seraphina said curtly, only acknowledging her out of respect for Frederic.

Margaret flushed at the blatant dismissal.

"Does Seraphina know Ms. Sinclair?" Sophia probed, watching their interaction carefully. "Ah, of course—Ms. Sinclair is representing Alexander at the auction today. Her extravagant spending must have caught your eye, right?"

Seraphina's expression remained unreadable. "Naturally, I know Ms. Sinclair. She was Alexander's guest, after all."

"So, you're not particularly close?"

"Do I need to be?" Seraphina countered smoothly.

"I think it's relevant," Sophia pressed, smirking. "Because Ms. Sinclair might soon become the wife of K Group's president. That would make her family."

"Is Ms. Sinclair Alexander's girlfriend?" Seraphina asked, feigning ignorance.

"Exactly!" Sophia crowed. "The moment she divorced Nathaniel, she jumped into Alexander's car. I was worried for her—a country girl with no connections in Elmsworth. But then I saw she had Alexander to rely on, and I stopped worrying."

She shot Isabella a mocking grin.

Seraphina didn't respond immediately, the tension thickening.
###Chapter 45

Evadne didn't flinch.

She knew Elspeth's true colors all too well. Every word spoken painted a clear picture for Suri—Evadne wasn't just discarded by Thaddeus, but also a desperate woman clawing for a wealthy man's attention.

A cruel smirk curled on Acacia's lips, mirrored by her mother.

The Ashbournes and Abernathys had never been allies. Cassius, as Emeric's eldest son, held immense power. He could have any woman he desired with a mere glance. Why would he ever settle for Thaddeus's castoff?

Ridiculous.

Thaddeus's jaw tightened, irritation flashing in his eyes. "Elspeth, this doesn't concern you."

"Thaddeus, it concerns both our families!" Elspeth pressed, feigning concern. "If word gets out that Ms. Evadne divorced you and immediately latched onto Cassius, people will talk. They'll assume she was unfaithful. I'm trying to protect our reputations!"

Suri scoffed. "Ms. Evadne is divorced. She's free to love whomever she chooses. We Ashbournes don’t judge a woman for her past."

Jareth nearly cheered. Finally, someone said it.

Acacia and her mother paled, stunned into silence.

Was Suri actually defending Evadne?

Elspeth's face twisted. "Suri, you of all people should understand appearances matter! If she—"

"Enough." Suri's voice turned icy. "You're not Thaddeus's mother. You have no right to interfere."

Elspeth's mouth snapped shut.

"And Emeric and I aren't married yet," Suri added sharply. "Don't call me his 'legal wife' again."

Evadne bit her lip, a pang of grief hitting her.

Her mother had been Emeric's only true wife.

Thaddeus remained silent, his gaze locked on Evadne.

He'd never liked her. She was trouble, always stirring the pot.

Yet when Elspeth attacked her, it felt like an insult to him.

"Ms. Evadne, would you like me to take you to Cassius?" Suri offered kindly.

"Thank you." Evadne smiled, the perfect picture of grace.

Suri squeezed her hand. "Cassius has excellent taste."

"Wait."

Thaddeus's voice cut through the air, sharp with barely restrained anger. "Ms. Evadne, don’t you owe us an apology?"

Jareth groaned. He wished he could gag Thaddeus.

Evadne's heart ached. She met his gaze, her disappointment piercing him.

Then—

"It wasn't her!"

A sweet, trembling voice rang out.

Evadne turned, her breath catching.

"Mari!"

A girl in a simple white dress rushed forward, her hair styled into an absurd "cauliflower" mess—Glynnis's doing.

Mari, the overlooked Abernathy sister, had always been kind to Evadne.

Now, despite her fear, she stood her ground.

"I saw everything!" Mari blurted, hands shaking. "Ms. Acacia tore the bracelet herself! Evadne never touched her!"

Thaddeus's grip on Acacia loosened.

Acacia panicked. "She's lying! Mari doesn’t understand—"

"Actually," Jareth drawled, "she explained it perfectly."

Thaddeus's stare turned lethal. "You staged this?"

Acacia's knees buckled. The truth was written all over her face.

With a choked gasp, she fainted.

The drama ended with Acacia being wheeled away.

Later, in the parking lot, Jason finally arrived, horrified at the blood on Evadne's handkerchief.

"Who hurt you?" he demanded.

"It's nothing," Evadne said softly. "Suri handled it."

Suri sighed. "Evadne, why didn’t you tell them who you really are? They should fear crossing you."

Evadne shook her head. "That life is over. They don’t deserve to know me now."

Suri hugged her suddenly, voice thick. "It’s not fair."

Evadne smiled through the sting in her eyes. "With you here, it doesn’t have to be."
###Chapter 46

The moment Acacia regained consciousness, she found herself in a standard hospital room.

The doctors had assured everyone her injuries weren't severe. Though the cut was deep, stitches weren’t necessary.

Her fainting had been caused by sheer panic and stress.

"Honey! You're awake!"

Una hovered by the bedside, tears streaming down her face. "I thought I'd lost you forever!"

"Enough with the dramatics. Thaddeus isn’t here weeping like a child. You're making a scene."

Elspeth stood near the window, arms crossed, her expression icy. "Have you two even considered how to clean up this disaster?"

"What disaster?" Una wiped her tears, looking genuinely confused.

"Did you botch everything?"

Elspeth glared at her sister, frustration simmering. "I’ve spent years shielding you, guiding you. Without me, do you honestly think your daughter would stand a chance with Thaddeus? With your lack of wits, did you really believe she could marry into wealth? Not in this lifetime!"

Acacia clenched her jaw, resentment bubbling beneath the surface.

Her mother’s incompetence was infuriating.

To cover their debts, Una had sold the necklace Thaddeus gifted her—bad enough on its own. But selling it to the Ashbourne family, only for it to appear at an auction? That would ruin everything between her and Thaddeus!

"Elspeth, if you're going to speak to me like that—"

Una, usually the target of Elspeth’s scorn, bristled at being humiliated in front of her daughter. "Today, Acacia and I successfully framed Isabella. What about your daughter? Why did she interfere at the worst possible moment? If she hadn’t gotten involved, none of this would’ve happened!"

"How was I supposed to know Mari would be in the bathroom?" Elspeth snapped. "Acacia, what did I teach you? How could you be so careless when scheming, leaving behind evidence you didn’t even notice?"

Acacia stayed silent, swallowing her frustration.

"Regardless, there’s no solid proof Acacia harmed herself. If Thaddeus questions you, play dumb. He still has feelings for you—this will blow over."

Elspeth massaged her temples, her voice cold. "If not, I’ll make sure he forgives you."

"I understand, Auntie."

Acacia’s mind flashed to Suri’s fierce protection of Isabella. Jealousy gnawed at her. "Why does Isabella have their favor? Why does Suri treat her like a daughter? If this continues, she’ll destroy us!"

At the mention of Suri, Elspeth’s expression darkened.

"Suri isn’t even the Ashbourne family’s legal wife—just a mistress Emeric favors! I tolerate her out of respect for Chairman Emeric, yet she dares disrespect me!"

"Exactly! Auntie, you’re Uncle Frederic’s lawful wife. How can she compare?" Acacia quickly flattered Elspeth. She needed her aunt’s support to secure her place in the Abernathy family.

Una scoffed internally. Elspeth had no right to criticize Suri. Hadn’t she stolen her position too? If Thaddeus’s birth mother hadn’t been murdered, Elspeth—barren and scheming—would never have become Frederic’s wife.

"I won’t let Isabella marry into the Ashbourne family so easily. What good is Suri’s favor if Emeric doesn’t approve?"

Elspeth’s eyes glinted with malice. "Frederic told me Emeric values family reputation above all. Cassius is his chosen heir—he’d never allow his son to marry some country girl. Let Isabella enjoy her temporary victory. I’ll make sure she regrets crossing me."

The door to the ward burst open.

A chilling presence filled the room as Thaddeus stepped inside.

"Thaddeus." Acacia immediately put on a fragile act, her voice trembling.

"I have questions for you."

Her grip tightened on the sheets, her eyes darting to Elspeth for help.

"Thaddeus, Acacia just woke up. She’s been through enough. Can’t this wait?" Elspeth interjected smoothly.

"Some things need answers now." His tone left no room for negotiation.

"Mr. Abernathy, this is all my fault! Blame me, not my daughter!"

Una threw herself at his feet, sobbing. "The Stirling family is drowning in debt. Factories are closing. The Abernathy family refused aid, and the Ashbournes are crushing us. I sold Acacia’s jewelry behind her back—I didn’t know that necklace was from you! If I had, I’d rather starve than part with it!"

Acacia exhaled in relief, tears welling as she shot Elspeth a pleading look. "Mom, how could you? That was my most treasured gift."

But Thaddeus’s gaze remained cold. "That’s not what I came to ask."

Compared to framing Isabella, the necklace was trivial.

He could overlook the betrayal if it was truly for her family’s survival.

What he couldn’t forgive was targeting an innocent person.

"Did you injure yourself, or did Isabella harm you? Did her bracelet break by accident, or did you snatch it?" His voice was calm, but his eyes were sharp.

"Thaddeus, are you accusing me of framing Isabella?" Acacia’s voice cracked. "Does our childhood bond mean nothing compared to your deceitful ex-wife?"

Thaddeus frowned. "Mari doesn’t lie. She said she never saw Isabella touch you."

"Mari’s mental state is fragile. Her words can’t be trusted. She might’ve missed it." Elspeth rushed to defend.

Thaddeus smirked coldly. "Do mothers usually belittle their own children in public? I wouldn’t know—I never had one."

Elspeth’s face paled.

Thaddeus, usually silent at home, had just humiliated her.

"Acacia, why do this? If I chose you, I won’t go back to Isabella. Why provoke her?" His voice was low, disappointment weighing on him like chains.

He still called her "Acacia"—a shred of respect for their past, for the light she’d once been in his darkest days.

But that light was flickering.

"I didn’t! It wasn’t me!" Acacia screamed, pounding the bed, her eyes wild. "She stole you! Now she’s making me the villain! Glynnis told me Isabella was always close to Mari—this is their plot! Thaddeus, do you believe them over me? Are you falling for her? Do you not want me anymore?"

"I’ve always loved you. Even married to Isabella, I never touched her. My feelings never changed." His control wavered, his headache worsening.

He remembered Isabella taking the blame without hesitation, her swollen wrist, the devastation in her eyes when she looked at him.

Thaddeus inhaled sharply, his vision blurring. "But Acacia, I don’t recognize you anymore. Do you even want to be with me?"

"No! Thaddeus, please—!"

She scrambled off the bed, but he was already walking away. The door slammed shut, leaving her in silence.

Acacia kicked the door in rage—then shrieked in pain.

She wouldn’t let Isabella win.

If Isabella wanted war, she’d get one.
###Chapter 47

The Sapphire Nights Club pulsed with life, its neon lights casting an electric glow over the sleek, modern interior. Owned by Lucas Grant, the exclusive venue was a playground for the elite.

Tonight, Alexander Kingsley was in a rare mood—dark and brooding. He needed a drink, and he needed it now.

Lucas himself arrived to pick him up. It wasn’t often Alexander sought his company like this.

"You make me feel like your secret mistress," Lucas teased, leaning in close.

To the world, Lucas was untouchable—a man of power and influence. But around Alexander, he was just an old friend who talked too much.

"I’ve never groveled for a woman’s attention," Lucas continued dramatically. "But for you? I’m like some desperate lover waiting by the phone. It’s pathetic!"

Alexander arched a brow. "Never groveled? What about Vanessa Wright?"

Lucas groaned. "That was a one-time weakness! Vanessa is… exceptional."

Alexander’s jaw tightened. He swallowed back the urge to snap at him.

Just then, two stunning foreign women sauntered past, one flashing Lucas a sultry smile.

"Now that’s beauty," Lucas murmured, eyes tracking them.

Alexander barely glanced their way. "Not as striking as her."

Lucas froze. "Her? You mean your ex-wife?" He gasped. "Alexander Kingsley, are you telling me you’ve actually fallen for Isabella Sinclair? I thought it was just a contract marriage! Or—wait—" He smirked. "Spending all that time with a woman like her… feelings were bound to happen, huh?"

Alexander stiffened, his fingers tightening around his whiskey glass.

He had seen her bare skin. He had touched her.

Even now, his fingertips tingled with the memory of her softness.

"I didn’t touch her," he muttered, then downed his drink.

Impossible. He couldn’t have feelings for her. Not like that.

After a few more rounds, Lucas leaned in. "Alexander, I need to ask you something. It’s been bothering me."

"Go ahead."

"Why Evelyn Prescott? Why her?"

Lucas slung an arm around Alexander’s shoulders. "You saw how those women treated Isabella today. If Margaret hadn’t stepped in, they would’ve torn her apart. Doesn’t that bother you?"

Alexander’s expression darkened. Memories surfaced—painful ones.

"My mother jumped from a building," he said quietly. "Depression. Frederic’s cruelty. The whispers. I wanted to die with her. I tried."

He rolled up his sleeve, revealing a jagged scar.

Lucas inhaled sharply.

"Evelyn found me. Saved me. She was the only one who cared. Brought me sweets, invited me over, shared her toys. She was my light when everything was dark. I promised her. And I keep my promises."

Lucas sighed. "People change, Alexander. The Evelyn you knew might not exist anymore. What if she’s nothing like the girl you remember? Will you still choose her?"

Alexander fastened his watch, his frown deepening.

Isabella’s tear-filled eyes flashed in his mind.

His chest tightened. He took another drink.

"You’re stubborn," Lucas muttered. "The only woman who matters more to you than Evelyn is Natalia Petrov. The one you’ve been searching for all these years."

At the mention of Natalia, Alexander’s gaze sharpened. "Any news?"

Lucas shook his head. "The trail’s cold. You never even saw her face clearly. It’s like she vanished."

Alexander’s hope dimmed. Five years. Five years of searching for the girl who dragged him to safety on the Zenithian battlefield.

"If I find her," he said quietly, "I’ll repay her. Whatever she asks."

Lucas smirked. "What if she asks for you?"

"Gratitude isn’t love," Alexander said flatly.

"Good. At least you know the difference."

By the time they left, their driver was waiting.

"One more thing," Alexander said abruptly.

Lucas yawned. "What?"

"Why did Isabella admit to it? Why didn’t she defend herself?"

Lucas shrugged. "Maybe she just doesn’t care anymore."

Alexander’s grip on the car door turned his knuckles white. "Doesn’t care about what?"

"You’re divorced. Why would she care what you think? Or the Abernathys? Maybe she’s just done." Lucas climbed into his car. "If I were her, I’d have slapped you by now."

The door shut.

Alexander stood there, breath trapped in his lungs like a vise.
###Chapter 48

Ever since the charity gala, Isabella had locked herself in her room, drowning in misery.

By dusk the next day, Sebastian and Nathaniel had come to check on her. Though Isabella dragged herself downstairs to see them, her exhaustion was palpable. "Isabella, Olivia told me what happened at the auction," Sebastian said, his gaze lingering on his sister's bandaged hand. His chest tightened. "How's the injury? Did Alexander change the dressing? Does it still hurt? Any signs of infection?"

"I can take care of it myself. He's swamped—I don't want to burden him further," Isabella murmured, her voice hollow.

"Alexander is becoming utterly unreliable!" Nathaniel snapped, fury darkening his expression. "If we hadn't run into Olivia on our way back, we wouldn't even have known the Vanderbilts humiliated you at the auction. I'm filing a lawsuit tomorrow. Get our legal team ready. Defamation charges. They need to pay for this."

"Forget it. It's not worth it," Isabella whispered, her energy completely drained.

She knew if this escalated, her father would hear about it. Though he couldn't interfere directly, she refused to let him worry over her.

That didn’t mean she’d let the Vanderbilts off the hook.

Isabella stared at her wounded hand, then at the diamond bracelet she’d spent two painstaking days repairing. Rage simmered beneath her skin.

"Your brothers heard you were hurt. They’re frantic. They’re all flying back right now," Sebastian said, pulling her into a comforting embrace.

"It’s just a scratch! They can’t abandon their work over something this trivial!" Isabella panicked, immediately grabbing her phone to call them.

"If anyone dares to come back now, I won’t speak to them for a year!"

"You might not stop Oliver Sinclair," Nathaniel smirked, pointing upward. "His plane should be in the air by now."

Isabella sighed in defeat. Her brother always had to one-up her with his dramatic gestures.

"Fine. I’ve done my sisterly duty!"

Then, turning to Sebastian, she said, "Take me back to Skyrimter. I want to visit the Starry Villa."

Ever since Seraphina defended Isabella, the women of the Vanderbilt and Sterling families had turned against her.

Life at home had already been suffocating. Now, with open hostility, it was unbearable.

"You traitor! Did Isabella bribe you? Are you her spy, sent to ruin us?"

Drunk and furious, Genevieve stormed into Seraphina’s room, screaming, "You act so sweet, but you’re just a snake! I used to think you were harmless. Turns out you were playing dumb, waiting to stab us in the back!"

"I’m not lying! Isabella didn’t bribe me. I told the truth!"

Terrified, Seraphina clutched her favorite teddy bear. "You all bully my sister-in-law. I won’t let you hurt her anymore!"

Genevieve yanked Seraphina’s hair hard.

"Ow! That hurts!"

"Who said you could perm your hair again? Did you forget my rules? You don’t get to change your hair without my permission!" Genevieve seethed, pulling harder.

Truthfully, her rage wasn’t just about Isabella. That was Acacia’s problem, not hers.

The real reason? Jareth—the man she’d been obsessed with—had approached Seraphina on his own. He’d even smiled and patted her head.

The sight made Genevieve burn with jealousy. She wanted to shave Seraphina bald.

"I see your game. You’re not helping Isabella out of kindness. You just want to play the hero to catch Jareth’s attention, don’t you?"

Tears streamed down Seraphina’s face. She didn’t know how to respond.

"You’re just defying us. We hate Isabella, so you side with her to prove how ‘righteous’ you are?"

Genevieve’s usually sweet face twisted with malice. "Stop pretending to be innocent! No one’s fooled. You think Jareth would ever fall for an idiot like you? Dream on!"

"What’s going on here?" Alva rushed in, pulling Seraphina into her arms.

This kind of scene happened so often in the Vanderbilt household that none of the other servants dared intervene.

But Alva was Nathaniel’s trusted aide, a longtime Vanderbilt servant known for her kindness. She was the only one brave enough to stand up for Seraphina.

"Alva, stay out of this! This doesn’t concern you!" Genevieve snapped.

"You’re the one who needs to leave!"

As Alva soothed the trembling girl, she shot Genevieve a sharp glare. "Walk out now, and I’ll pretend I saw nothing. Otherwise, when Mr. Vanderbilt returns, I’ll tell him exactly how you’ve been tormenting Seraphina."

Genevieve faltered, frustration gnawing at her.

If Nathaniel found out about her true nature, he’d definitely tell Jareth—they were inseparable. And if Jareth knew, her pursuit of him would be doomed.

Reluctantly, Genevieve backed down.

But she wasn’t done. On her way out, she snatched Seraphina’s teddy bear and hurled it out the window.

"My bear!"

"Useless trash!"

Seraphina didn’t even stop for shoes. She bolted barefoot into the night.

Nathaniel had just returned to Windermere Estate when he saw her frantic figure.

"Seraphina, what’s wrong?" He caught her, frowning.

Though he despised Elspeth and disliked Genevieve, he’d always had a soft spot for Seraphina—especially after she courageously defended Isabella.

"My bear… I lost my bear." Seraphina burst into tears.

"Don’t worry. I’ll help you find it."

Nathaniel led her to the garden.

Finally, in a muddy flowerbed, they spotted the abandoned teddy bear.

Nathaniel was fastidious—his custom leather shoes were always immaculate. Yet he stepped into the dirt without hesitation, retrieving the filthy toy himself.

The bear was ruined, but Seraphina clutched it like treasure, sobbing uncontrollably.

Nathaniel wasn’t an emotional man, but her tears struck something in him.

"Throw it away. I’ll buy you a new one tomorrow."

"No! This was a gift from Isabella. It’s my favorite!"

Nathaniel blinked, surprised by her loyalty.

Seraphina remembered Isabella’s kindness—the dark days without her, her father’s neglect, her mother’s indifference, her sister’s cruelty.

"Brother!"

Suddenly, she threw herself into Nathaniel’s arms, crying, "Can sister-in-law come back? I miss her so much. Can’t you two fix things?"

Nathaniel’s lips parted, his throat tight with unspoken emotion.

He ruffled her hair but couldn’t bring himself to answer.

Then his phone rang.

His grandfather.

The call only deepened his turmoil.

"Grandfather."

"Why can’t I reach Isabella again?"

Hamilton’s voice trembled with worry. "What’s wrong with her? She hasn’t visited me! Did she decide to cut me off? You brat! If this is your fault, I’ll disown you!"

"Grandfather, Isabella would never abandon you. Don’t overthink it." Nathaniel massaged his temples, exhaustion weighing on him.

"Find her for me! I need to see her! Now!"
###Chapter 49

The Ashbourne siblings returned to Skyrim from Elmsworth under the cover of night.

The distance between the two cities wasn't vast - barely a two-hour drive along the highway.

Elmsworth pulsed as the nation's economic powerhouse, overflowing with resources and opportunities that made every elite family salivate.

Skyrim told a different story. For over a century, the Ashbournes had ruled supreme here.

Their empire fueled a third of Skyrim's economy, earning them the moniker "Skyrim's Uncrowned Monarchs." Without the Ashbournes, Skyrim would have remained just another provincial town, its growth stunted.

The siblings arrived at Starry Villa.

"Miss Evadne! When did you return?" The excited greeting came from elderly caretaker Mr. Louis, who'd grown up alongside Emeric Ashbourne.

Mr. Louis lived simply, content with his bachelor life at Starry Villa despite Emeric's Elmsworth real estate ventures.

"Mr. Louis! How's your health? Still getting joint pain when it rains? Are you taking the medicine I sent?" Evadne linked arms with him, smiling warmly.

"All good, all good! But having you back is even better!" Mr. Louis wiped joyful tears.

"I need your help," Evadne confessed. "I broke a friend's gift and need to replace it before they notice."

"What is it?"

Instead of answering, Evadne carefully extracted a shattered diamond bracelet from her jewelry pouch.

"Such exquisite craftsmanship! What a tragedy!" Mr. Louis winced at the damage.

"I know it's difficult, but I must try. May I use your tools? Some diamonds are missing - I recall you have a collection here. I need matching stones." Evadne's determination shone through.

Mr. Louis gaped in stunned silence.

Cas sius coughed awkwardly while Arnold's fingers hovered over his emergency dial.

Only Evadne could drop such bombshells so casually.

"Absolutely not! This requires master craftsmanship!" Mr. Louis protested, his protective tone mirroring Emeric's.

Evadne's eyes glittered mischievously at the thought of punishing Elvis for ignoring her warnings. "Put it under Elvis's account. If he complains, tell him I forced you - and charge him double. The spoiled brat won't miss the money."

Mr. Louis clutched his chest dramatically.

Cas sius and Arnold rushed to support him.

The Ashbournes owned four legendary Skyrim gardens: The Moon, The Cloud, The Mist, and The Star.

The Star's natural beauty had first captivated master sculptor Patrick. Emeric's extravagant purchase nearly destroyed their friendship - until gifting it for Patrick's sixtieth birthday revealed his surprise plan all along.

Now, with Patrick gone, Mr. Louis inherited Starry Villa.

As Evadne followed Mr. Louis to the storeroom, Cas sius and Arnold relaxed.

"Evadne's devotion to the Abernathys makes me jealous," Arnold grumbled.

"Mr. Hamilton Abernathy has always cherished her. Evadne repays kindness with loyalty. I fully support this," Cas sius murmured.

"You'd support her even if she chose Thaddeus!"

"Some bonds defy reason. The more opposition they face, the more fiercely Evadne loves," Cas sius sighed.

"It's unjust! Thaddeus never deserved her! Yet enduring his cruelty made her stronger - now no man can deceive her so easily." Arnold's fists clenched.

Cas sius's phone vibrated on the table.

Thaddeus's name flashed onscreen.

"Mr. Thaddeus." Cas sius answered icily.

Arnold leaned forward, ears pricked.

"President Ashbourne, I need to speak with Evadne." Thaddeus's deep voice carried uncharacteristic urgency.

"She's unavailable."

"When will she be available?"

"For you? Never."

Cas sius's words cut like honed steel - a rare show of his protective fury.

Arnold pumped his fist silently. Exactly right!

On the other end, Thaddeus fought to control his temper.

"First, Evadne changed her number - respect that boundary. Second, I know everything about the charity auction incident."

Thaddeus froze, thorny vines of dread tightening around his chest.

Arnold shivered at his brother's uncharacteristic coldness.

Cas sius continued: "I tolerate many things, but never anyone harming Evadne. This is your first and last warning: control your fiancée and family. If they harass Evadne again, consequences will follow."

The call ended abruptly.

At Windermere Estate, Thaddeus stared at his darkened screen, an invisible hand squeezing his heart.

With Cas sius's refusal, panic surged - Evadne might truly vanish from his life forever.

His trembling hands retrieved a long-forgotten cigarette pack. Only two remained.

Several failed attempts later, the flame finally caught, illuminating his troubled expression.

For his supposedly unloved ex-wife, he'd broken five years of abstinence.

Deep in Starry Villa's workshop, sweat beaded on Evadne's forehead as she worked tirelessly.

Nothing matched!

None of these diamonds could replace her grandfather's bracelet!

Her eyes burned with determination as she refused to stop until finding the perfect match - she couldn't face her grandfather otherwise.

Suddenly, thunderous rotor blades shook the villa's foundations.

Evadne remained focused, oblivious to the commotion.

The door burst open, a gale-force wind whipping through the room.

Outside, a helicopter's cabin door slid open, revealing long legs encased in black trousers. The man's coat billowed dramatically as he stepped into the night.

"Evadne! I'm back!"
###Chapter 50

Isabella's eyelids fluttered open, revealing eyes clouded with melancholy as they focused on the striking man before her.

He had materialized like a midnight gust, now kneeling at her feet with an intensity that made her breath catch.

"I heard my baby sister doesn't recognize her big brother anymore?" His lips curled in that familiar smirk, equal parts dangerous and affectionate.

"Sebastian." The name slipped from her lips like a prayer.

"Ah, hearing that makes everything right again."

Oliver's entire demeanor shifted instantly. The usual ice in his gaze melted into something warm and golden, like sunrise over the vineyards.

One strong arm encircled her waist while his free hand produced a chocolate bar from his pocket. With practiced ease, he tore the wrapper with his teeth and offered it to her.

"Imported. Your favorite. Taste it."

"Oliver!"

Suddenly she was in his arms, her face buried against his chest. The floodgates opened - tears of longing for her brother, guilt toward their grandfather, fury at Victoria, frustration over the shattered bracelet, and heartbreak over Alexander all poured out.

"Isabella? You're crying?" Oliver froze, then gently cradled the back of her neck.

"No." The denial was muffled against his shirt.

"My shirt's soaked through and you're telling me you're not crying?"

"I said I'm not!"

Her voice cracked but the stubbornness remained. Oliver knew his sister's pride better than anyone. The rare tears meant something was deeply wrong, so he simply held her, letting his silent presence speak volumes. His jaw tightened with unspoken rage: Isabella, I'm home now. That bastard Alexander will pay for hurting you.

Outside the door, William and Harrison exchanged glances.

"Damn him! Isabella never acts this way with me," Harrison grumbled, grinding his teeth. "He disappears for months then waltzes back in and steals her affection. I hate him!"

"The helicopter landing probably destroyed half the rose garden."

William sighed, rubbing his temples. "Tell Oliver the landscaping bill is coming out of his trust fund."

By dawn, Isabella still hadn't found the matching diamond, exhaustion finally claiming her in the workshop.

Mr. Dubois had prepared quarters for her at the estate. Oliver carried her upstairs, laying her gently on the canopied bed.

After tucking the blankets around her and pressing a kiss to her forehead, he slipped out silently.

"Couldn't even bring back a decent gift after globetrotting? Just a chocolate bar? You're getting cheap in your old age." Harrison leaned against the hallway wall, arms crossed.

"Must you always be so dramatic?" Oliver shot back.

"You should address me properly - as your elder brother!" Harrison scowled.

"I'll call you 'elder brother' when hell freezes over."

Enraged, Harrison lunged but Oliver sidestepped effortlessly, sending his brother stumbling into the wall.

"Still can't control that temper, can you?" Oliver's laughter echoed through the corridor - genuine mirth he hadn't felt in years, not amidst the constant tension of intelligence operations.

Watching his younger brothers bicker, William allowed himself a rare smile, childhood memories surfacing.

"Speaking of gifts..." Oliver's eyes gleamed as he produced a sleek silver case.

The biometric lock disengaged with a click. William's expression darkened while Harrison gasped.

"New prototype from R&D. Left trigger delivers a tranquilizer strong enough to drop a bull. Right trigger... well, let's just say it's permanent retirement. This lighter?" He flipped the elegant silver piece in his palm. "Micro grenade. Takes out a room with one flick. And this—"

Oliver's voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper as he revealed a stunning emerald ring. "Our sister loves jewelry, doesn't she?"

Harrison reached for it but Oliver caught his wrist in an iron grip.

"Don't. The prong delivers a neurotoxin more potent than cobra venom."

"Christ," William muttered.

"Isabella's lucky to have survived your 'gifts' this long!" Harrison exclaimed.

"You don't understand. These are practical presents."

Oliver's gaze turned arctic. "Especially for that bastard Alexander. Let's see how our sister wants him to sleep - temporarily or forever."

Harrison was momentarily speechless.

"How long are you staying?" William interjected.

"Two weeks, maybe." Regret colored Oliver's tone. "Critical mission next month requires preparation. Otherwise I'd stay longer."

"Focus on your work. We'll look after Isabella."

William hesitated before adding softly, "Will you visit Father? He asked about you recently."

Oliver's expression shuttered. "Every time I see him, he says I'm shortening his lifespan. Maybe absence really does make the heart grow fonder."

The brothers exchanged uneasy glances.

Even Isabella was warming to their father's new family, but Oliver could never forgive the betrayal of their mother's memory.

Military school had been his escape, then the intelligence service became his life, severing ties with everything but his siblings.

Lately though, something had shifted. The longing for home, for their chaotic but loving dynamic, grew stronger each day.

"Harrison." Oliver slung an arm around his brother's shoulders, their earlier animosity forgotten. "Feel like causing some trouble?"

Harrison's eyes narrowed in understanding. "Not happening. Isabella made us promise not to confront Alexander alone. I won't break her trust."

Oliver's grin turned feral as Harrison ducked away. "Your loss."
###Chapter 51

Isabella Sinclair had locked herself inside Starry V for three straight days.

She was obsessed with finding the perfect diamond to repair the bracelet her grandfather had given her. Sleep became a luxury—she'd collapse in her studio when exhaustion hit, grab a quick meal when she woke, then dive right back into work.

Her brothers were banished from the villa during the day, but every evening, they canceled all engagements just to return and have dinner with her.

Despite the lavish spreads they prepared, she barely touched her food, pushing pasta around her plate with a vacant stare.

Her brothers exchanged helpless glances.

They knew nothing about jewelry.

"Ms. Isabella."

She blinked, snapping out of her daze, and turned to Mr. Louis with tired eyes.

He pulled out a velvet box from behind him and slid it across the table.

"What's this?"

"Open it."

Frowning, she lifted the lid—and froze.

Her breath caught.

Inside lay a diamond bracelet, nearly identical to her grandfather's.

"This belonged to Mr. Alexander. One of his finest pieces. He intended it for the woman he loved... but never got the chance to give it to her." Mr. Louis sighed.

"Lover?" Sebastian arched a brow. "I thought Mr. Alexander never married."

"Everyone has a first love," Mr. Louis said dryly.

"Frankly, I assumed he preferred men," Oliver joked, swirling his drink. "So what happened? Cold feet?"

"They grew up together. He teased her mercilessly, never realizing his feelings until it was too late. On her wedding day, she was in a car crash. Brain dead before he could even say goodbye."

A heavy silence fell over the table.

"After that, he shut himself off. Never loved again. But that doesn’t mean he couldn’t. How many men today could love as deeply as he did?"

Isabella’s chest tightened with envy.

"Sounds like he brought it on himself," Oliver muttered.

Three pairs of eyes glared at him.

A bitter taste filled Isabella’s mouth.

If a man as cold as Mr. Alexander could love so fiercely—what did that say about Nathan?

In three years of marriage, had he ever looked at her with real passion?

Did he regret losing her now?

No.

If he did, he wouldn’t keep tearing her down. If he did, he wouldn’t side with those vipers without a second thought.

The divorce had stripped her of his name, but not his cruelty.

She scoffed inwardly, downing her drink in one burning gulp.

Comparing Nathan to Mr. Alexander was an insult.

"Ms. Isabella, take this bracelet. It’s the closest match to yours."

"I can’t. It’s his legacy—"

"His will states you’re all free to take anything of his."

Her eyes stung.

"You’ve barely slept trying to fix yours. He’d want you to have it." Mr. Louis pressed the box into her hands.

That night, the Sinclair siblings left Starry V, bidding Mr. Louis farewell.

In the back of the Rolls-Royce, Isabella slumped against Sebastian, exhausted, clutching the box like a lifeline.

"Isabella," he said hoarsely, "Nathan contacted me the night you returned to New York."

"I know." Her voice was flat.

"I told him to stay away. Wasn’t kind about it."

"Good. I’m the CEO of Phoenix Rising now. He doesn’t get to waltz back in."

"You’re the queen of this family," Sebastian murmured, brushing her hair back.

11:21 PM

"Phone." She held out her hand.

He handed it over without question. "Passcode’s your birthday."

"Obviously."

She scrolled, then blocked Nathan’s number with a decisive tap.

Sebastian chuckled. "Brutal."

"He needs to learn his place." Her voice was ice.

Meanwhile, Nathan Prescott hadn’t eaten or slept properly in days.

His ex-wife had vanished.

No calls. No texts. Nothing.

Even worse—Hamilton wouldn’t stop pestering him like a lovesick teenager.

"Sir, should we file a missing person’s report?" Gordon suggested. "Technically, you’re still married. It’s not weird for a husband to report his wife missing."

Nathan shot him a withering glare.

"Well, what else can we do? She’s off-grid. No phone, no friends, and the one person who could reach her just blocked you!"

Nathan’s eye twitched.

Last night, he’d tried calling Sebastian—only to discover he’d been blocked.

For the first time in his life, he felt powerless.

Humiliated.

He grabbed his coat.

"Get the car. We’re going to The Regal Palace."

Back in New York, Isabella threw herself into work.

Jason had been holding down the fort in her absence. Seeing her return with fire in her eyes, he finally relaxed.

The hotel’s occupancy had risen by 20%. Not groundbreaking, but progress.

She’d revamped the menus, launched a food festival—now, guests were coming just to dine. Profits were climbing.

But she wanted more.

She wanted to crush the Prescott Group’s hotels.

In love, she’d lost.

In business? She refused to lose to Nathan.

"Someone actually booked the Presidential Suite? After two years?" She glanced up from financial reports.

"Guess who?" Jason massaged her shoulders expertly.

"Not Lucas again?"

"Vanessa."

Isabella’s brows shot up. "Why would she need that much space?"

"Party with three friends. Later, two male models slipped in. They... kept busy. Thank God for soundproofing. The models left at 5 AM—probably to avoid paparazzi."

"I knew Vanessa was messy, but two men for three women? Disgusting." She wrinkled her nose. "Burn the sheets after checkout. I don’t want guests catching something."

Just then, Jason’s phone rang.

His face darkened instantly.

"What?" Isabella snapped.

"Vanessa’s causing a scene in the lobby. Accusing our staff of theft."
###Chapter 52

The lobby of The Regal Palace buzzed with murmurs as guests craned their necks to witness the commotion.

"Madam, please compose yourself. A lady of your standing shouldn't cause such a scene in public. Let's discuss this privately in the conference room." The manager's voice trembled as he attempted to placate Natalia.

"So even VIP guests like me get robbed in your establishment? What does that say about your security?" Natalia's diamond-encrusted nails struck the marble counter with a sharp crack, her glare piercing through the trembling staff.

Whispers rippled through the crowd. Some recognized her as the Vanderbilt heiress, though her current behavior resembled a common street brawler.

"I didn't take anything." The housekeeper's whisper was barely audible, her gaze fixed on the polished floor.

"How dare you lie to my face?" Natalia's manicured hand shot toward the girl's eyes, stopping millimeters short when the manager intervened.

"My sapphire necklace was on the vanity. Did it sprout wings and fly away?"

"I cleaned the suite, but other staff had access too." Though pale, the housekeeper held her ground.

"Are you accusing us?" One of Natalia's socialite friends gasped dramatically.

"Darling, we could buy your entire family with pocket change. Why would we steal?" Another sneered, examining her flawless manicure.

"I expected better from a Kingsley property. The service here is deplorable compared to Vanderbilt hotels." Natalia's smirk oozed condescension.

The manager's jaw tightened. The Regal Palace catered to elite clientele, and this was the first time in years he'd encountered such vulgar behavior.

"Natalia, you're slandering our reputation and harassing staff without proof. Is this how Vanderbilt heirs conduct themselves?"

The voice cut through the tension like chilled champagne - crisp, elegant, and commanding.

All eyes turned to the striking woman in a cream Valentino suit. Isabella entered with regal poise, her Louboutins clicking like a countdown to confrontation.

Natalia's entourage visibly recoiled.

"You?" Natalia's lip curled at the sight of her former sister-in-law. "What are you doing here?"

Isabella's ensemble - from her custom-tailored blazer to the Cartier earrings glittering at her lobes - screamed old money sophistication. The crowd admired her quietly, unaware she was the exiled Vanderbilt daughter.

Beside this vision of refined elegance, Natalia's gaudy designer ensemble looked cheap and desperate.

At that moment, Alexander and Daniel entered through the revolving doors.

Daniel gasped. "Mr. Kingsley! It's Isabella!"

His excitement faded when he noticed the crowd. "And Natalia's making a scene... should we intervene?"

Alexander's gut twisted at the sight of his ex-wife, but he held up a hand. "Wait. Let's observe."

The accused housekeeper burst into tears at Isabella's arrival. "Manager Sinclair, I swear I didn't—"

"Miss Sinclair now, is it? Do you miss being Mrs. Kingsley?" Natalia's barbed question hung in the air.

"Not particularly." Isabella's smile didn't reach her stormy eyes. "I find my current position far more... humanizing."

The words struck Alexander like a slap.

Humanizing? During their marriage, she'd wanted for nothing! The Kingsley name, unlimited credit, staff at her beck and call - how dare she act like some abused prisoner?

His jaw clenched. The woman before him - poised, commanding, radiating quiet authority - bore no resemblance to the meek wife he remembered.

"Natalia, since you claim your necklace is worth over $200,000, we're obligated to involve the police." Isabella's tone was all business. "The sooner we file a report, the better our chances of recovery. My staff and I will fully cooperate - security footage, personal searches, whatever's necessary."

Murmurs of approval spread through the crowd.

"Exactly! Let the professionals handle this!" someone called out.

"She probably just misplaced it," another guest muttered.

Natalia's composure cracked. "Calling the police is pointless! The thief's probably long gone!"

"I'm no thief!" The housekeeper shook with indignation.

Isabella remained unflappable. "Our surveillance covers every inch except restrooms and staff areas. I've already secured all relevant personnel. If theft occurred, the necklace is still on premises." She held up her phone. "And I've already notified authorities. They'll be here shortly. As for your demanded apology - if we're at fault, you'll have it."

The crowd murmured approval. Even Daniel looked impressed. "Isabella handles crises like a seasoned CEO!"

Alexander shot him a glare, though privately agreed. This confident, quick-thinking woman was a far cry from the timid spouse he'd divorced.

"Fine! You said it, not me!" Natalia spat.

"Of course. The Regal Palace takes responsibility for genuine grievances." Isabella's smile was ice-cold.

Just then, security arrived holding an evidence bag. "We found it! The missing necklace!"

The revelation sent shockwaves through the lobby.

Natalia and her friends froze, their smug expressions crumbling.
###Chapter 53

Nathaniel held the broken necklace directly in front of Evelyn, his expression as cold as if he were discussing a business transaction.

"Evelyn, is this the necklace you lost?"

Evelyn snatched it from his hand and let out a sharp gasp. "My necklace! What happened to it? Who did this?"

All eyes turned to the shattered pieces of what had once been a luxurious diamond necklace.

"Our manager was informed of your missing necklace and immediately ordered a thorough search of the presidential suite," Nathaniel explained calmly. "We found it beneath the sofa. But when we did, it was already in this condition. We don’t know how it happened."

"See? I told you she was lying!" a guest sneered. "She probably misplaced it herself and then blamed the hotel staff. Just because she’s rich doesn’t mean she can accuse innocent people!"

"Goodness, that diamond was enormous! Who wears something that flashy anyway? It’s practically begging for trouble!" another muttered.

Evelyn’s face twisted with fury. "So what if you found it? That doesn’t prove your staff didn’t steal it! She probably hid it under the sofa to sell later!"

"I didn’t!" the waitress cried, her voice trembling. "I would never!"

"If someone had stolen it, they wouldn’t have broken it," Isabella interjected coolly. "This wasn’t theft—it was deliberate. Someone wanted to destroy it, not take it. Maybe out of jealousy."

Evelyn froze.

Her two friends exchanged uneasy glances, suddenly silent.

"Since the necklace has been recovered, there’s no evidence of theft," Isabella continued. "If you insist on pursuing this, I’ll see it through to the end."

She glanced at Evelyn’s companions. "My assistant handled the necklace carefully. The police will be here soon. They can check for fingerprints. A diamond that size should hold prints easily."

"Yes, fingerprints!"

"That’s perfect!"

The crowd murmured in agreement.

Evelyn’s friends paled, tugging at her arm. "Enough. You’re making a scene. Let’s go."

Realizing she was only embarrassing herself further, Evelyn shoved the broken necklace into her purse and turned to leave.

"Wait." Isabella’s voice cut through the air like ice.

Evelyn spun around. "What now?"

"You publicly accused our staff of theft without proof. You humiliated her in front of everyone. Don’t you think you owe her an apology?"

"Apologize? To a waitress?" Evelyn laughed sharply. "Your service is terrible, and you expect me to apologize?"

Murmurs of disapproval rippled through the crowd.

"That’s no way for a Vanderbilt to behave," someone muttered.

"She practically had the poor girl on her knees begging!"

"How cruel!"

The waitress stood trembling in the corner, silent tears streaking her cheeks.

"If there was an issue with our service, you could have complained," Isabella said, her gaze unwavering. "But falsely accusing an employee is different. You owe her an apology."

"You want me to apologize to a servant?" Evelyn scoffed. "What kind of manager are you?"

Then—a sudden thud.

The waitress collapsed, her body rigid, eyes rolling back. Foam bubbled at her lips as she convulsed violently.

Gasps filled the room.

Isabella dropped to her knees beside her, loosening the girl’s collar to clear her airway.

"She’s having a seizure! Nathaniel, call an ambulance!"

"Already done. They’re on their way."

A deep, commanding voice made Isabella look up.

Alexander stood behind her, impeccably dressed, his presence commanding the room.

Their eyes locked—a heartbeat of stillness amid the chaos.

"It’s Mr. Kingsley!" someone whispered.

"Brother." Evelyn’s voice wavered.

Alexander’s expression darkened. "Gordon, take Evelyn home. Now."

With the crowd already filming, further scandal was the last thing the Vanderbilt Group needed.

Gordon didn’t hesitate, ushering Evelyn away.

Isabella barely spared them a glance, her focus on the convulsing girl.

"Damn it, she’s biting her tongue!" Nathaniel shouted.

Without thinking, Isabella shoved her wrist between the girl’s teeth.

A sharp pain shot through her as teeth clamped down, but she didn’t flinch.

Alexander stiffened, too late to stop her.

He watched, stunned, as she endured the pain without hesitation—her small frame radiating courage.

For a fleeting moment, he saw someone else.

Paloma.

On the battlefield years ago, she had done the same for him.

"Don’t give up! We’ll make it!"

The memory twisted in his chest.

The ambulance arrived swiftly, and Nathaniel accompanied the waitress to the hospital.

"Miss, your quick action saved her life," a medic told Isabella.

She only smiled faintly. "I just did what anyone would."

Back in the now-quiet lobby, Isabella finally examined her wrist—deep teeth marks, blood welling.

She headed for the medical room.

"Isabella."

Alexander’s voice stopped her.

He was closer than she expected, his presence overwhelming.

She stepped back instinctively, but he caught her arm, pulling her against him.

His chest was solid, unyielding.

"Alexander, control yourself," she said coolly, trying to free herself.

"Where have you been?" His grip tightened. "You vanished. Why?"

"That’s none of your concern."

His jaw clenched. "Come with me."

"Let go," she hissed. "Or I’ll call security."

His eyes darkened.

The thought that she no longer wanted him—that she could walk away—ignited something possessive inside him.

"Even if you call Daniel here," he growled, "he won’t stop me from taking you."
###Chapter 54

Isabella's glare was icy, sharp enough to cut through steel.

"Miss Seraphina must be treating you well, Mr. Nathaniel. You've grown even bolder."

"Don't drag her into this," Nathaniel snapped, irritation flashing in his eyes.

"Stay away if you don't want to hear worse. Other than finalizing the divorce, I want nothing to do with you. Goodbye."

For three years, she had looked at him with hope, her eyes lighting up whenever he appeared. Now, they were empty—lifeless. The sudden shift sent a chill through him, as if he'd been plunged into an abyss of ice.

"I won't let you walk away."

Isabella scoffed. "Because you say so? Do you think I'm some obedient pet?"

"Stop twisting my words. That's not what I meant." His jaw tightened.

"Twisting? Oh, Nathaniel, you're so painfully dense. Can't you recognize sarcasm? Let me spell it out—I despise you. Leave me alone."

Her eyes burned with fury as she tried to wrench her wrist free.

But Nathaniel wasn't one to back down. The harder she fought, the firmer his grip became, ignoring the unspoken rule of treating a lady with care.

A sharp gasp escaped her lips.

She clutched her right arm, a thin sheen of sweat forming on her brow.

Nathaniel froze, realizing his mistake.

Blood stained his palm.

In his haste, he'd forgotten—her wrist was still wounded.

His chest tightened.

"I'm taking you to the infirmary," he said gruffly.

"Get out, or I'm calling the police," she hissed.

"Isabella."

"I said leave!"

Her heart was as scarred as her wrist.

Three years of marriage, and he'd never once held her hand.

Now that they were divorcing, he dared to touch her? Did he think she'd become more tolerable?

The irony was unbearable.

His face paled at her outburst.

"You're telling me to leave? You were the one who insisted on this marriage. Where was this defiance back then?"

"Because I loved you then," she spat, her laughter bitter.

The words struck him like a blade.

His breath hitched.

"When I loved you, you could do whatever you wanted. Now that I don't, you get nothing. Did you really think you could keep reaping the benefits after destroying us? It's over, Nathaniel. You mean nothing to me."

She lifted her chin, turning away without hesitation.

"Do you think I'd be here if it weren't for Grandfather?" His voice was rough. "He hasn't slept in five days. He refuses to eat unless he sees you."

Her fists clenched.

Grandfather was the one person she couldn't ignore.

The one tether still binding them.

She had promised to celebrate his birthday before the divorce.

And she never broke her promises.

Even when it hurt.

"I didn't forget. I'll visit him soon."

"Now."

"What?"

"He's waiting. Come with me."

His patience was fraying, his tone edged with urgency. "Don't disappoint him, Isabella."

In the end, she relented.

She had her reasons for caring for Reginald all those years ago. Back then, she never imagined marrying Nathaniel—she just wanted to be closer to him.

But day by day, she grew to adore the wise old man.

He wasn't just family.

He was her mentor.

Nathaniel followed her to the infirmary. The doctor was out, so she reached for a bandage.

"Let me." His voice was cold as he stepped closer.

She sidestepped. "No."

But Nathaniel was just as stubborn.

He seized her wrist, his grip unyielding. "Behave."

She stiffened as his fingers brushed her skin.

He worked meticulously, his touch surprisingly gentle.

His hands were elegant, veins tracing beneath his skin as he moved.

Some people exuded charm effortlessly.

Nathaniel was one of them.

Her hand was rougher than he expected—soft yet marked by faint calluses.

A strange sense of familiarity prickled at the back of his mind.

Moonlight. Tangled sheets. A fleeting warmth.

He exhaled sharply, pushing the thought away.

He'd never felt this way about Seraphina.

So why did his ex-wife—the woman who infuriated him—stir something so unsettling?

Isabella jerked her hand back. "That's enough."

"Not yet."

His fingers tightened, his smirk cold. "Been working hard? Your hands are rough."

"Cleaning," she lied, knowing how much he hated dirt.

"Isabella."

"I am speaking normally. If you can't understand, that's your problem."

She smirked, her eyes glinting with defiance.

Nathaniel's temper flared.

This woman had become insufferable since gaining independence.

And yet—

He found it intriguing.

He'd never seen this fiery side of her before.

Despite her minor injury, he bandaged it with surprising expertise.

She knew his background—top of his class in military school, a natural strategist.

He could've been a spy.

Or taken Sebastian's place.

But fate had made him the heir to the Vanderbilt empire.

And he'd excelled.

A legend in his own right.

Pity Seraphina had tarnished that legacy.

Isabella's lips curled.

Fine. If he wanted to play games, let him.

She had better things to do.

They reached the parking lot.

As she moved toward her Bugatti, Nathaniel blocked her path.

"Where do you think you're going?"

"To my car."

"You're riding with me."

"No, thanks."

She waved him off, but before she could react, he yanked open his car door, hauled her inside, and slammed it shut.

"Hey! Is this a kidnapping?!" She pounded on the window, furious.

"I don't trust you, Isabella."

He leaned down, his gaze dark.

"You're full of tricks. I'm not taking any chances."
###Chapter 55

The car ride was suffocating.

Isabella sat rigidly beside Alexander, her eyes glued to the passing scenery outside the window, refusing to acknowledge his presence.

He could feel the icy wall between them, her silent rejection cutting deeper than any words.

Alexander stole glances at her profile, his lips parting several times before closing again. The right words never came.

The Kingsley estate in Elmsworth was nestled among rolling hills, a secluded paradise of tranquility.

"Grandfather, I'm here!"

The moment Isabella stepped inside, her entire demeanor transformed. Her smile bloomed like sunshine, her voice as sweet as morning birdsong.

But beneath that radiant facade, her stomach twisted with guilt. The diamond bracelet weighed heavily on her wrist. She had to steel herself before facing him.

"My dear girl! I've missed you terribly!"

Elder Kingsley, seated in his wheelchair, was wheeled out by his butler, Mr. Langley.

His face lit up at the sight of Isabella, wrinkles deepening with joy.

"Where have you been hiding, my dear? Forgotten this old man already? Don't you love me anymore?"

He clasped her hands, firing questions rapid-fire.

Alexander suppressed an eye roll.

His grandfather was a character—age hadn't dulled his playful spirit. If he were younger, he'd probably be running wild with the social elite. Even Alexander's cousin would call him legendary.

"Grandfather, I've been swamped with work and traveling. My apologies. Scold me all you want," Isabella cooed, kneeling gracefully beside him.

"Scold you? Never! Just seeing you brightens my day," Elder Kingsley chuckled, then shot Alexander a pointed look. "If not for a certain troublesome grandson, I could see my dear girl every day without all this fuss!"

Isabella giggled awkwardly.

Alexander clenched his jaw. He should've known better than to come tonight.

"Isabella, I've acquired a new painting—haven't shown anyone yet. Saved it just for you!"

Elder Kingsley eagerly tugged her toward his study.

"Let me guess—you want my expert opinion?" She teased, eyes twinkling.

"Caught me red-handed!"

Alexander watched her, mesmerized.

Three years of marriage, yet he never knew she had so many hidden talents. Racing, calligraphy, tailoring, and now art authentication?

It was hard to believe one person could excel at so much. He needed to see this for himself.

In the study, Mr. Langley had already laid out the painting with gloved hands.

"Isabella, this is my latest acquisition. What do you think?"

"Let's see."

She leaned over the artwork, magnifying glass in hand, posture poised yet relaxed.

Alexander observed her concentration, his usual cold expression softening at the edges.

Outwardly delicate, inwardly a sage—she was fascinating.

Elder Kingsley noticed the bracelet on her wrist. His eyes gleamed knowingly, but his smile remained warm.

"This is undoubtedly the work of a master," Isabella declared confidently.

"Spot on," Elder Kingsley confirmed.

Alexander edged closer, drawn to both the painting and her.

"The brushwork here is distinctive—no records exist to verify authenticity, but the twisted trees are this artist's signature. The strokes are meticulous, the energy vibrant, the colors fresh."

Her analysis was flawless, her expertise undeniable.

Alexander was captivated, his gaze lingering on her profile, intensity burning in his eyes.

"However, Grandfather, I regret to inform you—this is a replica. A skilled imitation, but not the original."

Because the real one hung in her uncle's private collection.

"Oh no! Wrong again!" Elder Kingsley sighed dramatically, pouting like a scolded child.

Isabella glanced up, accidentally meeting Alexander's smoldering stare.

She flinched, quickly lowering her lashes. Her hair curtained half her face, but the faint blush betrayed her.

Alexander's pulse spiked, his breath turning ragged.

Just then, his phone buzzed.

Stepping into the hallway, he answered.

"Alexander, are you still angry with me?"

Victoria's tearful voice crackled through before he could speak.

"I'm not angry," he replied flatly, though she knew better.

"Then come see me? I've missed you so much I can't sleep," she pleaded, saccharine sweet.

"Not tonight. I'm staying with Grandfather."

"You're at the estate? I'll come over! Didn't you say you wanted me to visit more? I made your favorite dessert—the one we used to sneak in that alley as kids. I made some for Grandfather too."

"Victoria, tonight isn't good."

Her mention of their childhood softened him slightly. "Isabella's here. You know how Grandfather adores her. It'd be awkward."

"You're with her right now?" Her voice trembled.

"Yes. Grandfather insisted on seeing her."

"So it's really just for him? Not because you wanted to?" Her tone dripped venom.

"Don't overthink it."

"That woman has no shame! Divorced yet still meddling! She's poisoning Grandfather against me! Using him to control you—how despicable!"

Alexander massaged his temples, exhaling sharply.

Back in the study, Isabella replayed Alexander's heated gaze, her heart fluttering wildly.

Why was she reacting like this? Get a grip!

His eyes were just naturally hypnotic. Probably made everyone feel special!

"Isabella?"

She snapped back to reality. "Yes, Grandfather?"

"You really cherish that bracelet, don't you? Always wearing it."

Her throat tightened.

"Grandfather..."

"Keep it safe. It's precious." He patted her hand. "I had Mr. Langley sort through your grandmother's jewels yesterday. Found pieces perfect for you. Take them home."

His smile turned wistful. "At my age, who knows what tomorrow brings? I once thought Alexander would care for you forever, but..." He sighed. "These will ensure your future comfort."

Isabella's vision blurred.

Elder Kingsley froze—her shoulders shook violently, tears spilling like shattered pearls.

"Grandfather, I'm so sorry."

Guilt crushed her. All those years deceiving him, failing to protect his gift—

She broke down completely.

"Goodness, don't cry!" He fumbled for a handkerchief.

Alexander, lingering outside, heard her sobs.

His ex-wife, usually so composed, wept like a heartbroken child.

Something in his chest fractured. His phone nearly slipped from his grasp.
###Chapter 56

The phone trembled in my hand as Isabella's sobs echoed through the line.

"She knows how strained my relationship with Grandpa is, and she's exploiting it! How heartless can she be?!"

Nathaniel's stunned expression told me everything—he had no idea what I was talking about.

The woman before him was a mess, her face streaked with tears. It wasn't a graceful sight, but the raw pain in her cries hit like a punch to the chest. Every tear felt like a blade twisting deeper.

"Isabella, what the hell is going on? You're scaring Grandpa!" Despite his years of weathering storms, Harrison's voice shook at the sight of her distress.

Isabella's sobs came in ragged bursts. "Grandpa, I—I broke the bracelet. I tried fixing it for days, but it's beyond repair. I thought... maybe I could make a copy so you wouldn't be upset. I lied to you. I'm so sorry."

Her entire body trembled, hands slick with tears.

It was heartbreaking.

Nathaniel stiffened as her broken words registered.

Now he understood—why her fingers had been raw, why she'd been locked away for days. She'd been trying to restore the one thing Grandpa had given her.

The glint of her tears burned him, bitterness spreading through his veins.

"Oh, sweetheart, is that all?"

Harrison squeezed her hand, torn between laughter and tears. "The moment you walked in, I knew you weren't wearing it. I figured something happened. Why else wouldn't you? But I wasn't angry. Your grandmother had boxes of jewelry! I only spun that story so you'd accept it. She used to joke they were a nuisance—said she didn't want them cluttering her afterlife!"

Isabella's tense shoulders eased slightly, but her eyes remained swollen, nose red.

"Nathaniel! Where the hell are you?!"

Harrison smacked the armrest of his wheelchair. "Get over here and comfort your wife!"

Isabella's voice cracked through the phone. "Nate, don't you dare go to her—"

"Later."

The line went dead with a decisive click.

On the other end, Isabella stared at the darkened screen, chest heaving, face twisting in fury.

"Isabella, you conniving witch! You'll pay for this!"

Her fingers flew across the screen, dialing Arabella.

"I need your help! That snake is with Nate at Grandpa's house!"

Her voice was thick with tears. "If this continues, she'll steal him from me! Before, he'd drop everything when I called. Now? He hangs up mid-sentence! Don't you see? If I don't marry into the Kingsley family, I can't help you anymore!"

She knew mere pleading wouldn't work—she had to make Arabella feel the threat.

"Calm down. You know Nathaniel. Pushing him will backfire. That stunt you pulled already damaged your bond. Nostalgia won't last if you keep eroding it." Arabella's tone was chillingly composed.

"Then what do I suggest?"

"Make him pity you. But it has to feel genuine."

A cold laugh. "With me guiding you, does she really think she stands a chance? Over my dead body."

Nathaniel strode into the study.

"Grandpa, I'm here."

"Took you long enough! Can't you hear Isabella crying? Do I need to summon you like a servant?" Harrison snapped.

If it made Isabella happy, Nathaniel could play the fool.

"No."

He approached her, gaze sweeping over her tear-streaked face.

Even in distress, she was breathtaking—like a rose glistening with morning dew. Her dark hair framed her delicate features, enhancing her allure.

Embarrassed, she flushed, a single tear slipping free like a falling star.

Nathaniel's breath hitched, pulse syncing with the flutter of her lashes.

"Apologize to your wife!" Harrison demanded.

"Why me? I didn't make her cry." Nathaniel frowned.

"Because she's your wife! Am I supposed to comfort her while you stand there useless? Use your damn words!"

"Grandpa, we're divorced. I'm not his wife anymore."

"You're bound for life! After three years of neglect, this is the least you owe her!"

The word "divorce" ignited Harrison's temper. "If you don't make this right today, you're no grandson of mine!"

Nathaniel's jaw clenched. Finally, he muttered, "I'm sorry."

Isabella met his gaze, heart stuttering.

This was his first apology to her.

And it rang hollow.

"Bow!" Harrison barked.

"Seriously?"

"Be grateful I'm not making you kneel! I bowed to your grandmother—full sincerity! Isabella is family. You will treat her right. Now, move!"

Harrison had him backed into a corner. With a sharp exhale, Nathaniel stepped back, pressed his palms together, and bent at the waist.

"Isabella, I apologize."

The scene was straight out of a romance novel—the striking couple, the dramatic gesture. Harrison's lips twitched.

Was this happiness?

Isabella's cheeks warmed, her tears slowing. His formal bow, however forced, sent a thrill through her.

She'd be lying if she said it wasn't satisfying.

Just as Nathaniel started to rise—

"Did she say you could stand? Stay bowed until she permits it!"

One second. Two. Three.

She was doing this on purpose.

Only when she caught the vein throbbing in his temple did she sniff. "Grandpa, it's not really his fault. Don't be too hard on him."

Nathaniel's expression darkened.

Isabella.

But seeing her puffy eyes, his anger dissolved.

By dinner, Isabella wheeled Harrison to the dining room, Nathaniel trailing behind.

The table was laden with her favorite dishes—Grandpa's doing.

Yet as they settled in, Gordon rushed in, face grim, leaning to whisper to Nathaniel.

"Out with it," Harrison snapped. "No secrets at my table."

Gordon hesitated.

"Speak," Nathaniel ordered.

"Sir, the Madam called. She knew you were here and didn't want to disturb you, so she contacted me instead."

Harrison's face darkened at the mention of Arabella.

"The Madam said... Ms. Isabella has been diagnosed with severe depression."

Nathaniel's fork clattered to the floor.
###Chapter 57

Isabella felt her heart turn to ice as she watched Alexander lose control over Victoria.

"Ms. Victoria was at home just now, crying your name uncontrollably. Mrs. Sterling is worried she might harm herself and wants you to check on her," Before Gordon could finish, Alexander was already on his feet, storming out of the dining room.

"You ungrateful wretch! If you chase after that woman, you're no grandson of mine!" Reginald slammed his fist on the table.

But it was too late. Alexander's proud figure had already vanished from sight.

"All my efforts over the years couldn't change his mind. I'm powerless!" Reginald clutched his chest in anguish, guilt washing over him as he looked at Isabella.

Isabella forced a small smile, her cold fingers gently covering her grandfather's weathered hand. "Grandfather, don't say that. You've done so much for me. It's just that Alexander and I weren't meant to be."

Outside the villa, Alexander was about to get into his car when a voice stopped him.

"Mr. Kingsley!"

He turned to see Isabella standing under the harsh porch light, her eyes glinting like shards of ice.

A pang of guilt struck him. He opened his mouth to speak, but she beat him to it.

"Your sister verbally assaulted one of my hotel staff tonight, triggering a seizure. Tell her I won't let this go - she needs to apologize."

Alexander frowned. This wasn't what he'd expected.

The hopeful light in his eyes died.

"Evelyn is my sister, but I don't interfere in her personal affairs."

"I see. So personal matters are exempt from accountability." Isabella's lips curled into a frosty smile before she turned on her heel and walked away without another glance.

Alexander felt as if he'd been doused in ice water.

Was she mocking him?

That night, Alexander went to comfort Victoria in her "severe depressive episode." He didn't return until dawn.

Though recent events had created distance between them, seeing her depression diagnosis still tugged at his heartstrings.

Depression was his Achilles' heel.

"Mr. Kingsley, there's an issue. How would you like it handled?" Gordon asked hesitantly, phone in hand.

"What is it?" Alexander massaged his temples.

"The video of your sister berating the hotel waitress has gone viral. PR wants to know how to contain the damage to Kingsley Group's reputation."

"Delete it." Alexander's lips thinned. "Evelyn's personal issues won't tarnish the company. Clean it up."

"Yes, sir!"

Back at the villa, Alexander found Margaret waiting up for him in her nightgown, worry lines creasing her face.

"Margaret, I told you not to wait. I might be out late." A rare warmth flickered in his chest.

Margaret had been like this since his childhood - waiting up like a mother unless explicitly told not to.

But she wasn't getting any younger. For three years, Isabella had taken over this duty, waiting faithfully every night.

"Have you eaten? I kept dinner warm. You really should sleep earlier - these headaches come from overwork. I know you don't want to hear it, but I must say it. I'm just a servant, not family." Margaret sighed bitterly. "If only Isabella were still here... I saw how her flawless complexion dulled caring for you. It breaks my heart. You've thrown away your good fortune."

Alexander's vision blurred as Isabella's bright, wounded eyes surfaced in his mind.

He'd never receive such devotion again. The loss cut deeper than he'd admit.

"Isabella wasn't my fortune - she was my curse."

Alexander stalked to his room, where a familiar tailor's box sat on his desk. Opening it, he found the suit perfectly restored - barely a trace of damage remained.

A satisfied smile tugged at his lips.

"You still have feelings for her, don't you?" Margaret asked softly.

"Fine craftsmanship shouldn't go to waste," Alexander replied coolly, fingers tracing the smooth fabric.

11:25 PM

"Isabella put more than craftsmanship into caring for you."

Margaret sighed heavily. "Come with me."

She led him to Isabella's former room and opened a corner wardrobe. "Look."

The shelves were meticulously organized with color-coded gift boxes.

Alexander froze. "What is this?"

"Every gift Isabella prepared for you over three years. Birthdays, anniversaries, Valentine's Days... even the date you first met. She knew you didn't care, but she poured her heart into each one."

Alexander's chest tightened.

"I can't speak for Ms. Sterling's feelings, but Isabella loved you to the marrow. I never liked that Victoria - all airs and pretenses." Margaret's lips twisted in distaste. "That necklace you gave her? The Sterlings are auctioning it off. After all your effort, they discard it so casually? And Victoria does nothing?"

"Enough, Margaret." Alexander cut her off sharply.

"Do you know how much Isabella coveted that necklace? How she cried when she heard it was for Victoria?" Margaret's voice trembled with indignation.

Alexander stood abruptly, something clenching in his fist.

She'd cried. Over a necklace.

Margaret opened a delicate box, revealing its contents.

Alexander's blood ran cold.

Inside were forgotten fragments of his life - discarded cufflinks, old ties, a retired lighter. She'd treasured what he'd thrown away.

"Isabella would have cherished your gifts, never discarded them thoughtlessly!"

"Victoria didn't know about the auction. She'd have stopped it." Alexander's fists clenched, bitterness flooding his mouth.

He didn't know who he was defending anymore.

"You can't wake someone pretending to sleep." Margaret shook her head sadly and left.

Alexander stood alone, emotions churning.

Those three years of wifely perfection had been an act. She'd had temper, cared deeply, burned with jealousy.

She'd simply swallowed every hurt.

Where had that passionate woman gone? Why couldn't he find her in those indifferent eyes now?

Alexander gritted his teeth, resentment twisting his features.
###Chapter 58

The golden morning light spilled through the curtains, warm and inviting.

Isabella stretched lazily in her plush bed, arching her back like a contented feline. The silk sheets slid off her toned frame as she rose, her movements graceful yet effortless.

She slipped into a crisp white athleisure set and made her way to the private lake behind the estate. The water shimmered under the early sun, calling to her.

Daniel was already there, impeccably dressed as always. In one hand, he held a chilled bottle of water, in the other, a fresh towel. His sharp eyes tracked her approach, unwavering.

"Gone. Every last clip of Victoria berating our staff has vanished from the internet. Searched every keyword—nothing."

He handed her the towel, then twisted the cap off the water bottle. "There's still some murmuring online, but it'll fade. Doubt it'll escalate."

"Of course. The Vanderbilt PR and legal teams are the best in New York. And Alexander has them wrapped around his finger." Isabella dabbed the sweat from her brow, her breathing steady but quick.

"So, Alexander had them removed?" Daniel's brows lifted slightly.

Isabella shook her damp hair, tilting her head back to drink. The sunlight caught the curve of her throat, the motion elegant yet unintentionally mesmerizing.

Daniel swallowed hard.

"Profit first, damage control second. That's Alexander now."

She wiped her lips with the back of her hand, smirking. "Had I met him in a boardroom first, I'd never have fallen for that man."

Fallen at the wrong time, for the wrong man.

"So, what's your play?"

Isabella's eyes gleamed with quiet cunning. She always had a plan.

"That girl hasn't been discharged yet, right? We'll start with a meeting at the hotel, then you'll take me to the hospital. Time to check on our guest."

Hours later, at Royal Grace Hospital.

The girl had been moved to a standard ward. When she saw Isabella walk in, she jolted upright, panic flashing across her face.

Isabella strode forward, pressing a gentle hand to her shoulder. "Lie down, Audrey. Rest. You need it."

"Manager Sinclair, I—I'm so sorry for the trouble!"

Audrey's voice trembled. "I didn't know I'd collapse like that. I swear I wasn't hiding anything. I just... I messed up."

"I saw your records. This was your first episode. No history of it before. You didn't hide anything, so stop blaming yourself." Isabella smiled softly.

"Please, deduct the hospital fees from my salary!"

"Not happening. This was work-related. The hotel covers it."

Audrey's eyes welled up. "Thank you."

"I came to ask you something."

Isabella's expression shifted, her voice dropping to a firm murmur. "What do you want to do about Victoria?"

Audrey's shoulders slumped. "Victoria's a Vanderbilt. I'm nobody. No power, no influence. What can I do?"

She swallowed hard. "And this morning, I saw all the videos were gone. Even my voice online... silenced."

"If the Vanderbilts won't give you a voice, I will."

Isabella leaned in, her gaze unyielding. Every word deliberate.

Audrey's eyes widened. "You... will?"

"If you want Victoria to apologize, we take this public. But it'll affect your life. So I need your consent. You're the one who suffered. I won't bulldoze over your feelings."

"I want her to say sorry. Even if it's just to my face."

"No. We go public." Isabella never minced words.

Audrey gasped. "Public?! That's impossible!"

"Audrey, Victoria will never apologize privately." Daniel interjected quietly. "She humiliated you in front of dozens. The only way she'll bend is if we force her into the spotlight."

"Please, just drop it! I don't want to cause more problems for you or the hotel!" Audrey shook her head frantically.

"Don't be afraid. If Victoria retaliates, she's signing her own downfall. And I have my reasons for this."

A spark of something dangerous flickered in Isabella's eyes. "If you agree, leave it to me. I don't let my people suffer in silence."

Victoria thought this would blow over.

She was wrong.

Isabella could walk away from a marriage.

But she would never walk away from a fight.

Outside the ward, Isabella slid her sunglasses on, shielding the fire in her gaze.

Then she dialed Julian.

"Isabella! Finally remembered I exist!"

His voice was a mix of mock hurt and theatrics. "You have no idea how much grief I got from Oliver! He said you forgot about me—I almost cried!"

"You two are my brothers, not my harem. Stop being dramatic." She sighed. "Listen, I need a favor."

"A favor? Oh no, we're strangers now! So cold, so distant!" Julian wailed. "Next thing I know, you'll forget my face entirely!"

"Julian. Focus. I need your help." Isabella gritted her teeth as passing nurses shot her odd looks.

"There we go. That's the Isabella I know." He chuckled. "What do you need?"

Her voice turned razor-sharp. "I'm dropping a video tomorrow. I need you to make sure it can't be taken down."

"How long do you want it up?"

"Long enough for the message to stick."

"Done. But you owe me." His tone turned sly.

"Name it."

"I want a free pass to punch Alexander in the face. Deal?"

A muscle in her jaw twitched.

"Go to hell."

The next day, Vanderbilt Industries.

Alexander sat at the head of the conference table, his presence glacial. The room was silent, every executive rigid under his scrutiny.

"We need the Astoria deal closed by Friday. No excuses."

Mid-sentence, murmurs erupted. Phones buzzed. One by one, the board members paled.

Alexander's phone vibrated.

He glanced at the screen.

Then his expression turned murderous.

Back in his office, he faced Gordon, his voice lethal. "I told you to erase every trace of Victoria's video. Why is it trending again?"

"It appeared out of nowhere this morning! PR didn't even get a warning!" Gordon stammered. "We're trying to take it down, but—it's stuck!"

"Stuck?" Alexander's knuckles whitened. "You have thirty minutes. I want Victoria's name off that list."

Anything threatening the Vanderbilts died. Immediately.

"Sir—look at this!"

Gordon shoved his phone forward, face ashen.

The new top trend: Hotel Heroine Saves Staff.

Alexander clicked it.

Then his blood ran cold.

The video showed Isabella rescuing a waitress.

Every second captured.

Including her face.

His ex-wife's identity was out.

And the world was watching.
###Chapter 59

The air in the executive office of The Regal Palace was thick with tension.

Isabella Sinclair stood before the floor-to-ceiling window, her hands clasped behind her back. Her poised silhouette exuded an unshakable authority, one that demanded respect without question.

"Who authorized the release of that video?"

"You said you needed something to spark public discourse," Nathan Prescott replied, his expression darkening.

"Nathan, as my secretary—and someone who has known me since childhood—you should understand what I despise most."

Isabella turned her head slowly, her piercing gaze locking onto him. "You thought you were helping, but you acted without my consent. I see right through you. You wanted to use this to elevate my public image while tearing down Victoria Sterling."

With every word, Nathan’s shoulders slumped further. Each syllable struck like a blade.

"But let me make one thing clear—I don’t need it."

Her voice turned glacial. "I do what I do because it’s right. Even if I detest Victoria, I won’t resort to cheap theatrics to humiliate her. The moment a good deed becomes a spectacle for public judgment, it loses its meaning entirely."

"I was wrong. I only wanted—"

"Your intentions don’t matter."

Isabella reached for her phone, her expression unreadable. "I’m calling Alexander Kingsley. You’re being reassigned. Your methods don’t align with mine."

"No!"

Nathan paled, his hand shooting out to grasp her wrist. "Miss Sinclair, punish me however you see fit—make me scrub toilets, wash dishes, dock my pay! But don’t send me away. Please."

A flicker of surprise crossed Isabella’s face at the desperation in his eyes.

Nathan came from a distinguished legal family—his father a senior judge, his mother a renowned attorney, his brothers pillars of the judicial system. Though not as wealthy as the elite, his upbringing had been privileged.

Yet for the Sinclair Group—for her—he had willingly stepped down to serve as her secretary.

Her resolve softened slightly. "This is your last warning. Don’t overstep again."

"Thank you! I swear I won’t act without your approval!" Relief flooded his features, his eyes shimmering.

"Release my hand. Remember your place." Her lips curved faintly.

Nathan jolted, realizing he still held her wrist. Heat rushed to his face as he withdrew, his palm tingling with the lingering warmth of her skin.

"About the trending video—"

"I’ll have Daniel Carter handle it. You’re coming with me."

She selected a tailored blazer, and Nathan immediately moved to assist her, draping it over her shoulders with practiced ease.

"We’re paying Victoria a visit."

Victoria Sterling was fuming.

"Mother, what am I supposed to do now?" she snapped into her phone. "I just got out of the last scandal, and that country bumpkin is dragging me back in! She’s doing this on purpose!"

"Have you lost your mind? Do you even realize how you escaped the last scandal? And now you’re gloating?" Elspeth’s voice was sharp.

Victoria massaged her temples. Of course she wasn’t as foolish as her mother implied—but Isabella’s sudden resurgence had rattled her.

"So what’s the plan? This negative press is ruining me! Her heroic act makes me look like a villain. Am I just supposed to let her overshadow me?"

"Your father has already spoken. No public statements, no apologies. Stay silent." Elspeth’s tone lowered. "And don’t worry—Sebastian will handle it. He won’t let the company’s reputation suffer. Just keep your head down."

Somewhat reassured, Victoria hung up and returned to browsing Moonlit Treasures with her friends.

Then the Rolls-Royce pulled up outside.

Dressed in an impeccably tailored sapphire suit, Isabella strode in with Nathan at her side. Her presence commanded immediate attention—every head turned.

"Miss, how may I assist you?" A sales associate approached, momentarily forgetting Nathan in Isabella’s radiant aura.

"Fetch your boss, Victoria. I require her personal service." Isabella’s tone left no room for negotiation.

The associate hesitated.

"I know she’s upstairs. If she keeps me waiting, she’ll regret it."

"May I ask your name?"

A faint smile. "Tell her Ms. Sinclair is here."

Victoria’s face twisted in fury when she heard.

"Isabella Sinclair! How dare she show her face here?"

Her friends egged her on. "She’s the one who released that video! This is your chance to put her in her place!"

"Yeah, teach her a lesson! We’ve got your back!"

Fueled by their encouragement, Victoria stormed downstairs, her entourage in tow.

"Isabella! You shameless gold-digger! How dare you come here?"

Isabella sat composedly, her legs crossed elegantly beneath her trousers. She sipped English tea with the ease of someone in her own parlor.

"Is this how you treat customers, Miss Sterling? No wonder your reputation is in shambles."

"Customer? You’re nothing but a social climber trying to leech off Sebastian and steal the Kingsley fortune!" Victoria jabbed a manicured finger toward Isabella’s face.

The few remaining staff exchanged uneasy glances.

Isabella Sinclair? A gold-digger? The woman radiated wealth—from her designer suit to the rare Twilight pendant glinting at her throat.

"Let’s cut to the chase. I didn’t come to shop. Your merchandise is… underwhelming." Isabella set her cup down with deliberate calm.

Victoria’s retort died in her throat as her eyes caught on the pendant.

"My demand is simple." Isabella didn’t even look at her. "You will hold a press conference and publicly apologize to the hotel employee you assaulted—the one currently hospitalized because of you."
###Chapter 60

"Did you hear that?" Glynnis burst into laughter, clutching her stomach. "This girl actually expects me to apologize to some waiter. Are you serious? Did you even think before you spoke?"

Her two friends joined in, their laughter echoing through the room.

I remained silent.

"I'm spending my money here. The service is terrible, and when I complain, you get offended? And now you have the nerve to demand an apology?" She scoffed. "Who do you think you are? Do you own this place?"

Jason narrowed his eyes. If only they knew—every K Hotel in the country belonged to Ms. Sinclair. They wouldn’t dare utter another word.

"Aren’t you worried about tarnishing the Abernathy name?" Evadne’s voice was icy. "Or embarrassing the family?"

Glynnis rolled her eyes. "Please. I’m not the CEO. Why should I care?"

She crossed her arms. "Besides, that’s Thaddeus’ job. Father put him in charge—he should be handling these things. What else is he good for?"

The staff around them gasped.

Evadne smirked. This family was a mess—all smiles on the surface, but knives behind their backs.

Glynnis despised Thaddeus. To her, he was just a tool, an illegitimate son they tolerated.

Evadne had seen through them the moment she married into the family. If not for her love for Thaddeus, she would’ve walked away long ago.

"Miss Abernathy," Evadne said coolly, "even if you don’t care about the family’s reputation, you should care about your own."

Glynnis scoffed. "Don’t threaten me! Just because you have the Ashbournes backing you doesn’t mean I’m scared. The Abernathys aren’t pushovers!" She snapped her fingers. "Security! Get this nobody out of here!"

Two guards moved toward Evadne.

She didn’t flinch.

Jason sprang into action, kicking one guard back with ease. His black belt in Taekwondo made quick work of them.

Glynnis paled. The female staff, however, blushed—he was undeniably handsome.

"If you refuse to apologize," Evadne said, pulling out her phone, "I’ll have to take matters into my own hands."

Glynnis hesitated but stepped forward, pride forcing her to face Evadne.

The moment she saw the screen, her face drained of color.

Explicit photos—her with two male models, compromising positions, everything.

Her hands trembled. She’d made sure those were deleted!

"Apologize publicly," Evadne said, "and I’ll delete them. Refuse, and you know what happens."

Glynnis’ lips quivered. Elspeth had groomed her to marry into wealth—if these got out, her reputation would be ruined.

In a desperate move, she lunged for the phone.

Evadne dodged effortlessly. Glynnis stumbled onto the sofa, then swung her hand—

SMACK!

The sharp sound silenced the room.

Glynnis hit the floor, a red handprint blazing across her cheek.

Jason smirked. No one touched his boss and walked away.

The two friends backed away, terrified.

"You—you hit me?!" Glynnis shrieked.

"Should I wait for you to bite me?" Evadne dusted her hands off.

Glynnis’ face burned with rage.

Then—the doors swung open.

A cold presence filled the room.

Thaddeus stood there, tall and imposing, his gaze locking onto Evadne’s.

For a second, surprise flickered between them. Then Evadne looked away, indifferent.

His chest tightened.

"Thaddeus!" Glynnis wailed, scrambling to him. "She hit me! You have to do something!"

"I did." Evadne smirked. "The mark’s still fresh."

Thaddeus’ voice was frosty. "What are you doing here?"

"You tell me."

Once, her eyes had sparkled for him. Now, they were empty.

The ache in his chest deepened.

Glynnis sobbed dramatically. "She’s blackmailing me! She wants me to apologize to some staff—or she’ll leak photos!"

Thaddeus’ jaw clenched. "Evadne. You’ve already humiliated us online. Isn’t that enough?"

Jason bristled, but Evadne held him back.

Thaddeus’ anger flared at the protective gesture.

"I’m not greedy," she said coldly. "I’m just demanding what’s right."

"Right?" He scoffed. "Or helping Cassius?"

"Then we’re done here." She turned to leave.

"Wait!" Glynnis panicked. "Thaddeus, she has photos! You can’t let her go!"

Thaddeus moved swiftly, snatching Evadne’s phone.

Glynnis grinned. Just like Elspeth said—he’d always side with her.

"Give it back!" Evadne lunged, but her heel caught. She crashed into him.

His arms wrapped around her waist instinctively.

Her face burned, but her fingers traced the hard planes of his chest through his shirt.

Damn. Perfect.

Thaddeus ignored her, unlocking her phone.

He remembered.

The screen lit up.
###Chapter 61

"You little thief! Give that back to me right now!"

Isabella Sinclair's cheeks burned crimson as her petite frame pressed against Alexander Kingsley's muscular physique beneath his tailored suit. Her fingers dug into his broad shoulders for balance while she squirmed like a trapped wildcat. His powerful arm locked around her waist in an unbreakable grip.

Her pulse skyrocketed at the possessive intensity of his hold. Through the thin fabric of her dress, she could feel the searing heat of his palm against her skin.

Yet Alexander remained fixated on her phone screen, his expression unreadable as he scrolled through the contents.

The entire room held its breath. Who dared speak to Mr. Kingsley like this? And why wasn't he furious?

Nathaniel Prescott wiped his brow, desperate to intervene but paralyzed by uncertainty.

Vanessa Sterling gaped in shock. They'd never been this physically close during their marriage. Why were they practically glued together after divorce?

Two socialites nearby nearly chewed through their freshly manicured nails, green with envy at Isabella's intimate contact with the most powerful bachelor in New York.

Alexander's brow furrowed as he swiftly deleted every compromising photo of Vanessa. "Isabella," he said icily, slipping the phone back into her pocket before releasing her, "how desperate have you become to resort to such cheap tricks?"

She stumbled back, brushing imaginary dirt from her dress with visible disgust. "Oh please, if we're talking about cheap tactics, you're the grandmaster." Her eyes flashed with contempt. "At least I fight fair. You just resort to brute force when you can't win. How utterly primitive - are you auditioning for King Kong?"

The crowd erupted in nervous laughter. Alexander's jaw clenched so tight it could crack diamonds. She'd just compared him to a gorilla in front of Manhattan's elite. But what burned worse than the insult was the sheer revulsion in her gaze.

Just how much did she despise him?

Since their divorce, she'd been the one constantly provoking him. He'd shown remarkable restraint, yet she kept pushing. Enough.

Alexander advanced suddenly, looming over her with glacial intensity. "Do you think our failed marriage gives you license to disrespect me?" he growled, voice low enough that only she could hear. "Not even Evelyn would dare speak to me this way. What makes you so bold?"

The barb struck deep. Isabella had never regretted loving Alexander or being his wife, even during those three years when he'd barely glanced her way. His indifference had chipped away at her self-worth daily.

Now she wished she could erase those years entirely.

Forcing down the ache in her chest, she met his gaze defiantly. "Evelyn tolerates your arrogance because she cares. You mean nothing to me now."

Alexander's eyes darkened dangerously. In the next heartbeat, Isabella fisted his silk tie, yanking him down to her level. "Did you expect gratitude for that sham marriage?" she hissed. "Let me make this clear - I'd rather have spent those years in prison."

Their faces were inches apart, the air between them crackling with hostility. Alexander's throat constricted against the tie's pressure, but the real pain came from her words - each one sharper than the last.

"Those three years were a waking nightmare. You think being Mrs. Kingsley was some grand privilege? A badge of honor?" She released him with a shove. "If I could erase you from my life completely, I would. Better yet - I wish I'd never loved you at all."

Alexander recoiled as if struck. His chest constricted violently, breath coming in short gasps. By the time he regained his composure, Isabella was already striding away. Nathaniel shot him a venomous glare before following - he might not have heard the exchange, but he recognized cruelty when he saw it.

"Did you delete those awful photos?" Vanessa trilled, rushing forward to cling to Alexander's arm. "That provincial nobody actually threatened me! Thank goodness you intervened before she could tarnish the Kingsley name."

But Alexander remained trapped in the wreckage of his ex-wife's words. His glare could have frozen hell over as he turned to Vanessa. "Were the photos authentic?"

Vanessa blinked. "Excuse me?"

"If they were fake," Alexander said coldly, "how could Isabella have used them against you?"

Vanessa's mouth opened and closed like a fish. This wasn't the reaction she'd expected. Was he... defending Isabella?

"I saw everything that night perfectly clearly," Alexander continued, his voice like shards of ice. "Given the situation's severity, you'll hold a press conference tomorrow to publicly apologize to that hotel employee."

"What?!" Vanessa's face twisted in outrage. "Absolutely not! I was a paying guest at their establishment! Their negligent service ruined my necklace! They should be apologizing to me!"

Suddenly, the second-floor display screen flickered to life without warning. Security footage began playing, instantly capturing the room's attention.

The video showed two glamorous women preening in a hotel elevator, their designer outfits and smug expressions unmistakable - Vanessa's so-called best friends.

"-God, can you believe Vanessa's behavior? One expensive necklace and she acts like the Queen of England."
"-If she didn't bankroll our shopping sprees, no one would tolerate her."
"-Think she's realized we're the ones who broke her precious necklace?"
"-We hid it under the bed. Let her turn the place upside down - serves her right for being so insufferable."

As the footage ended, both women went sheet-white.

Vanessa's shriek could have shattered crystal. She advanced on them like an avenging fury, heels clicking ominously against marble.

"Wait! This isn't what it looks like!" they stammered, backing away in panic. "We were set up!"

"You backstabbing vipers!" Vanessa lunged, all pretense of elegance abandoned. "After everything I've done for you!"

The ensuing catfight would be talked about for weeks.
###Chapter 62

Isabella Sinclair slammed the car door shut, her entire body radiating tension. She felt like a malfunctioning machine, every gear grinding against the next.

Each time Thaddeus Kingsley's cruel words replayed in her mind, it was like being doused in ice water. How had she never noticed how vicious he could be? How utterly shameless?

Love might not guarantee happiness, but one thing was certain—it could turn you blind.

"Miss Sinclair, I posted the video like you asked. Look, Glynnis and her little minions are tearing each other apart!" Jason Carter shoved his phone in front of her.

Isabella glanced at the screen where three women were engaged in a vicious brawl, hair-pulling and all.

"Damn, that girl's got claws. Holding her own against two? She should join the wrestling circuit," Jason chuckled.

"Please. It's just hair-pulling and slapping. Nothing impressive."

Despite her words, Isabella kept watching. The petty drama was oddly satisfying.

"Miss Sinclair… did Thaddeus really delete all the photos?"

Jason remembered the way Thaddeus had once held Isabella’s waist—flirtatious, possessive. The memory made his blood boil. But then he remembered their three-year marriage. There must have been far more intimate moments. He had no right to be angry.

"He deleted them. Even if he despises Glynnis, he still has to protect the Kingsley Group’s reputation. Call it ‘thinking big picture.’ Or call him a heartless bastard who doesn’t care about family."

Isabella sighed and unlocked her phone. She hadn’t expected Thaddeus to remember her passcode. Maybe he’d seen it once and never forgotten.

But what did it matter? The man who never loved her would never understand what "0923" meant.

Thirteen years ago—the day he rescued her from that mountain. To him, it was just another forgettable moment.

"Miss Sinclair, what now? Thaddeus destroyed our evidence. Glynnis won’t back down," Jason asked, frowning.

Isabella suddenly gasped. Thaddeus’ number was now saved in her contacts. No matter how careful she was, he always outmaneuvered her.

That night, Thaddeus returned to Windermere Estate in the pouring rain.

Drops slid down the car window like tears. He thought of Isabella’s eyes—bright as stars, but filled with resentment.

His mood darkened further.

Leaning back, neon lights traced his sharp jawline, adding an air of mystery to his stern expression. He adjusted his tie, its smooth silk reminding him of her slender waist.

His throat tightened.

Isabella had grown bold. During their marriage, she wouldn’t even touch him. Now? She provoked him in public.

Did she think he was a joke?

"Mr. Kingsley…" Gordon Bennett hesitated.

"Speak." Thaddeus’ tone was ice.

"The Glynnis incident is spiraling. The internet’s crucifying her. Should we—"

"Leave it."

"But if we don’t act, Mr. Frederic might summon you."

Thaddeus scoffed. "I’m not scared. Why are you?"

His phone buzzed. Gordon checked it. "The surveillance footage you requested is ready."

Thaddeus took the phone. The video showed Glynnis’ confrontation with Isabella—her arrogance, her attempt to strike, and Isabella’s retaliation.

His expression darkened.

This wasn’t just anger. This was fury.

Thaddeus had barely changed when Frederic summoned him to the study.

"Dad! You have to defend me! Look what she did to me!" Glynnis sobbed, her face scratched, her lip split.

Frederic stroked her hair. "When Thaddeus gets here, we’ll sort this out."

Elspeth Kingsley wrung her hands. "The scandal’s spreading. How will our daughter face society now?"

Frederic’s eyes hardened. "She won’t be humiliated."

The door opened. Thaddeus walked in, expressionless.

"Thaddeus! You’re the CEO, and you’re ignoring this mess?" Frederic snapped.

"The PR and legal teams handle scandals. I don’t micromanage."

Elspeth clutched her chest. "She’s your sister! Are you fine with her reputation ruined?"

Frederic comforted her, his gaze tender.

Twenty years, and their sickening displays still made Thaddeus nauseous. His father had erased his birth mother like she never existed.

"I’m fine, darling," Elspeth whispered. "Thaddeus is busy. Maybe… he resents me. I’m not his real mother."

Thaddeus watched, bored. How had Frederic not grown tired of this act?

"Don’t be ridiculous. You’re his mother!" Frederic glared at Thaddeus. "Fix this. By morning, those videos disappear. Or else."

"I already gave Glynnis a solution."

"Dad! His ‘solution’ is for me to apologize to that nobody!" Glynnis wailed. "And today, Isabella slapped me in public!"

Elspeth gasped. "She what?!"

"Look at my face! Would I lie?"

"That woman is a demon!" Elspeth snarled. "I’ll sue her!"

"Glynnis hit her first. She defended herself," Thaddeus said flatly.

Frederic’s eyes darkened. "So she did strike Glynnis?"

Thaddeus nodded.

"Call her. Demand an apology. And finalize that divorce tomorrow. No more contact."

Thaddeus’ jaw tightened. He wanted the divorce—but hearing the order made his skin crawl.

"No."
###Chapter 63

"No way?!"

Glynnis and her mother froze in shock, one forgetting her rage, the other her tears.

"Thaddeus! You're defying me!" Frederic's face darkened with fury, his blood pressure spiking.

This illegitimate son, who had barely resisted him his entire life, now dared to refuse him as CEO?

Even Thaddeus was surprised by his own firmness.

"What the hell is wrong with you? You were the one who wanted to divorce her in the first place! You insisted on marrying Acacia! Now I'm ordering you to end this farce, and you're refusing? Do you think marriage is some kind of joke?!"

"A joke?" Thaddeus smirked, his voice laced with bitterness. "Maybe. Like father, like son."

"You ungrateful brat!" Frederic stormed forward and struck him hard across the face. The sharp crack echoed through the study, making Glynnis flinch.

A red handprint bloomed on Thaddeus' cheek.

"Frederic, please! We can talk this through!" Elspeth rushed to his side, feigning concern while secretly relishing the scene. "Thaddeus is young and impulsive. Hitting him only drives a wedge between you!"

"Elspeth, you've always coddled him too much. That's why he turned out like this!" Frederic's palm stung, his face flushed with anger.

"I just wanted to be a good mother to him," Elspeth sniffled, her voice trembling. "He never truly accepted me, so I had to be extra kind..."

Every word dripped with false sincerity, each one stoking Frederic's rage further.

Thaddeus watched coldly. He'd seen through her act since childhood. If not for his older brother's illness, he'd never have been given this position.

Some children could cry all they wanted—no one would care.

"Thirty years old, and still acting like a child!" Frederic jabbed a finger at him. "Two things. First, divorce her immediately and make her apologize to Glynnis. Second, clean up this mess online!"

Thaddeus' lips curled into a chilling smile. "Is this how you negotiate, Father? Slap first, demand later?"

"What did you say?!"

"Even between father and son, business is business. I won’t divorce her yet—I promised Grandfather I'd wait until after his birthday. As for the scandal, Glynnis will apologize publicly. That’s my final offer."

"Thaddeus—!" Frederic raised his hand again, but this time, Thaddeus caught his wrist mid-air.

"Thirty years old, Father. You can’t hit me anymore." His grip was ironclad, his gaze icy.

Frederic's pupils contracted, pain shooting through his wrist.

"No! I won’t apologize!" Glynnis shrieked, her face twisted in defiance.

"Gordon," Thaddeus called sharply. His assistant entered immediately, bowing.

"Show him the documents."

Gordon hesitated but complied, handing Frederic a thick file.

"What is this?"

"Moonlit Treasures' financial reports for the past three years." Thaddeus' voice was calm, detached. "Managed by Elspeth and Glynnis. Ten million in losses annually, all covered by company funds."

Elspeth paled. Glynnis' mouth fell open.

"If Glynnis refuses to apologize," Thaddeus continued coolly, "I'll shut down Moonlit Treasures as CEO."

Shut it down?!

Elspeth's eyes burned with hatred. She clutched Frederic's arm, tears streaming. "Darling, you gave me that boutique! You can’t let him—!"

Frederic's jaw clenched. The evidence was undeniable.

"I’ll overlook this—on one condition. Glynnis apologizes publicly, and Elspeth repays the misused funds. Otherwise, I’ll expose everything at the board meeting." His tone left no room for argument.

Elspeth seethed. She couldn’t lose Moonlit Treasures—not when she had bigger plans.

"Glynnis," Frederic said through gritted teeth, "you’ll hold a press conference tomorrow."

Defeated, Glynnis slumped like a deflated balloon.

As Thaddeus left, the sound of shattering glass and wailing followed him.

Gordon frowned. "Sir, why back down now? We worked hard for this leverage."

"Because it’s enough."

An image of na flashed in his mind—her bright eyes, the warmth of her breath. He shook his head.

He told himself it was the surveillance footage, Glynnis' arrogance, that changed his mind.

But was that really all?

Why had he reacted so fiercely when they insulted her?

"Still, it feels wasteful," Gordon muttered.

"Doesn’t matter. Frederic would cover for them anyway." Thaddeus exhaled, forcing her face from his thoughts. "This is just... repayment. I owe her that much."

His chest ached faintly.

A debt he refused to carry.
###Chapter 64

Isabella Sinclair spent the entire night tossing in bed, her mind refusing to quiet down. Each time she shut her eyes, Alexander Kingsley's striking features invaded her thoughts, making her pulse quicken and her skin burn. The memory of his strong hands gripping her waist sent an electric current through her body, leaving her restless and agitated.

She bolted upright, sheets clinging to her damp skin, her breathing uneven. They were divorced, yet Alexander was the only man who could still make her feel this way.

After barely two hours of sleep, she dragged herself out of bed and paddled a kayak across the lake at dawn, hoping the rhythmic motion would steady her nerves.

Breakfast was prepared by Olivia Bennett.

Isabella stabbed her toast with unnecessary force, chewing mechanically as she downed her coffee in one gulp.

"Troubled about Victoria Sterling, Ms. Sinclair?" Olivia dabbed at Isabella's fingers with a napkin, ever the picture of grace.

"I hate losing," Isabella muttered, eyes shut tight. What she really despised was being under Alexander's control—even now.

"And the situation with Gabrielle Moreau?"

"Give me time. We need to act before the media frenzy dies down." Her phone buzzed on the table. William Sinclair.

"Father?" Her grip tightened around the device.

"Relax, I'm not calling with bad news." His chuckle was warm. "Your aunts want to throw you a celebration."

"A celebration?" She frowned.

"You're trending everywhere as 'New York's Guardian Angel.' They're bursting with pride."

Isabella cringed at the nickname.

"They miss you. Come home for dinner."

She exhaled sharply. "I'm trying to lay low. This attention is dangerous."

"Ungrateful child." His tone softened. "Just one meal. It's been too long."

"Fine. Once I've handled my affairs." She relented.

His voice turned serious. "Is that troublemaker Nathaniel Hawthorne back in town?"

"Yes."

"Tch. If he weren't your brother's friend..." William's anger crackled through the line. "Bring him with you. If he refuses, consider himself disowned."

The call ended, leaving Isabella massaging her temples. She snatched a chocolate bar from Olivia's pocket and took an aggressive bite.

"Problem, Miss Sinclair?"

"Father insists I bring Nathaniel to dinner."

Olivia winced. Nathaniel's explosive temper was legendary.

"Those two in a room together is a disaster waiting to happen."

Isabella savored the chocolate, the sugar calming her nerves. "Nathaniel listens to me about everything except this. I'll need to be creative."

At the hotel, her Bugatti was met by a swarm of paparazzi. Isabella's jaw tightened as Olivia called security.

"They're here for the 'Guardian Angel.' Somehow they traced her to our staff."

Isabella's eyes darkened. "Don't they have real news to cover?"

She sighed. "This hype will fade. My brother's already suppressing the stories. Use the service entrance."

Scrolling through the hotel's Twitter feed in the elevator, she noted the flood of positive engagement from the viral incident.

"K Group's staff training is impeccable! Definitely booking here next time!"

"That woman was stunning—any clearer photos?"

"K Group stands by their people, unlike Vanderbilt Industries. When will they address their bullying scandal?"

A smirk tugged at her lips. The free publicity was undeniable, but the unresolved Victoria situation still gnawed at her.

Suddenly, the hairs on her neck stood up. Someone was too close. A hand landed on her shoulder.

Reacting instantly, she flung her coffee in the intruder's face.

"Jesus Christ—!"

In one fluid motion, she grabbed his arm and flipped him onto the marble floor with a sickening thud.

"Bloody hell—!"

The muscular man groaned beneath her.

"Dominic?!" She gasped, recognizing Alexander's best friend.

"Christ, Sinclair..." He coughed, wiping coffee from his eyes. "A beautiful woman's touch is like honey on a blade—sweet but deadly."

"Why sneak up on me? That was reflex!" Embarrassed, she knelt to check his injuries, her trained hands moving with clinical precision.

Dominic watched her through half-lidded eyes, thinking, 'Kingsley, you fool. Letting this goddess slip through your fingers.'

"No fractures. You'll live." She patted his leg. "Don't expect an apology."

"I would stand if I could." He winced dramatically. "Everything's numb. Help me up?"

Rolling her eyes, she hauled him upright. When he swayed into her, his heartbeat stuttered. Women usually threw themselves at him—this was new.

"So, Sinclair," he murmured, leaning closer. "How'd our little collision feel?"

"Like I should've checked you for brain damage." She scoffed. "Unless you've got a third eye, you're just another man. And I've known better."

The moment the words left her mouth, she flushed. The image of Alexander's sweat-slicked torso and the way he'd moved against her that single, unforgettable night flashed behind her eyelids.

Dominic's smile turned predatory. He pinned her against the wall, his gaze dropping to her lips. "Better than Kingsley?" His voice deepened. "You've only sampled one flavor, darling. How do you know I'm not an upgrade?"

The tension between them crackled like live wires.
###Chapter 65

Jareth was, without a doubt, a master at charming women.

"Hmph, are you seriously asking for another beating?" Evadne shot back, her teeth clenched. Her icy gaze burned with lethal intensity.

Jareth wisely took two steps back, raising his hands in surrender. "Easy there, Ms. Evadne. Just a joke. No need to get violent. Besides, I’m the one who got hit, yelled at, and now my clothes are ruined. I have lunch with my mother later—if she sees me like this, she’ll freak out. So, how about helping me change?"

Evadne exhaled sharply. Maybe she had gone too far. Compared to the shallow Thaddeus, Jareth was at least reasonable. He’d defended her when Acacia tried to humiliate her. She remembered that.

"I’ll have my secretary get you a new outfit and arrange a private suite for you to freshen up. Will that work?" Her tone was cool but not unkind.

"Too much hassle," Jareth countered smoothly. "There’s a department store nearby. Why don’t you come with me to pick something out? Your secretary might not have the best taste." His lips curved into a smirk. "And I’d love for you to choose something for me."

Evadne considered it. Broad daylight, public place—what could he possibly try? "Fine."

She drove.

Her speed left Jareth gripping the seat, his pulse racing faster than the car. What should’ve been a twenty-minute trip took ten.

Jareth gaped. "You drive like a pro."

"Used to drive a taxi before I met Thaddeus." She unbuckled her seatbelt. "Out. I don’t have time to waste."

Jareth, an underground racing legend himself, recognized skill when he saw it. This woman was not ordinary. His interest deepened.

The mall was quiet on a Monday, but their striking presence still turned heads.

"You’ve been trending online lately," Jareth mused. "Showing up with me might stir more gossip."

Evadne ignored him. "You like YL, right?"

His brows lifted. "How’d you know?"

"First time I saw you, you were in YL haute couture. Same at the charity gala."

"Observing me that closely?" He grinned, pleased.

"YL suits you."

"Oh?"

"Flashy. Over-the-top."

Jareth’s smile faltered.

"These are off-the-rack. Deal with it."

"As long as you pick it, I’ll wear it."

Evadne strode into the boutique, commanding immediate attention. The staff froze under her sharp presence.

"Money’s no issue," she said coolly, crossing her legs on the couch. "Pick what you want."

Jareth watched, amused. He was used to spoiling women—never the other way around.

It felt… nice.

Meanwhile, two well-dressed women passed by.

Acacia and her mother, Una.

"Mom! That’s her!" Acacia hissed, spotting Evadne with Jareth.

Una’s eyes gleamed. "This is perfect. Call Thaddeus—tell him you’re feeling unwell. When he sees this, he’ll despise her even more!"

Acacia hesitated. "But I just faked a depressive episode to get his attention. If I push too hard—"

"Men want to feel needed!" Una snapped. "Be helpless. Make him rush to your side!"

Acacia bit her lip but dialed.

Thaddeus answered briskly. "Mrs. Stirling."

"Thaddeus! Have you heard from Acacia?" Una feigned panic.

"No. Why?"

"She went shopping alone—said she needed air. Now she’s not answering! Her phone’s off! What if something—"

"I’ll find her."

Within minutes, Thaddeus stormed into the mall, calling Acacia. She answered, voice frail. "Thaddeus…"

"Where are you?"

"Second floor… by the elevator. I feel… dizzy."

"Stay there!"

He found her slumped on a bench, tears glistening. The moment she saw him, she flung herself into his arms.

"You came," she whispered. "I feel better already."

"Why didn’t you answer your mother?"

"My phone died. I just charged it."

"Don’t go out alone again." His voice softened. "It’s not safe."

She nuzzled his chest. "I only need you."

Nearby, whispers erupted.

"What a gorgeous couple!"

"The girl’s like a painting! And the man—so handsome!"

Thaddeus ignored them—until Acacia gasped.

"Thaddeus… look!"

He turned.

His blood ran cold.

Then boiled.

There, in the boutique, stood Evadne—with Jareth.

His fists clenched.

Fire burned in his eyes.
###Chapter 66

Just a few paces ahead, Jareth and Evadne strolled side by side—one towering with effortless charm, the other a vision of icy elegance. They looked like they'd stepped out of a high-fashion editorial.

Thaddeus's brow twitched when he spotted the shopping bag in Jareth's hand. Since when did they hang out together?

Evadne hadn't noticed Thaddeus and Acacia yet, too absorbed in whatever witty remark Jareth had just made. Her laughter, rare and bright, hung between them like sunlight.

Something sharp twisted in Thaddeus's chest. His vision blurred for half a second.

Jareth sensed the shift first. His head snapped up. "Thaddeus? What are you doing here?"

Only then did Evadne turn. Her smile vanished. Her gaze flicked over Acacia clinging to Thaddeus's arm, and her lips curled in disdain.

Acacia seized her moment, pressing closer to Thaddeus with a triumphant glare at Evadne.

But Evadne just looked bored. Once, this scene might have shattered her. Now? She couldn't muster more than mild disgust. A cheating husband and his tacky mistress—how predictable.

"Interesting question," Thaddeus growled, voice low as thunder. "I should be asking you that, Jareth."

"Retail therapy, obviously." Jareth flashed his trademark grin, either oblivious or deliberately provoking. "You know I can't resist a good sale."

Evadne almost snorted. The man had the attention span of a magpie in a jewelry store. Half their "date" had been him darting into boutiques while she checked her watch.

To Thaddeus, the casual admission felt like a slap. His jaw clenched.

"How cozy," Acacia purred, fingers tracing circles on Thaddeus's sleeve. "Ms. Evadne and Mr. Jareth on a little shopping date. Come on, darling, let's not interrupt their... whatever this is."

Evadne's eyes turned arctic. Jareth stiffened.

Then Thaddeus did something shocking—he shoved Acacia aside and closed the distance between himself and Evadne in three long strides.

"Thaddeus!" Acacia's shriek went ignored.

Evadne had to tilt her head back to meet his glare. Even in heels, he loomed over her. "Problem?"

"What's going on here?" His voice could've frozen lava.

"Retail therapy," she echoed dryly. "We bumped into each other. Should I have taken a detour to avoid offending your delicate sensibilities?"

"You're shopping with him?" The words came out strangled.

"Hey, I'm not the big bad wolf," Jareth cut in, frowning.

"Just a wolf in designer clothing," Thaddeus shot back.

Jareth winced. "Ouch."

"Thaddeus," Evadne sighed, "we're divorced. Who I spend time with is none of your business. This tantrum is embarrassing."

A muscle jumped in his jaw. Was he... jealous? Impossible. Thaddeus didn't love her. This was just possessiveness—the same instinct that made toddlers scream over toys they'd discarded.

"The divorce isn't finalized," he ground out. "Flouncing around with my best friend? Think of the scandal for both families."

Evadne laughed, sharp and humorless. "Scandal? Thaddeus, after three years of marriage, who even knows I was your wife? No public introductions. No wedding. Not even a damn Instagram post." She leaned in, close enough to see his pupils dilate. "Relax. If I plastered my face on every billboard in the city, no one would connect me to you. Now if you'll excuse me."

She sidestepped him, spine straight.

Jareth hesitated only a second before abandoning his friend to follow her.

Thaddeus watched them go, knuckles white, breath coming too fast. It felt like watching someone walk off with something precious he'd forgotten was his.

"Thaddeus," Acacia whined, draping herself over his arm. "I feel faint... Oh, since we're here, let's go shopping! You've never taken me. Look how sweet Jareth is being with Ms. Ice Queen—"

"Fine," he snapped, eyes tracking Evadne like a missile lock.

Evadne stormed down the corridor, heels striking marble like gunshots. Running into her ex was bad enough. Running into him with that leech Acacia? She needed a drink.

"Hey," she barked.

Jareth materialized at her elbow. "Present."

"Tell me something funny. Now."

He rubbed his neck. "Or... I could take you somewhere with actual alcohol tonight?"

"I don't drink with men I don't trust." She shot him a sidelong glance. "Aren't you worried about your bromance with Thaddeus?"

"Please. You're basically divorced. If he's got a problem with me being civil, that's his damage." Jareth scowled. "I didn't sign up for this soap opera."

Just then, a sapphire necklace in a boutique window caught Evadne's eye—a teardrop of midnight blue winking under the lights. She veered inside without thinking.

"May I see this one?" she asked the clerk.

"Excellent choice, madam! This is from our 'Starry Abyss' collection—only five exist worldwide." The saleswoman beamed as she unlocked the case.

Evadne examined it critically. The stone itself was decent, but the craftsmanship? Exquisite. The designer had turned good into breathtaking.

Jareth sprawled on a velvet chair, elbow propped on the armrest, chin in hand. "Like it?"

"Hmm."

"Try it on," he urged, eyes dancing.

"Wow! It's stunning! I must have it!" Acacia's shrill voice cut through the store. Evadne didn't need to turn to know Thaddeus had followed them in.

The clerk gaped. The contrast between the two women was almost cruel—one radiant in effortless chic, the other drowning in try-hard glamour.

"Ugh. Stalk much?" Jareth muttered.

Thaddeus's gaze burned into Evadne's back.

"Darling," Acacia simpered, batting her lashes at Thaddeus, "buy this for me? Pretty please?"

Jareth fake-gagged.

Thaddeus said nothing. Normally, he'd have handed over his card without blinking. But all he could think of was the Ruby Enigma locked in his safe—and the night he'd realized too late what he'd thrown away.

His silence made Acacia's smile falter.

"I'll take it." Jareth slapped down a black card. "Gift-wrapped, please."

Evadne blinked. Before she could protest, another card appeared beside Jareth's.

"Charge it to me." Thaddeus's voice was rough. His eyes never left Evadne's face.
###Chapter 67

Two elite black cards, two of Elmsworth's most eligible bachelors, and they were fighting over a necklace.

Unbelievable.

The attendant's hands trembled as he held the cards. "Gentlemen, we only have one of these necklaces in stock..."

"I know." Thaddeus' cold gaze flickered from Evadne's face. "That's exactly why I want it."

Acacia smirked, already picturing the necklace around her throat.

Evadne pressed her lips together, bitterness flooding her chest. Of course. Anything Acacia desired, Thaddeus would move heaven and earth to give her.

But her own wants? Her feelings? Irrelevant.

"Don't mind him. Swipe my card and wrap it up." Jareth drummed his fingers on the counter. "I said I wanted it first."

"Jareth." Thaddeus' voice was dangerously low.

Jareth met his glare head-on. "Thaddeus, you know me. I don't gift things to just anyone. We've been friends for twenty years. Let me have this one."

Evadne's breath hitched.

Acacia's jaw dropped. How?! How was this divorced woman still pulling men like this?!

Thaddeus' chest tightened. Jareth had never challenged him over a woman before. Never risked their friendship. And now, for his ex-wife—the woman he claimed to despise?

"Thank you, Jareth." Evadne's soft voice cut through the tension. She smiled at him. "I love it."

Jareth's pulse spiked. "Anything for you."

Thaddeus saw red. She accepted Jareth's gift? Right in front of him?!

Jareth fastened the necklace around her slender throat.

Thaddeus' fists clenched, powerless.

"Stunning," the attendant breathed.

"The necklace is beautiful," Evadne murmured.

"No, no! You're the one who makes it shine. Others have worn it, but none like you."

Acacia's nails dug into her palms. She shot Thaddeus a glare, but he just stood there, frozen.

"Jareth, I have work. Let's go."

"Of course."

They walked away like a perfect pair.

"Thaddeus!" Acacia whined. "That necklace was supposed to be mine!"

Thaddeus ignored her, striding after Evadne. "Evadne!"

She turned, icy. "What now, Mr. Thaddeus? Want to rip the necklace off me?"

His jaw clenched. He pulled a velvet box from his pocket and thrust it at her.

"What is this?"

"A bracelet. To replace the one my grandfather gave you." His voice was stiff, refusing to say the words burning in his throat.

She laughed coldly. "No need. My grandfather will replace it. Take it back before your fiancée gets the wrong idea."

"Why take Jareth's gift but not mine?!"

"Because yours makes me sick."

She left him there, gutted.

"See you tonight, Thaddeus!" Jareth called before chasing after her.

Thaddeus' chest ached, her words echoing in his skull.

Acacia stormed over, livid.

Evadne marched through the parking lot, Jareth catching her wrist.

"Let go."

"Was it Thaddeus? I'm sorry—I didn't know he'd be here."

She remembered the box, her heart twisting. Compensation? She didn't want it.

"Take this back." She removed the necklace, handing it to him. "Thank you, but I can't accept it."

Jareth froze. "You used me?"

"I'm sorry."

He should've been furious. Instead, he just felt sorry for her. She wasn't over Thaddeus. She needed time. He'd wait.

"Don't worry. At least you didn't take his gift either." He pocketed the necklace with a forced grin.

"You're a good man, Jareth. You deserve better."

"The better woman is right in front of me."

She smiled sadly and walked away.

Rejected.

That night, Sapphire Nights Lounge.

Thaddeus' mood was black. Jareth had cleared the place, leaving just the two of them.

Thaddeus sat at the bar, the velvet box in front of him. He'd carried it for days, waiting for the right moment. And she'd rejected it.

He swirled his whiskey, seeing Jareth fastening that necklace, her smile—

A smile that used to be his.

Now she gave it to everyone but him.

He downed the drink in one gulp.

"Thad, slow down." Jareth's hand covered his glass.

"What's the point? Better than being betrayed by my best friend."

"Betrayed? When have I ever betrayed you?" Jareth signaled the bartender. "Same for me."

"Stay away from Evadne."

"Why?"

"She's with Cassius."

"Is that the reason, or is it because she's your ex-wife?"

Thaddeus' blood boiled.

"If it's the first, I don't care. If it's the second, I care even less."

Thaddeus slammed his glass down, grabbing Jareth's collar.

"Jareth, as long as I'm breathing, you stay the hell away from her!"
###Chapter 68

Jareth froze under the man's icy glare. Even when Acacia left him to study abroad three years ago, he hadn't been this furious.

Jareth had only been teasing. That was just his nature—wealthy, influential, and blunt. With close friends, he never held back. He'd meant to poke fun at Thaddeus, but he'd accidentally crossed a line.

And that line? His ex-wife.

The bartender paled, trembling. How many people in Elmsworth could push Thaddeus to this level of rage?

"Thad," Jareth ventured cautiously, "have you... fallen for her?"

Thaddeus's grip tightened, his knuckles white. His head had cleared slightly, but his chest ached like a vice had clamped around it.

"Thad, you've changed since the divorce." Jareth studied him intently. "We've known each other since we were kids. Don't you think it's time to be honest?"

"I don't like her," Thaddeus ground out, as if the words tasted bitter.

"Fine. You don't like her. Then let's drop it."

"Jareth!"

Ignoring his fury, Jareth pressed on. "Listen, if you still have feelings for her and want to fix things, I'll support you. But if you're just pissed because another man is pursuing her, then step aside. Because I know what I want. I like her, and I plan to chase her."

Thaddeus staggered back as if struck, his breath ragged.

Jareth straightened his suit, exhaling sharply before pulling a velvet box from his pocket. The sapphire necklace glinted under the dim light.

Thaddeus stiffened. "She—"

"She refused it." Jareth laughed bitterly. "She's not the gold-digger you think she is. After leaving you, she returned everything. Thaddeus, what the hell did you do to her? Every time she sees you, it's like facing an enemy. Doesn't that tell you something?"

Thaddeus's jaw clenched. Memories flooded him—the handmade suit, the gifts she'd painstakingly prepared, all ignored. A sharp pang twisted in his chest.

After work, Evadne didn’t go home. She sent Jason ahead and headed to the cathedral instead.

The grand golden dome loomed above, majestic and serene. Cassius stood beneath the towering cross, clad in his priestly robes, delivering his sermon with quiet authority. Evadne sat in the back, absorbing his words like a balm to her soul.

When the service ended, Cassius closed his Bible and approached her with a gentle smile. "You should've told me you were coming." He ruffled her hair affectionately.

"I didn’t want to disturb you," she murmured.

"Something’s bothering you." He sat beside her, his voice soft.

"Is it that obvious?"

She exhaled, frustration darkening her expression. "Cassius, I messed up today. I used Jareth to provoke Thaddeus. I knew it was wrong, but I couldn’t help it. Seeing him with Acacia, watching him compete to buy her a necklace—it hurt. I wanted him to feel even a fraction of what I feel."

Cassius sighed, wrapping an arm around her. "You still love him, don’t you?"

She leaned into him, her lashes damp. "I gave him my youth, my heart. How do I just... stop?" Her voice cracked. "I’m scared I’ll never love anyone like that again."

"Love isn’t finite, Evadne. Pain fades. The heart heals." He tilted her chin up. "Be brave. Chase what you want—or let it go. But don’t let fear decide for you."

"I chased him once. Look where that got me." She laughed bitterly. "Wrong time, wrong person. I don’t think I can do it again."

Cassius frowned. At her age, she shouldn’t sound so jaded. "You loved him deeply. That’s not wasted. Maybe it just wasn’t meant to be."

"Or maybe I was blind."

Her phone buzzed—Jason.

"Miss! Finally! The signal here’s terrible!" His voice crackled with excitement. "Check the live stream! Glynnis is holding a press conference—she’s apologizing to our staff!"

Evadne shot to her feet, shock flashing across her face.

The Abernathy Group had folded too quickly. Yesterday, Glynnis had been ready for war. Today, she was surrendering? Something—or someone—had forced her hand.

Frederic doted on Glynnis. Elspeth shielded her. The only person who could’ve made this happen was...

No.

Evadne shoved the thought aside and opened the live feed.

The screen exploded with comments as Glynnis, pale and stiff in a black dress, bowed before the press.

"Due to my emotional outburst, I unjustly blamed an innocent employee..." Her voice wavered. "I deeply regret my actions."

The crowd wasn’t buying it.

"Pathetic! She’s still acting!"

"Where’s this energy when she was bullying that girl?"

Evadne smirked. Glynnis’s pride was finally crumbling.

Then another call interrupted—just as things were getting interesting.
###Chapter 69

Isabella Sinclair grabbed her phone with trembling fingers. "What's wrong, Nathaniel?" Her voice was barely above a whisper.

"Damn it, Isabella! Why is it so hard to reach you these days?" Nathaniel Prescott's tone crackled with barely contained frustration.

Her delicate brows knitted together. "Just tell me what happened."

"Did Alexander Kingsley contact you today?"

"No. Why?"

A heavy sigh traveled through the phone line. "We got drunk last night. He said... things he shouldn't have."

Isabella's pulse stuttered.

Everyone knew Alexander's peculiar trait - when intoxicated, his words weren't empty threats. The man possessed an eidetic memory, recalling every slurred syllable with crystal clarity the next day. A terrifying skill for someone in his line of work.

"What exactly did he say?" Her grip tightened around the phone.

"That he's going to make Nathaniel Vanderbilt pay. That he won't rest until that bastard suffers ten times what he put you through." Nathaniel's voice dropped to a hushed panic. "I thought he'd listen to reason after sobering up, but he's been ignoring my calls all day. You don't think he'd actually—"

The blood drained from Isabella's face. Without another word, she spun on her heel and bolted for the church exit.

Meanwhile, at the press conference...

Gwendolyn Vanderbilt's half-hearted apology had backfired spectacularly. The live audience erupted in outrage, their fury rippling across social media platforms.

Elspeth had personally crafted the apology speech and insisted Gwendolyn appear makeup-free. But the arrogant heiress had other plans - arriving with full glamour, hoping to trend as "New York's Most Beautiful Socialite."

The gamble failed. Miserably.

[K Group's hospitality is unmatched! Employees like 'Angel Girl' deserve all the recognition!]

[Never booking Vanderbilt Hotels again!]

[Let's boycott them into bankruptcy!]

As Gwendolyn finished her disastrous statement, reporters swarmed like vultures. Microphones jabbed at her face, questions sharper than stilettos. Two bodyguards barely managed to extract her from the frenzy.

Then came the final humiliation - she missed a step, twisting her ankle with an undignified shriek. The viral clip of her being carried out like a limp doll would haunt her for years.

At that exact moment...

Nathaniel Vanderbilt and Julian Montgomery staggered out of Sapphire Nights, arms slung over each other's shoulders. The whiskey had melted their animosity into something resembling camaraderie.

Julian remained relatively sober. Nathaniel, however, was in bad shape - tie askew, pupils dilated, the sharp angles of his face flushed with alcohol.

"You good, man?" Julian steadied him.

"Never better." Nathaniel rubbed his temples. "Your bartender needs firing. That was straight gasoline."

"Christ, no wonder Isabella left you." Julian swallowed hard, suddenly aware of how dangerously attractive his rival looked in disarray.

Nathaniel shoved him away. "I'm walking myself home."

"Like hell. You'll get mugged—or worse."

"Worried someone will take advantage?" Nathaniel smirked. "Not everyone has your lack of boundaries, Julian."

With that, he stumbled toward his Maybach.

En route, his assistant Gordon updated him on the PR disaster. "Gwendolyn's antics are tanking Vanderbilt Group's stocks, sir."

"Our Vanderbilt Group?" Nathaniel's laugh was bitter. "How convenient they remember I exist when there's damage control needed."

He'd never been family to them. Not really. Only old Reginald had ever treated him as such. Tonight's fiasco? Poetic justice for using him and hurting Isabella.

His wife.

The word sent an unexpected jolt through his system. That infuriating, mercurial woman. Had her little performance with Julian been revenge? Or something crueler?

"Pull over," he growled.

Gordon obeyed, parking beside a deserted park. "Do you need—"

"Stay here." Nathaniel lurched out, desperate for air that didn't reek of betrayal.

The night breeze helped. A little.

Then his instincts screamed danger.

"Show yourself," he demanded.

"Impressive." The voice was velvet wrapped in steel.

Nathaniel turned slowly. A figure emerged from the shadows - all black, from trench coat to mask. A specter with piercing eyes that felt... familiar.

"Who the hell are you?"

"Your reckoning." The man cracked his knuckles. "You hurt someone precious to me. Tonight, I return the favor."

Nathaniel's alcohol-fogged brain struggled to place him. "Who did I supposedly hurt?"

The masked stranger advanced. "You really don't remember? How typical." His gloved hands flexed. "Maybe pain will refresh your memory."
###Chapter 70

The voice was both familiar and strange, cutting off abruptly. Alexander Kingsley's gaze locked onto the man before him, moving with an almost spectral swiftness. Dominic Sinclair was making aggressive moves, each punch sharp and lightning-fast, clearly aiming to take him down hard.

Alexander's brows furrowed as his large frame dodged twice.

"Not bad," Dominic taunted, eyes narrowing mockingly. "You still got some fight in you."

Alexander exhaled sharply, his eyes glinting with intensity.

He had left the military years ago. Though he still trained occasionally, it had been a long time since he'd been in a real fight.

All he had left were his instincts and muscle memory.

After a few exchanges, something struck him—Dominic's fighting style was eerily familiar.

Those moves... they bore the distinct mark of elite military combat training.

Who the hell was this guy?

"Ah!" A sudden kick to his abdomen sent Alexander stumbling back, pain flaring through him. But he didn't fall—just staggered, teeth gritted.

Damn, this bastard was strong.

"Mr. Kingsley!"

Sebastian Lockwood gasped, rushing forward to steady him. "Are you okay?"

"I'm fine," Alexander muttered, suppressing a cough.

"You son of a bitch!" Sebastian's face flushed with rage. "You dare lay a hand on him? I'll kill you!"

"Sebastian! Get back!"

Too late.

Sebastian lunged recklessly, but Dominic sidestepped effortlessly, knocking him out with a single brutal punch.

Alexander's fury ignited. "I know you. Who the hell are you?"

Dominic smirked, tilting his head.

They did know each other. Same academy, same training. But they'd never crossed paths outside of drills.

"You wanna know who matters most to me?" Dominic took slow, deliberate steps forward, grinning darkly. "Fine. I'll tell you."

He leaned in, voice dripping with malice.

"It's your ex-wife."

Alexander's pupils constricted, his fists trembling with barely restrained rage.

"You're dead."

His muscles coiled beneath his tailored suit, radiating lethal intent.

Then he struck—fast, brutal, every movement honed by years of discipline.

Dominic's expression darkened. Even out of practice, Alexander was still dangerous. His agility defied his polished exterior.

Like some goddamn action hero.

The fight raged, blow after blow exchanged. But Alexander was flagging—his limbs heavy from alcohol, his vision swimming. It was a miracle he was still standing.

Then Dominic landed a crushing hit, sending him crashing to the ground, pain exploding through his back.

"Bastard," Dominic spat, raising his foot to deliver another kick—

"Touch him again, and you won't leave Elmsworth alive."

Nathaniel Whitmore appeared like a storm, gun drawn and aimed squarely at Dominic's head.

Dominic froze.

"Don't move," Nathaniel warned, finger tense on the trigger. "I will shoot."

"Nathaniel, stand down!" Alexander rasped, clutching his ribs.

"Are you kidding me?" Nathaniel's voice shook with fury. "He nearly killed you! One wrong move, and I swear, the Whitmores will make you disappear!"

Dominic didn't flinch. He took another step.

"Nathaniel, run!" Alexander shouted.

The gun fired.

But the bullet didn't hit Dominic.

"Ugh—"

Isabella Sinclair staggered forward, arms wrapped tightly around Dominic. The bullet struck her shoulder.

Even though it wasn't lethal, the impact was brutal.

She trembled, sweat beading on her forehead, but she held on—refusing to let go.

Alexander's heart plummeted.

His wife—his ex-wife—had just taken a bullet for the man trying to kill him.

Not a glance his way. No hesitation.

She'd chosen.

Betrayal burned through him like acid.

"Isabella!"

Dominic's hands came away bloody. Rage and anguish twisted his features.

"You bastard!"

Nathaniel paled, the gun slipping from his fingers.

Isabella had moved too fast. He hadn't meant to—

"Isabella," Dominic choked out, clutching her.

She leaned into him, voice a whisper. "If you ever cared about me... leave. Now. Or I swear, I'll never forgive you."

Dominic hesitated, but her glare was final.

With a last, agonized look, he vanished into the night.

Isabella exhaled shakily, then turned—ignoring her own injury—to check on Alexander.

"Mr. Whitmore, call an ambulance. Now."

"But you're hurt!" Nathaniel protested, guilt-ridden.

"I'll live," she gritted out, already kneeling beside Alexander.

"Stop playing the hero," Alexander snarled, pushing her away. "Get lost."

"Not until I know you're okay."

Her hands were steady as she examined his leg. Bruises marred his face, blood smeared his lips, his pristine suit ruined.

Her heart ached. Dominic had gone too far.

"I said leave!" Alexander roared.

"No! You have old injuries—I need to make sure!"

He stared at her, baffled.

How did she know about that?

The ambulance arrived, whisking Alexander and Sebastian away.

Thankfully, the damage was superficial. No fractures, no torn muscles. Isabella finally let herself breathe.

At the hospital, Nathaniel hovered outside her treatment room, frantic.

"How bad is it? Did it hit bone?"

Isabella managed a weak smile. "Just stitches. I'll live."

"Just stitches?" Nathaniel's voice cracked. "Isabella, this is serious! What if there's permanent damage?"

She arched a brow. "What, disappointed I'm not crippled?"

His jaw clenched. "If you were... I'd marry you."

She blinked. "What?"

Nathaniel's eyes burned with conviction. "I'd take responsibility. Always. If you were hurt because of me, I'd spend the rest of my life making sure you never suffered again."
###Chapter 71

"Oh my God! Alexander! Are you okay?" Isabella silently cursed inside, then forced a laugh. "Mr. Kingsley, you certainly have a way with jokes today. Enough to keep me on my toes."

"I'm serious, Isabella. I'm not joking!" Alexander's voice rose, his large hand reaching out to grip her shoulder, but she smoothly twisted away.

"Mr. Kingsley, as I recall, I've already said everything I needed to say today. Must I spell it out for you?"

"I know you've already rejected me."

Alexander stared at her, his dark eyes filled with bitterness. "I also know you're with Nathaniel now. But I still want you to know—if you ever change your mind, I'll be here. I don't mind being your second choice. Or even your lover."

Isabella nearly scoffed. Lover? What do you take me for?

Yet there was something undeniably magnetic about his gaze, especially now, shadowed with melancholy. No wonder he had always been so successful in love.

Too bad she was completely immune.

Compared to him, she preferred Sebastian's eyes—cold, piercing, yet impossible to ignore.

"Isabella, who was that man who attacked Sebastian? Are you close to him?" Alexander pressed, his tone urgent.

"Mrs. Kingsley!"

Before she could answer, Gordon appeared, dressed in hospital scrubs.

"Why are you out of bed?"

Isabella quickly stepped past Alexander, steadying Gordon. "Even though your injuries aren't severe, you still suffered a concussion. You should be resting, not wandering around."

"Mrs. Kingsley, did you save Mr. Sebastian?" Gordon asked eagerly.

"I didn't do much," she murmured, guilt tightening her chest.

"I knew it. I knew you still cared about him!"

"Is Mr. Sebastian done with his treatment?" Isabella swiftly changed the subject.

Gordon nodded, hopeful. "Mrs. Kingsley, could you stay? Just to see him."

With a deep breath, she walked toward Sebastian's room, her steps heavy.

After all, it was her brother who had hurt him. She couldn't just walk away.

Inside the ward, Sebastian leaned against the bedframe, staring out the window. Despite the bruises marring his face, his sharp features remained striking. His usual cold, proud gaze held a rare vulnerability now, softening his edges.

This was the face she had loved for thirteen years.

Even now, it stirred something in her—though not the same desperate passion as before.

"Mr. Kingsley."

"About tonight—I will get answers. Before I lose my temper, get out of my sight." His voice was ice.

Isabella had always been stubborn. The more someone told her not to do something, the more she wanted to do it.

She stepped closer, meeting his frigid glare head-on. "Mr. Kingsley, I came to apologize. If you want to press charges, do it against me. He hurt you because of me, so I'll take responsibility. If you prefer to settle this privately, I'm willing. If you want to make it public—well, I doubt you'd enjoy the scandal. You're about to marry Victoria. A public feud with your ex-wife won't look good."

Every word cut deep.

She was defending the man who had attacked him. Protecting him.

And Sebastian? He was nothing but a joke to her.

"Isabella, who is he? What is he to you? Why would you risk your life for him?" His voice was rough, his eyes burning.

"The gun wasn't real. I'm fine."

"Does that matter? The moment you stepped in front of him, it meant everything!"

He tried to rise, but pain forced him back. Frustrated, he slammed a fist against the mattress. "You claimed to love me for three years. Yet nothing you did ever proved it. Did you think I was blind?"

The alcohol had stripped away his restraint.

A disciplined soldier, he had endured gunshot wounds without a sound. But this pain—this betrayal—he couldn't control.

"So you're not angry because someone hurt you for me. Not because I nearly died. You're angry because you think I lied to you. Because your pride can't take it." Her voice dripped with disappointment.

Sebastian glared but said nothing.

"Sebastian, we're over. Why does any of this matter?" She exhaled sharply. "You're just furious because what was once yours now belongs to someone else. You hate losing control. That's all this is."

His jaw clenched. "Tell me who he is. Tell me your relationship with him, and I'll drop this."

"No."

"Then leave Nathaniel. Cut ties with the Lockwoods. Maybe then I'll consider settling this privately."

She laughed coldly. "In your dreams."

Her lips, soft and tempting, curved with defiance.

Sebastian's gaze darkened. Maybe it was the alcohol. Maybe it was something else.

But right now, he couldn't resist.

"Fine. If you won't talk, I'll have my lawyers handle this." She turned to leave.

In a flash, he grabbed her wrist, yanking her against his chest.

Her body collided with his, her breath hitching as she felt his heartbeat—wild, unsteady.

"Sebastian! Let—mmph!"

His mouth crashed onto hers.

She shoved at his shoulders, but his hand tangled in her hair, holding her in place as he deepened the kiss.

His lips were relentless, his tongue claiming hers with a hunger that left her dizzy.

"Mmph—let go—!"

Her protests dissolved into breathless gasps. She struck his shoulder, but he only kissed her harder, swallowing every sound.

Heat flooded her cheeks. Her knees weakened.

Three years of marriage, and he had never once kissed her like this.

Now? He was devouring her like a man starved.

It was too much. He was too good at this.

How many times has he kissed Victoria?

The thought sent fury through her. With a sharp bite, she drew blood.

"Ah—!" He jerked back, his lips stinging.

"Bastard!" She slapped him—hard.

The sound cracked through the room. A red mark bloomed on his cheek.

Rage flared in his eyes—until he saw hers, glistening with unshed tears, her lips swollen from his kiss.

His anger faltered.

"Sebastian! What am I to you? You humiliated me during our marriage, and now, even divorced, you think you can just—just take what you want?" Her voice shook as she wiped her mouth. "If you need to vent, find someone else. But if you think you can manipulate me, think again. Next time, I'll break more than your pride."

With that, she stormed out.

Sebastian stared after her, regret twisting in his chest. He opened his mouth—but no words came.

What the hell had he just done?

He had kissed her. Like a madman.

Before he could process it, Alexander strode in.

"Sebastian, what was that shouting? I heard you two all the way down the hall." His gaze dropped to Sebastian's bruised lips. His eyes widened. "Oh my God. You didn't—? You're about to marry another woman!"
###Chapter 72

The pounding in Sebastian's head was relentless, the last traces of alcohol fading fast. He'd never been the type to make the first move—never been the one to initiate a kiss.

The only two times it had happened, it was Isabella who'd pressed her lips to his, and even then, he'd only allowed the barest brush against the corner of his mouth.

But tonight? With Evelyn?

He'd been a man possessed.

A beast unleashed, driven by something raw and uncontrollable. He didn’t recognize himself.

"Too much to drink. I wasn’t thinking." Sebastian leaned back, rubbing his temples. "Never drinking like that again. Too damn reckless."

"You’re a drunk and a lecher!" Lucas snarled, pacing like a caged animal. If he weren’t injured, he’d have already thrown a punch. "You forced yourself on Evelyn! You’re disgusting!"

The liquor had stripped away his restraint, but he couldn’t deny the truth—the moment his lips met Evelyn’s, the sweetness had been intoxicating.

"Get out," Sebastian muttered, his jaw tight. "I’m done."

"You’re heartless!" Lucas shot back, fury burning in his eyes. "She’s injured, Sebastian. She has stitches. And you—you take advantage of her like this?"

Sebastian’s chest tightened.

Evelyn stormed into the bathroom, splashing cold water on her face before fleeing the hospital.

Rage simmered beneath her skin.

They were divorced.

He had no right.

No right to kiss her. No right to touch her.

Was she just an outlet for his drunken desires? The thought made her sick.

"Evelyn!"

A familiar voice cut through the night air, and before she could react, strong arms wrapped around her.

"I’m sorry," Nathaniel whispered, his voice thick with emotion. "I should’ve been here sooner."

"I’m fine," she said stiffly.

Nathaniel knew about her injury, so he kept his grip gentle. "Does it still hurt? Let me take you to our hospital. We’ll get the best surgeon—"

"I said I’m fine."

She forced herself to breathe, to steady the storm inside her.

Her expression was ice.

"Where’s Adrian?" she demanded. "I want to see him. Now."

The penthouse was alive with tension.

Nathaniel sat calmly by the table, sipping tea as if the world weren’t crumbling around them.

Oliver and Harrison stood beside Evelyn, two towering men dwarfed by the sheer force of her anger.

"Evelyn," Harrison began carefully, "Adrian’s your brother. Try to stay calm."

"He’s a professional," Oliver added, though his voice lacked conviction. "He just wanted to protect you."

"Professional?" Evelyn’s laugh was sharp. "He’s a damn hitman."

She turned her glare on Oliver. "When you called me earlier, you were worried he’d kill Sebastian. What changed?"

"Snitch!" Adrian hissed, shooting Oliver a venomous look. "You’re dead."

"Oh, so now it’s my fault?" Oliver threw his hands up. "Fine. Evelyn, don’t go easy on him. He deserves whatever’s coming."

If Adrian was going down, Oliver wasn’t going down with him.

"Adrian!" Evelyn snapped. "You still think you did nothing wrong?"

"Wrong?" Adrian scoffed. "I beat up the bastard who hurt my sister. Where’s the crime in that?"

"You’re impossible!"

Frustration boiled over. She slammed her fist against the armrest—then winced as pain shot through her shoulder.

Instantly, the room erupted.

"Evelyn!"

"Are you okay?"

"Miss, we need to get you to a hospital—"

Nathaniel, Oliver, Harrison, Adrian—all of them were on their feet, panic written across their faces.

Adrian dropped to his knees in front of her, cradling her hand like it was made of glass.

"Evelyn, please," he begged, his voice breaking. "Hit me. Yell at me. Just don’t—don’t hurt yourself."

"Do you finally understand?" she whispered.

The guilt was crushing. His sister had taken a bullet for him. And now? He’d made her pain worse.

"I just—I couldn’t stand seeing him hurt you," Adrian choked out. "You’re everything to us. We’ve spoiled you since you were a kid. No one gets to treat you like that."

Evelyn’s eyes burned.

"Listen to me," she said, her voice steady despite the ache in her chest. "I married Sebastian willingly. I knew he loved someone else. I knew he was cold. I thought I could change him—but I failed. That’s on me. Not him."

Adrian flinched.

"Letting go isn’t easy," she admitted softly. "I loved him for years. Even now, he still has a piece of my heart. But this? Fighting, hurting each other—it doesn’t help. Did you even think about how I’d feel, watching you attack him?"

"Evelyn, I—"

"I screwed up!" Adrian blurted, desperation clawing at him. "I’ll do anything. Just—just forgive me. I won’t touch him again. I swear."

He’d faced death without flinching. But the thought of losing his sister’s forgiveness? That terrified him.

Evelyn studied him, then sighed.

"Fine," she said, a faint smirk tugging at her lips. "Then before you leave in a few days, you’re coming home with me. We’re having dinner with William."

Nathaniel and Oliver exchanged glances.

Adrian grimaced—but if it made Evelyn happy, he’d endure it.

"Deal," he muttered. "I’ll be there."
###Chapter 73

The press conference had been a catastrophic failure for Glynnis, shattering the elegant facade Elspeth had meticulously built for her. That evening, Glynnis stumbled into Windermere Estate, barely able to stand, supported by her attendants.

"Mother, you must help me get revenge! I need to restore my reputation!"

Tears streamed down Glynnis's face, her composure obliterated. "The internet is flooded with hateful comments about me. I can't face anyone now!"

"Revenge? How? Should I slap Thaddeus across the face, or force him to resign and hand his CEO position to you, you foolish child?"

Elspeth glared at her tear-streaked face, fury simmering in her eyes. "What did I tell you before you left? Stick to the script—no makeup, appear genuine! But what did you do? You ruined everything! This is your own doing, and now you come crying to me? What good are tears? Even your father wants nothing to do with you!"

"Mother, I was wrong. I shouldn’t have disobeyed you. I won’t be so reckless again!"

Glynnis dropped to her knees, clutching Elspeth’s legs. "Mother, while Thaddeus played a part, the real villain is that witch Isabella! If she hadn’t provoked me, none of this would’ve happened!"

"Oh, we’ll deal with Isabella." Elspeth’s lips curled into a venomous smile. "Your grandfather’s birthday is approaching. I’ve arranged for Isabella to humiliate herself publicly—and for you to reclaim your dignity."

"Mother! What’s your plan?" Glynnis sniffled, her mood instantly lifting at the mention of Isabella’s downfall.

Elspeth folded her arms, smirking. "You’ll see."

Just then, Glynnis’s phone buzzed.

She glanced at the screen and shrieked, startling Elspeth.

"What are you screaming about at this hour?"

"That bitch Isabella must pay!" Glynnis screeched, her rage spiraling into hysteria.

Simultaneously, Elspeth’s phone rang. It was Acacia.

"What is it, Acacia?"

"Auntie, have you seen the photos I sent Glynnis?" Acacia’s voice dripped with faux concern.

"Photos?"

Elspeth snatched Glynnis’s phone and gasped.

"I ran into Isabella and Mr. Jareth at the mall today while shopping with Thaddeus. They looked intimate—like a couple. Worse, Mr. Jareth gifted her an exorbitant sapphire necklace—the very one Thaddeus was supposed to give me. But Mr. Jareth bought it and handed it to her."

Acacia sighed dramatically. "To me, it’s just jewelry. But for Glynnis? This is about her future. She’s meant to marry into the Jareth family. If Isabella interferes, how can Glynnis accept that?"

"That woman exists to torment us! How dare she meddle with my future son-in-law!"

Elspeth’s grip tightened, her eyes glinting with malice. "If she enjoys stealing, I’ll let her steal until it destroys her!"

Isabella’s days were numbered. Mr. Hamilton’s birthday would be her undoing.

For three days, Thaddeus remained hospitalized.

He kept his condition secret, brushing off Acacia’s attempts to visit with vague excuses.

Every night, his mind replayed the moment he’d kissed Isabella.

His lips still tingled with the memory of her softness.

Had he lost his mind? Absolutely.

Alcohol was a curse.

Thaddeus vowed never to engage with Isabella again.

Yet by the fourth day, when she hadn’t visited, his irritation resurfaced.

Heartless woman.

"Mr. Thaddeus, the doctor has cleared you for discharge." Gordon entered, holding fresh attire.

"Did Isabella contact you?" Thaddeus’s voice was ice.

"No."

"She nearly kills me, and that’s it?"

His fist clenched, his expression darkening. "The military academy graduation photo I asked for—did you find it?"

"Here."

Gordon set down the suit and retrieved a navy-blue album from his briefcase.

Thaddeus flipped through it, scrutinizing each face.

The masked man from that night—his combat style had been familiar. Thaddeus, trained in military tactics, never forgot an opponent.

Then he froze.

His sharp inhale made Gordon tense.

"Mr. Thaddeus?"

"So it’s him."

The photo showed a striking man in uniform—Elvis Waverley.

"Isabella Waverley. Elvis Waverley. Siblings. Of course."

Elvis had been Thaddeus’s only rival at the academy. Post-graduation, they’d lost touch.

Now, Thaddeus’s curiosity about Isabella’s secrets deepened.

But before he could dwell, a knock interrupted.

Gordon opened the door—and stiffened.

"Good afternoon, Mr. Gordon."

Jason stood there, holding an expensive gift. "Ms. Isabella sent me to check on Mr. Thaddeus. Is he available?"

"Enter." Thaddeus’s tone was frigid.

Jason stepped inside, placing the gift on the table. "Ms. Isabella predicted you’d be discharged today. She was right, as usual."

"Did you come alone?" Thaddeus’s gaze flicked past him, searching.

"Ms. Isabella is occupied assisting President Ashbourne at the hotel. As her personal secretary, my presence equals hers."

The first half was Jason’s addition—a deliberate jab.

Thaddeus’s jaw tightened. "I don’t want hollow pleasantries. Take the gift back."

"Ms. Isabella said if you refuse it, discard it. She never takes back what she gives."

"Tell Isabella to see me." Thaddeus rose, his imposing frame radiating authority.

"Apologies, Mr. Thaddeus. Ms. Isabella is unavailable. All compensation matters will be handled by me. State your demands—within reason, and she’ll comply."

"I want her."

"No."

"Then why are you still here?" Gordon snapped. "You’re just here to provoke us!"

Jason’s smirk said exactly.

"Tell Isabella this." Thaddeus’s voice turned lethal. "She hands over the man who attacked me, or this isn’t over."

"The Abernathy Group’s legal team is formidable, but K Group’s isn’t weak either. If you sue your ex-wife before your wedding, President Ashbourne will intervene."

Jason’s gaze hardened. "But as a businessman, you know lawsuits are messy. Smart men avoid them."

With a bow, he turned to leave—then paused.

"Oh, Ms. Isabella asked: Was Glynnis’s press conference your doing?"

"That’s Abernathy business. Not yours."

"Very well. Goodbye."

Jason exited, leaving tension thick enough to slice.

"That wasn’t a visit—it was a taunt!" Gordon growled.

Thaddeus exhaled sharply. "Follow him. Report his every move."
###Chapter 74

The K Orld Hotel buzzed with activity, but inside her office, Evadne was in her own world.

She gripped the controller tightly, her character wielding a chainsaw as she chased down survivors in the game. The adrenaline rush was exactly what she needed.

On her desk sat a greasy box of fried chicken and an ice-cold beer—her ultimate gaming fuel.

No five-star French cuisine or royal banquet could compare to this simple pleasure. As she took another bite, a bitter memory surfaced.

For three years after marrying Thaddeus, she had endured the agony of her smoke allergy, wearing a mask in the kitchen just to cook him gourmet meals.

She had foolishly believed that if she could master the art of cooking, he might look at her differently.

So she secretly enrolled in Elmsworth’s most prestigious culinary school, the only woman in a room full of rowdy men.

By the time she graduated, her skills had surpassed even her instructor’s. He had praised her as his greatest student, a shining testament to his career.

But none of it mattered.

Thaddeus barely ate at home, and when he did, he never once complimented her food.

The realization had stung—no matter how well she fed him, she could never satisfy his heart.

Evadne bit into another piece of chicken, imagining it was Thaddeus’ neck.

At least now, she was free.

If magic existed, she’d sell love in a heartbeat—trade it for her father’s health and her family’s safety.

A knock interrupted her thoughts. Jason stepped in.

"Miss, I delivered everything and relayed your message."

She smirked. "Let me guess—he refused to settle privately?"

"Exactly. He said unless you hand over Elvis, there’s no deal."

"Delusional," she scoffed, finishing another round of her game. "There’s no footage of the incident. Even if he drags this to court, he’s got nothing."

The Ashbournes weren’t fools. They protected their own.

"But Miss…" Jason hesitated. "Thaddeus might be onto something. When I saw him, he had his military school yearbook out. He’s digging."

Evadne’s fingers stilled.

"Relax," she said after a beat. "Elvis’ records are locked down by National Security. No one can tie him to the K Group. Let Thaddeus waste his time."

Her mother had given birth to quadruplets—two took their father’s name, two took hers.

Cassis and Arnold were identical. Bet and Elvis? Polar opposites.

A genetic fluke that worked in their favor.

"Oh, and I asked Thaddeus about the press conference," Jason added.

Her eyes sharpened. "And?"

"He said it’s Abernathy business, not his. Looked like I owed him a fortune."

Evadne’s grip tightened on her beer.

She knew Thaddeus—ruthless in love, but brutally honest otherwise. If he hadn’t orchestrated the leak, he’d have denied it outright.

"So it was him," she muttered.

Jason frowned. "But why? Damaging Abernathy’s reputation hurts him too."

A memory flashed—Thaddeus’ possessive kiss, his hands gripping her like she was his.

Her cheeks warmed. She tossed the chicken bone into the trash with unnecessary force.

"Who knows? Maybe he’s finally lost it. Three years together, and I never noticed."

That evening, Cassis’ Rolls-Royce pulled up to the hotel, drawing admiring glances.

Unnoticed in the shadows, a black Maybach idled.

Inside, Thaddeus’ gaze locked onto the scene, his jaw clenched.

Evadne emerged, breathtaking in a sky-blue silk dress, her hair cascading down her back.

She had always been stunning—sharp suits, red lips, a force to be reckoned with.

But today, she looked softer. Effortlessly elegant.

And it burned him.

For three years, she had dressed plainly—white dresses, sneakers—as if he couldn’t afford to spoil her.

Everything Cassis gave her, he could have too.

So why had she hidden her beauty from him?

As she slid into Cassis’ car, Thaddeus growled, "Follow them."

The Rolls-Royce glided toward Skyrim.

Evadne proudly handed Cassis her latest financial reports and expansion plans.

"See? Two months, and I’ve outperformed everyone’s expectations. Not bad for your little sister, huh?"

Cassis ruffled her hair affectionately. "You’re not just smart—you’re a natural. What takes others a year, you conquer in weeks."

She grinned. "I’m not just conquering Skyrim. Elmsworth is next. The Abernathy monopoly ends with me."

"Confident," he mused. "But going head-to-head with Thaddeus… you ready for that?"

"Bring it on," she said, eyes blazing. "I lost in love. I won’t lose in business."

"Then you have my full support."

"Oh? What’s that entail?" She rubbed her hands together eagerly.

He smirked. "Prayers. Divine intervention."

Behind them, the Maybach trailed silently.

"Sir, they’re heading to Skyrim," Gordon noted.

Thaddeus’ fingers dug into his seat. "So she’s introducing him to her family already?"

"Looks like it. If you don’t act fast, she’ll be Mrs. Ashbourne."

"She wouldn’t dare," Thaddeus hissed. "We’re still married. She thinks I’ll just disappear?"

It hadn’t even been a week since Cassis beat him to a pulp.

No call. No concern.

Just straight to her new lover’s side.

Was she that desperate to humiliate him?

"But sir… after your grandfather’s birthday, the divorce is final. You won’t have a say."

Thaddeus’ chest tightened.

For the first time in years, panic clawed at him.
###Chapter 75

The vintage gates of Silvercrest Manor swung open as a Rolls Royce glided through, its polished exterior reflecting the golden hues of the setting sun.

Instantly, the household staff buzzed with excitement.

"Miss Sinclair has returned!"

Before Isabella and Nathaniel could even step out of the car, the butler and servants had already lined up in perfect formation, bowing deeply.

"Welcome home, Miss!"

"May you always be blessed with health and joy!"

Isabella smiled warmly. "And the same to all of you."

Then, a familiar voice cut through the air.

"Isabella! You're finally back! We've missed you terribly!"

Turning, she saw Sophia and a striking woman with short, sleek hair rushing toward her. Dressed in a deep violet satin blouse and tailored wide-leg trousers, the woman was none other than Alexander Sinclair's youngest wife, Victoria Sinclair.

"Sophia, Victoria." Isabella embraced them both, her heart swelling with affection.

Nathaniel watched the scene unfold, his expression unreadable.

The Sinclair family was the most powerful dynasty in New York, its intricate web of relationships and feuds legendary. When Victoria had entered the picture, chaos had erupted, driving Isabella to leave home and become a doctor without borders, enduring hardship and solitude. But over time, these women had chipped away at her walls with their unwavering sincerity. Nathaniel had played no small part in that, sharing countless stories to help Isabella accept them.

The real challenge, however, was her father, Alexander.

"Isabella, you've gotten too thin," Victoria chided, shooting Nathaniel a pointed look. "If you're too busy to take proper care of her, just say so. We'll handle it. You promised she'd gain weight, and now she looks like she's been starved. Explain yourself."

Nathaniel chuckled. "My mistake. I'll make it up to her."

Isabella rolled her eyes playfully. "Victoria, you know I can eat a feast and still not gain a pound. Nathaniel even assigned his personal chef, Daniel, to look after me. You've tasted Daniel's cooking—I'm spoiled rotten every single day. Stop worrying."

Victoria snorted. "As if Daniel could compare to Eleanor. The moment she heard you were coming home, she locked herself in the kitchen like she's preparing for a royal banquet. Your father joked it's more elaborate than hosting foreign dignitaries."

Isabella laughed. "Eleanor takes things too seriously. A simple family dinner would've been enough—it's about being together, not the food."

"We all offered to help, but she refused," Sophia added with an amused sigh. "Said she doesn't trust anyone else's cooking skills. Who knew the gentlest among us could be so stubborn?"

"Eleanor doesn't distrust you, Sophia. It's Victoria she's wary of, right?" Isabella teased. "After you burned four pots, triggered the fire alarm three times, and nearly blew up the stove twice, she banned you from the kitchen for life."

"Isabella, must you always expose me?" Victoria huffed, reaching out to tickle her.

"Best friends tell the truth!" Isabella dodged, laughing.

Their playful banter filled the air, light and carefree.

But whenever Isabella thought of Eleanor Sinclair, memories of her past life as Adrian Kingsley's wife resurfaced.

For three years, she had walked on eggshells, desperate not to displease Adrian or the Kingsley family.

Three years had felt like a lifetime of suffering. Eleanor had endured twenty. How had she survived?

Women shouldn't have to diminish themselves for men. They should stand tall, unshaken, like roses blooming defiantly in winter—not withering away in gilded cages. What a waste.

A small crowd gathered around Isabella as they escorted her into the grand estate.

The evening breeze was cool, the crescent moon hanging like a delicate silver thread in the sky.

Meanwhile, a Maybach sat silently outside Silvercrest Manor, swallowed by the night's shadows.

Gordon opened the car door, and Adrian stepped out, his piercing gaze fixed on the illuminated gates across the street.

"I've heard Alexander Sinclair has a taste for European architecture and owns dozens of estates nationwide. Seeing it in person, the rumors don't do it justice."

Gordon admired the elegant, timeless design of Silvercrest Manor. "It's like something out of a fairy tale. Even Windermere Estate pales in comparison."

Realizing his slip, Gordon quickly pressed his lips together, chastising himself internally.

Adrian's eyes darkened, deeper than the night itself, as they reflected the vibrant glow of the Sinclair residence. Faint laughter and chatter reached his ears, and an icy chill seeped into his bones, spreading through his veins.

As Nathaniel's girlfriend, Isabella was clearly adored by the Sinclair family.

At first, Adrian had assumed the dynamics would be complicated. Alexander had three wives besides his late first wife—though none were legally married, each had borne him children.

He'd thought Isabella would struggle to fit in, that the three wives would be insurmountable obstacles. That she'd eventually retreat.

But instead, she thrived.

Their laughter carried for miles, effortless and genuine.

The Sinclairs loved her.

Adrian's face paled, his chest tightening with an unfamiliar, suffocating ache.

"Got a cigarette?" he asked hoarsely.

"Alexander! I'm home!" Isabella called out the moment she stepped into the grand foyer.

"Took you long enough. I was about to perish from hunger!"

Alexander grumbled as he strode forward, his butler Arnold trailing behind.

"Wow, looking sharp, Alexander. Dressing up just for me? Trying to outshine everyone?" Isabella teased, eyeing his crisp white shirt, tailored waistcoat, and the fine gold watch chain draped across his vest. Despite his age, his features remained striking—every inch the aristocratic patriarch from a period drama.

"Outshine you? Please. I could grace magazine covers in my sleep. Thirty years ago, women would've plastered my face on their walls," Alexander scoffed.

"Uh, Dad, that sounds more like a memorial than admiration," Arnold muttered.

"Must you ruin the moment?" Alexander shot him a glare.

Everyone knew—except Alexander himself.

"Where are the others? You didn't call Daniel and Aaron back, did you?" Isabella asked warily.

"Miss, would we dare disobey your orders?" Sophia replied with a knowing smile. "Don't worry, we kept it quiet."

"Hmph. So you deliberately excluded those jerks? No wonder they didn't show up—they didn't even know!"

Alexander sighed dramatically. "It's a family dinner. You should've called them home for a reunion!"

"Daniel married into the Helgen family—it's too far for a quick trip. Aaron's buried in cases at the precinct, and our youngest sister has exams. She can't just leave campus. Stop complaining! Isn't this crowd enough for you?" Isabella retorted.

"What about Oliver? That boy does nothing but laze around. He's in Elmsworth—a two-hour drive at most. Why isn't he here? Did he drop dead?" Alexander snapped, irritation flaring at the mention of his fourth son.

"Oliver, he—" Before Isabella could finish, a smooth, amused voice interrupted.

"I was waiting for you to scold me. If you hadn't said anything, how would I make my grand entrance?"

Everyone turned to see Oliver Sinclair strolling in, hands tucked into the pockets of his sleek black trench coat, a smirk playing on his lips.

"Alexander Sinclair, I'm still alive. Disappointed?"

The moment Oliver appeared, Sophia and Victoria discreetly stepped back, their smiles fading.

They knew how much Oliver despised this family—and them in particular. Best to stay out of his line of fire.

Isabella exhaled in relief.

Of course. Oliver, the phantom of the Sinclair family, appearing and vanishing at will, avoiding them like the plague.

"So, is dinner ready? Let's eat so I can get back to my thrilling life of doing absolutely nothing," Oliver drawled, his sharp gaze lingering on Isabella.

His expression was clear: I showed up. Don't be mad anymore.

Isabella's eyes flickered, and she deliberately looked away.

The tension in the room dissolved instantly.

Alexander rubbed his temples in exasperation before marching up to his son.

"Send me a recent photo of yourself."

"Why?"

Alexander's expression darkened.

"Because one day, you might actually vanish, and I won't even have a picture to remember you by! Send it. Now."
###Chapter 76

"Damn it!" Emeric's words were downright cruel. What kind of father wished death upon his own son?

"Seriously? Was that really necessary?"

Elvis narrowed his eyes at his father, one brow arching slightly. "I suppose I should take extra good care of myself—for your sake. After all, when you're lying on your deathbed someday, and the doctors need a family member to make the call, I doubt my brothers will have the stomach for it. So, you'll have to count on your ever-dutiful son—me."

"You dare decide my fate? I'll teach you a lesson!"

Emeric exploded, shouting for the butler to discipline him while itching to hurl his handmade leather shoes straight at Elvis' smug face.

Cassius and Arnold struggled to calm him down. Suri and Aviana tried their best to soothe him, but nothing could extinguish Emeric's fury.

Then, a soft, melodic voice cut through the tension.

"Um... dinner is ready. Should we eat?"

The room fell silent. All heads turned.

Myra stood there, slender in her apron, spatula in hand, her porcelain skin glowing under the chandelier's light. She blinked at them, confused.

Gurgle.

Emeric's stomach answered for him.

"Fine! Let's eat! I'll need my strength to deal with you later!"

Relieved sighs filled the room as everyone followed Emeric to the dining hall.

"Elvis, that was too far. Dad may be broad-minded, but you shouldn't say things like that." Cassius fixed his brother with a stern look.

"Who said I was joking? I meant every word." Elvis smirked.

"Elvis." Cassius' expression darkened, his gaze turning icy—like a winter storm had just swept through.

"Ugh, why so serious? He cursed me first—I just returned the favor. Fine, forget it. Stop glaring at me like that; I won't be able to sleep tonight."

Elvis shivered dramatically, then obediently shuffled toward the dining room, muttering under his breath.

Cassius sighed, his expression softening as he followed.

"Damn. Only Cassius can tame Elvis. One look, and he turns into a docile kitten."

Arnold tried mimicking Cassius' deadly glare, furrowing his brows until his eyes strained. "I need to master that look. Then maybe Elvis won't dare defy me!"

Evadne shot him a disdainful glance. "Stop. You look ridiculous."

Tonight, Emeric was in unusually high spirits, downing glass after glass of wine, his face flushed with merriment. Suri tried to stop him multiple times, but he waved her off. Though he and Elvis sat at opposite ends of the table without exchanging a word, everyone noticed how Emeric kept sneaking glances at his son—like he was someone precious, someone deeply missed.

Elvis felt those lingering stares but always averted his gaze.

The old man's heart sank a little each time.

Evadne, ever perceptive, caught every subtle shift in the atmosphere. It unsettled her.

She knew Elvis' pain hadn't faded. He still resented Emeric for not loving their mother exclusively.

The Ashbourne empire was vast, their wealth immeasurable. Even divided among eight siblings—or sixteen—it would never run dry.

Emeric, the family's charismatic patriarch, was a man of honor and charm. In his youth, he'd narrowly escaped assassination attempts. In his prime, he'd rewritten business history.

A near-perfect man—except for one flaw.

His inability to be faithful.

No one was perfect. Truly, no one.

Like Elvis, Evadne had once cried, raged, and hated. But she'd let it go.

Because some things couldn't be changed, severed, or forgotten.

She didn't expect Elvis to forgive Emeric. She wouldn't justify their father's actions. She just wanted Elvis to release his pain, to step out of their family's shadow.

As dinner wound down, Elvis leaned back, satisfied.

"Honestly, that woman can cook. I had three servings tonight. Gonna need extra gym time tomorrow."

"Elvis, don't talk like that. Myra has her own struggles," Evadne said, her gaze complicated.

"Struggles? Please. Once she married Emeric, she became Mrs. Ashbourne. Living the dream." Elvis' voice turned cold. "Evadne, shouldn't our mother be the one you pity? While this 'happy family' dines together, while Emeric hops from one wife's bed to another—do you think he ever remembers her?"

Evadne's heart clenched. "Of course I pity Mom. I think about her every day. But Elvis, she's gone. We have to move forward. We're Ashbournes. This family—this legacy—needs us."

"You can move on. I can't. I live in the past. You're still my family, but this place... it's not home anymore."

Silence settled between them.

"Alright, alright. Don't look so heartbroken." Elvis pulled her into a hug, his tone softening. "Enough of this. Let me tell you something fun—Thaddeus is here."

"What?!"

Evadne's pulse spiked. She nearly jumped out of her seat.

The entire table froze.

Emeric scowled. "What's wrong with you? You scared me half to death!"

"Wasn't my fault! I was just telling Evadne a story. Didn't expect her to freak out." Elvis grinned.

"Story? More like a horror movie!" Evadne gasped.

"Don't believe me? Go check. He might still be waiting outside. But relax—he probably doesn't know who you really are. My bet? He tailed your car with Cassius."

No sooner had he spoken than Evadne's phone buzzed on the table.

She inhaled sharply, flipping it over.

That familiar number glared back at her. She declined the call instantly.

But a second later, it rang again.

Realizing Thaddeus wouldn't give up tonight, Evadne excused herself to answer in private.

"Hello," she whispered.

"Are your injuries better?" His deep voice carried through the line, laced with the chill of the night breeze.

Her heart fluttered. "Mhm."

"I'm outside Cassius' estate. Come out."

His tone was as commanding as ever.

Irritation flared. All his tenderness was reserved for Acacia. With her? Only coldness.

She owed him nothing. They were divorced. He had no right to order her around.

"I'm at a family dinner with the Ashbournes tonight. Everyone's here. I can't leave."

A beat of silence.

Then, through the phone, Thaddeus heard it—laughter, chatter, the warmth of a family gathering.

A warmth he'd never known.

"Come out. Or I'll come in and get you myself."

His voice was low, desperate.

Evadne's grip tightened on the phone. It felt like his hand was around her wrist, refusing to let go.

"Mr. Thaddeus, this isn't the time. I'll see you back in Elmsworth."

"Evadne!"

She took a sharp breath. His urgency sent shivers down her spine.

"Come out. Or I'm coming in. Your choice."

His voice was raw, his body tense.

Right now, he didn't care about consequences.

He just wanted to take her home.
###Chapter 77

"Alexander, when are you going to stop this childish behavior?" Isabella snapped, her voice sharp as shattered glass. "Your constant harassment is beyond ridiculous. Do you realize how pathetic you're being? I already sent Olivia to handle the situation after you got hurt. What more do you want from me?"

"I wanted to settle this privately," Alexander's breath hitched slightly, his voice unsteady. "Meet me tonight, and we'll consider the matter closed. No more grudges."

"You're unbelievable!" Isabella gasped.

Was this really Alexander Kingsley? The man who used to be so composed now acting like a lovesick fool - had he lost his mind completely?

"Fine. I'll meet you. But remember your promise - this ends tonight."

She slammed the phone down with enough force to crack the screen.

As Isabella stormed out, the head butler intercepted Olivia in the hallway. "Miss Bennett, there are two black sedans with license plate V777 parked outside for over an hour. Two men in suits keep watching the house. Should I activate the security protocols?"

Olivia's brow furrowed. "Don't alert Mr. Sinclair. I'll handle this personally."

The butler nodded and retreated.

Olivia immediately summoned Vanessa and Gabrielle for an emergency huddle near the grand staircase.

"We've got trouble brewing."

"Trouble?" Vanessa blinked her doe eyes in confusion.

"Spit it out already," Gabrielle demanded, cracking her knuckles.

"That bastard Alexander is outside right now, probably here to make Isabella's life miserable again," Olivia hissed, her gaze turning glacial.

"What? That heartless snake dares show his face here?" Gabrielle's face flushed crimson as she rolled up her sleeves. "I'm going to—"

Vanessa grabbed her arm with surprising strength. "Gabrielle, think! We can't let Mr. Sinclair find out!"

"I won't stand by while that monster comes to torment Isabella again!" Gabrielle's voice trembled with rage. "After everything he's put her through? Forcing a divorce, humiliating her - our family won't tolerate this!"

"None of us will tolerate it," Olivia said urgently, "but Isabella made us promise not to interfere. If you attack him now, you'll only make things worse for her. She wants a clean break from the Kingsleys, not more drama."

"I think Alexander might be having second thoughts," Vanessa murmured, her delicate features creased with worry. "Everyone knows his reputation - ice-cold, never been with anyone except Victoria. For him to come all the way from Manhattan to Skyrim... Could he actually regret divorcing Isabella?"

"That snake doesn't have a heart to feel regret!" Gabrielle spat. "Even if he did, it's too damn late! Just seeing his face makes my skin crawl!"

"Isabella slipped out earlier," Olivia said, a calculating gleam in her eyes. "She must be meeting him now. You two stay here and cover for her with Mr. Sinclair. As for your anger... I'll make sure you get your revenge tonight."

The autumn wind carried a biting chill through Skyrim's streets.

Dominic shivered in his suit, watching his boss stand motionless in the cold like some tragic statue. Alexander seemed determined to wait all night if necessary, leaving Dominic no choice but to suffer alongside him.

Alexander had endured worse during his military days - standing at attention for twenty-four hours straight. A few hours in the cold meant nothing.

But his heart wasn't as disciplined.

What if Isabella changed her mind? What if she never came? Would he have to knock on the Sinclair mansion's door?

What excuse could he possibly give for showing up unannounced?

His pulse raced uncomfortably. With trembling fingers, he lit his last cigarette.

Just as the flame touched the tip, footsteps echoed on the pavement.

"Alexander."

His heart stuttered at the sight of his ex-wife's frosty expression. The cigarette slipped from his fingers, scattering ashes at his feet.

Isabella glanced disdainfully at the littered ground. "I thought you quit. Pathetic."

"Waiting for you... took longer than expected." He hastily crushed the cigarette underfoot, never breaking eye contact.

"Hmm, blaming me again? How typical." Her laugh held no warmth.

"Isabella." His voice came out rougher than intended, throat raw from smoke and emotion.

"You got what you wanted. Now leave my brother alone. I have work to do, so if you'll excuse me." Her porcelain face might as well have been carved from ice. "And clean up your mess before you go. Skyrim doesn't need your trash."

She turned on her heel with military precision.

Dominic gaped at the transformation. The Isabella he remembered had been sunshine incarnate - warm, radiant, always smiling at Alexander like he hung the moon.

Now? She looked at his boss like he was something scraped off her shoe.

What the hell had Alexander done to turn such devotion into such disdain?

"Isabella, wait!" Alexander's voice cracked with desperation. "I didn't say you could leave!"

She froze, slowly turning with lethal grace. "How amusing. I don't belong to you, Alexander. You were so eager to discard me during the divorce. Now I'm walking away of my own accord, and suddenly you have objections? What exactly will satisfy you?"

That word - divorce - hit like a physical blow. Alexander's breath left him in a rush, his chest tightening painfully.

Humiliation burned through him, twisting into something ugly and raw. His vision tinted red at the edges. "I warned you before we married it was just business! I offered you a generous settlement, but you walked away with nothing! Don't paint me as the villain here, Isabella. You made your choices. We may not part as friends, but you don't get to act like some martyr. You owe me nothing, and I owe you nothing! You have no right to treat me this way!"
###Chapter 78

Nathaniel watched as the tension between them escalated again, his fists clenching in frustration. He desperately wanted to intervene, to silence the boss’s cruel words before they did more damage.

Isabella let out a soft, bitter laugh, her eyes shimmering like fractured diamonds—broken yet still radiant. "Sebastian, I’ll admit it. I was arrogant. I chased you relentlessly, showered you with kindness, convinced I could make you love me. But in the end, all I got was self-delusion. You’re wrong about one thing, though. Even when you pushed me away, I never resented you. I wanted a clean break, but you kept dragging me back, tearing apart whatever dignity we had left. So I had no choice but to cut you out of my life. Sebastian, you were forced into this marriage, and now I’m forced to treat you like this. The only way we both move on is if we become strangers."

Sebastian felt like he’d been struck in the chest with a hammer, his breath hitching in his throat.

"Mr. Nathaniel, it’s time. Please take Mr. Sebastian home."

Isabella swallowed the ache in her chest and turned away sharply.

If he couldn’t see her love, he didn’t deserve her pain.

Suddenly, a sharp grip clamped around her wrist. She spun around to meet Sebastian’s bloodshot gaze.

"Sebastian, let go." She tried to pull free.

Before he could speak, a cold voice sliced through the air.

"Mr. Sebastian, a man of your standing, accosting our future daughter-in-law on our doorstep? How disgraceful."

Isabella saw Arabella and Genevieve rushing toward them. She wrenched her arm free and stepped back.

"Future daughter-in-law?" Sebastian’s voice was hollow, his expression blank.

"Alexander brought her home for dinner tonight," Arabella said smoothly, draping a protective arm around Isabella’s shoulders. "She’s elegant, well-mannered, and perfect for our family. Even Chairman Reginald approves. We’re already discussing wedding arrangements."

Isabella stiffened. She knew they were helping her, but this was… excessive.

Sebastian’s chest felt like an empty cavern, the wind howling through it.

"Mr. Sebastian, didn’t you just announce your engagement in the press?" Genevieve’s sharp eyes pinned him in place. "Shouldn’t you be with your fiancée instead of harassing Isabella? A woman’s reputation matters. If you don’t care about yours, fine. But don’t drag her down with you. She’s part of the Sinclair family now. Push any further, and we won’t be so polite."

Isabella exhaled. Genevieve was usually the type to throw a punch first. The fact that she was still talking meant Arabella and Margaret had reined her in.

Nathaniel groaned internally. Mr. Sebastian, what are you doing? This is self-sabotage.

Sebastian’s hand, which had just touched Isabella, slowly curled into a fist, trembling slightly.

He tried to hold onto something—anything—but his grip was slipping. He wasn’t even sure what he was trying to keep. He had been the one to end things.

"Ladies, it’s freezing out here. Let’s go inside."

The words Let’s go home slipped out before Isabella could stop them. The sense of belonging was so strong it erected an invisible wall between her and Sebastian.

"Isabella," Sebastian’s voice was rough, barely audible. "Is this true?"

She took a steadying breath. "Yes."

"Fine." His face paled. He repeated the word like a mantra before pulling a velvet box from his pocket and holding it out.

"A wedding gift."

Isabella stared at it, stunned. She hadn’t expected him to still have it.

"Maybe she’s too embarrassed to take it. I’ll do it for her."

Before she could react, Genevieve snatched the box and flipped it open. Inside lay an exquisite amethyst bracelet, its purple gems glinting under the light.

Isabella recognized it instantly—rare, priceless. Once, she would’ve been overjoyed to receive anything from Sebastian. Now, it meant nothing.

Late affection was worthless.

"Beautiful craftsmanship," Genevieve mused, then her expression darkened. With one swift motion, she hurled the bracelet to the ground.

The gems shattered between them like broken promises.

Sebastian’s face went deathly pale.

Isabella flinched, unable to look at him.

"Madam!" Nathaniel exploded. "That was a gift from the heart! You had no right—"

"Why give it now?" Genevieve cut in, her stiletto grinding the shards into the pavement. "After the divorce? After humiliating her? Are you trying to rub salt in the wound?"

Each word was a dagger.

Sebastian’s throat worked silently before his shattered gaze finally met Isabella’s.

Her pulse stuttered. She looked away, tugging Genevieve’s arm. "Let’s go."

"Madam," Nathaniel muttered, devastated that she hadn’t defended Sebastian.

If he felt this betrayed, Sebastian must be shattered.

"Enough," Genevieve said, linking arms with Isabella. "We have a party to enjoy. No need to let outsiders ruin it."

Arabella shot Sebastian one last disdainful glance. "He brought this on himself."

Back inside, Isabella’s mask crumbled. She felt hollow.

The bracelet. His expression. It hurt more than she expected.

She knew they meant well, but this didn’t feel like justice. It felt like cruelty.

"Isabella!"

Oliver burst in, breathless. "Alexander and Dad are fighting again! Dad hit him!"
###Chapter 79

12:50

The backyard was silent except for the crunch of gravel beneath Alexander's polished shoes as he stormed toward his Lamborghini. His jaw was clenched, his eyes glacial.

"Alexander!" Isabella sprinted after him, her fingers wrapping around his wrist. "Where the hell do you think you're going?"

"Somewhere far from this place. Preferably where I never have to come back." He turned, lips curling into a bitter smirk, the fresh bruise on his cheekbone stark under the moonlight.

"You told me once that the most important people in your life were your brothers and me. We're right here. This is your home. How can you just walk away like it means nothing?" Her grip tightened, her chest aching as if someone had reached in and twisted her heart.

Alexander studied her face, his thumb brushing gently over her cheek. "You'll always be in my heart. I kept my promise to you. You're not angry with me anymore, are you?"

Isabella swallowed hard, her vision blurring.

"If you really want to respect Emeric, the best thing you can do is let me disappear from his sight. I have work to do. I'll come back to see you another time."

"Alexander." Sophia rushed forward, clutching a small bag in her hands.

He paused, surprise flickering in his eyes. "Sophia."

Her lashes were damp, her voice trembling as she held out the bag. "Inside—there are some of the new medications developed by Bright Group. They're strong, might help you. And snacks. Myra made them. She was worried you'd get hungry on the road."

A faint smile touched her lips. "It's nothing much. Hope it's not a bother."

Alexander's fingers tightened around the bag, his voice softening. "Thank you. But I have everything I need where I'm going. Don't worry about me."

He pulled Isabella into a fierce embrace, then turned and walked away. The Lamborghini's engine roared to life, tires screeching as it vanished into the night. Isabella and Sophia stood frozen in the yard, the weight of his departure pressing down on them.

"Let him go, Sophia." Isabella squeezed her shoulder. "He did what he had to. He just needs time."

"I know," Sophia whispered, pain flickering in her eyes. "He's protecting me. But he doesn't have to. I'm fine. Really."

Isabella said nothing.

Two years ago, tragedy had struck the Sinclair family like a hurricane.

Sophia's eldest son, Isabella's half-brother, and a decorated airline pilot, Harrison, had made the ultimate sacrifice. When Flight H676 malfunctioned, he steered the plane toward the ocean to save 150 passengers.

Harrison drowned on his 27th birthday.

Love was complicated, but no one could deny Harrison had been a hero.

The Maybach sped back toward Elmsworth.

Gordon kept stealing glances at Nathaniel in the rearview mirror, his stomach twisting at the sight of his boss's ashen face. Nathaniel's lips were bloodless, his knuckles white where they gripped the seat.

"Mr. Kingsley, are you—"

"Drive." Nathaniel's voice was raw.

He had stormed in, convinced he had the upper hand, certain he could force Isabella to submit. Instead, he had been humiliated beyond measure. The shattered bracelet wasn't the only thing broken—his pride lay in pieces too.

"Sir, if I may—" Gordon hesitated, then blurted, "If you want Mrs. Kingsley back, just tell the Sinclairs the divorce isn't finalized. She's still your wife. I can't stand how those women talk to you like—"

"So you think the only way I can keep her is by using legal technicalities?" Nathaniel's laugh was hollow.

"No! I just—" Gordon wiped his brow. "If you still care about her, why not just tell her how you feel?"

"Feelings?" Nathaniel's teeth ground together. "I've made up my mind. I will never remarry her."

"But tonight—"

"Drive."

The command was a whip-crack. Gordon flinched and fell silent.

Nathaniel slumped back, only then noticing the sharp sting in his palm. He unclenched his fist, revealing bloodied shards of the bracelet embedded in his skin.

He didn't understand this fury inside him, this desperate need to tear Isabella away from Sebastian. He just needed them apart.

After seeing Alexander off, Isabella went to check on her father with Sebastian and Oliver before finally dragging herself to the hallway. She pulled out her phone and sent a quick message.

[Meet me in the garden. Now.]

Fifteen minutes later, Sophia, Myra, and Arabella stood before her like guilty schoolgirls.

"Nothing to say?" Isabella arched a brow, arms crossed.

Sophia stayed quiet.

Myra fidgeted.

Arabella, ever blunt, broke first. "You're the one who called us here. Why are you asking?"

Isabella massaged her temples. Arabella's logic was as straightforward as a brick to the face.

"Nothing to say about how you all ganged up on Nathaniel tonight?"

"Please." Arabella dropped onto the bench opposite her, cool as ice. "If these two hadn't stopped me, I would've had Rudi teach him a lesson hours ago."

"Who's Rudi?"

Sophia sighed. "Her pet alligator. Birthday gift from Emeric."

Isabella stared.

Myra quickly intervened. "Arabella, enough—"

"Every word is the truth!" Arabella's eyes burned. "Nathaniel is worse than Rudi! You were his wife! You gave up everything for him, and he threw you away like trash the second it suited him! I hope he rots!"

"He doesn't love me. That's all there is to it." Isabella's voice was flat. "He's marrying the woman he loves. I lost. End of story. Don't make this messier than it already is."

"Are you kidding me?" Arabella shot to her feet, gripping Isabella's shoulders. "How can you say that? You carried his child!"

The words were a knife to the chest. Isabella went deathly pale.

"Arabella! We agreed never to bring that up!" Sophia gasped.

"Don't," Myra pleaded. "Not this..."

"He doesn't know." Isabella's voice was barely audible. "I never told Nathaniel about the baby."
###Chapter 80

This was the darkest, most agonizing secret Isabella Sinclair had ever carried.

Two years ago, she lost her baby. For months afterward, she couldn’t walk past a children’s boutique without her chest tightening. The sound of a child’s laughter made her flinch. Even a diaper commercial could send her spiraling into grief.

She would never forget that Christmas Eve. Snow had been falling in thick, silent flakes as she drove her grandfather to the coast to admire the winter seascape. Then the accident happened. Despite the searing pain in her abdomen, she hauled her injured grandfather back into the car and sped toward the hospital.

At the time, the Prescott family was vacationing in Europe. Nathan Prescott was overseas, celebrating the holidays with Victoria Sterling.

Isabella endured the agony alone until Alexander Dubois arrived. The moment she saw him, her knees buckled.

“Mrs. Prescott! You’re—you’re bleeding!”

Through the haze of pain, she saw crimson staining her dress. The metallic scent of blood clung to her memory like a curse. Only then did she realize—she had been pregnant. Two months along.

She had lost Nathan’s child before ever knowing it existed.

“Mrs. Prescott! I’ll call Mr. Nathan immediately!”

Alexander fumbled for his phone, but Isabella’s icy fingers clamped around his wrist.

“Don’t.” Her voice cracked. “Please. He doesn’t know. It would destroy him. He’d blame me.” Tears streaked her cheeks as she begged. “Keep this secret for me. Please.”

She curled in on herself, arms wrapped around her empty stomach, choking on sorrow.

Now, in the present, she watched as Olivia Bennett, Sophia Reynolds, and Evelyn Prescott clung to her, their faces etched with horror and grief.

“This is my fault! I won’t mention it again—never again!” Olivia’s voice was thick with remorse, her attempt at comfort clumsy but earnest.

“The baby was lucky.” Isabella forced a brittle smile. “If it had lived, it would’ve grown up watching its parents tear each other apart. Better this way.”

That night, sleep eluded her. Every time she closed her eyes, she saw the blood. The tiny, lifeless form. She buried her face in the pillows, but the cold emptiness in her chest refused to fade.

In the days after the miscarriage, she had wept uncontrollably. Bullets and battlefields had never frightened her, but losing that fragile life had shattered her soul.

“I’m sorry,” she whispered into the dark. “I don’t know if I’ll ever get to hold you in this lifetime.”

By morning, she had pulled herself together. When she descended the stairs, she was every inch the poised, untouchable heiress.

“Isabella, I made breakfast. Your favorites.” Sophia adjusted her apron, studying Isabella’s bloodshot eyes with a pang of sympathy.

“Pack it to go. I’ll eat in the car.” Isabella’s smile was flawless, her pain locked away. “High-level meeting at The Chateau Royale this morning. Can’t be late.”

“Of course. I’ll pack something for Mr. Daniel too.”

“Thank you, Sophia.” Daniel Carter strode in just in time to hear his name.

Isabella left the villa with Daniel. Emeric was still asleep—she had no intention of waking him before slipping back to New York.

“Isabella, running that hotel alone is insane. If the Prescotts give you trouble, don’t take it lying down.” Evelyn’s jaw clenched as she recalled the auction where Isabella had been cornered by Victoria and her cronies. “Next time, I’ll make them regret it.”

“Damn right.” Olivia cracked her knuckles. “They’ll wish they’d never crossed you.”

Isabella laughed despite herself.

Evelyn came from a dynasty of surgeons. The Bright Group owned half the hospitals in New York and Seattle. If she wanted someone to suffer, they would.

“Actually, I need a favor.”

“Name it,” Evelyn and Olivia said in unison.

“I want the Dante Chair Emeric had you bid on at the last auction.”

They gaped at her. “You’ve got guts.”

Emeric would hand over his fortune without blinking. But his art collection? Not a chance. Especially not a Renaissance masterpiece worth millions.

“He’ll never agree. Why do you want it?” Evelyn frowned.

“If I tell you, he’ll say no for sure.”

“Leave it to me.” Olivia smirked. “If he refuses, I’ll steal it for you.”

Isabella’s laughter was genuine this time.

After returning from Seattle, Nathan Prescott spent one restless night at home before dragging himself to work.

Victoria called twice. He answered, but his mind was elsewhere. She prattled on about wedding gowns, exclusive jewelry, a fairytale venue—endless details for the wedding that would finally be announced at Hamilton’s eightieth birthday gala next weekend.

12:50 PM.

“Nathan, what do you think? My team and I have been planning this for months!” Victoria’s voice dripped with pride.

“Whatever you like.” His reply was absent as he stared at a broken gemstone bracelet in a velvet box. His thoughts were consumed by Isabella and the Ashbournes’ icy rejection.

He snapped the box shut with a sigh.

“Nathan, the designer is waiting. We need your measurements today.” Victoria’s tone turned wounded. “He flew in from Paris just for us.”

“Sorry. Work’s been chaotic.”

“It’s fine. I’ll handle everything.” Her smile was audible.

“I’ll pick you up this afternoon.”

The moment he hung up, Lawrence Bennett rushed in with a file. “Mr. Prescott, we’ve secured a meeting with Ada Ang’s agent. These are the wedding venue proposals. The Abernathy needs this.”

Nathan skimmed the documents. The scandal involving Glynnis had tanked the Abernathy Hotel’s reputation. Meanwhile, The Grand Marquis was trending globally.

He had no interest in salvaging Glynnis’s image, but as CEO, the Abernathy Group’s survival was his responsibility. Hosting Ada Ang’s wedding would be a coup—a spectacle to reclaim their prestige.

“I’ll review this with the board. It’s critical.” He closed the file.

“Sir, there’s something else.” Lawrence hesitated. “The other contender for Ada’s wedding is… the general manager of The Grand Marquis. Isabella.”

Nathan’s expression darkened.

That scheming woman again.
###Chapter 81

"Are you certain about what you heard?" Alexander Kingsley's voice was sharp, his piercing gaze fixed on his assistant.

Sebastian Lockwood hesitated before responding. "Mr. Kingsley, we didn't have to dig deep for this. I spoke with Isabella's agent yesterday. She informed me that Nathaniel Hawthorne from Essence Haute had already reached out before us. They made it clear—they intend to publicly compete for her endorsement."

Sebastian's words faltered as Alexander's expression darkened.

"What else did she say?"

"The agent mentioned that while The Regal Palace has an impeccable domestic reputation, Essence Haute has been gaining significant traction lately. She suggested we both present our strongest proposals. Whoever offers the better terms and vision will secure Isabella's partnership."

Alexander slammed his fist on the desk, frustration boiling over. First Evelyn Prescott, now Nathaniel Hawthorne—were these two determined to make his life difficult?

"Call an emergency meeting with all senior executives first thing tomorrow. We need the most elite wedding proposal drafted immediately. I refuse to let Essence Haute steal this deal!" His voice was steel. "If we lose Isabella to them, heads will roll."

Sebastian swallowed hard. The man wasn't joking—this was the same ruthless CEO who had once stormed up ten flights of stairs in a rage.

That afternoon, Alexander's Maybach pulled up to a grand six-story European mansion in Windsor Estates.

"I thought we were meeting the designer?" Alexander frowned at the sprawling rose garden.

"We are. This is the private atelier of Camille Dubois, the world-renowned designer behind Rozabe." Victoria Sterling's eyes sparkled with excitement. "While Rozabe has boutiques worldwide, their ready-to-wear line isn't for us. Only Camille's haute couture is worthy of our wedding."

She had gone all out for today—freshly curled and dyed hair, a daring red backless dress, lips painted a bold crimson. But the sight of that red only made Alexander think of Evelyn. That shade belonged to her—on anyone else, it looked garish.

"Clothes are just clothes. I don’t need them. Order whatever you want for yourself." His tone was dismissive.

"No! As your wife, I should oversee your wardrobe. From now on, you’ll only wear what I choose. No more accepting gifts from other women!" Victoria clung to his arm, her voice dripping with possessiveness.

Alexander stiffened. He thought of the suit Evelyn had tailored for him—damaged, yet carefully preserved. And how had she treated his gift? Letting it be destroyed, discarded like trash. His jaw clenched. "Fine. I won’t."

As they approached the entrance, a guard stopped them. "Apologies, but Ms. Dubois is hosting a private event today. Entry is by invitation only."

Victoria smirked, producing two rose-embossed invitations. "Of course we're invited."

Inside, the hall buzzed with laughter and clinking glasses, guests mingling with wine in hand.

Alexander tensed. He hadn’t expected an event—especially not one Victoria had orchestrated behind his back. No wonder she’d dressed to impress. He hated being paraded around like a trophy.

The moment they stepped in, whispers erupted.

"Is that Alexander Kingsley?"

"He’s even more striking in person!"

"Who’s the woman with him? So lucky!"

"That’s not just any woman—that’s his fiancée, Victoria. He married her right after divorcing Evelyn Prescott. She must have serious skills."

Victoria preened under the attention, relishing the envy. She’d pulled strings to get these invites, and now, she was basking in her victory.

"You should’ve told me about this. You know I don’t attend these things." Alexander’s voice was ice.

"Alexander, I don’t have the influence to secure Camille’s designs alone. I needed you here. With your presence, she’ll agree—"

Seeing his stormy expression, she backtracked. "I’m sorry. Did I overstep?"

"Next time, inform me. I’ll arrange it. You don’t need to drag me along." His tone softened slightly.

Just then, familiar footsteps echoed behind him—crisp, confident, unmistakable. Alexander turned.

Sunlight streamed through the roses, their fragrance rich in the air. And there, gliding in with effortless grace, was Evelyn.

Dressed in an elegant blue gown, a matching shawl draped over her shoulders, her hair swept up to expose her delicate neck. She wore minimal makeup, yet her presence commanded attention. Some women didn’t need embellishments to shine.

Victoria’s face twisted in jealousy. She’d thought her red dress would dominate—but Evelyn in blue had stolen the spotlight effortlessly.

Alexander’s throat tightened. He tried to look away but couldn’t. And then—she walked right past him as if he were invisible.

Heat flared in his chest.

"Ms. Prescott," Victoria sneered, stepping forward. "I’m surprised you managed an invite. Must’ve been difficult."

Evelyn smiled coolly. "It was. Every guest here has a direct connection to Camille or her brand—rising stars, industry titans, or VIP clients. So, Miss Sterling, which one are you?"

Victoria flushed. "I—"

"Neither you nor Mr. Kingsley belong here. Yet here you are. Quite the accomplishment."

Victoria’s temper snapped. "Everyone knows who Alexander is! You think Camille would refuse the CEO of Sinclair Holdings?"

"Fair point." Evelyn nodded.

"Then what about you? Some VIP? A fashion icon?"

"Neither."

"Then what’s your excuse? A country girl who got lucky—what right do you have to be here?"

Victoria could only attack her roots. The truth—that Evelyn was Alexander’s ex-wife—terrified her.

"Victoria, enough." Alexander’s voice was a warning.

The crowd’s eyes flicked between them. This poised, magnetic woman—a country girl? Impossible.

Then, a voice cut through the tension. "Ms. Dubois is here!"

All heads turned as Camille descended the staircase—regal in a pink Rozabe ensemble, her expression haughty—until she spotted Evelyn.

Her demeanor transformed instantly. Rushing forward, she beamed. "Master! You didn’t tell me you were coming!"
###Chapter 82

Gasps echoed through the room. Isabella Sinclair stood frozen, her carefully cultivated poise shattered. Her lips parted in shock. This couldn't be real. She must be hallucinating!

Camille Dubois was twenty-four this year, wasn't she? Victoria Sterling had four years on her, a decade in the fashion industry under her belt. Paris Fashion Week regular. International awards collector.

How could this rural caregiver possibly be Victoria's mentor? The absurdity made her head spin.

Isabella's mind reeled.

Camille's arm snaked possessively around Natalia Petrov's waist. "You should've warned me you were coming!" she pouted. "I had no time to prepare!"

"Wasn't planning to attend," Natalia shrugged. "Last-minute cancellation freed up my schedule."

"So I'm just an afterthought?" Camille feigned offense.

"Watch your tone," Natalia teased. "Getting bold, aren't we?"

Their easy banter sent shockwaves through the crowd.

Alexander Kingsley's eyes narrowed. That impeccable suit she'd gifted him suddenly made sense. Even his veteran tailor couldn't match that craftsmanship. He'd underestimated her - severely.

A mentor to international designers? That wasn't just impressive. That was elite. How many in the country held such prestige?

Three years. Three damn years she'd hidden this from him. Why? What else had she concealed during their farce of a marriage?

"Ms. Dubois," Isabella stepped forward, hand extended. "I'm Mr. Kingsley's fiancée, Isabella Sinclair—"

Camille recoiled, pulling Natalia back. "Your name isn't on my guest list."

Isabella's smile faltered.

"Don't know how you got an invitation," Camille continued icily. "Private event. No outsiders. Kindly leave."

Isabella's face drained of color. Humiliation burned her cheeks as she clutched Alexander's sleeve.

"Ms. Dubois," Alexander's voice remained measured. "We meant no disrespect. My fiancée admires your work. A simple misunderstanding."

Natalia's nails dug into her palms. The great Alexander Kingsley, lowering himself for Isabella. She'd once foolishly believed she could earn that devotion.

Isabella clung to Alexander, victory flashing behind her demure mask.

Camille studied Alexander. "Since you ask so nicely, Mr. Kingsley, you may stay." Her gaze shifted. "Your companion leaves."

Isabella's jaw dropped. "You can't separate us! I'm his fiancée!"

"Wouldn't have guessed," Camille deadpanned.

Isabella saw red.

"Mr. Kingsley stays because he's aesthetically pleasing," Camille continued. "Excellent sartorial taste. Fits the ambiance." She eyed Isabella's ensemble with distaste. "You, however, offend my professional sensibilities. Exit stage left."

Natalia facepalmed. Right. Camille's notorious weakness for handsome men.

Alexander's jaw tightened. "Ms. Dubois, that's unnecessarily harsh."

"Harsh?" Camille's laugh held no mirth. "Your fiancée publicly insulted my mentor. I'm showing remarkable restraint."

The room held its breath.

Natalia's eyes widened. So Camille knew about the earlier confrontation. Warmth flooded her chest.

Isabella's grip on Alexander turned desperate. Her earlier bravado had evaporated.

"Enough," Natalia murmured. "Don't spoil the evening."

She addressed the crowd. "No harm done. Everything Ms. Sterling said was technically true. My background is humble. Nothing to dispute."

Murmurs of sympathy rippled through the guests.

"Look at her grace! True nobility isn't about pedigree."

"Plenty of designers rose from nothing. Petty to throw that in someone's face."

"Is that really Alexander Kingsley's choice? More mistress material than future wife."

"Questionable judgment, Mr. Kingsley."

Isabella's teeth ground together. The whispers scalded her pride. She wanted to flee, but Alexander stood rooted, tension radiating from his clenched fists.

He'd endure this humiliation. Needed to see what other surprises Natalia had tucked up her sleeve.
###Chapter 83

The moment the last guest departed, Camille whisked Isabella into her private studio. Their laughter echoed through the space, an intimate bubble of joy only they shared.

Camille prepared Colombian coffee with practiced hands, pairing it with exquisite pastries from Parisian master chefs. These were delicacies reserved solely for special occasions - and Isabella was always special.

"Try this blend."

Isabella lifted the cup with elegant fingers, her aristocratic upbringing evident in every movement. "The nutty undertones are exquisite. A perfect balance."

"Only the best for you." Camille's usually aloof expression melted into girlish delight around her mentor.

Their bond traced back six years. Camille, then a rising star in fashion, faced brutal industry backlash after a televised humiliation by a famous actress. When all seemed lost, the legendary designer Haron publicly defended her.

Haron's intervention sparked a movement. Other wronged designers spoke out. The actress was exposed for multiple scandals, her career crumbling overnight. Camille's talent finally received its due recognition.

"Master, why won't you reveal you're Haron?" Camille refilled Isabella's cup, curiosity burning in her eyes. "The world deserves to know your genius."

Isabella massaged her temples with a wry smile. "The spotlight suffocates me. I prefer creating in peace."

"But if that Acacia knew who you really were-" Camille's hands clenched. "How dare she mock you just because she's engaged to Alexander? The arrogance!"

A playful glint entered Isabella's eyes as she sipped her coffee. "She's not worthy of knowing Haron."

"Master, why tolerate her? Let me teach her a lesson!"

Isabella's smile faltered slightly. "No need. She'll be Mrs. Kingsley soon."

"I don't care whose fiancée she is! No one insults my mentor!" Camille declared fiercely.

Guilt pricked Isabella's heart. Despite their closeness, Camille knew nothing of her true identity - heiress to the Sinclair empire, Alexander Kingsley's ex-wife. Sometimes Isabella felt like living multiple lives, each identity carefully compartmentalized.

"Master, remember your promise?" Camille held up a heart-shaped macaron, eyes sparkling.

"Of course. But if this dance partner isn't tall, handsome, and an exceptional dancer, I'm walking out," Isabella teased.

"Wait till you see him! Tall, muscular, with smoldering eyes - perfection!"

Meanwhile, Alexander stood like a statue amidst the lingering guests, his tailored suit accentuating his powerful frame. Every woman's gaze lingered on him, much to Acacia's irritation.

If not for commissioning her wedding dress, Acacia would never have risked bringing her fiancé to such an event. These social vultures were practically undressing him with their eyes!

Alexander ignored the attention, his piercing gaze scanning the room for one person.

"There she is!" Acacia spotted Camille reentering and tugged Alexander's sleeve. "Darling, use your influence. Make her design my dress! Money is no object!"

Alexander allowed himself to be dragged forward, his expression unreadable.

"Ms. Camille," Acacia simpered, clinging to Alexander's arm. "We'd be honored if you designed my wedding dress. Our ceremony will be televised nationally - imagine the exposure for your brand! Name your price."

Camille arched an eyebrow. "Ten million dollars."

Acacia gasped. "That's outrageous!"

"Funny," Camille smirked. "I thought money was no object for the future Mrs. Kingsley?"

"I'll pay it," Alexander stated coolly.

"Darling!" Acacia's lips trembled.

"You could afford it," Camille said sweetly. "But I won't do it."

Alexander's jaw tightened.

"My mentor might forgive slights, but I don't. Ms. Acacia, consider yourself blacklisted from Rozabe. No wedding dress. No future commissions. Nothing."

With that, Camille turned on her heel and vanished into the crowd.

Acacia's nails dug into her palms. "Alexander, did that Isabella woman poison her against us? This is so unfair!"

"I'll speak with Isabella later," Alexander muttered distractedly.

Just as Acacia leaned in for a kiss, the lights dimmed. A spotlight illuminated the stage as sultry tango music filled the air. A male dancer appeared, then -

Alexander's breath caught.

There stood Isabella in a crimson dress that clung to every curve, radiating confidence as she took center stage.

Gasps rippled through the crowd. "Is that the same woman from earlier? She's breathtaking!"

"Such raw passion in her movements! Absolutely mesmerizing!"

Alexander watched, stunned, as his ex-wife moved with sensual grace. Since when did she dance? The woman he'd married couldn't tell a waltz from a cha-cha.

And that dress - how dare she wear something so revealing in public! How dare that man touch her waist! Just because they were divorced didn't mean she could abandon all propriety!

His gaze burned as it traced the slit revealing her toned legs. The tango's intimate choreography showed Isabella at her most provocative - her smoldering eyes locking with Alexander's across the room.

As the music swelled, Isabella wrapped herself around her partner like silk, her arms encircling his waist. Her challenging stare never left Alexander's face.

Something primal stirred within him. He fought the urge to storm the stage, throw the dancer aside, and wrap Isabella in his jacket.

Even as her husband, he'd never been granted such intimacy. The thought of another man touching what was once his made his blood boil.
###Chapter 84

The final notes of the music faded as Isabella Sinclair gracefully concluded her dance, dipping into a flawless curtsy with her partner. Though this was merely an intimate gathering among friends, her mesmerizing performance had transformed the room into a grand ballroom.

Across the room, Victoria Sterling's grip tightened around her coffee cup as she overheard the murmurs of admiration for Isabella. Memories surfaced of her own glory days - when she'd been celebrated as both a songbird and prima ballerina, her trophy case overflowing with awards. But years spent chasing wealthy men across Europe had dulled her talents, leaving only hollowed-out skills in their place.

"Alexander," Victoria purred, "don't you think Isabella's being rather...indecent? Dancing like that, dressed so provocatively in public? I'd be mortified—" Her words died as she turned to find Alexander Kingsley's seat empty.

Alexander stormed down the backstage corridor, his mind replaying Isabella's hypnotic movements against his will. His throat burned with a thirst he refused to name as emotion. This was anger, he told himself - nothing more. Justifiable fury at her constant defiance and deception.

Then he heard it.

"That woman I danced with tonight - her waist was so delicate in my hands! Like holding spun glass!" A male voice gushed from around the corner. "Most thrilling partner I've ever had!"

The words detonated in Alexander's skull.

The unsuspecting dancer barely had time to turn before Alexander's military-honed fist connected with his jaw.

"AGH—!"

The man crumpled to the floor, writhing in pain.

"Who gave you permission to touch her?" Alexander's voice dropped to arctic temperatures as he loomed over the groaning man. "Who do you think you are?"

"M-Mr. Kingsley?!" The dancer's eyes bulged in terror. "But you're engaged to Ms. Sterling! I didn't realize Ms. Sinclair was—"

Mentioning Victoria was his fatal mistake. Alexander's expression darkened further.

"Alexander! What the hell?"

He whirled to find Isabella and Camille Dubois rushing toward them, their heels clicking sharply against the marble. The dancer scrambled toward the women, blood dripping from his split lip.

"Attacking my guests at my event?" Camille jabbed an accusatory finger at Alexander. "Explain yourself!"

"I didn't care for his commentary." Alexander flexed his stinging knuckles. "Consider this an educational moment about appropriate conversation."

Isabella stared, stunned. The Alexander she knew maintained icy composure always - never brawled with random men. Had he lost his mind?

"Explain. Now." Camille rounded on the trembling dancer.

"I-I meant no offense to Ms. Sinclair! I just told a friend how wonderful it was to dance with her—" The man cradled his jaw. "Then Mr. Kingsley just...attacked me!"

"Enough." Isabella sliced her hand through the air. "Camille, take him to get medical attention."

"I'm not leaving you alone with him!" Camille hissed, eyeing Alexander like a rabid animal. "The man's clearly unhinged. Probably bipolar!"

"Noted." Isabella's gaze remained glacial. "But the mess belongs to its maker. Don't worry - he wouldn't dare lay a finger on me."

Alexander heard every whispered word. His jaw clenched.

Though visibly reluctant, Camille helped the injured dancer away, leaving suffocating silence in their wake.

Alexander's gaze raked over Isabella's crimson dress - the same one that had clung to her curves during their dance. The dancer's words echoed in his skull. Without a word, he shrugged off his suit jacket and thrust it at her.

"Put this on."

SMACK! Isabella knocked it from his hands, the fabric pooling on the floor between them. "First assault, now this? Are you deliberately trying to provoke me?"

"Isabella!" Alexander's pupils contracted violently.

"I know you prefer your women demure and docile like Victoria. Newsflash - I'm done playing the good girl. Three years of that charade was more than enough." Isabella's glare could have melted steel. "We're divorced, Alexander. What I wear, how I dance, who touches me - none of it concerns you, especially when you're engaged to another woman!"

"So now that you're free of me, you'll just throw yourself at any man?" Alexander's face paled with fury. "Must you dress like a common—"

Isabella's sudden laughter cut him off. "Oh my God. Alexander Kingsley, are you jealous?"

"Don't be absurd." His pulse hammered against his ribs.

She stepped into his space, tilting her face up to his. "If you don't want me, why do you care? Or..." Her lips curved. "Is this just possessive rage because another man appreciates what you took for granted?"

"Possessive?" Alexander recoiled.

"What else would you call this tantrum?"

Her smile vanished. "Have some dignity. Go find your fiancée. Skulking around with your ex-wife behind her back? Now that's truly disgraceful." She turned to leave, the red silk of her dress swirling around her legs.

Alexander's hand shot out, fingers clamping around her wrist hard enough to bruise. She gasped, struggling against his iron grip.

"If you have issues with me, address them directly," he growled. "Using others to get at me? Pathetic."

"Using—what?" Isabella blinked, genuinely baffled.

"Victoria came to Camille for a dress design. Instead of assistance, she got humiliation." Alexander's grip tightened. "You expect me to believe you weren't behind that? That this wasn't some petty revenge scheme?"

The accusation hung between them like a guillotine's blade.
###Chapter 85

16:40

Thaddeus's words hung in the air, even startling himself. He had no proof, yet he'd assumed the worst of Evadne. A part of him wanted her to be that kind of person—as if it would validate his lingering significance in her heart.

"Thaddeus," Evadne laughed softly, though her chest ached. "Are you perhaps a little too full of yourself?"

She tilted her head, her smile sharp. "Honestly, revenge never crossed my mind. Whether you married Acacia or pulled an Emeric and took four wives, I wouldn’t care. Hating you? That’s the most pointless thing in the world."

The words hit Thaddeus like a physical blow. His jaw tightened. "Evadne—"

"Camille’s orders are booked solid until next year. She doesn’t bend her rules for anyone—not even the leader’s wife." Evadne’s tone was light, teasing, but her eyes were dull, devoid of their usual fire. "If I really wanted revenge, I wouldn’t need Camille. I could’ve just slapped Acacia a few times and called it a day. You really don’t know me at all, do you?"

Thaddeus flinched. That emptiness in her gaze—it hurt more than he expected.

"Evadne!"

A familiar voice cut through the tension.

Cassius.

Evadne seized the chance to step back, nearly jogging toward him. Cassius caught her effortlessly, his arms wrapping around her in a protective embrace. "Sorry I’m late," he murmured, pressing a kiss to her temple.

"It’s fine." Her voice was small, eyes glistening.

Cassius shot Thaddeus a warning look. "Did he do anything to you?"

Evadne shook her head. "Let’s just go home."

Thaddeus stood frozen, watching as they walked away. Then, like a man possessed, he followed.

Outside, Jason waited by the Rolls-Royce, ever the loyal shadow.

"Ugh, these heels are killing me," Evadne groaned, leaning into Cassius. "Sneakers are so much better."

"Jason," Cassius ordered without hesitation.

The bodyguard retrieved a pair of pristine sneakers from the trunk and knelt to place them at Evadne’s feet.

Thaddeus reached the doorway just in time to see Cassius kneel, gently removing her heels and sliding on the sneakers, tying the laces with meticulous care. The sight twisted something inside him.

Evadne plucked a piece of chocolate from Jason’s pocket, popping it into her mouth with a satisfied hum. "Let’s go home."

Cassius helped her into the car, and within seconds, they were gone.

Leaving Thaddeus standing there, chest hollow, an unfamiliar ache spreading through him.

His ex-wife—the woman who once waited for him in that cold, empty mansion—was now being cherished like royalty. Cassius, a man of status and pride, willingly knelt for her, his love evident in every gesture.

True love meant never letting her bend down to tie her own shoes.

And it burned Thaddeus to witness it.

That night, Acacia clung to Thaddeus’s arm as they returned to Windermere Estate, her voice dripping with false concern. "You left me alone earlier. I was so nervous..."

Thaddeus peeled her fingers away, his tone icy. "Acacia."

Her eyes widened, lips trembling. "What’s wrong?"

"In the future, if Evadne doesn’t provoke you, don’t seek her out."

Acacia’s face paled. "You think I’m the one bullying her?"

"Isn’t that the case?" His gaze was unyielding. "She didn’t do anything to you today."

Acacia’s nails dug into her palms. "Thaddeus—"

"After Grandfather’s birthday, once the divorce is finalized, we’ll have no ties to her." His voice was final. "Stop making scenes. That’s all I ask."

The rest of the ride was silent.

At the estate, Thaddeus stormed upstairs without another word, leaving Acacia seething.

Half an hour later, dressed in fresh clothes, he descended the stairs—only to freeze at the sound of laughter from the living room.

Glynnis’s voice carried, laced with disdain. "We need a new chef. The food’s been unbearable since Evadne left. Who knew that country girl could actually cook?"

Acacia giggled. "She cooked for you every day?"

"Of course," Glynnis sneered. "It was the only way she could justify staying in this family. The maids called her the ‘high-class nanny.’"

Elspeth sighed dramatically. "I thought she’d leave after a year, with how cold Thaddeus was. But no—she endured three years of humiliation. Pathetic."

Glynnis snorted. "Thank God Acacia’s back. Otherwise, that leech would’ve clung to us forever."

Thaddeus’s hands clenched into fists.

"Have you quite finished?" His voice cut through the room like a blade.

Silence.

Acacia jumped up, forcing a smile. "Thaddeus, we were just—"

"Grateful?" He scoffed, eyes blazing. "You’ve been benefiting from Evadne’s kindness for years, and this is how you repay her? Mocking her behind her back?"

Elspeth and Glynnis blanched.

"Evadne was my wife," he growled. "I won’t tolerate disrespect toward her—not from anyone in this family."

The women shrank under his glare.

With that, he turned on his heel and stormed back upstairs, leaving them in stunned silence.

Acacia’s fists trembled.

Evadne. Always Evadne.

Even now, divorced and gone, she still haunted them.

And Thaddeus—he was still under her spell.
###Chapter 86

Isabella Sinclair sat curled on the sofa, pressing her fingers against her pounding temples. The muscles in her shoulders trembled from the tension radiating through her body. The migraine had started during the car ride home, but listening to their cruel words had intensified the pain tenfold.

Noble blood...lowly status...Even if she wasn't perfect, who gave them the right to judge?

"Mr. Sinclair! Is your headache back? Let me get your medication!" Olivia Bennett rushed to the cabinet, retrieving the painkillers before pouring a glass of warm water.

The pills brought slight relief, allowing some color to return to his ashen face.

"Mr. Sinclair, you can't keep relying on these. They have terrible side effects." Olivia hesitated before adding, "I remember Ms. Isabella used to massage your pressure points. It always helped. Should we...ask her to come back?"

"Olivia." Nathan's voice cracked, his bloodshot eyes lifting to meet hers. "Did they always speak about Isabella that way? They said she cooked for the Sinclair family for three years...Is that true?"

"Yes, Mr. Sinclair. I've told you before how dedicated Ms. Isabella was, but you thought it was an act. Who could keep up a charade for three years straight? If it was fake, she deserves an Oscar for that performance!"

Nathan's lips pressed into a thin, pale line.

"When Ms. Isabella first arrived, her cooking was barely edible. She begged me for lessons, even though I told her we had chefs for that. She insisted a wife should handle household duties—that since she couldn't help with your work, she wanted to contribute in other ways."

"At first, the kitchen smoke made her cough so badly she needed a mask. But she persisted. Every morning, she'd be cooking before I even woke up."

Coughing? An allergy to smoke?

Nathan suddenly found it hard to breathe, the painkillers doing nothing for the vise tightening around his chest.

Olivia exhaled sharply. "I've had enough of Victoria and her daughter. After everything Ms. Isabella sacrificed for this family, they mock her? Disgusting!"

"Mr. Sinclair, as much as I want you two to reconcile, remembering how Ms. Isabella suffered here breaks my heart. She deserves a family that appreciates her, not one that stabs her in the back with gossip."

Words could cut deeper than any blade.

Nathan felt like he'd been struck, his brows knitting together.

Days passed quietly until Mr. Hamilton's birthday approached.

With divorce papers imminent, Isabella's emotions were in turmoil. Their marriage had been a rushed registry office affair—no ceremony, no celebration.

In their wedding photo, she'd leaned toward him with radiant joy while he stood stiffly, his expression colder than a winter morning.

She'd believed time and effort could bridge the distance between them. Now she knew—love was the one thing no amount of determination could conjure.

It wasn't that Isabella hadn't tried hard enough for Nathan. Some chasms were simply too wide to cross.

"Ms. Isabella, here are the wedding plans for Amelia that the events team worked on overnight." Daniel placed the folder before her. She picked up a pen, scanning the documents with a critical eye.

"These sections need complete revisions. These designs are five years outdated. And the color scheme is wrong—Amelia detests bright tones. Use more muted Morandi palettes. Redo it." Her pen slashed across the pages.

"Understood, Ms. Isabella."

"We'll begin full preparations after Grandfather's birthday. I want everyone's A-game—no excuses for mediocrity."

"Of course! We won't let Nathan show us up!"

Isabella scoffed. "I hate losing, but this has nothing to do with Nathan. Though if he wants a competition, I'll show him what ruthless really looks like."

Her phone buzzed—Vanessa calling.

"Vanessa, what's the news?"

"Ms. Isabella! Mission accomplished!"

Isabella blinked. "Pardon?"

"I've secured the Dante Chair from your father!" Vanessa's triumphant laughter filled the line.

"Vanessa, you're incredible! I owe you for this!"

"Happy to help, as long as you're happy."

"But what if Father finds out? You'll be in trouble."

Vanessa's voice turned cavalier. "Don't sweat it. Worst case, just pick out a nice headstone for me."

Isabella rolled her eyes.

That evening, Daniel drove Isabella back to the villa. She kicked off her heels, slipping into plush velvet slippers before heading upstairs to shower.

"Ms. Isabella, shall I draw your bath?"

"No need. Just make something simple for dinner. I can manage the rest."

"What would you like?"

"Spaghetti bolognese."

Yawning, Isabella disappeared upstairs.

Daniel tidied the living room before donning an apron to cook. Just as he finished, the doorbell rang.

Only he, Isabella, Sebastian, and Nathaniel had keys. They never rang—they just walked in.

Who could it be at this hour? Who else knew Isabella lived here?

Frowning, Daniel checked the video feed—and froze.

Nathaniel Kingsley's arrogant smirk filled the screen.

"Hello? Anyone home?" He peered closer.

"Mr. Kingsley? What are you doing here?" Daniel's voice turned icy.

"Me? I followed you." Nathaniel grinned like a mischievous schoolboy.

"Since when?!"

"Since you left the hotel. Honestly, for a secretary, your situational awareness is pathetic. Didn't even notice you had a tail."

Daniel took a steadying breath. "Ms. Isabella has retired for the evening. Please leave."

"Her bedroom light's still on. I brought a gift—at least let me deliver it before kicking me out, yeah?"

"Daniel, who's there?"

Isabella emerged in a silk robe, damp hair wrapped in a towel, steam still clinging to her skin.

"It's...it's—"

She leaned toward the screen, arching a brow. "Oh. You."

"Isabella! It's me!" Nathaniel's face lit up like Christmas morning.

"What do you want?"

"I brought you something! Since I missed you today, I wanted to deliver it personally!"

"Mr. Kingsley, I've told you—I don't accept gifts. The gesture is appreciated."

"But this is a crystal sculpture by Manet of Helgen! Do you know how hard these are to acquire—"

Manet? Isabella's lips parted. She hit the door release.

Daniel massaged his temples.

Once again, Nathaniel had found the perfect bait.
###Chapter 87

The door stood ajar. With hurried movements betraying his fear that Isabella might reconsider, Lucas slipped inside.

"Ms. Sinclair, visiting your place always feels like navigating a minefield. Brutal!"

His eyes drank in the sight of the woman illuminated by soft lighting. The silk robe clung to her curves like liquid moonlight. That rosy flush on her cheeks? Absolutely mesmerizing.

Lucas had to consciously remember to breathe.

"Mr. Grant, your staring is becoming rather inappropriate." Sebastian observed icily.

"Appreciating beauty is human nature. I'm merely admiring a masterpiece without any ulterior motives." Lucas flashed an easy grin.

His excuse was so absurd it bordered on comical.

"So, is this Henri's latest creation?" Isabella's gaze locked onto the box in his arms.

"Indeed. Acquired two - one for Reginald's birthday, and this special one just for you."

Lucas' eyes sparkled with barely contained excitement. "Isabella, Henri only crafts ten pieces annually. Each one's practically a national treasure!"

She cleared her throat delicately. "Have you dined? Care to join me if not?"

"Starving! Been camped outside The Chateau Royale since dawn. My stomach's digesting itself!" Lucas' voice trembled with theatrical hunger.

Sebastian rolled his eyes so hard it's a miracle they didn't get stuck.

"Sebastian, prepare Mr. Grant some spaghetti Bolognese." Isabella commanded while accepting the box, already moving toward the sitting area.

"Perhaps Mr. Grant finds our hospitality lacking." Sebastian seized the opportunity. "Our humble cooking might not meet your refined palate."

"Nonsense! Who said that? Lies! I'll devour anything you make!" Lucas clutched his chest as if wounded.

While Sebastian cooked, Isabella and Lucas examined Henri's creation in the parlor. The crystal fan unfolded like frozen water, its intricate latticework carved from a single flawless quartz. Static yet alive with movement.

"Exquisite..." Isabella breathed, fingertips hovering above the sculpture. The piece seemed to glow under her touch.

Lucas' gaze snagged on her hands - more delicate than the artwork itself, rendering the priceless fan dull by comparison.

"You like it?" Lucas tilted his head, studying her reaction.

"Immensely. Henri's craftsmanship is peerless." Joy radiated from her like sunlight.

"Me too..."

"Thank you, Mr. Grant. This was thoughtful." Her expression sobered. "But I can't accept such generosity. Name your price."

"Isabella, you're breaking my heart." Lucas pressed a hand to his chest dramatically.

"I've coveted Henri's work for years. Planned a trip to Paris just to acquire one. Your timing is impeccable." She smiled. "Let's make this transactional - you're compensated, I'm satisfied. I dislike debts."

"Absolutely not!"

"Then state your terms. Within reason."

Lucas' face lit up. He leaned closer. "Reginald's birthday gala next week. Accompany me?"

"Choose differently."

"You just agreed to terms!"

"Impossible." Her gaze turned serious. "I've promised Alexander I'd attend as his granddaughter-in-law. After this, our ties sever. Arriving with another man would disrespect him. I want his final birthday with me to be... peaceful."

Something vulnerable flickered in her eyes.

"You're too good for that fool." Lucas sighed, then realized without his friend's idiocy, he'd never have met this remarkable woman.

"New terms then." She traced the fan's edge lovingly.

"Stop calling me 'Mr. Grant'? Something... friendlier?" He looked absurdly hopeful.

"That's all? I rarely grant such requests."

"Dining with you is prize enough!" Lucas' gaze turned molten.

"Lucas it is, then."

"Yes! Just Lucas!" His heart hammered against his ribs.

This felt like progress. To him, his given name from her lips might as well mean 'darling'.

"Miss, dinner's served."

Sebastian reappeared, apron-clad. His demeanor toward Isabella: gentle. Toward Lucas: glacial. "Added extra chili to his portion."

Here's hoping Lucas couldn't handle spice!

16:44

"Isabella, isn't a male housekeeper... unconventional? Our family maid - fifteen years of service, exceptional cook. Want me to arrange an introduction?" Lucas smirked at Sebastian.

Sebastian's grip crumpled the apron.

Lucas mentally scoffed. Who did this glorified assistant think he was?

"Sebastian and I grew up together. He stays." Her voice turned arctic. "Mr. Grant, isn't your family preoccupied with that pipeline acquisition?"

Sebastian warmed at her defense.

Lucas nearly choked. This 'housekeeper' was her childhood friend? And Alexander allowed this man near his woman? Was this some twisted display of confidence?

"Wait in the dining room. I'll join after storing this." Carefully repacking the artwork, Isabella ascended the stairs, steps light as a sparrow.

Lucas couldn't resist snapping a photo of her retreating form. Even candid, the shot belonged in a gallery.

His phone buzzed. Alexander - in one of his moods, demanding drinks. Smugness overtook Lucas. He sent the photo.

Two seconds later, his phone rang.

"Hello?" Lucas turned, lowering his voice.

Alexander's tone could freeze hell over. "You're with Isabella now?"

"Not just with her. In her home." Lucas gloated.

"Where does she live?!" The growl sent shivers down spines.

"You don't even know your ex-wife's address? Pathetic. Clearly she doesn't want you knowing."

"Last chance. Location."

Lucas laughed. "Make me."

16:44
###Chapter 88

Alexander Kingsley's sports car screeched to a halt outside Isabella Sinclair's villa. Through the rain-streaked window, he could see the golden glow of interior lights. The thought of Lucas Grant inside with her made his chest constrict like a vice.

His fingers tightened around the phone. The screen displayed a photo of Isabella in a scandalous silk negligee, her curves barely concealed. A far cry from the modest cotton dresses she used to wear during their marriage.

Now divorced, she'd transformed into a siren. Every man in the city was under her spell.

Alexander loosened his tie with a sharp tug, his breathing ragged.

Inside the villa...

Lucas watched Isabella devour her spaghetti with growing horror. Raised in luxury, he'd never touched such common food before. His first taste of alcohol had been vintage champagne at fifteen. Fast food? Unthinkable.

"Aren't you eating? It's getting cold," Isabella remarked between bites.

"I'm... overwhelmed by your hospitality," Lucas stammered, picking at his food like it might bite back.

"It's just pasta. I've got a whole pantry full. Take some home if you like."

"No! Absolutely not!"

Gritting his teeth, Lucas shoveled a forkful into his mouth. Fire exploded on his tongue. Tears sprang to his eyes as the spices burned his throat. Across the table, Sebastian Bennett smirked behind his water glass.

"Can't handle heat? You should've said something earlier." Isabella pushed a glass toward him just as the doorbell chimed.

Sebastian checked the monitor. His blood ran cold when Alexander's face appeared.

"I'm here for Isabella."

"Sebastian, who is it?"

Isabella and a still-coughing Lucas appeared in the hallway. Both froze at the sight on screen.

"You told him?" Isabella's glare could have melted steel.

"He threatened me!" Lucas wheezed, clutching his burning throat. "Said he'd cut ties unless I gave your address. And worse..."

"What worse?"

"That he'd never finalize the divorce. As long as you're legally married, neither I nor Nathaniel can be with you."

The audacity!

Isabella's fists clenched until her knuckles turned white. She shoved Sebastian aside and faced the intercom. "You have no right to be here. Leave now or I'm calling security."

"Isabella. Come out." Alexander's voice crackled through the speaker, edged with danger.

She laughed bitterly. "Since when do I take orders from you?"

"Lucas. Out. Now." Alexander's eyes burned through the screen.

"Not happening." Lucas knew that tone - and it terrified him.

"Lucas!"

"He's my guest," Isabella cut in coldly. "You're the unwelcome one here, Mr. Kingsley. Goodbye."

The screen went dark, but Alexander's furious expression lingered. Using their divorce as leverage? Pathetic. Did he really think paperwork could chain her forever?

"I'm sorry," Lucas sniffled, eyes watering from the spices. "I shouldn't have told him—"

"Not your fault." Isabella exhaled sharply. "This is all Alexander's doing. He can't stand seeing me move on."

Lucas swallowed hard. Normally women trembled before him. But Isabella's anger? Terrifying.

Thunder rumbled outside as the storm intensified.

"Let's finish dinner." Isabella stormed back to the table.

Lucas lingered, staring at the door. Holy hell. That fire in her eyes... was this the real Isabella?

Rain hammered against the floor-to-ceiling windows as they sipped coffee later.

"I misjudged you," Isabella admitted. "You're kinder than I expected."

"Me? Kind?" Lucas nearly choked on his drink. "Isabella Sinclair just complimented me? I'm having that engraved on my tombstone!"

"Don't make me regret it." She smirked.

Taking a chance, Lucas inched closer. "If... if we'd met before Alexander, would you have given me a chance?"

"No." The answer came like a guillotine.

"Why?" Ice water couldn't have chilled him faster.

"My heart belonged to Alexander. Without him, there's no room for anyone else." Her reflection in the rain-streaked glass looked decades older than her twenty-four years.

Thirteen years of love, marriage, and heartbreak had drained her. The vibrant girl who'd loved so fiercely was gone, leaving only this hollowed-out version.

Lucas's chest ached. Alexander Kingsley, you absolute fool.

"Miss!" Sebastian burst in. "You need to see this."

He led her to a side window. Isabella's breath caught.

Alexander stood like a statue in the downpour, his designer suit plastered to his body. Rain streamed down his face, but his gaze never wavered.

"Is he insane?" Sebastian hissed. "This some pathetic guilt trip?"

"More manipulative than ever." Isabella's nails dug into her palms. "Let him drown for all I care."

Her phone vibrated. Alexander's name flashed on screen. Against her better judgment, she answered. "What now?"

"Come out. We need to talk." His voice cut through the storm's roar.

"We have nothing to—"

A lightning bolt split the sky, illuminating her pale face with electric horror.
###Chapter 89

The storm raged violently, lightning splitting the sky apart. Isabella remembered—Nathaniel was standing right beneath a tree! And to make it worse, he was calling her in this weather. Was he trying to get himself killed?

"Nathaniel, I'm not coming out to see you. Stop calling me and go home now!" Isabella's eyes burned with fury.

"If you don't come out, I won't leave." His voice was deep, unyielding.

"You insane—jerk!" Her face flushed with anger as she cursed under her breath, already heading for the stairs.

"Ms. Sinclair! Ms. Sinclair!"

No matter how hard Jason called after her, he couldn't stop her.

Nathaniel gripped his phone tightly, brows furrowed. His gaze remained fixed on the villa's gate, unwavering. Finally, the gate swung open.

A spark ignited in his eyes, his breath hitching.

Isabella, wrapped in a coat and clutching a large umbrella, strode toward him. The wind howled, tossing her hair wildly. Her body swayed dangerously, as if she might be swept away at any second. Yet her expression remained unshaken—cold, defiant.

Nathaniel was struck by a strange sense of familiarity. Those eyes, gleaming like stars in the dark—had he seen them somewhere before?

She stopped before him, unflinching. She was a Sinclair, raised by four formidable brothers, daughter to the wealthiest man in New York. She was accustomed to controlling destinies. Since when did she let a man dictate her emotions?

"Nathaniel, have you lost your mind? Do you have a death wish, standing under a tree in this storm?" The angrier she got, the more she wanted to strangle him.

His eyes narrowed slightly. "Do you care about me?"

Care?

Isabella scoffed. "Don't flatter yourself. I only came out because I don’t want you causing a scene at my doorstep. I refuse to let you dirty my property."

Her words were sharp, meant to wound. Yet Nathaniel found this version of her—fiery, unyielding—far more captivating than the hollow woman she'd pretended to be.

Curiosity was the beginning of everything.

"Get in the car. We'll talk there." His gaze flickered to her rain-soaked clothes.

"No." She crossed her arms. "Say whatever you need to say right here, right now."

"Get. In. The. Car." His tone brooked no argument.

Just then—

A blinding streak of purple lightning tore through the sky.

A deafening crack echoed as a thick branch snapped and plummeted toward them.

The rain drowned out all sound. Isabella, focused solely on Nathaniel, didn’t notice the danger until it was too late.

"Look out!"

Before she could react, a wave of heat rushed toward her. Nathaniel moved faster, his strong arms wrapping around her, shielding her completely as the branch crashed onto his back.

A pained groan escaped his lips, but his grip on her didn’t loosen. Isabella’s heart hammered violently. "Nathaniel! Are you okay?"

"I'm fine. Get in the car." His jaw clenched as he dragged her toward the vehicle, ignoring the searing pain.

The rain poured relentlessly, but Isabella was too stunned to resist as he practically shoved her inside.

The car’s interior was dim, the scent of damp fabric and heated breaths filling the space. Nathaniel shrugged off his soaked suit jacket, tossing it aside. His dark hair clung to his forehead, disheveled yet undeniably attractive.

Isabella’s pulse still hadn’t steadied. That embrace—so sudden, so secure.

Three years of marriage, and he’d never held her like that. Was this how Victoria felt every day?

The thought twisted her lips into a bitter smile. No matter how safe his arms felt, they weren’t hers.

"Did Alexander buy this villa for you?" Nathaniel’s voice cut through her thoughts, cold.

"Why do you care?" She turned away, staring out the rain-streaked window. "Do I look like I can afford a place like this? Of course it was President Sinclair’s generous gift."

"If you needed a place to stay, why didn’t you take the one I offered after the divorce?" Anger seeped into his tone, overriding the pain in his back.

"Why would I?" Her lips curled mockingly. "Accepting his gifts is expected. But yours? That would’ve been pathetic. A transaction, nothing more. I never touched a cent of your money during our marriage, and I won’t start now."

"Isabella, I wasn’t trying to humiliate you." His voice lowered, frustration simmering beneath.

He’d given her the money thinking she, coming from a modest background, might struggle in the city alone. It was the only thing he could offer.

"Enough. If you came here to dredge up the past, I’m not interested. I’m leaving."

She reached for the door handle.

Nathaniel’s hand shot out, gripping her wrist and yanking her back.

Isabella gasped as she collided with his chest—hard.

It hurt. How was his body so unyielding? Like solid steel.

"Sorry." His voice was rough, sending an unwelcome shiver down her spine.

She blinked up at him, startled.

"You... what?"

He cleared his throat, suddenly awkward. "About that incident. I’m apologizing on Victoria’s behalf. She shouldn’t have spoken to you like that in public."

Instantly, her blood turned to ice.

"So you stood in the rain just to apologize for your fiancée?" Her laugh was hollow. "How noble. But I don’t accept it."
###Chapter 90

"Why?" Nathaniel's brows furrowed, tension flickering in his gaze.

He had no idea how long he'd spent psyching himself up to say I'm sorry. A whole damn week without sleep!

He'd planned to apologize to her at his grandfather's birthday dinner, but after seeing Dominic strut into her house tonight, he realized he couldn't wait another second. He needed to see her—now.

He didn’t understand this urgency. He’d never felt anything like it before.

His emotions had always been controlled, precise. But right now, he was starting to realize—the switch controlling them wasn’t in his hands anymore. It was in hers.

"If anyone should apologize, it should be Victoria herself. What are you doing, playing the gallant knight for her? Trying to flaunt your perfect little romance?"

Isabella's voice was ice. "If she murdered someone, would you take the blame for her too?"

"Isabella, I’m here to apologize to you—sincerely!" Nathaniel's voice cracked, his eyes burning.

"I think you’re just here to piss me off." Isabella let out a bitter laugh, her gaze sharp as shattered glass. "Nathaniel, if you don’t understand the meaning of sorry, don’t use the word. You’ll only taint it."

"Isabella, are you trying to pick a fight with me?" His tone darkened.

"You’re the one who showed up uninvited. I didn’t ask for this. You came here to make yourself miserable."

She yanked her wrist free, wincing at the pain. "Let go. I’m going home."

"Even if I’m apologizing for Victoria, so what? I still apologized! What more do you want?!" Nathaniel snapped, gripping her shoulders hard enough to bruise.

"Nathaniel, what I wanted was never an apology from you."

What she’d truly wanted was his love. But she’d accepted long ago that she’d never have it. She’d let him go—so why was he still here? Did he think she was that desperate?

A bitter laugh escaped her, tears welling in her eyes.

At that moment, her gaze burned like fire—bright, beautiful, devastating. Nathaniel felt scorched by it, his pulse racing.

"I want you to disappear from my world. Completely. Goodbye. Don’t bother seeing yourself out."

She shoved him away, but he caught her wrist again, his grip iron. "How can I disappear? We were married. You can’t erase divorce from your life like it never happened!"

"I can if I say I can. You may think we’re divorced, but in my eyes, I’m a widow." Her stare was pure contempt, like he was nothing more than dirt beneath her heel.

The words hit him like a physical blow. His head spun, pain lancing through him.

He sucked in a sharp breath, his hand trembling as he growled, "Isabella. I won’t let you go. As long as I don’t sign those papers, you’ll never be free."

Slap!

Tears blurred Isabella’s usually steady gaze. She couldn’t hold back anymore—her palm struck his cheek with a sharp crack.

This was only the second time she’d ever hit him. But the emotions behind it were nothing like the first.

His words had pierced her heart like a blade.

"Nathaniel, if I’d known you were this pathetic, I would’ve never married you in the first place!"

She flung the car door open and bolted toward the mansion, not even bothering with her umbrella. She just needed to get away—far away from him.

Nathaniel sat frozen, his face still turned from the force of her slap.

Minutes passed. His tall frame curled inward, arms wrapping around his pounding head as he trembled, looking utterly broken.

Back inside, Isabella avoided Jason and headed straight for her room.

She barely made it up the stairs before collapsing against the wall, one hand clutching her chest as she gasped for air, fighting back the tears threatening to spill.

Isabella?

Dominic’s voice came from behind her. She bit her lip hard, forcing the tears down. She wouldn’t let him see her like this.

"I’m tired. I need to rest. Thanks for the gift—I’ll see you out another time."

"Isabella, what’s wrong?" His voice was laced with worry.

"I’m fine. Don’t worry about me. Goodnight."

Isabella!

He caught up in two strides, gripping her shoulders and forcing her to face him. The sudden movement made her dizzy, her tear-filled eyes flashing with raw pain.

It only made her more mesmerizing.

"You’ve been crying." His gaze burned into hers.

"No." Her voice was cold, but the redness around her eyes betrayed her.

"Isabella, don’t let Nathaniel get to you. He’s not worth your tears."

"Yeah. Not worth it," she murmured, numb.

Dominic exhaled sharply. Her shattered expression cut deeper than any blade.

"Isabella… why don’t you give me a chance?"

Her brows knitted together.

"Try accepting me. I might not be a saint, but for you—I’d become one."

Couldn’t he measure up? Not even to Nathaniel?

"Dominic, I’m exhausted. Don’t make this harder than it already is." Her voice was hollow.

"Isabella—" His breath hitched, heart aching.

"It’s late. I need sleep. You should go home."

She pushed past him, heading for her room.

"Are you and Sebastian really together? What’s going on between you two? Is this real, or are you just using him to hurt Nathaniel?"

Isabella froze, fists clenching in the shadows. "That’s none of your business."

"There’s no trace of him here. If he’s your boyfriend, why aren’t his things in your house? Why doesn’t it look like he’s ever stayed over?"

"I said—it’s none of your concern. Stay out of my life."

"Isabella! Don’t destroy yourself like this. Don’t do something you’ll regret!" His voice was raw with desperation.

She didn’t answer. Didn’t look back. Just walked away, leaving him standing there.

Nathaniel drove back from Isabella’s place to Windermere Estate. A trip that usually took less than an hour stretched into two.

A splitting headache blurred his vision. The pounding rain made it worse—he nearly crashed twice.

Bursting into his study, he knocked over everything in his path searching for painkillers. When he finally found the bottle, he dry-swallowed double the usual dose.

It didn’t help.

"Nathaniel, if I’d known you were this pathetic, I would’ve never married you in the first place!"

Her words echoed in his skull, relentless. His body curled in agony, sweat soaking his shirt.

Hearing the commotion, Margaret rushed in.

"Mr. Nathaniel! What’s wrong? Is it your migraine again?"

He was barely coherent, slurring, "Isabella… Isabella…"

"Mr. Nathaniel! Hold on—I’m calling the doctor!"

Margaret paled, darting out. Just then, her phone buzzed.

An unknown number.

"Hello?!"

"Margaret. It’s me." A soft voice answered.

"Ms. Isabella?! Is that really you?!" She clapped a hand over her mouth.

"Yes. It’s me."

"Oh, thank God!" Margaret burst into tears. "Please—you have to help him! His migraine’s back, worse than ever! When you were here, they never came this bad. What do I do?!"

"Margaret, listen carefully." Isabella’s voice was steady. "Go to my old room. There’s a silver box in the nightstand drawer—inside are the massage tools I used for his headaches. Under it, you’ll find notes on the pressure points."

"Got it—I’m going now!"

"One more thing. He got hurt tonight—a tree branch hit his back. He’ll pretend it’s nothing, but it’s bad. In the same drawer, there’s ointment. Apply it. If it doesn’t improve in a few days, take him to a doctor."

"Yes, Ms. Isabella." Margaret wiped her eyes, heart aching.

This girl had loved him so deeply. How could he let her go?

"One last request." Isabella paused, then whispered, "Don’t tell him about this call. Please."
###Chapter 91

The following afternoon, Alexander Kingsley finally stirred from sleep. The same haunting dream had plagued him all night.

He found himself back on the battlefield of Zenithia. A brutal mission had been assigned—infiltrating an enemy camp with fifty comrades, eliminating the terrorists, and rescuing ten hostages.

The criminals were heavily armed, ruthless. Among them were barely legal teenagers who had been killing since the age of five.

The sand beneath his boots was soaked in blood, turning the landscape into a living nightmare.

Originally, Alexander hadn’t been on the mission roster. But he’d volunteered, joining the ranks of the Shadowguard Legion without hesitation.

"Young man, are you married?"

"No."

"Then why take this mission? Every man here has a family. If something happens, there’s someone to carry on their name."

At the time, Alexander had simply laughed, indifferent to life or death.

"I have no burdens. Nothing to lose."

The two most important women in his life had left him, one after the other. His heart had shattered beyond repair. Death held no fear for him.

What terrified him more was the loneliness.

By the end, only ten of the fifty survived.

Alexander had been shot in the leg, stabbed in the shoulder and waist. Just as he’d accepted his fate, a woman in a tattered white coat appeared—an angel on the battlefield.

Her mask was thick, her short hair neatly trimmed. Despite the chaos, her eyes shone brighter than the sun and moon combined.

That woman was Seraphina Lockwood. The woman he’d spent years searching for.

And now, after seeing Isabella Sinclair last night, the dream had returned.

Though Isabella and Seraphina were two entirely different people, something in Isabella’s gaze reminded him of her. It unsettled him.

Alexander rubbed his temples, relieved to find the headache gone.

Just then, Margaret Laurent entered with a medical kit.

Seeing him awake and alert, she brightened. "Mr. Kingsley! You’re awake! How are you feeling?"

"Fine."

He tried to sit up, then froze. His clothes had been changed.

"What happened to my outfit?"

"You vanished last night and came back drenched. I changed you into pajamas." She tidied the room briskly. "You’re thirty, not thirteen. Can’t even take care of yourself."

Alexander frowned, running a hand through his hair in irritation.

The last thing he remembered was the splitting headache. He’d gone to the study for medicine. After that—nothing.

"Margaret, did you change my clothes?"

"Who else would?"

He exhaled sharply. "Margaret, I’m thirty. Not a child. You can’t just undress me whenever."

"Oh, please." She rolled her eyes. "I’ve known you since you were in diapers. Do you think I enjoyed it?"

Alexander sighed.

"And whose fault is it that you drove your wife away? Now you’ve got no one to look after you. One day, when I’m gone, you’ll turn into some wild hermit. Then you’ll be happy!"

She continued her lecture, leaving no room for argument.

"Now, take off your shirt."

"Excuse me?" He took a step back.

"The wound on your back needs ointment. It won’t heal if you don’t keep applying it. Hurry up!"

Margaret held up the ointment Mrs. Abernathy had given her, stern.

Alexander’s gaze sharpened. "How did you know about the injury?"

"Because—" She caught herself, remembering Mrs. Abernathy’s warning. "Because I saw it when I changed your clothes last night! That bruise scared me half to death!"

The memory of last night resurfaced—holding Isabella, feeling her warmth, the way she melted against him.

A fierce urge to protect her had surged through him.

Alexander swallowed, desire flickering in his eyes before cooling just as quickly.

Pride was his downfall. He’d apologized, and she’d not only rejected it—she’d slapped him. Humiliated him.

That, he couldn’t forgive.

At 16:45, the butler’s voice interrupted.

"Mr. Kingsley, Mr. Grant is here to see you. He’s waiting in the drawing room."

Alexander’s lips thinned. "Tell him to meet me in the study."

Lucas Grant’s unexpected visit sent Evelyn Prescott’s heart racing. She nearly tripped over herself in excitement.

She changed into her newest haute couture dress, touched up her makeup, spritzed on perfume, and practically floated downstairs.

As she opened her door, she spotted Amelia hugging that ridiculous teddy bear, hopping around the hallway like a child.

Evelyn’s nose wrinkled in disgust. She strode forward in her stilettos and shoved her hard.

"Ah!" Amelia stumbled, crashing to the ground in an ungainly heap. Even then, she clung to the bear.

"I told you not to play in the hallway. Look what happened."

Too pleased to waste time, Evelyn smoothed her hair and swept past.

Had she been in a worse mood, she might’ve stepped on her.

Once Evelyn was gone, Amelia dared to rise.

Years of this had taught her one thing—play the fool, keep her head down, and the yelling lessened.

"Amelia!" Margaret rushed over, helping her up. "What happened? How did you hurt yourself?"

"I’m fine." Amelia pressed her lips together. "Just clumsy."

"I saw Evelyn leaving. Did she push you?" Margaret’s eyes burned with anger.

"No, no! I’m fine! I have to go!"

At the mention of Evelyn, Amelia hugged her bear tighter and scurried off.

Margaret watched her go, teeth clenched.

Lucas had been strolling the gardens. As he re-entered the house, he nearly collided with a beaming Evelyn.

"Mr. Grant!" Her voice dripped honey. "What brings you here? Looking for Alexander?"

"Indeed." His tone was cool. He knew the Abernathy family dynamics better than most.

Evelyn’s mother, Victoria Sterling, was cunning. It colored his view of her.

But Evelyn mistook his reserve for intrigue. She was beautiful, wealthy, bold. Surely he’d fall for her soon.

She tugged her collar lower, pressing against his arm, lips puckered.

"Mr. Grant, let me take you to him."

The next second, his gaze turned glacial.

"Let go. Your perfume is offensive. Don’t ruin my suit."
###Chapter 92

Glynnis's flawless makeup froze instantly, her body tensing like a coiled spring.

"Whoa there, are we suddenly besties? You can't just grab me like that."

Jareth's icy glare could've frozen hell over as he forcefully pulled his arm away.

"Mr. Jareth, I'm sorry! You're Thaddeus's close friend, so I treated you like family. I didn't mean anything inappropriate." Glynnis panicked, desperate to salvage the situation.

"You're his sister, not mine. Keep your hands to yourself next time."

Without another word, Jareth turned on his heel and strode off.

The clothes he wore—gifts from Evadne—were practically sacred to him. He barely washed them, let alone let some random woman sully them with her touch.

Glynnis's nails dug into her palms, her frustration boiling over.

Then—Jareth stopped dead in his tracks.

One hand slid into his pocket as he glanced back at her, his expression unreadable.

Glynnis's heart leapt.

See? He does care!

"Man, I'll never understand women's fashion trends."

"Huh?" She blinked, confused.

"L*pstick, sure. But tooth-stick? That's a new one."

With a mocking smirk, Jareth sauntered away, leaving Glynnis gaping.

It took her a full three seconds before she bolted to the nearest mirror.

Her teeth were smeared with bright red l*pstick.

A shriek of humiliation tore from her throat. She wanted to smash the damn mirror.

In the study, Jareth sprawled across the sofa like he owned the place.

"Glynnis is like some clingy octopus. No sense of personal space. Evadne would never pull that crap."

Thaddeus didn't even look up from Gordon's reports. "What do you want?"

"Just checking if you've recovered from that cold." Jareth lit a cigarette, exhaling a lazy smoke ring. "Feeling smug, aren't you?"

Thaddeus's grip on his pen tightened.

"Eh, I'm alright. At least I can still walk through her front door." Another drag. "Unlike some people."

That stung.

Thaddeus's jaw clenched.

Here he was—Evadne's actual husband—getting drenched like some lovesick fool before being straight-up rejected.

Pathetic.

Jareth crushed his cigarette into the crystal ashtray and leaned across the desk, locking eyes with Thaddeus.

"I'm going to win Evadne over. She'll be mine."

His gaze was razor-sharp, dissecting Thaddeus like a lab specimen.

What the hell does she see in you?

Three years of neglect. A forced divorce. And this guy gets to call himself her husband?

No way.

Thaddeus's breath hitched. "She's with Cassius now."

"As long as she's not with you, I'm good."

A muscle twitched in Thaddeus's jaw.

"Cassius is single. Evadne's divorced. Two consenting adults—what's the issue?" Jareth arched a brow. "But you? Engaged to Acacia, yet lurking outside Evadne's place in the rain? What's next, serenading her at midnight?"

Thaddeus's chest tightened. "Last night wasn't—"

"Save it. You're taken. Back off."

"I won't go there again." Thaddeus's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "But if you actually care about her, don't screw up her chances with the Ashbournes. They adore her. Cassius could give her the life she deserves."

Jareth scoffed. "The Ashbournes aren't the only wealthy family in town. And Evadne isn't marrying Cassius."

"Why not?" Thaddeus's eyes narrowed.

"Because she's not into him. This whole thing? Probably just to piss you off." Jareth smirked. "If I were her, I'd totally flaunt a new guy too. Show my ex I've still got it."

His ears burned as he remembered Evadne's words:

"Without Thaddeus, I won't love anyone. I won't love again."

But hell if he'd admit that to Thaddeus.

The guy's ego was inflated enough already.

Thaddeus's heart lurched.

Was it true?

Would she really throw away her happiness just for revenge?

The hotel was thriving.

Occupancy rates had skyrocketed. The restaurant? Packed daily.

Morale was through the roof—especially after Glynnis's humiliating public apology. The staff finally felt valued.

Evadne lounged in her office, reviewing the financial reports with a satisfied smile.

Success meant one step closer to the presidency.

And she lived for ambition.

"Ms. Evadne, President Ashbourne is here!" Jason announced, ushering Cassius inside.

"Good morning!"

Beaming, Evadne dashed over and hugged him.

"Tired?" Cassius's arm slid around her waist, effortlessly intimate.

"Please. If I can't handle this, how am I supposed to run the company?" She clapped a hand over her mouth, eyes twinkling. "Oops. Not that I'm impatient for you to retire!"

Cassius chuckled, tweaking her nose. "I'm just afraid you'll suddenly vanish to backpack across Europe."

"Never again." Guilt flickered across her face. "I was selfish before. The Ashbournes are my family now—I won't let them down."

Her phone buzzed.

Alva.

Evadne hesitated before answering. "Hello?"

"Mrs. Abernathy—"

"It's just Evadne now."

"Sorry, force of habit." Alva's voice turned urgent. "The medicine you gave Mr. Thaddeus worked! His headaches are gone, and the bruises are fading!"

"That's... good." Evadne's tone was carefully neutral. "I'm busy now—"

"Wait! Do you really not care about him anymore?"

"No."

Alva's voice cracked. "The house is a mess. No one looks after Mari—Glynnis hurts her, and Mr. Thaddeus is never home! I'm just a maid—what can I do?"

Evadne's fists clenched.

Mari.

That sweet, fragile girl—being tormented?

Her vision blurred with rage.
###Chapter 93

Who could believe Glynnis would be so cruel to her own sister, Mari? Had she completely lost her humanity?

"Alva, I understand. But you need to realize I'm no longer Mrs. Abernathy—I'm an outsider now. I can't interfere too much in their family matters." Evadne clenched her fists, torn between fury and helplessness.

"I know, but who else can I turn to? Who else would listen?" Alva's sobs were raw, her voice trembling.

"Alva, don't cry."

Seeing Alva's despair, Evadne's heart ached. She softened her tone. "I'll handle this. Just focus on taking care of Mari. If there's any way I can help, I will."

"Thank you, Mrs. Abernathy!" Alva's gratitude was overwhelming. Even after hanging up, her distress lingered.

Evadne stared at her darkened phone screen, exhaling deeply.

"That was Alva, the servant you've mentioned before?" Cassius set down his coffee cup, watching her carefully.

"Yes. She raised Thaddeus and was always kind to me when I was with the Abernathys." Evadne never forgot those who showed her kindness—or those who wronged her.

"If Alva reached out to you, the situation must be dire."

"It's about Mari." Evadne's chest tightened at the thought of the girl's fragile smile. "She's autistic, introverted. Despite being an Abernathy, her parents ignore her. When I was there, I protected her. Glynnis only held back because of me. Now that I'm gone, she's grown bolder."

"Even if the girl's suffering is tragic, it's still the Abernathys' internal affair." Cassius sighed, concern darkening his gaze. "You're divorced from Thaddeus. It's better to stay out of it."

"I know. I'll restrain myself." Evadne forced a lighter tone. "Weren't you supposed to be at the office? Did you miss me?" She slipped behind him, draping her arms over his shoulders.

"Of course I missed you." Cassius smirked, pulling an envelope from his pocket. "But I came because I received this. Thought we should discuss it."

"What is it?" Evadne frowned.

"An invitation to Mr. Hamilton's birthday. Delivered personally by Frederic Abernathy's secretary." His smile didn't reach his eyes.

"So they've finally dragged you into this." Evadne scoffed, seeing through the ploy instantly. "The Abernathys and Ashbournes have been business rivals for years. Why suddenly invite you to a birthday party?"

"Clearly, this wasn't Frederic's idea. Someone close to him orchestrated it." Cassius stroked his chin thoughtfully. "Evadne, their motives are unclear. This party won't be simple."

"Whatever they're planning, I'm not afraid. If I don't fear Thaddeus, why would I fear Elspeth, a washed-up actress?" Evadne sat beside him, her lips curling coldly. "Everyone has their schemes. The question is whether we play along. If Elspeth wants a game, I'll give her one."

"I could decline the invitation for you. Pretend you never saw it."

"No. I've decided to go." Cassius's voice was firm.

"Why?"

"Evadne, the Ashbournes don't back down from challenges. We face them head-on." His hand rested on her shoulder, his gaze tender. "I didn't know you were suffering before. I couldn't protect you then. Now that you're back with us, I won't let anyone hurt you again."

"Thank you." Tears welled in her eyes.

Cassius pulled her into his arms. "There might be trouble at the party. If you go alone, the Abernathys could corner you. I won't let that happen."

Evadne wiped her eyes, warmth flooding her chest.

Her life had never lacked love.

She'd just been too obsessed with making Thaddeus love her—and it had nearly destroyed her.

Loving someone meant risking heartbreak.

Thaddeus had broken her heart. It was time to move on.

Time flew, and soon, Hamilton's birthday arrived.

The Abernathys spared no expense.

Frederic purchased a historic manor as a gift and hosted the celebration there.

The guest list was a who's who of high society—tycoons, financiers, and Hamilton's old friends, each a luminary in their field.

For the occasion, Acacia and Glynnis had spent a week primping—dress fittings, facials, manicures.

They'd treated it like their own debutante ball, desperate to outshine every woman present.

Unfortunately, the traditional villa made their flashy gowns look garish. They couldn't even find a decent photo backdrop!

"Glynnis, what did you get for Mr. Hamilton?" Acacia asked sweetly.

"An antique vase. He adores history. He'll love it!" Glynnis preened, admiring her new pink diamond ring.

"How old is it?"

"Over three hundred years!"

"Wow, isn't that... a bit morbid for a birthday gift?" Acacia blinked innocently. "I heard Thaddeus bought a five-hundred-year-old relic for four million at auction. He's giving it to Mr. Hamilton. Doesn't that make yours seem... cheap?"

Glynnis flushed. "Thaddeus is the CEO. His gift represents the company. Of course it's grander."

"True, Thad is amazing!" Acacia sighed dreamily.

"Besides, I'm Mr. Hamilton's favorite granddaughter. He'll cherish anything from me." Glynnis snapped. "Enough about me. What did you get?"

"A rare treasure. Cost over a million at auction. You'll see." Acacia grinned, savoring her secrecy.

A million? Hadn't Elspeth said Acacia's family was bankrupt?

Marrying Thaddeus really changed fortunes. Acacia wasn't even officially part of the family yet, and she was already spending Abernathy money like water.

Glynnis's jealousy simmered. "I'm worried for you. Evadne will be here soon. Mr. Hamilton adored her. Won't it be awkward when you see her?"

"Why should I feel awkward? I'm Thaddeus's fiancée! She's the one who should be ashamed!" Acacia's eyes flashed.

"But Evadne isn't officially divorced yet. Today, she still outranks you." Glynnis smirked at Acacia's panic. "What if Mr. Hamilton introduces her as Mrs. Abernathy? What will you do then?"

Acacia paled, fury twisting her features.

"Relax, Acacia."

Glynnis jumped as Elspeth appeared, wineglass in hand.

Acacia clung to her arm like a lifeline.

Glynnis gritted her teeth. Since when were they so close?

Elspeth wasn't Acacia's mother! The audacity!

Elspeth patted Acacia's hand, her gaze icy. "Don't worry, darling. I'm here. If Evadne causes trouble, she'll regret it."
###Chapter 94

"You're an absolute angel!" Isabella Sinclair was so overwhelmed with gratitude that her eyes shimmered with unshed tears.

The atmosphere in the room shifted instantly as the social elite turned their attention toward the entrance.

Nathaniel Kingsley and Lucas Grant, two of the most eligible bachelors in the city, strode in together, commanding every gaze in the room.

Their arrival was magnetic, pulling every eye toward them like a gravitational force.

Both heirs to the prestigious Kingsley and Grant empires, either of them could make hearts race with just a glance.

Nathaniel was dressed in a sharp black suit, exuding power and dominance, while Lucas looked effortlessly elegant in a crisp white ensemble.

"Good heavens. Mr. Kingsley and Mr. Grant are devastatingly handsome!"

"I can't believe I'm seeing them both in the same room! This night just became unforgettable!"

"Did you see Nathaniel Kingsley's jawline? It's like it was carved by the gods themselves!"

"And Lucas Grant—that smirk could melt glaciers. I swear, I'd follow him anywhere."

Vanessa Wright was practically swooning over Lucas.

Isabella nudged her playfully. "Look at how popular Mr. Grant is. When are you finally going to make your move? You've been pining for him for years."

"Patience is a virtue," Vanessa huffed. "All good things come to those who wait. He'll be mine eventually."

"You'd better act fast. Those women are eyeing him like he's the last piece of chocolate cake. You know what they say—the quiet ones are the most dangerous."

Vanessa clenched her teeth, irritation flashing in her eyes.

Her dream was to become Lucas Grant's wife, to stand as the queen of the Grant empire.

But every time she remembered the humiliation he'd once dealt her, she wanted to vanish into thin air.

Still, she refused to give up. She couldn't—not when Isabella would never let her hear the end of it.

Just as Nathaniel and Lucas approached them, the crowd's attention shifted again.

Under the dazzling chandeliers, a breathtaking figure stepped into the room, stealing every gaze.

It was none other than Isabella's worst nightmare—Seraphina Lockwood.

"Seraphina is... stunning," Lucas murmured, unable to look away.

Nathaniel's expression darkened, his pulse quickening.

"Who is that? She's absolutely mesmerizing!"

"Is she wearing a custom-made traditional gown with floral embroidery? It's rare to see someone pull that off so flawlessly!"

"It's not just the dress—it's her. She carries it like royalty. She could be the face of any luxury brand!"

Whispers of admiration filled the air.

Tonight, Seraphina had forgone the typical evening gown in favor of a handcrafted traditional dress, its intricate embroidery catching the light with every graceful movement.

Her choice made her stand out effortlessly, as if she were the true hostess of the evening—outshining Isabella and Vanessa without even trying.

"Damn it! Why didn't I think of wearing a traditional dress?" Vanessa seethed, jealousy burning in her chest.

Even Eleanor Sinclair, who had also chosen an exquisite traditional gown, looked tense.

She had believed only such a dress could showcase her elegance—but now, she realized she couldn't compete with Seraphina's youth and radiance.

And then Isabella noticed something that made her blood run cold.

From the moment Seraphina entered, Nathaniel hadn't taken his eyes off her.

A wave of insecurity and fury crashed over her, dark thoughts swirling in her mind.

"Seraphina!" Lucas called out with a warm smile, waving her over.

She returned the gesture with a polite nod, her lips curving slightly.

Seeing Lucas so openly friendly with Seraphina made Vanessa's blood boil.

As Seraphina moved past Nathaniel, he suddenly reached out, catching her wrist.

"Where do you think you're going?"

"Do I need your permission, Mr. Kingsley?" She arched a brow, slowly pulling her arm free with a teasing smirk.

Before Nathaniel could respond, Eleanor approached with Isabella in tow.

"Seraphina, I'm so glad you could make it. I was worried you wouldn't show."

The guests watched intently, curiosity burning—what was the connection between this beauty and the Kingsleys?

"You overestimate my absence, Eleanor. Mr. Hamilton was looking forward to celebrating with both Nathaniel and me," Seraphina replied smoothly, her tone cool and composed.

Nathaniel's gaze sharpened.

The crowd's murmurs grew louder, their eyes flicking toward Isabella with new scrutiny.

"Didn't they announce her engagement to Nathaniel Kingsley? Even if he hasn't confirmed it, everyone knows she's his fiancée. This woman makes her sound like an afterthought."

"Exactly. And look at her poise—she’s clearly high society. Who is she?"

"She’s even more striking than Isabella. She and Nathaniel look like they belong together."

Isabella's face paled. Was Seraphina deliberately sabotaging her?

Was she broadcasting to the entire room that she was the one with ties to Nathaniel and Mr. Hamilton?

Then what did her position as the Kingsley Group's future lady even mean?

"Seraphina, we all know you're close with Mr. Hamilton," Eleanor said sweetly, though her eyes glinted with malice. "But where’s your other companion? The president of the K Group—Cassius? Mr. Hamilton personally sent him an invitation."

Gasps rippled through the room.

The president of the K Group? Cassius Vanderbilt?

Weren’t the Kingsleys and Vanderbilts sworn enemies? How could he possibly be invited?

Nathaniel knew exactly what Eleanor was doing—trying to corner Seraphina. His expression darkened dangerously.

Before he could intervene, Seraphina arched a brow. "That’s an odd question. Why would I come here with President Vanderbilt?"

"Because he’s your boyfriend, obviously," Eleanor purred, her smirk widening as she dropped the bombshell. "Allow me to introduce everyone. This is Seraphina Lockwood—Nathaniel’s ex-wife. And now, she’s the beloved girlfriend of Cassius Vanderbilt, CEO of the K Group."
###Chapter 95

The grand hall plunged into stunned silence before erupting into shocked whispers within seconds.

Guests who'd come expecting a simple birthday celebration found themselves witnessing an earth-shattering revelation.

Isabella's gaze turned glacial, though her expression remained perfectly composed.

Every move had been meticulously planned.

Beside her, Nathaniel hovered protectively, his muscular frame radiating warmth that seemed to shield her.

"Nathaniel," he murmured anxiously.

"I'm fine." Isabella turned to him with a crescent-moon smile that stole his breath.

Nathaniel's pulse quickened. How could anyone resist such radiant charm?

"Victoria," Alexander interjected coldly, "This is Mr. Kingsley's birthday celebration. Let's not discuss irrelevant matters. Especially not my personal affairs." His displeasure was palpable.

"Forgive my bluntness," Victoria simpered, feigning embarrassment. "I merely wished to introduce Isabella properly. Even divorced from you and the Abernathy name, she was once your wife. We shouldn't let her rural background invite disrespect."

What masterful hypocrisy! As if she truly cared for Isabella's reputation!

The crowd buzzed with speculation, eyeing Isabella with newfound curiosity.

Seraphina and Genevieve exchanged triumphant glances.

This ensured everyone knew Isabella's severed ties with the Abernathys - and her nonexistent connection to Alexander.

No chance remained for Isabella to worm her way back!

"How thoughtful of you." Isabella's lips curved like a crimson rose in full bloom. "But surely my worth isn't tied to marriage? Does coming from the countryside make me inferior? What archaic thinking."

Alexander's jaw tightened. Had their marriage meant nothing to her?

Several guests nodded in agreement.

"Ridiculous! My grandfather was a farmer - now we own half of Napa Valley!"

"Victoria's the one being condescending!"

"Pot calling the kettle black - wasn't she a D-list actress before marrying up?"

Victoria's face flushed scarlet.

Once again, Isabella had turned the tables effortlessly.

"Bravo!" Nathaniel whispered gleefully. "Nothing wrong with country girls - I prefer genuine people."

Isabella rolled her eyes.

Alexander's gaze darkened as he watched their intimate exchange.

"Alexander!" Seraphina materialized at his side, looping her arm through his with practiced ease. "Victoria means well. Clarifying things prevents awkwardness, doesn't it?"

Alexander stiffened at her touch.

Murmurs rippled through the crowd.

"Ms. Sinclair's presence is rather inappropriate, no?"

"Mr. Kingsley invited her personally - that speaks volumes."

"More likely she can't accept losing such an exceptional husband!"

"Isabella, ignore these fools!" Nathaniel growled. "They know nothing about you."

"I never concern myself with petty gossip," Isabella replied serenely.

Just as Seraphina thought she'd salvaged the situation, a thunderous voice cut through the murmurs.

"Who dares trouble my Isabella?!"

All eyes turned as Reginald Kingsley emerged, resplendent in traditional white robes, supported by Frederick and Mr. Montgomery.

Notably absent was his wheelchair - his silver hair impeccably groomed, complexion rosy, posture erect as if years had fallen away.

"Mr. Kingsley." Isabella's face lit with genuine relief.

Victoria shot Seraphina a meaningful glance before simpering, "What a rare family gathering! Seraphina, assist Mr. Kingsley!"

"Allow me, Mr. Kingsley." Seraphina stepped forward with saccharine sweetness.

Reginald chuckled, ignoring her completely. "Alexander, Isabella! You two help me!" He waved Frederick away. "Too slow! Youthful energy does me good!"

Frederick yielded with a wry smile.

Seraphina froze mid-step, humiliation staining her cheeks crimson.

The silent rebuke wasn't lost on anyone.

Isabella's eyes widened, instinctively seeking Alexander's gaze.

Their eyes locked - until she deliberately looked away, presenting him with an icy profile.

Baffled, Alexander approached Reginald with Isabella.

The unspoken message reverberated through the room: Reginald's favor rested firmly with Isabella.

Victoria trembled with suppressed rage. This public slight wasn't just to Seraphina - it was a slap to her face!

Yet she forced a smile. Reginald still held considerable sway in Kingsley Enterprises.

"You look splendid, Mr. Kingsley," Isabella said warmly, supporting his arm.

"Seeing you happy is the best medicine." Reginald beamed. "That qipao suits you perfectly! Far classier than those modern rags!"

Alexander started. So the exquisite dress was Reginald's gift!

The implications weren't lost on the guests.

Clearly, Reginald's affections lay with Isabella, not his supposed future granddaughter-in-law.

Seraphina burned under the collective gaze.

"Shall we take a family portrait?" Victoria interjected, dragging a rigid Seraphina forward. "Isabella, would you mind photographing us?"

"Of course not." Isabella's smile never wavered.

"Isabella is family!" Reginald snapped. "Since when do we relegate family to photographer duties? Stand beside me!" His glare promised consequences. "Upset her, and you answer to me!"

Victoria bit her lip, silently pleading with Frederick.

"Father," Frederick interceded quietly, "however fond you are of Ms. Sinclair, she's divorced from Alexander. A family portrait might be... inappropriate."

"Divorce changes nothing!" Reginald boomed. "She'll always be family to me!"

Isabella's eyes glistened. This was why she couldn't sever ties - her affection for Reginald ran deep.

Seraphina looked ready to combust.

The guests gaped. What magic had this woman worked on the Kingsley patriarch?

"Father," Alexander said tightly, "don't put Isabella in an awkward position. Your intentions are kind, but she may not wish—"

"Nonsense!" Reginald scoffed. "It's you who objects! The moment I mention adoption, you scowl like a petulant child!"

Isabella blinked in surprise.

Alexander looked thunderstruck.

In Reginald's eyes, Isabella's arrival had reduced Alexander to foundling status.

Just as tension peaked, a rich baritone cut through the hall.

"Your care honors her, Mr. Kingsley. But given the divorce, maintaining familial ties seems... imprudent."
###Chapter 96

All heads turned toward the sudden interruption.

Cassian Ashbourne made his entrance, following closely behind Jason with an amused smirk, his confident stride cutting through the crowded lobby.

Isabella's eyes lit up instantly, her heart swelling with pure delight.

Meanwhile, Nathaniel's expression darkened, his piercing gaze turning glacial.

An unexpected chill swept through the air around Isabella, as if an arctic wind had suddenly materialized beside her.

Her gaze flickered nervously to Nathaniel. His handsome features had clouded over, those deep-set eyes now harboring a brewing tempest. The intensity was unsettling.

"Mr. Sinclair, my apologies for the delay."

Cassian offered a courteous bow to the elder Sinclair. The Ashbourne president had forgone his usual tailored suits today, opting instead for an exquisitely crafted traditional ensemble that accentuated his refined elegance.

The surrounding guests found themselves captivated once more.

Between Mr. Kingsley, Mr. Vanderbilt, and President Ashbourne... the attendees were already fantasizing about which billionaire would star in their dreams tonight.

"Not at all, Mr. Ashbourne. Your presence alone honors this celebration," Sinclair replied warmly, showing no trace of discomfort despite Cassian being Emeric Ashbourne's heir.

Isabella exhaled quietly in relief.

She'd feared Mr. Sinclair might disapprove of Cassian's attendance, but her worries had been unfounded.

"Come here, darling," Cassian extended his hand with a tender smile.

Across the room, Victoria and Amelia exchanged knowing glances, their lips curling in malicious anticipation.

They couldn't wait to see Isabella trapped between two powerful men, her carefully constructed facade crumbling before Mr. Sinclair's eyes.

"Of course."

To everyone's shock, Isabella moved without hesitation, her steps light and eager as she crossed to Cassian's side.

Victoria and Amelia's smirks faltered.

Daniel watched the woman he loved return to Cassian's side, the bitter taste of rejection sharp on his tongue. So this was what being second choice felt like. It burned.

Nathaniel's shoulders tensed visibly. His hand twitched upward, grasping at empty air.

He didn't know what he hoped to catch. Only that an indescribable ache had taken root in his chest.

"Hmm? When did Isabella grow so close with Mr. Ashbourne?" Sinclair mused aloud.

"Didn't you know? Isabella is now—"

Victoria's attempted revelation was cut short by Cassian's smooth interjection.

"Mr. Sinclair, I must thank you for your care these past three years. Isabella speaks of you often—considers you family. Your kindness toward her hasn't gone unnoticed."

With that, Cassian's arm slid possessively around Isabella's slender waist.

The crowd gasped.

They made a striking pair—like protagonists stepping out of a prime-time drama.

Nathaniel's fists clenched until his knuckles whitened. His blood ran cold.

"But from today onward," Cassian continued with disarming charm, "Isabella will be under the Ashbourne family's protection. While she may no longer be a Kingsley, her affection for you remains unchanged. You'll always hold the highest place in her heart."

Every word was delivered with impeccable grace and respect.

"Wait—are you two...?" Sinclair's shocked gaze darted between them.

"Isabella and Mr. Ashbourne are together now," Harrison murmured. "She's moved on, so perhaps we should stop pushing her toward Nathaniel. Forced reunions never last."

"Exactly," Victoria chimed in sweetly. "Cassian whisked Isabella away almost immediately after the divorce. Clearly there was something between them all along."

"Something between them?" Sinclair's bushy eyebrows shot upward.

"How else would things progress so quickly?" Victoria's voice dripped honeyed venom. "There's no point clinging to dead marriages. Better to let everyone find true happiness. You needn't worry about Isabella anymore—the Ashbournes are every bit as prestigious as the Kingsleys."

Her words were calculated daggers.

She waited eagerly for Isabella's carefully cultivated innocence to shatter before Mr. Sinclair's eyes.

Isabella worried her lower lip, gaze downcast.

She'd anticipated this moment. Even if Mr. Sinclair condemned her now, she was prepared.

"Mr. Sinclair, don't blame Isabella," Nathaniel interjected hoarsely, his eyes never leaving her. "She owes me nothing. If she's chosen Cassian... I wish her happiness."

The word 'wish' tasted like ash in his mouth.

Isabella's breath hitched. She couldn't help staring at Nathaniel in shock. In all their years together, that proud man had never once called her by that affectionate nickname.

Had he used it during their marriage, she would have treasured it.

Now, her lips twisted in a bitter half-smile. The endearment brought no comfort.

"Ridiculous! As if your blessing matters!" Sinclair snapped, delivering two sharp smacks to Nathaniel's shoulder. "Is it Isabella's fault she found someone better? This is on you! You couldn't recognize a treasure when you had one!"

The blunt declaration sent shockwaves through the room.

Victoria and Amelia paled beneath their makeup.

In that moment, they realized the truth—Mr. Sinclair's favoritism toward Isabella was absolute. No amount of scheming could shake it.

Nathaniel absorbed the scolding silently before gritting out, "As long as you're not angry with her, that's all that matters."

"Angry? I don't have enough hours in the day to adore that girl! Isabella, come here. You too, Mr. Ashbourne!"

Isabella and Cassian shared a brief glance before approaching.

"Mr. Sinclair, I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner—" Isabella began, voice trembling.

"Pish posh! All I care about is your happiness," Sinclair declared warmly before fixing Cassian with a stern look. "Young man, your family's complicated. Promise me you'll protect Isabella—ensure she never faces mistreatment among the Ashbournes. Or I'll personally intervene, regardless of who you are."

Cassian's lips quirked as he recalled Isabella riding his cousin like a pony and doodling on his uncle's face. His response came effortlessly: "You have my word."

Though advanced in years, Sinclair's perception remained razor-sharp. He noted the genuine affection in Cassian's gaze.

With reluctant acceptance, Sinclair sighed. "Mr. Ashbourne, I'm entrusting Isabella to you. Do what Nathaniel failed to—love her properly."

Nathaniel flinched as if struck.

"I will."

Cassian's quiet vow carried unshakable conviction.

Nathaniel's breath came ragged, his gaze locked on Isabella standing beside Cassian.

The woman who was once his.

A profound emptiness engulfed him—as if his very soul had been torn away. Hot tears pricked at his eyes.
###Chapter 97

Shame burned through Thaddeus like wildfire. Jareth observed everything, his chest tightening with each passing second.

The adversary was formidable. What could he possibly do? He needed a solution, and fast!

"Mr. Kingsley, your kindness means the world to me," Evadne murmured gratefully.

"Enough of that—today's your birthday! Let's focus on happier things," Frederic interjected with a bright smile. "Why don't we see what gifts the youngsters have prepared? After that, we can kick off the celebration. No sense keeping our guests waiting."

"Absolutely! Let's open the presents!" Hamiltion clapped his hands like an excited child.

What an endearing old soul!

First, Jareth and other close acquaintances of the Abernathy family stepped forward with their offerings. Hamiltion accepted each one with a gracious nod.

Jareth approached Hamiltion, executing a flawless bow. "Thad and I are practically brothers, which makes you my grandfather too! Wishing you the happiest of birthdays, with many more joyful years ahead!"

"Such a fine young man! Thank you!" Hamiltion beamed.

"Happy birthday, Mr. Kingsley!" Glynnis stepped up, cheeks tinged pink, positioning herself deliberately close to Jareth. "I heard you adore antiques, so I chose this especially for you."

She leaned in slightly, but Jareth sidestepped without sparing her a glance.

Glynnis wobbled, nearly losing her balance before steadying herself.

Muffled laughter rippled through the crowd.

Humiliation burned through her. She silently cursed every snickering guest.

A servant then presented the antique vase Glynnis had procured.

Hamiltion gave an approving nod. "Lovely. Thank you."

Glynnis' lips curled smugly—until Mr. Murray approached, holding a rolled parchment tied with silk. "Mr. Kingsley, this is from Mari."

"Mari's gift? Let me see!" Hamiltion unfurled the paper, his initial surprise melting into delighted laughter. "Is this me? Did Mari sketch this? Remarkable talent! She's truly gifted!"

The guests crowded around, leaving Glynnis forgotten.

The drawing depicted Hamiltion in flowing robes, head thrown back in mirth, every wrinkle rendered with care. Beneath it read: Happy Birthday, Mr. Kingsley. May your days be filled with laughter. —Mari.

"Doesn't it capture me perfectly? Mari has an artist's eye!" Hamiltion boasted.

"Jareth, don't you agree? There's real artistry here," someone remarked.

Jareth's gaze softened at the thought of sweet Mari.

Glynnis' face hardened as if struck.

"While her technique is still developing, Mari undoubtedly has the makings of a great artist," Thaddeus noted.

"Mr. Kingsley, Mari dreams of attending art school," Evadne seized the moment. "Even Thaddeus recognizes her potential. With proper training, the Abernathys could have a celebrated artist in their midst within five years."

Thaddeus frowned, sensing manipulation.

"Do you and Elspeth pay no attention to Mari? Such talent deserves nurturing!" Hamiltion chided.

"Of course, you're right..." Frederic and Elspeth conceded through gritted teeth.

"I adore Mari's gift. Where is she?" Hamiltion asked warmly.

"She's resting upstairs but will join us later," Mr. Murray replied.

"Ah..." Hamiltion sighed. "Have this framed for my study. I want to admire it daily."

Glynnis' eyes flashed crimson with envy. She'd assumed Mari's limited funds would yield a pitiful gift—yet here was a handmade treasure, praised above her costly vase.

Just you wait, Mari.

Elsewhere, Acacia paced the hallway, frantic. "Elspeth, it backfired! Thaddeus and Evadne are closer than ever!"

"Patience," Elspeth purred, eyes glinting. "Our special guest arrives soon. I have plenty of ways to humiliate Evadne and tarnish her reputation."

The gift ceremony continued.

When Thaddeus presented the antique violin, the room buzzed with awe.

Hamiltion's collector friends swarmed for a closer look, but he clutched the case protectively. "Hands off! This is Thaddeus' gift to me!"

The crowd erupted in laughter, Evadne covering her smile.

"This piece was donated by Suri of K Group at a charity auction. Rare and exquisite—I'm glad it pleases you," Thaddeus explained.

"It must be from Chairman Emeric's private collection! His taste is unparalleled in Elmsworth!" Hamiltion marveled.

"Chairman Emeric would be honored by your appreciation," Cassius said smoothly, ever the diplomat.

"Mr. Kingsley, my gift for you!" Acacia's saccharine voice cut through.

All eyes turned—many laced with disdain. Hamiltion's indifference to her was no secret.

"Acacia went to great lengths," Frederic announced. "Knowing your love for classical art, she acquired an authentic masterpiece at auction."

"Oh? Authentic?" Hamiltion perked up.

Acacia's gloved attendant unrolled the painting with ceremony.

The collectors leaned in—only for Hamiltion's enthusiasm to dim. "Thank you," he said flatly.

Then, a murmur: "Is this... a forgery?"
###Chapter 98

"You must be joking!" Isabella's smile froze, her voice trembling with rage. "I purchased this painting at the Kingsley Group's auction. How could it possibly be a fake?"

This accusation dragged the Kingsley Group into the scandal.

Alexander scoffed, his tone dripping with disdain. "Ms. Sinclair, it seems you're unfamiliar with how auctions work. Parkray Auction, under the Kingsley Group, is the most prestigious in the country. Every item undergoes rigorous authentication—there's no chance a forgery would slip through. Perhaps your lack of expertise in art is the issue here, but don't tarnish our reputation with baseless claims."

Nathaniel's eyes darkened.

He remembered the charity auction vividly—how Evelyn had subtly encouraged Isabella to bid ten times the painting's value, her lips curling into that enigmatic smile.

Had Evelyn anticipated Isabella gifting this painting to Mr. Vanderbilt?

Was this mere coincidence, or had Evelyn set a trap from the beginning?

"Ms. Sinclair, there's a distinction between a forgery and a replica," an art expert interjected, defending the Kingsley Group. "Some replicas are original works in their own right—many artists recreate famous pieces. That doesn't make them forgeries. A well-executed replica can be incredibly valuable. However... yours falls short. Otherwise, I wouldn't have spotted the flaws immediately."

"A replica? Impossible! I paid a million for this at Parkray Auction!"

Isabella's face drained of color, panic setting in.

A million—wasted on a fake? Had she been played for a fool?

Laughter rippled through the crowd.

Victoria had to bite her lip to keep from bursting into laughter.

What a spectacle.

"A million? This piece isn't worth more than a hundred thousand. Your generous contribution to charity is commendable, though."

Isabella swayed, the room spinning around her.

Sophia turned away, unwilling to defend the humiliated Ms. Sinclair.

"Regardless of its value, it's a gift from Ms. Sinclair," Mr. Vanderbilt said diplomatically, though his disdain was palpable. "Mr. Lockwood, take the painting."

Tears welled in Isabella's eyes as she whirled on Evelyn, her voice shaking with fury. "Evelyn! What grudge do you hold against me? Why would you do this?"

From the moment she'd arrived at the birthday gala, she'd been mocked and belittled. Now, she couldn't take it anymore.

All eyes turned to Evelyn, curious.

Evelyn blinked, her expression the picture of innocence. "Hurt you? Ms. Sinclair, I don't understand. What do you mean?"

Sebastian and Alexander exchanged stunned glances.

Was this the classic case of turning the tables?

"This was your trap! You knew this was a replica, yet you drove the price up to a million! This is all your fault!" Isabella jabbed a finger at Evelyn, her voice hoarse with rage. "I may not be an art expert, but you—you knew! You manipulated me into buying this worthless piece! How could you?!"

Nathaniel's lips thinned, his icy gaze locked onto Evelyn.

"I never persuaded you to do anything," Evelyn said softly, her eyes wide with feigned confusion. "When did I ever force you to bid?"

"Ms. Sinclair, auctions are public events. No one forces anyone to bid—you made your own choices," Sebastian cut in, a smirk playing on his lips.

"You—!" Isabella's chest heaved. "When you saw I wanted the painting, you deliberately outbid me! Every time I raised my offer, you countered! You drove the price from a hundred thousand to nine hundred thousand—then dropped out when I hit a million! You set me up!"

"Again, Ms. Sinclair, this is a replica, not a forgery," Alexander interjected dryly.

"If Evelyn wanted the painting, why didn't she keep bidding? She just wanted to humiliate me!" Isabella seethed.

The murmurs in the room grew louder.

"Is Evelyn still bitter about the divorce? Is this her revenge?"

"Pathetic. They're already divorced—what's the point?"

"The point? Nathaniel is a catch. Of course she's not over him."

"Looks can be deceiving. Even the smartest women resort to petty games when it comes to men."

The whispers fueled Isabella's satisfaction.

"Evelyn, is this true?" Frederic frowned, his tone stern.

Mr. Vanderbilt studied Evelyn, waiting for her response.

"Ms. Sinclair, you've misunderstood me completely." Evelyn stepped forward, her eyes shimmering with hurt. "I placed the first bid. You only joined after seeing me. I adore this painting—I wanted to support the charity and secure it for myself. Mr. Prescott and Mr. Kingsley can confirm this."

The tables had turned.

"Evelyn, you—!" Isabella choked on her fury.

"I can attest to that!" Alexander jumped in, eager to defend Evelyn. "Evelyn bid first. The painting should rightfully be hers."

Nathaniel shot Alexander a glare.

This man was insufferable.

"I intended to keep the replica because I own the original," Evelyn explained, her voice soft. "It reminds me of cherished moments with my family."

She bit her lip, lowering her gaze. "True, Ms. Sinclair also wanted it. We bid back and forth, but ultimately, I chose to step aside. I don't understand why you're accusing me... If you feel wronged, I'll compensate you for the painting."

The shift was masterful. Evelyn's eyes glistened with unshed tears, her performance flawless.

Nathaniel watched her, his chest tightening.

She was putting on a show—and he was the unwilling audience.

"What nonsense!" Isabella's face burned crimson.

Sophia pinched her arm sharply, silencing her before she could escalate the scene.

"A misunderstanding, Mr. Vanderbilt," Sophia said smoothly. "Isabella rarely attends such events. She only wanted to show her respect for you." She shot Isabella a warning look. "Mrs. Sterling just called—something urgent. You should return her call immediately."

Isabella clenched her jaw and stormed off.

After a beat of silence, Mr. Vanderbilt took Evelyn's hand. "If you love the painting, just tell me. I'd give you anything you desire."

"Thank you, Mr. Vanderbilt. Your kindness is more than enough." Evelyn smiled sweetly, squeezing his hand.

The message was clear.

Nathaniel and Evelyn might be divorced—but their story wasn't over.

As for Isabella?

Her hopes had just gone up in flames.
###Chapter 99

Isabella Sinclair finally unveiled her gift for Mr. Dubois.

When the legendary Medici Throne was revealed, every antique collector in the room gasped in awe.

"Good heavens! That's an authentic masterpiece!"

"I'm completely mesmerized! If only I could examine it up close!"

"Among all the presents Mr. Dubois received today, aside from the Stradivarius from Mr. Prescott, this throne is undoubtedly the most priceless!"

"Who exactly is this Ms. Sinclair? Dropping serious cash on rare antiquities like it's nothing? Seems Mr. Prescott's ex-wife wasn't exactly struggling!" Nathan Prescott's pulse quickened as his gaze locked onto Isabella.

He never anticipated she'd gift Mr. Dubois the 10-million-dollar artifact she'd acquired at the Vanderbilt auction.

Clearly, the Vanderbilt Group treated her like royalty.

But her next words nearly made him choke.

"Mr. Dubois, this is a joint gift from President Vanderbilt and myself. Wishing you boundless health and happiness." Isabella's eyes sparkled with genuine warmth as she offered her congratulations.

Alexander Kingsley gave a respectful bow, his voice smooth as velvet. "Mr. Dubois, may your days be filled with joy and your years with prosperity."

Standing side by side, they radiated elegance and sophistication - a picture-perfect couple.

Nathan felt his heart hammer against his ribs. He discreetly pressed a hand to his chest, terrified someone might notice.

"This is far too generous! I'm deeply touched!" Mr. Dubois exclaimed, though added, "Isabella, anything from you would have delighted me. Mr. Kingsley, your kindness overwhelms me."

Alexander chuckled. "We simply wanted to select something worthy of your celebration."

"Mr. Dubois, you must accept it." Victoria Sterling sneered. "Though how convenient - letting someone else foot the bill while taking all the credit. Ms. Sinclair certainly knows how to economize."

Isabella arched a brow. "I wouldn't dream of claiming undue credit, which is why I prepared a personal gift as well. Though it pales beside President Vanderbilt's offering."

Victoria's eyes bulged. This woman had a backup present?

"Really? Isabella, show me at once!" Mr. Dubois' face lit up like a child's on Christmas morning.

A mischievous glint flashed in Isabella's eyes as she clapped her hands.

Moments later, Daniel Carter entered, impeccably dressed, cradling an ornate case.

Inside rested a breathtaking landscape carved from rare gemstones - so lifelike the mountains seemed to breathe!

"Magnificent!" The crowd murmured in awe.

The exquisite craftsmanship captivated both Nathan and Sebastian. The skill required for such precision was staggering!

"My word!" Mr. Dubois' hands trembled as he pointed. "Is this Moreau's Eternal Dawn? Isabella, however did you acquire this?"

Moreau?! The legendary French sculptor whose works were nearly impossible to obtain?

"You flatter me, Mr. Dubois. I could never obtain Master Moreau's Eternal Dawn." Isabella ducked her head shyly, cheeks pinkening. "This is my humble imitation: Fleeting Dawn. I devoted weeks to it, though it falls far short of the original."

The room erupted in astonished whispers.

Practice?! That was master-level artistry!

Only the most skilled hands could etch such intricate scenes into solid stone. From a distance, one might mistake it for Moreau's genuine work!

Who was this remarkable woman? Could she be Moreau's protégé?

Admiring gazes followed Isabella everywhere.

Only Cassandra and Victoria looked like they'd swallowed lemons.

Since leaving the Prescott family, this woman had transformed completely. She kept outmaneuvering them at every turn!

"Isabella, my dear, you're absolutely extraordinary!" Mr. Dubois clasped her hands, beaming.

"To have such a wife would be any man's dream," Sebastian murmured, watching her intently.

Nathan shot him an icy glare, his expression frostier than a winter storm.

Seeing Isabella basking in everyone's admiration, he realized how vast the gulf between their worlds had become - yet he'd once been her husband!

Shock, fury, resentment - emotions tangled like thorned vines around Nathan's heart.

He'd been deceived again by this infuriating woman!

The celebration continued amidst laughter and lively conversation.

Excusing herself to freshen up, Isabella left Mr. Dubois' side.

En route, she reflected on Cassandra and Victoria's pathetic attempts to embarrass her. Amusing, really.

For all their experience, they still underestimated her.

She'd anticipated their every move, but they'd forgotten one crucial factor: Mr. Dubois' genuine affection for her.

Love was an impenetrable fortress no scheme could breach.

Isabella knew Alexander couldn't present the Medici Throne alone, so she'd spent weeks carving her personal gift.

Her exceptional skill stemmed from childhood years observing Master Laurent transform raw stone into art.

In that sense, Moreau was her artistic grandfather.

The winding corridor confused first-time visitors. Isabella soon found herself disoriented.

Just then, a plump tabby sauntered past.

"Hello there, little one," she cooed, her mood lifting instantly. Laughing, she gave chase.

Her traditional gown restricted movement, and her heels slipped on the polished marble. She lurched forward dangerously.

Straight toward a staircase!

"Ah!"

Eyes squeezed shut, she braced for impact.

Suddenly, strong arms encircled her from behind.

The secure embrace instantly calmed her racing heart.

Then she felt herself being gently lifted against a familiar, solid chest.

"Meow!"

Perched on a decorative urn, the cat regarded her before vanishing.

Isabella slowly opened her eyes but didn't turn around, steadying her breathing.

Nathan could feel every curve of her back pressed against him.

His pulse accelerated dangerously.

"Release me. Planning to hold me indefinitely?" Isabella bit her lip, struggling.

Nathan's gaze darkened. His hand lingered at her waist before reluctantly letting go.

"Don't flatter yourself. I merely prevented your fall," he said icily.

"Don't expect gratitude." Isabella steadied herself against a pillar, turning to glare. "I'd rather break bones than endure your touch."

The setting sun gilded her striking features.

"I took advantage?" Nathan's lips curled into a smirk. "If I wanted that, would I have waited until now?"

"Nathan!" Her eyes flashed dangerously.

"Weren't you the one begging for my attention before?" His gaze turned arctic. "The divorce hasn't erased our history."

From the moment she'd arrived, she'd been shaking his world. If this continued, he'd need medical attention.

Isabella's mood plummeted. Humiliation burned through her.

"So what now? Regretting what you threw away?"

"Isabella—"

"Mr. Prescott, that ship has sailed. What I once offered freely, you rejected. Now? Too late!"

Nathan's eyes burned crimson. He seized her wrist, slamming her against the pillar!
###Chapter 100

"Damn it!" Isabella slammed against the marble pillar, a sharp gasp escaping her lips. "Nathaniel! Have you lost your damn mind?"

Nathaniel's grip on her wrist was ironclad, his knuckles white with barely contained rage.

Their heated breaths mingled in the charged space between them.

"Lies upon lies, Evelyn. Did you really think I wouldn't find out?" Nathaniel's voice was dangerously low, each word dripping with venom.

"What exactly did I lie about?" Evelyn's eyes flashed with defiance, tears pooling at their edges. "You never bothered to know me. Three years, Nathaniel. Three damn years I waited for you to ask anything about me!"

Nathaniel's jaw clenched, his pulse hammering against his skin.

"Do you know my favorite color? My childhood fears? The song that makes me dance when no one's watching?" Evelyn's voice cracked. "I memorized every detail about you while you couldn't even remember my birthday!"

The air between them crackled with unspoken accusations.

"You treated me like some forgotten trophy on your shelf," Evelyn continued, her voice raw. "Collecting dust while waiting for you to glance my way just once."

Nathaniel flinched as if struck, the color draining from his face.

Yes, he'd abandoned her first.

The memory of her tear-streaked face when he'd forced those divorce papers on her haunted him still.

She'd fought so hard to stay then. What changed?

"Your indifference was the wake-up call I needed," Evelyn said, her smile sharp enough to draw blood. "Now the only thing I want from you is distance."

Nathaniel felt the words like physical blows.

"Evelyn, look me in the eyes and tell me you don't still feel something."

"Save your breath."

"That thing with Dominic - it's just revenge, isn't it?"

"Dominic?" Evelyn laughed, the sound hollow. "At least he sees me. Something you never managed in three years."

Nathaniel moved closer, their noses almost touching. "You're lying."

Evelyn turned her face away. "Get therapy, Nathaniel. Preferably far from me."

But Nathaniel caught her chin, forcing her gaze to meet his. "You hate me so much you'd fake a relationship just to twist the knife?"

"Hate you?" Evelyn's lips curled. "With Dominic, I'm finally breathing. With you? I was suffocating."

"You're unbelievable." Nathaniel's voice shook. "Marrying you was my greatest regret."

Evelyn went rigid, the words carving through her.

Thirteen years of love reduced to a single sentence.

How pathetic could one woman be?

Seeing her tears, Nathaniel immediately released her, regret flashing across his features.

The words had escaped before he could stop them.

"Mr. Kingsley? Ms. Sinclair?"

Mr. Bennett's sudden appearance shattered the moment.

Evelyn stepped back smoothly. "Mr. Bennett, I thought you were with Mr. Montgomery in the main hall?"

Mr. Bennett glanced between them nervously. "There's an issue with the performance. The headliner fell ill - vomiting, fever, the works. The stage is set, the guests are waiting..."

Evelyn's expression shifted instantly. "Leave it to me."

Nathaniel watched, stunned, as she transformed before his eyes.

Even now, she'd step up for his family.

"Where's backstage?" Evelyn was already moving.

As she disappeared with Mr. Bennett, Nathaniel's hand clenched at his side.

The garden buzzed with anticipation.

Mr. Montgomery sat surrounded by guests - Dominic, Adrian, even Genevieve. Only Arabella sat apart, her exclusion deliberate.

Her phone vibrated with a message from Victoria: [Opportunities don't knock twice.]

Arabella's grip tightened. She wouldn't be humiliated again.

"Where are Nathaniel and Evelyn?" Mr. Montgomery frowned.

Nathaniel took his seat beside Adrian, his expression stormy.

"Evelyn's probably lost," Dominic stood. "I'll—"

"No need," Nathaniel cut in coldly. "I know where she is."

Adrian nearly spilled his drink. The tension was palpable.

Then the curtains parted.

Gasps rippled through the crowd as a vision in sapphire silk took center stage, pearls glinting under the lights.

Nathaniel shot to his feet.

"That's..." Mr. Bennett whispered to Mr. Montgomery, pointing.

Every eye locked onto the radiant figure commanding the stage.

Nathaniel's heart pounded violently against his ribs.
###Chapter 101

Her eyes shimmered like autumn lakes, deep and mesmerizing.

With a single graceful turn, her silhouette seemed to pierce straight through Thaddeus's chest.

Her voice was hauntingly beautiful, weaving a spell over the entire audience.

Thaddeus couldn't look away.

One on stage, one in the crowd—separated by time, by fate, yet drawn together as if destiny had orchestrated this moment.

Every flicker of her smile, every subtle movement, made his heart ache with something he couldn't name.

"Is that really her?!" Hamiltion's grip tightened on the armrest, his voice trembling with excitement. "It has to be! Look at her—that delicate nose, those lips—it's her!"

Thaddeus suddenly slumped back in his seat, his vision blurring. A sharp pain lanced through his temples.

"Thad? What's wrong?" Jareth leaned in, concern etching his features.

"I'm fine." Thaddeus pressed a hand to his forehead, his gaze darkening.

Why did that name—her name—sound so familiar?

And why did it feel like a knife twisting in his chest?

Hamiltion was lost in the music, his expression soft with nostalgia.

Evadne had always visited him, singing to lift his spirits.

She remembered the first time he'd heard her voice—how tears had spilled down his weathered cheeks as memories of his beloved Fiona flooded back.

Fiona had been a legendary singer, and Hamiltion had loved her fiercely, defying his family to make her his wife. Their love story had been the stuff of fairy tales.

Evadne had once envied that kind of love.

Until Thaddeus shattered her heart.

The audience was spellbound, completely absorbed in her performance.

"I heard she's Thaddeus's ex-wife! How could he let someone like her go?"

"Shh! She's with President Ashbourne now!"

"Did you see the way Thaddeus was looking at her? He's still in love with her."

"Obviously. She's everything he ever wanted—unlike that tacky Acacia."

Acacia's face burned with humiliation. She stormed away, fists clenched.

She found a secluded corner, her mind racing with venomous thoughts.

Elspeth had been pushing her to act—but she wasn't stupid enough to be someone else's pawn.

No. She needed an ally.

And Glynnis, with her simmering hatred, was perfect.

A quick message later, Glynnis arrived, her heels clicking furiously against the marble.

"That witch! How dare she steal the spotlight again!"

Acacia smirked. "Oh, please. Singing? How common. Performers are just glorified entertainers—nothing more."

Glynnis's lips curled. "You're right. She's beneath us."

"Tell me, Glynnis... don't you want revenge?"

Glynnis's eyes gleamed. "More than anything."

Acacia leaned in, her voice a whisper. "Then let's ruin her."

She pulled out two vials—clear, unassuming, deadly.

Glynnis recoiled. "What is that?"

"A little... push." Acacia's smile was icy. "One dose for Cassius. One for her."

Glynnis paled. "You want to—here?!"

"Imagine the scandal." Acacia's voice dripped with malice. "The Ashbourne name destroyed. Thaddeus disgusted. And Jareth? He'd never look at her again."

Glynnis hesitated—but the image of Jareth's adoring gaze on Evadne burned in her mind.

She nodded.

The music swelled, wrapping the room in its embrace.

Jareth watched Evadne, utterly captivated.

Thaddeus's chest ached, his throat tight.

Cassius sighed. "Love like that... it hurts."

The words struck Thaddeus like a blow.

Then—gasps.

A ripple through the crowd.

Evadne faltered, her voice trembling.

Her gaze locked onto the figure striding through the room—tall, commanding, impossible.

Emeric.

Chairman of the K Group.

Here.

Now.

The whispers exploded.

"Is that—Emeric?!"

"The Ashbournes and Abernathys—truce?!"

Evadne's heart pounded.

Why was he here?

Who invited him?

The world tilted.

And the game changed.
###Chapter 102

Cassian's eyes widened in shock as he swiftly greeted the newcomer.

"What brings you here?"

His gaze involuntarily flickered toward Isabella on the stage.

"Well, if you can be here, why can't I?" Emeric replied with a hint of displeasure. "You could've at least given me a heads-up so we could arrive together, father and son."

He then turned with a cheerful laugh and raised his glass to Alexander. "Mr. Kingsley, long time no see! You're looking more vibrant than ever!"

"Emeric! What a pleasant surprise!" Alexander immediately stood and clasped Emeric’s hand warmly.

Frederick, Eloise, and the other young guests followed suit.

Thaddeus stiffened at the unexpected appearance of Chairman Emeric, his brow furrowing.

He had meticulously reviewed the guest list before the party—neither Cassian nor Emeric had been on it. And judging by Alexander’s reaction, he hadn’t known either.

Frederick must have personally invited them.

But if that were the case, something felt off.

"I just landed and rushed straight here. My apologies for the delay!" Emeric said smoothly, his manners impeccable.

Thaddeus exhaled sharply. In this distinguished man, he saw not just Cassian’s shadow but also Isabella’s.

He was losing his mind—just a little.

What kind of spell had Isabella cast?

Emeric chatted warmly with Alexander, showing no trace of their families’ former enmity.

But the tension between Emeric and Frederick was palpable—if one knew where to look.

With such an esteemed guest present, the younger generation naturally yielded their seats. Thaddeus and Jareth rose to move to the back, making space for Emeric at the head table.

"Mr. Kingsley, Jareth and I will excuse ourselves," Thaddeus said with a polite bow.

"It’s been years since I last saw you two," Emeric remarked, glancing at Thaddeus before addressing Alexander. "Mr. Kingsley, I hear Thaddeus is getting married?"

At the mention of the wedding, Alexander’s smile dimmed slightly.

"Chairman Emeric, Thaddeus is engaged to Seraphina from the Sterling Group. The wedding is next month—we’d be honored if you could attend," Frederick interjected smoothly.

"The Sterling Group? Never heard of them," Emeric said flatly.

Frederick and Eloise exchanged uneasy glances.

"Seraphina is my niece. She and Thaddeus grew up together," Eloise added hesitantly.

The recent furniture scandal had already strained relations between the Ashbourne and Sterling groups. Bringing it up now would only make things worse.

But Emeric’s dismissive tone irked her. If Seraphina was slighted, so was she.

"Ah. Well, Mr. Kingsley, let’s toast!"

Emeric had already moved on, indifferent to Thaddeus’s marital prospects—as long as it wasn’t Isabella.

Thaddeus wasn’t worthy of her.

On stage, Isabella had just finished her song when Emeric’s gaze landed on her.

Her heart pounded so violently she feared it might leap from her chest.

Thankfully, the heavy stage makeup and distance masked her identity. After a brief pause, Emeric looked away.

Seizing the moment, Isabella bolted offstage, her dress damp with sweat.

Just then, Cassian’s message lit up her phone:

[Isabella, Dad’s here. Lay low for the rest of the night. I’ll handle things. Stay in touch.]

[Got it.]

Meanwhile, Emeric turned to Alexander. "That young lady who just sang—she was remarkable. Where did you find her?"

Alexander chuckled proudly. "She’s not just anyone—she’s my granddaughter!"

"Excellent! If you claim her as family, she must be extraordinary indeed."

Thaddeus glanced back at the stage—only to find it empty.

Isabella had vanished.

His jaw tightened, emotions churning in his eyes.

Near the tea room, chaos ensued as staff hurried in and out.

A maid bribed by Giselle slipped inside unnoticed.

She avoided the cameras, uncorked two bottles of sedative-laced champagne, and poured them into glasses. "One for Cassian, the other for Jareth. Got it?"

Giselle’s orders were clear—her future depended on this.

Nerves getting the better of her, the maid suddenly dashed to the restroom.

At that moment, a girl in white—Mari—sneaked in unnoticed.

Her bright eyes darted around before she snatched a glass and downed it in one gulp.

Mari had a secret: she loved alcohol. She often raided the wine cellar at night. Tonight was no exception.

"Ahh, delicious!" She licked her lips, poured another, and scurried off like a mischievous squirrel.

Meanwhile, with Emeric’s unexpected arrival, Isabella avoided Alexander entirely.

The banquet table overflowed with delicacies, but Thaddeus had no appetite. He prowled the hall, his expression stormy.

"To you, Cassian." Jareth raised his glass, his gaze complex. "You’re lucky to have someone like Isabella. Treat her right—cherish her, love her. Don’t break her heart."

Cassian met his eyes, lifting his own glass. "I intend to."

Jareth’s chest ached. He pulled out a business card and handed it to Cassian.

"My contact information."

Cassian arched a brow. "I know who you are, Jareth."

"But you might not know this—I have feelings for Isabella too."

Jareth’s honesty hung heavy in the air.

Thaddeus’s grip on his glass turned white-knuckled.

"Is that so?" Cassian remained unruffled.

"Winning her is one thing; keeping her is another. Many would kill for a chance with her. If you ever tire of her, just say the word—I’ll take her off your hands." Jareth’s tone was deadly serious.

"Noted. But that day will never come." Cassian smirked, amused by the absurdity.

Thaddeus couldn’t take it anymore. He stood and stalked out, his face icy.

Every word between them felt like a knife twisting in his gut.

The moment he stepped outside, Seraphina flung herself into his arms. "Thad!"

Then he spotted a familiar figure walking past—Isabella.

His throat tightened.

Seizing his distraction, Seraphina pressed a kiss to the corner of his lips.

Isabella’s bright eyes darkened. She turned and walked away as if she hadn’t seen a thing.

"Ah!"

Thaddeus recoiled, shoving Seraphina back so hard she stumbled.

"Thad! How could you push me?"

He wiped his mouth roughly. "I hate being forced."
###Chapter 103

Isabella had been openly pursuing Alexander, showing her affection without restraint. Yet in his eyes, it was nothing but manipulation? "Alexander, I'm your fiancée! How could you say such things about me?" Isabella's eyes instantly welled up with tears she refused to shed.

"Isabella, you've known since the beginning that I can't handle overly affectionate women." Alexander took a deep breath, his gaze turning frosty.

"Yes, I know. I've always known."

Because of Alexander's traumatic childhood and upbringing, he'd never been able to form genuine intimacy with women. Even expressing emotions was a monumental step for him.

Otherwise, women would have snatched up such an eligible bachelor long ago, even without Evelyn's interference.

"But ever since we reconciled, you seem to have forgotten that."

Alexander clenched his fists, remembering Evelyn's icy stare.

He felt confused and guilty, yet couldn't pinpoint what he'd done wrong.

Never in his life had he felt so lost.

"But Alexander, we're getting married!" Isabella's eyes burned red with agitation. "We're not children anymore. We can't just hold hands forever! I'll share your bed, bear your children!"

Alexander instinctively stepped back.

He thought marrying this woman was what he wanted.

Then why did he feel increasingly panicked and resistant as the wedding approached?

Suddenly, the door burst open again.

Lucas staggered out from the banquet hall, his face flushed, tie loosened, hands trembling. His unfocused eyes suggested intoxication.

Alexander frowned when he felt the unnatural heat radiating from Lucas as he passed by.

Isabella hid behind Alexander, a cold smirk playing on her lips.

Meanwhile, Evelyn had just changed and removed her makeup backstage.

"Ms. Evelyn! Something's wrong!" A maid rushed up anxiously. "Mr. Ashbourne isn't feeling well and is resting in his room. Could you please check on him? He seems... uncomfortable."

Hearing Lucas was unwell, Evelyn's heart immediately raced.

"Take me to him now!"

With Alexander and Lucas both gone, Daniel found himself bored and decided to stroll through the gardens.

Night had fallen, stars blanketing the sky. The tranquil garden featured a charming bridge over a babbling brook.

Daniel admired the garden lights under the hazy moonlight - a truly beautiful sight.

Just then, rustling came from nearby bushes.

Daniel's pupils contracted. He spun around sharply. "Who's there?"

Silence. The noise stopped.

Probably just a stray cat.

As Daniel turned to leave, the rustling resumed!

This time accompanied by a soft feminine whimper.

Someone was definitely there.

Daniel's brows furrowed as he approached the bushes.

The weak voice carried hints of distress.

His pulse quickened, throat tightening as he drew nearer.

"Who's there? Show yourself."

Parting the foliage, he glimpsed white fabric. Pushing further, he froze.

Under dim lighting, the girl's porcelain skin glowed. Her eyes were misty, lips slightly parted as she struggled to breathe.

Daniel's lips trembled in shock.

"Seraphina?! What are you doing here?"

"I'm... so hot."

Seraphina lifted her flushed face, entire body trembling. From her cheeks to her delicate neck, all bore a telltale pink hue.

"Hot? Are you sick? You can't stay hidden here!"

Confused, Daniel reached to pull her out, but her skin burned like a furnace at his touch.

"Do you have a fever?" he asked urgently.

"Mr. Daniel... help me..."

Seraphina's consciousness blurred, Daniel's face swimming before her.

Yet his touch brought inexplicable relief.

She didn't understand why, only that she craved more contact, needed him closer.

"Seraphina—" Daniel's words died as a wave of heat hit him. Suddenly, Seraphina clung to him desperately, sending them tumbling into the bushes. She straddled him, hypersensitive to every touch.

Despite his experience, no woman had ever come onto him like this.

Let alone such a young girl!

What the hell was happening?

"Seraphina! Stop this! I have a girlfr—mmph!"

Her lips crashed onto his, stealing his breath.

Daniel's heart stuttered.

Their heated breaths mingled as the world around them stilled.

Meanwhile, Vanessa paced anxiously, unable to locate Daniel and unsure if he'd consumed the spiked drink.

She hadn't told Isabella about drugging Daniel too.

Having committed, she planned to seduce Daniel, then pressure her parents to arrange their marriage.

Under the Abernathy family's influence, Daniel wouldn't refuse.

But where had he disappeared to?

"Vanessa!" A maid hurried over.

"Is everything set?" Vanessa whispered cautiously.

"All arranged! I personally escorted Mr. Ashbourne in, then brought Evelyn over," the maid giggled proudly. "Mr. Ashbourne was definitely drugged. He and Evelyn must be... occupied by now."

"What about Daniel? Did you see him?"

"No, I didn't."

"Are you certain you drugged him?" Vanessa's face flushed with anxiety.

"Positive! I watched both men drink! If Mr. Ashbourne's affected, Daniel must be too!" the maid assured. As Vanessa fretted, Isabella called. She quickly moved to take the call privately.

"Vanessa, excellent work. Now... let the show begin!"
###Chapter 104

The living room was unnervingly quiet when Isabella stepped inside.

Her fingers trembled as she flicked the light switch. "Nathaniel?" Her voice was rough with worry. "Nathaniel, where are you?"

A faint sound came from the bedroom.

Her pulse spiked. She rushed toward the door, calling out, "Nathaniel! What's wrong? Are you sick?"

"Isabella, don't come in!" His voice was strained, his breathing ragged.

"Nathaniel! What the hell is going on? You're scaring me!"

Her face drained of color. She was about to push the door open when it suddenly flew back with a violent crash.

Nathaniel stood there, drenched, as if he'd been submerged in water. His skin was flushed, his shirt clinging to his body, the fabric nearly transparent. The top buttons were undone, revealing his scorching red chest.

"Nathaniel?"

"I've been drugged." His vision blurred as he fought to focus on her. "I tried cold showers, ice—nothing's working. This isn't just some weak sedative."

"What the hell happened?!" Fury and panic warred inside her.

She was a surgeon, capable of performing intricate brain operations, but faced with her brother in this state, she felt utterly helpless. "Isabella, it's a setup. Lock the door and leave. I can fight this." His breathing grew heavier, his pupils dilated.

His gaze dropped to her bare arm.

A wave of terror crashed over him at the hunger that surged through his veins.

If she stayed, he wouldn't be able to control himself.

"Nathaniel! I'm not leaving you like this! We're going to the hospital—now!"

She'd never seen him in such agony. Tears burned in her eyes.

Just as she moved toward him, a loud shatter split the air.

Nathaniel had smashed a vase against the wall.

He grabbed a jagged shard and clenched it in his fist. Blood dripped between his fingers, but he held on, using the pain to anchor himself.

"Nathaniel!" Her heart shattered.

He was hurting himself to protect her.

"Isabella, please—go!" His voice was raw with desperation. "Get out!"

The banquet hall buzzed with energy.

Alexander sat at the head table, deep in conversation with Harrison, his presence alone warding off unwanted interruptions.

Few dared approach when the Sinclair patriarch was in such a formidable mood.

After a few glasses of wine, Harrison was in high spirits and summoned his children to join them.

Mr. Langley gestured for Sebastian to take a seat beside Alexander.

"Alexander, what do you think of Sebastian?" Harrison asked, grinning.

Alexander offered a polite smile. "Mr. Vanderbilt is undoubtedly talented. The younger generation continues to impress."

Harrison coughed, wondering how Alexander had built an empire with such blunt diplomacy.

Sebastian was Harrison’s son. Praising the son over the father wasn’t exactly tactful.

"Ha! Sebastian’s nothing compared to me at his age. I had twice his vision!" Harrison boasted. "Though I will say—he’s got a good heart. His flaw? Stubbornness. Never listens to me."

His tone was laced with disappointment.

Sebastian remained silent, sipping his coffee with an unreadable expression.

"Sebastian isn’t as bad as you make him out to be," Richard interjected. "As CEO, his results speak for themselves. Among his peers, he’s unmatched."

He wasn’t just defending Sebastian—he was defending his own pride. He couldn’t let Alexander think the Vanderbilts were weak.

"Hmph. That’s his job. If he can’t lead, I’ll find someone who can!" Harrison snapped, clearly enjoying needling Richard.

"Men like Sebastian are rare in New York," Alexander said smoothly. "He’s set a standard for others to follow."

Since Sebastian took over, Vanderbilt Industries had soared. His reforms made it the top conglomerate in three years.

Harrison’s criticism was just a front. Alexander could see the pride beneath.

"Ah! So you admire him?" Harrison’s grin widened. "Perhaps our families should strengthen ties. A marriage, perhaps?"

The table froze.

Sebastian’s expression darkened. "Don’t joke."

Alexander raised a brow.

"Alexander, you have three daughters, yes? Any new additions?" Harrison pressed.

"Still just the three. Nine children total—that’s enough."

"And are they married?"

"My eldest, Arabella, is wed overseas. My youngest, Lillian, is still in school. Too young for such things."

"Ah, but your favorite—what was her name again?"

Alexander’s gaze softened. "Isabella."

Sebastian’s hand twitched at the name, his jaw tightening.

"Yes! Isabella! I remember her as a child—well-mannered, beautiful. She must be in her mid-twenties now? Any suitors?"

"None."

"So, what do you think of Sebastian?"

Alexander nearly choked. Was Harrison seriously suggesting this?

"I’m engaged," Sebastian bit out. "Even if I weren’t, Isabella Sinclair is out of my league."

Harrison opened his mouth, but Alexander cut in, frowning. "Mr. Vanderbilt, are you implying my daughter isn’t good enough? I wouldn’t marry her to a prince, yet you dismiss her without a thought? That’s bold."

If Harrison weren’t here, Alexander would’ve been far harsher.

Sebastian had nerve.

"Isabella is exceptional. We’ve crossed paths in business. She’s brilliant, fearless—equal to any man." Sebastian’s tone was neutral, but his eyes were stormy. "But we’re incompatible. That line won’t be crossed."

"Enough with the excuses! I’ll arrange a meeting tomorrow. Maybe this ‘incompatibility’ is just in your head!" Harrison slammed his palm on the table. "It’s settled!"

Desperate to stop Sebastian from marrying Vanessa, Harrison was playing matchmaker blindly.

Sebastian’s expression turned thunderous. Before he could refuse, Elspeth blurted, "Sebastian’s marrying Vanessa! Introducing Isabella now is inappropriate!"

"They’re not married yet." Harrison’s smile vanished. "Business and marriage aren’t so different. Until the papers are signed, anything can change."

"But their engagement’s public! What would people think of Isabella?" Elspeth scoffed. "She’s Alexander’s treasure. The Vanderbilts can’t toy with her!"

"Elspeth, enough!" Richard yanked her back, fearing Harrison’s temper.

Harrison’s face reddened with rage.

Alexander watched silently, sipping his wine.

The Vanderbilts were a circus. No sane man would let his daughter near them.

As Harrison’s coughing worsened, Richard, Sebastian, and Mr. Langley rushed to his side.

"Stop crowding me! Where’s Natalia? Get her here—now!" Harrison barked.

In his heart, Natalia was his favorite. Without her, he couldn’t breathe right.

"Speaking of, where is Miss Natalia? I haven’t seen her," Glynnis asked innocently, hiding her smirk.

Just then, Vanessa glided over.

"Vanessa, have you seen Natalia? Harrison’s asking for her," Glynnis pressed.

"I have." Vanessa fidgeted, eyes darting. "But... I’m not sure I should say."
###Chapter 105

Acacia's words sent a jolt of panic through Hamiltion. His fingers twitched nervously. "What's wrong? Is Isabella alright?"

Thaddeus tensed, his jaw clenching.

"Just say it, Acacia." Elspeth's voice was smooth, but her eyes gleamed with cold amusement. "We're all family here."

Acacia feigned hesitation before speaking. "I was walking through the VIP wing and saw Ms. Sinclair and President Kingsley entering a room together. President Kingsley seemed... intoxicated. I assumed Ms. Sinclair was helping him."

She blinked innocently. "At first, I was concerned, but then I remembered—they are officially together now. So it shouldn't be a problem, right?"

Thaddeus's knuckles turned white.

Emeric shot to his feet, confusion twisting his features. "Who is Alexander with? Who is this Isabella?"

Acacia shrank back, casting a nervous glance at Thaddeus.

A sharp pain pulsed through Thaddeus's temples. Without a word, he turned and strode out.

Acacia hid a smirk.

This was it. The moment Isabella would be humiliated beyond repair.

"Someone answer me!" Emeric demanded, veins standing out on his forehead. "Who the hell is Isabella?"

Alexander had always been the pride of the Kingsley family. The idea of him entangled with some woman—especially another man's wife—was unthinkable.

"You didn't know, Chairman Emeric?" Elspeth widened her eyes in mock surprise. "Mr. Kingsley and Ms. Sinclair just announced their relationship at the birthday gala. I saw Evelyn and Ms. Sinclair getting along famously at the charity auction. I assumed you approved."

"Evelyn knew her?" Emeric's face darkened.

So both his son and daughter had been swayed by this woman.

"Enough!" Hamiltion snapped, his protective instincts flaring. "Isabella and Mr. Kingsley's affairs are their own business!"

Elspeth's lips curved. "Oh, but it is our business. Ms. Sinclair and Thaddeus only signed divorce papers—the process isn't finalized. Legally, she's still an Abernathy."

She sighed dramatically. "We planned to announce Thaddeus and Acacia's engagement after your birthday. Acacia has suffered in silence, but now Ms. Sinclair flaunts her relationship with President Kingsley at your celebration? The disrespect is staggering."

Acacia and Glynnis exchanged smug glances.

Emeric's mind went blank.

His son—the man who had never so much as glanced at a woman—was involved with Thaddeus's wife?

Disaster.

Thaddeus sprinted down the corridor, his polished composure shattered.

He was a man of control, of calculated elegance. But the thought of Isabella and Alexander together—it unraveled him.

When he reached the door, his breath came in ragged gasps. Sweat dampened his collar.

What had happened inside? How far had it gone?

His chest burned.

Just as he raised his fist, the door swung open.

Isabella stood there, disheveled, supporting a barely conscious Alexander. At the sight of Thaddeus, she froze.

His hand hung mid-air. "Did he touch you?" The words tore from his throat, raw and desperate.

Isabella laughed bitterly. "Oh, so you're here to mock us?"

"Answer me!"

"President Kingsley was drugged at your event!" Her eyes blazed. "I stabilized him, but he needs a hospital. Now move!"

She shoved past him, but Thaddeus caught her arm, fingers digging in.

"Let. Go." Her voice was ice.

"You'd choose him over me?" His grip tightened. "After everything?"

Isabella wrenched free. "If anything happens to him because of your family's scheming, I swear—I'll burn the Abernathys to the ground."

The words carved into him, deeper than any blade.

Then—footsteps.

"Isabella!" Hamiltion's voice rang out.

She turned slowly.

And there, standing beside the Abernathys, was Emeric.

Recognition flashed across his face. Shock. Disbelief.

Isabella's blood ran cold.

"Dad," she whispered.

The room erupted.

Acacia seized her moment. "See? Ms. Sinclair can't even wait for the divorce! She throws herself at President Kingsley, humiliating Mr. Hamiltion on his birthday!"

Thaddeus snarled, "Shut your mouth!"

But the damage was done.

Emeric's expression darkened. "Isabella," he said slowly. "Come here."

Silence fell.

Isabella took a shaky step forward. "Dad."

The word hung in the air, heavy with shame.
###Chapter 106

Evadne's voice, soft yet razor-sharp, sent shockwaves through the room.

Hamilton and Frederic stood frozen, mouths agape.

Acacia felt ice crawl down her spine, her face ghostly pale. Elspeth and Glynnis were no better—stunned into silence.

Who would’ve thought? This woman they’d dismissed as insignificant was actually Emeric’s daughter, the hidden heiress of the Ashbourne empire!

Glynnis tugged at Elspeth’s sleeve, frantic. “Is this real?”

Elspeth shoved her off, hissing, “Shut up!”

Thaddeus reeled, his mind spinning. How could this be? The woman who’d cared for his grandfather as a nurse, who’d endured his indifference as his wife—she was Evadne Ashbourne?

He stepped forward, forcing his bloodshot eyes to focus on her face—familiar yet suddenly foreign.

Evadne turned away, avoiding his gaze. Whether from guilt or irritation, she wanted nothing to do with him.

“So it’s really you?” His voice was rough, uncertain.

“Yes.” Her reply was cold, unwavering.

“You’re the one who retaliated against Stirling Group. You made me climb ten floors.”

“Don’t bother asking. It was all me.” She cut him off, her tone glacial. “I’m the GM of K World Hotel. I’m Emeric’s daughter, Evadne. But don’t flatter yourself. Everything I did was for the hotel’s interests, not against you. As for that night, I sent a stand-in to avoid complications. I hid my identity so we could end things cleanly.”

She paused, lowering her head. “I lied to you. I’m sorry.”

The deception was worse this time. Yet, Thaddeus wasn’t as furious as he expected. He needed to know—why?

Why give up wealth to be a nurse? Why marry him knowing he didn’t love her?

“And Cassius? Arnold Ashbourne?”

“My brothers. Same parents.”

With that, she walked away, leaving Thaddeus standing there, his chest tight.

Jason rushed over, piecing things together at a glance. “Chairman Emeric, Ms. Evadne.”

“Help Cassius,” Emeric ordered, jaw clenched. “He’s too drunk for Evadne to handle alone.”

Jason moved to assist. Thaddeus reached out, but Evadne’s icy glare stopped him.

“We don’t need your help.”

His hand dropped, awkward and rejected.

Evadne turned to Jason. “Call the Ashbourne family doctor. Cassius needs his stomach pumped.”

“Pumped? He’s just drunk—”

“He was drugged.” Her gaze sliced through the Abernathy family. “His reaction isn’t from alcohol.”

Shock rippled through the room.

The Abernathy women paled—especially Glynnis, her legs trembling.

Emeric’s expression darkened. He’d known something was off. Cassius never lost control like this.

Jason helped Cassius out.

Hamilton, livid, demanded, “Evadne, explain!”

Even now, he called her by her old name.

Frederic, pride wounded, snapped, “This is absurd! Our estate is secure. No outsider could’ve done this!”

“Believe what you want.” Evadne’s chin lifted, regal and unyielding. “But if your security’s tight, then the culprit is one of yours.”

Frederic’s face twisted, but he had no rebuttal.

Acacia shrank back, panic-stricken.

Glynnis’s heart hammered. This wasn’t the plan! Cassius was supposed to be fine, and Evadne was supposed to be ruined!

She shot Acacia a venomous glare. Useless coward.

Elspeth, sweating, interjected, “Ms. Evadne, surely you’re mistaken. Why would we harm Cassius?”

“Enough!” Hamilton roared.

Elspeth flinched, seething.

Evadne remained calm. “Cassius wasn’t the target. I was.”

Thaddeus’s eyes narrowed. The pieces clicked—Elspeth’s sudden exposure, Cassius’s condition, Evadne’s identity reveal. Too convenient.

“After I sang, a maid said Cassius was unwell. I went to check on him.” Her fists clenched. “He protected me. Hurt himself to stay conscious. They didn’t know I was an Ashbourne. They thought they could destroy me.”

Emeric’s voice was steel. “Frederic, you owe me answers. Or I’ll tear your reputation apart myself.”

Frederic sputtered, “This is a misunderstanding!”

“I don’t care whose fault it is. It happened under your roof. Fix it.”

“You’re being unreasonable!”

Emeric smirked. “Or are you too scared to investigate?”

Frederic’s face purpled with rage.

Evadne’s eyes warmed. For all his flaws, Emeric defended his family fiercely.

Acacia’s dress clung to her, drenched in sweat. Glynnis edged toward the door—until Jareth’s voice froze her.

“Going somewhere, Glynnis?”

She whirled, terror spiking.

Jareth stood there, icy-eyed, cradling a sleeping girl in his arms.

Mari Abernathy.

Glynnis’s hatred burned. The girl in his arms—the one he protected—was her stepsister.
###Chapter 107

Isabella lay curled in Alexander's embrace, her fingers tangled in his crisp white shirt. Her eyelashes trembled like butterfly wings against flushed cheeks. Alexander studied her peaceful expression, the memory of their unexpected kiss sending electric currents through his veins.

But he was no inexperienced boy. With practiced ease, he schooled his features into neutrality.

When his gaze shifted to Gabrielle, it turned razor-sharp. "Leaving so soon, Miss Moreau? The night's just getting interesting."

"I...I need the ladies' room," Gabrielle stammered, beads of sweat forming at her temples.

"That can wait." Alexander tightened his hold on Isabella, striding toward Evelyn and Nathaniel.

As he passed Gabrielle, her eyes widened at the constellation of red marks visible above his collar.

Her blood ran cold.

If Alexander hadn't been drugged...then who had left those telltale marks?

A soft whimper escaped Isabella's lips as she stirred restlessly.

Gabrielle's stomach dropped. That naive little fool had gotten to him first!

"Isabella!" Evelyn and Nathaniel exclaimed simultaneously.

"What happened to my daughter?" Harrison demanded, his face draining of color at seeing Isabella cradled in Alexander's arms.

"Relax, Mr. Lockwood. She's in excellent hands," Alexander assured them, adjusting his grip.

"Excellent hands?" Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "If you've taken advantage—"

"Really now," Alexander chuckled awkwardly, avoiding eye contact. "You make me sound like some predator."

Evelyn's sharp eyes caught the marks on his neck. Her expression darkened, but she held her tongue.

"Explain yourself!" Reginald commanded.

Alexander's voice turned glacial. "Isabella was drugged. I found her unconscious in the garden. Administered activated charcoal and kept her hydrated. She'll recover after proper rest."

The revelation sent shockwaves through the room.

Eleanor and Seraphina turned ghostly pale.

"Drugged? Again?" Harrison swayed dangerously.

"Steady him!" Reginald barked as he and Lawrence rushed to support the trembling man.

"Mr. Lockwood!" Evelyn moved to assist, her concern evident.

Dominic sneered, jealousy twisting his features at her attention to another man.

"The pattern's clear now." Evelyn's piercing gaze swept between Gabrielle and Seraphina.

"Only Nathaniel and Alexander were with Christian earlier. Yet another victim—Isabella—who was absent all evening, shows identical symptoms. Obviously, the tainted drink meant for Christian was accidentally consumed by Isabella instead."

Nathaniel and Alexander exchanged impressed glances.

Her razor-sharp deduction had unraveled the mystery in moments.

"So who was the real target? Surely not Nathaniel—no Abernathy would sabotage their own event." With calculated precision, Evelyn redirected all suspicion toward Alexander.

Alexander's lips pressed into a thin line, his eyes frosting over.

Such underhanded tactics disgusted him. That someone dared attempt this at Harrison's celebration was unforgivable.

"First, detain the maid in question," Nathaniel ordered, his voice like shattering ice. "No one leaves until we uncover the truth."

Evelyn blinked in surprise at his decisive action.

Their eyes met—a silent understanding passing between them.

"Nathaniel! Are we prisoners now? Suspects?" Eleanor protested shrilly, sensing the noose tightening.

"Merely ensuring full cooperation to expose the culprit," Nathaniel countered, his commanding presence dwarfing even Reginald's. "Unless you've something to hide?"

"Quite right!" Harrison regained his composure, fury replacing distress. "This outrage demands answers! We owe justice to Isabella and Christian!"

Gabrielle's teeth chattered uncontrollably. Eleanor found herself speechless.

At that moment, Preston entered with two security guards dragging the terrified maid.

With a sharp gesture, he sent her sprawling at their feet.

"Good work," Nathaniel acknowledged. "The surveillance footage?"

"Already reviewed, sir. We intercepted her attempting to flee through the service exit—quite the damning choice."

Evelyn's eyebrows rose. When had he orchestrated this swift response?

"Running only confirms guilt," Alexander observed icily. "Innocent people don't bolt."

"Interrogation will reveal everything," Nathaniel stated, his tone promising consequences. "I want the mastermind."

"I swear, I know nothing!" the maid cried. "My child fell ill—I was rushing home!"

"You served the drinks," Alexander pointed out.

"And directed me to attend Christian," Evelyn added coolly.

Preston produced a phone displaying security footage. "No one else handled the beverages, sir."

"Then prove I poisoned them!" the maid challenged desperately.

Evelyn tilted her head. "Curious. We never mentioned poison. How did you know?"

The maid flushed scarlet under the sudden weight of suspicious stares.

"I...I overheard earlier."

"Remarkable hearing," Preston mocked, handing Nathaniel the phone. "But footage shows her discarding evidence."

Nathaniel examined the screen as Evelyn leaned in. Their foreheads accidentally brushed—both freezing at the unexpected contact.

The video clearly showed the maid disposing of a small vial near the garden bins.

"She missed the hidden camera in the hedges," Preston explained smugly. "Amateur mistake."

"No! That was just my migraine medication!" the maid wailed.

"Evidence retrieval?" Nathaniel inquired calmly.

Preston produced sealed plastic bags containing the vials. "Residue remains for testing."

"To the lab immediately. If this isn't prescription medication, arrest her for attempted poisoning."

Seeing escape impossible, the maid collapsed at Nathaniel's feet.

"Mercy, sir! I was coerced!" Her trembling finger pointed at Gabrielle. "She made me do it!"
###Chapter 108

The piercing gazes of the crowd pinned Glynnis like a butterfly under glass.

"Glynnis, is this true?" Hamiltion's voice trembled with disbelief.

Jareth remained impassive, his cold stare fixed on her panic-stricken face.

If not for Mari accidentally sipping that tainted wine, she would have fallen victim to this deceitful trap.

Evadne stood composed, her lashes casting delicate shadows. A knowing smirk played at the corner of her lips—she saw through the charade.

"You vile creature! How dare you accuse me?" Glynnis shrieked, lunging forward, only to be yanked back by Elspeth. "I'm the Abernathy heiress! Do you comprehend the consequences of slandering me?"

Her bravado was hollow. Inside, her pulse raced like a cornered hare.

Betraying Acacia wasn't an option—it would be confessing her own guilt.

Sweat slicked Glynnis's palms. Only now did she grasp Acacia's cunning ploy.

"Such malice! The Abernathys treat staff generously, yet you drugged men to seduce them! Caught red-handed, you drag Glynnis into your filth? Over a mere scolding, you'd ruin her? Pathetic!"

Elspeth clung to Frederic's arm. "Call the police immediately! This wretch must pay for defaming our daughter!"

Frederic, certain of Glynnis's innocence, barked, "Restrain her! Notify the authorities!"

"It wasn't me! Glynnis ordered it! She promised me wealth—no more servitude! Glynnis, speak! Admit it!" The maid's furious screams echoed.

Elspeth signaled guards to haul the woman away. No evidence meant no threat.

Evadne controlled the narrative, yet suspicion gnawed at her.

Three years among the Abernathys taught her Glynnis lacked the cunning for such schemes. This reeked of Elspeth's machinations—or worse, Acacia's.

A glimpse of Acacia's smug smirk confirmed Evadne's theory.

Rage simmered, but she schooled her features.

Accusations without proof were reckless. She wouldn't hand Acacia ammunition.

"The Abernathys' negligence allowed this viper into our midst, causing you distress," Frederic told Emeric stiffly. "Our deepest apologies."

Emeric's smile didn't reach his eyes.

Thaddeus, unsatisfied, countered coldly, "This was clearly—"

"Since Mr. Frederic has apologized and the culprit is dealt with, let's end tonight's unpleasantness," Evadne interjected. "Father, Cassius and I are unharmed. The Ashbournes and Abernathys are esteemed families. A public scandal benefits none. Forgiveness serves us best."

Thaddeus studied her, baffled.

This wasn't the Evadne he knew.

The Evadne who'd once raged like a storm to protect Cassius wouldn't surrender so easily.

Unless... she was orchestrating a deadlier strike.

Hearing Evadne address Emeric as "Father" stunned Jareth into silence.

How had he missed that Evadne now had a powerhouse father?

This widened the chasm between them irreparably.

"At Evadne's request, I accept your apology," Emeric said icily, though resentment simmered beneath.

Glynnis sagged against Elspeth, who swiftly escorted her away.

The grand birthday gala crumbled into disgrace.

Hamiltion's celebration was ruined. Emeric and Evadne took their leave.

As the Abernathys bid farewell, Thaddeus lingered beside Evadne, words lodged in his throat.

Emeric's glare could have vaporized Thaddeus on the spot. This man had married his precious daughter? Unforgivable luck.

"Chairman Emeric!" Acacia fluttered forward, doe-eyed. "About tonight—I'm so sorry! I never realized Ms. Evadne was your daughter. I misunderstood her relationship with Mr. Cassius—"

Emeric didn't break stride. "Ms. Acacia, are you suggesting it's acceptable to slander women unrelated to me?"

"N-no! That's not—" Acacia blanched.

Thaddeus recalled her venomous accusations earlier. Disgust curdled in his gut.

"Advice, Ms. Acacia: judge not lest you be judged. Words scar deeper than blades. Imagine if your target lacked means to defend herself. Shameful behavior."

Emeric quickened his pace.

Acacia watched the group depart, Thaddeus ignoring her. Ice slithered down her spine.

Outside, a fleet of luxury cars awaited. Jason and bodyguards stood at attention.

"Evadne! Wait!" Hamiltion clutched her hand, tears glistening. "Why hide your identity? Why serve as my nurse?"

Evadne sighed. "The Ashbourne-Abernathy feud barred our union. My true name would've exiled me from your side."

Emeric and Frederic exchanged glances. Thaddeus's chest constricted.

"Silly girl! Ancient grudges mean nothing! If you love each other, be together! I bless your marriage!"

Evadne chuckled softly.

"Mr. Hamiltion, I'm no saint. I deceived you. And Thaddeus and I... we never loved each other. Our divorce proceeds as planned."

Thaddeus's breath hitched.

"Though I'll no longer be Evadne Abernathy, you'll always be my dear Mr. Hamiltion. Live long and well."

They embraced tightly, Hamiltion weeping openly.

As Evadne turned to leave, Thaddeus finally snapped.

"Answer me one thing."

She paused, expression frosty.

"Did you marry me under false pretenses solely because of our families' history?"

His lips trembled. His gaze burned into her.

"Yes." Her reply was curt, dismissive.

"Why?" His voice cracked. "You're Ashbourne royalty. You didn't need this marriage. You knew it was temporary. Why agree?"
###Chapter 109

A Marriage of Convenience?!

Emeric's blood boiled with rage. The urge to punch Thaddeus square in the jaw was overwhelming, but what stunned him more was Evadne's revelation.

He had always known his daughter was fearless—reckless enough to charge into a battlefield without hesitation. But this?

Disappearing for three years only to secretly marry his sworn enemy's son? And not just any marriage—a contract marriage?

Emeric's fingers twitched. He wanted to crack open her skull and see what the hell she'd been thinking.

Thaddeus's vision blurred, his chest tightening as if an invisible hand was crushing his ribs.

Now, she was walking away. Just like that. Three years of their life together, reduced to ashes in a single night.

But he couldn't let it end like this. Not without answers.

"If I remember correctly," Evadne's voice was ice, her gaze sharp as a blade, "we first met three years ago. When Mr. Hamiltion proposed our marriage, why didn’t you refuse?"

Thaddeus flinched.

"Why bother asking now?" She tilted her head, lips curling in a mocking smile. "Maybe I was bored. Maybe I wanted to see what it was like to be married to a man like you. Lucky for me, Mr. Hamiltion handed me the opportunity."

"Evadne." His voice cracked, raw and desperate. "I just want the truth."

"The truth?" She scoffed. "Let it go, Thaddeus. Dwelling on the past is pointless."

She extended her hand—cool, composed, as if they were nothing more than business rivals now.

"In the future, we might compete in the same circles. Don’t hold back on my account."

He stared at her outstretched fingers, his stomach twisting. If he took her hand, it would be over. Really over.

Evadne waited a beat, then shrugged and turned away.

The engine roared to life. Just as the car began to pull away, she rolled down the window, her face framed by the night.

Thaddeus's breath hitched.

"Nine a.m. tomorrow," she said, voice crisp. "The courthouse. Don’t be late."

The tires rolled over the pavement—and over his heart.

Behind him, Hamiltion wiped his eyes discreetly. Frederic's expression was unreadable.

"What?" Hamiltion sneered. "Now that she’s gone, you suddenly realize how good she was?"

Frederic clenched his jaw.

"Like father, like son," Hamiltion muttered. "Blind to what’s right in front of you."

Frederic had no retort.

The girl they’d dismissed as a nobody—the quiet, unassuming caregiver—was the heiress to the Ashbourne fortune.

If the world had known Thaddeus married her, the Abernathy name would’ve soared overnight.

Now? It was all dust.

The car sped through the darkened streets. Evadne stared out the window, her reflection ghostly against the glass.

Thaddeus’s question echoed in her skull.

Why did you marry me?

His eyes had been shattered. Broken. As if she had betrayed him.

Her nails dug into her palms.

No.

Pitying a man was the first step to ruin.

If Thaddeus had ever loved her, three years would’ve been enough. His pain now? Just wounded pride.

"So," Emeric growled, fists clenched, "why did you marry him?"

Evadne exhaled sharply. "Drop it, Emeric. It’s done."

"The hell it is!" His roar made the driver flinch. "You married that Abernathy brat in secret! If not for Hamiltion’s party, were you planning to hide it forever?"

"Why did you even come?" she deflected. "Did Frederic invite you?"

"Don’t change the subject!"

Evadne pressed her fingers to her lips, then smirked. "Because Thaddeus is pretty."

"Pretty?!" Emeric spluttered. "My sons are all better-looking than him!"

"And which of your sons could I legally marry?"

Emeric choked.

"How much did they pay you?" he demanded. "Jewels? Stocks? Mansions? If Frederic knew who you were, he’d have paraded you through the streets with fireworks!"

"I used a fake name," she reminded him dryly. "They had no idea I was your daughter. And I didn’t want the spectacle."

The thought of the Abernathys mistreating his girl made Emeric see red. He’d bankrupt them by dawn.

"You lowered yourself for him," he hissed. "You’re not this stupid, Evadne. What the hell happened?"

She wasn’t stupid.

She’d just loved him.

"Thaddeus was good to me," she said softly, squeezing Emeric’s hand. "No regrets. I’m back now, safe and sound."

Emeric exhaled, shoulders sagging. "Fine. That unlucky girl was his ex-wife—not my Evadne. You’re still the queen of the damn hill."

"Exactly." She leaned into him, resting her head on his shoulder.

The past was dead.

Time to move on.
###Chapter 110

The banquet ended with Hamilton deeply concerned about Mari's condition. He immediately summoned his personal physician to examine her. Only when the doctor confirmed she was fine did he finally relax.

In the dimly lit corridor, two striking figures leaned against the windowsill, the city lights casting long shadows behind them.

Thaddeus offered a cigarette to Jareth, who accepted it with a smirk. The flame flickered between them as Jareth took a slow drag, exhaling a cloud of smoke into the night air.

"So. Her real name is Evadne. Emeric's daughter?"

Jareth felt like he'd been struck by lightning. The revelation was too surreal to process.

"Correct." Thaddeus tapped his cigarette, the ash drifting to the floor like fallen snow.

"Holy hell, Thad. You hit the damn jackpot and didn’t even know it." Jareth clapped him on the back, eyes gleaming with amusement. "You were married to the Ashbourne heiress. If you hadn’t divorced her, you’d have Emeric’s empire backing you. Frederic and that scheming Elspeth would be groveling at your feet. The entire Abernathy Group would be yours to command."

"I don’t need Evadne’s name to control the Abernathy Group." Thaddeus exhaled sharply, shooting Jareth a dark look. "Do I look like a man who climbs the ladder using a woman?"

"No, you’re not. You’re the kind who buries himself in work instead of enjoying life." Jareth sighed dramatically. "Still, what a wasted opportunity. You could’ve shaved off a decade of struggle."

Thaddeus crushed his cigarette underfoot, a hollow ache settling in his chest. But his regret wasn’t for the reasons Jareth assumed.

"I still don’t understand why she married me in the first place."

"Neither do I." Jareth smirked. "You’re moody, emotionally stunted, hung up on someone else, and—let’s be honest—probably terrible in bed. She’d have been better off with me."

Thaddeus’s gaze turned lethal. "Jareth. Do you honestly think Emeric would let his daughter marry you?"

"At least I wouldn’t accuse her of cheating every time she breathed near another man." Jareth grinned. "In Evadne’s eyes, that already makes me the better man, don’t you think?"

He chuckled. "Remember how you used to pick fights with her over Cassius? Said all those ugly things? Bet you’re choking on those words now."

"Why did she hide her identity from me?" Thaddeus growled. "Why didn’t she tell me the truth?"

"You’re divorced. What difference would it make now?" Jareth shrugged. "Besides, if you’d trusted her even a little, you wouldn’t have treated her the way you did. That’s why I say you two were doomed from the start. No love, no loyalty, no trust. Three years of putting up with you—I admire her patience. I wouldn’t have lasted a day."

Jareth, suddenly the expert on relationships, dissected Thaddeus’s flaws with brutal precision.

Thaddeus clenched his fists, veins standing out against his skin.

Jareth patted his shoulder, grinning. "Don’t worry, buddy. I’ve learned from your mistakes. Whether she’s na or Evadne, I’ll make sure she falls for me. Wish me luck."

"Get lost."

If looks could kill, Jareth would be six feet under.

"Fine, fine. Enemies when we’re close, friends when we’re apart." Jareth paused before leaving, curiosity flickering in his eyes. "You’re not just going to let tonight slide, are you?"

"There’s something off about Elspeth and her daughter." Thaddeus’s voice was dangerously low. "But even with proof, Frederic will bury it. He won’t let the family’s dirty laundry go public. I’ll handle them my own way."

"Lucky Evadne’s unharmed. If anything had happened to her, Elspeth and Glynnis would be in handcuffs right now." Jareth whistled.

The thought alone made Thaddeus’s blood boil. If Evadne had been hurt, he wouldn’t have hesitated to destroy them.

A sharp, unfamiliar protectiveness surged through him.

"What about your fiancée?" Jareth raised a brow. "She was the first to step forward and describe the scene to Emeric. Don’t you find that suspicious?"

Thaddeus frowned, torn between logic and lingering sentiment.

He didn’t believe in coincidences.

But with Acacia, he wanted to believe.

"Mr. Thaddeus!" Gordon rushed over, phone in hand. "The surveillance footage you requested—Elspeth, Glynnis, and Ms. Acacia’s movements tonight. It’s all here."

"Efficient as always." Jareth lingered, intrigued.

Thaddeus scanned the footage, tension coiling in his shoulders.

"Ms. Acacia not only interacted frequently with Elspeth but also met privately with Glynnis." Gordon’s expression darkened. "But here’s the strange part—she never appeared near the room where Mr. Cassius and Ms. Evadne were."

Jareth smirked. "Interesting. If she wasn’t there, how did she know what happened inside?"

Thaddeus’s jaw tightened, realization hitting him like a freight train.

Meanwhile, the Abernathy family gathered in the grand hall, Acacia among them.

Glynnis, pale and trembling, clung to Elspeth, playing the victim. Frederic’s blind support shielded her from suspicion.

But Glynnis’s glare at Acacia was venomous. She wanted to claw that innocent mask right off her face.

"Who would’ve thought a fraud infiltrated our family?" Elspeth sneered, still seething over Evadne’s grand reveal.

"Right. She deceived Thaddeus for three years. What was her endgame?" Acacia feigned concern.

Hamilton scoffed. "You keep calling her a fraud. What exactly did she steal? Money? Power? She left with nothing. Meanwhile, you bullied her for years. Don’t think I didn’t notice."

Frederic stiffened. "Elspeth was just being cautious."

"Cautious?" Hamilton laughed. "You only care now because she’s Emeric’s daughter. Too late for regrets. You let an heiress slip through your fingers and settled for a woman from a tainted family. How’s that working out for you?"

Frederic’s face burned with humiliation.

Elspeth seethed, but Evadne’s status was untouchable. She was Emeric’s blood, leagues above Acacia.

Thaddeus stepped forward, but Acacia cut in, voice trembling.

"Mr. Hamilton, I know you despise me. But love isn’t measured by wealth. Thaddeus and I share something Evadne could never understand—a bond forged through hardship."

She turned to Thaddeus, desperation in her eyes. "Tell them, Thaddeus."

He looked down at her, cold detachment replacing warmth.

Memories of their past flickered, then faded into nothingness.

His voice was hollow.

"The wedding is postponed."
###Chapter 111

Thaddeus's voice was ice-cold, devoid of emotion.

But to Acacia, it felt like a knife twisting in her gut.

She froze, her cheeks burning as if she'd been slapped repeatedly.

Frederic and Elspeth were stunned, while Glynnis smirked in triumph.

Tonight had exposed Acacia's true nature. This woman, who treated her like a pawn, wasn't fit to be an Abernathy. She needed to be crushed—permanently.

"Thaddeus, are you really giving up on me?" Acacia clutched his arm desperately, tears streaming. "Just because Evadne is an Ashbourne? You're throwing away everything we had?"

"Evadne has nothing to do with this." Thaddeus wrenched his arm free, his gaze frigid. "I warned you to leave her alone. Yet you slandered her, dragged her into the spotlight. What's your problem with her?"

"That's not true! I just wanted you to see her for who she really is!"

Acacia lunged for him, but he stepped back, leaving her stumbling forward, nearly falling.

"She's been manipulating you from the start! And for her, you'd throw away ten years? Doesn't that hurt?"

"She lied, but she never hurt me." Thaddeus's eyes darkened with regret. "We're done. This isn't working."

Acacia watched him walk away, her throat tightening like invisible hands were choking her.

How had it come to this?

Her dream wedding—gone? No. She wouldn't let Evadne ruin this.

"Thaddeus isn't blind. He knows right from wrong." Hamiltion scoffed, his face red with anger. "You played yourself, twisting the truth, bullying Evadne."

"Her name is Evadne now," Mr. Murray corrected quietly.

"Same difference!" Hamiltion waved him off.

Acacia's nails dug into her palms, humiliation burning through her.

Glynnis laughed openly beside her, relishing every second.

"Let's go, Mr. Murray! I need a drink!"

"You've had enough."

"Today's a celebration! Don't ruin my mood."

Hamiltion left, still muttering.

The room was thick with tension.

"Darling, you have to talk to Thaddeus!" Elspeth gripped Frederic's arm. "The engagement's been announced—he can't back out now!"

Frederic scowled. "Since when does Thaddeus listen to anyone? He didn't even tell me about the divorce."

"But this is different! He never loved Evadne, but he and Acacia have history!"

"If their bond was so strong, why did she keep provoking Evadne? She embarrassed us tonight. I won't help her."

Frederic stormed off, leaving Elspeth seething.

Acacia's eyes were swollen, her breath ragged.

"Serves you right!" Glynnis sneered. "You used me, then stabbed me in the back. Did you really think you'd win?"

"I never used you!" Acacia shot back. "You chose to go after Jareth on your own. That mess is on you!"

"You're blaming me now?" Glynnis's face twisted with rage. "I'll tear that lying mouth apart!"

She grabbed Acacia's hair, yanking out a diamond pin and a fistful of strands. Acacia shrieked in pain.

Elspeth watched the brawl, disgusted.

"Enough!" she roared.

The women froze, still gripping each other.

"Let go. Now."

They released each other, panting.

"Glynnis, leave. I need to speak with Acacia."

Glynnis glared but obeyed.

Acacia stood trembling, her dress crumpled.

A real lady wouldn't act like this. But what choice did she have?

Elspeth only saw her as a pawn.

"About tonight—"

Slap!

Elspeth's palm struck Acacia's cheek with brutal force.
###Chapter 112

Acacia received a brutal reality check.

"I've warned you repeatedly—keep your schemes to yourself and leave Glynnis out of it!" Elspeth's voice was sharp as shattered glass. "Push me again, and I'll make sure you regret it!"

"I was wrong. I acted without thinking. I swear it won't happen again!"

Acacia's pride burned, but she had no choice but to grovel before Elspeth.

Elspeth studied her with icy disdain.

If the Frost Group weren't stretched thin, she'd never tolerate a conniving, disobedient woman like Acacia near Thaddeus.

But tools had their uses. After years of investment, she wasn't about to discard this one now.

Tonight left a bitter taste, but necessity demanded she keep playing this game.

"That girl is Emeric Ashbourne's precious heiress now. You won’t lay a finger on her." Elspeth’s crimson lips twisted. "Your only focus is securing Thaddeus’s heart. Nothing else matters."

"But he’s already pulling away!" Acacia’s voice cracked. "Mr. Frederic said once Thaddeus decides to end things, no one can stop him!"

Tears spilled as her dream of wealth and status teetered on the edge.

"He hasn’t taken that step yet." Elspeth seized her shoulder, nails digging in. "Listen carefully. Stay home. Don’t contact him. Let everyone believe you’re heartbroken over him."

"Will that really work?"

"Sometimes, humiliation is necessary." Elspeth’s smile was venomous. "Remind him of what he’s losing. Make him remember why he chose you in the first place."

Thaddeus sat in his study, cigarette smoke curling around him like ghosts.

Evadne’s words echoed in his mind: "Nine tomorrow morning. Let’s finalize the divorce."

Sleep was impossible.

Meanwhile, Evadne had returned to her Elmsworth villa after visiting Cassius in the hospital.

She’d washed off the night’s exhaustion, eaten, and slept soundly—until her alarm blared at eight.

"You should’ve woken me earlier!"

She descended the stairs, earrings swaying, irritation clear in her frown.

Jason, still in his apron, admired her effortless beauty—flawless skin, bright eyes, lips like rose petals.

"You needed the rest," he said.

"Today’s not the day to oversleep!" She huffed. "If I’m late, that arrogant bastard will think I’m clinging to him."

Jason grinned. "Celebratory breakfast?"

"Pack it. I’ll eat in the car."

The Rolls-Royce glided through the city.

Evadne nibbled a sandwich while typing. "Any updates on Ada?"

"Her team’s stonewalling everyone," Jason muttered. "Abernathy hasn’t made progress either."

"Good. We’re still neck and neck."

"Every luxury hotel in the country is fighting for her wedding."

Evadne smirked. "She’ll choose between us and Abernathy. Keep pushing. When she arrives next month, I’ll close the deal myself."

Outside the courthouse, couples lined up at city hall, laughing and taking selfies.

The Rolls-Royce’s arrival turned heads.

"Thaddeus isn’t even here yet," Jason scoffed.

Evadne checked her watch. "Let him have his dramatic entrance. I’ve waited before."

Three years ago, she’d waited alone all day for him at their wedding registration.

Now, she wouldn’t waste another second on him.

Thirty minutes later, a taxi pulled up.

Jason gaped. "Did the great Thaddeus Abernathy take a cab?"

"Divorce isn’t exactly glamorous," Evadne drawled.

Thaddeus stepped out, impeccable in his gray-striped suit. The crowd buzzed—men envied, women swooned.

Evadne strode forward, drawing equal admiration.

"Mr. Thaddeus." Her voice was frosty.

His gaze locked onto hers. "Apologies. Traffic."

The lie hung between them, heavy as the past they were about to sever.
###Chapter 113

"No problem, just be there during office hours, alright? Let's not drag today's business into tomorrow."

Isabella's voice was icy as she strode toward the entrance, leaving Alexander behind.

Memories flooded back—three years ago, when they'd agreed to register their marriage. An emergency meeting at Aetheria had forced him to stay behind.

By the time he finished entertaining important clients, he realized he'd forgotten to tell her to reschedule.

The recollection was sharp, painful.

That day, the town hall had been nearly empty. Only Isabella remained, head bowed, her slender frame looking heartbreakingly alone.

He never imagined she'd wait all day.

He never thought such unwavering devotion existed.

Back then, Alexander wanted to apologize. But Mr. Dubois' demands, his own resistance to the arranged marriage, and Evelyn's departure at the time had stolen the words from his lips.

"Alexander, you're finally here!"

Even now, he could still see her radiant smile—bright as sunlight.

Back then, he didn’t understand what it would take for this woman to give up on him.

Now he knew. Abandonment. Cold, ruthless abandonment.

Guilt twisted inside him. Jaw tight, he followed Isabella through the doors.

"Are they here to get married? They look perfect together!"

"But neither seems happy."

"Probably fighting. Did you see how late he was? Deserves it!"

"That guy looks broke compared to her. Took a cab but acts like royalty. So many freeloaders these days."

Alexander's glare silenced the gossiping man instantly.

The divorce section.

They sat side by side before the clerk, handing over their documents.

The clerk hesitated. "Are you sure? Three years isn’t nothing."

"I don’t lack money, and neither does he. The maid cooks, his secretary handles his schedule. No complications." Isabella’s tone was frosty.

Alexander stayed silent.

The clerk processed the paperwork.

Isabella checked her watch. "Hurry up. I have places to be."

"No shared assets or children?" the clerk asked.

"None," Isabella replied.

Alexander clenched his jaw. He’d considered offering compensation, but now—with her as the Ashbourne heiress—it would only insult her.

"Sign here."

Isabella scrawled her name swiftly, then glanced at Alexander.

His hand trembled.

The pen clattered to the floor.

Isabella frowned, studying him properly for the first time.

His face was haggard, hair disheveled, coat dusty, collar torn.

What had he been doing?

She picked up the pen and shoved it toward him.

Finally, both signed. The clerk stamped the papers. It was done.

"Best of luck to you both."

Outside, Isabella stared at the divorce papers, emotions tangled.

The pain of his forced signature had faded. Now, relief settled in.

16:48

She’d given everything for love and paid the price. Now, back at Ashbourne Group, she’d focus on her career.

Men? Not worth her time.

"Alexander, I’ve got things to do. Take care."

She turned to leave.

"Isabella, wait—"

A thud.

She spun around, gasping.

Alexander had collapsed down the steps, face contorted in pain.

Though it was only a few steps, the fall looked brutal.

"Alexander!"

She rushed to help him up, but his arm shook violently.

"What’s wrong with you?"

"Nothing." Beads of sweat dotted his forehead.

"Tell me the truth. Now." Her voice brooked no argument.

Despite the pain, warmth flickered in his chest at her concern.

"Do you still care?"

Her lips twisted into a smirk. "I’d stop for a stray dog too. You’re a living being—no reason not to care."

His face paled further. He pushed her away.

"I don’t need your pity."

"Sudden loss of balance could mean cerebellar issues. Get checked."

"Is this revenge? Taking shots at me whenever you can?" His voice was cold.

"Don’t flatter yourself. I’m neither that petty nor that bored." She forced a laugh. "Frankly, I’m thrilled. Since you’re fine, I won’t waste another second on you. Goodbye."

Rage burned in Alexander’s bloodshot eyes.

The moment she released him, he staggered, collapsing against her.

Their bodies pressed together.

Her chest brushed his, making his breath hitch.

His trembling hand slid to her waist, gripping the curve of her red dress.

Mind or body—one was always out of control.

"Remove your hand." Her voice was steel. "Or I’ll chop it off and feed it to my pet crocodile."
###Chapter 114

Isabella Sinclair desperately wished she could transform into Seraphina Lockwood's pet alligator, Rex, and tear that insufferable man Nathaniel Prescott to shreds!

They'd been married for three years, yet always slept in separate bedrooms. Nathaniel had never even held Isabella's hand. Now, after their divorce, he suddenly couldn't keep his hands off her. Isabella was certain even the alligator would refuse to bite him.

Because honestly, the man was a complete psychopath.

Nathaniel felt a sharp pain in his chest, as if his heart had shattered.

Just then, a sleek Porsche pulled up, and Preston Walsh jumped out in a panic.

"Mr. Prescott!"

"Have you lost your mind, sir? After that horrific accident, you should've gone straight to the hospital! Do you have a death wish?"

"I'm fine," Nathaniel muttered, struggling to keep his eyes open as Isabella's face blurred before him. "You're the one who's insane."

Isabella froze. Suddenly everything made sense - his delayed arrival, his strange behavior, his inability to steady a pen.

He'd been in a car accident!

"Nathaniel, you idiot! Do you think your pretty face makes you immortal? Internal bleeding could leave you paralyzed!" Isabella shouted, concern lacing her anger.

After a heavy silence, Nathaniel replied, "Didn't you always want me gone? If I went to the hospital, the divorce would be delayed. Isn't this what you wanted?"

Isabella stiffened, then laughed coldly. "Absolutely. Consider this my gratitude."

"Isabella!"

Hearing the familiar voice, she whirled around.

Two gleaming luxury cars had arrived.

Sebastian Lockwood and Adrian Montgomery stood impeccably dressed, the latter holding a bouquet of crimson roses. Both smiled warmly at her.

"Sebastian! Adrian!" Isabella sprinted toward them, her face lighting up.

Nathaniel tasted bitterness on his tongue.

For three years, he'd stood outside the Sinclair mansion while warmth and laughter filled its halls. Always left in the cold.

Pathetic.

He didn't know whether to hate himself for being a fool or Isabella for deceiving him.

"Why are you here?" Isabella eyed Sebastian's injured hand worriedly. "You should be resting!"

"I'm tougher than I look," Sebastian reassured. "We missed your wedding, but we won't miss this milestone."

"Thank you," Isabella whispered, touched.

"Congratulations, Isabella! Free at last from the Prescott nightmare!" Adrian thrust the roses into her arms.

"Thank you!" She buried her nose in the fragrant blooms.

Adrian's voice carried clearly, his contempt for the Prescotts unmistakable.

Nathaniel's face twisted like he'd been hit by another truck.

From another vehicle emerged Vanessa, Arabella, and Seraphina, surrounding Isabella with hugs.

"You all came?" Isabella's eyes shimmered.

"Obviously!" Seraphina squeezed her tight.

"Oliver wanted to come too, but his presence would cause a scene," Vanessa explained.

"I understand," Isabella nodded.

Watching his ex-wife enveloped in familial love, Nathaniel felt physical pain.

For three years, he'd given her none of this affection. Why had she stayed, enduring his cruelty?

He needed answers. Now.

"It's Arabella Sinclair! The legendary actress!" Preston gaped. "My mother worships her!"

Nathaniel shot him a death glare. "Back to the office!"

Then darkness swallowed him.

"Mr. Prescott!"

When Nathaniel awoke, he found himself in a hospital bed.

"Isabella." Her name escaped his lips first.

"You fractured your wrist and have a concussion. Some cranial blood clots, but nothing fatal."

Isabella stood silhouetted against the window, breathtaking in the backlight.

While unconscious, Preston had told her everything - Nathaniel hadn't slept all night, his office thick with cigarette smoke.

"The accident happened because he was exhausted. Or maybe another migraine episode."

Isabella knew how debilitating Nathaniel's headaches could be. He rarely drove because of them.

No sleep. Chain smoking. Ignoring injuries. Who was this performance for?

Certainly not her.

"Get well soon. I'm leaving." Her voice was ice.

"Isabella! Wait!"

Desperate, Nathaniel ignored his injuries and lunged after her.

As her hand touched the doorknob, he caged her against the door, his powerful frame trapping her in shadow.

"Have you lost your damn mind?" She seethed.

"Answer one question, and I'll let you go." His voice darkened. "Why did you marry me?"

"Like I need a reason!"

She raised her leg to kick, but Nathaniel pinned her knee against the door, rendering her immobile.

Though skilled, against Nathaniel's military training, she was hopelessly outmatched.

"Just the truth, Isabella."

"Fine! I was out of my damn mind! Now let me go before I scream!"

Nathaniel didn't budge, unsatisfied.

Suddenly the door burst open.

Isabella stumbled backward into Nathaniel's arms. His reflexes were lightning fast - one arm encircled her waist, his palm pressing against her abdomen.

Her curves were more exquisite than he'd imagined.

His throat tightened, heat pooling low.

Isabella's breath hitched as electricity shot through her body.

"Mr. Prescott! Mrs. Prescott?"

Preston stood frozen, his brain short-circuiting at the scene.

Isabella seized the moment to break free, aiming her stiletto at Nathaniel's foot. He dodged effortlessly.

Defeated but victorious, she vanished in a whirl of perfume.

"Should I...go after her?" Preston squeaked.

Nathaniel looked ready to murder someone.

Wrong timing indeed.

"HR. Now. Three months' salary deduction." Nathaniel growled.
###Chapter 115

The marriage between Isabella and Alexander had officially ended after three years.

If her memory served right, Mr. Kingsley's birthday celebration would be next, followed by Alexander's wedding to Arabella.

Arabella had finally gotten what she wanted, flaunting her new status to the world.

Thinking about it, Isabella felt no regret—only relief.

Because only Arabella was worthy of Alexander. Only she could make their love last.

That evening, Isabella returned to Skyridge Manor, accompanied by Sebastian, Nathaniel, and Preston.

"Isabella!"

The moment she stepped through the gates of Silvercrest Harbor, a sweet voice called out to her from a distance.

Isabella's eyes brightened with joy. "Seraphina! How have you been?"

Emeric's youngest daughter, Seraphina, was the first to rush down the long corridor, chirping like a songbird eager to reach her.

"I'm wonderful! I've missed you so much!"

Seraphina threw her arms around Isabella, her lively eyes brimming with tears, her nose turning pink.

"Hey now, no tears! Aren't you happy I'm back?"

Isabella wrapped her arms around Seraphina's waist and pressed a kiss to her smooth forehead.

"You're not leaving again, are you?"

Seraphina's delicate face, like a budding rose, was streaked with worry.

"Not this time. I'm here to help Emeric manage the Sinclair Group, to be with all of you. I won't leave again."

Seeing Seraphina's anxious expression, Isabella felt a pang of guilt.

She had been too reckless in the past, chasing freedom, chasing what she thought was love, neglecting the precious bonds she had at home.

But now, she was back.

Her heart melted every time Seraphina called her name.

"That's—that's wonderful! Everyone's been waiting for you!"

After chatting for a while, Seraphina politely greeted Sebastian and Nathaniel.

"Sebastian. Nathaniel."

"We've told you a thousand times, no need for formalities. Just treat us like you do Isabella."

Nathaniel sighed, affection softening his tone. "You're like a sister to us, just like her."

Seraphina nodded shyly, though she knew she wasn't the same as Isabella.

"You look thinner. Have you been working too hard?" Sebastian asked gently, studying her.

"I've been preparing for my graduation performance, so I'm a little tired. But I love it!"

Seraphina's eyes sparkled, though her voice trembled slightly as she asked, "Will you all come to my performance? It's okay if you're busy—I just thought I'd ask."

Sebastian answered first. "We'll be there."

Nathaniel echoed, "Absolutely."

"Of course we're going! Why even ask?" Isabella slung an arm around Seraphina's shoulders. "Just tell me the date, and I'll clear my schedule for you."

"I'll let you know! Thank you for coming!" Seraphina's voice quivered with excitement.

Isabella gently stroked her hair.

Seraphina was sweet and considerate, never causing trouble for the family. But her kindness only made Isabella feel she deserved more.

As the youngest daughter of the Sinclair family and Eleanor's only child, Seraphina should have been the family's darling. Yet Isabella, as Emeric's eldest, had always overshadowed her.

Still, Seraphina never resented her. Under Eleanor's guidance, she had learned to respect her elders and care for her siblings.

She never took a cent from the family, earning scholarships and working part-time. Her classmates had no idea she came from wealth.

But Isabella knew—Seraphina always felt like an outsider, too humble around everyone.

"Any extra tickets? Can I come too?" Preston suddenly asked.

Seraphina looked up, her cheeks flushing under Preston's warm gaze.

"Yes, there are!"

"Great. Then I'll join everyone." His smile was as bright as sunlight.

He had watched Isabella and Seraphina grow up, remembering how Seraphina used to trail after Isabella, munching on candy at six or seven.

Isabella didn't suspect a thing—Seraphina's shy nature made her blush easily.

But what she didn't know was that Seraphina had been secretly in love with Preston for seven years.

"Let's go. I'm starving. It's been too long since I've had Eleanor's cooking!" Isabella took Seraphina's hand and headed inside.

"Mom's still preparing dinner. You're early—it's not ready yet." Seraphina swung Isabella's arm like she used to as a child.

"Ah? But I'm famished!" Isabella's stomach growled.

"How about a snack first?" Preston pulled a chocolate bar from his pocket.

Isabella turned and took a bite without hesitation.

Watching their easy intimacy, Seraphina pressed her lips together, a sour ache rising in her chest.

She had always known Preston loved Isabella. She'd noticed it as a child.

Preston could have followed his father's footsteps—become a top lawyer or a charismatic prosecutor like Nathaniel. But all he wanted was to stay by Isabella's side, even if it meant being her secretary with no chance of promotion.

To Preston, Isabella was his entire world.

The house buzzed with energy that night, not just because Isabella had finally divorced and cut ties with the Kingsleys, but because Seraphina was home from Elmsworth, bringing life back to the manor.

It had been so long since the staff had seen the sisters together. Their faces glowed with happiness.

Daryl had married into the Helgen family, and with her husband deep in a presidential campaign, she couldn't visit. How perfect it would be if all three sisters could reunite.

Eleanor and the maids brought out dish after dish, the aromas making mouths water.

Isabella was desperate to eat—but she had to wait.

Because Emeric had called everyone into the living room for a meeting.

Sebastian, Nathaniel, Seraphina, Sophia, Vivienne, and Eleanor all gathered as Emeric sat at the center of the couch, his expression stern, every inch the formidable tycoon.

"Can we eat first and talk later? We're starving," Isabella said.

"After the mess you've made, you still have an appetite?" Emeric scoffed.

"I'm divorced. Isn't that worth celebrating?" Isabella laughed.

Seraphina was the only one who didn't know. She gasped in shock.

She never imagined Isabella had been married—let alone divorced!

Isabella was always so smart—she wouldn't marry without reason.

It certainly wasn't for love. Isabella wasn't the type to lose her head over a man.

"You left for three years to marry that man, and now you're cast aside while he moves on to another wedding! How dare they treat you like this? You should ruin them. Bankrupt them!" Emeric's fury was palpable.

"Emeric, I can't do that," Isabella said. "The Kingsley Group was built from nothing by Mr. Kingsley. How could I destroy it? Am I that heartless?"

"I wish you were! I want you to fight back. I'll handle the fallout—I won't let you suffer anymore! Three years of humiliation!" Emeric's voice cracked, his eyes reddening.

The room fell silent.

Sebastian bowed his head, eyes closed. Nathaniel watched Isabella, concern darkening his gaze.

Isabella's lashes trembled, sorrow pooling in her eyes.

She knew how much Emeric loved her. It was that very love—so deep it scared her—that had kept her from telling him about her marriage to Alexander.

But things hadn't gone as she'd hoped.

"Sophia, you saw Isabella at the Kingsleys before. Did you know about her marriage to Alexander?" Emeric's sharp gaze pinned her.

"Yes. I've known for a while." Sophia lowered her eyes, her voice calm.
###Chapter 116

Suri was prepared to shoulder all the blame if it meant protecting Myra and Aviana from exposure.

Emeric jabbed a furious finger at her. "Why didn't you tell me?! She's just a child—she doesn't know any better! And you went along with it?! You watched her grow up! How could you stand by while she suffered in this mess?!"

"I messed up, Emeric." Suri lowered her head. "This is entirely my fault."

She rose slowly, the once-proud heiress of the Bright family now humbled. "Don't blame Evadne. Blame me. I failed her."

Evadne's chest tightened. She opened her mouth to defend Suri, but Aviana suddenly shot up from the couch. "Emeric, don't take it out on Suri! I'm just as responsible! I knew about Evadne's marriage situation ages ago!"

"What?!" Emeric staggered as if struck.

"And me too." Myra hesitantly raised her hand. "I was aware of it as well."

"Myra?! Even you?!" Emeric clutched his chest. "You've been corrupted by them!"

Evadne bit her lip, eyes stinging.

At this point, Emeric's anger was pointless.

"Dad, calm down." Arnold stepped in, handing him a cup of coffee. "They kept it from you for your own good. The less you knew, the better!"

"I don't want to hear another word from you!"

The usually composed Emeric now resembled a warlord on the verge of explosion.

"Wait—you two knew as well?!" He whirled toward Cassius and Arnold.

The brothers exchanged glances, clearing their throats.

This family was full of liars.

He had been played. The only one left in the dark.

Emeric, a titan of the business world who had spent his life outmaneuvering others, had been fooled by his own family.

With a roar, he stormed upstairs.

"Emeric, aren't you staying for dinner?" Myra called after him, but he didn't respond.

"Aviana, you should talk to him. He listens to you," Suri sighed.

"I don't dare." Myra wrung her hands. "I'll make his favorite dishes and send them up later."

Aviana gasped. "When Emeric's upset, he always goes to his treasure room. Oh no—"

A scream echoed from upstairs.

"Call the police! My ten-million-dollar Dante Chair is gone!"

Dinner ended in chaos.

If not for everyone's intervention, Evadne was certain Emeric would have charged straight to Elmsworth to reclaim his precious chair.

The older he got, the more volatile his temper became. The antique world required thick skin, and Emeric had grown increasingly short-fused over the years.

At this rate, no woman would want him—even if he paid them.

That night, Evadne and Nydia chatted happily, sharing a bath, blow-drying each other's hair, and applying skincare before curling up in bed.

"Did you like the birthday gift I gave you?" Nydia propped her chin on her hands.

"I adore it. It's hanging in my Elmsworth study. When Jason saw it, he thought it was a 3D-printed photo of me! He never compliments anyone, but he couldn't stop praising it."

Evadne took Nydia's delicate hands in hers. "Your talent should be declared a world heritage. Or at least insured for millions. You're our family's pride!"

"Sis, stop flattering me. I'm nowhere near Mom's level." Nydia bit her lip, dimples appearing as she blushed.

Evadne's praise thrilled her, but Jason's approval made her heart race. She doubted she'd sleep tonight.

"You inherited Mom's skill and vision. I'll introduce you to a top designer. Collaborate, make waves, and I'll ease you into the fashion industry. What do you think?"

"Thank you, but I want to act. I studied at Elmsworth Film Academy. After graduation, I want to prove myself as an actress." Nydia's voice was soft but determined.

Because Myra had suffered in the industry, Emeric had vehemently opposed Nydia's dreams. She'd dropped out of school in Britain, secretly enrolled in Elmsworth, and only told him after six months. He'd reluctantly agreed but issued an ultimatum: after graduation, she either obeyed the family's plans or was disowned.

To succeed, she had to shine brightly enough to change his mind.

"A dream is worth fighting for. I'll support you all the way." Evadne squeezed her shoulder. "But the industry is ruthless. Without connections, no one will give you a second glance. So when you audition, just write one line on your résumé: 'My father is Emeric.' I guarantee you'll soar."

Nydia laughed weakly. "Dad already hates this path. If I use his name, he'll disown me faster. Besides, shortcuts don't feel rewarding. I want to earn this myself."

"Birds are cherished for their wings, people for their ambitions. You truly are our family's pride." Evadne pinched her cheek gently. "I just worry you'll be taken advantage of."

Nydia was exceptional, but her gentle nature mirrored Myra's. In the cutthroat entertainment world, Evadne feared she'd be devoured.

"Sis, can I ask you something?" Nydia hesitated.

"About my ex-husband?"

Nydia nodded. "Why did you divorce? Was he unkind?"

"He wasn't cruel. We just weren't compatible." Evadne's tone turned icy.

"As Abernathy Group's CEO, he must have been too busy for you. That's why it ended, right?"

Evadne arched a brow. "Why not assume he cheated?"

"Impossible." Nydia waved a hand.

"Why?"

"He's filthy rich. Why risk dying before spending it all?"

Evadne burst out laughing.

Her phone rang. Thaddeus Abernathy's name glared from the screen.

Her expression darkened. Not wanting Nydia to misunderstand, she slipped on her slippers and stepped into the living room.

"What?"

"You answered faster this time." His voice was deep, smooth.

"Remember to leave a five-star review," she deadpanned.

Thaddeus coughed. "I'm being discharged tomorrow. Come to Windermere Estate."

"Discharging so soon? Eager to do something reckless?"

"Just come. I'll be waiting."

"No." Her refusal was instant. "I'm busy, and I won't set foot there again. Don't contact me. Goodbye."

A pause. Then, quietly: "You left belongings here. Don't you want them back?"
###Chapter 117

It seemed Isabella Sinclair was ready to move into Windsor Estates as Mrs. Kingsley and settle down with Alexander.

Of course she wouldn't want his ex-wife's belongings cluttering up their new love nest.

"If Mr. Kingsley finds them in the way, just throw them out. No need to call me for permission," Evelyn's voice was glacial.

"What about the gifts you gave me? Should I toss those too?"

Evelyn's lips curled into a sardonic smile. "Those weren't from me. They were from the old Evelyn. She might have cherished them, but to the current me? Just worthless trash."

Alexander's breath hitched.

"Next time, contact my assistant. I don't take calls from strangers. Goodbye."

"Evelyn."

"What now?" Her patience snapped, voice rising sharply.

"Your clothes. You guarded them like treasures, terrified of even a speck of dust. Don't want them anymore?"

His voice dropped dangerously. "If you don't come collect them personally, I'll consider them abandoned property. And dispose of them accordingly."

Evelyn's chest tightened.

Those exquisite garments—each one was Sophia's private collection. Every stitch bore Sophia's meticulous craftsmanship.

When she'd asked to borrow them to cheer up her grandfather, Sophia had generously let her pick any piece, even insisting she keep them. She couldn't let this man destroy such kindness. Drawing a steadying breath, she said, "I'll send Daniel tomorrow."

"You come yourself."

His tone brooked no argument, smug with newfound leverage. "If your assistant shows up, he won't get past the gates. I'll be expecting you tomorrow. It's settled."

The line went dead.

"Damn him!" Evelyn glared at the darkened screen, fury boiling in her veins.

Just because he had a few of her dresses, he thought he held some power over her!

Fine. She'd go. Consider it slaying dragons.

The next morning found Evelyn and Olivia dressed to perfection, strolling arm-in-arm to breakfast.

Sebastian had left early for an important board meeting. Only Reginald, his three wives, and Nathaniel graced the dining table.

"Sleeping beauties finally grace us with their presence," Nathaniel teased, chin propped on one hand. "We've been waiting ages."

"We stayed up talking half the night," Evelyn yawned, eyes bloodshot.

Olivia, meanwhile, looked fresh as a daisy. College students and their inhuman energy—Evelyn could never.

Reginald sat at the head of the table, dark circles under his eyes. That chair had truly robbed New York's wealthiest man of sleep.

Evelyn, ever resilient, showed no outward effect from last night's drama. Once gifts were given, a lady never took them back.

As breakfast concluded, Evelyn made to leave when Reginald spoke.

"Do you still have feelings for him?"

The table stilled. "No," Evelyn answered calmly.

"Then you're completely over the divorce?"

"Reginald, we've known each other twenty-four years. Spit it out."

"Very well. Lawrence!"

At his summons, the family's chief secretary hurried over with a dossier, which Reginald slid down the table with perfect accuracy.

"What's this?"

"A list."

"Of?"

"Potential suitors." Reginald said it like discussing the weather.

Olivia's fork clattered to the floor. Nathaniel choked on his coffee, coughing violently.

"Reginald!" Evelyn shot to her feet. "Is this payback?"

"Would I retaliate against my own daughter?" His expression remained impassive. "You're divorced. The society pages already whisper. If Alexander can parade his new flame, why shouldn't I arrange worthy matches for you? Whatever he has, you'll have better."

"So if he catches syphilis, I should too?" Evelyn snapped.

"My decision stands. Lawrence compiled this from every eligible bachelor in the country. Starting next month, five meetings per week. Weekends off." His tone left no room for argument.

Evelyn's hands trembled with the urge to flip the table. "I won't go!"

"No dates? Then you don't want the CEO position either?"

"You promised that title if I managed the company well!" She ground her teeth. "Since when do Sinclairs break their word?"

"If my honor buys your lifelong happiness, it's a small price." Reginald's gaze sharpened. "Need I remind you who makes final decisions here?"

Breakfast ended in frosty silence.

Evelyn felt like she'd swallowed kindling, the embers crackling in her lungs.

As a child, she'd hidden in the faux mountain grotto to scribble on rocks or cry. At twenty-four, some habits died hard—she found herself there again, kicking pebbles.

"Knew I'd find you here." Nathaniel ducked into the cave, hands clasped behind his back. "Think Father's punishing you for the chair?"

"Partly. Mostly he's trying to 'reset' me after Alexander's betrayal." Nathaniel folded his long limbs beside her. "By shoving men at me? I'm his daughter, not his clone. Must my worth hinge on some man?"

She skipped a stone across the pond. "If he's so keen, let him find wife number five!"

"You know how he is—vindictive and stubborn." Nathaniel lowered his voice. "No dates, no CEO title. He'll do it."

Evelyn chewed her lip. "What do I do?"

"Give me the list."

"You'll eliminate them?" Her eyes lit up.

"I'll vet them. Pick a decent one to date." His grin widened.

"Are you insane?" She drew back her fist—then her phone rang.

Alexander's name glared from the screen.

Still seething, she answered, ready to unleash. "Calling at dawn? No shame?"

"Are you leaving yet?" He ignored her venom.

"No!"

"Then get moving." A pause. "I'm at your gates."
###Chapter 118

Lucas stood beside his polished black Lamborghini, his tall frame exuding effortless elegance. The morning sunlight caught the sharp angles of his face as he checked the address again.

Silveke Harbor was the estate Alexander had purchased for his late wife, Isabella's mother. The property was legendary among New York's elite, its value beyond measure.

The mansion bore the name of Isabella's mother, Seraphina Lockwood. That's why she'd chosen the alias "Lina" when they first met.

His thoughts were interrupted by the creak of the front gate.

Isabella stood on the stone steps, shielding her eyes against the sun. Today, Lucas wasn't in his usual tailored suit. The light blue linen jacket and khakis made him look almost approachable.

She'd never seen him dressed so casually. The man who usually looked like he'd stepped off a magazine cover now seemed... human.

Pity about his personality.

As she approached, her fluffy bunny slippers peeked out from beneath her silk pajama pants. Lucas's gaze dropped to her feet, his lips twitching.

"See something interesting?" Isabella wiggled her toes defiantly.

"You always wear stilettos. This is... new."

"Your observational skills are pathetic." She crossed her arms. "I walked around like this for three years while we were married. Guess I was invisible back then."

Lucas's jaw tightened. He remembered now - how she'd always greet him at the door, spatula in hand, that soft smile on her face.

He'd taken it for granted. Now the memory burned.

"Get in the car." He opened the passenger door.

"We can talk here."

"Or we could continue this conversation inside your house?" He took a step closer, backing her toward the vehicle.

Before she could protest, his hand closed around her wrist. In one smooth motion, he deposited her in the leather seat and locked the doors.

"Lucas! Unlock this right now!"

"Safety first." The engine roared to life. "And I know you'd bolt given half a chance."

Isabella yanked at the door handle uselessly as Lucas leaned across her. His cologne - something woodsy and expensive - filled her space.

"What the hell are you—"

"Seatbelt." His fingers brushed her waist as he secured the buckle. "Wouldn't want my ex-wife getting hurt."

She recoiled like she'd been burned. "Where are you taking me?"

"You promised to collect your things today. I'm making sure you keep your word."

"I was going to!"

"Forgive me if I don't trust you." The Lamborghini purred onto the highway. "Between our marriage and now, how many lies have you told me, Isabella? Was anything real?"

She laughed, the sound brittle. "If that's what you believe, why bother asking?"

The words hit like a physical blow. Part of him wished she'd never loved him at all - it would make everything simpler.

As Manhattan blurred past, Isabella reclined her seat and closed her eyes. Out of sight, out of mind.

"I'm sorry." His grip on the wheel turned his knuckles white.

"For which part?"

He'd changed since the divorce. The stubborn, prideful man she'd married now apologized with unsettling frequency. Had Vanessa been giving him lessons?

"I didn't know Nathaniel was your brother."

"Water under the bridge." She waved a dismissive hand.

"But why didn't you tell me?"

Her eyes opened, sharp as emeralds. "If I'd said Nathaniel meant nothing to me back then, would you have believed me?"

Lucas swallowed hard.

"Didn't think so." She turned to the window. "This world judges women harshly. If I weren't Nathaniel Lockwood's sister, if I were just Lina, you'd still see me as some gold-digging social climber."

She shrugged. "The opinions of strangers mean nothing to me. Only the people I love matter."

The color drained from Lucas's face. Did that mean... he no longer mattered to her?

The silence stretched until he cleared his throat. "Your brothers are Nathaniel and Adrian. So your other brother... Elijah Lockwood? He took your mother's name?"

Isabella's head snapped around. "Lucas." Her voice could have frozen hell. "You're crossing a line."

"I just—"

"Listen carefully." She leaned forward, every word precise. "I've tolerated your prying because I'm a Lockwood. We're raised to be civilized. But dig into my family again, and I don't care who you are - I'll make you regret it."

Lucas exhaled slowly. "I didn't investigate him. When we met, something felt familiar. Later, I checked my old military academy yearbook and recognized him."

Isabella turned back to the window, effectively dismissing him.

After a moment, Lucas tapped his Bluetooth. "Daniel."

"Yes, Mr. Kingsley?" His assistant answered instantly.

"Have a pair of heels delivered to Windermere Estate. Christian Louboutin, Jimmy Choo, or Manolo Blahnik. Size 36."

Isabella's eyes widened. Those were her favorite brands.

"Right away! Should I send Mrs. Kingsley's usual style?"

Lucas's gaze dropped to her slippers. "Something special."
###Chapter 119

Isabella's lashes trembled slightly as goosebumps prickled across her skin.

"How did you know my shoe size is 36?"

Nathaniel remained expressionless. "They looked small. Just a guess."

Isabella curled her toes uncomfortably in the slippers, her voice icy. "With men, it's always either their hands or their eyes that can't be trusted."

Nathaniel knew he wasn't being honest. He knew her shoe size because he had meticulously gone through every item she left behind at Windsor Estates.

He knew she hoarded snacks like a squirrel, with chocolate taking up most of the space.

Her favorite perfume was Fille de Bel from Maison de Valois. He had smelled it before and thought its spicy, cool scent didn't suit her—until he realized he was wrong. That sharp, proud, intoxicating fragrance was made for her.

He knew she wore size 36 shoes. Those delicate white heels still sat neatly on the shoe rack, as if waiting for her return.

That day, she had accused him of never truly understanding her.

So now, he wanted to try again.

The two-hour car ride passed in near silence.

The Ferrari pulled into Windsor Estates, stopping at the grand entrance.

Nathaniel unbuckled his seatbelt first, then reached for hers.

Anticipating his move, Isabella blocked him with her arm. "I can do it myself."

But before she could react, he had already clicked the release. "No need to thank me."

Her breath hitched. How had he moved so fast? She hadn't even seen his hands move!

Rumors said he could assemble a handgun in eight seconds during his military academy days. His reflexes were terrifying.

Outsmarting her was child's play.

The moment Nathaniel and Isabella stepped inside, whispers erupted among the staff.

"Oh my God! Is that Mr. Nathaniel and Ms. Sinclair? Together?!"

"She's really here! How could he ever divorce someone so stunning?"

"What do we call her now? Mrs. Kingsley or Ms. Sinclair?"

"Better stick with Ms. Sinclair. If Ms. Victoria hears us calling her Mrs. Kingsley, we're dead!"

"True. Ms. Victoria is nothing but a jealous viper compared to Ms. Sinclair."

Nathaniel caught every word. His gaze darkened as he glanced at Isabella beside him.

She must have heard too, but her face remained impassive—unreadable. It unsettled him.

"Where are my things?"

"Still in your room. Exactly where you left them."

"You knew I was coming today. Yet you didn’t prepare in advance. Getting lazy?" She arched a brow.

"Those are your belongings. I didn’t dare touch them." His eyes lingered on her.

Men were masochists, he decided.

When she had been docile, he hadn’t cared. Now, she was a rose with thorns—every word sharp, every glance cutting. And yet, he wanted more.

Isabella avoided his gaze. "So? Do I go up and pack, or will you have someone do it?"

His phone rang.

Nathaniel remembered an urgent conference call. "I need to take this. I'll be back soon."

"Go ahead."

The moment he left, she exhaled, tension draining from her shoulders.

This entire trip was suffocating.

When she was his wife, she had schemed for every second alone with him, only to be met with indifference. Now, he personally drove her, bought her shoes, even buckled her seatbelt—acting like some doting newlywed.

It felt unnatural. Like ants crawling up her spine.

His sudden tenderness was like expired candy—no sweetness, just bitterness.

She dialed Daniel. "Daniel, I'm at Windsor Estates. Can you pick me up?"

"What?! How did you end up there?!"

"Long story. Just get here."

Hanging up, she headed upstairs.

She didn’t want to linger. She’d pack quickly and leave the moment Daniel arrived.

Her old room wasn’t far from Evelyn Kingsley’s. Rumor had it Evelyn had taken leave from school and was home. Isabella decided to check on her.

But as she reached the door, she heard Victoria Kingsley’s shrill voice.

"You little slut! What exactly happened between you and Mr. Adrian at Grandfather’s party? Speak!"

"I didn’t do anything! I swear!" Evelyn’s sobs were heart-wrenching.

"Liar!" Victoria’s rage spiked. "After drinking that, how could nothing happen? Then explain the hickey on his neck!"

"I don’t know! I can’t remember—Ah!"

Crash!

A vase shattered.

Isabella’s fists clenched. Without hesitation, she kicked the door open.

Victoria barely had time to turn before something smacked her square in the face—a slipper.

"Ah!" A second later, the other slipper followed.

Victoria staggered, her nose reddening, a perfect shoe print stamped on her forehead. She looked ridiculous.

Clutching her face, she pointed at Isabella, too furious to form words.

"Calling others sluts so freely—did you forget to wash your mouth after using the toilet?" Isabella crossed her arms, tilting her head with a chilling smile.

"Sister-in-law!" Evelyn huddled in the corner, trembling.

Tears spilled down her cheeks at the sight of Isabella.

"Isabella! You lunatic!" Victoria seethed, her face throbbing. The slippers had left her skin stinging worse than a slap. "Don’t think you can bully me just because you’re a Sinclair! I’m a Kingsley—I won’t let this slide!"

"Promises, promises. Or else I’d have no reason to hit you again."

Isabella’s eyes glittered with icy mockery. "All you do is torment your own sister. How impressive."

Victoria’s face twisted. It took her a full three seconds to process the insult before she lunged. "You dare mock me?! I’ll ruin you!"

Isabella sighed, disgusted.

She had no desire to dirty her hands. Some people weren’t worth the effort. Touching them risked infection.

Just as Victoria’s nails grazed toward her, a strong hand caught her wrist.

"Ah—!" Victoria bent double in pain.

Isabella felt a familiar presence behind her. She turned, startled.

Nathaniel’s piercing gaze met hers.

For a fleeting second, she thought she saw concern in those depths.

She must be imagining things.

Trust a ghost before trusting a man.

"Did she hurt you?" His voice was low, laced with something unfamiliar—worry.
###Chapter 120

Isabella blinked, then responded coolly. "I'm fine, but Amelia might not be."

Nathaniel's dark eyes deepened. His grip tightened around Vanessa's wrist.

"Ow! Let go! You're hurting me!" Vanessa cried out, tears welling in her eyes as sweat beaded on her forehead.

Nathaniel pressed his lips together, then spoke without hesitation. "Let her go."

With a forceful shove, Vanessa stumbled backward, landing on the floor in humiliation.

"She threw her shoe at me first! Look at the mark on my face—proof!" Vanessa sobbed, pounding the floor with her fist. "She barged into our home and attacked your sister! How can you be so biased?"

Nathaniel didn’t even glance at her. His focus remained on Isabella. "Are you really okay?"

Isabella, visibly irritated, ignored him. She moved swiftly to Amelia’s side, crouching down to stroke her soft hair gently.

Amelia flung herself into Isabella’s arms, sobbing.

She hadn’t cried when Vanessa hit her, but seeing Isabella broke her.

"Don’t cry. I’m here now. No one will ever hurt you again." Isabella held her close, glaring at Vanessa with fury.

What a vile woman—just like the wicked stepmother from fairy tales.

Watching them, Nathaniel felt an unfamiliar warmth stir in his usually cold heart.

"Vanessa," Isabella said icily, "listen carefully. From now on, I’m Amelia’s protector. Don’t think I’m unaware of what happens in this house just because I’m not here. I don’t care about anything else, but if you lay a finger on her again, don’t blame me for what happens next. The Sinclair family won’t let the Kingsleys off easily."

Vanessa’s pupils shrank. A chill ran down her spine. She looked desperately at Nathaniel, her makeup smeared.

"Did you hear her?" Nathaniel asked coldly, his gaze never leaving Isabella.

Vanessa’s hope shattered. He wouldn’t defend her. He never truly saw her as family.

She had no choice but to swallow her pride.

"Apologize to Amelia. Now," Nathaniel ordered sternly.

Vanessa bit her lip, refusing to speak.

"Vanessa!"

"Forget it. A forced apology means nothing," Isabella said firmly. "Just stay out of her way from now on."

Rubbing the shoe print on her forehead, Vanessa stormed off to her room.

"Isabella! You crazy witch! You’ll pay for this!"

Her eyes burned with rage. It took her a moment to realize—why was Isabella here? Did Nathaniel bring her? What was he planning?

Was he trying to reconcile with his ex-wife? Unacceptable!

Victoria was nasty, but she came from nothing and looked worn out. Vanessa could handle her.

But Isabella was different. She came from power and was ruthless. If she and Nathaniel reunited, Vanessa would be crushed under the Sinclair family’s wrath.

An idea struck her.

"Maybe I should summon Victoria and let them destroy each other," she thought.

Decision made, she dialed Victoria’s number.

"Victoria, we have a problem! Nathaniel brought Isabella home, and they’re acting all cozy. Your place in his heart is in danger!"

Meanwhile, Nathaniel ordered the staff to clean Amelia’s room while Isabella comforted her.

"Don’t be scared. I’m here."

Though Amelia was twenty, her autism made her cling to Isabella like a child. "Sis-in-law, don’t leave. Stay with me. I missed you."

The term "sis-in-law" made Isabella stiffen uncomfortably.

Nathaniel watched their closeness silently, stepping closer.

"Mr. Kingsley," Isabella said coldly, "I know you’re busy and hate this house. But you watched Amelia grow up. She respects you. If you have any decency, don’t ignore Vanessa’s cruelty again. If I find out she hurt Amelia, I’ll sue her for assault."

Nathaniel’s lips pressed into a thin line.

He was rarely home. He hadn’t realized Vanessa’s cruelty toward his sister. Her sweet act in front of their grandfather was a lie.

"I promise. It won’t happen again."

"Your promise means nothing to me. I’m not the one suffering."

Isabella’s sharp words didn’t faze him anymore. He was used to her coldness.

After comforting Amelia, Isabella followed Nathaniel to the room she’d lived in alone for three years.

She strode confidently to the wardrobe, opening it to see her belongings neatly arranged.

Memories flooded her—nights spent crafting gifts for him, hoping to see him smile. Only for him to barely glance at them.

She stood with her back to him, pain twisting her heart, a mocking smile on her lips.

Once, she’d loved him desperately.

Now, there was only emptiness.

"Do you have a suitcase? I didn’t bring one. I need to pack my things."

Before she could finish, a shadow loomed over her.

Startled, she looked up to find his hand slamming the wardrobe shut, trapping her beneath him.

The dim light glinted off his cufflinks, making her shiver.

"Nathaniel, what are you doing?"

His voice was low, rough. "Isabella."

It sent chills down her spine.

"If you want to leave, tell me one thing first—why did you marry me?"
###Chapter 121

"Are we really going to keep doing this forever?"

Isabella's fingers tightened around the car door handle. She inhaled sharply, her eyes burning with fury. "I've said everything I needed to say. If you still refuse to believe me, then there's nothing left to discuss!"

"Did we meet before? A long time ago?"

Nathaniel's voice was desperate, his body unconsciously leaning closer, nearly pressing against her slender back. "Isabella, tell me the truth. Did we know each other before?"

Her heart clenched, lips paling. "You're imagining things. The first time we met was the day your grandfather arranged our marriage. There was nothing before that."

She couldn't let him find out.

She couldn't let him know she was the girl who saved him all those years ago.

Their marriage was over. What good would it do to dredge up thirteen years of unrequited love? To expose how pathetically she'd chased after him?

Isabella Sinclair had her pride. She refused to let him see how deeply she'd once loved him.

How humiliating.

Nathaniel's expression darkened, disappointment flickering in his gaze. Something didn't add up.

"Let go. I need to get my things and leave." Her voice shook as she forced the car door open.

"Isabella."

"Stop asking! Just stop!"

Her voice cracked like a whip, sharp and brittle. "We're divorced, Nathaniel. Do you understand what that means? Why are you digging into the past? What does it matter if I was in love with you once? I don't love you anymore. Every time I see these things I gave you, every time I see you, I feel sick!"

In love.

The words echoed in his mind, drowning out everything else.

He froze, then abruptly turned her around, gripping her shoulders.

Her eyes were red.

"You can cry if you need to," he murmured, voice rough but softer than before.

"Cry?" She let out a bitter laugh. "Can't you see I'm furious? Divorcing you was the best decision I ever made. I laugh about it in my sleep. Why would I cry?"

Her gaze was icy, chest rising with each furious breath. "The moment I signed those papers, I swore I'd never shed another tear for you. Never again."

The words cut deeper than she intended.

Before he could respond, a knock interrupted them.

"Mr. Nathaniel, are you in there?"

The butler's voice was polite. "Ms. Victoria is here. She's waiting for you downstairs, sir."

Isabella's vision darkened, storm clouds gathering.

Nathaniel's expression turned thunderous.

Downstairs, Victoria paced anxiously.

Servants whispered in the shadows, eyes darting between her and the staircase.

Everyone knew his ex-wife was here. If the two women crossed paths, it would be explosive.

"Nathaniel!" Victoria spotted him descending the stairs and flung herself into his arms, clinging desperately.

He stiffened, hands hovering over her shoulders—ready to push her away, but she held on like a drowning woman clutching driftwood.

"I missed you so much," she sobbed into his chest. "I was wrong, I know I was! I just—I lost control. You know me, Nathaniel. We grew up together!"

She was following Elspeth's advice—play the heartbroken lover, let tears soften him.

But when she heard Isabella was back in his life, she couldn't wait any longer.

"Victoria." His voice lacked its usual warmth. "I told you it's better if we don't see each other right now. Go home."

"Why?" Her tears fell like rain, perfectly timed.

"Yeah, why?"

A cool voice cut through the tension.

Everyone looked up.

Isabella descended the stairs, suitcase in hand, chin lifted. Elegant. Composed.

A stark contrast to Victoria's tear-streaked face.

Victoria tightened her grip on Nathaniel, shooting Isabella a venomous glare.

The air crackled with tension.

Nathaniel's hands flexed on Victoria's shoulders—ready to shove her away.

But to Isabella, it looked like an embrace.

She just wanted to go home. To scrub away every trace of him. Anything he'd touched felt tainted.

"Ms. Victoria is your fiancée," Isabella said sweetly. "She came all this way to see you. How could you turn her away? How heartless." She smirked. "Don't worry, I'm just collecting my things. I'll be out of your way soon. Carry on—time is precious, after all."

Nathaniel's jaw clenched, face paling then flushing with anger.

Victoria, still sniffling, didn't dare provoke Isabella again—not after the humiliation at the birthday party.

"Oh, and one more thing." Isabella adjusted her grip on the suitcase. "I'm leaving behind everything I ever gave you. Especially the gifts. When you move in, do me a favor and throw them out. Keeping an ex's belongings is bad luck—terrible for new relationships."

With that, she strode past them.

Victoria and the servants stood frozen.

Isabella felt no jealousy. Only triumph.

As she stepped outside, Nathaniel finally snapped. He shoved Victoria away—hard.

She crashed into a side table, shattering porcelain, dress torn, wrist bleeding.

Upstairs, Glynnis watched, seething.

Isabella walked briskly down the driveway, slippers slapping against the pavement.

"Isabella! Wait!" Nathaniel called after her, desperation raw in his voice.

She didn't slow down.

"Mr. Nathaniel! I have Mrs. Kingsley's shoes!"

Gordon rushed forward, sweating, holding a luxury shopping bag.

Nathaniel snatched it and blocked Isabella's path.

"Here." He thrust the bag at her.

She glanced down, took it without a word, and kept walking.

For a fleeting moment, satisfaction warmed his chest—she'd accepted something from him.

Then—

Crash.

The shoes hit the trash can with a hollow thud.

Gordon gasped.

Nathaniel stood stunned, watching as Isabella walked away without a backward glance.

His expression—shattered.

Like a man who'd just lost everything.
###Chapter 122

Nathaniel paced outside the Windsor Estates, his anxiety palpable.

When he spotted Isabella stepping out with a suitcase, he rushed to assist her.

"Isabella, did Alexander give you any trouble?"

"If he dared, I'd have made sure he regretted it," Isabella retorted sharply.

Nathaniel noticed her bare feet and frowned. "Your shoes?"

"I left in a hurry and forgot to change."

Truthfully, there were several pairs of her designer heels by the entrance—she could've easily slipped into any of them before leaving.

But she refused.

She refused to give in to Alexander or the past three years.

Those shoes belonged to Evelyn, neatly arranged as if waiting for anyone to claim them.

Isabella's footwear was exclusively high-end stilettos. She wouldn't be caught dead wearing Evelyn's old shoes, nor would she ever reminisce about that time.

"Take me to The Regal Palace."

The Bugatti's engine roared to life, and Isabella was gone.

Upstairs in the estate, Alexander stood by the window, his gaze fixed on the direction she'd left, his chest tight with regret.

Back at the hotel, Isabella remained silent as she and Nathaniel rode the elevator to the executive offices.

The moment they stepped into the hallway, they were startled by Dominic's sudden appearance.

"Dominic? What are you doing here?" Isabella approached him, eyebrows raised.

"I took the stairs," Dominic replied with a smirk.

His forehead glistened with sweat, his muscular arms holding his suit jacket. His shirt was unbuttoned just enough to reveal his collarbone and a hint of his toned chest.

Nathaniel scowled internally. Who does this playboy think he is? Flexing his muscles like that'll impress her?

Dominic, as if reading his mind, deliberately loosened another button and shot Nathaniel a smug grin.

"How did security let you up without an appointment or my approval?" Isabella snapped.

Dominic blinked, taken aback. He'd meant to surprise her, but it seemed he'd only managed to irritate her.

"I'll handle it," Nathaniel said coldly, glaring at Dominic.

"No need. I snuck in."

Dominic quickly switched to a charming smile, gripping Isabella's arm. "They wouldn't let me see you. I had no choice. Don't blame them—blame me!"

"Deduct the executive secretary's salary for this month. Find out who was on security duty today, pay them off, and fire them."

Isabella issued the command without hesitation, yanking her arm free before striding toward her office.

"Yes, ma'am." Nathaniel smirked as Dominic was left standing there, looking like a scolded puppy.

"Isabella!" Dominic scrambled after her, desperate. "I messed up. I'll make it right. Just tell me what you want—anything!"

"Dominic." She turned, her gaze icy. "Come inside. We need to talk."

Dominic's eyes lit up, thinking he'd been granted a reprieve, and eagerly followed her into the office.

Nathaniel was left outside, relegated to guard duty.

The moment the door closed, Isabella took a seat on the sofa, crossing her long legs. One hand rested on the armrest, the other draped casually over her knee. Every inch of her exuded the commanding presence of the Sinclair heiress.

Dominic swallowed hard, utterly captivated.

He loved this version of her—powerful, untouchable.

"I knew you wouldn't summon me for nothing," he purred, moving closer.

But her voice cut through the air like a blade.

"Dominic, did you think I was joking with you before?"

He froze.

"Evelyn might've tolerated your antics because you helped her once. But I, Isabella Sinclair, don't have that kind of patience."

Her stare was frigid, as if they'd never met.

He took another step forward, but her sharp glare stopped him in his tracks.

"Even though you're the Sinclair heiress now, you were still Evelyn once! Just because you changed your name doesn't erase everything!"

"The moment Alexander and I signed those divorce papers, Evelyn ceased to exist." Her lips curled into a cold smile. "Neither you nor Alexander have any place in my life now. Mr. Vanderbilt, you're engaged. Act like it. Don't throw away an entire garden for one flower—especially when that flower was never yours to begin with."

"Tell me what I did wrong. I'll fix it!" His voice cracked with desperation.

16:50

"And one more thing." Her tone turned glacial. "I know what you did to Seraphina at Mr. Lockwood's birthday party."

Dominic paled, his pulse skyrocketing as the memory flashed through his mind.

The secluded woods. His hands gripping her bare shoulders, her white dress slipping. The way her lips had felt against his—

If only she weren't Alexander's sister. If only his heart hadn't already belonged to someone else.

He never had much self-control. And when she offered herself, how could he resist?

"Your reckless behavior is your own business. But Seraphina is my sister—innocent, naive. I won't let anyone hurt her."

"No, Isabella, you've got it all wrong!" Dominic's shirt clung to him, drenched in sweat. "That night, something happened to her. I was just—just—"

"Just playing the hero?"

He clenched his jaw, realizing how flimsy it sounded.

"You should've reported it to the Lockwoods immediately. Who gave you the right to intervene?"

Her laugh was mocking. "Mr. Vanderbilt, can't even own up to your mistakes?"

"I was framed! She kissed me first! I didn't do anything!" His voice was raw with frustration.

Isabella waved a dismissive hand. "Dominic, Seraphina isn't part of your world. She's fragile. You have plenty of women—don't drag her into your mess."

Dominic felt the fight drain out of him. No matter what he said, she'd already labeled him a villain.

And maybe he was. But he hated that she saw him that way.

"I have work to do. Leave. And if you show up unannounced again, security will escort you out. Nathaniel, see him out."

"Isabella!" He lunged forward, desperate for one last chance.

A sharp click echoed through the room.

The cold edge of a butterfly knife pressed against his throat.
###Chapter 123

Jareth's face drained of all color in an instant.

He never even saw Evadne's hand move. By the time he registered the motion, the cold steel of a butterfly knife was already pressed against his throat.

The weapon was sleek, deadly—infamous for its swift, lethal precision. A single flick of the wrist could end a life before the victim even realized they'd been struck.

And here was Evadne, wielding it with effortless ease, her expression chillingly indifferent.

"Back off, Jareth." Her voice was low, dangerous. The blade glinted as she tapped it lightly against his cheek. "Even if you were the last man on earth, I still wouldn’t choose you."

His heart hammered violently. "What if it was just me and Thaddeus left?"

A cold laugh escaped her lips. "Still not you."

Jareth's pride shattered like glass.

At that moment, the office door swung open.

"Evadne?" Cassius stood in the doorway, brows raised in surprise.

In a blink, the knife vanished. Her demeanor shifted instantly, a bright smile replacing the icy threat. "Brother! You should've told me you were coming."

Jareth stiffened, his eyes burning with humiliation. Without a word, he turned and stalked out, shoulders rigid with defeat.

Cassius watched him go, bemused. Only Evadne could reduce the arrogant heir of the Jareth Group to this.

"Bro!" She threw her arms around Cassius, hugging him tight. "How's your injury?"

"Long healed." He chuckled, lifting her off her feet in a playful spin. "I'm not that fragile."

Few knew Cassius's past—how a man so refined had once commanded the most feared syndicate in Windhelm. Even Evadne couldn't reconcile his gentle nature with the ruthless power he'd wielded.

"So, what was that about?" Cassius nodded toward the door.

Evadne sighed, rubbing her temples. "I had to make it clear. He wouldn't take no for an answer."

"You could've been gentler."

"And let him keep chasing me forever?" She shook her head. "Better to end it now."

Cassius sighed. "Sometimes I wish you were more like Naomi."

"Too late for that." She smirked. "I already dealt with her."

Leaning against him, she closed her eyes as he massaged her temples.

"Got something for me?" she murmured.

"Sharp as ever." He handed her a folder. "The Abernathy Group secured the Westguard project. Thaddeus handed it to Elspeth."

Evadne's eyes gleamed as she scanned the documents. "She thinks she can take over the Abernathy empire? Delusional."

"Meeting's at Wye Golf Course the day after tomorrow. Your move."

She grinned. "You know me. I don’t do half-measures."

Cassius pinched her cheek lightly. "Leave me some dignity, will you?"

"I'm not a kid anymore." Her expression turned serious. "You’ve done enough for me. It’s my turn to protect you."

Meanwhile, Acacia stormed into her penthouse, furious after Thaddeus's cold dismissal.

Elspeth's scolding only made it worse. "You’re pathetic! Crying won’t get you anywhere!"

"But Evadne—"

"Enough!" Elspeth snapped. "Focus on the goal. Become Mrs. Abernathy. Everything else is secondary."

The call ended abruptly.

Acacia seethed, gripping her phone until her knuckles turned white.

Then, an unknown number flashed on the screen.

"Who is this?" she hissed.

A familiar, mocking voice answered. "Ahley. Miss me?"

Her blood ran cold.

Ahley—her old identity, buried the moment she returned to Thaddeus.

Yet here he was, dragging her past back to haunt her.

"Where are you?" she whispered, fear clawing at her throat. "I’ll come to you."
###Chapter 124

The bar pulsed with life despite the late hour.

Isabella Sinclair sat alone in a dimly corner, her simple sportswear a stark contrast to the women around her—bare-backed, glittering, faces painted with heavy makeup. She'd been waiting too long when the stench of alcohol hit her.

She glanced up.

Nathan Prescott slid onto the stool beside her, his cologne thick enough to choke on.

"Isabella," he drawled, lips curling into a smirk. "Still gorgeous. Still irresistible." His gaze raked over her, shameless, lingering.

She recoiled, skin crawling.

Once, she'd craved his sweet lies, his sculpted body, the way he'd made her feel in bed.

Now? Just the sight of him made her stomach turn. How had she ever wanted this man?

He wasn't fit to lick Alexander Kingsley's shoes.

"When did you get back?" she hissed, voice low. "Why are you here?"

"To see you." He leaned in, breath hot against her ear. "With you, I feel... home."

His hand slid up her thigh, fingers digging in. When she didn't stop him, he grew bolder, tugging at her waistband. "Next time, wear a skirt. This is annoying."

Isabella grabbed his wrist, nails biting in. "What do you want?"

"You," he purred. Then laughed. "And money."

"I paid you off when we ended things!" Her voice cracked with fury.

"Gambling's a bitch. That cash didn't last." His grin turned vicious. "But you? Engaged to the CEO of Imperial Entertainment? Saw it in the papers. Bet your perfect wedding budget could spare some change."

The threat hung between them.

Isabella's pulse roared. "Tell Alexander whatever you want. He loves me. He won't care about my past. Everyone has exes."

"True." Nathan sipped her drink, smug. "But how many exes knocked you up before marriage? How many left you with a kid you dumped?"

Ice flooded her veins.

That baby girl—gone before she'd held her. "You bastard," she whispered. "I couldn't abort. The risk—"

"You begged me not to pull out." He smirked, draping an arm over her shaking shoulders. "That kid tied us together. Now? She's my ticket back into your life."

"How much?" Her voice was dead.

"Fifty grand."

"My family's broke."

"Then ask Kingsley." Nathan's eyes gleamed. "Rich bastard like him? Pocket change. He spoils you. He'll pay."

Isabella's fists clenched. Then—calm. A plan formed.

She leaned into him, lips brushing his ear. "Alexander's leaving me."

Nathan jerked back. "What?"

"He found someone else." A tear slid down her cheek. "I'm losing him. I can't give you money—I might not even have a home soon."

Panic flashed in his eyes. No Kingsley money meant no payout. No payout meant no ticket back to his cushy life abroad.

"No way to fix it?" he demanded.

"Maybe if she... disappeared." Isabella's gaze dropped, lashes hiding the venom in her eyes.

Nathan made a slashing motion across his throat.

"Help me," she whispered, fingers tracing his jaw. "Make sure Alexander marries me. Then?" She smiled, slow, sweet. "Fifty grand? Try half a million."

His breath hitched. Greed lit his face as he shoved her against the wall, hand fumbling with her zipper. "Who is she?"

Next day. Imperial Entertainment HQ.

Alexander Kingsley stood at the floor-to-ceiling windows, cold coffee forgotten in his hand. The skyline of New York sprawled before him, glittering, indifferent.

16:50.

Gordon stormed in, crumpling a sheet of paper. "This is bullshit! Since when does an actress with zero leadership skills get named Vice Chair? Elspeth's a glorified gold-digger! If she qualifies, my dog could run this company!"

"Frederic gave her the Westguard deal to grease the wheels," Alexander said tonelessly. The coffee tasted like ash.

"After everything you've done—" Gordon's face darkened. "Your brother can't even walk without help! How's he fit to lead? And your father? Backing Elspeth just to spite you? What kind of man sabotages his own son?"

"Enough." Alexander pinched the bridge of his nose. "We don't discuss this outside this room."

"What's the play, sir?"

Alexander's jaw tightened. "I wanted to wait. But if Frederic forces my hand?" He exhaled. "War it is."

His phone buzzed. Jareth. Again.

He almost ignored it—until the caller ID flashed: Evadne Prescott.

He answered.

Jareth's voice was ragged. "She dumped me. For real. Knife to my throat, man. It's over."

Alexander's lips curved. "Good."
###Chapter 125

The sun blazed overhead as Nathaniel Prescott extended an invitation to Mr. Bartholomew and his wife to the prestigious Wye Golf Club, hoping to secure their support for the Westguard development.

The exclusive club was nearly deserted today, save for the Prescott family and the Bartholomews' entourage.

Isabella Sinclair had never been skilled at golf, but she dressed the part impeccably. Clad in pristine white golf attire with minimal makeup, she stood beside her daughter, Evelyn, looking more like sisters than mother and daughter.

Bringing Evelyn here had been strategic—Isabella wanted her to make an impression on the Bartholomews.

At twenty-five, Evelyn was at the perfect age for marriage. Isabella wasn’t about to let her daughter’s infatuation with one man limit her prospects.

"Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Bartholomew," Evelyn greeted with practiced grace, dipping into a polite curtsy.

"Oh, Miss Evelyn! You're even lovelier in person than on television," Mrs. Bartholomew remarked with a warm smile.

The compliment made both Isabella and Evelyn stiffen slightly.

Was this a veiled reference to Evelyn’s public apology scandal?

Though the incident had faded from headlines, the internet still circulated unflattering memes of her humiliation.

Mr. Bartholomew cleared his throat, subtly nudging his wife.

Realizing her misstep, Mrs. Bartholomew quickly amended, "What I meant was, your daughter is truly the most beautiful among Elmsworth’s elite young ladies."

"Thank you, Mrs. Bartholomew," Isabella replied smoothly, steering Evelyn forward. "Why didn’t your son join us today? I heard he and Evelyn attended the same university."

"Ah, he had prior commitments," Mrs. Bartholomew said dismissively.

"What a shame. We must arrange another meeting soon," Isabella pressed.

"Perhaps another time," Mrs. Bartholomew replied vaguely before shifting the subject. "By the way, don’t you have another daughter? Why isn’t she here?"

Evelyn’s smile faltered.

The implication was clear—Mrs. Bartholomew wasn’t interested in her.

Isabella’s grip on Evelyn’s arm tightened. "My younger daughter is rather frail. She prefers staying home."

"Oh? Poor thing," Mrs. Bartholomew murmured, her tone laced with disinterest.

Isabella bristled.

Were her daughters mere commodities to be picked at will?

Meanwhile, Nathaniel and Alexander Kingsley had finished several rounds with Mr. Bartholomew, strolling leisurely across the manicured greens.

"Mr. Bartholomew, the Prescott Group owes this opportunity to your generosity," Nathaniel said, shaking his hand firmly.

"Nonsense! We’ve been friends for years. Of course, I’d think of you first," Mr. Bartholomew chuckled.

"Then let’s celebrate tonight!"

"Ah, tonight is my father-in-law’s birthday. I can’t miss it," Mr. Bartholomew declined. "But after we sign the contract on Friday, we’ll drink properly!"

Alexander listened in silence, his expression unreadable, though tension coiled inside him.

He had to act before Friday.

Once the contract was signed, it would be too late.

Just then, a golf cart rolled to a stop nearby.

"Good afternoon, Mr. Bartholomew, Mr. Prescott."

The voice was crisp, melodic—like wind chimes on a summer breeze.

Alexander’s head snapped up.

There, seated in the cart, was Seraphina Lockwood.

His pulse spiked.

Even after yesterday’s humiliation, the sight of her sent heat rushing through his veins.

Evelyn gasped. "How did you get in here?!"

"Through the front gate," Seraphina replied coolly, barely sparing her a glance.

Evelyn’s face burned with remembered shame.

Isabella paled.

But Mrs. Bartholomew’s eyes lit up.

Who was this stunning young woman? She was exactly the kind of daughter-in-law she envisioned!

Daniel Carter stepped out first, offering Seraphina his hand as she descended.

Dressed in a sky-blue golf ensemble with a wide-brimmed white hat, Seraphina looked effortlessly radiant. The breeze teased the hem of her skirt, revealing toned legs that drew more than a few appreciative glances.

Alexander’s jaw tightened when he noticed their matching shirts.

The coincidence felt deliberate.

"Ms. Lockwood, what a surprise," Nathaniel greeted, though his smile didn’t reach his eyes.

"No surprise, Mr. Prescott," Seraphina said, her gaze sharp. "I came specifically to speak with Mr. Bartholomew."

Nathaniel’s smile vanished.

Alexander’s instincts screamed warning.

Seraphina never appeared without reason.

"Mr. Bartholomew," she began, her voice steady, "I understand you’re overseeing the Westguard project in Elmsworth and seeking a development partner."

She met his gaze squarely. "I’d like to propose a collaboration."

Nathaniel and Isabella froze.

Mr. Bartholomew blinked, glancing between Nathaniel and Alexander.

Alexander’s throat burned as he stared at Seraphina, but she refused to acknowledge him.

"Miss, you are...?" Mr. Bartholomew asked, perplexed.

Seraphina extended her hand. "Seraphina Lockwood."

At first, the name meant nothing to him.

Then she added with a faint smile, "Sebastian Lockwood is my father."
###Chapter 126

Mr. Bartley and his wife froze like statues when they heard the revelation.

The K Group of Skyrim? Emeric’s daughter?

"Are you truly the chairman’s daughter?" Mr. Bartley stammered, his voice laced with disbelief.

"Indeed. You can verify with these two gentlemen."

Evadne gestured toward Thaddeus and Frederic, her lips curving into a confident smile. "I’ve had some prior dealings with the Abernathy family. They can confirm my identity."

Thaddeus’s gaze darkened.

She hesitated to call them "acquaintances"—because she certainly didn’t consider them friends.

"Gentlemen, it seems Ms. Evadne is familiar with you."

The moment Mr. Bartley, the government official, learned she was Emeric’s daughter, his demeanor shifted instantly. "I had no idea of your background. My apologies."

He extended his hand, shaking hers firmly.

"Mr. Bartley," Evadne said smoothly, her eyes gleaming with quiet assurance. "Now that we’ve established my credentials, may we discuss a potential collaboration?"

Mr. Bartley faltered slightly.

There was something about this young woman—an unshakable presence that demanded attention.

Thaddeus clenched his fists, irritation flaring.

Now that she had the Ashbourne name behind her, did she think she could waltz in and dictate terms?

Did she believe business was some casual game she could join whenever she pleased?

"Ms. Evadne," Frederic interjected, his smile polite but his eyes icy. "A pleasure to meet you, but Mr. Bartley and I have pressing matters to discuss. This isn’t something you can simply interrupt. Would you kindly excuse yourself?"

Glynnis seethed, but Elspeth held her back.

Frederic would handle Evadne. There was no need for Glynnis to intervene.

"I understand you have important discussions," Evadne replied calmly, "but if not for Westguard, I wouldn’t be here. I don’t see why I can’t participate. The Ashbourne Group is just as capable as the Abernathy Group—in resources, funding, and execution. Shopping around for the best option is standard practice. I’m merely offering Mr. Bartley an alternative. What’s wrong with that?"

Mr. Bartley blinked. She wasn’t playing around.

Frederic and Elspeth’s expressions darkened.

"Ms. Evadne." Thaddeus finally stepped forward, his towering frame casting a shadow over her. His voice was low, edged with warning. "The Abernathy Group has already reached a preliminary agreement with Mr. Bartley. Every detail has been finalized to meet Westguard’s development requirements. You barging in now, attempting to derail our deal—do you truly find that ethical?"

Evadne tilted her head up, her striking features illuminated by a faint, knowing smile. "Derail? You’re right. I am here to disrupt your deal."

"Evadne!" Thaddeus’s jaw tightened, his eyes flashing.

"But you’re mistaken about ethics," she continued, stepping back to escape his oppressive aura. "In business, ethics are defined by the victors. Had the Abernathy Group already signed the contract, then yes, I’d be crossing a line. But as it stands, no agreement has been finalized. The game is still open."

Thaddeus narrowed his eyes, frustration simmering.

She was right. Until ink met paper, anything could happen. He’d lived by that rule for years, crushing countless competitors.

Now, the tables had turned—and his opponent was his ex-wife.

"Ms. Evadne," Elspeth sneered, her patience wearing thin, "I doubt Mr. Bartley will choose to work with you. The Abernathy Group and he have years of trust and collaboration behind them. That’s something a newcomer like you can’t compete with. Crashing our meeting uninvited? That’s not just rude—it’s unprofessional."

"Exactly!" Glynnis muttered under her breath.

Evadne sighed theatrically. "I admit, my arrival was abrupt. But I had no choice. I feared if I delayed, Mr. Bartley might regret his decision."

"Regret? What are you implying?" Elspeth snapped.

Ignoring her, Evadne turned to Mr. Bartley. "Are you truly unwilling to consider the Ashbourne Group? Or is it because I’m a woman with no apparent influence? Let me assure you—I’m here with the full authority of my brother, Cassius, president of the K Group. If you doubt me, I can arrange a meeting with him immediately."

"Ms. Evadne, it’s not a matter of trust," Mr. Bartley said diplomatically. "The Abernathy Group and I have a long-standing partnership. This project is in Elmsworth—their stronghold. Perhaps another time?"

Frederic and Elspeth exchanged smug glances.

Did this woman really think she could swoop in and steal their deal?

"Very well. I understand loyalty to old partners." Evadne’s smile turned enigmatic. "But if you choose the Ashbourne Group, I can promise you one thing—you won’t regret it."

A chill ran down Thaddeus’s spine.

That look in her eyes—she was planning something.

"Ms. Evadne," Elspeth demanded sharply, "what exactly are you suggesting? Is there some issue with working with the Abernathy Group?"

"Mr. Jason," Evadne said suddenly, "what time is it?"

"Three in the afternoon, ma’am."

"Perfect. Pull up the latest broadcast from World Wonders Weekly and show Mr. Bartley."

Jason obeyed, tapping on his phone before turning the screen toward the group.

The reporter’s voice rang out clearly:

"Breaking news—Earl Frost, deputy general manager of the Abernathy Group, was arrested this afternoon on charges of bribery. He stands accused of manipulating bids for IT equipment and irregularities in project contracts, securing illicit gains. Sources confirm Earl is the cousin of Elspeth Abernathy, wife of the chairman, and they have jointly overseen multiple ventures. The extent of her involvement remains under investigation. Stay tuned for updates."

Frederic’s face drained of color. Elspeth swayed, her vision blurring.

"What the hell?!" Glynnis shrieked. "How could Uncle Earl be arrested?!"

Thaddeus’s gaze locked onto Evadne’s composed expression, his brow twitching.

Elspeth’s cousin had been detained two hours ago—yet the news had been suppressed until now.

No doubt, her brother Arnold Ashbourne, the prosecutor, had orchestrated this.

"Elspeth!" Frederic hissed, panic creeping into his voice. "What is this?"

"I don’t know! There must be some mistake!" Elspeth’s denial was desperate. "This is all lies!"

But Mr. and Mrs. Bartley’s faces had turned grim.

"Elspeth," Mrs. Bartley said coldly, "Earl is your cousin. And you were involved in those projects, weren’t you?"

"I had no idea!" Elspeth protested weakly.

Just then, commotion erupted across the golf course.

A group of stern-faced men in suits approached swiftly—badges glinting on their chests.

The prosecution.

"Ms. Elspeth," the lead investigator announced, "your cousin is under investigation for multiple commercial crimes. You’re required to accompany us for questioning."
###Chapter 127

The Abernathy Group had been drowning in scandal ever since Earl's arrest. And now, they'd taken Elspeth away. It all happened in the blink of an eye—no time for the Abernathy executives to react.

"Why am I being arrested? What proof do you have?" Elspeth trembled violently, her carefully crafted aristocratic demeanor shattering.

Glynnis stood frozen, her face ghostly pale, watching in horror as her mother was dragged away.

"Frederic! Save me! You have to help me!" Elspeth sobbed, tears streaking down her face.

Frederic's face burned with frustration. He wanted to intervene but couldn't risk public humiliation. Instead, he turned his fury on Evadne. "Ms. Evadne, what the hell is this?"

"Mr. Frederic, it was the prosecutor's office that took your wife. Why are you yelling at me?" Evadne smirked, utterly unbothered.

"You knew this was coming. You made those cryptic comments earlier. Did you orchestrate all of this?"

"The Ashbournes have connections everywhere. Did you really think we wouldn't know what the media already does?" Evadne's gaze turned icy with disdain.

Frederic exploded. "Ms. Evadne, just because your marriage to Thaddeus failed doesn't mean you can take it out on us!"

Mr. and Mrs. Bartley gasped.

The Ashbournes and Abernathys had been married? When? This was explosive news!

"You're so bitter over a divorce that you're sabotaging the Abernathy Group? How petty can you be?"

The words were so venomous that even Jason flinched, ready to defend Evadne.

But then, Thaddeus stepped forward.

He shielded Evadne, his expression cold and unreadable.

"Mr. Frederic, you're making accusations without proof."

"Thaddeus, you're defending her?" Frederic was livid. "She's not just causing trouble—she's actively destroying the Abernathy Group! Why protect someone like that?"

Thaddeus met Evadne's gaze, his dark eyes unreadable. She scoffed and looked away, disgusted.

Both he and his father were fools, easily manipulated by women.

"I believe she didn't do this." Thaddeus spoke slowly, deliberately.

Evadne blinked in surprise.

He turned away. "Even if we're divorced, I won't stand by while she's falsely accused."

Then, unexpectedly, he smirked. "And even if we weren't divorced, my wife doesn't need your judgment."

Evadne's lips parted slightly, her ears burning.

What the hell did that mean?

Frederic was so furious his vision blurred, his blood pressure spiking.

If not for the crowd, he would've lunged at the insolent bastard.

Evadne, satisfied with the chaos, had no interest in continuing this farce.

Her plan was working. Just one more step.

"You must have a busy day ahead. I won't keep you. Goodbye."

With that, she and Jason turned toward the ferry.

"Ms. Evadne! Wait!" Mr. Bartley hurried after her, wiping sweat from his brow. "Let's discuss the Westguard project in detail!"

"Of course." Evadne smiled, her confidence unshaken. "I'll arrange a meeting soon. Wait for my message."

"Absolutely! Anytime!" Mr. Bartley beamed.

"Ms. Evadne, if you don't mind, I'd love to introduce you to my son!" Mrs. Bartley chimed in eagerly.

Who wouldn't want to meet the daughter of Skyrim's wealthiest man?

Thaddeus' expression darkened.

Evadne didn't need to parade herself around. She was too stunning, too magnetic—too dangerous.

"Mrs. Bartley, I appreciate the offer." Evadne smiled politely. "But given my recent divorce, I'm not looking for anything romantic. Let's not waste your son's time."

"Divorce means nothing! You're leagues above those empty-headed girls!"

Glynnis flushed with rage, her nails digging into her palms as she glared at Evadne.

Evadne was like the sun—blinding, untouchable. Everything else faded in comparison.

As the ferry departed, Evadne left behind a shattered Abernathy family.

"Mr. Frederic, let's pause the Westguard collaboration for now. Perhaps another project in the future."

Mr. and Mrs. Bartley quickly excused themselves.

If this deal fell through, heads would roll—starting with his.

Frederic, desperate, realized his son had vanished.

Evadne changed out of her golf attire, slipping back into her sleek, ice-queen ensemble. She adjusted her hair and strode out in her heels.

16:50

She turned the corner—and collided with Thaddeus.

Her breath hitched. Lifting her chin, she met his glacial stare without flinching.

"Mr. Thaddeus, since when did you develop a habit of lurking outside women's changing rooms?"

"Evadne." His voice was low, dangerous. "You won't get the Westguard project."

"Oh?" She arched a brow. "What can you possibly do? The Abernathy Group is drowning in scandal. Investigations mean no contracts. Even if you tried to salvage it, it's too late."

"You claim our divorce didn't matter. So why keep provoking me?"

Thaddeus suddenly pinned her against the wall, his body caging hers. "Is this how you get your kicks? Does hurting me make you feel better?"

"Do you really believe that?" Her laugh was sharp, sending an unwelcome jolt through his chest. "Then why defend me earlier? Hypocrisy doesn't suit you."

His jaw clenched.

No matter what he did, she always found the words to cut deepest.

"Evadne, don't push me." His voice dropped to a whisper. "I won't go easy on you just because we were married."

Her eyes sparkled with challenge. "Good. Play your pieces right, Mr. Thaddeus. Otherwise, this game will be boring."

She leaned in, her breath warm against his ear. "Here's a secret—I was the one who handed Earl's evidence to the prosecutors. And I leaked it to the press. You should thank me. Your stepmother's boardroom dreams? Crushed."

His blood ran cold.

"Next time, I won't hold back."

With that, she shoved him away and walked off, a queen in retreat.

Thaddeus stood there, his chest burning.
###Chapter 128

The Abernathy Group's scandal exploded across the internet within hours, skyrocketing to the top of every trending list.

Footage of Elspeth being escorted off the golf course went viral, spreading like wildfire.

Normally, a corporate giant like the Abernathy Group could easily strong-arm the media into silence.

But Evadne had struck first. By the time they reacted, it was too late.

Their damage control efforts were futile—like trying to squeeze water from a stone.

The network airing World Wonders Weekly was backed by the powerful K Group. If Evadne wanted, they could loop the footage of Elspeth’s humiliation on repeat all day.

Internet users had already turned Elspeth and Glynnis’s disgrace into a meme collection, ripe for sharing.

Frederic scrambled to contain the fallout, running himself ragged trying to bail Elspeth out of the prosecutor’s office.

Meanwhile, Evadne, victorious, returned to the K World Hotel in high spirits.

She indulged in an extravagant afternoon tea, lounged in her office gaming, and video-called Cassius to recount the day’s triumphs.

"I’ve booked a private dining room at the hotel restaurant. We’ll meet Mr. Bartley the day after tomorrow. With any luck, we’ll finalize the Westguard deal by week’s end!"

Evadne grinned, gleefully mowing down enemies in her game.

"Elspeth is being interrogated by Arnold now. He may seem easygoing, but he’s ruthless when it comes to work. If she doesn’t give him something useful, she won’t walk out anytime soon."

On screen, Cassius sat in his CEO office, exuding quiet authority despite his smile.

"It won’t matter in the end. She’ll still be released." Evadne shrugged.

"Do you want her to stay locked up?" Cassius arched a brow.

"What can I do? We don’t have enough to pin on her."

Evadne smirked, chainsaw roaring in-game. "Elspeth didn’t climb this high just on Frederic’s favoritism. She’s cunning—her cousin Earl takes the fall while she stays clean. Her schemes are airtight."

Cassius nodded thoughtfully. "You’re right. It’s a shame."

"No shame in it." Evadne’s eyes gleamed. "As long as the K Group profits, that’s all that matters. I never intended to crush her in one move. I want her stripped of her vice-chair title and Frederic’s trust. I want him to blame her for losing this deal."

That would drive a wedge between them.

Even if she couldn’t destroy Elspeth yet, breaking her spirit was a start.

The coming days would feel like a prison for Elspeth within the Abernathy mansion.

"Evadne, know what I want most right now?" Cassius leaned forward, smiling.

"Hmm?"

"To retire immediately and hand the CEO title to you." He sighed. "No one’s more suited to lead the K Group than you."

Evadne’s mood dimmed.

The endless list of blind dates weighed on her like a tombstone. She was certain Emeric would bury it with her.

Just then, her sister Nydia called.

"Cassius, talk later. Nydia’s calling."

"Of course. She’s back in Elmsworth—spend time with her." His tone softened.

"I will. She’s my only sister. If I don’t spoil her, who will?"

Guilt gnawed at Evadne. As the youngest, Nydia should’ve been the family’s darling.

But Evadne had unwittingly stolen that spotlight. She owed Nydia, even if it wasn’t intentional.

Yet Nydia only shared good news, hiding her struggles. Evadne wanted to help but didn’t know how.

"Nydia, you’re back in Elmsworth?"

"Yes, at school." A pause. "Evadne… are you free tonight? Any plans?"

"Want to hang out?" Evadne guessed instantly.

"Yes!" Nydia’s voice brightened. "We haven’t had time since you returned. Let me treat you to dinner!"

"Just dinner? No drinks?"

"Fine, karaoke too! It’s been forever since I heard you sing."

"I’m a born diva. No one out-sings me."

Evadne cleared her throat dramatically—

Just as Frederic concluded the Abernathy Group’s emergency meeting with three directives:

First: Contain the Frost siblings’ damage, salvage the company’s reputation, and prevent a stock crash.

Second: Strip Earl of all positions and audit his department.

Third: Suspend Elspeth’s promotion to Deputy Chair pending investigation.

The executives filed out, burdened with dread.

"Thaddeus, stay." Frederic’s voice cut through the tension.

Thaddeus turned, face unreadable, and sat.

The air between them crackled.

"As president, how do you plan to handle this?" Frederic demanded.

"Business as usual." Thaddeus’s tone was ice. "Elspeth is being interrogated. Her only option is full cooperation."

"I’ll get her out!" Frederic’s voice was hoarse.

"Do you think you can?" Thaddeus’s gaze was piercing. "The prosecutor on Earl’s case is Arnold."

Frederic paled.

"Evadne planned every step. You should be worrying about tomorrow’s market crash." Thaddeus stood, done with the conversation.

"Wait!" Frederic leaned forward. "You’ve worked with Dr. Frade before. If we bring him on as a biotech advisor, it’ll stabilize our stocks. Contact him—get him here this week!"

Thaddeus arched a brow. "Fine."

Frederic exhaled in relief.

"On one condition."

"What?"

"I want to be Deputy Chair."

A slow smile curved Thaddeus’s lips.
###Chapter 129

"Alexander, are you exploiting my weakness?" Harrison's face paled with fury as he stood abruptly.

"Between father and son, it should be an equal exchange. Isn't that what you taught me growing up?" Alexander leaned back, unshaken, his voice icy. "You're never satisfied, are you? You already have more than enough. I even let you take the CEO position that should have been my brother's, and now you're eyeing the Vice Chairman seat. Why not just demand the Chairman's title while you're at it? Or are you plotting a coup?"

Harrison's lips twisted in a sneer. "Have you ever considered how much more you've taken from me than I've ever taken from you? Everything I've ever received from you came with a price. We both know why I'm CEO. Stop playing the victim. It's just us here—who are you trying to fool? Isn't it exhausting?"

Alexander's words left Harrison speechless.

"A Vice Chairman position in exchange for saving the Kingsley Group from collapse. Your choice." Alexander stood, heading for the door.

Then he paused. "Unless, of course, you're not afraid of the humiliation if you keep pushing for Victoria against all odds."

Back in his office, Alexander shut the door and clenched his fists.

A deep sigh escaped him, the weight lifting from his shoulders for the first time in years. He adjusted his tie.

Watching Harrison unravel over Victoria, powerless against Alexander's demands, was exhilarating.

But he couldn't deny—Isabella had made this possible.

Originally, Alexander only wanted to block Victoria's rise within the company. He hadn't expected the scandal to shake the Kingsley Group's stock. He couldn't afford that risk.

Yet Isabella, ever unpredictable, had turned the tables. Not only had she crushed Victoria, but she'd also given Alexander leverage over Harrison, cutting off Victoria's ambitions entirely.

As she'd said, "You should thank me for this."

But remembering her cold words and dismissive demeanor, Alexander's expression darkened.

Why should he thank her?

She'd only wanted the Kingsley Group's project. Now that she had it, they were even.

His phone buzzed.

Alexander frowned at the caller ID before answering. "What now?"

"Alex, meet me tonight."

Lucas's voice was hoarse, like a man nursing a broken heart. "I bought three limited-edition sports cars, had four actresses keep me company, and drank million-dollar champagne till dawn—but I still feel like I'm dying. Is this what heartbreak feels like? It hurts."

"You're probably having a heart attack. Go to a hospital. Don't bother me."

Just as Alexander was about to hang up, Lucas pleaded, "At least come celebrate your stepmother getting arrested with me!"

Alexander's lips thinned. "When and where?"

At six sharp, a Rolls Royce pulled up at the back entrance of the Elmsworth Film Academy.

Despite its discreet arrival, it still drew attention.

"I heard the coffee here is excellent. I'll grab some for you and Natalie," Daniel offered with a smile.

"Good. Bring Natalie back with you."

Isabella was absorbed in a document. "I tried calling her earlier—no answer. Try again when you're inside. She doesn't know we're waiting here."

Daniel stepped out, his tall frame and sharp suit immediately drawing admiring glances.

He headed straight to the café and ordered two coffees. The barista couldn't stop staring.

Then two fashionably dressed students walked in.

"Did you hear? Natalie got the lead in the graduation play!"

At her name, Daniel's attention sharpened.

"She must have slept her way into the role!"

"Totally! I just saw her in the courtyard with the hottest guy on campus. Disgusting—ah!"

The girls shrieked as Daniel suddenly dumped both coffees over them.

"Are you insane?!" Their makeup ran, fake lashes half-peeled off.

"Defamation is punishable by law," Daniel said coldly. "Be glad I don't hit women, or you wouldn't be walking out."

One girl looked terrified, but the other sneered. "What, are you Natalie's boyfriend? Too scared to check for yourself? We're not lying!"

In the courtyard, Natalie was cornered by Bernard Bishop, the campus heartthrob.

"Bernard, I've told you—I'm not interested." Her voice was firm, but her hands trembled.

"You think I'm not serious?" Bernard smirked, pulling out a velvet box. Inside gleamed a diamond-encrusted Cartier watch.

"Be my girlfriend. Sports cars, designer bags—anything you want." His grin turned predatory. "And I can satisfy you in other ways too."

Natalie recoiled, slapping the box from his hands. The watch tumbled into the dirt.

Bernard's face darkened. He grabbed her wrist. "You dare? Who do you think you are? Some princess?"

"Let go!" Natalie struggled, panic rising.

Bernard shoved her against a tree, leaning in—

A scream tore through the air.

Natalie's eyes flew open.

Through her tears, she saw Daniel—her Daniel—flinging Bernard to the ground with a single move.

But he wasn't done.

Daniel hauled Bernard up by his collar and punched him—hard.

"Stop!" Natalie rushed forward, grabbing Daniel's arm. "Please, don't!"

Bernard spat blood but still sneered. "You'll regret this! My father owns Bishop Group!"

"My name is Daniel Carter." Daniel's voice was lethal. He shrugged off his suit jacket and draped it over Natalie's shaking shoulders.

She trembled like a leaf. Without thinking, Daniel pulled her into his arms.

Natalie melted against him, her heartbeat wild.

Daniel's embrace made everything else fade away.

"Listen carefully," Daniel growled at Bernard. "Natalie is off-limits. If you touch her again, not even your father will save you."

Bernard scrambled away.

Later, after Natalie composed herself in the restroom, she found Daniel waiting outside.

"Daniel."

He turned, offering a gentle smile. "Ms. Natalie."

His tone was polite—distant.

Her heart sank. She handed back his jacket. "Thank you."

"What happened today was serious. I'm telling Isabella everything." His jaw clenched.

"No! Please, don't!" Natalie gripped his arm desperately. "If she gets involved, it'll only escalate! My parents will worry—"

"That bastard assaulted you!" Daniel's voice cracked.

"You already stopped him. He won't bother me again." Natalie swallowed hard. "I graduate soon. And... I have the Sinclair Group behind me."

Daniel hesitated, but Natalie looked up, eyes pleading.

"Daniel, trust me. Please."

He exhaled sharply. "Fine. But if he ever—"

"I know." Natalie managed a small smile. "Thank you."

But as they walked back to the car, her fingers lingered on his sleeve—just for a second.

Long enough to wish things were different.
###Chapter 130

Lucas requested Nathaniel to meet him at an upscale new karaoke lounge in Windsor Heights.

Inside the VIP suite, Lucas ordered an extravagant selection of premium liquors and proceeded to belt out a string of overly sentimental love songs.

Nathaniel sat stiffly on a plush burgundy velvet couch, nursing a glass of whiskey. His aristocratic demeanor radiated cold detachment, as if he were seated upon a throne rather than in a dimly lit entertainment venue.

The crimson lighting cast shadows around him, yet his commanding presence remained undeniable.

Nathaniel's grip on his glass tightened, his knuckles turning white. How deep did their friendship truly run for him to endure this auditory assault?

As Lucas finished another off-key ballad, Nathaniel took a measured sip of his drink, his expression unreadable.

Lucas let out a loud belch before staggering toward him, attempting to throw an arm around his shoulders.

"How was that? Still got the pipes, don't I?"

Nathaniel sidestepped swiftly, causing Lucas to stumble onto the couch. "Spectacular. You sound like a dying seagull."

"Oh, you're such a killjoy."

The memory of Isabella's scathing words and the sting of her rejection hit Lucas like a tidal wave. His mood darkened instantly. "Everyone's talking about Isabella divorcing you. Honestly, living with you must be like enduring early menopause. I admit, she was the most extraordinary woman I've ever met, and I completely blew it. I couldn't keep her."

He took a long swig before slamming the bottle onto the table. "I just don't get it. What's so special about you that she would hide her true identity and play housewife for three years? You treated her like garbage, yet she tolerated all your bullshit. And in the end, you were the one who threw her away."

"Lucas, are you finished?" Nathaniel's voice was dangerously low, his fingers tightening around his glass.

"Of course not!" Lucas's eyes were bloodshot, his resentment boiling over with liquid courage. "I don't understand! Unless you two were lovers in a past life and this is some twisted reunion, I can't fathom why she would endure so much for you!"

Even Nathaniel didn’t have the answer.

That day at the Windsor Estates, he had tried to stop her, desperate for an explanation.

The question had festered in his mind like an incurable disease. Since the night of his grandfather’s birthday, when her true identity was revealed, sleep had become a rare luxury.

Nathaniel's throat felt dry. Before he could respond, Lucas let out a bitter laugh. "Nathaniel, I admit I was a playboy. I’ve done irresponsible things. But this time, I was serious about Isabella. I keep wondering—why couldn’t I have met her sooner?"

Nathaniel remained silent, his gaze fixed on the amber liquid in his glass.

"If I had, I would’ve warned her to stay far away from you. Being with you only brings misery."

Nathaniel’s expression darkened, his fingers twitching with the urge to throttle Lucas.

When Seraphina saw Isabella, her gloom instantly dissipated, and she insisted on treating her to dinner.

Unable to refuse, Isabella chose a modest Japanese restaurant, deliberately ordering the most affordable dishes.

Though the food was mediocre, the two women chatted animatedly, clinking glasses frequently. Preston kept refilling their drinks, and by the end, the plates were nearly empty.

Seeing their joy, Preston’s own suppressed mood lightened considerably.

After a few drinks, they decided to continue the night at a karaoke bar.

Preston was about to join them when his phone rang—his brother informed him their mother was experiencing heart palpitations and needed him home immediately.

"Preston, go. Don’t worry about us," Isabella urged, waving him off.

"Seriously, Preston. Go check on your mom," Seraphina added softly. "We’ll be fine."

"Sorry, ladies. Call me if anything happens," he said apologetically before rushing off.

Isabella gave him a playful shove. "Go already, you mother hen."

Seraphina watched their interaction, her heart aching—but she couldn’t bring herself to resent Isabella.

How could she? Isabella was perfection.

If Preston had fallen for her, it was only natural.

But why would any man willingly let Isabella go?

Maybe he was terminally ill and didn’t want to burden her.

Isabella booked a high-end karaoke room. As they approached, an ear-splitting wail echoed from the neighboring suite.

"That’s not singing—that’s a crime against music," Isabella muttered, dragging Seraphina inside.

They ordered chilled beers and a lavish spread of snacks.

Both were skilled singers, and soon they were belting out tunes between laughter and drinks.

Isabella, usually composed, was slightly tipsy from celebrating her recent project’s success.

"Seraphina, I’m hitting the restroom. Stay put," she slurred, waving her off.

"You’re drunk. Let me help you."

"I’m not drunk! I’m your big sis. If anyone’s passing out, it’ll be you first."

Seraphina could only sigh in amusement.

Isabella stumbled through the hallway, the dizzying lights and mirrored walls disorienting her.

The room numbers made no sense.

Blinking blearily, she pushed open a door—and collided with a broad chest.

"Oof!"

Her heels wobbled, and she tipped backward.

A strong hand caught her waist, fingers brushing against the delicate curve.

His breath hitched.

"Miss, you’ve had too much to drink."

"I haven’t," she protested, squinting up at him.

Then, with a mischievous grin, she reached up and yanked off his sunglasses.

The man’s expression turned glacial.

The last person who’d done that had disappeared without a trace.

"Hey, you’re—" His voice faltered. His gaze swept over her face before he demanded in a low voice, "Are you Isabella?"
###Chapter 131

"You really are Little Critter, aren't you!" Evadne's cheeks flushed pink, her eyes crinkling with delight.

The man's lips curved into a smile, the icy glint in his gaze melting away. His left arm slid around her slender waist while his right hand adjusted his glasses with his middle finger. It had been years since anyone called him by that childhood nickname.

Even his father had stopped using it. But Evadne still did—boldly, unapologetically, just like when they were kids.

"Fifteen years, and you're still as stunning as ever," he murmured.

"And you're still ridiculously handsome," she shot back, grinning.

Her fingers reached up, playfully tapping his cheek with a casualness that would have been improper from anyone else. But this was Evadne—unfiltered, unguarded. If she had suddenly turned prim, he wouldn’t have recognized her.

A hiccup escaped her lips, and she swayed, struggling to stay upright.

Without hesitation, he scooped her into his arms.

"Put me down!" she protested, squirming like an indignant kitten, her face flushed crimson.

Her legs kicked beneath her dress, the movement careless and uncoordinated.

His grip tightened. "Tell me my full name, and I will."

"Your name is..." Evadne's drunken mind fumbled, the words slipping through her fingers like smoke.

"Avery Chambers. But 'Little Critter' works just fine." His breath brushed her ear as he added softly, "Though that name belongs to you alone."

Not that she heard it. The words dissolved into meaningless noise in her alcohol-clouded mind.

Avery settled her gently onto the sofa, his touch featherlight.

His phone buzzed—his secretary.

"Mr. Chambers, everyone's waiting."

"Send them home." His gaze never left Evadne's flushed face.

"Excuse me?"

"Cancel the meeting. And bring me lemonade. Now."

The secretary didn’t dare argue.

Meanwhile, Jareth had collapsed on another sofa, completely out cold after his last off-key performance.

Thaddeus scowled, irritation prickling under his skin. He snatched the half-empty bottle from the table and downed it in one go.

Then he stole one of Jareth’s cigarettes, lighting it with a sharp flick. The glow cast shadows across his sharp features, lending him a dangerous edge.

Nicotine and frustration coiled in his lungs. Ever since the divorce, his life had spiraled—smoking, drinking, no one left to scold him for it.

"Evadne... Evadne..." Jareth mumbled in his sleep, fingers clawing at his collar.

Thaddeus kicked his arm. "Shut up. She’s not coming back."

The door burst open. Gordon stood there, panting.

"Learn to knock," Thaddeus snapped.

"Sir—it's Mrs. Abernathy!"

Thaddeus shot to his feet. "Where?"

"Promise me you won’t lose your temper."

"Out with it!"

Gordon swallowed hard. "I saw her walk into a private room. A man in glasses carried her inside."

Thaddeus's vision went red. "Take me there. Now."

The lemonade arrived swiftly.

Avery held the glass to Evadne’s lips, patiently helping her sip. His secretary watched, stunned—her ruthless boss, tenderly caring for a woman?

Unthinkable.

"Better?" he asked as color returned to her cheeks.

Evadne groaned, pressing a hand to her stomach. The room had stopped spinning, but nausea still churned inside her.

"Alcohol isn’t kind to you," Avery chided, offering her water.

She blinked up at him, piecing together fragments of the night. He was handsome. Kind. And those glasses made him look unfairly refined.

"You seem familiar," she mumbled, rubbing her temple.

Avery’s smile tightened. She’d forgotten him, after all.

The door exploded inward.

Thaddeus stormed in like a hurricane.

Avery’s expression frosted over.

"Mr. Chambers, that’s Thaddeus Abernathy!" the secretary whispered urgently.

"Get him out," Avery said coldly.

The secretary stepped forward. "Mr. Abernathy, you need to—"

Thaddeus shoved past her. His towering frame loomed over Evadne, his glare lethal.

She blinked up at him, dazed. "Thaddeus? What the hell?"

"Come. Now."

He seized her wrist, yanking her toward him.

Rage burned through him. This woman—stealing his projects by day, throwing herself at strangers by night.

And that stranger? A pretentious bastard in glasses.

Had she no shame?

"Let go of me!" Evadne twisted free, still unsteady. "Who do you think you are?"

"Don’t test me," he growled, grip tightening.

Avery caught her other arm.

She gasped as pain shot through her shoulders—torn between them.

"She said no," Avery said icily. "Or do you make a habit of manhandling women?"

"This doesn’t concern you," Thaddeus snarled.

Avery adjusted his glasses. "If I’m an outsider, what are you to her?"

They answered simultaneously.

Thaddeus: "Her husband."

Evadne: "Ex."
###Chapter 132

The moment Isabella Sinclair stepped onto the red carpet, every camera lens in New York turned toward her.

She wore a daring emerald gown from Maison de Valois that clung to her curves like liquid silk. The dress plunged dangerously low in the back, revealing the delicate tattoo of a phoenix rising between her shoulder blades—a symbol Alexander Kingsley had personally designed for her.

Flashbulbs exploded like fireworks.

"Over here, Isabella!"

"Give us a spin!"

Reporters shouted over each other, their voices blending into a cacophony of adoration.

Olivia Bennett watched from the sidelines with proud tears in her eyes. "She's finally getting the recognition she deserves," she whispered to Daniel Carter.

Inside the venue, the atmosphere crackled with tension.

Nathan Prescott stood near the bar, his knuckles white around a whiskey glass. Victoria Sterling clung to his arm like a lifeline, her crimson lips twisted in a sneer. "Look at her, acting like she owns the place."

But Nathan wasn't listening. His gaze remained locked on Isabella—the woman he'd once discarded like yesterday's news.

Alexander Kingsley materialized at Isabella's side, his hand possessively settling on the small of her back. The message was clear: This queen wasn't up for grabs.

The host tapped the microphone. "And now, presenting the award for Model of the Year..."

The room held its breath.

Backstage, Sophia Reynolds adjusted her headset. "We've got a situation," she hissed into her comms. "Someone tampered with the envelope."

Isabella felt Alexander's grip tighten.

Then—

"Congratulations to our winner... Isabella Sinclair!"

The crowd erupted.

But as Isabella ascended the stage, the giant screens flickered.

Suddenly, compromising photos of her and Nathan from years ago flashed across every screen in the venue.

Gasps filled the air.

Victoria's laughter rang out like shattered glass.

Alexander's expression turned murderous.

And Isabella?

She simply smiled, leaned into the microphone, and said four words that would change everything:

"Nice try. My turn."

The screens went black.

Then new footage appeared—Victoria Sterling accepting bribes, Nathan Prescott embezzling funds, their entire empire of lies unraveling in real time.

Chaos erupted.

Security swarmed Nathan as reporters turned on him like sharks.

Alexander pulled Isabella close. "You planned this."

Her eyes glittered with triumph. "I told you I'd handle my own battles."

Backstage, Olivia high-fived Sophia. "That's our girl."

But as Isabella descended the steps, a figure emerged from the shadows—someone no one expected to see.

Evelyn Prescott stood trembling in a simple black dress, tears streaming down her face.

"Sister?" Nathan choked out.

Evelyn ignored him, walking straight to Isabella. Then, in front of everyone, she knelt.

"I'm sorry," she whispered. "For everything."

The room went silent.

Isabella studied the broken woman before her—the sister of her greatest enemy. Then she did the one thing no one anticipated.

She pulled Evelyn to her feet and embraced her.

Over Evelyn's shoulder, Isabella locked eyes with a stunned Nathan.

Checkmate.

Avery's pulse quickened as his eyes widened in shock.

The flush on Evadne's cheeks vanished as she glared at Thaddeus. "Thaddeus! How can you be so shameless and still keep a straight face? Let go of me. I'm not going anywhere with you!" No matter how much she struggled or cursed, his expression remained unreadable. His grip only tightened, determined to drag her away.

Seeing Evadne drunk and unconscious in a private room with a stranger—Thaddeus couldn't stomach it.

"Thaddeus! You bastard, release me!"

But the man of few words didn't bother with explanations. In one swift motion, he bent down and hauled her over his shoulder, his muscular arm locking around her thighs. Without a word, he strode out, his face an impassive mask.

"Put me down—ugh—I'm gonna be sick!"

Evadne pounded her fists against his broad back, the nausea churning in her stomach making her eyes water.

"Go ahead. Vomit all you want." His voice was ice. No sympathy.

Good. Let her suffer. She deserved it.

As they disappeared from the room, Avery's lips pressed into a thin line, his knuckles whitening around the glass Evadne had sipped from. His secretary shifted nervously.

"Mr. Chambers, should we follow them?"

"Have someone tail them."

Avery's voice was clipped. His thumb traced the faint lipstick stain on the rim of the glass.

"Thaddeus is married?" His secretary gaped. "Since when? How did we miss this?"

"Dig deeper."

Avery took a slow sip from the glass, his eyes cold behind his glasses. "I want everything on Thaddeus—his past, his present. And especially his relationship with her."

Thaddeus had intended to take Evadne back to his private room, but with Jareth there, he changed course. Instead, he carried her straight out of the KTV.

Patrons and staff stared, but no one dared intervene. Just another couple's drunken spat—or so they assumed.

"Thaddeus—I swear—I'm gonna puke—"

Evadne's voice was a breathless whimper, her stomach lurching with every step.

His jaw clenched. "You brought this on yourself."

The moment he set her down, she shoved him hard against the car door.

His breath hitched.

Her hands fisted in his shirt, her face flushed, lips parted.

Then—

Ugh.

Thaddeus froze.

She'd just emptied the contents of her stomach all over his pristine suit.

The stench of alcohol and seafood hit him like a punch. His face darkened.

Unbelievable. She'd used him as a human trash can.

"Thaddeus, are you haunting me? Get lost! The sight of you makes me sick!"

She tried to push away, but he seized her wrists, his eyes burning.

"Who the hell was that man?"

"A friend. Got a problem with that?" She smirked, her drunken gaze taunting.

"Yes." The word ripped from his throat before he could stop it.

"You're insane!" She writhed in his grip, her cheeks flushed, her beauty magnified by the alcohol. "You parade your ex around, but I can't have friends? Who do you think you are?"

The memory of how close she'd been to that man—how he'd looked at her—sent a possessive fury surging through Thaddeus's veins.

"Your social life's gotten colorful," he sneered, his chest tight with something darker than anger. "Booking a private room? Didn't want interruptions?"

But the words cut him deeper.

Evadne laughed, sharp and bitter. "Oh, Thaddeus, you have no idea what I'm capable of now."

"Evadne!" His control snapped. "You're coming with me. And you won't be seeing him again."

Just then, a patrol car rolled by.

Evadne's expression shifted instantly—wide-eyed, trembling. "Help! This man's assaulting me!"

Thaddeus paled.

Two officers jumped out, shouting, "Step away from her!"

Seizing her chance, Evadne wrenched free.

"I—I accidentally spilled on his suit," she stammered, tears welling. "I offered to pay for cleaning, but he wouldn't let me leave!"

The officers turned on Thaddeus. "Sir, this constitutes harassment. You'll need to come with us."

Thaddeus exhaled sharply. "I know her."

The officer glanced at Evadne. "Do you know this man?"

She shook her head, her lower lip quivering. "No."

The officer's grip tightened. "You're under detention."

Then—his phone rang.

Frederic's voice was frantic. "Where are you? Acacia slit her wrists! She's at Elmsworth—losing blood—"

Thaddeus's blood ran cold.

"Thaddeus, fix this mess!" Frederic roared. "First you propose, then you take it back? She saved you when you tried to kill yourself as a kid! And now you're killing her!"

The past crashed over him—memories he'd buried.

His breath came in ragged gasps.

When he looked up—Evadne was gone.

Vanished into the neon-lit night.
###Chapter 133

The nausea subsided as I returned to the KTV, but the brief happiness from spending time with my little sister evaporated instantly.

Of all people, why did I have to run into that bastard again?

Maybe I should visit a church soon—pray for some divine intervention to keep the night from going downhill.

Then, a small hand gently tugged at my sleeve.

Looking down into Nydia's worried eyes, I forced a smile. "I'm fine."

"Evadne, was that guy your ex-husband?" Nydia wrapped her arm around my waist, concern lacing her voice.

"Yeah." My response was flat, drained.

"Wow, he's gorgeous!" Her eyes sparkled with unfiltered admiration. "I thought my brothers were the epitome of handsome, but your ex is on another level! A CEO who looks like that? He could be a Hollywood A-lister!"

I rubbed my temples. "Enough."

"You weren't kidding when you said he was hotter than movie stars. I didn’t believe you before, but now I see it!"

"Handsome doesn’t make him less of an ass. And stop calling him that."

It was too late to head back to campus, so Nydia stayed at my villa for the night.

Normally, I could hold my liquor, but tonight, the alcohol hit harder. My head throbbed as I leaned against the car window, breathing slowly.

"Evadne, let me help." Nydia’s fingers pressed gently against my temples, massaging in small circles.

I rested against her, inhaling the faint floral scent clinging to her skin. Even drunk, she smelled like spring.

Nydia swallowed hard, her gaze lingering on my face.

Who looked this stunning while wasted? It wasn’t fair.

When we reached the villa gates, I told the driver to stop. Walking always helped sober me up before bed.

Arm in arm, Nydia and I strolled down the quiet path.

The night breeze was crisp, the moon bright, stars scattered like diamonds. The peaceful scenery should’ve calmed me—but then my grip on Nydia tightened.

"Evadne?"

"Someone’s following us." My voice dropped to a whisper.

Nydia tensed, her palm slick with sweat as she glanced around.

"Don’t panic. If they try anything, I’ll make them regret it." My lips curled into a smirk.

After that fight with Thaddeus, I was itching for a real brawl.

"Show yourself!" I snapped.

A rustle came from the bushes.

Instinct kicked in. I shoved Nydia behind me just as a towering figure emerged—muscular, clad in black, face hidden behind a mask.

Nydia gasped.

I stayed still, assessing. He moved like a trained fighter, but I wasn’t worried. Few could match me—or Thaddeus, for that matter.

"Which one of you is Evadne?" His accent was thick, foreign.

"That’d be me. Got a problem?" I arched a brow, unflinching.

A blade flashed in his hand. He lunged.

"Evadne!" Nydia screamed as I shoved her aside.

"Run!"

But she didn’t.

The fight erupted in a blur of motion—kicks, dodges, strikes. The wind whipped around us as we exchanged blows.

Nydia gaped, wide-eyed. "Go, Evadne!"

Seriously? Cheering now?

"Call the police!"

She fumbled for her phone.

The masked man pivoted, targeting her instead.

Nydia froze, eyes squeezed shut as the knife arced toward her—

A pained grunt.

Her eyes flew open.

I stood between them, blood soaking through my sleeve.

"Evadne!" Her voice cracked.

Gritting my teeth, I clutched my arm. The pain was white-hot, dizzying.

This wasn’t just an attack. He wanted me dead.

As he raised the knife again, a shadow blurred past—someone grabbed his collar and wrenched him back.

Seizing the opening, I spun, my foot connecting with his wrist. The blade clattered to the ground.

A sickening snap.

The man howled as both his arms were twisted behind him.

I blinked. "You?"

Avery stood over him, his polished shoe grinding into the man’s back.

"Fancy meeting you here," he said, smiling like this was a casual stroll.

"Evadne!" Jason’s voice cut through the night as he sprinted toward us.

"Jason! She’s hurt!" Nydia’s tears spilled over.

His face paled at the blood. "Who did this to you?"

"Why are you here?" I winced. "Your mom—"

"Not now!" His hands trembled as he reached for me. "You need a hospital!"

I stepped back. "It’s just a scratch. Take care of Nydia."

His jaw clenched.

I wasn’t fragile. I wouldn’t break.

"Evadne, please." Nydia sobbed. "This is my fault—"

"Don’t be ridiculous." I wiped her tears. "I’m the one who put you in danger."

Nearby, Avery’s bodyguards hauled the attacker into a car.

"You okay?" His secretary looked shaken.

"Fine." Avery dusted off his sleeves, then met my gaze.

I approached him. "Thank you. But I need that man."

His lips quirked. "I’ll hand him over—on one condition."

"What?"

Before I could react, he swept me into his arms.

I yelped, staring up at him.

"First, the hospital." His voice was firm. "Then you can do whatever you want."
###Chapter 134

The emergency room at Elmsworth Hospital was tense.

Acacia had received a blood transfusion, but her condition remained critical.

When she was first brought in, her skin was ghostly pale, her wrist marred by a deep, alarming gash.

Outside, her parents stood with Frederic and Glynnis.

Una, Acacia’s mother, was inconsolable. She kept calling her daughter’s name between sobs, her voice breaking with every syllable.

"Enough!" Mr. Stirling snapped, his patience wearing thin. "You’re not a child anymore. Stop making a scene. Do you want people to laugh at us?"

"Laugh at us?" Una whirled on him, her face streaked with tears. "Our daughter is fighting for her life, and you’re worried about dignity? Do you even have a heart?" She grabbed his collar, her hands shaking. "Our son is already gone. Acacia is all I have left. If she doesn’t make it, I won’t either!"

Mr. Stirling’s expression darkened. His daughter had harmed herself over a man, and now his wife was causing a spectacle.

He had always felt inferior to Frederic, and this humiliation only made it worse. In frustration, he shoved Una away.

"Stop acting like a madwoman! This is a hospital, not some street market. Have you forgotten you’re the wife of a chairman?"

Una stumbled back, landing hard on the floor. Shock replaced her tears.

"Enough!" Glynnis stepped in, helping Una up while masking her disdain. "The priority is Acacia’s survival. Fighting won’t help her."

Inside, she couldn’t care less about the girl. But with her own mother under investigation, she had to play the role of the concerned friend.

"Mr. Frederic," Mr. Stirling turned on him, his anger redirected. "Your son owes us an explanation!"

His voice was sharp. "Acacia has been devoted to Thaddeus for years. Their engagement is public knowledge. After Mr. Hamiltion’s birthday, they were supposed to marry. But your son drags his feet with the divorce, then backs out? Is this how you repay my daughter’s loyalty? You’re pushing her to her death!"

Frederic remained silent, his expression grim.

"We may not be as powerful as the Abernathys, but we have our pride!" Una spat, her eyes blazing. "If Thaddeus abandons Acacia, we’ll make sure the world knows. Your family will never know peace again!"

She knew exactly what she was doing.

Acacia’s suicide attempt was a desperate gamble—one meant to force Thaddeus’s hand.

Frederic exhaled heavily. With Elspeth’s scandal already looming, another public crisis would devastate the Abernathy name.

"Mr. Stirling," he finally said, his voice firm. "Once Acacia wakes, tell her this—Thaddeus will marry her. Nothing will change that."

The couple’s tension eased slightly.

But Una still doubted. Thaddeus wasn’t the same powerless boy anymore. Would he really obey his father’s orders?

Footsteps echoed down the hall.

Thaddeus arrived, his face ashen, Gordon trailing behind.

"How is she?"

Before Frederic could answer, Una lunged forward, grabbing Thaddeus’s collar.

"Look what you’ve done!" she shrieked. "Are you trying to kill her so you can run back to your ex-wife?"

"Mrs. Stirling, please!" Gordon quickly intervened, pulling her away.

The commotion drew stares from nearby onlookers.

"Calm down?" Una’s voice cracked. "My daughter is dying because of you! She saved your life when you tried to kill yourself! And this is how you repay her?"

Thaddeus’s head throbbed.

Memories he had buried resurfaced—dark, suffocating.

Meanwhile, Evadne had been taken to the hospital by Avery for treatment.

She hadn’t let Jason come, insisting he stay with Nydia to keep her calm.

Thankfully, her injuries weren’t severe—just deep enough to require stitches and a tetanus shot.

Her jacket, torn and bloodied, had been discarded. Now, she wore only a thin red dress, her bandaged arm exposed.

Avery noticed her discomfort and draped his own jacket over her shoulders.

"It’s cold outside," he murmured.

Evadne hesitated, then relented when he tightened the fabric around her.

"Your sister and secretary would panic if they saw this," he reasoned.

She sighed. He was right.

"Sir, how did you happen to be there earlier?"

"I live in that area," Avery lied smoothly.

"Really? What a coincidence." Her tone was light, but she didn’t press further.

"You didn’t even flinch during treatment," he remarked, admiration in his gaze. "You’re the strongest woman I’ve ever met."

"Many women are strong," she replied with a polite smile.

Avery’s lips curved. I don’t care about others. Only you.

"Thank you for your help," she added, "but please—no more sudden embraces. I don’t like strangers touching me."

His expression turned apologetic. "I acted on instinct when I saw you hurt. It won’t happen again."

She nodded, accepting his sincerity.

"By the way," he began, "I never got your name—"

A cold voice cut through the air.

"Evadne."
###Chapter 135

The moment Isabella Sinclair stepped into the lobby of The Regal Palace, all eyes turned toward her.

She wasn’t just any model—she was the woman who had taken the fashion world by storm.

Nathan Prescott stood near the elevators, his expression unreadable. Beside him, Victoria Sterling clung to his arm, her lips curled into a smug smile.

Isabella ignored them both.

Olivia Bennett, her ever-loyal manager, leaned in. "Don’t let them get to you," she murmured.

Isabella didn’t respond. She didn’t need to.

The elevator doors slid open, revealing Alexander Kingsley.

His presence alone commanded silence.

Nathan stiffened. Victoria’s grip on his arm tightened.

Alexander’s gaze locked onto Isabella. "You’re late."

She met his eyes without flinching. "Traffic."

A flicker of amusement crossed his face.

The tension in the lobby was palpable.

Nathan finally spoke, his voice dripping with false politeness. "Alexander. What a surprise."

Alexander didn’t even glance at him. "Isabella, we have a meeting."

She stepped forward without hesitation.

Victoria’s smile faltered.

As the elevator doors closed behind them, Olivia exhaled sharply. "That was intense."

Isabella smirked. "Just another day."

Upstairs, the real battle was about to begin.

Evadne froze, a shiver running down her spine as she slowly turned around.

Her gaze was ice-cold.

A few feet away, Thaddeus stood alone, his piercing eyes locked onto her and Avery. His rigid posture betrayed the slightest tremor.

When his gaze landed on her bandaged arm, his chest tightened painfully. Without thinking, he took a step forward, drawn to her.

"What happened to your hand?"

Evadne recoiled, instinctively putting distance between them, giving Avery the opening to shield her protectively.

Thaddeus's throat constricted as his eyes clashed with the other man's. The air between them crackled with tension.

"I won't let you get away with this again."

Avery adjusted his glasses, his gaze sharpening dangerously. "You already took her from me once tonight. Planning to do it again?"

"What's your relationship with her?" Thaddeus demanded, voice hard.

He'd been fooled by Evadne's brothers before. Was this man another of Emeric's sons?

But the way Evadne looked at him—soft, meaningful—wasn't how siblings regarded each other.

"Our relationship is closer than yours," Evadne said flatly, her words cutting deep. "And he means more to me than you ever did."

Avery glanced back at her, satisfaction curling his lips.

"Thaddeus, I already told you outside the karaoke bar. I don't understand why you're still hung up on this. What's the point?"

Thaddeus's eyes burned red. "Evadne, don't you know how to be grateful? You got drunk with some stranger. I was worried—"

"His concern makes me grateful," she interrupted, disgust twisting her features. "Yours makes me sick. I've already thrown up once tonight, Mr. Thaddeus. Spare me a second round."

Her words were a blade to his heart.

Thaddeus's lips paled, his chest aching.

Tonight had been one shock after another, leaving him unsteady. He felt like he was breaking.

They were over. So why did he still care?

Did he regret it? Did he regret the divorce?

Doubt gnawed at him.

Had he been wrong? Had he been wrong from the start?

"Mr. Thaddeus! Ms. Acacia is stable now!"

Gordon's voice shattered the moment as he rushed over, oblivious to Evadne's presence—until it was too late.

The tension between Thaddeus and Evadne was palpable. Gordon wished he could take back his words.

"Mr. Thaddeus, so you already have another woman," Avery mused, chuckling darkly. "Then why are you still harassing Ms. Evadne? What exactly do you want from her?"

Thaddeus's expression darkened. Even Gordon stiffened in surprise.

That was a low blow.

Evadne's eyes flickered with shock.

He knew who she was.

"If you're divorced, you should leave her alone. That's common decency."

Avery's gaze turned frigid as he assessed Thaddeus. "Seems you're not much of a gentleman."

"What did you just say?" Gordon bristled, stepping forward defensively.

"Enough. Let's go." Evadne tugged at Avery's sleeve, unwilling to make a scene.

"Of course." Avery's demeanor shifted instantly, his smile warm as he fell into step beside her.

Thaddeus watched them disappear, his emotions in turmoil.

So there was already someone else in Evadne's life.

His hand pressed against his chest, as if trying to stifle the ache.

Only now did he truly understand—they were really over.

In the parking garage, Jason hurried forward as soon as he spotted them.

"Miss, how's your arm?"

"I'm fine. What about the attacker?" That was all she cared about right now.

"Don't worry. He's been discreetly relocated to the Black Room." Jason lowered his voice.

"Good. We have work to do in the coming days." Evadne's eyes gleamed with quiet danger as she patted his shoulder.

Jason nodded firmly. "Ready whenever you are."

"Wait here. I need to say goodbye."

Evadne turned back to Avery, who stood beside his Bentley, effortlessly elegant.

"After tonight, you've seen how complicated things are between Thaddeus and me." She met his gaze, guilt lacing her voice. "I had no choice but to drag you into this. I'm sorry."

"Don't apologize. Being of use to you is an honor." His tone was smooth, charming.

Evadne bit her lip. His words only made her feel worse.

"If you ever need me again, just say the word." He smiled.

"You're joking." She sighed. "I hope there won't be a next time."

"Keep the wound dry for a week. Watch your diet." His gaze lingered, reluctant. "It's late. You should go home."

Avery knew when to step back. With a final glance, he slid into the car.

"Wait!" Evadne tapped the window.

It rolled down, revealing his expectant expression.

"How did you know to call me 'Ms. Evadne' in front of Thaddeus? How did you know my name? Did you recognize me from the beginning?" The questions tumbled out. She wouldn't sleep tonight without answers.

"Yes." His gaze held hers, unflinching.

"I rarely appear in public. Only a handful of people know who I am. How did you? Have we met before?" Her eyes sparkled with curiosity.

Avery smirked. "I'll tell you next time."

Before she could protest, his secretary and bodyguard ushered him into the car. The luxury vehicles sped off, leaving Evadne standing there.

She groaned. "Damn it! I forgot to ask his name again!"

The Bentley cut through the neon-lit night.

Avery stared out the window, the city lights blurring. But all he saw was Evadne's striking face.

His fingers traced the cool glass absently.

"Evadne. I never expected to run into you like this."

"Mr. Chambers, I looked into Thaddeus and her. There's no marriage record, but they finalized their divorce this month," the secretary reported, voice rising. "Which means Ms. Evadne is single now!"

"I don't care. She said I mean more to her than Thaddeus. That I'm closer to her heart." The memory sent his pulse racing.

"Congratulations, Mr. Chambers! You won this round!"

"Not enough." Avery's usually cool eyes warmed at the thought of her. "I want to be the only one in her heart."
###Chapter 136

The first light of dawn painted the sky when Seraphina finally returned to her private villa.

Olivia had been waiting all night, her eyes red and puffy from crying. The sight of her sister's distress twisted Seraphina's heart.

"Olivia, stop blaming yourself. I'm perfectly fine." Seraphina sat beside her, pulling her into a tight embrace. "Don't you have an audition tomorrow? You need rest."

"Seraphina, am I just dead weight?" Olivia's voice trembled, tears welling up again. "You've always protected me since we were kids, and now that I'm grown, I still can't do anything for you."

"Don't talk nonsense." Seraphina tapped her forehead lightly. "You and Arabella bring warmth to this family. You're our precious little sister—our lucky charm. If you really want to help me, chase your dreams. When you make it big in Hollywood, you can endorse my brands. Think of the money I'll save. Deal?"

"Seraphina, I won't let you down! I will make it!" Olivia wiped her tears, nodding with fierce determination.

After a quick shower, Olivia collapsed into bed, asleep the moment her head hit the pillow.

Seraphina tucked her in before slipping out of the room.

In the study, Nathaniel was already waiting.

"Victoria was rushed to the hospital tonight. Any idea why?" Seraphina's voice turned icy as she settled onto the sofa.

"We found out. She slit her wrists. A suicide attempt, but she was saved in time." Nathaniel paused, his gaze sharpening. "And Adrian never left her side."

"Of course he didn't." Seraphina scoffed, unfazed. "She nearly died for him. Even if he were a corpse, he'd crawl to her bedside."

"Ms. Seraphina, what do you make of this?"

"Victoria trying to kill herself? That's the funniest joke I've heard all year." Seraphina leaned back, rubbing her temples. "She hasn't even become Mrs. Vanderbilt yet. She hasn't destroyed me. Why would she give up now? People who genuinely want to die don't get caught. Failing is just embarrassing."

"So you think she's manipulating Adrian?"

Nathaniel frowned. "But why? Isn't their wedding around the corner? Unless... he's having second thoughts?"

Seraphina's chest tightened. "Who knows? Maybe he's engaged to one woman but eyeing another. He already dumped me. Victoria could be next. Adrian's a playboy—nothing surprises me anymore."

"Logical. But I hope they marry and leave everyone else alone."

Nathaniel clenched his jaw before shifting topics. "Ms. Seraphina, who sent that man after you tonight? Could it be Eleanor? She's still detained by Mr. Vanderbilt. She wouldn't have the opportunity."

"He was foreign. A fighter—agile, like an underground brawler. No formal style, but brutally efficient." Seraphina's eyes darkened. "Eleanor doesn't have the connections, and Genevieve wouldn't know people like that. Only Victoria fits. She spent three years abroad, mingling in questionable circles. I wouldn't be surprised if she has a few brainless, muscle-bound lackeys at her disposal."

Nathaniel blinked, impressed by her deduction.

"As for why he had a grudge against me, speculation won't help. We'll interrogate him tomorrow."

Seraphina suddenly leaned forward. "Wait—you didn’t tell Sebastian anything, did you?"

Nathaniel sighed. "Ms. Seraphina, I wouldn’t dare disobey you. President Lockwood knows nothing."

"Good."

The moment she relaxed, her phone rang.

Sebastian.

Her pulse spiked. She grabbed the phone but hesitated.

Then Nathaniel's phone buzzed. He had no choice but to answer.

"President Lockwood, how can I assist you?"

"Put Seraphina on. Now."

Though not on speaker, Sebastian's voice was so deep it vibrated through the room, making Seraphina's heart hammer.

"Ms. Seraphina is asleep, President Lockwood."

"Nathaniel." Sebastian's tone turned lethal. "Since when do you lie to me? One more chance. Put her on, or by sunrise, you're no longer her secretary."

Seraphina snatched the phone, her voice soft. "Sebastian."

A heavy pause. Then, low and controlled: "Come outside. We need to talk."

Heart racing, Seraphina stepped past the villa gates.

Under the golden glow of streetlights, Sebastian stood beside a sleek black car, his tall frame immaculate in a gray suit.

A breathtaking sight—but Seraphina was too nervous to appreciate it.

"Sebastian." She tiptoed closer, whispering.

"It's cold. Get in."

Without hesitation, he shrugged off his jacket and draped it over her slender shoulders before guiding her into the car.

11:06 PM

In the backseat, Sebastian finally snapped. Gripping her shoulders, he demanded, "Where did that bastard hurt you?"

"My arm."

She couldn't lie anymore, hanging her head like a scolded child.

Sebastian paled. His fingers trembled as he rolled up her sleeve, revealing the white bandage beneath. His eyes glistened.

"It's shallow. Doesn't even hurt now," she rushed to explain.

Sebastian released her sleeve only to seize her hand, squeezing too tight.

She winced but stayed silent, guilt gnawing at her. "I'm sorry. I didn’t want you to worry. I thought I could handle it."

A long silence. Then, through gritted teeth: "Whoever touched my sister will pay."

Her breath hitched.

The man before her had once been ruthless—a shadowy kingpin. Though reformed, that darkness still lurked beneath the surface.

"Sebastian, you promised me." She pressed her cheek to his chest. "We left that life behind. That man is just a pawn. Punishing him won’t expose the mastermind. The Vanderbilts are cunning. If the enemy handed us leverage, we should use it wisely."

The murderous glint faded. He exhaled sharply, then grabbed a folder from the front seat.

"Look at this."

Seraphina opened it—and gasped. "What is this?"

"Nathaniel told me about your attacker. He’s desperate to find who sent him, so he came to me." Sebastian’s voice was steel. "But he didn’t mention your injury. Coward."

"I ordered him not to! Don’t blame him." Despite her irritation, she defended Nathaniel.

"If this happens again, I’m sending him back to the Sinclair estate."

She swallowed, wisely staying quiet.

Sebastian’s anger was rare but terrifying. Even Seraphina, who fearlessly defied Reginald, turned meek under his glare.

She focused on the documents—then froze.

"It’s him!"
###Chapter 137

The file revealed everything.

His name was Gregory, and along with his complete background check, there was a detailed report on his plastic surgery.

A full facial reconstruction.

Isabella remembered Gregory's original appearance. Just as Alexander had shown her before—he was Seraphina's personal trainer boyfriend from abroad.

"That's him! The one who assaulted Seraphina!"

Isabella couldn't contain her fury, the words bursting out before she could stop them.

The image of Seraphina being groped was seared into her memory.

Nathaniel cleared his throat, a wry smile on his lips. "Isabella, language."

"Typical Seraphina," Isabella scoffed.

Nathaniel's gaze darkened, simmering with barely restrained rage. "I thought she was just playing petty games. I underestimated her."

"But why would he need such extensive plastic surgery?" Isabella narrowed her eyes. "Unless Seraphina demanded it?"

"Keep reading," Nathaniel urged softly.

Isabella flipped through more pages and froze at a gambling debt contract.

"Half a million in debt. He's a gambler."

Nathaniel's voice was calm. "He's drowning in debt. Casinos, banks, loan sharks—they're all after him. The surgery was to disappear."

Isabella connected the dots instantly. "He was desperate. Broke. So he went to Seraphina, knowing she's loaded now as the future Mrs. CEO."

"Then Seraphina exploited his greed."

Nathaniel's breath turned heavy. He pulled Isabella into his arms, his eyes burning with fury. "Her condition was for him to hurt you."

"These two haven't finalized their deal yet. If Seraphina knew he'd make a move on me tonight, she wouldn't have staged her suicide attempt now."

Isabella looked at Nathaniel with admiration. "But in just a few hours, you've uncovered everything—even his gambling debts. Are you secretly a guardian angel?"

"Coincidence." Nathaniel ruffled her hair gently. "The casino he frequents used to be under my control. My people are still there. One word, and they spill everything."

Isabella's jaw dropped.

Nathaniel was that powerful?

Meanwhile—

Seraphina's suicide attempt had devastated Sebastian. Harrison moved swiftly to suppress the news, determined to protect the Kingsley family's reputation.

In the study, father and son clashed once more.

"Sebastian, there's only one solution now. Marry Seraphina immediately!" Harrison commanded. "If there's no time for a wedding, then an engagement—but do it now. Don't let this escalate further!"

"I'll help her recover from her depression," Sebastian said firmly. "But I won't marry her."

Harrison shot to his feet. "What did you say?"

"You heard me."

"Weren't you the one insisting on marrying her? You divorced Isabella in secret, desperate to make Seraphina your wife! Now you've abandoned your ex-wife, and your fiancée tried to kill herself because of you! What the hell is wrong with you? Are you even my son?"

Sebastian laughed coldly, the sound piercing Harrison's heart.

"You think this is funny?" Harrison snarled.

"Yes."

"Sebastian!" Harrison slammed his fist on the desk.

"If you'd told me to marry her for the company's sake, I might have respected your honesty. But using morality to pressure me? I learned that from you." Sebastian's voice was steel.

His bitter smile was impossible to read—mocking Harrison or himself.

Harrison stiffened. "What did you say?"

"Seraphina has changed. She's not the woman I wanted to marry anymore. I can't force myself to do it." Sebastian lowered his head, pain flickering in his eyes. "But she saved my life. If not for her, I wouldn't be here. I'll help her recover. And when she does, I'll end things properly."

"You're breaking up with Seraphina?" Harrison couldn't believe his ears.

"Yes."

"Sebastian, she has severe depression! She tried to kill herself because the wedding was postponed! If you dump her now, you might as well push her off a cliff yourself!"

"That's why I won't do it now. I'll wait until she's stable." Sebastian's resolve was unshakable.

Harrison collapsed into his chair, studying his son with narrowed eyes. "Is this because of Isabella?"

Sebastian's chest tightened, but he denied it instantly. "No."

"You may not have grown up with me, but I know my own son!" Harrison's voice turned sharp. "After your grandfather's birthday party, when Alexander took Isabella home, you were reluctant. I heard you even drove her back that day. You humiliated Seraphina in front of her. Sebastian, you've never been indecisive. If you didn't want something, you'd drop it without a second thought. So why can't you let Isabella go? Why do you keep giving in to her? And you still claim you don't love her?"

"I said it before. My decision about Seraphina has nothing to do with Isabella."

Sebastian stood abruptly, veins bulging in his neck. "Even if it weren't Isabella, Seraphina had no right to frame and hurt others."

"It's because she loves you! If she only cared about your status, why would she bother with Isabella? Women get jealous—especially over the men they love most! And Isabella is your ex-wife. Isn't it natural for Seraphina to feel threatened?"

As Harrison spoke, he thought of Eleanor.

Back then, Eleanor had been just like Seraphina—tearful, manipulative, clinging to him with desperate love.

To him, that was devotion. He believed Seraphina loved Sebastian deeply, just as Eleanor had loved him.

"Isabella used to love me too."

The words left Sebastian's lips before he could stop them, a pang of regret following instantly. "In our three years of marriage, she never hurt anyone. Since when did love become an excuse to destroy people?"

He didn't wait for Harrison's response, turning to leave.

"Sebastian! Are you going to let the Kingsley Group fall into ruin?"

"Don't worry. Even without marrying Seraphina, I won't let that happen."
###Chapter 138

Sebastian staggered out of the study, his face ashen. His chest constricted painfully, as if an invisible weight threatened to crush him.

Evangeline was like a festering wound on his soul—one he couldn't bear to touch. The slightest brush against the memory sent searing agony through him, threatening to shatter him completely.

But what terrified him more than Evangeline herself was the undeniable truth: she had once loved him.

Sebastian had always carried himself with unshakable pride, even as a boy. Hunger and hardship had never broken his spirit or forced him to bow to anyone.

"Mr. Sebastian," Preston hurried toward him, voice low. "Three urgent updates."

"Speak." Sebastian steadied himself, a thin sheen of sweat forming on his brow.

"First, Ms. Seraphina is awake but unstable. She's demanding to see you."

Sebastian's eyes darkened. "And the second?"

"The chairman secured a high-profile lawyer for Eloise. She'll be released tomorrow morning. Rumor has it her cousin, Earl, took full responsibility, clearing her name." Preston's tone dripped with disdain.

"Who's the lawyer?" Sebastian's jaw tightened.

"Cedric Lockwood."

Sebastian cursed inwardly. Frederic was playing chess, not checkers—pulling strings to enlist Cedric, a legal powerhouse.

Preston leaned closer. "Here's the twist—Cedric is the brother of Mrs. Kingsley's personal secretary, Jason Lockwood. Turns out Jason is the baby of the Lockwood family. Hard to believe, right?"

A flicker of surprise crossed Sebastian's face.

The Lockwoods weren't social elites, but their legal influence was unmatched. Patriarch David Lockwood was a legendary judge, renowned for his impartiality. His eldest son, Cedric, had never lost a case. The middle son, Ivan, was equally formidable on the bench.

Then there was Jason—the youngest, seemingly unremarkable. But a glance at his résumé would leave anyone speechless.

Top-tier education. Youngest doctorate holder in history. He could've coasted on his looks, but instead, he buried himself in books, earning full scholarships and perfect grades.

Yet this prodigy chose to serve as Evangeline's secretary—practically her glorified errand boy.

Sebastian shouldn't underestimate the caliber of people surrounding Evangeline.

Bitter resentment rose in his throat. "Eloise's release was inevitable. But she'll never set foot on the Board again. That door is sealed."

"Mrs. Kingsley is ruthless! She dismantled the opposition in one move. Like it or not, we benefited from her strategy." Preston grinned, rubbing his hands.

Sebastian shot him a glacial glare. "If you admire her so much, why don't you beg for a job under her?"

Preston froze.

"I've won countless battles, yet I've never seen you this thrilled. Remember who signs your paycheck."

Preston swallowed hard.

"What's the third update?"

"Oh! The man with Mrs. Kingsley that night—I identified him! You won't believe it!" Preston's eyes gleamed with drama.

Sebastian's gaze turned arctic. "Who?"

"Avery Chambers—youngest son of the Chambers Group chairman! He's been living in Helgen and just returned to Elmsworth!"

Avery? The Chambers Group?

Sebastian's pulse spiked.

The Chambers Group dominated half of Elmsworth's projects. Business circles whispered that the Kingsleys ruled the south while the Chambers controlled the north.

Both families boasted billions in assets, divided by a river. They maintained a fragile truce, but the rivalry simmered beneath the surface.

Sebastian had heard rumors that K Group and Chambers Group had collaborated on major international ventures. Their chairmen were old friends, their alliance spanning decades.

Had Evangeline and Avery known each other since childhood?

The way they'd looked at each other—exclusive, intimate—suggested a history. Were they childhood sweethearts?

Preston sighed enviously. "It makes sense. Mrs. Kingsley is Emeric's favorite. Everyone in her orbit is elite. Even Jason, the Lockwood heir, is just her assistant."

He side-eyed his boss, pity creeping in.

Sebastian might be CEO and soon vice-chairman, but his achievements paled next to Evangeline's.

Didn't that make him the ultimate trophy husband?

Sebastian's knuckles whitened, a vein throbbing at his temple. He braced against the wall, fist clenching.

What game was that woman playing, surrounding herself with men from powerful dynasties?

He pinched the bridge of his nose, voice strained. "Preston, fetch my migraine pills."

Elsewhere

11:06 PM

A sleek emerald Rolls-Royce glided to a stop outside the abandoned warehouse known as the Black Room.

Purchased years ago by K Group, the derelict building sat in Wye's outskirts. Emeric had foreseen the area's future value—rumors of an upcoming subway line made it a shrewd investment.

The basement was damp, dark, and reeked of decay. Prisoners here endured hell.

Knowing this, Cassius refused to let his sister face it alone. He accompanied her tonight.

"Sir. Ma'am." Two guards bowed as they approached.

"How's our guest?" Evangeline's tone was icy.

"Still breathing."

The words carried weight.

Evangeline nodded, descending the stairs with Cassius.

The stench of mildew and rot assaulted them. A rat skittered past Evangeline's stilettos, but she didn't flinch. She'd endured worse during her Doctors Without Borders missions.

Under flickering lights, George dangled upside down, his face swollen and purple from congestion.

Seeing them, he writhed like a trapped insect, snot and tears streaming upward. "I was wrong! Ms. Evangeline, spare me! I'll do anything!"

The man who'd threatened her with such bravado had cracked in three days.

Cassius tensed, but Evangeline stopped him with a glance.

"We agreed—I handle this. No interference."

"Fine." Cassius exhaled sharply, stepping back.

Evangeline crossed her arms, striding forward. Without warning, she drove her stiletto into George's shoulder.

He swung violently, gagging.

"Ms. Evangeline! I didn't know it was you! If I had, I'd never have listened to that witch Seraphina!"

George's snot nearly reached his eyebrows. "I'll atone! Send me to prison—just let me live!"

"Then answer my questions." Her voice cut like steel.

"Anything!"

Evangeline's eyes glinted. "As Seraphina's lover, tell me—has she ever borne a child?"
###Chapter 139

Lucas Kingsley's gaze bore into Isabella Sinclair, his dark eyes unreadable.

His sister had always been exceptional at turning the tides. Rules meant nothing to her—she bent them, broke them, rewrote them when necessary.

Give her the slightest opening, and she'd flip the game entirely, leaving her enemies scrambling.

Nathan Prescott's expression twisted. He hadn't anticipated Isabella's question.

"Judging by your reaction," she said coolly, lips curling, "you know exactly what I'm talking about."

Nathan swallowed hard, stumbling over his words. "I—I do. Because... the child is mine."

The Sinclair siblings froze.

Isabella's fingers tightened in quiet triumph. This storm had just handed her a weapon.

"Explain," Lucas demanded, voice like ice.

"I was a personal trainer at an elite gym overseas. That's where I met Victoria. She was... persuasive. Things happened."

Isabella arched a brow. "Go on."

"It was never serious. Victoria had plenty of men. I was just another one. One night, we got high, got reckless. She took the morning-after pill, but..." He shrugged. "Sometimes they fail. She found out she was pregnant."

Isabella blinked. So, Victoria dabbled in drugs. Interesting.

"Knowing her, she wouldn't keep it. Why did she?"

"She claimed her health was too fragile. Said if she aborted, she'd never conceive again. No wealthy family would accept a barren daughter-in-law, so she had to carry it."

Nathan sneered. "Funny, considering how wild she was in bed. Didn't seem fragile then."

Isabella's jaw twitched, but she kept her composure. "Where's the child now?"

"Some orphanage overseas. A girl, two or three years old. That's all I know."

He wasn't lying—just disgustingly indifferent. He'd never bothered to see his own daughter.

"People like you shouldn't be allowed to breed," Lucas snarled. "You discard a child like trash?"

"I didn't—! Victoria's mother kept tabs on her. The baby was taken right after birth. That woman knows where she is!"

Isabella's eyes gleamed. A plan formed instantly.

She glanced at Lucas.

No words were needed. They understood each other perfectly.

The basement door creaked open. A guard strode in, holding Nathan's phone.

"Miss Sinclair, you have a call."

She took it, scanning the screen. "Nathan. Who is it?"

Nathan paled. "Victoria."

"Answer it. Talk normally. One wrong move..." Her smile was lethal.

He nodded frantically.

The call connected. "Victoria. Miss me already?"

"Cut the crap." A pause. Then, low and sharp: "You haven't done anything stupid, have you? I told you to wait for my orders."

Nathan forced a laugh. "Of course not. I wouldn't dare."

Isabella smirked.

So, Nathan had acted alone. Desperate for money, he'd tried to eliminate her without Victoria's approval.

Pathetic.

"Don't touch Isabella yet. Wait for my signal."

Victoria's voice dripped with smugness. "Things are falling into place. Alexander trusts me again. He's been by my side for days. His father approved our marriage. The engagement will happen soon."

Engagement?

Lucas frowned, watching his sister.

But Isabella merely yawned.

Seeing her indifference, Lucas relaxed.

"Since you're securing Alexander," Nathan pressed, "what about my money?"

"Impatient much?" Victoria scoffed. "I'll transfer 50K now. The rest after the engagement."

"And Isabella?"

"Make her suffer."

Victoria's voice turned venomous. "She ruined my life. I want hers destroyed. If you can't cripple her, at least scar that pretty face."

The call ended.

Nathan trembled.

Isabella? Unfazed.

"You did well. Rest now."

Her phone buzzed—Daniel Carter calling.

She turned away, leaving the basement.

The moment she left, the air shifted.

Nathan's breath hitched as Lucas approached.

The nobleman's silver cross swung from his lapel, glinting like a blade.

Lucas didn't touch him. Yet Nathan felt death breathing down his neck.

"You hurt my sister," Lucas murmured, eyes burning with quiet fury.

Then—

A flash of silver.

A scream tore through the basement.

Lucas had severed Nathan's hand with the cross.

Outside, Daniel stood in the cold, face pale.

"Daniel?" Isabella hurried over. "You shouldn't be here."

His eyes were red-rimmed. Voice shaking, he whispered, "I'm sorry."
###Chapter 140

"Jason, what's wrong with you?" Evadne's brows furrowed in confusion.

She had always held Jason in high regard, but now he stood before her, disheveled and broken—eyes bloodshot, lips colorless, like a stray puppy caught in a storm.

"Jason, is this about Elspeth?"

Ca**ius approached Evadne, his steps measured, his expression serene as he wiped his elegant hands with a crisp white silk handkerchief.

Evadne glanced at him and noticed faint traces of blood on the fabric.

"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!" Jason kept bowing, his voice thick with remorse.

Just as Evadne was about to question him further, her phone buzzed—Arnold was calling.

"Arnold?"

"Sis, Elspeth just walked out of my office."

His voice was heavy with frustration. "My team and I spent weeks gathering evidence against her for abuse of power and bribery, but she was two steps ahead. She shifted all the blame onto Earl. Frederic hired her a shark of a lawyer—Cedric Dempsey. That man knows every legal loophole in the book. My case wasn't strong enough, so I had to release her."

"It's fine, Arnold. You did your best. We achieved our main goal—securing the Westguard project. The rest can wait."

Evadne remained composed, but those around her seethed with anger, itching to tear Elspeth apart.

Elspeth was far from innocent, but Evadne knew patience was key.

At this point, Frederic was still blindly devoted to Elspeth. He would move mountains to protect her. Dragging two corporate giants into a petty feud over a single project wasn't worth the resources.

"Evadne, Jason called me earlier. He sounded devastated. Comfort him, will you? This isn't his fault. He cares too much about what you think—it's eating him alive." Arnold sighed.

"Understood."

After hanging up, Evadne finally pieced everything together. Her gaze softened as she looked at Jason. "Jason."

"Ms. Evadne, this is my family's disgrace. I'll take full responsibility." His voice cracked, his eyes red with shame.

He had stormed into Cedric's law firm earlier that day after learning his brother had taken Elspeth's case. The argument that followed was explosive.

"Our father was an honorable man—upright, selfless. He made enemies in his career, and the moment he retired, they circled like vultures, waiting to strike. If not for Chairman Emeric stepping in, offering him a position as legal advisor, shielding our family—where would we be? How could your firm have flourished like this? And now, with you defending the Abernathy group, making excuses for Elspeth—how is this not betrayal?"

Jason had never fought with his brother before. But for Evadne, he was ready to burn bridges.

"The Ashbournes have been good to us, but that doesn’t mean we owe them blind loyalty! Dad has won countless cases for Chairman Emeric—any debt has been repaid tenfold! I’m a lawyer first. To me, every client is equal. If the terms are right, I’ll take the case—whether it’s Abernathy or Ashbourne, it doesn’t matter! But you—our parents poured everything into you, gave you the best education, so you could achieve greatness! Not so you could grovel at Ms. Evadne’s feet!"

Cedric’s words had cut deep.

Jason had given Evadne his heart, but his family was pulling him back.

He couldn’t face her.

"Jason, what nonsense are you spouting?"

Evadne chuckled softly, like she was soothing a child. She placed her hands on his trembling shoulders and gave him a gentle shake. "Don’t blame yourself, and don’t fight with your family over this. Elspeth is nothing. How could she possibly come between us?"

"Ms. Evadne..." His voice was thick with guilt.

"If Cedric took Elspeth’s case, I understand completely. I hold no grudge."

Her tone was firm, sincere. "A lawyer’s duty is to their client, not personal ties. If Abernathy offered him fair terms, then he made the right professional choice. If Ashbourne ever needs legal counsel, I’m sure he’d represent us just as fiercely, wouldn’t he?"

Jason lowered his head, nodding slightly.

Once they were in the car, Ca**ius took Evadne’s hand, tracing slow circles on her palm. "So, what’s next?"

"Find Acacia and George’s illegitimate child. But first, I need to draw my enemies out."

Her eyes gleamed with cunning. "George said only Acacia’s mother, Una, knows where the child is. So, let’s make Una lead us right to them."

Ca**ius smirked. "And Acacia?"

"Break her before I destroy her."

Evadne stretched lazily, stifling a yawn. "Isn’t she about to get engaged to Thaddeus? The higher she climbs, the harder she’ll fall."

"Evadne, Thaddeus has truly lost his mind," Ca**ius muttered, still shaken by George’s revelations.

"Ah, he’s been blind for a while now. No matter—I’ve found myself again, and I want that worthless man out of my life as soon as possible."

Suddenly, she remembered something. Pulling out her phone, she showed Ca**ius the photo she’d taken of Avery. "Do you recognize him? He saved me from George’s knife. If not for him, I’d have more than just a scratch."

Ca**ius studied the image, then his eyes widened in surprise. "You really don’t know who this is?"

"Should I?"

"You two were close as children."

"What?!" Evadne stared at the photo, puzzled.

The face was familiar, but she couldn’t place it.

"That’s Jeff Chambers’ youngest son, Avery. He was quiet as a kid—only ever talked to you. You really don’t remember?"

"Little Critter?!" Evadne gasped. "When did he get so tall?!"

——

Late that night, Avery’s private club was alive with energy.

Under dim, pulsing lights, guests drank and danced like there was no tomorrow.

Only Avery remained seated in a shadowed corner, untouched by the chaos around him.

No woman dared approach him. Everyone knew—Mr. Avery was untouchable.

"Mr. Avery, I might have to skip the yacht party."

A tipsy young man slumped beside him, scowling. "My father’s forcing me on a blind date. Who gets married in their twenties? Only Thaddeus—always dreaming of domestic bliss."

Avery sipped his wine. "If you don’t want to go, cancel."

"I can’t!" The man groaned. "It’s Emeric’s daughter—Evadne Ashbourne!"

Avery’s fingers tightened around his glass.

"I have an idea," he said smoothly.

"What?"

Avery finished his drink, his sharp features half-hidden in the dim light.

"You go to the yacht party. I’ll take the blind date."
###Chapter 141

After seven grueling days, Isabella finally emerged from the prosecutor's office, her designer dress wrinkled beyond recognition and her signature perfume replaced by the stench of stale coffee and sweat.

Her flawless makeup had melted away, revealing dark circles that aged her ten years overnight. Streaks of silver peeked through her usually perfectly dyed chestnut locks.

She avoided the paparazzi like the plague. The thought of Nathaniel seeing her in this state made her blood run cold. Twenty-five years of carefully crafted perfection couldn't unravel in one unguarded moment.

Olivia whisked her to an exclusive spa under the radar. A steaming shower, fresh couture, meticulous hair coloring, and subtle makeup later, the polished socialite reemerged.

"You should visit Arabella before facing Father." Olivia adjusted her mother's diamond earrings. "She's family, after all. That suicide stunt deserves our...concern."

Isabella smirked while reapplying her signature red lipstick. "Of course, darling. Your father expects nothing less than compassion from me."

Olivia shuddered. "She actually slit her wrists! The bathroom looked like a crime scene."

"Please." Isabella snapped her compact shut. "She had staff checking every fifteen minutes. That girl wouldn't risk chipping a nail for real."

Olivia gasped. "You orchestrated this?"

Isabella pressed a manicured finger to her lips. The same calculated "suicide attempt" had secured her place in the Vanderbilt dynasty decades ago.

And Thaddeus' history with depression? Perfect leverage. Make him relive his darkest days, and he'd come crawling back to Arabella, his savior.

"Better Arabella than that Ashbourne witch," Isabella hissed, her Botox-stiff face twisting with rage. Those interrogation rooms had stripped her bare - all Evadne's doing.

"We'll make her pay," Olivia vowed. "The Ashbournes might rule Skyrim, but Emsworth bows to the Vanderbilts."

At the hospital, hearing Nathaniel and Thaddeus were present, Isabella transformed. Tears welled on command as she flung open the door.

"Arabella! My precious girl!" She crushed the startled patient in a dramatic embrace, sobbing loudly enough for the hallway to hear. "Why must fate punish our family so cruelly?"

Arabella caught on instantly, wailing like a banshee. Their histrionics turned the private room into a Greek tragedy.

Thaddeus stood motionless by the window, his expression glacial. Arabella's stomach dropped. Where was the man who once wiped her tears? The warmth in his eyes had vanished, stolen by Evadne's spell.

Nathaniel's voice cut through the theatrics. "Isabella. Thaddeus. Conference room. Now."

In the sterile meeting space, Isabella dabbed fake tears. "I thought I'd never see you again, Nathaniel. Those interrogators...they treated me like a common criminal!"

Nathaniel's jaw tightened at her憔悴 appearance, but the mountain of crises left no room for comfort.

The wall TV flickered to life, broadcasting Cassius Kingsley shaking hands with Westguard executives. Thaddeus' grip shattered his coffee cup, dark liquid spreading like blood across the table.

Nathaniel's face turned to stone. Their stolen project, now Evadne's triumph.

Isabella seized the moment. "Evadne destroys our family, steals our business, and tries to imprison me! After all we've done for her!" Her voice cracked artfully. "Three years we treated her like daughter!"

Thaddeus' laugh was arctic. "Is treating someone 'like daughter' forcing them to cook your meals, Isabella?"

"She volunteered!" Isabella's veneer slipped. "No one held a gun to her head!"

Nathaniel finally spoke, his words detonating like grenades. "Effective immediately, Thaddeus assumes presidency and vice-chairmanship."

Isabella's perfect complexion blanched. "What? Why?"

Thaddeus answered for his silent father. "A CEO under criminal investigation? The board won't risk that scandal. We'd be laughingstocks."

"Evadne framed me!" Isabella shrieked, vision blurring with panic. "Earl confessed! It's his crime!"

Thaddeus left without another word, his dismissal more crushing than any insult.

Isabella clutched Nathaniel's arm, her nails drawing blood through his suit. "You promised me that position! Twenty-five years I've waited!"

Nathaniel peeled her off with terrifying calm. "The board decides, not me. And Isabella..." His gaze pierced her soul. "Are you truly innocent?"

Her mask shattered. That look - he knew. He knew everything.

Twenty-five years of scheming, wasted. The throne she'd killed for, now forever out of reach.
###Chapter 142

The sterile hospital room was quiet except for the steady beeping of machines. Isabella sat by the bed, gently stroking Arabella's hair as she spoke in hushed tones.

"Sebastian pulled every string and spent a fortune to get Dominic to help Seraphina evade the prosecutors. It's obvious how much he cares about her. With her influence, your marriage to Nathaniel is practically guaranteed! And let's not forget—he’s been visiting you every single day. The way he talks to you now? So much warmer. Your relationship has clearly improved!"

Isabella couldn’t hide her smug smile. She was already picturing herself as Nathaniel’s mother-in-law.

"You know Nathaniel better than I do. If he was truly done with you, why would he even bother coming to the hospital?"

Arabella bit her lip, her fingers twisting the edge of the blanket. "I know it sounds logical, but after everything that’s happened, I can’t shake this unease."

The memory of Nathaniel’s icy glare sent a shudder down her spine. "Even though he’s been here, taking care of me, something feels... different. The way he looks at me—it’s not the same."

"Stop overthinking it," Isabella chided.

The door creaked open, and Nathaniel strode in.

Arabella immediately slumped against the pillows, her eyes welling up with practiced tears. "Nathaniel..."

She reached for him as he approached, but he stopped just out of reach.

Her hand hovered awkwardly in the air, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment.

"I have to head back to the office. I’ll see you tonight." His voice was smooth, his expression unreadable.

"Nathaniel, I’m so sorry." Tears spilled down her cheeks as she put on her most pitiful expression. "I’ve caused you so much trouble. This is all my fault."

"Just rest."

Without another word, he turned and left.

Arabella clenched the sheets, frustration bubbling inside her. The Nathaniel who once doted on her was gone. Now, his cold detachment terrified her.

She shot Isabella a desperate look.

Isabella nodded and hurried after him.

"Mr. Kingsley!"

Nathaniel paused, his gaze sharp as he turned. "What?"

"You’ve seen Arabella’s condition. She’s barely holding it together. She suffered so much abroad, and all she wanted was to come back to you. If you abandon her now—"

"I’ll take responsibility for her illness. She did save my life once."

Then he walked away, leaving Isabella frozen in the hallway, a chill creeping down her spine.

Meanwhile, at The Regal Palace, Seraphina was buried in work, overseeing every detail of Victoria’s wedding.

In the middle of a heated discussion with her team, her phone buzzed.

"Sebastian, I’m busy. What is it?" She wedged the phone between her ear and shoulder, flipping through contracts.

Sebastian?

The room fell silent.

That was their untouchable CEO.

"It’s time." His voice was low, cryptic.

"What?"

"It’s time for your blind date!"

Seraphina yanked the phone away as Sebastian’s booming voice echoed through the room.

Every head snapped toward her, eyes wide.

Their fierce, brilliant President Ashbourne—being forced on a blind date?

"Sebastian, I’m in a meeting. We’ll discuss this nonsense later."

"Nonsense? You think your future is nonsense?" His tone hardened. "Let me ask you this—do you want to be CEO of Sinclair Holdings, or not?"

Seraphina gritted her teeth. Sebastian, you manipulative snake. Did Nathaniel teach you this?

"Fine. I’ll go. But not today. I have meetings."

"You can’t run forever."

The rest of the meeting passed in tense silence.

Back in her office, Seraphina collapsed onto the couch, exhausted.

Lawrence entered with coffee. "Ms. Ashbourne, is everything alright?"

"That traitor," she muttered, punching a cushion. "I clean up his messes, secure deals, and now he throws a blind date at me? Maybe I should join the FBI and disappear."

Lawrence chuckled. "You’re too loyal for that. The chairman’s stepping back—he needs you. And Sinclair Holdings can’t expand without you."

Seraphina sighed, kicking off her heels.

Lawrence draped a blanket over her legs, tucking it gently around her.

"You’re right. I’ll handle it." She smirked. "Sebastian has his games, but I have mine."

She marched to her desk, barefoot, and scribbled a list.

Lawrence took it, scanning the items before bursting into laughter.

"You’re evil."

Seraphina grinned. "Just making sure this blind date is... memorable."
###Chapter 143

Emeric had scheduled an entire day of blind dates for Evadne.

As she applied the finishing touches to her outrageous makeup in the bathroom, Jason stood outside, scrolling through the day's itinerary on his tablet.

"11:30 AM—lunch with Mr. Zachary from the H Group."

"1:30 PM—afternoon tea with the eldest son of President Wilson."

"3:30 PM—a musical with the second son of President Liam from the Z Group."

It was like a speed-dating marathon, one suitor after another.

The bathroom door finally swung open.

Evadne emerged, her transformation complete. Jason took one look at her and burst into laughter.

"Ms. Evadne, you've truly outdone yourself this time!"

She had on a ridiculous wig, her face covered in fake freckles, a thick mustache glued above her lip, and she was dramatically pinching her nose while leaning against the doorframe. It was as if she were playing a character from some absurd comedy—but there was a method to her madness.

"You think this is over the top? I was considering adding a few fake scars for extra effect."

She grinned, revealing blackened teeth, and waved Jason over. "Come on, join the fun!"

Even the usually composed Jason couldn't help but double over with laughter.

Ms. Evadne was, as always, utterly unpredictable.

Not satisfied with just Jason's reaction, she snapped a selfie and posted it in the group chat with her brothers.

The chat exploded instantly.

Cassius: [Who the hell is that?]

Evadne teased back: (Take a guess.)

Elvis: [LMAO, you're killing me!]

Arnold: [Good God, you look terrifying! Did you have to pick that character?]

The banter escalated, the brothers playfully roasting each other.

Evadne typed: [What do you think my chances are of landing a successful blind date looking like this?]

Arnold: [Zero.]

Cassius, ever the optimist: (Anyone who gets to know you would be charmed. Good looks are common—interesting people are rare. Someone will fall for you.)

Elvis chimed in: [I’d still like you even if you were ugly. You’ve got killer legs!]

Arnold shot back: [As a prosecutor, aren’t you supposed to not judge by appearances?]

Elvis: [Shut up!]

Evadne scrolled through the messages, laughing so hard her stomach hurt.

She typed one last message: [Wish me luck. First blind date incoming.]

Cassius: [God bless you—and especially your date.]

Arnold: [Evadne, if some rich guy actually likes you like this, maybe his feelings are genuine.]

Arnold added: [He might see past the exterior, like we do.]

Evadne chuckled and replied: (If anyone actually falls for me today, I’ll personally escort them to Ashbourne Hospital for an eye exam.)

At the same time, Jason’s phone buzzed.

While Evadne wasn’t looking, he checked it—her four brothers had all messaged him at once.

The messages were nearly identical.

[Keep an eye on Evadne. Let us know if anything happens.]

Jason reassured them: [Don’t worry. I’ll make sure she stays out of trouble.]

The brothers replied in unison: [We’re not worried about her. We’re worried about the poor guy she’s meeting!]

Jason rolled his eyes.

And so, the blind date gauntlet began.

Evadne was nothing if not efficient. If she had to endure this, she’d meet them all in one day and get it over with.

What she didn’t expect was that, despite her deliberately off-putting appearance, these wealthy heirs and noblemen remained unfazed. They carried on conversations with eerie calm.

Was her personality that magnetic? Or were these men just that desperate to align themselves with the Ashbourne name?

Power was a frightening thing—it made people tolerate the intolerable.

Thankfully, she had backup plans.

The first guy? She casually mentioned during lunch that his kidney function was on par with a 70-year-old’s—might affect his ability to have kids. He bolted.

The second? She kept staring at an empty space behind him.

"Ms. Evadne, what are you looking at?"

"Mr. Neil, there’s a child standing right behind you. Don’t you want to invite him to join us?"

Her voice dropped ominously. "He looks so lonely."

The man left in record time.

The third date was at a musical, so interaction was minimal. Surprisingly peaceful.

Afterward, Mr. Lance politely asked her to dinner.

"Ms. Evadne, I had a wonderful time. Would you join me for dinner?"

"Absolutely," she said sweetly, picking up her bag.

Only then did he notice the bold lettering on it: Psychiatric Center of Skyrim.

"Mr. Lance, why did you stop?" she asked innocently, blinking.

He paled. "Ah—just remembered a meeting! Rain check!"

And just like that, the final date of the day arrived.

The location was a quiet, elegant café, the air rich with the scent of coffee. It reminded her of Silverlake Harbor—an unintentionally perfect choice.

Maybe she’d go easy on this one.

After a day of terrorizing wealthy heirs, even Jason was impressed.

"Miss, you’ve certainly scared them off," he said, though he looked concerned. "But what if they start spreading rumors? It could damage your reputation in Elmsworth."

"Let them talk," Evadne said coolly, adding another fake freckle. "I want everyone to think the Ashbourne heiress is insane. Maybe then Emeric will stop setting me up."

Jason didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

"Jason," she sighed, packing up her makeup, "if someone actually fell for me like this, I wouldn’t even be mad. I just want someone to love me for me. So I don’t have to do this anymore."

Jason’s heart ached for her.

He wished for nothing more.

"Emeric’s cunning," she mused. "I dodged this round, but who knows what he’ll try next."

"The chairman adores you," Jason said gently. "He always says you’re the most like him."

"Are you implying that’s an insult?" she shot back.

Jason laughed—just as his phone buzzed.

"Miss, your final date has arrived."

"I know."

Jason stepped out to give them privacy.

Evadne waited, propping her chin on her hand, gazing out at the serene view. She closed her eyes, soaking in the café’s peaceful atmosphere.

Then—the door opened.

Steady footsteps approached.

A faint, intoxicating scent drifted toward her—like a midnight breeze carrying the rare fragrance of violets, subtle yet unforgettable.

Evadne was allergic to smoke but had a sharp nose for perfumes.

She opened her eyes and looked up.

Her breath caught.

Before she could speak, a smooth voice broke the silence.

"Apologies for keeping you waiting, Miss Evadne."
###Chapter 144

"You?" Isabella gasped, her eyes widening in shock.

The woman before him was a mess—freckles dusting her nose, hair tousled in deliberate disarray. Yet there was something endearing about her disheveled charm.

Nathaniel's lips curved into a smirk, his golden-rimmed glasses catching the light. "Surprised your blind date is me?"

Isabella pressed her lips together, momentarily speechless.

The question was blunt.

But the playful glint in his gaze softened the tension, making it feel like nothing more than a harmless tease.

"Mind if I sit?" Nathaniel asked, ever the gentleman.

"Go ahead," she replied coolly.

The man who had appeared before her that day was just as she remembered—dressed in a tailored navy suit, exuding effortless sophistication.

"That getup suits you," Nathaniel mused, tilting his head. "But you don’t need to put on an act for me. Be yourself."

Isabella coughed, cheeks flushing. "I thought my blind date was someone else. Why are you here?"

"Because I knew you’d want to see me again." He adjusted his glasses, his smile easy. "And I wanted to see you too."

His words carried weight, hinting at something deeper.

"True," she admitted, her gaze sharpening. "Ever since we first met, I’ve been curious about who you really are."

Nathaniel’s fingers twitched slightly against his knees. His voice was soft, almost reverent. "Isabella. It’s been a long time."

She blinked, caught off guard. "Yeah… long time no see."

Their childhood together was a distant memory—over a decade ago.

Back then, Nathaniel had been small, shy, with delicate features that made him an easy target. Isabella, the fearless ringleader of their school, had stepped in when others bullied him. She’d even taken down three older boys who’d dared to pick on him.

She barely remembered those days.

But he had never forgotten.

To him, she had been sunlight—bright, untouchable, burning fiercely.

"So that night at the bar, when I bumped into you drunk… you already knew who I was."

"Yes," he admitted.

"And when I was in trouble, you weren’t just passing by. You were following me."

"Guilty."

"Why?" Her brows furrowed. "If you recognized me, why not just tell me?"

"Because I was waiting." His voice roughened slightly. "Waiting for you to remember me on your own."

A pang of guilt twisted in her chest. Had she really forgotten him so completely?

"Did you pick this place?"

"Yes." His eyes gleamed. "I thought you’d like it. Reminds me of Silvercrest Bay."

A flicker of nostalgia crossed her face. "You remember that?"

"Of course." He took a slow sip of coffee, every movement refined. "We used to play hide-and-seek in your garden. You always hid behind the rockery."

She groaned, covering her face. "Oh god, you remember everything?"

He chuckled, the sound warm.

They talked for a while.

She learned he’d spent years in Helgen caring for his mother, who suffered from Alzheimer’s. He’d built his own empire there, turning down countless chances to return—until now.

Isabella vaguely recalled the complicated dynamics of the Kingsley family. Four siblings, half-siblings, stepmothers—messy even by elite standards.

"Why come back now?" she asked.

His fingers traced the rim of his cup. "Because it’s time to claim what’s mine."

She nodded. In their world, if you didn’t fight, you were left with nothing.

"Dinner’s still a while off," Nathaniel said suddenly. "What should we do?"

"Huh?"

His smile turned conspiratorial. "Let me show you the roses at sunset."

Her breath hitched.

Roses.

Her favorite.

She had a garden full of them back at Silvercrest.

"Alright," she agreed instantly. "Let’s go."

In the car, Nathaniel stole glances at her.

Without her disguise, she was radiant—no makeup, hair loosely pinned up, effortlessly stunning.

"Do you remember what you called me when we first met?" he asked softly.

She frowned. "No…?"

"Little Critter."

Isabella groaned. "Oh my god."

He laughed. "You heard my father scold me with it once and never let it go."

"I was a child," she protested, cheeks burning. "I’m so sorry."

"You can still call me that if you want."

She swatted the air. "Absolutely not. You’re Nathaniel Kingsley now. That’s disrespectful."

His smile turned tender as he leaned closer.

"Alright," he murmured. "Whatever you say."
###Chapter 145

If it hadn't been for Isabella dragging her along, Seraphina would never have discovered this vast rose garden hidden in Elmsworth's Southern Suburbs.

This was Isabella's private sanctuary, separate from the Sinclair Holdings. Acres upon acres of land, all blooming with Damask roses.

Beneath the golden sunset, the garden was breathtaking. The vibrant pink roses against emerald leaves were a feast for the eyes, instantly lifting the spirits. Seraphina was mesmerized, unable to look away.

Young couples strolled hand in hand, snapping selfies, while influencers livestreamed the picturesque scenery. The lively atmosphere eased the tension Seraphina had carried from work.

With their striking looks, they drew admiring glances from every direction.

To any onlooker, they appeared to be the perfect match.

Seraphina bent down, fingertips brushing the delicate petals of a rose. She inhaled deeply, her nose wrinkling playfully as the sweet fragrance enveloped her. Pure delight lit up her face.

Isabella watched her with tender amusement. "Ms. Seraphina, you outshine every rose here."

She laughed, tossing her hair. "I know I'm stunning, but I appreciate the compliment."

He stepped closer, hope flickering in his gaze. "Can I call you Seraphina, like when we were kids? And you can call me Izzy, just like before?"

Discomfort prickled through her. Her feelings for him had shifted since childhood. While his affection seemed unchanged, to her, he was now a stranger.

After a pause, she replied gently, "Maybe once we get reacquainted, I'll call you that again."

His eyes brightened. "I believe we can be as close as we once were. I'll wait for that day."

Eager to shift the subject, Seraphina gestured to the fields. "Isabella, what's the annual yield here? What are the cultivation costs? Have any companies secured exclusive contracts with you?"

A knowing smile curved his lips. "Ms. Seraphina, are you proposing a partnership?"

"Absolutely," she said without hesitation.

From the moment she stepped into the garden, business possibilities had ignited in her mind. Since returning to Sinclair Holdings, she'd been strategizing an expansion into the female market—rose-infused cosmetics and skincare. Time constraints had delayed the project, but this garden reignited her ambition.

"Damask roses symbolize love and beauty," she explained, her eyes alight with passion. "Their oil is precious, beneficial for both body and mind. Importing it is costly, and domestic growers are rare. With this resource, we could form a powerful alliance. You supply the roses; I'll transform them into luxury products. Together, we can turn this garden into more than just a tourist attraction. We can create a brand women adore, with profits beyond measure."

Isabella studied her intently, a slow smile spreading across his handsome face.

Truthfully, he barely registered her business pitch. Over the years, countless investors had shown interest in his roses, but he'd dismissed them all.

This sea of flowers? It existed for one reason only—to lure her here.

When he remained silent, Seraphina assumed he was considering her proposal. "I know it's sudden," she said with a light laugh. "It's a massive project, so take your time to think it over. No rush."

Outside the manor, Nathaniel stood in the fading sunlight, gazing at the blooming roses with a troubled heart.

He knew the Sinclairs and the Lockwoods were close. Mr. Reginald and Chairman William were like brothers. Isabella's feelings for Seraphina were obvious.

Normally, Seraphina was ice-cold toward men—just look at how she treated Dominic. Brutal.

But with Isabella? She wasn't nearly as distant. She even seemed willing to spend more time with him.

Sure, his past heroics played a role, but Nathaniel sensed something more.

Was it possible...?

He sighed heavily.

Just then, three sleek luxury cars approached.

A Maybach led the procession, its license plate sending a chill down Nathaniel's spine.

The Abernathy Group. Alexander's car.

The vehicle stopped. Gordon exited first, then respectfully opened the door for Alexander.

Cool as ever, Alexander adjusted his suit cuffs and stepped out in pristine handmade shoes.

"Fantastic," Nathaniel muttered under his breath.

A slender hand extended from the car.

"Alex, could you help me?"

Alexander hesitated, then offered his hand.

Adriana seized it eagerly, as if afraid he'd withdraw it. Her face glowed with triumph.

Even with Alexander's expression as frosty as ever, she was certain she could win him back.

Watching the pair walk toward the manor hand in hand, Nathaniel barely suppressed a scoff.

"Alex, I only came because I wanted to see the flowers. Am I bothering you?"

Adriana's eyes shimmered with unshed tears, her grip tightening. "Maybe I should go back. I don't want to be a burden."

In truth, Alexander hadn't come to admire roses. He was here for a business inspection.

This estate boasted the largest Damask rose fields in Elmsworth—perhaps the entire state. He'd brought botany experts to assess the soil and flower quality. If all met standards, he'd negotiate a supply deal for Abernathy's upcoming skincare line.

But Adriana had somehow learned of his plans and insisted on joining.

Given her recent instability—suicidal tendencies and severe depression—her therapist had recommended outdoor exposure. Reluctantly, Alexander had agreed.

"It's fine," he said flatly. "The doctor said nature would help."

"Alex, thank you." Her voice trembled. "You still care about me." She leaned into him.

Alexander stiffened, his jaw tightening with visible distaste.

"Mr. Abernathy!" Gordon whispered urgently. "Isn't that Ms. Seraphina's secretary?"

Alexander's head snapped up. His pulse spiked.

Where Nathaniel was, Seraphina couldn't be far.

Was she here? To see the flowers?

He immediately dismissed the thought.

No. That woman didn't do anything without a purpose.

She was here for the business.
###Chapter 146

The air crackled with tension as Nathaniel and Dominic stood inches apart, their gazes locked in a silent battle.

"Isn't this unexpected, Mr. Dominic? Or should I say, unfortunate?" Nathaniel's voice dripped with venom.

"Is Arabella here?" Dominic's brow furrowed, his tone sharp.

At the mention of her name, Seraphina's pulse quickened.

"What? Is she forbidden from being here?"

Nathaniel smirked, his words laced with mockery. "Mr. Dominic, you don’t own this place."

"Wow, Dominic was just asking. No need to be so defensive, Nathaniel!" Preston snapped.

"Just asking? Since when do you have the right?" Nathaniel's expression twisted with contempt.

"What did you just say?"

"Enough, Preston." Dominic silenced him, then pressed, "Why is Arabella here?"

Nathaniel shot Seraphina a cold glance before answering with a sneer, "Mr. Dominic, Ms. Arabella’s reason for being here is the same as yours."

Dominic’s expression darkened further.

He had suspected Arabella was interested in the rose field, but this time, he wouldn’t let her win.

Meanwhile, Arabella had already hiked up her skirt and stepped into the rose bushes, moving with effortless grace.

She knelt on the damp earth without hesitation, her delicate fingers sifting through the soil. She examined the rose stems and petals, snapping photos and jotting meticulous notes on her phone.

Other women came for the scenery and photos.

Not Arabella. She was here for business.

Who would’ve guessed such a stunning woman could be so pragmatic? All she cared about was profit.

Ambitious women had a way of drawing people in.

Sebastian stood nearby, watching her with quiet patience.

A faint smile touched his lips, his affection unmistakable. "You haven’t changed since we were kids. I like that."

His phone buzzed, snapping him out of his thoughts.

Sebastian frowned as he answered. "What is it?"

"Mr. Lockwood, Dominic is here."

His secretary lowered her voice. "Earlier, the Vanderbilt Group reached out about collaborating on the Rose Manor project. I didn’t give them a definitive answer, as you instructed. But they’ve already brought a survey team. They’re serious about this."

Sebastian glanced at Arabella, who was still absorbed in her work. "Who else is with them?"

"Dominic’s rumored fiancée. Bringing her to something like this—they must be close." His secretary’s tone was laced with disdain.

And Arabella had no idea.

Was this the man she had once loved?

The man she had sacrificed everything for, staying by his side for three years?

Arabella was a fool.

Sebastian’s chest burned with anger. "Did you prepare what I asked for?"

"Everything’s ready, Mr. Lockwood!"

"Bring it. And send someone to guide the Vanderbilt Group here." Sebastian adjusted his glasses, a cold glint in his eyes.

Arabella had been crouching for too long, and her back ached. She rose slowly from the roses, brushing dirt from her hands as she caught her breath.

That was just like her—completely absorbed in her work, oblivious to time.

She suddenly remembered Sebastian was still waiting.

When she turned, he was standing exactly where she’d left him, holding a basket of exquisite pink roses.

"Ms. Arabella," he called, stepping toward her.

"Don’t come closer! You’ll ruin your clothes!" She gestured for him to stop, eyeing his pristine attire.

But he ignored her, striding through the thorns without hesitation.

Arabella bit her lip, embarrassed.

"These are for you." Sebastian’s deep eyes softened as he offered the basket.

"Sebastian, I can’t accept these." She smiled but shook her head.

Flowers, especially roses, carried implications. It wouldn’t be appropriate.

Anticipating her refusal, he quickly added, "Flowers suit you. But more importantly, I noticed your interest in these roses. Take them home, study them. The soil from this field is at the bottom—transplant them, and they’ll bloom year-round."

She hesitated, then finally took the basket. "Thank you."

Suddenly, Sebastian leaned in, his face inches from hers.

Arabella blinked in surprise. "Is there something on my face?"

He nodded seriously.

"Where?" She rubbed her cheek, only smearing more dirt.

Now her face was a mess.

Sebastian chuckled, pulling out a handkerchief. Gently, he wiped the dirt from her cheek and forehead.

By the time she realized what was happening, he was already done. "I could’ve done that myself."

"Too late. You’re clean now." He stepped back, his gaze lingering before he looked away.

He always did this—retreating just as things felt too intimate.

For a moment, Arabella wondered if he was being too kind.

But she dismissed the thought. Maybe he was just naturally considerate. Or maybe it was because they’d known each other since childhood.

Then, footsteps approached.

Arabella turned—and froze.

Dominic stood just steps away, his expression unreadable. His eyes, calm as still water, watched them.

But beneath that calm was a storm.

Dominic had seen everything—the roses, her smile, Sebastian’s touch.

Their ease with each other was infuriating.

His fists clenched, veins throbbing at his temples.

He’d rather she came to fight him. He’d rather give her everything.

But watching her give what was once his to another man?

That, he couldn’t bear.
###Chapter 147

Thaddeus's mind was a tempest, his brooding expression barely concealing the storm within.

Evadne, however, was far less complicated. She was simply annoyed.

What rotten luck!

Running into this insufferable man in such a picturesque setting was like finding a diamond in a trash heap—completely ruining the aesthetic. Next time, she'd consult her horoscope before stepping out.

As for Acacia, the woman clinging to Thaddeus's arm, one glance at her made Evadne's eyes ache.

Just then, Avery leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. "Relax," he murmured, a hint of amusement in his voice. "I've got your back."

Evadne blinked. What was he playing at?

"Ms. Evadne, what a coincidence," Acacia cooed, her usual sharpness replaced with saccharine sweetness. "Is this gentleman your new beau? You two make such a striking pair."

Evadne's expression remained impassive. She had zero interest in entertaining this act.

Avery, however, answered with a smirk. "Flattering, but not quite accurate—yet."

Evadne stiffened.

Thaddeus's fist clenched, his face darkening.

Not yet?

Did that mean he was planning to become Evadne's boyfriend? Was this a taunt? A challenge? Or were they already involved in a way he couldn't stomach?

Acacia noticed Thaddeus's tension, his muscles rigid beneath her grip. It was clear—he still hadn't moved on.

But Evadne had a new suitor now. That eased Acacia's worries.

Someone had to let go of their failed marriage.

Evadne was clearly a magnet for wealthy men. Who was this new one?

He carried himself with effortless elegance, his looks undeniably striking.

"Mr. Thaddeus, here to admire the roses with your fiancée?" Avery's tone was light, almost mocking. "You might want to hurry. Rose Manor closes soon."

"I don't indulge in such trivialities," Thaddeus shot back, deliberately ignoring Evadne. "Gordon, contact the owner of Rose Manor. I want to discuss a deal."

Gordon scrambled for his phone.

Seconds later, a ringtone pierced the air—close. Too close.

"Odd," Gordon muttered, scanning the area. "Sounds like it's right here."

The ringing grew louder.

"Mr. Chambers."

Thaddeus froze as a man approached Avery, phone in hand.

"Your call, sir."

The secretary handed the phone over with a pointed look at Thaddeus.

Avery glanced at the screen, then ended the call with a flick of his thumb.

Gordon's line went dead.

He gaped, stunned.

Thaddeus paled.

"The owner you're looking for is me," Avery said smoothly. "But I'm afraid I've already chosen a partner. Your trip was wasted."

He turned to Evadne. "Ms. Evadne, I accept your proposal."

Her eyes widened as he extended his hand.

"Looking forward to working together."

A glance at Thaddeus's thunderous expression sent a thrill through her.

Winning felt good—even if it was almost too easy.

She smirked, dimples flashing, and shook Avery's hand. "To a successful partnership, Mr. Chambers."

The Abernathy Group staff watched in disbelief. Gordon looked ready to faint.

Acacia tried to soothe Thaddeus. "It's just a garden, Thad. We'll find another."

He jerked his arm away, sending her stumbling back.

"Shall we go, Mr. Chambers?" Evadne didn't spare them another glance.

"Of course. Dinner reservations await."

Their shared laughter felt like a knife twisting in Thaddeus's gut.

He strode forward, blocking Avery's path.

"A word, Mr. Chambers." His voice was steel.

"If it's about Rose Manor, we're done here."

"What if it's about something else?"

Thaddeus's gaze flicked to Evadne.

A beat later, Avery followed him to a secluded pavilion.

The air between them was glacial.

"Make it quick. I have plans with Ms. Evadne."

"A date? I thought this was business."

Thaddeus's jaw tightened. "Three years of marriage means I know her better than you ever will."

Avery scoffed. "Three years of neglect doesn't make you an expert on her."

Thaddeus's eyes flashed. "Been digging into my past?"

"Everything I do is for Evadne. You're irrelevant." Avery adjusted his glasses. "I never intended to work with Abernathy. She's the one I want."

Each mention of her name was a deliberate jab.

Thaddeus's voice dropped. "You think your polished act fools me? I know exactly who you are."

Avery didn't flinch.

"Evadne isn't some conquest. She deserves better than your games."

"Funny," Avery mused. "If you cared so much, why did you divorce her?"

The words struck like a blow.

"I may have flaws," Avery continued, "but my feelings for her are real. You married her and still chased others. Who are you to judge me?"

Thaddeus had no retort.

Avery stood. "Whether you regret it or not, she's no longer yours."

He paused at the exit.

"My pursuit of her was years in the making. Your three years mean nothing."

Alone in the pavilion, Thaddeus trembled, Avery's words echoing in his skull.

###Chapter 148

The last of the visitors had departed from Rose Manor, leaving only Isabella and Victoria alone in the twilight-kissed gardens.

As shadows lengthened across the manicured lawns, Isabella's natural beauty remained undiminished, her flawless complexion making Victoria's fingers curl with envy.

Despite their bitter history, Victoria couldn't deny Isabella's breathtaking allure.

Living with such perfection for three years, even in a marriage of convenience, had left Victoria seething with insecurity.

Victoria approached, smoothing her own hair with calculated grace, her smile sharp as broken glass. "Found yourself a new protector already? How efficient. Though really, you should have done this sooner. No matter how desperately you cling to Alexander, he'll never look at you twice."

Isabella regarded her with amused detachment. "Why would I need his attention? I'm not some performing circus animal."

Victoria's smirk faltered at the barb. Suppressing a snarl, she played her trump card. "Since we're being honest, let me share some happy news. Alexander and I are announcing our engagement on my birthday."

"How lovely. Though I'm afraid I didn't bring a gift." Isabella's tone dripped with disinterest.

The dismissive response ignited Victoria's temper. "You can pretend all you want, but I know you're seething inside. What does it matter? I'm the one Alexander chose, while you're just New York's most pathetic divorcee."

"Victoria darling," Isabella sighed, "every time we meet, it's either threats about stealing Alexander or boasting about your relationship. Is your life truly so empty? Beyond a divorced man, have you nothing else to define yourself?"

Victoria's face flushed scarlet. "How dare you!"

"I understand the urge to flaunt your wealthy catch, but find someone who cares. What you treasure is refuse I wouldn't touch again. How tedious."

"Refuse?" Victoria's voice rose to a shriek. "You're just jealous! The more vicious your words, the more you prove how much our relationship torments you! Three wasted years and Alexander still discarded you like yesterday's trash!"

A glacial shift came over Isabella's expression, making Victoria's blood run cold.

"People should learn when to stop. My patience isn't permission for your insolence. Cross me again, Miss Ashford, and I'll ensure your future becomes... complicated."

The name 'Ashford' struck Victoria like a physical blow, draining the color from her face.

She stumbled back a step, pulse hammering.

"That's an interesting reaction," Isabella observed with cold amusement. "Isn't Ashford the name you used abroad? Most people don't pale at hearing their own name."

"I don't know any Ashford! You're delusional!" Victoria's denial came too fast, her breathing ragged. The Ashford identity held everything she'd buried - the promiscuity, the illegitimate child, all anathema to the pure image she'd crafted for Alexander.

Isabella stepped closer, her smile razor-thin. "Names can change. Faces can change. But the past leaves marks even you can't erase. I've kept silent not from kindness, but indifference. Provoke me again, and I'll strip away every pretense."

Victoria's palms grew clammy, her heartbeat erratic.

When Alexander emerged from the manor, Isabella and Daniel had already departed.

After his unsettling conversation, he'd remained in the gardens, buffeted by cold winds until nightfall.

Now, after delivering Victoria to the hospital, Alexander returned to Windsor Estates with Lawrence.

The drive passed in tense silence, Lawrence's shirt damp with nervous sweat. "Mr. Kingsley, I... I can't apologize enough. Punish me as you see fit! This is entirely my failure—I had no idea we were dealing with Chambers Group representatives!"

His voice broke with genuine distress.

Alexander, who had been lost in thought, opened his eyes with a derisive snort. "You're weeping over this? At your age?"

"But this isn't insignificant, sir."

"The Chambers Group hasn't operated domestically in over a decade. Their obscurity isn't your failing."

Alexander exhaled sharply, massaging his temples. "Even with full intelligence, the outcome wouldn't change. He'd never have negotiated. Contact every comparable rose supplier in the country. We'll find alternatives."

"First thing tomorrow, sir!"

Lawrence mopped his brow, venturing carefully, "Mr. Chambers was remarkably generous to Mrs. Kingsley. Most businessmen would at least entertain multiple offers before committing to such a substantial deal."

The observation pierced Alexander like a blade.

Quietly, he asked, "Lawrence... was I truly so terrible to Isabella? Was I that cruel?"

Lawrence stiffened, caught between honesty and self-preservation.

"Speak freely. I won't hold it against you."

"Well, sir... materially, you were exceptionally generous. The finest homes, vehicles, unlimited credit..."

"A contractual arrangement requires proper compensation. I never withheld what was owed."

Alexander rubbed his brow, the weight of memory pressing down.

"If Mrs. Kingsley had viewed your union as purely transactional—prepared to depart after three years—then no, you did nothing wrong." Lawrence hesitated, then continued gravely, "The tragedy is that she loved you authentically. For three years, she endured your neglect and the Kingsleys' cruelty without complaint. To a woman who saw you as her husband, your treatment was... profoundly cold. All the money in the world must have felt like salt in the wound to someone who only wanted your heart."

Salt in the wound.

Alexander's throat constricted.

Emotions surged within him, a tempest he struggled to contain.

But the words "she loved you authentically" shattered his composure completely.
###Chapter 149

The evening unfolded with an unexpected twist when Alexander prepared an exquisite Japanese banquet for Isabella.

Imported bluefin tuna melted like butter on the tongue. Crispy tempura gave way to succulent shrimp. The grouper, fresh and rich, was perfection on a plate. Every bite was a revelation.

Isabella savored each dish, her cheeks flushed from the fine sake. The alcohol loosened her tongue, and soon she was chatting animatedly.

Alexander matched her effortlessly. Literature, music, gaming—no topic was beyond his grasp.

But the real shocker? They mained the same character in the same competitive MMO.

Isabella's eyes lit up as she gushed about raids and rankings. Her hands flew through the air, her excitement contagious.

Alexander listened intently, interjecting at just the right moments. His gaze held a warmth that bordered on indulgence.

Dinner ended too soon. They stepped out into the cool night, shoulders brushing.

Despite the lively conversation, Alexander never once mentioned their potential collaboration. The omission hung between them, deliberate and calculated.

Just as Isabella opened her mouth to address it, he beat her to the punch. "Ms. Sinclair, regarding Rose Manor, send over your proposal whenever you're ready. Once we finalize the details, we'll sign."

"Mr. Kingsley." She hesitated. "I know you chose me over the Vanderbilts today to spite Nathaniel."

Alexander merely smiled.

"But business isn't personal. You should evaluate all proposals fairly—even Nathaniel's. Despite our... history, I won't sabotage him."

The words had weighed on her since leaving Rose Manor.

Gaining an edge through merit was one thing. But leveraging Alexander's favor? That reeked of dependency—something the fiercely independent Isabella despised.

Alexander studied her, then nodded. "Logical. But even if he submits a proposal, my choice remains unchanged."

Isabella nearly groaned. Had he heard a word she'd said?

"Ms. Sinclair, I understand your concerns." His voice softened. "But I prefer working with those I trust. Nathaniel's a stranger. You? We share history... and interests."

Her pulse stuttered. Why did that sound like more than business?

"Fine. Since you insist, I'll ensure my proposal exceeds expectations. Though it may take time—my hotel venture demands attention."

"Take all the time you need." He opened her car door. "It's getting late."

She waved goodbye. As she settled into the seat, he leaned in.

"Ms. Sinclair."

"Yes?"

"Nathaniel spoke to me privately today. Aren't you curious what he said?"

The question hung in the air—a test she'd unwittingly passed by never asking.

Isabella laughed. "Not even slightly. Nathaniel and I are done. Whatever he said is irrelevant. Goodnight, Mr. Kingsley."

The Bugatti vanished into the night.

Alexander adjusted his glasses, lips curving. His chest felt strangely light.

Wind whipped through Isabella's hair as the car sped along the river. Neon lights blurred across the water, their reflections dancing like fire.

"You and Mr. Kingsley seemed... close," Jason ventured, grip tightening on the wheel.

"We clicked."

"After he stalked you to your villa? Forgive me if I'm not convinced."

Isabella rolled her eyes. "Maybe he was curious. Two encounters prove he's harmless—just eccentric. Helgen bluntness plus expat quirks." Her grin turned impish. "Plus, he games. We're teaming up next week!"

Jason's jaw clenched. "You've never warmed to a man this fast. Do you... like him?"

"Jason, if you value your eyes, stop imagining things." She shot him a look. "Even if I did, it's irrelevant unless he likes me first. And why waste energy on men when there's money to make?"

Jason's laughter was pure relief.

Thank God. She wasn't falling for his charm.

A speed bump jolted them. Something fluttered from the flower basket—a card.

Isabella unfolded it. Alexander's elegant script read: Life's too short for wasted time.

Her lips quirked. Interesting man.

"Did Victoria bother you today?" Jason asked darkly.

"What do you think? Leopards don't change their spots."

"She's desperate, Ms. Sinclair. She'll escalate."

"Which is why I need you elsewhere. Watch her mother, Arabella." Isabella stroked a rose petal, her smile icy. "After tonight, Victoria will make her move."

"You provoked her?"

"Bait, Jason. I reminded her of certain... missteps back home. She paled like she'd seen a ghost." Isabella chuckled. "With her Vanderbilt engagement looming, she'll eliminate every obstacle. Desperation breeds mistakes."

Realization dawned. "She'll relocate that girl!"

Isabella nodded. "Victoria's confined to the hospital. Arabella will handle it—she knows where the girl's hidden. The trap's set. Now we wait."

Back at the hospital, Victoria was unraveling—lost in terrified silence.
###Chapter 150

The chilling words Isabella had spoken echoed in her mind. Her nails dug into her palms as she paced the sterile hospital room like a caged animal.

"I can't just wait here like a sitting duck! Isabella's part of the Sinclair empire now, and she's cunning as a fox. She already knows about my overseas dealings - it's only a matter of time before she uncovers everything!"

Action was required. Immediate action.

With trembling fingers, Nathaniel dialed Harrison's number.

The line rang endlessly before a gruff voice answered, "Who the hell calls at this ungodly hour?"

"Harrison! Isabella's onto me and she'll expose us both soon!" Nathaniel's voice cracked with desperation, her eyes bloodshot. "You need to leave Windsor Estates immediately!"

"Trying to cut me loose?" The man's laugh was dark. "No money, no deal. That was our arrangement."

"If Isabella ruins my marriage to Sebastian, you'll get nothing!" Nathaniel hissed.

There was a pause. "Fine. But cross me, and you'll regret it."

"You'll get every penny! Just lay low until this blows over."

The call ended, but Nathaniel's hands wouldn't stop shaking.

She took three steadying breaths before dialing her mother Arabella. "Mom, come to the hospital now. It's urgent."

Meanwhile, the phone Harrison had used now powered down in Isabella's grasp.

For days, Harrison had been confined to the basement of The Chateau Royale under constant surveillance. Escape was impossible.

Still, he felt grateful Isabella allowed him to sit upright rather than dangling him by his ankles again. That position had nearly given him a cerebral hemorrhage. "Excellent performance. You're quite the actor." Isabella handed the phone to Lawrence with a sardonic smirk.

"At your service, Miss..." Harrison's pallid face glistened with sweat. His bandaged hands twitched at the memory of his injuries.

"Nathaniel's birthday approaches." Isabella crossed her legs elegantly, the picture of relaxed confidence. "You'll perform one final act for us. Succeed, and your sentence will be reduced. Fail..." Her smile turned razor-sharp. "Let's just say prison will seem like paradise."

"I'll do whatever you ask!" Harrison's head bobbed like a buoy in stormy seas.

Isabella's expression softened. "I hear you've been surviving on two bread crusts daily? That won't do." She nodded to Lawrence. "Bring him a proper meal."

Within minutes, Lawrence presented a tray bearing two gourmet sandwiches, a roasted chicken, and an ice-cold beer.

Harrison's eyes bulged at the feast. After days of stale bread, saliva mixed with tears streamed down his unshaven face.

"Eat. Courtesy of Miss Isabella." Lawrence placed the tray before him like one might feed a stray dog.

Harrison swallowed hard, voice trembling. "Miss Isabella...is this...my last meal?"

Later, exiting The Chateau Royale, Isabella stretched like a satisfied cat. "Home, Lawrence."

"But Miss Isabella, why feed that snake?" Lawrence's fists clenched at the memory. "After what he did, he deserves to starve!"

"Every pawn has its purpose." Isabella yawned elegantly. "After weeks in that basement, Harrison despises Nathaniel. But if I show mercy at his breaking point..." Her lips curved. "All that hatred redirects. He'll destroy Nathaniel for us."

"Brilliant!" Lawrence's admiration shone through. "I can't wait to watch them tear each other apart."

One week later...

After inspecting The Regent Grand's impeccable operations, Isabella returned to her office for some well-earned gaming time.

In six months under her leadership, the hotel hadn't just maintained its five-star rating - it won "Most Popular Luxury Destination of the Year."

But Isabella wasn't satisfied. She wanted the coveted "World's Best Hotel" title for five consecutive years.

The Sinclair Group's fortunes were changing under her command.

Recently, three major media outlets had interviewed her. Lawrence never imagined his camera-shy boss would grant interviews - until he understood her strategy.

To become CEO of Vanderbilt Industries, bloodline alone wouldn't suffice. She needed the board to witness her brilliance firsthand.

Sebastian had given her this hotel as a test. She intended to exceed every expectation.

Victory chimes sounded from her game. She reached for the intercom to summon Lawrence before remembering she'd sent him on an errand.

Seven days had passed. Nathaniel's birthday loomed in two days, yet Lawrence hadn't returned.

Isabella chuckled, eyes closed, fingers drumming a rhythmic tattoo on her desk.

Her instincts never failed. She could wait.

The phone rang.

Seeing it was her dear friend Camille, Isabella answered with genuine warmth. "Camille! What delightful news do you bring?"

Gone was Camille's usual haughty demeanor. Her voice bubbled with uncharacteristic cheer. "Isabella, I've baked pastries and brewed exceptional coffee. Could you spare time to visit? I'd love to thank you properly."

Isabella laughed. "Let me guess - Maison de Valois's new collection arrived, and you want my opinion?"

"You see through everything!" Camille feigned exasperation.

"Camille, your designs stand on their own now. You've become an icon, inspiring countless designers." Isabella's tone turned earnest. "Trust your instincts. My input would only dilute your unique vision. Have confidence!"

"Thank you...I'd be nothing without you." Camille's humility remained. To her, Isabella would always be incomparable.

"Actually..." Camille hesitated. "Something happened earlier that might upset you."

"Oh?"

"That woman Nathaniel came demanding to borrow a dress again." Camille's voice dripped venom. "She had the audacity to request the silver one-shoulder gown from my private collection!"

"Did you lend it?" Isabella's voice remained calm.

"I did...and I'm sorry..."

"I trust your judgment completely." No reproach colored Isabella's words.

"It's last season's design, and the measurements are all wrong for her. But she insisted!" Camille's laugh was icy. "I warned her - alter one stitch with even a safety pin, and she'll pay five times its value."

"Do you foresee...complications with such an ill-fitting gown?" Isabella asked mildly.

"If there are, the embarrassment will be entirely hers." Camille's smile was audible. "Wouldn't that be poetic?"
###Chapter 151

Isabella Sinclair had been working tirelessly to prepare for her grand birthday celebration.

She was finally full of energy again, no longer the frail, bedridden girl from before. Not only was she securing the perfect venue, but she was also meticulously selecting her gown and makeup. To an outsider, it might have looked like she was planning her engagement party.

Throughout all this, Alexander Kingsley had remained distant. Seeing her improved condition, he hadn't returned to the hospital to visit.

Of course, this stung Isabella's pride. But right now, orchestrating the perfect birthday event took precedence over everything else.

The night before the party, Isabella was in her room trying on the designer dress she'd borrowed from Camille Dubois.

Though slender, the bust of the dress gaped awkwardly on her petite frame. Her two maids worked frantically but couldn't make it fit properly.

"You useless fools! What good are you if you can't even help me with a simple dress?" Isabella snapped, her cheeks flushing with anger as she shoved one maid away.

"Miss Sinclair, perhaps we could call a tailor for alterations? Or maybe use some discreet safety pins..." one maid timidly suggested.

Isabella wiped her brow in frustration. She couldn't admit the real reason - she refused to pay the exorbitant damage fees.

The dress was worth over a hundred thousand, and she'd already signed a binding agreement.

Any stains, damage, alterations - even pinning it - would require her to compensate Camille five times the original price. And with Camille being Evadne's ally? Not a single penny would go to that woman!

"Bring me double-sided tape! Now! Move!"

Soon, the maids returned with tape, carefully applying it inside the dress's bodice. When Isabella slipped it on again, the fit was perfect.

"Miss Sinclair, you're brilliant! This works perfectly!" one maid gushed.

Isabella exhaled in relief, a smug smile playing on her lips.

Just then, a sharp knock interrupted them. Eleanor Sinclair entered, her expression tense.

"Mother!" Isabella cried.

"Out! All of you!" Isabella immediately dismissed the maids.

As the door clicked shut behind them, Eleanor locked it securely.

"Mother? Did everything go as planned?" Isabella asked anxiously, gripping her mother's hands.

"It's done." Eleanor's grasp was icy cold.

"Oh Mother, thank you!"

Isabella squeezed her mother's hands tighter, her eyes darkening. "You've always been my greatest ally. I'll repay your kindness tenfold!"

"You're my only daughter. Of course I'd move heaven and earth for you."

Eleanor's face was pale but determined. "With you and Alexander reunited, and Frederic supporting your marriage, we're so close now! I won't let anyone - or anything - stand between you and your rightful place in high society!"

The much-anticipated birthday gala arrived the following evening.

The Sterling Group had reserved the grand ballroom at The Regal Palace Hotel, a deliberate display of the families' alliance.

To bolster her niece's standing, Margaret had leveraged Frederic's influence to invite Elmsworth's elite and national dignitaries. The scale rivaled that of a royal wedding.

The ballroom glittered under crystal chandeliers, alive with orchestral music and the rustle of designer gowns.

Every influential figure in Elmsworth had come - all due to Frederic's prestige.

Despite Margaret's recent police investigation (later proven to be her cousin's doing), she now stood radiant beside her husband, charming guests with effortless grace.

"Mr. Frederic, Margaret, congratulations!"

"The congratulations should go to my darling niece today," Margaret beamed in her couture gown.

"Since Ms. Sinclair is your fiancée, we should congratulate you both! The Abernathy dynasty gains a new jewel tonight!"

"Thank you, thank you!"

Nearby, Evelyn Prescott and her socialite friends exchanged knowing glances.

"Congratulations, Evelyn! You're gaining a sister-in-law," one girl teased.

"Correction - another sister-in-law," another giggled. "Out with the old, in with the new, right? And since Ms. Sinclair is Margaret's niece, you'll all get along famously, won't you?"

Evelyn forced a smile while silently seething.

"I heard Ms. Sinclair and Mr. Frederic have a star-crossed love story - separated for years, overcoming countless obstacles. That he's marrying her immediately after his divorce proves it's true love. Evelyn, your brother's lucky. When will you introduce us to your beau?"

Evelyn's eyes darted across the room, searching for her beloved Mr. Jareth.

Meanwhile, Mr. Jareth was in a private suite with Alexander Kingsley.

Both men wore custom-tailored suits, seated before floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the city lights.

Jareth's white suit with black shirt and gold rose pendant exuded rakish charm.

Alexander, as always, wore all black - his gold lapel pin the only concession to ornamentation, underscoring his formidable presence.

"My god," Jareth teased, swirling his whiskey. "Dressed like that, people might think you're attending a funeral."

Alexander's icy gaze flickered. "Black signifies mourning, but white doesn't?"

"Life's truly fair - giving you this face but pairing it with that mouth. Perfection!" Jareth's eyes caught on Alexander's tie pin. "That's unique. Mind if I borrow it sometime?"

Alexander's expression darkened. "Dream on."

"Tsk - we used to share everything, even underwear. Now you're stingy with a tie pin? Age really does change people."

Their banter was interrupted by Daniel Carter's arrival.

"Mr. Kingsley, Ms. Sinclair requests your presence for the birthday toast. She's waiting on stage."

"Not going." Alexander's voice was glacial.

"Excellent! I'll tell her you're declining!" Daniel barely concealed his glee.

Nothing pleased him more than thwarting Isabella.

"Considering that girl recently self-harmed due to depression, and is only now recovering, you're fine with pushing her over the edge again?" Jareth arched a brow.

"I can't share that stage with her tonight," Alexander said quietly.

"Why not? Aren't you her devoted fiancé?"

"I'm ending our relationship."

Jareth's glass froze mid-air. Daniel nearly choked.

"I haven't told her yet, given her fragile state," Alexander continued evenly. "Once she's stronger, I'll explain. I owe her that much - she did save my life once."

Jareth's eyes narrowed with sudden understanding. He leaned in close.

"Alexander... be honest. Is part of this because you've developed feelings for Evadne? Isn't it?"

Alexander felt his breath catch, his chest constricting.

After a weighted pause, he ground out: "No."
###Chapter 152

At the Windsor Estates, Isabella Sinclair was basking in the glow of attention.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Prescott sped down the winding roads of Havenbrook in her sleek convertible, the night air whipping through her hair.

The stereo blasted her favorite song, and she sang along at the top of her lungs, feeling utterly carefree.

Then her phone buzzed—Nathan Prescott was calling.

"Nathan," she answered, her voice dripping with sweetness.

"Damn, Evelyn, that voice of yours could melt steel. I should record it and make Adrian Lockwood seethe with jealousy!" Nathan laughed, his tone brimming with excitement.

"You're calling me now—does that mean everything's ready?" Evelyn asked.

"Locked and loaded. Sebastian Lockwood is prepped on his end too."

Nathan sounded smug. "Sebastian and I have this under control. You just sit back and enjoy the show."

"I'm on my way to see Mr. Kingsley. I heard Elspeth dragged everyone from the Vanderbilt group to Isabella's birthday bash tonight—except him."

Evelyn sighed. "I know he secretly loves a little chaos, but he keeps it quiet to avoid being a burden. Still, I also know he hates being alone. He's always been so kind to me—it's my turn to keep him company."

Whenever she thought of Mr. Kingsley, Evelyn's expression softened, a pang of sympathy tugging at her heart.

Back when she was still married to Alexander Kingsley, she used to spend hours with Mr. Kingsley—chatting, practicing calligraphy, appraising antiques. She'd sing for him, take seaside walks with him.

One Valentine's Day, New York was buried under the heaviest snowfall in years.

Evelyn trudged through the storm to Mr. Kingsley's mansion, homemade pastries in hand.

She remembered how his eyes widened when he saw her—her cheeks and nose bright red from the cold.

"Evelyn, it's Valentine's Day! Shouldn't you be with Alexander? Why are you here with me?" he'd asked.

Back then, she'd still made excuses for Alexander. She'd forced smiles, masking the loneliness.

"Alexander is a busy CEO. He barely has time to breathe, even on Valentine's Day."

She'd shrugged. "But he did get me a gift. It's the thought that counts."

Evelyn, you're too soft-hearted. You need to toughen up, or Alexander will walk all over you!

When I was young, I was just as stubborn as him. Fiona Vanderbilt would either put me in time-out or pinch my thighs. That's how she straightened me out.

Evelyn had only laughed at his words.

They'd watched the snow together in silence until Mr. Kingsley suddenly asked,

"Evelyn, are you cold?"

"Not at all!"

"Then let's go. Keep me company while I visit Fiona."

His eyes held a depth of longing that mirrored Evelyn's own. "She hated the cold."

—

"Mr. Kingsley! I'm here!"

Just like old times, Evelyn announced her arrival with that bright, ringing voice, filling every corner of the grand living room.

"Evelyn!"

The reply came in a voice just as warm, tinged with childlike delight.

Then Margaret Kingsley appeared, pushing Mr. Kingsley's wheelchair.

"Margaret! You're here too!"

Seeing her, Evelyn's joy doubled. She rushed forward and pulled her into a tight embrace.

Margaret hugged her back, patting her slender frame with concern. "Evelyn, you're skin and bones! You weren't this thin before. Are you eating properly?"

"I eat like a horse, I swear," Evelyn said with a grin.

Truthfully, she had lost weight lately. Between her hectic schedule and skipped meals, it was no surprise.

"Evelyn, come here—let me look at you properly!" Mr. Kingsley beamed, still calling her by that old nickname.

Evelyn didn't mind. She'd severed all ties with Alexander.

To her, "Evelyn" wasn't a painful reminder of the past. As long as Mr. Kingsley was happy, she was too.

"You look a little pale. Not sleeping well?" She crouched beside his wheelchair, studying him with concern.

"Just my old ailment acting up again. Nothing serious." He patted her head reassuringly, though his pallor was noticeable.

Evelyn immediately went into doctor mode. She took his wrist, checking his pulse with quiet focus.

After a moment, she said firmly, "Starting now, I'm making time every week to treat you. I'll prepare medicine—Mr. Murray will remind you to take it."

"Evelyn, you're the heiress of the Sinclair family now. William adores you. You can't waste your time on me. Alexander mentioned you're managing the Sinclair hotels? You're working too hard. Don't trouble yourself—Mr. Murray is enough."

Though he longed to see her more, he worried about her exhaustion.

Evelyn blinked, surprised. She hadn't expected Alexander to be discussing her with Mr. Kingsley.

He used to ignore her like she was invisible.

Now that they were divorced, suddenly he cared? What was his game?

"So just because I'm William's daughter now, I'm no longer your granddaughter?"

She arched a brow, teasing. "These legs are mine. I go where I want, do what I want. William doesn't get a say. Hmph!"

Her playful antics had Mr. Kingsley and Margaret laughing.

Then her phone buzzed again.

A text from Nathaniel Whitmore flashed on the screen.

Ms. Evelyn, everything's in place. Awaiting your signal.

—

In the banquet hall, the stage was a sea of flowers.

The house lights dimmed as the stage lights brightened.

Alexander Kingsley and Lucas Grant chose that moment to stride in.

Despite their low-key entrance, every head turned.

Whispers rippled through the crowd.

"Mr. Kingsley actually showed up to Isabella's birthday party? Given how aloof he is, she must really have his favor."

"You think this is just a birthday party?" someone scoffed. "Look—Reginald Vanderbilt, Sophia, Frederic, Elspeth—they're all here. This is clearly an announcement in disguise."

"Ah, so that's why. Smart move coming, then. Any juicy details?"

"Ugh, ignorance is bliss. I'm close to the Vanderbilts. When Alexander got married, it was kept under wraps—no ceremony, no fanfare. His ex-wife stayed invisible for three years. Now he's making a spectacle of his girlfriend's birthday? The wedding will be a circus. If I were his ex, I'd be devastated!"

The gossip twisted Alexander's gut.

He'd never felt guilty toward Evelyn before the divorce.

Now, he felt like the villain in everyone's story—his past mistakes laid bare for judgment.

"Alexander, you okay? You look off," Lucas murmured, nudging him.

"I'm fine," Alexander said tightly, struggling to keep his composure.

In the front row sat Frederic, Reginald, and Sophia Vanderbilt. Their presence screamed engagement party.

Suddenly, the lights twinkled, and celebratory music swelled.

To thunderous applause, Isabella ascended the stage in a custom Maison de Valois gown dripping with diamonds, Elspeth at her side. She bowed gracefully to the crowd.

"Look! That's a Camille Dubois original!" someone gasped.

"Stunning... A million-dollar dress for a birthday? The Vanderbilts really spoil her!"

Isabella soaked in the praise, glowing with triumph.

Her only regret? Alexander wasn't standing beside her.

But nothing could dampen her joy tonight.

She was the undisputed princess of the hour.

"Thank you all for joining me on this special night. Your presence makes it unforgettable."

As she spoke, Elspeth took her hand, gazing at her like a proud mother. "And now, we have an important announcement."

The room fell silent.

Frederic's smile was unreadable, while Reginald and Sophia's eyes gleamed with anticipation.

"Isabella and Alexander Kingsley will soon be officially engaged!"

###Chapter 153

The audience erupted in gasps, then burst into thunderous applause louder than before!

Nathaniel Kingsley stared at Sebastian in shock, his eyes filled with visible concern.

Sebastian remained motionless. An icy aura radiated from his body, so intense it felt like anyone who touched him would freeze instantly.

A spotlight suddenly illuminated Sebastian, casting an eerie glow on his pale features.

"Arabella and Sebastian have been childhood friends who've shared countless memories together. Now they're finally getting married! The Vanderbilt family is delighted to announce this wonderful news at tonight's birthday celebration!"

Margaret gripped Arabella's hand tightly, her joyous expression and lyrical tone making it seem like they were already at the wedding ceremony!

Arabella blushed, her eyes shining with shy happiness.

She gazed lovingly at Sebastian on stage, mistaking his stony expression for nervousness.

Meanwhile, in another location...

Isabella was preparing cream of mushroom soup for Reginald Vanderbilt and Charlotte in the kitchen.

"Oh no! Something terrible has happened!" Charlotte rushed in, her face ghostly pale and hands trembling violently.

What could it be?

"Mr. Vanderbilt! Mr. Vanderbilt has collapsed!" Charlotte was so distraught she nearly burst into tears.

"What?!"

Isabella's pupils constricted as her heart pounded violently. She immediately dropped her utensils and sprinted from the kitchen.

In the living room, Reginald lay sprawled on the floor. His eyes stared blankly at the ceiling while his limbs twitched weakly, foam forming at his mouth!

Isabella recognized the symptoms immediately - it was clearly a stroke!

"Mr. Vanderbilt! I've called an ambulance, just hold on!" Lawrence was frantic, on the verge of tears.

"Stay calm, Lawrence! I won't let anything happen to Mr. Vanderbilt!"

Clenching her jaw, Isabella dropped to her knees beside Reginald and began administering emergency treatment.

Lawrence and Charlotte stared in stunned silence. She moved with such medical precision - the only thing missing was a doctor's coat!

"Lawrence, is grandfather's emergency kit still here?" Isabella's forehead glistened with sweat, her voice urgent.

"Yes!"

"Bring it now!"

Isabella took a deep breath, her anxious eyes never leaving Reginald. "We can't wait for the ambulance. Every second counts. I need to treat grandfather during the golden hour!"

She was an expert at battling Death itself.

Back at the banquet...

Arabella and Margaret's announcement had brought the celebration to its climax!

All the women in attendance shot envious, jealous glances at Arabella, who stood on stage looking like a fairy-tale princess.

"How did Arabella get so lucky to marry Mr. Sebastian? I'm green with envy!"

"Look how loose her wedding dress is. Do you think she's pregnant? It's common for wealthy families to get pregnant before marriage!"

"Now that you mention it... When Arabella first appeared, her dress did seem unusually flowy. It's very possible!"

"Pregnant before marriage? That can't be true love. She's taking shortcuts - how despicable."

"If scheming could get me married to Mr. Sebastian, I'd do it too! This is hitting the jackpot!"

Arabella heard every whispered comment from the women below the stage.

Yet she held her head high like a regal swan, unbothered and radiating confidence.

"Keep talking, all of you! My glorious life is just beginning, and you'll always be beneath me!" she thought smugly.

"Seb! Look at this!"

Nathaniel shoved his phone at Sebastian, showing the trending topic on Twitter.

#SebastianAndArabellaEngagement topped the charts.

"Seb, I'm completely lost here," Nathaniel said anxiously. "Didn't you tell me you were breaking up with Arabella? How did Margaret announce your engagement? And it's already trending!"

"Mr. Vanderbilt doesn't seem opposed either. What's going on? Are you two broken up or not?"

Sebastian's ears rang as tension coiled through his back beneath the tailored suit.

The fury building in his chest threatened to explode!

Suddenly—

The massive screen, previously displaying soft pink floral animations, plunged into abrupt darkness.

"What's happening?"

"Is it a power outage? Did the screen malfunction?"

Just as murmurs of confusion spread, the screen flickered back to life.

But now it displayed a photograph of a young girl.

The child in the photo was painfully thin and small, with tangled hair and tattered clothes, her face streaked with tears.

The heartbreaking image made several guests gasp.

"Oh my God! Whose child is this? The poor little thing!"

"Is Ms. Arabella using her birthday to raise charity funds? I'll definitely donate - I'm very passionate about philanthropy!"

Hearing the chatter below, Arabella and Victoria exchanged alarmed glances before turning toward the screen.

"What...what's going on?" Victoria looked stunned.

"Who is this filthy child? How could such a photo appear at my birthday banquet? There must be some mistake!"

Arabella's mouth hung open as she stared blankly at the girl on screen.

Meanwhile, Victoria had gone deathly pale. She leapt from her chair, pointing at the screen and shrieking, "What is this?! Turn it off! Turn the screen off immediately!"

The outburst drew surprised stares from those nearby.

Reginald and Mr. Sterling exchanged confused glances, bewildered by Victoria's extreme reaction to a technical glitch.

"Why turn it off?"

A rough, gravelly voice suddenly cut through the murmurs.

Arabella's head snapped toward the sound.

When she saw the speaker's face, she nearly screamed in terror!

Cold sweat drenched Arabella's expensive designer gown. Her legs trembled uncontrollably as her carefully applied makeup made her face resemble a frozen mask, incapable of expression.

The rugged man stepped into the light, immediately capturing everyone's attention.

"We should be together as a family. While you're all here enjoying fine food and wine, this poor child suffers abuse and humiliation in an orphanage - starving, freezing. As her mother, Arabella, doesn't that break your heart?"
###Chapter 154

What?

Isabella's daughter?!

Isabella trembled violently, her mind blank as if struck by lightning.

This had to be real.

The longer she stared at the girl on the screen, the more she saw herself in those features.

"No... No way..." Isabella whispered, her voice barely audible.

Nathaniel let out a bitter laugh, his eyes dark with contempt. "What a twisted joke. A mother who can't even recognize her own child. How noble of you."

The room erupted into chaos. His words were a boulder crashing into still waters, sending shockwaves through the crowd.

Half the guests gaped at Isabella, frozen in horror on stage.

The other half turned to Alexander, whose expression was colder than ice.

"Isabella!" Elspeth hissed, gripping her arm hard enough to bruise. "Explain yourself! Who is this man? What is he talking about?"

Victoria, desperate to cover her own sins, lunged at Nathaniel.

"You lying snake! How dare you slander Isabella!"

Nathaniel sidestepped effortlessly, sending Victoria sprawling face-first onto the floor.

Snickers filled the room. The sight was too humiliating.

Mr. Sterling wanted to disappear. He couldn’t believe this woman was his wife.

"Guards!" Isabella shrieked, ignoring Victoria completely. "Get him out of here! Now!"

Nathaniel's fury burned hotter. He opened his mouth—

Then a voice cut through the noise like a blade.

"No one touches him."

Alexander was livid.

His jaw clenched as he strode toward Isabella, his gaze piercing through her.

She had once been his angel, his light. She swore she loved only him.

Now, she was a stranger.

"Alexander, please!" Isabella stumbled forward, nearly tripping in her haste. She clutched his arm, nails digging in. "This is a setup! He’s lying! You have to believe me!"

Nathaniel scoffed. "Only loved him? Funny. I lost count of how many times we slept together."

"I’ll sue you!" Isabella shrieked. "For defamation! For spreading lies!"

"Sue me?" Nathaniel yanked a document from his pocket and flung it at her. "This is the DNA test. Try denying that."

Gasps filled the room.

"Oh my God! She really had a child with him?"

"And abandoned it? Heartless!"

"This is scandalous!"

Amid the uproar, Daniel picked up the report and examined it. He showed it to Alexander, loud enough for everyone to hear.

"It’s from a certified lab. It’s real."

Alexander closed his eyes.

Isabella’s last shred of hope shattered.

"Alexander, I—I was depressed back then! You know that! I wasn’t in control of myself!"

She played the victim, tears streaming.

On stage, Elspeth seethed.

She was furious at Isabella’s recklessness.

And terrified because it was all true.

"Depression?" Nathaniel laughed coldly. "You’re a liar, not a victim."

The screen changed again.

A medical report appeared—undeniable proof.

"Your therapist kept records. You took the fake, but he kept the truth."

Nathaniel spat at her feet. "Get tested for STDs instead."

"Shut up!" Isabella screamed, her face crimson.

But she still turned to Alexander, tears in her eyes. "Don’t believe him—"

Alexander wrenched his arm away.

She nearly fell.

His laugh was hollow, his voice trembling.

He laughed at his own blindness.

At the years he wasted on her lies.

At the pain he caused Evadne because of them.

No wonder Evadne hated him.

Right now, he hated himself too.

"We’re done."

Isabella’s knees buckled. "W-what?"

Then—

The doors burst open.

Four officers marched in, their footsteps echoing.

Isabella whimpered, shrinking back—

But they walked right past her.

Straight to Victoria.

"W-what are you doing?!" Victoria shrieked, scrambling to her feet.

"Victoria Sterling?"

The officer snapped cuffs around her wrists.

"You’re under arrest for conspiracy to commit murder."
###Chapter 155

The entire room froze in shock, all gazes locked onto Isabella Sinclair.

Everyone understood the police wouldn't make such a dramatic arrest without irrefutable evidence.

The conclusion was inevitable - Isabella had hired an assassin to do her dirty work.

Staring at the cold metal cuffs around her wrists, Isabella felt her world plunge into utter darkness.

How? How could this happen?

She'd vetted the hitman thoroughly. Paid top dollar. Conducted everything overseas. How had it unraveled?

"Isabella! Isabella!"

Nathaniel Prescott watched in horror as officers led his daughter away. His heart pounded violently before a sharp pain lanced through his chest. Darkness swallowed his vision as he collapsed.

"Call an ambulance! Now!" Frederick Prescott barked, his face ghostly pale as staff rushed to assist the unconscious patriarch.

Oliver Sinclair gaped, muttering, "Holy hell, Isabella just got arrested for murder! This is tonight's headline!"

Alexander Kingsley observed the scene impassively, showing no intention of aiding the Prescott family.

"Play with lives, pay the price," he remarked coolly.

Under the crowd's stunned scrutiny, Isabella was escorted out. As she passed Evelyn Prescott, their eyes met - and that single glance shattered Evelyn completely.

"Stop! She didn't kill anyone!" Evelyn screamed, only to hear fabric slithering down her body.

Gasps erupted as her designer off-shoulder gown pooled at her feet, leaving her standing in only undergarments before the entire gala.

"Ahhh!" Evelyn shrieked, crossing her arms over her exposed chest in humiliation.

Margaret Laurent instantly regretted organizing this birthday celebration. The disaster unfolding was beyond mortifying.

Meanwhile, Vanessa Wright sipped champagne in a shadowed corner, grinning wildly at Evelyn's spectacular downfall. Guests already had phones out, capturing every scandalous moment.

"Honestly, nothing special to see. You dodged a bullet breaking up with her," Oliver commented lazily, amusement glinting in his eyes.

Alexander felt their decade-long friendship had become some cruel cosmic joke.

He turned sharply and strode toward the exit.

"Alexander, wait!" Evelyn cried out desperately - then realized too late she'd just fully exposed herself again.

"Oh my God! Look at Evelyn's stomach! Those marks!"

"Stretch marks! Definitely stretch marks!"

"I've had three children - those are 100% pregnancy stretch marks!"

"Disgusting! She's already had a child and still played the virgin?!"

"Poor Mr. Kingsley nearly married that fraud!"

It was over.

Evelyn's dreams of becoming a CEO's wife evaporated in that instant.

In the hallway, Alexander walked with leaden steps. Oliver followed quietly, struggling to find words.

"Do I look pathetic? Stupid? Laughable?" Alexander's voice emerged hoarse and raw.

Oliver shook his head firmly. "No. You're my brother, Alex. I'd never laugh at you. I just... I'm sorry."

"Sorry?" Alexander closed his eyes, purging all memories of Evelyn from his mind.

"Don't be. My blindness caused this."

"Not for that." Oliver's expression twisted in pain. "I'm sorry about those three years with Arabella. Without Evelyn's interference... maybe you two could have been happy together."

Happy together.

Alexander froze mid-step, his vision blurring.

"Alexander, can we... not divorce? Because... I love you." Arabella's voice echoed hauntingly in his mind.

A searing pain lanced through his chest. He braced against the wall, fingers trembling violently. The suffocating agony was unbearable.

Back then, when Arabella had begged through tears not to end their marriage, he'd dismissed it as desperation. He'd seen their union as a cage to escape.

Now he understood.

Arabella hadn't been trying to trap him. That confession had been her laying bare her soul, sacrificing all dignity just to remain in his life.

She'd known he didn't love her.

Yet she'd fought to stay, terrified divorce would strip her right to love him entirely.

"That child looked three or four years old," Oliver continued grimly. "Meaning Evelyn was sleeping with George while still stringing you along, making you believe she was suffering abroad waiting for you. The truth? She had a whole secret life."

Alexander's entire body shook, each breath feeling like shards of glass in his lungs.

"Evelyn always had other lovers. You were just one option." Oliver met his gaze squarely. "But Arabella? Her heart only ever held you. Remember that rainy night you went to her place? Know what she told me?"

Alexander stared blankly, sweat beading on his forehead.

"I confessed to her. She refused me point blank." Oliver gave a bitter smile. "She said she'd never love anyone but Alexander Kingsley. And if she lost you, she'd never love again."

Alexander's pupils contracted violently. The pain was a sword through his ribs, every nerve ending screaming.

"Arabella, you swore you'd never love another. So our meeting wasn't three years ago. I've been in your life far longer, haven't I? I need answers, Arabella. Damn it, I need the truth!"

His phone buzzed abruptly. Seeing Lawrence Bennett's caller ID, Alexander's stomach dropped - had something happened to Mr. Blackwood? He answered immediately. "Lawrence? Is Mr. Blackwood alright?"

"Mr. Kingsley! Mr. Blackwood's had a stroke! Get to Grand Marquis Hospital now!"

"What?!" Alexander's blood ran cold.

"Don't panic - he's stabilized in a regular ward. Out of critical condition." Lawrence's voice held palpable relief. "Thank God for Ms. Sinclair. Her first aid bought crucial time. Without her, Mr. Blackwood might not have made it!"

Heat scalded Alexander's cheeks. The humiliation burned like a brand.
###Chapter 156

The scandal between Mrs. Sterling and Isabella exploded across social media in an instant, setting the internet ablaze.

Twitter was no longer buzzing about Thaddeus and Isabella's engagement—now, all eyes were on Isabella's daughter, Evelyn, who was being investigated for murder.

Leaked footage from the birthday party showed Isabella losing control, causing a scene, and even her dress slipping off, leaving her exposed in front of everyone. The video spread like wildfire, turning the whole affair into a viral spectacle.

The backlash was brutal.

Netizens tore into Isabella mercilessly.

Many couldn't stomach her actions—abandoning her own daughter to claw her way up the social ladder. A petition even surfaced, demanding legal consequences for her behavior.

"She doesn’t even acknowledge her own child. Left her overseas and never looked back. Is she even human? Dogs protect their pups better than she does!"

"Don’t insult dogs by comparing them to her. She’s not worthy."

"Wait, did I hear that right? Thaddeus divorced because he was in love with her? That’s just tragic."

"Thaddeus must have terrible taste. I don’t know his ex-wife, but I’m sure she’s miles better than this mess."

"His ex-wife better than her? That’s not even a fair comparison!"

"Childhood sweethearts? More like a disaster waiting to happen."

"Someone needs to turn this into a drama series. I’d binge-watch the hell out of it!"

Ruining someone’s reputation had never been easier.

Only the Ashbourne family knew the truth—this wasn’t just chaos. It was a meticulously orchestrated takedown. From discovery to exposure, every step had been carefully planned. Evadne had pushed Isabella from the heights of society straight into the gutter.

Evadne was patient. She rarely acted.

But when she did, she made sure her enemies never got back up.

Outside the Abernathy Hotel, the scene was pure pandemonium—reporters, spectators, and police cars clogged the entrance.

When Evelyn appeared, she was ghostly pale, barely able to stand. Two officers had to drag her into the police car.

Bystanders filmed the arrest, uploading it to social media in real time.

Across the street, inside a sleek Rolls-Royce, Cassius Ashbourne and Arnold watched the scene unfold before rolling up the tinted windows.

"I was going to suggest hiring some influencers to amplify the scandal, but it looks like the public is doing all the work for us," Arnold mused, scrolling through the relentless backlash on Twitter, his sharp eyes glinting with amusement.

Cassius paused mid-sip of his coffee, raising a brow. "Arnold, you’re a decent man in many ways, but this stinginess? Can you tone it down?"

"You’re Emeric Ashbourne’s son. A few million dollars is pocket change to you, isn’t it?" Arnold shot back.

"Stingy? When have I ever been stingy with Evadne?" Arnold huffed, looking genuinely offended.

"Exactly. Only with Evadne are you generous. With everyone else? Not so much."

Cassius smirked, taking another sip. "Isn’t this for Evadne too?"

Arnold grinned. "We both played our parts. You handled the outside, I took care of the inside. You did most of the heavy lifting—I wouldn’t dream of stealing your credit. Besides, you’re older. Shouldn’t you be looking out for me?"

Cassius chuckled and gave him a light smack on the back. "You’ve gotten sharper as a prosecutor."

Arnold’s phone buzzed just as he was about to pull it out.

"Speak of the devil—Aaron’s calling."

He answered immediately. "Aaron, how’s it going on your end?"

"Evelyn’s in custody. The bastard who hurt Evadne? He’s next," Aaron growled, his voice rough with anger. "Don’t worry—I’ll make sure he pays."

Suri Bright Ashbourne had three children—each formidable in their own right.

Hubery Waverley, the elite pilot.

Daryl Ashbourne, the future First Lady of Helgen.

And Aaron, who had dreamed of being a cop since childhood. Now, he was captain of Elmsworth’s first detective squad.

"Good! Beat him until he can’t hurt anyone ever again!" Arnold’s excitement flared, punching the car window in emphasis. "Can’t the police use… creative interrogation methods? Prosecutors don’t have that luxury. Don’t waste this chance to make him suffer!"

Cassius sighed, shaking his head.

The Ashbourne women were elegant, refined.

The men? Brutal. Unrelenting. More ruthless than even Cassius, who had spent years in the underworld.

Cassius, Arnold, and Aaron—working together.

Anyone they targeted was doomed.

Meanwhile, Thaddeus had abandoned everything to rush to the hospital where Mr. Hamilton was being treated. Jareth, unable to stop him, followed close behind.

Mr. Hamilton was the only person in the Abernathy family who truly cared for Thaddeus.

The only one who treated him like family.

Thaddeus ran like a man possessed, his throat raw as he muttered Mr. Hamilton’s name under his breath.

When he burst into the corridor, he saw Evadne sitting on a bench, cradling Mari in her arms. The scene was serene, almost ethereal—like a painting.

Her lashes lowered as she gently stroked the girl’s hair, her expression peaceful, radiating quiet strength.

She was always there when someone needed her.

A pang of guilt struck him.

Thank God she was here.

Hearing his footsteps, Evadne lifted her gaze.

For a fleeting moment, warmth flickered in her clear eyes—just long enough to send his heart racing.

Then it vanished, replaced by icy detachment.

"Is the birthday party over? You left everything behind to come here, Mr. Thaddeus. How… noble."

Her words weren’t cruel, but they cut deep.

He approached slowly, regret heavy in his eyes.

Evadne looked away, wishing she could shut him out completely. "Mr. Hamilton is resting. Mr. Murray is with him. You can wait outside."

"Evadne… I’m sorry." His voice was rough with emotion.

"Sorry for who? Me?" She laughed bitterly. "Thaddeus, the person you should be apologizing to is Mr. Hamilton. The man who just nearly died. Not me. We’re nothing to each other."

"Mr. Hamilton cared for you. The least you could do is be here for him when he needs you. I was here this time. What about next time? Luck won’t always be on his side."

Her voice cracked. "I just… wish I could stay with him. Take care of him."

Thaddeus’s chest tightened. His apology meant nothing to her.

It was worthless.

"Thad!"

Jareth’s voice cut through the tension. He shot Evadne a wary glance before gripping Thaddeus’s arm. "Outside. Now. We need to talk."
###Chapter 157

"Speak." Alexander's piercing gaze locked onto Isabella.

Nathaniel hesitated, unsure how to begin.

"Alex! Alex!"

A shrill voice echoed through the hallway, sending chills down Nathaniel's spine.

Olivia jolted awake, gripping Isabella's sleeve tightly.

"What's happening? Is Mr. Sinclair alright?"

"Relax, Olivia." Isabella shot a frosty glare at Victoria before reassuring her friend. "With me here, nothing will happen to Mr. Sinclair. Let's get you some rest. You'll see him as soon as he wakes."

Watching her walk away calmly, Alexander felt like his heart had been ripped out. The pain was suffocating.

"Alex!"

Victoria's eyes were puffy from crying. She lunged toward him but was blocked by Nathaniel.

"Ms. Sterling, you should be at the hospital with your father and finding a lawyer for your mother. That's what matters now."

Ignoring him, Victoria sobbed dramatically. "I've been framed! I'm the victim here! Alex, you have to believe me—I would never betray you!"

Alexander turned his back, jaw clenched. His expression was glacial.

Hearing her talk about love made him sick.

Nathaniel scoffed. "You're lucky Alex is merciful. If it were up to me, you and your lover would disappear. The Sterlings would be forced out of this city—permanently."

Victoria trembled under his cold stare.

After a long silence, Alexander finally faced her, his voice like ice. "Leave."

"No! I won't!"

Her tone still carried that manipulative sweetness, as if she thought he’d never truly cast her aside.

But Alexander had already texted Lawrence, who arrived with two bodyguards.

"Remove her. Now." His command was absolute.

Lawrence seized Victoria’s arm, dragging her toward the exit.

"There's nothing between me and Gregory! He forced me into a relationship! When I refused, he—he assaulted me! Got me pregnant!"

Desperate, Victoria spun wild lies. "He blackmailed me! Threatened to ruin my life if I didn’t comply! Alex, I’m a victim too! Why won’t you believe me?!"

"Victoria."

His voice was hollow, devoid of any warmth. "Our breakup has nothing to do with Gregory. Or your child."

She froze, bewildered.

"I wouldn’t have cared if you fell in love abroad. If you had a child with someone else."

His fists clenched, knuckles white. "But you lied. You faked depression to manipulate me. You used my mother’s suffering as a weapon to force me into marriage."

Her face paled. She’d made a fatal mistake.

She’d exploited the very trauma that haunted him—his mother’s battle with depression. And now, the lie had destroyed everything.

"You turned our pain into a game." His laugh was bitter. "You made me a fool."

Nathaniel cut in, disgusted. "You grew up with Alex. You knew what he went through. And yet you used it against him. That’s not love—that’s cruelty."

"Enough." Alexander couldn’t bear another second. "Lawrence, get her out of my sight. Permanently."

"Yes, sir!"

Victoria shrieked as she was hauled away. "You’re just using this as an excuse to leave me! You’re tired of me! You’re in love with Isabella now!"

Her voice turned venomous. "What’s so special about her? She never saved your life! She’s just using you!"

"Shut your mouth!" Alexander roared, eyes blazing. "You don’t get to speak her name. One more word, and I’ll ensure the Sterlings lose everything. Get. Out."

The fury in his voice shattered her. She collapsed, trembling, as Lawrence dragged her off.

Silence returned to the hallway.

"Alex." Nathaniel clapped his shoulder. "Congrats. No matter how long the deception lasted, it’s never too late to walk away."

"Never too late?" Alexander’s laugh was hollow.

To him, it already was.
###Chapter 158

The commotion drew every eye in the hospital corridor as Seraphina was forcibly dragged outside, her pride left in tatters at her feet.

But what did it matter? She'd already lost everything. A little more humiliation was nothing.

"Ah!"

Nathaniel and the bodyguard released her simultaneously, sending Seraphina sprawling onto the wet pavement.

"Hey, got a tissue?" Nathaniel asked, wiping his hands on his coat.

"Sorry, sir. Fresh out."

"Figures. Let's grab some sanitizer from the nurse's station. Can't be too careful after handling... well, you know."

With that, Nathaniel spat in her direction before turning on his heel, the bodyguard following without a backward glance.

The sky cracked open with a deafening roar, unleashing a torrential downpour as if the heavens themselves sought to cleanse the earth.

Seraphina sat motionless, battered by the storm and her own despair, too broken to even lift her head.

Her meticulously styled hair clung to her face in sodden strands, her makeup streaking down her cheeks like grotesque war paint.

"Sebastian... I saved your life! How could you betray me like this?!"

Her scream dissolved into a choked sob as she slammed her fist into a puddle, splattering muddy water across her ruined designer dress. A sharp pain shot through her hand—her manicure shattered, nails broken.

Then, the roar of an engine cut through the rain.

A sleek black Bentley pulled up abruptly, its tires sending a wave of filthy water crashing over her.

"Are you blind?! Watch where you're driving!"

Seraphina shrieked like a madwoman, her voice lost in the storm.

The driver stepped out first, shielding the rear door with an umbrella before opening it with practiced deference.

Dominic emerged, his expression unreadable as he took the umbrella from the drenched chauffeur.

Then, Adrian stepped out beside him, his cold gaze sweeping over the scene without interest.

The moment Seraphina recognized them, her rage turned to ice in her veins. The insults died on her tongue, leaving her gaping like a fish.

"Ms. Lockwood," Dominic drawled, eyeing her soaked form with disdain. "Your father isn't hospitalized here, is he? Seems you're crying at the wrong grave."

"Let's go," Adrian said, nudging his brother. "Arabella's waiting."

They strode past her without another glance.

"Arabella Vanderbilt!" Seraphina's voice rose to a hysterical pitch. "Why does everyone adore you while I'm left with nothing?! Even Sebastian abandoned me because of you!"

Lightning split the sky, illuminating her twisted expression.

"Mark my words, Arabella—I'll make sure you lose everything too!"

Inside the hospital room, Arabella gently brushed a strand of hair from Mari's forehead as the child slept, her breathing finally steady after the night's terror.

With a quiet sigh, Arabella rose and moved toward the door—only to freeze when she opened it.

Sebastian stood there, his tailored suit immaculate but his eyes hollow, defeated.

Her gaze dropped to his lapel.

A ruby-encrusted pin glinted back at her, mocking in its opulence.

She'd designed it herself—their first Valentine's Day after the wedding. Every detail, from the gem selection to the delicate filigree, had been crafted with love.

Just like the Ruby Enigma he'd commissioned for Seraphina.

Arabella's lips curled into a bitter smile.

How ironic that the man who'd once tossed her heart aside now wore her gift like some twisted trophy.

"Seraphina's gone," he said hoarsely. "She won't trouble you again."

"Congratulations," Arabella replied, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "Another woman neatly disposed of. Did she get her two million and a villa this time, or did you downgrade the payout?"

The words struck like a physical blow. Sebastian flinched, the memory of that damned divorce agreement flashing before him—her tear-stained signature, the way he'd walked out without a second thought.

That document still haunted his nightstand.

"I heard you bought time for Grandfather with your massage. Thank you."

"Don't. He's family to me too." She moved to leave, but he blocked her path.

"Even dogs know better than to stand in doorways," she snapped. "What's your excuse?"

"I want to make things right." His voice cracked. "Tell me how."

"Are you delusional? There's a psychiatric ward downstairs—maybe start there."

"I know I hurt you—"

"Stop." She held up a hand. "No more apologies. You loved Seraphina. You were loyal to her. There's no crime in that. The only mistake was mine—falling for the wrong man. But don't worry, Sebastian. I only make that mistake once."

Each word was a knife twisting in his chest.

She'd escaped the prison of her love for him.

He was the one still trapped, drowning in regret.

"Arabella!"

The call snapped her attention down the hall, where Dominic and Adrian approached.

Her face lit up as she rushed past Sebastian without hesitation.

"I'm starving," she declared, looping her arm through Dominic's. "Make me pancakes when we get home?"

"Me too!" Adrian chimed in, mimicking her pout.

Dominic chuckled. "Fine, you brats. Pancakes it is."

As their laughter faded down the corridor, Sebastian stood alone in the sudden silence, his world reduced to the ache in his chest.

Without him, she was surrounded by love.

Without her, he was just an empty shell.
###Chapter 159

Even after leaving the hospital, Isabella couldn't shake her worry for Mr. Sinclair's condition.

She needed to reach out to Olivia once she got home. The Lockwood family had generations of renowned physicians, their medical expertise unparalleled in the country. If anyone could find a cure for Mr. Sinclair, it would be them.

During the drive back, Daniel was glued to his phone, scrolling through social media. Every time he stumbled upon a particularly vicious comment about Victoria, he'd read it aloud to Isabella with glee.

"Damn, these trolls are savage! Normally, I'd find them insufferable, but today? Pure entertainment. Some of these burns are legendary—I'm screenshotting them!" Daniel cackled, wiping tears from his eyes as he scrolled through the vitriol.

Gazing out the window, Isabella's mind drifted to the gold cufflinks Alexander had worn that night. A wave of revulsion washed over her.

Every gift she'd ever given him now felt like a stain on her past.

She'd rather smash them to pieces than let them remain tied to Alexander in any way.

"Isabella." Sebastian's voice was soft as he rested a comforting hand on the nape of her neck. "Nathaniel has George and Miranda in custody at his office. Just got word—George cracked under questioning and confessed. Miranda, though? She's stonewalling. No matter what Nathaniel asks, she insists it was all her idea."

"Miranda may be ruthless, but she's still a mother."

Isabella pushed aside the tangled emotions Alexander had stirred in her. Her tone was crisp, detached. "With Mr. Kingsley critically ill and her eldest son behind bars, Victoria is her last hope. Of course she'd protect her at all costs."

This had been Isabella's plan from the start—luring Miranda out while setting an inescapable trap.

She'd sent Adrian to tail Miranda overseas. Despite her cunning, Miranda was just a spoiled socialite with no counter-surveillance skills. She never noticed Adrian shadowing her to the orphanage where she'd hidden her illegitimate granddaughter.

Adrian's report had been grim. The place was little better than a slum, the children filthy and neglected. The sight had sickened him. Women like Miranda and Victoria didn't deserve to breathe the same air as decent people.

Miranda had taken the girl from the orphanage, but she lacked the stomach for murder. Instead, she'd hired a desperate local woman to do the deed.

Luckily, Adrian intervened in time. Using Isabella's private jet, he'd brought the girl back to New York, where she was now safe under police protection.

"That child is Miranda's own flesh and blood—her granddaughter. And she tried to have her killed!"

Sebastian's eyes darkened with fury. "She never loved that girl. This was all a cold calculation, weighing risks and rewards. All she cares about is securing Victoria's place in high society."

Isabella nodded. "Exactly."

"Don't worry, Isabella. Nathaniel and I will make sure Miranda rots in prison. As for George?"

Daniel cracked his knuckles, a sinister grin spreading across his face. "He thinks jail is the end? Oh no. His nightmare is just beginning."

The birthday gala had turned the Kingsley empire upside down.

Alexander had been camped at the hospital with his grandfather, while Frederick and his wife were too embroiled in the scandal surrounding Miranda and Victoria to even visit. The fallout had consumed them entirely.

"Mr. Kingsley, the online backlash is getting worse. Should we have PR step in?" Adrian asked, concerned about the damage to Alexander's reputation.

Alexander sat slumped in the hospital hallway, his complexion ashen.

One knee drawn up, the other stretched out, his head leaned against the cold wall, the curve of his neck a portrait of desolation. Even in despair, he was breathtaking.

"Let them talk. They're not wrong."

Alexander closed his eyes, loosening his tie, but the suffocating weight remained. "I deserve this."

"Sir, don't say that."

Adrian swallowed hard. "You were deceived by Victoria too. You're a victim in this."

Victim.

Alexander's chest tightened. The only true victim he could think of was Isabella.

He had been Victoria's pawn, her weapon.

The harm he'd suffered came from Victoria—but hadn't Isabella suffered at his hands?

"Mr. Kingsley!"

A voice rang down the hallway. Sophia hurried toward him, arms laden with bags.

"Sophia?" Alexander stood quickly, taking the bags from her. "What are you doing here?"

"Adrian told me about Mr. Sinclair. I brought you some essentials—toiletries, a change of clothes. And snacks for you both."

She nudged Alexander back onto the bench and began unpacking containers of still-warm food.

"I'm not hungry. Let Adrian have it." Alexander stared at the steam rising from the containers, touched by the gesture.

But after everything, even with his resolve, his appetite was nonexistent.

"Not hungry either! Thanks though, Sophia!" Adrian shook his head vigorously. If the boss wasn't eating, neither would he.

"Eat. Both of you."

Sophia took one look at Alexander's exhausted face, grabbed a sandwich, and shoved it into his hands. "You're running yourself ragged over that fraud Victoria, skipping meals? Where's your self-respect? Don't make me lose respect for you!"

Alexander gave a wry smile, forcing himself to take a bite. "Who said it was about her?"

"Then why the long face? Is it about Mrs. Kingsley?" Sophia arched a brow.

Alexander flushed—whether from embarrassment or nearly choking, it was hard to say. "It's about my grandfather."

"Mr. Kingsley, since we're at the hospital, why not get a full check-up tomorrow?"

Sophia smirked. "Let's see if that stubborn pride of yours is the only thing that's hardened."

Adrian stifled a laugh behind his hand. Sophia had nerves of steel.

"Sophia."

Alexander's throat tightened, but his voice was ice. "I made mistakes. I hurt Isabella because of Victoria. But even without Victoria, I would've divorced her. Our marriage was arranged by my grandfather. There was never any love between us. No regrets."

"Three years. Three whole years, Mr. Kingsley! Mrs. Kingsley loved you with everything she had. Anyone with half a heart would've been moved by that. Are you telling me you felt nothing for her? Not even a little?" Sophia's voice was hoarse with intensity.

"I don't love Isabella."

Alexander's heart lurched. His lips were dry as he forced out each word. "But if I didn't love her... why did I marry her?"

The words hung heavy in the air. Adrian felt a pang of sorrow.

He knew Alexander cared for Isabella. He had to.

But the scars of his childhood—his mother's suicide, his family's cruelty, the betrayals by those he'd trusted—had left him unable to face his own emotions, to open his heart.

"Mr. Kingsley, admitting you were wrong doesn't make you weak. What's pride compared to happiness? If swallowing your ego means winning back Mrs. Kingsley, I'll help you do it!" Sophia exhaled sharply.

Alexander frowned. "Sophia—"

"Me too!" Adrian thrust his hand up. "I'll do whatever it takes!"

Alexander pinched the bridge of his nose.

"Oh! Almost forgot."

Sophia dug into her pocket and handed Alexander a small recorder. "Some guy showed up at my place tonight—said this was for you. Looked like he stepped out of a magazine."

Alexander took it, curious. "Who was he?"

"Claimed he worked for the Lockwoods."

Alexander and Adrian exchanged glances. Without hesitation, Alexander pressed play.
###Chapter 160

The Sterling family's downfall was swift and brutal. One moment they were swimming in wealth, the next they were drowning in scandal. The internet had a field day, turning them into a cautionary tale overnight.

Netizens joked that the Sterlings had single-handedly provided the public with a masterclass in legal disasters. They deserved an award for "public service through spectacular failure."

Una Sterling was now behind bars, charged with conspiracy to commit murder. Though she'd escape the death penalty, twenty years in prison meant she'd likely never see freedom again. At fifty, her life was effectively over.

Mr. Sterling hadn't fared much better. The stress triggered a massive heart attack. By the time he reached the ICU, the damage was irreversible. Oxygen deprivation left him in a vegetative state.

"Ms. Acacia, I'm sorry," the doctor said grimly. "The prognosis isn't good. Your father may never wake up."

Acacia stood frozen outside the ward, the words hitting her like a physical blow. Her face drained of color.

The Sterling Group was collapsing under mountains of debt. Creditors hounded her daily, forcing her to hide in cheap hotels. She'd burned through her savings just to hire a lawyer for her mother and keep her father on life support.

For the first time in her life, she understood what it meant to be truly desperate.

Then came the final blow.

Camille's studio sent representatives demanding compensation—five times the original cost of the dress Acacia had borrowed and ruined.

"Five times?!" Acacia shrieked, clutching the bill in trembling hands. "This is extortion!"

The assistant smirked. "Our clients pay millions for custom pieces. If you couldn't afford the responsibility, you shouldn't have borrowed it."

"You—how dare you speak to me like that?" Acacia's voice shook with rage.

"Pay within two weeks," the woman said coolly. "Or we'll sue."

With that, she left, her heels clicking against the floor like a death knell.

Acacia collapsed into a chair, sobbing uncontrollably. When the tears finally dried, she wiped her face with shaking hands. There was only one person left who could save her now.

Elspeth.

Her aunt had played a part in this disaster. She couldn't just abandon her now.

The Abernathy mansion was silent at dinner.

Hamilton's health had stabilized, but the tension at the table was suffocating. Thaddeus was present, but no one spoke.

Normally, Elspeth would be flirting shamelessly with Frederic, filling the room with false cheer. Tonight, she barely touched her food, stirring her soup absently.

Glynnis, however, ate with gusto.

"Slow down," Elspeth snapped. "You're getting fat."

Glynnis rolled her eyes. "An Abernathy doesn't need to worry about marriage prospects."

"Enough," Frederic said coldly.

Elspeth flinched. The Stirling scandal had nearly dragged the Abernathys down with it. If Acacia's crimes had come to light after the engagement announcement, the humiliation would have been unbearable.

"Ma'am," the butler interrupted. "Ms. Acacia is here. She insists on seeing you."

Elspeth's stomach twisted.

Frederic didn't look up from his plate. "See her out."

But Acacia wasn't leaving without a fight.

"Auntie!" she cried, latching onto Elspeth's arm the moment she stepped outside. "You have to help me! My mother—your own sister—is in prison!"

Elspeth yanked her arm free. "What did you expect? Hiring a hitman? She might as well have signed her own death warrant!"

"We had no choice! Evadne was closing in on us!"

"You idiots played right into her hands!" Elspeth hissed. "She barely lifted a finger, and you self-destructed!"

Acacia's grip tightened. "I need money. The debt collectors—"

"Money?" Elspeth laughed coldly. "The Sterlings are finished. Your brother's in jail, your father's a vegetable. You have nothing left."

Acacia's eyes darkened. "I've done everything you asked. Everything."

Elspeth went still.

"If you abandon me now," Acacia whispered, "I'll tell Frederic everything. How you used me to manipulate Thaddeus. How you drove his mother to suicide."

Elspeth's blood ran cold.

Acacia smiled, her voice dripping with venom. "We're family, Auntie. Don't make me burn us all."
###Chapter 161

Sweat beaded on Elspeth's forehead as she hurried back to the restaurant. Acacia, the girl she'd raised like her own, was now a ticking time bomb in her hands.

She hadn't been worried before—without solid proof, Acacia's words were just empty threats.

But now? Frederic had grown distant. One wrong move, and her standing in the Abernathy family would crumble. She needed to bail Acacia out without spending a dime of her own money. That meant playing the pitiful card with Frederic.

"Frederic," she began, voice trembling, "I know Acacia messed up, but she's still the girl you watched grow up. She was always so obedient before. Now, with my sister in jail, my brother in a coma, the Sterling Group drowning in debt—Acacia's terrified. Debt collectors hound her day and night. She's still family to me. How can I not ache for her?"

Elspeth placed a trembling hand over Frederic's tense one, tears welling. "You've always been generous. Let's help her through this, just this once. Consider it charity."

Frederic's expression softened slightly.

Then Thaddeus tossed a recorder onto the table.

"If you still want to help her," he said coldly, "listen to this first."

Elspeth's pulse spiked. What was this?

Frederic pressed play.

Two voices—George and Acacia.

"Don't touch Evadne yet. Wait for my signal. Things are looking up—Thaddeus trusts me again. He's been by my side these past few days. And Mr. Frederic approved our marriage. The engagement should happen soon."

"Since you've secured Thaddeus, what about that fifty thousand?"

"You're nagging over pocket change? Fine, I'll send five now. The rest after the engagement."

Silence.

Elspeth's face drained of color. She regretted every word she'd just spoken.

Acacia was an idiot. Leaving evidence before sealing the deal? She deserved every bit of her downfall.

"Is this the 'good girl' you raised?" Thaddeus's voice was ice.

"You should thank my ex-wife for stopping your niece's little scheme. If Evadne had been hurt, Acacia wouldn't just be in debt. I'd make sure she suffered."

Elspeth inhaled sharply.

She'd underestimated him. She thought Thaddeus, like his father, would cling to sentiment. That years of history with Acacia would make him hesitate.

But no. His affection had vanished overnight.

"Acacia sees me and this family as stepping stones and ATMs," Thaddeus continued, standing. "Who's to say she won't waste this money on something reckless?"

He wiped his mouth, gaze cutting. "If you want to donate, Mr. Frederic, there are orphanages and schools in need. Why throw money at a schemer?"

With that, he left.

Elspeth shivered.

Frederic pulled his hand away. "Thaddeus is right. The Sterlings dug their own grave. We've helped enough. No more."

He stormed off.

Glynnis chewed her steak, unfazed. "Why help her? She deserves this."

"Shut up!" Elspeth hurled a bread roll at her.

She'd have to dip into her own funds now. The thought made her chest tighten.

Later, Thaddeus drove to Havenbrook alone.

Even with Acacia dealt with, his mood remained heavy.

He'd always prided himself on perfection—running the Abernathy Group flawlessly.

Yet somehow, he'd failed at everything.

Marriage. Family.

A memory surfaced—someone praising Evadne: "She handled Mr. Hamilton like a pro! I never knew she had medical training. She's as skilled as his private doctor!"

His grip tightened on the wheel.

He should've noticed sooner.

She'd saved his grandfather. Treated a waiter's seizure. Even before the divorce, her massages had eased his migraines.

She'd done so much. Played the perfect wife.

So why had he found her irritating? Why had he dismissed her strengths, blinded by resentment?

His chest ached.

Looking back, Acacia was his biggest mistake.

And to Evadne, he was probably no better than Acacia.

At Havenbrook, Hamilton waited eagerly.

He'd always doted on Thaddeus—why else push him as CEO against all objections?

"Grandpa, how are you feeling? Any discomfort?" Thaddeus knelt by his wheelchair. "Come stay at Windermere. Alva and I can care for you."

Hamilton scoffed. "And shorten my lifespan? That woman Elspeth is a headache!"

Thaddeus chuckled.

Mr. Murray smiled. "You stay here because this villa holds your wife's presence. You can't bear to leave."

Hamilton's gaze grew distant. "Sometimes... I see her in the garden. Singing. Watering the flowers. She even smiles at me."

Thaddeus's throat tightened.

He remembered his grandparents' love. Had wanted that for himself.

Instead, he'd clung to Acacia—forcing a mismatch, ignoring the red flags, terrified of being alone.

And in the process, he'd shattered a heart as bright as a diamond.

"Grandpa," he whispered, voice breaking. "I'm sorry."

Hamilton sighed, patting his shoulder. "You're as stubborn as I was. But I was luckier—I found the right person. At least you woke up before it was too late."

Then, sternly: "Mr. Murray, compile a list tomorrow. All the eligible bachelors worthy of Evadne. She's divorced, but that shouldn't limit her future!"

Thaddeus's fist clenched.

The image of Avery offering Evadne roses under a sunset flashed in his mind.

His chest burned.

After chatting, Thaddeus left.

"Sir," Mr. Murray asked, puzzled, "I thought you wanted them back together?"

Hamilton smirked. "Men are possessive. Threaten what they take for granted, and they'll realize what they truly want."

Finally, the storm had passed.
###Chapter 162

The domino effect Evadne triggered with the insignificant pawn George led to the complete downfall of the Sterling family.

Though the Abernathy family suffered collateral damage, Thaddeus ultimately didn’t marry Acacia. He became another victim in this mess, his reputation dragged through the mud, making him the talk of Elmsworth.

In the General Manager’s office at K Hotel.

Evadne squeezed in a couple of mobile games while Jason peeled grapes for her, simultaneously briefing her on important updates.

"Aaron sent word—Una’s trial is about to begin. No lawyer is willing to defend her. The evidence is airtight, and no one wants to take on a losing battle. A twenty-year sentence is practically guaranteed."

Jason leaned over, feeding her a plump, translucent grape.

She savored it, licking her lips with satisfaction. "So sweet!"

Jason chuckled.

"Aaron could’ve called me himself, but he made you relay the message." Evadne sighed, a hint of disappointment in her voice.

Aaron and Nydia were alike—both overthinkers.

Though only three years older than her, Aaron had cared for her since childhood with the same devotion as her other brothers.

"Aaron has a bit of an inferiority complex. He can’t bring himself to openly spoil you," Jason remarked, well-versed in the Ashbourne family dynamics.

"He always overthinks."

Evadne shook her head. "In my heart, he’s no different from Cassius. I love and admire them equally."

"By the way, George is rotting in jail now. Arnold and Aaron teamed up to crack down on underground gambling dens and loan sharks. A few of those scumbags are locked up with him."

Jason clenched his jaw, eyes icy. "George can take his sweet time repaying his debts behind bars."

Evadne smirked. "My brothers are so thoughtful. I’ll have to cook them a feast as thanks."

"Also, the Sterling family’s debt is nearly cleared."

Evadne paused, brows knitting. "Did Thaddeus bail them out? He’s really devoted to the Sterlings."

"No. It was Elspeth."

Evadne fell silent.

"But it’s strange. Acacia’s reputation is in ruins—she’s useless now. Elspeth isn’t a saint either. Why would she clean up the Sterlings’ mess?" Jason voiced his confusion.

"Even if Acacia is useless, she might have dirt on Elspeth."

Evadne’s tone turned frigid. "They’ve been scheming together for years. Do you think Acacia doesn’t know any of Elspeth’s secrets? As you said, Elspeth isn’t a philanthropist. She’s being blackmailed into filling the Sterling Group’s financial hole."

"Serves her right!"

Jason peeled another grape and handed it to Evadne. "I heard Acacia paid the hospital bill and fled abroad to avoid the scandal. Doubt she’ll dare show her face in Elmsworth anytime soon. That poor little girl was completely abandoned. As per your instructions, I sent her to the Ashbourne-sponsored welfare home. She’s adjusting well, so you needn’t worry."

"What a shame." Evadne swallowed the grape.

"Huh?"

"It’s a shame Acacia and Thaddeus didn’t end up together. They’re both selfish, cold-hearted monsters—they deserve to be shackled together for life."

Just as Evadne exited the game, a friend request popped up from a player named Rose, with an impressively high level.

As a gaming legend, she received countless friend requests daily. But the username "Rose" intrigued her, so she accepted.

Rose messaged immediately: [Want to play together?]

Cifer: [About to log off. Maybe next time.]

Rose: [Then, how about coffee at K Hotel?]

Minutes later, Evadne arrived at the third-floor café.

The place was nearly empty. Avery sat by the window, the golden sunset casting a halo around his tall frame, making him impossible to miss.

"Mr. Avery."

Evadne approached, surprised. "When did you get back? Why didn’t you tell me?"

"Didn’t want to disturb your work. I just got back and had nothing to do, so I thought I’d wait here."

Avery smiled, waving his phone. "Then I logged into the game and saw you online. Figured I’d shoot my shot."

"What would you like to drink? My treat."

His thoughtfulness made her feel oddly guilty, as if she owed him an apology.

"I’ve already had three coffees. Not thirsty, but I’m starving."

Avery adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses, his smile disarmingly genuine. "President Ashbourne, may I sample the cuisine at your esteemed hotel? Been in Helgen for years—I’ve missed authentic Elmsworth flavors."

Knowing he’d waited so long, she couldn’t refuse. "Of course. My treat."

She had Jason reserve a private dining room and ordered the chef’s signature dishes.

Over dinner, their conversation flowed effortlessly, laughter filling the room.

Outside, Jason leaned against the wall, unease gnawing at him as Evadne’s bright laughter drifted through the door.

He despised Thaddeus.

And Avery? Jason didn’t trust him either.

Some people, you just knew instinctively—you’d never be friends. Your gut screamed warnings from the start.

Though Jason adored Evadne, he wasn’t the jealous type. He didn’t resent men who interacted with her.

But Avery’s ever-present smile felt like a mask. Unreadable. Unpredictable. Even Evadne couldn’t anticipate his sudden appearances.

Too hard to guard against.

"The head chef here is incredible. This meal was perfect—all thanks to you," Avery said, satisfied.

"Thank you. I’ve been meaning to treat you, especially after you saved me," Evadne replied sincerely.

Avery tilted his head slightly, his smile turning playful. "Ms. Evadne, surely saving your life is worth more than just dinner?"

Evadne blinked.

Then, two concert tickets materialized before her.

"Christina’s debut piano recital is tonight at seven. Join me?" Avery’s grin was irresistible.

Evadne hesitated.

Sensing her reluctance, Avery leaned in, his voice low and coaxing.

"Ms. Evadne, you wouldn’t deny your lifesaver such a small request, would you?"

In the president’s office at Abernathy Group.
###Chapter 163

The leather chair creaked as Thaddeus leaned back, his sharp features shadowed by exhaustion. Another high-stakes meeting had drained him, leaving behind only the weight of unspoken tensions.

Across Elmsworth, whispers about Acacia had undoubtedly spread through the Abernathy Group’s labyrinth of power. But within those glass-walled offices, no one dared voice a word—not unless they had a death wish.

As Vice-Chairman of the Board, Thaddeus commanded fear. Respect. Yet tonight, his mood was anything but victorious.

“Elspeth actually pulled it off,” Gordon mused, satisfaction curling his lips. “Who knew she had the resources to bail out the Stirling Group? Let her bleed money for once.”

Thaddeus’s fingers drummed against the armrest. “Earl managed her finances before his imprisonment. If she can still throw millions around, she’s got backup channels.” His voice was ice. “Moonlit Treasures isn’t just a boutique.”

Gordon blinked. “You’re saying that little shop is laundering money?”

A folded paper airplane sailed through the air, hitting Gordon square in the chest. “Think bigger. Moonlit Treasures is a front. Behind it? A web of Elmsworth’s underground elite. Connections. Favors. Power trades hands there—not just handbags.”

Gordon paled. “We underestimated her.”

“Never underestimate the enemy.” Thaddeus’s smile was razor-thin. “But dismantling her empire takes time. She’s entrenched. Protected. And Frederic’s shadow looms large.”

“She’ll fall eventually.”

Thaddeus exhaled, shifting gears. “Ada’s project?”

“Our wedding proposal’s ready for her team.” Gordon hesitated. “Sir, why not gift the hosting rights to K World Hotel? It’d make Mrs. Abernathy happy.”

Thaddeus’s gaze turned glacial. “I owe Evadne a favor. Not the Ashbourne Group.”

Gordon swallowed. Business was war, and Thaddeus never surrendered an advantage.

The phone buzzed. Jareth’s name flashed on the screen.

“What?” Thaddeus snapped.

“Christina’s concert tonight! Front-row seats—let’s go!” Jareth’s enthusiasm was met with silence. “Oh, come on. Don’t tell me Acacia’s betrayal has you moping.”

“Hang up.”

“Wait! Edith’s performing. She’s back from abroad.”

Thaddeus paused. Edith—Jareth’s sister, the girl he’d watched grow up. “Fine. Pick me up.”

Elmsworth National Concert Hall glittered under the night sky.

Jareth fussed with a camera in their private box, determined to capture Edith’s debut. “This’ll be priceless!”

Thaddeus scoffed. “The professionals are recording it.”

“Not the same!” Jareth adjusted the lens—then froze. “Wait. Is that Evadne?”

Thaddeus was on his feet in an instant.

Across the hall, Evadne laughed beside a pale, elegant man—Avery Chambers. Their intimacy was a blade twisting in Thaddeus’s gut.

Avery knelt, draping his jacket over her bare legs. “Cold?”

Evadne’s smile was radiant. “You’re too kind.”

“Your dress is stunning. Like a siren’s lure.” His admiration was shameless, his touch lingering.

Thaddeus’s knuckles whitened on the railing. The pain in his chest was unbearable.

“Who is that guy?” Jareth muttered.

“Avery Chambers. Jeff’s youngest son.”

Jareth whistled. “The Chambers heir? Competition’s heating up.” He smirked at Thaddeus. “So? Retreat or fight?”

“Shut. Up.”

The lights dimmed. The concert began.

But Thaddeus saw nothing but Evadne—and the man who might’ve already stolen her heart.
###Chapter 164

The concert began.

Christina, the renowned pianist, glided onto the stage in a deep blue velvet gown. She settled gracefully before the grand piano, ready to enchant the audience with her signature piece, Whispers of Eternity.

The melody wrapped around the hall like a spell, silencing every whisper.

Though the music was mesmerizing, Evadne's attention lingered on Christina's dress.

That exquisite, one-of-a-kind creation was designed by Haron—the alias Evadne herself used in the fashion world.

Only the elite of international stardom could commission a Haron original.

Thaddeus clenched his fists, his knuckles white.

His simmering rage burned hotter as he watched Evadne's serene profile.

Avery leaned in occasionally, murmuring something that made her lips curve. Her eyes sparkled with quiet amusement, as if his words were the most fascinating thing she'd ever heard.

Thaddeus's jaw tightened.

Why did she have so much to say to him?

In three years of marriage, she'd never looked at him like that.

"Damn, why's it so cold in here?" Jareth muttered, rubbing his arms.

After several pieces, Christina introduced her star pupil, Edith.

The young woman stepped forward, her chestnut curls cascading over a delicate green chiffon dress embroidered with blossoms. She was radiant, poised—every inch the rising star.

"Edith! Over here! Your big brother's watching!" Jareth called, waving like an overexcited fan.

Thaddeus shot him a glare that could freeze lava.

Edith, oblivious, bowed gracefully before taking her seat at the piano. Her fingers danced over the keys, bringing Mozart's Turkish March to life.

Evadne watched, her left hand resting on her knee. Her fingers twitched faintly, mirroring the melody from muscle memory.

That damaged little finger almost felt alive again.

"You used to play beautifully," Avery murmured. "If you'd pursued music, you'd have outshone her."

"Not possible now." Evadne curled her fingers into a fist. "I'll never play like that again."

Years ago, on Zenithia's battlefield, she'd torn the ligaments in her left hand dragging Thaddeus to safety. The numbness in her pinky was permanent.

Countless hours of rehab had barely restored function to the other fingers.

But she didn't regret saving him.

Even after everything, they'd once fought side by side for peace.

Her scars weren't shadows—they were medals.

The concert ended with thunderous applause. Christina and Edith took their bows, accepting bouquets and cheers.

"Ms. Evadne," Avery said, offering his arm. "Would you accompany me backstage?"

"Is this about the autograph for your mother?"

He nodded. "Christina's notoriously selective, but I'd like to try."

Evadne smirked. "Good luck charming her."

Jareth, bursting with pride, hauled Thaddeus backstage with a massive bouquet.

The corridor narrowed as two groups collided.

Evadne froze mid-step.

Avery stiffened. "My apologies. I didn't realize he'd be here. We can leave."

"Don't worry about it." She shrugged. "No law says I have to avoid my ex. Besides, your mother deserves that autograph."

Avery's gaze softened.

Thaddeus's face turned to stone.

They were close enough for every word to slice through him.

He'd spent the entire concert swallowing fury. Now, hearing her care about Avery's mother? It took every ounce of control not to demand how far their relationship had gone.

But why should he care?

They were divorced.

Yet here he was, heart pounding, desperate to close the distance between them.

A door swung open.

"Thaddeus!"

A green blur launched at him before he could react. Edith clung to him, nuzzling his chest. "You came just for me, didn't you? Were you trying to surprise me?"

Thaddeus went rigid, his eyes darting to Evadne.

Jareth chuckled, oblivious. "Hey, what about your real brother?"

Edith ignored him, pressing closer. "Jareth's too wild. I prefer you—fresh and handsome. Exactly my type."

Thaddeus turned his face away, but not fast enough.

Evadne was already walking toward them.

Her pearl-bright eyes met his.

His breath caught.
###Chapter 165

Isabella Sinclair lifted her delicate chin just a fraction, her piercing gaze locking onto Nathaniel Kingsley as she strode toward him.

Instantly, the man felt his pulse skyrocket, his throat constricting, every muscle beneath his tailored suit coiling tight. It was as if her presence alone had electrified his nerves, pulling him toward her with an irresistible force.

Beside him, Evelyn Prescott's grip on his arm tightened, her nails digging in unconsciously. A surge of possessiveness twisted inside her chest.

She didn’t need words to understand—this stunning woman wasn’t just familiar to Nathaniel. She mattered to him.

But just as Nathaniel braced himself, expecting Isabella to stop before him, she breezed past without a second glance.

"Christian!" Her voice, bright and melodic, carried down the corridor as she greeted the world-renowned pianist with a radiant smile.

"Oh, my darling!"

Christian Delacroix, emerging from the opposite end, lit up like the sun. She embraced Isabella as if reuniting with a cherished friend, even using an affectionate nickname that spoke volumes of their closeness.

The entire hallway froze in shock—especially Evelyn.

Christian was notoriously distant, a woman who rarely spared smiles, let alone warmth. During Evelyn’s three years studying under her, praise had been scarce, and indifference the norm.

So who was this woman who could effortlessly draw such rare affection from her mentor?

"Sweetheart, I had no idea you were in Elmsworth! Had I known, I would’ve cleared my schedule for dinner!" Christian squeezed Isabella’s hands, beaming.

"I didn’t want to interrupt your rehearsals," Isabella replied smoothly.

She knew Christian under her designer alias, having crafted multiple custom gowns for the pianist. Their private rapport was strong—Isabella had a gift for turning professional connections into genuine friendships.

Nathaniel watched, his broad shoulders tensing, memories flooding his mind like a dam breaking.

He remembered the early days of their marriage, when Isabella’s eyes had sparkled just as brightly for him. She’d chatter excitedly about her day, her art, her music—full of life, full of love.

And he’d ignored her.

He’d dismissed her as dull, comparing her unfairly to Victoria, convinced marrying her had been a mistake.

But the truth? His cold neglect had suffocated her light. He’d molded her into a shadow of herself, silent and contained, until she’d finally broken free.

"Mr. Lockwood!"

Isabella’s voice snapped him back to the present. Her gaze flickered past Nathaniel, landing on Sebastian Lockwood. She waved him over, her smile effortless.

"I’m coming."

Sebastian adjusted his tie, his usual composure slipping just slightly as he strode toward her.

Nathaniel’s fists clenched, pain lancing through his chest. Beside him, Harrison Prescott looked equally sour, their expressions dark as storm clouds.

As Sebastian passed Nathaniel, he paused. Pushing his glasses up with one elegant finger, he turned his head—just enough to meet Nathaniel’s eyes.

The smirk that curled his lips was pure, unapologetic triumph.

Nathaniel’s heart shattered.

He could only watch, powerless, as Sebastian joined Isabella’s side, as they laughed with Christian, as the world moved on without him.

Was this really how it ended?

Was he truly just a spectator in her life now?

"This is my dear friend," Isabella introduced Sebastian warmly. "His mother adores your work. He was hoping for a signed record as a keepsake for her."

"Absolutely! It would be my pleasure."

Christian, ever gracious, not only obliged but summoned her manager to snap a photo of the three of them.

The moment was flawless.

So flawless it left Nathaniel hollow, his blood turning to acid in his veins.

Outside the concert hall, Evelyn clung to Nathaniel’s arm, chattering nonstop about her time abroad, her voice dripping with saccharine nostalgia.

The only difference from childhood? Harrison now trailed behind them like a disgruntled pack mule, ignored and scowling.

Isabella had dumped him. Evelyn was too wrapped up in Nathaniel to spare him a glance.

He was starting to question his entire existence.

In the parking lot, Nathaniel suddenly stopped. With deliberate force, he extracted his arm from Evelyn’s grip.

"Nathaniel?" She blinked up at him, her hand hovering midair, wounded.

"Evelyn." His voice was ice. "You’re an adult now. This behavior isn’t appropriate anymore."

"What’s inappropriate about a sister holding her brother’s hand?" she protested, her lower lip trembling.

"Harrison is your brother. I’m not." He left it at that, unwilling to spell out the awkward truth.

Evelyn’s eyes welled with tears, but beneath the surface, fury simmered.

This sudden distance—it was because of her, wasn’t it?

Victoria had finally been pushed aside. Evelyn had rushed back from abroad, determined to claim Nathaniel for herself.

She wouldn’t let some random woman steal what she’d coveted for years.

"You’re being cruel," she whispered.

Harrison, ever the doting brother, swooped in to console her. "Come on, Nate. You’ve known Evelyn since she was in pigtails. Holding hands isn’t a big deal. It’s not like you’re dating anyone."

"Evelyn should save her affection for a boyfriend," Nathaniel said flatly. An image of Isabella flashed in his mind. "And I’ll save mine for the woman I love."

Isabella slid into her Rolls-Royce, the door shutting with a quiet thud.

Achoo!

She sneezed, rubbing her nose. The concert hall’s AC must’ve been too cold.

"Miss Sinclair, should I prepare medicine when we return?" Olivia Bennett fretted, handing her a tissue.

Isabella waved her off. "I’m fine. Probably just someone talking trash about me."

"Running into Nathaniel tonight—ugh. What rotten luck," Olivia grumbled, taking the used tissue.

Isabella’s mood dimmed slightly.

The way Evelyn had clung to him, the way he’d allowed it…

She’d known Evelyn was Harrison’s sister. But she hadn’t realized Nathaniel was so close to her.

A bitter laugh escaped her. Three years of marriage, and she’d barely scratched the surface of that man.

"Disgusting," she muttered.

"Miss?"

"Nothing. Just cleansing my aura after that encounter." She crossed her arms and leaned back, eyes closing.

Her phone buzzed. Sebastian Lockwood’s name flashed on the screen.

"Sebastian?"

"Don’t make plans after work the day after tomorrow. I’ll pick you up from the hotel. We’re going to Skyrim."

"Skyrim? Is Father okay?" Her pulse spiked.

"He’s fine," Sebastian reassured her. "Mr. Jeff is visiting with his sons. Father wants all of us there. They’ve been friends for decades—he won’t tolerate any empty seats at the table."

Isabella exhaled. "Understood."
###Chapter 166

The night was mercilessly cold, the moon hanging like a frozen disc in the starless sky.

The Maybach rolled to a stop outside Windermere Estate. Thaddeus stepped out alone, his voice clipped as he dismissed the driver. "Go back. I'll walk from here."

"But Mr. Thaddeus," Gordon protested, eyeing the darkening clouds, "there's a storm coming. It's a long way to the villa—"

"I said no."

His tone left no room for argument. Gordon hesitated but finally nodded, watching through the rearview mirror as Thaddeus disappeared into the shadows.

The first raindrops hit just as Thaddeus started toward the mansion.

By the time he reached the grand doors, he was drenched. The icy downpour had seeped into his bones, matching the chill in his chest.

"Good heavens!" Alva gasped, rushing forward. "Where's the car? Where's Gordon?"

Thaddeus didn't answer. Water dripped from his hair, his clothes clinging to his frame. His lips trembled slightly, his eyes glazed with something raw.

"Alva," he rasped. "Bring me a drink."

"You're soaked to the skin! You'll catch your death!" She clucked her tongue. "Let me get you some hot soup—"

"Wine. Now."

Alva paused, studying him. "What happened?"

His throat worked. "I saw Evadne tonight."

"Mrs. Abernathy?" Her face brightened—until his next words.

"She's with someone else."

Alva's brows shot up. "Who?"

"A boyfriend." The words scraped out like broken glass.

For a moment, Alva just stared. Then she sighed. "Well, of course she is. A woman like her? She'd have suitors lined up around the block."

Thaddeus flinched.

"So," Alva said slowly, "you're standing here, half-drowned, because your ex-wife moved on?"

"I don't know." He dragged a hand through his wet hair.

"Listen to me." She gripped his shoulders. "If you're just jealous because she's happy without you, get over it. But if you still want her—fight for her. At least try."

Try?

The idea lodged in his chest like a knife. Every denial made it twist deeper.

Meanwhile, across town, Edith was playing hostess.

She'd returned from Aetheria with one goal: Thaddeus. And now that he was single again, she was ready to strike.

Today's pawn? Glynnis Abernathy.

"Oh, darling!" Edith gushed as Glynnis arrived, arms laden with gifts. "You shouldn't have!"

Glynnis simpered. "Just some little things from my trip. I hope you—and your brother—like them."

Edith's smile sharpened. "Speaking of Jareth..."

Right on cue, Jareth descended the staircase, impeccably dressed.

Glynnis nearly drooled.

"Jareth!" Edith trilled. "Look what Glynnis brought you!"

His expression frosted over at the sight of Glynnis. "What are you doing here?"

"Edith invited me," Glynnis squeaked.

Jareth's gaze cut to his sister. "Choose better friends."

Edith rolled her eyes. "Relax. If you're so worried, introduce me to that Evadne woman. You seem obsessed with her."

Jareth's jaw tightened. He snatched the gift box and strode out—only to toss it to his secretary.

"For me?" she blinked.

"It's a tie clip."

"I don't wear ties."

"Then sell it," Jareth snapped, and slammed the car door.
###Chapter 167

Jareth had vanished without a trace. His mother was still abroad, recuperating, with no sign of returning anytime soon. Glynnis's carefully laid plans to win over her future mother-in-law had crumbled—for now.

Still, the memory of Jareth accepting her gift sent her heart soaring. She doubted she'd get a wink of sleep tonight, too giddy with excitement.

That afternoon, Jareth and Edith lounged beneath the sprawling maple tree in the Jareth family's backyard, savoring the crisp autumn air and indulging in afternoon tea.

"When did you meet Evadne, Edith?" Glynnis fidgeted nervously, her dislike for Evadne simmering just beneath the surface.

"At my mentor's music concert the other day." Edith took a leisurely sip of her coffee, then arched a brow. "Sounds like you and Evadne have some... history?"

"History? I can't stand her!" Glynnis spat.

"That bad?"

"Edith, you've been away too long. You don't know half of it." Glynnis's voice dripped with venom. "Evadne is like some demon that crawled out of nowhere, wreaking havoc and making both our brothers dance to her tune! Because of her, the Abernathy family is in complete chaos!"

"What? My brother is interested in her?" Edith's eyes darkened.

"That witch has Jareth wrapped around her finger! She's a master manipulator, a real seductress!" Glynnis's face flushed crimson with rage. "Thankfully, they're not as close now. I bet she's already moved on to her next victim."

"My brother isn't some easy conquest. He's always been the one calling the shots, not the other way around." Edith scoffed. "Evadne was just a passing fling. He'd never seriously fall for someone like her. I know him better than anyone."

Noticing Glynnis's distress, Edith softened her tone. "But you're different, Glynnis. Our families have always been close. With me by your side, you'll win him over."

"Edith! You're a lifesaver!" Glynnis nearly wept with gratitude, clinging to Edith like a lifeline.

"So, what's the deal with Evadne and Thaddeus?"

That was the real question burning in Edith's mind.

"Ugh, don't even get me started!" Glynnis seethed. "She's his ex-wife!"

"What?!" Edith shot to her feet, her expensive teacup shattering on the ground. "Ex-wife? That's impossible! Thaddeus broke up with Acacia—he was never married. How could he have an ex-wife?"

"You didn't know? They had a secret marriage, officiated by my grandfather. They only divorced recently."

Seeing Edith's obvious crush on Thaddeus, Glynnis embellished the truth. "They're divorced, but he still has feelings for her. Acacia threw tantrums over it, but she couldn't make him let go of Evadne completely! And honestly, can you blame him? That witch has him under her spell!"

Edith's blood boiled.

No wonder Thaddeus had been practically drooling over Evadne that day!

Acacia had wasted over a decade on him and gotten nothing. What made Evadne so special? What right did she have?

Jealousy twisted Edith's heart. She clenched her fists. "Glynnis, you wouldn't mind if I became your sister-in-law, would you?"

Glynnis's eyes widened.

This girl really didn't hold back!

"Of course not! Compared to that cold-hearted Acacia, I'd much rather have you as my brother's wife!" Glynnis declared without hesitation.

"Since we both have clear goals, why not form an alliance?" Edith leaned in, her hands gripping Glynnis's shoulders. "I'll help you win my brother. You help me marry Thaddeus. Deal?"

"Edith, you know my family situation. Thaddeus and I are only half-siblings—we're not close like you and Jareth. I'm not sure how much help I can be..."

"But Frederic and Elspeth adore you. You can feed me information, be my inside woman." Edith's eyes gleamed with determination. "Together, we can take Evadne down. The benefits outweigh the risks!"

The moment Glynnis heard "take Evadne down," she was all in. "Deal! Let's see how that little witch struts around then!"

Edith crossed her arms, a smug grin spreading across her face.

From childhood, she'd been spoiled rotten by her mother and brother. She rubbed shoulders with royalty, collected international awards like they were candy. The spotlight had always been hers.

She never lost. She never settled.

"I'm saving my hand for my woman."

This time, she wouldn't let Thaddeus slip away. She would marry him.

His hand belonged to her.

Time flew, and soon it was time to return to Skyrim.

12:08 PM

To make it back in time for dinner, Evadne had been buried in work all day—approving documents, attending meetings, finalizing wedding plans. She was swamped.

But the results were worth it.

Under her leadership, Ada Ang's wedding plans were finally complete after ten grueling days and sleepless nights!

When Evadne gave the final "approved," the team erupted in cheers, their joy rivaling that of receiving a year-end bonus.

Working with Evadne demanded both mental and physical stamina—anyone weaker would've dropped out midway.

Yet, no one quit. No one gave up.

Despite her high status, Evadne was hands-on. Though an Ashbourne heiress, she never acted pretentious. She worked just as hard as everyone else, ensuring the team was well-fed with endless coffee and snacks.

A perfectionist with sky-high standards, she was also brilliant at problem-solving. Whenever the team hit a wall, she always had a solution ready, earning their admiration.

"Everyone, you've worked tirelessly these past weeks. Take three days off to recharge. Then grab some lavish buffet coupons from Food Services—my treat. I've been too busy lately to organize a dinner, but once we wrap up Ada Ang's project, bonuses, vacations, and even that overseas trip you've been dreaming of are on the table."

Evadne leaned against the oval conference table, her smile warm. "I'll foot the bill for all of it. And I never joke about these things."

"Thank you, President Ashbourne!" The room erupted in cheers.

Even though the goal wasn't reached yet, Evadne's promise filled them with anticipation.

The meeting ended at 5 PM.

"Ms. Evadne, your dinner dress is ready in the changing room. Would you like to change now?" Jason asked softly as he followed her.

"No need. Mr. Jeff watched me grow up. He and Emeric are old friends—he's seen me at my worst."

As the clock ticked closer to dinner, Evadne and Jason headed for the executive elevator.

Descending, she adjusted her hair in the mirrored doors, then carefully applied a swipe of lipstick—the final touch that brought her whole look to life.

Jason watched silently, a faint smile tugging at his lips.

Who knew the formidable Ms. Evadne had such a girlish side?

Lost in thought, neither noticed the elevator reaching the ground floor.

Ding.

The doors slid open.

A familiar scent of violets enveloped them—warm, deep, intoxicating.

Only one man carried that fragrance.

Sure enough, Evadne looked up to meet Avery's intense gaze.

Her breath hitched. Her hand trembled. The lipstick smudged, leaving a bright red streak.

Avery's lips curved into a faint, affectionate smile as he took in her startled expression.

"Ms. Evadne," he murmured, voice low. "I'm here to take you home."
###Chapter 168

Evadne's eyes widened in shock. "What are you doing here?"

Behind her, Jason's heart plummeted at the sight of Avery's sudden appearance. His fingers curled into tight fists.

"They said this elevator was reserved for you," Avery replied smoothly, his lips curving into a soft smile. "So I waited."

"That's not what I meant." Her brow furrowed. "Why are you looking for me?"

"Isn't my father dining at your place tonight? Aren't you heading back to Skyrim?" He chuckled, the sound low and effortless. "I came to pick you up. Let's go together."

Evadne pressed her lips together, suspicion flickering in her gaze.

His words made sense—but something felt off.

"Thanks for the offer, but Ca**ius already arranged to take me home. He should be here soon." She maintained a polite smile. "I'll see you tonight at Silverlake Harbor."

Avery shrugged. "I already told him I'd be picking you up. He agreed, so he won't be coming."

"What?" Evadne stiffened.

"We're old friends. Your father and mine are close, and you and I grew up together." His tone was light, almost teasing. "He shouldn't have any reason to worry about me taking you home."

Though what he really wanted was to whisk her away, keep her close, spoil her, protect her—make her his.

"Well, you really went out of your way."

Evadne kept her voice cool, maintaining distance.

Ca**ius, who usually hovered over her like a mother hen, had just handed her off to another man without a second thought?

Was he trying to pawn her off, just like Emeric?

Reckless. What if Avery was dangerous? What if he had issues?

She exhaled silently. Maybe she was just paranoid. After all, he had saved her life.

"It's no trouble. I always have time for you." His smile deepened.

Evadne ignored the suggestive tone and walked beside him.

"Ms. Evadne!" Jason's voice cracked behind them.

They paused.

She turned, eyebrows raised. "Yes, Jason?"

Avery adjusted his **es, his dark eyes narrowing slightly as he glanced back at Jason.

The younger man flinched under that icy stare, his throat tightening. "Ms. Evadne, I—"

"Oh, right. You don’t need to follow me tonight." She softened. "Go home and rest. You've been working nonstop."

Then she and Avery moved on, leaving Jason standing there, shoulders slumped.

That look Avery had given him—cold, calculating—sent a shiver down his spine. Like being locked in a pitch-black cellar, fear creeping in.

As Evadne and Avery crossed the lobby, whispers erupted.

"Look! Ms. Evadne's with someone new! Finally, a man who isn't Jason!"

"Damn, he's gorgeous. Jason's got competition."

"Different styles. This guy's like a brooding aristocrat. Jason's the golden retriever type."

"I prefer Jason!"

"The mysterious one’s hotter!"

"Why choose? I’d take both!"

Outside, Avery’s sleek black car waited. His secretary opened the door, but just as Evadne moved to step in, Avery caught her wrist.

"Ms. Evadne."

She turned, startled.

His gaze was warm, almost tender. He pulled a crisp white handkerchief from his pocket and reached for her lips.

This time, she didn’t let him. She snatched the cloth from his hand.

"I can do it myself."

Avery’s smile didn’t falter, but his eyes dimmed slightly.

The Bentley pulled away.

Across the street, the tinted window of a black Lamborghini slid down, revealing Thaddeus’s sharp profile.

His jaw was clenched, his usually composed eyes tinged with red. He watched the Bentley disappear, his pulse erratic.

The image of Evadne and Avery side by side sent a jolt through him, like ice flooding his veins.

Two sleepless nights. Even sleeping pills failed him.

Since their encounter at the concert, his mind had been restless. Work couldn’t hold his focus. He kept drifting, missing details in reports.

He didn’t understand why—only that Evadne was the cause.

So today, without telling Gordon, he’d driven here alone, waiting since afternoon.

He couldn’t deny it—he wanted to see her.

Even if just for one decent night’s sleep, he needed to see her.

But seeing her with Avery again? It felt like a hammer to his skull. Pain blurred his vision.

Would this cure his insomnia? No. It might just give him a heart attack.

Thaddeus’s grip tightened on the wheel. With a growl, he slammed the accelerator.

The Lamborghini shot forward, chasing the Bentley’s trail.

Silverlake Harbor buzzed with activity. Servants scurried to prepare for the evening’s guests.

Answering Emeric’s summons, the Ashbourne siblings had gathered—Ca**ius, Arnold, and Aaron were already there. Evadne was en route.

Nydia couldn’t make it, tied up with an important lecture. Since this wasn’t a major event, Myra let her focus on studies.

"More men than women tonight," Arnold mused, sipping coffee. He glanced at Ca**ius and Aaron, sighing. "Just you two single guys? Where are the girls?"

"Be grateful," Aaron drawled, sprawled on the couch in his leather jacket. "We just closed a big case. Chief gave us time off. Otherwise, no way I’d be here."

After years in the force, any trace of his rich-kid polish had vanished.

As the youngest Ashbourne, he resembled Emeric most—thick brows, sharp nose, full lips. Sun-kissed skin made his bright eyes even more striking.

"Dramatic," Arnold muttered.

"Could’ve been worse."

Crack!

Ca**ius and Arnold jumped.

Aaron, without moving, snatched a walnut midair.

"Thanks, Mom. You know I love these." He crushed it on the table, grinning as he popped the pieces into his mouth.

"Look at you!" Suri stormed over, hands on hips. "Is this how a cop acts? Where’s the Ashbourne dignity? Ten years undercover in the mafia?"

Aaron smirked. "Same difference." He held out his palm. "Got more?"

"Change your clothes! Now!" Suri kicked his boot. "Mr. Jeff’s arriving soon. Don’t embarrass your father!"

In the study, Emeric sat with **es perched on his nose, studying photos.

Evadne and Avery.

"As instructed, I’ve monitored Ms. Evadne’s romantic connections," Mr. Dn said. "She hasn’t contacted others on the list, but she’s often seen with the Chambers heir."

Emeric scrutinized the images. "Has he behaved inappropriately with my daughter?"

"No. Mr. Avery is... restrained."

Emeric hummed, thoughtful.

A knock. Myra’s voice floated through.

"Emeric, Mr. Jeff and young Mr. Chambers have arrived."
###Chapter 169

The grand foyer of the Ashbourne estate glittered under crystal chandeliers.

Ca**ius Ashbourne stood flanked by his brothers Arnold and Aaron, all three dressed in tailored tuxedos that accentuated their commanding presence. Their wives, elegant in designer gowns, completed the striking ensemble as they welcomed Jeff Chambers and his second son, Byron.

"Ca**ius! Arnold!" Jeff's booming voice carried across the marble floors as he approached with outstretched hands. "Or should I say President Ashbourne and Prosecutor Arnold now? My, how time flies!" His gaze shifted to the youngest Ashbourne brother. "And this must be Aaron? Last I saw him, he was that mischievous little boy trailing after Suri. Look at him now - dashing enough to steal hearts across the city. Where are you working these days, young man?"

Aaron straightened his posture. "I serve in the Criminal Police Department, sir."

"A cop?" Jeff's smile faltered for a fraction of a second before recovering.

To a business magnate like Jeff Chambers, police work represented menial civil service - dangerous grunt work with stagnant career prospects. Hardly comparable to inheriting a corporate empire.

Suri Ashbourne's manicured fingers fluttered to her pearls. "My son isn't as accomplished as his brothers, I'm afraid." The admission tasted bitter. Coming from high society herself, she'd always pressured her children toward prestigious careers. Aaron's stubborn pursuit of law enforcement remained her greatest disappointment.

"Nonsense!" Aviana Ashbourne cut in, slapping Aaron's back with pride. "This boy's got three first-class commendations and cracked the Delacroix smuggling case last month. Youngest captain in precinct history!"

Arnold nodded. "At twenty-seven, he's already heading major investigations."

Jeff's eyebrows rose. "Impressive credentials."

Aaron ducked his head, warmth spreading through his chest at his family's defense.

"Jeff Chambers!" Emeric Ashbourne's voice rang out as he descended the staircase with Myra and Mr. Dun in tow. "I was beginning to think you'd fled the country to avoid seeing me."

"You're one to talk!" Jeff shot back. "Two months ago when I invited you riding, you claimed prior engagements. Since when does Emeric Ashbourne turn down horses? Unless..." He eyed Emeric up and down. "Age finally catching up to those stiff joints?"

Emeric's laugh echoed through the hall. "Save your concern for when we're sharing a nursing home. I'll be the one pushing your wheelchair, old friend."

The familiar banter drew chuckles from the assembled guests.

Jeff cut a sharp figure in his charcoal Brioni suit, the silver tie catching the light. But all eyes lingered on Emeric's unconventional choice - a snow-white silk robe embroidered with intricate obsidian patterns that whispered of both luxury and rebellion. At sixty, he carried himself with the vigor of a man half his age, his dark hair barely touched by silver.

Byron Chambers stepped forward with practiced politeness. "Mr. Emeric, it's an honor."

Unlike his half-brother Avery's delicate beauty, Byron inherited Jeff's striking angularity - razor-sharp cheekbones beneath winged brows, a gaze that cut like honed steel.

"Byron!" Emeric clasped the younger man's shoulder warmly. "Jeff mentioned you'd bring your brother tonight. Where is the boy hiding?"

"Last-minute business," Jeff grumbled, scanning the room. "Speaking of missing guests - where's that daughter of yours, Emeric? You promised me Evadne would be here."

Emeric checked his Patek Philippe. "She'll arrive. When my girl gives her word..."

The butler's announcement cut through the murmurs: "Ms. Evadne has returned."

Emeric's face lit up like sunrise over the Alps.

Jeff perked up instantly, while Byron's fingers twitched toward his tie knot. The usually unflappable tycoon adjusted his cuffs with uncharacteristic nervousness.

"Dad!"

The voice came like wind chimes in spring - light, musical, impossible to ignore.

Evadne Ashbourne floated into the room on Avery Chambers' arm, a vision in emerald silk that set her amber eyes aflame. The collective intake of breath was audible.

Ca**ius alone showed no surprise.

Jeff's smile froze. Byron's jaw clenched. The Chambers men exchanged glances thick with unspoken accusations.

"Mr. Emeric, Father." Avery bowed gracefully before locking eyes with Evadne. "Forgive our tardiness."

Jeff's gaze darted between them. "You two arrived together?"

Avery's lips curved as he gazed at Evadne. "I insisted on fetching her myself." The possessive edge in his voice sent Byron's fingers tightening around his champagne flute.
###Chapter 170

The grand hall fell into an abrupt silence.

Evangeline turned, startled, locking eyes with Adrian's tender gaze.

That single utterance of her name—"Evangeline"—made Damien's expression darken further.

Ezekiel glanced between his daughter and Adrian, his expression unreadable. A faint smile played on his lips as he remarked, "So Adrian went out of his way to fetch Evangeline? How thoughtful of you."

"Mr. Ezekiel, no need for formalities."

Benedict elbowed Cassian beside him and whispered, "Cassian, when did Evangeline and Mr. Adrian get so close? How come I didn’t know?"

"Do you need to know everything about Evangeline?" Cassian replied coolly.

"You knew about this?"

"Obviously."

"Ugh! You’re just showing off now!"

"I asked Adrian to pick her up."

Benedict gasped. "Cassian, how could you just hand our sister over to another man? You can’t judge someone by their looks alone—what if he has ulterior motives? What if he tried something inappropriate on the way?"

"Ulterior motives are to be expected. No man, no matter how perfect, could resist Evangeline’s charm. As for the latter," Cassian’s lips curled slightly, "if Adrian were that kind of man, do you think he’d still be standing here unharmed?"

Exactly.

While other girls their age were still playing with dolls, Cassian and Elias had already been teaching Evangeline self-defense.

Truthfully, Cassian had his own reasons for this arrangement.

Dominic had occupied thirteen years of Evangeline’s life. Though she was fully awake now and had erased him from her heart, the scars he left behind ran deep.

Someone needed to fill that void.

Her brothers couldn’t, but perhaps Adrian could.

After the families exchanged pleasantries, the men remained in the living room discussing business, while the three women dragged Evangeline into the garden for interrogation.

"Evangeline, be honest—what’s going on between you and Mr. Adrian?" Seraphina asked bluntly, looping an arm around Evangeline’s waist.

"We’re just friends," Evangeline answered plainly.

"Boyfriend?" Seraphina pressed eagerly.

"Male friend!" Evangeline rolled her eyes.

"Ha! There’s no such thing as platonic friendship between a man and a woman. If he’s not your boyfriend now, he will be soon!"

Seraphina pinched her waist. "Remember when your father was ambushed by business rivals in the northern district? I saved him. He said he just wanted to be friends too—look at us now! The only thing missing is a child!"

Evangeline was speechless, utterly defeated by Seraphina’s shamelessness.

Lillian and Genevieve exchanged amused glances.

Without Seraphina’s intervention back then, Ezekiel might not have survived.

Even now, Seraphina bore the scars from the bullet wounds she took protecting him.

"Evangeline, it wouldn’t be bad if you ended up with Mr. Adrian," Lillian mused dreamily. "Your families are well-matched in status and wealth. Mr. Geoffrey and your father get along well. If you married into the Chambers family, they’d treat you right."

"Plus, Mr. Adrian is gorgeous. Your children would be stunning."

"Wait—how did we jump from friendship to children? What kind of logic is this?" Evangeline felt like the conversation was spiraling out of control.

"Lillian, we can’t just consider appearances when it comes to Evangeline’s future," Genevieve interjected rationally. "From what I know, Mr. Adrian just returned from abroad and holds minimal shares in the Chambers Group. His position isn’t stable. His mother was sent overseas under the guise of recuperation and has no influence. If Evangeline marries him, it might seem like an equal match, but in reality, she’d be lowering her status. He might even be eyeing her dowry to strengthen his own position."

"Oh! That makes so much sense! We can’t rush this!" Seraphina immediately switched sides.

"Evangeline, even when shopping, we compare three stores—let alone marriage. Either don’t marry, or marry someone perfect! Or… maybe reconsider Damien?"

Evangeline groaned, covering her face.

Too many mothers were a headache. Once these women started, there was no stopping them.

Ah! Her temples throbbed.

Dinner passed smoothly, with everyone enjoying Ezekiel’s aged wine and exquisite dishes in perfect harmony.

In truth, this meal was just two old friends catching up—no different from twenty years ago.

The only difference? Now they had children.

And this time, Geoffrey had an agenda—finding wives for his two unmarried sons.

Damien sat across from Evangeline, while Adrian was seated right beside her.

The table was absurdly long. Those opposite her were at a clear disadvantage.

Damien watched, seething, as Adrian doted on Evangeline, his fork bending under his grip.

This entire operation was a disaster!

His damn brother had stolen every advantage!

He knew Evangeline adored seafood—crabs and prawns were her weakness. She could eat them endlessly if given the chance.

Adrian barely touched his food, meticulously peeling shrimp for her, constantly refilling her plate.

Everyone noticed.

Evangeline, completely at ease with her family, indulged without restraint.

Adrian’s gaze remained lowered, a faint smile on his lips as he deftly peeled each shrimp before placing it on her plate.

For someone of his status, this behavior was unusual.

Yet he seemed entirely absorbed, as if no one else existed.

Evangeline didn’t refuse, accepting his attentions without hesitation.

Had they been alone, she would’ve declined.

But with Geoffrey present?

A golden opportunity to expose Damien’s hypocrisy. She wouldn’t waste it.

Damien scoffed inwardly as Adrian wiped his fingers meticulously after each shrimp.

His brother was a notorious germaphobe—he wouldn’t even rewear clothes. Yet for Evangeline, he’d tossed his principles aside.

All to compete with him. Desperate.

"Our daughter can be quite willful. My apologies, Geoffrey," Ezekiel said awkwardly.

"Ezekiel, don’t be ridiculous! We’re practically family—no need for apologies! Evangeline’s sincerity reminds me so much of you in your youth. It’s endearing. I’d love to welcome her into the Chambers family as our daughter-in-law!"

Geoffrey, silent all evening, finally revealed his true intentions.

Ezekiel chuckled noncommittally.

By now, Evangeline was full, covering her mouth as she stifled a burp.

Adrian turned, his warm gaze lingering on her.

"Wipe your hands." He handed her a napkin discreetly.

"Thanks." She accepted it with a smile, dabbing her lips elegantly.

"Ms. Evangeline, you’ve quite the appetite tonight," Damien remarked with a polite smile.

"My apologies. The food was too delicious to resist."

"No, no—I didn’t mean it negatively. I admire your authenticity. You’re nothing like the socialites I know. I find it… charming."

Did eating heartily make her authentic? Did the women he knew not eat?

Evangeline bit back a sarcastic retort, replying instead, "Thank you, Damien."

"You haven’t had much to drink. Let me pour you some wine."

He stood, reaching for the decanter.

Adrian chuckled softly. "Seafood pairs with strong liquor or white wine—never red. Didn’t you know? How… impractical of you."

Damien’s grip tightened.

Adrian’s smirk deepened.

The battle lines were drawn.
###Chapter 171

Avery's mocking words made Byron's expression darken instantly, his fingers curling into tight fists.

The Ashbourne family members remained silent, but Jeff suddenly had an epiphany, his furious gaze locking onto Avery.

"Evadne, ladies should have warm beverages. I've arranged for some mulled wine to be prepared for you. A small glass won't hurt," Avery said with a gentle smile, deliberately ignoring Byron's visible irritation.

"Uh, I'm fine with anything, really."

Trapped between the two Chambers brothers, Evadne shifted uncomfortably, forcing an awkward laugh. "But if I had to choose, I'd prefer a beer."

Both brothers turned to her simultaneously, their voices overlapping sharply. "Absolutely not! You'll get gout!"

As the banquet neared its end, Avery excused himself to visit the restroom.

At the sink, he pumped an excessive amount of soap into his palms, scrubbing furiously as if his hands were contaminated specimens. His skin turned raw from the friction, but he still couldn't shake the lingering scent of seafood.

He washed five times, sniffing his hands each time before squeezing more soap, meticulously cleaning every crevice.

The restroom door creaked open.

Byron strode in, his expression stormy. Seeing Avery's obsessive handwashing, he smirked. "Having a rough night? Peeling shrimp for Evadne must be torture for a germaphobe like you. Bet you'll be dreaming about hand sanitizer tonight."

Avery ignored the jab, calmly drying his hands with a paper towel.

"Long time no see, Avery. I thought Helgen might’ve taught you something impressive." Byron sneered. "Turns out all you learned was how to grovel."

"Jealous, Byron?"

Avery adjusted his glasses, his tone light but cutting. "At least I got close to her. You? You’re still scrambling for scraps outside, desperate for her attention."

"You—!"

"Face it. While you’re out here flailing, I’m the one she’s actually smiling at."

Byron’s eyes burned with rage. "Hah! No wonder Dad always favored me. You’d rather debase yourself than stand with dignity."

"In this world, the ends justify the means."

Avery tossed the towel into the bin, his smile chilling. "You never waste words on me. Why the sudden chatter tonight? Could it be… you’re panicking? Watching me get closer to Evadne while you flounder?"

"Avery! Don’t get ahead of yourself! Dad would never approve of you with an Ashbourne! You think you can compete with me?!" Byron snarled, his teeth grinding.

"Worthiness isn’t for you to decide."

Avery turned slowly, his gaze narrowing behind his gold-rimmed glasses. "As for Evadne? She will be mine."

Predictably, Byron stormed out, slamming the door behind him.

Avery’s smile vanished, his fists clenching.

His phone buzzed. He answered coldly. "Speak."

"Mr. Chambers, brace yourself." His secretary’s voice was tense. "Thaddeus is here. Alone. Right outside the Ashbourne estate."

Avery’s eyes sharpened. "Understood."

Thaddeus stood under a flickering streetlamp across from Silvercrest Harbor, clad in a thin suit.

Despite Skyrim’s coastal warmth, the autumn night wind bit through his sleeves, sending chills down his spine.

This was his third time waiting here for Evadne.

But tonight, something was different. A quiet desperation had ignited in his chest, burning fiercer with each passing minute.

He stared at the stars, wondering—what if she never came?

As her ex-husband, pride kept him from reaching out. Humiliation was a bitter pill he refused to swallow.

So he waited. And waited.

He had to see her.

Then—the gates creaked open.

Thaddeus’s pulse spiked, his body tensing as he leaned forward.

His breath hitched.

But it wasn’t Evadne.

Avery strolled out, smirking.

"Mr. Thaddeus, lurking outside private property at this hour? How… ungentlemanly."

Thaddeus didn’t flinch. "Since when do you own Skyrim?"

"Still sore about losing, aren’t you?" Avery laughed coldly. "I know why you’re here. Regret’s eating you alive. You realized too late that Acacia played you, and now you want Evadne back. As if she’s some consolation prize."

Thaddeus’s throat tightened, the taste of bitterness spreading.

"Evadne’s moved on. With me. If you think you can waltz back into her life, you’ll have to go through me first." Avery adjusted his glasses, his gaze glacial.

"You don’t speak for her."

Thaddeus lifted his chin, defiance blazing. "If I want a second chance, she’s the one who’ll reject me. Not you."

"Avery!"

"Thaddeus!"

Two voices cut through the night.

Thaddeus’s head snapped up—

Evadne was storming toward him, her eyes blazing. His heart lurched.

"Evadne, you’ll catch a chill," Avery murmured, his harshness melting into concern.

But she breezed past him without a glance, stopping directly in front of Thaddeus.

Their gazes locked, an invisible force field sealing them in their own world.

Avery’s fists clenched.

"Mr. Thaddeus, back again? Should I start charging admission for the view?" Evadne crossed her arms, her tone razor-sharp.

Thaddeus swallowed. "The view is beautiful."

Her eye twitched. Was he mocking her?

"Next time, I’ll arrange a guided tour. Stop treating my home like a tourist trap." She gritted her teeth. "Now leave."

Thaddeus studied her for a long moment before murmuring, "Goodnight."

Evadne blinked.

Goodnight?

He came all this way just to say that?

Without another word, Thaddeus turned and walked toward his car.

"Thaddeus, wait."
###Chapter 172

Thaddeus had his back turned to her, a faint smirk playing on his lips.

But for some reason, he couldn’t bring himself to face her.

Avery’s jaw was clenched tight, his eyes dark with unreadable emotions.

Even though Evadne and Thaddeus were divorced now—and far from amicable—there was still something unresolved between them.

"Thaddeus, if you came here to talk, then talk."

Evadne stepped forward, her gaze boring into his back. "Don’t act like you’ve got a guilty conscience. I don’t need the nightmares."

Thaddeus swallowed hard before finally turning to face her. "It’s nothing. I just couldn’t sleep."

Evadne frowned. What did his insomnia have to do with her?

Was he seriously blaming her for his sleepless nights?

Ridiculous. Since when was everything her fault? She hadn’t done a damn thing wrong.

"If you can’t sleep, take a pill or count sheep. Showing up here won’t fix anything."

"It already has." Thaddeus met her eyes, his voice low. "Tonight, I think I’ll sleep just fine."

With that, he turned and walked away.

Evadne watched until his car vanished into the night, then muttered under her breath, "Psycho."

Back in his car, exhaustion hit Thaddeus like a tidal wave. His eyes burned, red-rimmed and heavy.

He gripped the steering wheel, his muscles tense, his breathing uneven.

As he watched Evadne and Avery disappear inside, his chest tightened.

With trembling fingers, he grabbed his phone and dialed Gordon.

"Mr. Thaddeus, what can I do for you?"

"Dig into it."

"Into… what?" Gordon sounded confused.

"The connection between the Ashbourne Group and the Chambers Group. And Evadne’s relationship with Avery."

Thaddeus’s voice was ice-cold. "Evadne isn’t the kind of woman who gets played. I don’t buy Avery’s story."

"Understood! I’ll get right on it!"

Gordon sounded almost pleased, his tone brightening before he cautiously added, "If only you’d trusted Evadne sooner, she might not have left. None of this mess would’ve happened."

"One more word, and you’re on the next flight to the Africa branch." Thaddeus gritted his teeth.

Gordon immediately backtracked. "Sorry! I spoke out of turn!"

Evadne had noticed Thaddeus at the gate.

She hadn’t wanted to deal with him—he could clean up his own messes.

But Avery had gone out to confront him, so she’d stepped in before things escalated.

The brief interruption didn’t ruin the evening. Dinner ended on a high note, laughter filling the air.

Emeric retreated to his study with Mr. Dan, then discreetly summoned Cas sius and Arnold.

"Dad, what’s this about?" Cas sius asked.

"How much do you know about Evadne and Mr. Avery? Be honest." Emeric sat elegantly on the sofa, his expression unreadable.

The brothers exchanged glances before Arnold nudged Cas sius forward. "You should ask him. I had no idea Evadne and Mr. Avery were even close."

Cas sius remained silent, his expression guarded.

"Cas sius, how serious is this?" Emeric pressed. "Since when does Evadne let a man dote on her like that? Tonight, Avery was practically feeding her, and she didn’t refuse. What’s really going on between them? Has she actually fallen for him?"

"Dad, you sound like you don’t approve of Mr. Avery," Cas sius pointed out bluntly.

Emeric didn’t respond.

"Avery and Evadne have known each other since they were kids. They’ve always gotten along. There aren’t many men Evadne tolerates, and the Chambers family has been our ally for years. If Avery and Evadne end up together, it wouldn’t be a bad thing."

Cas sius spoke calmly, but Emeric’s frown deepened.

"Tonight, Mr. Jeff made his intentions clear. He wants to arrange a marriage between our families. Why else bring his two unmarried sons? He’s got his eye on Evadne."

Emeric nodded. "And I won’t allow it."

The Ashbourne siblings blinked in surprise.

They hadn’t expected their father to be so vehemently against the Chambers family.

"Dad, do you have some kind of beef with Mr. Jeff? Did you two have a falling out?"

Arnold gave his father a thumbs-up. "Impressive, keeping your cool while secretly hating someone. If it were me, I’d have lost it by now."

"Arnold, how the hell did you pass the bar? Did they just let you slide because of my name?"

Emeric shot him an irritated look before turning serious. "Evadne is my little princess. She just got out of that disaster with the Abernathy family. I’m not throwing her into the viper’s nest that is the Chambers family. Do you think they’re some picture-perfect dynasty? It’s a den of snakes, every one of them scheming. If Evadne marries into that, she’ll be torn apart. And let’s not forget—Avery is Jeff’s least favorite son. He clawed his way up overseas, and you can bet there’s blood on his hands. He’s probably thinking marrying into our family will clean up his image and give him a foothold back home. And I won’t have it."

Arnold was stunned. Cas sius lowered his head, guilt gnawing at him.

He’d only wanted his sister to move on. He hadn’t considered the deeper implications.

"My daughters lift others up, but not at the cost of their own happiness. That’s non-negotiable."

The sleek Bentley sped toward Elmsworth.

Byron drove his own luxury car, while Jeff—surprisingly—invited Avery to ride with him.

Father and son sat in tense silence. There was history between them, but little warmth.

"Avery, what’s going on between you and Miss Ashbourne?" Jeff’s voice was flat.

"Since when do you care about my love life?"

Avery smirked. "I lived abroad with Mom for fifteen years, and you never asked. Now that I’m back in Elmsworth, suddenly you’re interested?"

"Don’t deflect. I’m asking about Evadne!" Jeff’s tone sharpened, his eyes flashing with anger.

"Like you saw tonight, Evadne and I are close." Avery adjusted his glasses, his smile cold.

Jeff took a deep breath, a vein pulsing at his temple. "From now on, stay away from her. Keep your distance."

"Why?" Avery’s smirk didn’t waver.

"Because Evadne is meant for Byron. You getting involved ruins everything."

"Byron’s your son. So am I. If Evadne marries me, she’s still your daughter-in-law. What’s the problem?"

"My decision is final. Byron marries Evadne. If you want an Ashbourne, there’s Nydia—Myra’s daughter. She’s still single."

"So the unwanted son only gets the spare daughter, is that it?" Avery’s smile turned icy.

"Avery! Enough!"

Jeff’s eyes burned with fury. "You don’t compete with Byron. Know your place!"

"I’ve heard that my whole life. And yet, nothing has ever truly been mine."

Avery closed his eyes, his smile chilling. "I’m done waiting for scraps. Tell Byron not to bother. Evadne is mine, and no one’s taking her from me."
###Chapter 173

The Regal Palace and The Grand Marquis had been playing nice in public, but behind closed doors, their rivalry was fiercer than ever. Isabella Sinclair, an A-list Hollywood celebrity, commanded attention wherever she went. Her wedding would only happen if it was sponsored by luxury brands. Everyone knew Isabella was obsessed with jewelry. She'd even hosted private exhibitions to showcase her priceless collection.

For her upcoming wedding, she'd set impossible demands for both The Regal Palace and The Grand Marquis. The jewelry she wore had to be one-of-a-kind, crafted by the finest designers. Only one piece would do.

"Isabella insists on jewels that match her status—nothing less than extraordinary."

Nathan Prescott relayed his agent's words to Alexander Kingsley and the executives in the boardroom. "She won't dictate the style or designer. She's leaving it up to The Regal Palace and The Grand Marquis."

"Whichever hotel presents jewelry that meets her standards gets to host the wedding. No negotiations."

Alexander listened, fingers drumming against the polished mahogany table, deep in thought.

The executives erupted in murmurs.

"Is she looking for sponsors or a personal jeweler?"

"Who does she think she is? Just another actress with an inflated ego."

"Isabella's demands are ridiculous. She should be writing exams, not planning weddings."

Alexander's sharp gaze cut through the chatter. "This is a boardroom, not a gossip circle. Speak up if you have solutions. Otherwise, stay silent."

The room fell quiet.

The Head of Design quickly listed renowned jewelry designers, presenting detailed portfolios of their work.

Alexander scanned the names. "Why isn't Henri Delacroix on this list?"

The mention of Henri silenced the room.

Alexander frowned. "What's with the reaction?"

"Mr. Kingsley," the Head of Design hesitated, "Henri is... different. He's a legend. Every designer I just mentioned reveres him. Some openly admit they study his work for inspiration."

"Henri is untouchable. His pieces are museum-worthy. Convincing him to design for a celebrity like Isabella? Impossible."

Alexander leaned forward. "No one is untouchable. Everyone has a price."

His voice left no room for argument. "Henri Delacroix will design Isabella's wedding jewelry."

The executives exchanged stunned glances.

The Head of Design wiped her brow. "Sir, the designers I suggested are award-winning. They can deliver."

Alexander shook his head. "Your choices are excellent. But you're missing the bigger picture—our competition."

He smirked. "The Grand Marquis is run by Evelyn Prescott. She doesn't settle for second best. If we present anything less than Henri's work, she'll crush us."

His eyes gleamed with rare admiration. "Evelyn won't cut corners. She'll go straight for the best. So we have to secure Henri before she does."

Doubt lingered in the room.

Could Evelyn really pull that off?

"Find me everything on Henri. Not his work—his personal details. Within 24 hours."

As Alexander stood to leave, the Head of Design spoke up. "Sir, about Henri... there's only one thing I can tell you for certain."

Alexander turned. "What?"

"He's a man."

The next day.

Evelyn wrapped up her meeting and returned to her office.

"Daniel, I'm starving. Order me fried chicken and beer. Fast." She didn't look up from her game.

Daniel sighed. "You're worry-free while I'm losing my mind. Isabella's team wants a top designer, and The Regal Palace is already moving. How are you so calm? You rejected every designer the team suggested—insisted on Henri. Do you even realize how impossible that is?"

Evelyn smirked. "If we can't get Henri, neither can they. No rush."

A video call flashed on her screen.

Daniel moved to leave, but Evelyn stopped him. "Stay. This is interesting."

She answered.

A striking blonde woman appeared.

"Long time no see, Gabrielle."

"Alexander Kingsley just contacted me," Gabrielle said. "He wants Henri to design for Isabella."

Evelyn laughed. "Alexander, reaching out personally? How humble of him."

"Doesn't matter who asks. My answer is the same."

"What if I asked?" Evelyn rested her chin on her hand, eyes sparkling. "As Henri's assistant, could you make an exception, Gabrielle?"

Daniel blinked.

So this was why she'd been so confident. She knew Henri's assistant!

But Gabrielle's next words stunned him.

She leaned closer to the screen, smiling. "Don't tease me, Miss Delacroix."

Miss Delacroix?

Daniel's jaw dropped.

Evelyn... was Henri Delacroix?!
###Chapter 174

Jason's jaw nearly hit the floor.

His lady boss remained utterly unfazed, even stifling a yawn.

"Why reveal my identity now? Look what you've done—you've terrified Jason."

"Alea, you vanished after returning to Elmsworth! The entire studio's been waiting for your comeback!" Liva's eyes shimmered with unshed tears.

"Apologies, darling. Family matters kept me tied up. You'll have to hold down the fort at Aetheria Studio for now."

Evadne sighed, guilt flickering across her face. "But don't worry about the studio collapsing. Every piece I've designed is worth a fortune, and our funds are more than secure. Still, tell the team not to put their lives on hold for me. If anyone wants to leave, they have my blessing—no hard feelings. That includes you, Liva. If you want out, just say the word. No need to suffer for my sake."

Liva wiped her eyes. "Alea, you've done so much for me. I'd never abandon you."

"Liva, I'm endlessly grateful for your loyalty. But I refuse to be a burden. If you choose to stay, it's an honor—but your life is yours to live."

Evadne's eyes softened with warmth, a quiet chuckle escaping her. "I'd be lost without all of you."

Jason, overhearing, felt his throat tighten.

He'd been such a fool.

He thought he knew her—thought she was extraordinary. But she wasn't just extraordinary. She was divine.

Damn, he was so out of his league.

"Alea, if the Abernathy Group comes knocking again, I'll shut them down hard. Tell them you're partnering with K Group—that'll crush their spirits."

Evadne smirked. "Don't reject them outright. How can we shatter their hopes if we don't let them hope first?"

Liva's eyes widened, then she nodded in understanding. "Got it."

"Wouldn't it be boring if we won before the game even started? Before Thaddeus even makes his move?"

Evadne's sly grin returned. "I've been planning this for ages. Shouldn't Mr. Thaddeus get a chance to prove himself? Imagine his face when he exhausts himself to win, only to find his opponent already at the finish line. That's far more devastating than a simple loss."

After the call ended, Jason was still reeling.

Even knowing his boss was brilliant, discovering she was Alea left him speechless. He clasped his hands in reverence.

This was the closest he'd ever been to a goddess.

"Hey, snap out of it!" Evadne snapped her fingers, snapping him back to reality.

"Jason, do you think I'm being unfair?" She spun lazily in her chair.

"After how brutally Thaddeus treated you? He's getting off easy." Jason's jaw clenched.

"Ah, with your approval, I can relax."

Evadne leaned back, eyes closing as she turned toward the sunlight.

"The worst part of those three years wasn't his indifference, his coldness, or his neglect. It was watching him pour his heart into Acacia while we were married."

"I watched him book flights abroad. Watched him commission a master jeweler in France for her birthday—despite hating inconvenience. You'd think he'd show basic respect, even without love."

Her voice was detached, like she was narrating someone else's tragedy.

Jason's throat burned. He knelt beside her. "Thaddeus deserves hell for choosing trash over you."

Evadne laughed, waving a hand. "The old me would've raged. Now? I'm amused. If Acacia's trash, Thaddeus is the dumpster. She degraded from recyclable to waste—but he was always garbage. I won't waste feelings on a dumpster. But I will enjoy watching him scramble for me. Watching him fail after giving his all."

Thaddeus had always been heartless.

Funny—so was she now.

Thaddeus flew to Aetheria on a private jet, desperate to meet Alea.

Mid-flight, memories surfaced—of flying to France for Acacia's necklace, begging a royal jeweler. He'd never groveled before.

Now, that necklace was locked away, a symbol of shame.

Staring at the clouds, he swore he saw Evadne's face—radiant, mocking. His chest ached. He reached out, but the window was ice-cold.

"You know how much Evadne adored that necklace? She cried when she heard you gave it to Acacia."

"If it were Evadne, she'd have treasured even your discarded tie. She'd never disrespect you like that."

Agony lanced through him. The woman he thought would cherish his love had trampled it.

And yet—this wreckage was exactly what Evadne wanted.

His lips twisted into a bitter smile.

What kind of madness made her stay with him for three years?

Why had she been so devoted?

Gordon approached with coffee. "Sir, Liva agreed to meet."

Thaddeus's dead eyes flickered to life.

"But she's cold. This won't be easy."

"As long as she meets me, there's hope."

After three days of waiting, Thaddeus faced Liva in a café opposite Alea Studio.

She didn't even sit. "Let's be clear, Mr. Frederic. Alea designs for First Ladies, royalty, and philanthropists. Ada Ang? Unworthy."

Gordon muttered, "It's jewelry, not a Nobel Prize."

Thaddeus remained calm. "I established a charity fund in my mother's name. I support nursing homes, students, orphans. Name your price—all profits from Ada's wedding will go to charity."

Liva scoffed. "So Alea lacks vision?"

"That's not—"

"Many exploit charity for Alea's designs. Is the Abernathy Fund just moving money between pockets?"

Thaddeus's fists clenched.

Gordon snapped, "We're sincere! You're being unreasonable!"

Thaddeus silenced him. "Our funds are transparent. You can audit them."

Liva stood. "I'll relay your intentions to Alea. But others want her too."

She left without touching her coffee.

Gordon groaned. "Is menopause hitting early here?"

"Enough. We need a backup plan." Thaddeus adjusted his tie. "Alea's playing hardball. Evadne won't get better terms."

"What next?"

"Focus on Ada, but don't lose sight of Alea." Thaddeus's eyes darkened. "Watch Evadne. If she makes a move, I want to know immediately."
###Chapter 175

Ever since Lucas returned from Aetheria to Elmsworth, he'd been monitoring Isabella's every move.

But reports indicated nothing unusual about Isabella.

She'd been occupied with managing her luxury hotel, never stepping foot outside Elmsworth.

Nathaniel sat in his office, gazing out the window, his brow furrowed.

With Evelyn's wedding date approaching, shouldn't Isabella be frantic? Had she truly given up on Alea, or was she plotting something else entirely?

The burglary at Rose Manor, Eleanor's arrest, and the hijacking of the Westguard project—all these incidents had left Nathaniel wary of Isabella.

Honestly, what kind of man starts fearing his ex-wife after the divorce?

Then, the phone rang.

"Mr. Nathaniel, Mr. Daniel is here to see you," his secretary announced respectfully.

"Let him in."

The moment Daniel strode into the CEO's office, he made himself at home, sprawling across the sofa like he owned the place. The only thing missing was him kicking off his shoes.

"How many times must I tell you not to drop by unannounced? Do you think I have as much free time as you?" Nathaniel didn't even glance up, continuing to sign documents.

"Can't I visit my best friend without an agenda? Who do you think you are?" Daniel smirked. "Though, my mom was watching a drama recently, and the male lead reminded me of you. Both heartless villains."

"Spit it out or get out." Nathaniel set down his pen and straightened.

"Serena's been back for days. Mom wants you over for dinner."

"I'm swamped. Evelyn's situation isn't resolved. I'm not in the mood for socializing."

"It's been ages since you last saw your godmother! She just returned from abroad and went through the trouble of preparing your favorite dishes. Show some respect!" Daniel rolled his eyes. "She'll be devastated if you don't come."

Nathaniel pressed his lips together, then relented. "Fine. I'll go."

"That's more like it! Serena will be thrilled." Daniel grinned. "You might be an outcast in your own family, but in ours, you're practically royalty."

Nathaniel suddenly recalled the concert hall incident—Serena's overly affectionate behavior—and discomfort prickled under his skin.

Years ago, he'd held young Serena's hand while strolling through the park. Back then, she was just a ten-year-old girl, and he treated her like a little sister.

But now, she was grown. She could be naive, but he couldn't afford to be.

Just as he was about to speak, a knock interrupted.

"Come in."

"Mr. Nathaniel!" Gordon burst in, files in hand. "I've completed the investigation into Ms. Isabella's relationship with Adrian, as well as the ties between Chambers Group and Ashbourne Group!"

Daniel's eyebrows shot up.

Nathaniel nearly snapped his pen in half, his head spinning.

"Oh—Mr. Nathaniel, you have company. I'll leave you to it." Gordon offered an awkward smile and retreated.

"We're not strangers here."

Daniel plucked an orange from the fruit bowl, peeling it lazily while eyeing Nathaniel. "So? Couldn't take it anymore and decided to make your move?"

"Mind your own business." Nathaniel lowered his head, his pulse quickening.

"Why can't I ask? I pursued Ms. Isabella first. You and that powerless guy should both back off!" Daniel shoved an orange slice into his mouth, chewing aggressively.

"So what if you were first?"

Nathaniel's gaze darkened possessively. "She married me. She'll never be yours."

"Hah! What's a divorced man like you bragging for?"

Daniel nearly hurled the orange at him. "If you could divorce her, why can't you win her back? What's the point of having Gordon dig into trivial matters? By the time you stop procrastinating, she and Adrian might already have a kid!"

Nathaniel's heart lurched, but his voice remained icy. "Who said I want her back? I'm investigating their ties because she stole another one of my projects and is collaborating with Adrian. This could affect Abernathy Group's future plans."

"Sure, keep telling yourself that." Daniel scoffed, tossing an orange peel at him.

Nathaniel caught it, crushing it in his fist, his face stormy.

Gordon struggled to keep a straight face before clearing his throat. "Mr. Nathaniel, it appears Ms. Isabella and Adrian share no special relationship. For the past three years, Ms. Isabella has been devoted to you. Before that, there's no record of her interacting with Chambers Group."

Nathaniel's expression eased slightly.

At least Isabella hadn't teamed up with Adrian yet. The man was likely just wishful thinking.

"However, I recently discovered Mr. Jeffrey hauled his two single sons to Skyrim—probably to visit Chairman Reginald. Given the close ties between Ashbourne and Chambers families, I suspect Mr. Jeffrey is angling for a marriage alliance!"

Marriage alliance?

Both Nathaniel and Daniel stiffened.

They were the same age, their families were compatible, and they'd known each other for years. It was a match made in heaven—flawless.

A wave of panic crashed over Nathaniel, unstoppable and suffocating.

"We're screwed."

Daniel shot Nathaniel a meaningful look, his eyes tinged red. He chuckled darkly. "Even if Adrian's relentless in pursuing my goddess, I doubt Ms. Isabella can resist his full-court press. With Mr. Jeffrey personally proposing and father-son teamwork, plus Chairman Reginald's pressure—she might just say yes."

Nathaniel's face darkened like an approaching storm.

"Maybe you'll be attending your ex-wife's wedding soon. Better start saving for a lavish gift!" Daniel taunted, popping another orange slice into his mouth.

Rage surged in Nathaniel's throat, his voice rough. "Impossible. Isabella would never submit to an arranged marriage. She'd never fall for Adrian. A woman who's lived with a lion doesn't settle for a wolf."

"Ooh, someone's bitter."

"Daniel!" Nathaniel's glare could melt steel.

"I meant the orange is sour! What's your problem?"

That evening, Nathaniel accompanied Daniel to the Fairhaven estate as promised.

Though he considered the Fairhavens family and Mrs. Fairhaven his godmother, he still brought lavish gifts—top-tier health supplements for the elders.

Mrs. Fairhaven doted on Nathaniel, preparing a feast of his favorite dishes, with a few of Serena's preferences mixed in.

"Mom, you're playing favorites!"

Daniel pouted. "You forgot the dishes I asked for before leaving. They say sons forget their mothers after marriage, but you've forgotten your own son for Nathaniel. Heartbreaking!"

"You've eaten my cooking for over twenty years. Nathaniel rarely visits—of course I'll spoil him when he does. No comparisons."

Mrs. Fairhaven beamed at Nathaniel, her eyes brimming with affection. "Nathaniel, eat up. These are all your favorites."

"Thank you." Nathaniel offered a small smile and began eating.

"Have more, Nathaniel!"

Serena deliberately sat beside him, using her own utensils to serve him. "I made these myself. Try them!"

But before she could reach his plate, Nathaniel blocked her, disappointment flashing across her face.

"Thanks. I can serve myself."
###Chapter 176

Isabella's fair skin flushed crimson with embarrassment.

"Alexander, don't you like Isabella serving you with her own utensils? They're brand new—she saved the first bite for you." Daniel frowned, stepping in to defend his sister.

"Sorry, Alex. I didn't think it through."

Isabella quickly swapped for a fresh set of cutlery and picked up another slice of beef brisket, but he stopped her again.

"I can handle it myself."

She pouted. "Hmph, I haven't been home in years. Are you avoiding me now, Alex? We used to share ice cream as kids!"

"That was then. You're grown now." Alexander lowered his gaze, slicing into his steak with deliberate calm.

Isabella's heart twisted. Her smile faltered as she shoved the brisket into her mouth.

The lavish spread reminded Alexander of the meals Evelyn used to prepare for him.

He knew each dish took hours—her face glistening from the heat, stifling coughs as she worked.

Yet he'd never once praised her.

Her cooking rivaled five-star chefs. Even when he refused to admit it, he always craved seconds.

He remembered how her eyes would dim when he stayed silent, how she'd force a smile and promise, "I'll do better next time."

Would there even be a next time?

The thought turned the food to ash in his mouth.

"Alex," Isabella chirped, propping her chin on her hand, "Genevieve told me you're handling Ada's wedding and competing with The Regal Palace for the venue. Is that true?"

Her lashes fluttered. "Ada's arriving in Elmsworth soon. Are you throwing her a welcome party? It's perfect publicity—she's a global icon!"

Alexander's gaze frosted over, though his expression remained neutral.

He despised mixing business with family dinners. And he loathed outsiders prying into his company.

"Hmm."

"Can I help?" Her eyes sparkled.

"No."

"I could play piano for Ada and the guests! It's my specialty!"

She was desperate to impress him.

"No." His tone was final. "You're a Sinclair. It's inappropriate. We'll hire professionals."

Her cheeks burned. "Are you saying I'm not good enough?"

Alexander's appetite vanished. He'd only come tonight out of respect for Mrs. Sinclair and Daniel. Now, irritation prickled under his skin.

"Alexander, Isabella's a virtuoso. Let her perform at your party," Daniel said between bites.

"Yes, dear, she sees you as family. Let her help," Mrs. Sinclair coaxed.

"Alex, I won't embarrass you," Isabella pleaded, eyes wide.

With a terse nod, he relented.

After dinner, Alexander made his exit.

The moment he stepped outside, his assistant rushed over with urgent news.

"Mr. Kingsley, there's an issue. K Hotel is hosting Ada's welcome party—on the same night as ours."

Alexander's jaw tightened. "Evelyn's behind this?"

"Sharp as ever, sir." The assistant hesitated. "Given Mrs. Abernathy's... formidable negotiating skills, she might sway Ada. Should we... concede this one?"

"No." Alexander's voice was steel. "With the Alea deal fallen through, Ada's our only option. If Evelyn's making this move, she's just as desperate. Every advantage counts now. We will secure Ada's attendance."

He slid into his car, expression grim.

The assistant sighed.

God, why is he so stubborn?

How will he ever win Evelyn back like this?

Leaning back, Alexander exhaled sharply.

Should he let Evelyn have this victory, as suggested?

But since their divorce, he'd never once bested her.

She was always ahead—outmaneuvering him at every turn.

The realization struck him: Evelyn wasn't the gentle woman he'd married. She was brilliant, regal, unmatched. And with each passing day, she felt further out of reach.

Maybe if he could just win once, the gap between them wouldn't feel so vast.

——

Late that night, Daniel was out clubbing at Sapphire Nights.

Alone with her mother, Isabella curled up in bed beside her.

Mrs. Sinclair sighed. "Darling, why were you so... familiar with Alexander tonight? You made him uncomfortable."

Her tone held gentle reproach. "You're not a child anymore, and he's not the boy who played with you. He's CEO of Abernathy Group now—every move he makes is scrutinized. That kind of closeness... it's inappropriate."

Isabella sat up abruptly. "Mother, I wasn't being clingy. And I've never seen Alex as a brother."

"What?" Mrs. Sinclair blinked.

"Do you know why I turned down the Royal Symphony Orchestra in Aetheria? Why I came back to Elmsworth?" Her eyes gleamed. "For him. I want to be his wife."

"Have you lost your mind? He's practically family!"

"We're not blood-related!" Isabella's voice was fervent. "I've waited years. Now that he's free from Acacia, nothing's stopping me."

Mrs. Sinclair's face paled.

"Mother, what's wrong? Don't you want this for me?" Isabella shook her arm.

"It's not that, but—" She hesitated. "Alexander's an exceptional man, but a terrible husband. Between Acacia and his first marriage... The Abernathys are ruthless, darling. I fear you'd be eaten alive."

Isabella nearly laughed.

Innocent? That fool Genevieve was the innocent one!

If she married into that family, she'd have those Abernathy women begging for her favor. Her mother underestimated her entirely.

"Mother! We're Sinclairs—we're every bit their equals. And if anyone dares mistreat me, Daniel will make them pay!"

"But marriage requires mutual feelings. Even if you're determined, does Alexander feel the same?"

Isabella smiled. "Once I prove my worth—that I'm not just a child, but someone who can stand beside him—he'll see me."

"Still—"

"No more 'buts,' Mother. It's Alexander or no one."
###Chapter 177

Three days.

That was all the time left before Isabella Sinclair and her entourage descended upon New York.

But today, Jason received unsettling news from his agent—Isabella had made a last-minute decision to attend the exclusive gala hosted by the Vanderbilt Group!

In the private lounge of The Regal Palace Hotel.

When Jason burst in to deliver the news to Evelyn, she was casually playing pool with Alexander.

They were locked in a fierce match, taking turns sinking balls with the precision of professionals.

"Ms. Evelyn! We're in trouble!" Jason blurted out, breathless.

"Shh, it's game point!"

Evelyn pressed a slender finger to her lips, silencing him instantly.

This game determined who would pay for dinner tonight. There was no room for distractions.

Jason swallowed his panic, knowing better than to interrupt.

Crossing Evelyn during her downtime was a death wish.

With two balls left, Evelyn lined up her shot—perfect angle, perfect force.

The final ball dropped into the pocket with a satisfying clack.

"Victory!" She flashed a triumphant grin, twirling her cue stick.

Alexander leaned against the table, watching her with amusement. "Your skills have improved."

Evelyn smirked. "Only because I had the best teacher."

Today, she wore a crimson satin gown that clung to her curves. As she moved, one delicate strap slipped off her shoulder, revealing flawless skin that glowed under the dim lights.

Jason's breath hitched.

Alexander noticed. His gaze turned icy.

He stepped forward, adjusting the strap with deliberate care. "Be more careful," he murmured. "I don't like other men staring."

His sharp eyes locked onto Jason, who immediately looked away, sweat beading at his temples.

Under that piercing stare, he felt exposed.

"Relax, Alexander. Jason's harmless." Evelyn waved a dismissive hand before picking up her wineglass.

Alexander exhaled but didn't argue.

"Jason, what's the emergency?" Evelyn swirled her wine lazily.

"Ms. Evelyn, Isabella just confirmed she's attending the Vanderbilt gala! She's backing out on us!"

Evelyn took a slow sip. "Interesting."

"Interesting? Nathaniel stole our guest, and you're not worried?"

She smirked. "Let me guess. In the next three days, Vanderbilt will flood the media with invitations. They'll milk this for all it's worth—first international superstar in New York, choosing their hotel. Free publicity. Proves no one can compete with their prestige."

Jason paled. "So this is a massive loss for us."

"Where's the fun in easy victories?" Evelyn's lips curved, red as the wine in her glass. "I live for turning the tables."

Her confidence sent a thrill through Jason.

That look—like a fox circling its prey.

"Evelyn, you already have a plan, don't you?" Alexander asked knowingly.

She nodded. "Jason, proceed with the dinner preparations."

"But—why? Our guest isn't coming!"

Her eyes gleamed. "Who says she won't?"

Outside The Regal Palace.

Gordon hunched in his rented Porsche, tailing Evelyn per Nathaniel's orders.

Just as he was dozing off, Jason stormed out, looking devastated.

Gordon smirked.

Serves them right.

Then Evelyn appeared—followed by a tall, devastatingly handsome man.

Gordon fumbled for his binoculars.

Who the hell was that?

"Come on. I'm taking you for barbecue," the stranger said, slinging an arm around Evelyn's shoulders.

"Extra meat," she demanded, licking her lips.

"Since when did you eat so much?"

"Since forever. And don’t forget the garlic. Barbecue without garlic is a crime."

"Friday night calls for drinks!"

They climbed into a car, shoulders brushing.

Gordon's hands shook as he snapped photos and frantically texted Nathaniel.

[Mr. Vanderbilt! CODE RED! Ms. Sinclair has a new man! And he’s HOT!]

Nathaniel's office.

He was zoning out, scrolling through surveillance photos of Evelyn—her smile, her laugh, the way sunlight caught in her hair.

If he stared hard enough, maybe she'd materialize before him.

Then his phone buzzed.

Once. Twice.

He read the message.

His chair clattered to the floor as he bolted out the door.

At the barbecue joint.

Evelyn and Alexander, reunited after months, were deep in conversation.

After her third drink, Evelyn leaned in. "So, when are you getting married? I need a sister-in-law."

Alexander groaned. "Not you too. Mom's already on my case. My job's dangerous enough—why drag someone else into it?"

She pouted. "All my brothers are single. No nieces or nephews to spoil. It's tragic."

He laughed. "You are the spoiled one. You really want to share us?"
###Chapter 178

"I wish you'd stop spoiling me so much! Because of you guys, I didn't even have a boyfriend until after college!" Evadne's cheeks flushed crimson, her anger rising with her drunken haze.

"Do you remember in school? You knew I loved chocolate, so you'd buy out the entire stock from the school store every single day and wait for me at the gate. All the boys thought you were my boyfriend! Thanks to you, I never even had a first love!"

Aaron chuckled, rubbing the back of his neck. "Oh, I remember that. Mom thought I was secretly dating someone because I kept buying so much chocolate. She even sent someone to ambush me at the school gate, saying she finally had proof and was going to give me a good scolding."

Evadne blinked in shock. "I never knew that! Why didn't you just tell her you were buying snacks for me?"

Aaron sighed dramatically. "Exams were coming up, and Mom had already warned the principal and my homeroom teacher to keep me focused. If I told her I was just buying snacks for my little sister, she wouldn’t have believed me. She was convinced I was sneaking around with some girl."

Evadne rolled her eyes. "You could've at least tried explaining."

Aaron smirked. "Well, after I won first place in the 'Most Eligible Bachelor' contest at school, my locker was constantly stuffed with love letters and gifts. It was exhausting. So, I let Mom think what she wanted—it kept the admirers at bay."

Evadne gasped, poking his forehead. "Wait, so you used me as a shield against your fangirls? Your own sister?"

Aaron grinned unrepentantly. "All things considered, I don’t even want to get married. My job makes me a terrible candidate—anyone who marries me might as well sign up for widowhood."

"Same," Evadne agreed, swirling her drink.

"You should get married, though," Aaron said, lowering his voice. "That guy who came over last time? He couldn’t take his eyes off you all night. You should consider him."

Evadne scoffed. "He looked like he hadn’t seen sunlight in years. Our family has standards, Aaron. I need someone with strong genes to carry on the Ashbourne legacy. Not some pale, sickly guy who might keel over before forty."

Aaron nodded seriously. "Exactly. Health is important. You don’t want to be stuck changing diapers and feeding medicine in your golden years."

Evadne’s lips twisted bitterly. "I’d rather marry someone with a physical disability than a moral one."

Her face burned even redder—whether from the alcohol or the memories, she couldn’t tell.

Outside the barbecue joint, Jason pulled up in the car. Seeing Evadne swaying slightly, he rushed to help.

Aaron tightened his grip on her shoulder, shoving Jason back with his free arm. "Don’t touch her. I’ve got it."

Jason stiffened, lips pressed tight.

He knew Aaron didn’t trust him—any man who got too close to Evadne was automatically suspicious.

"Aaron, relax. Jason’s not a stranger," Evadne groaned, rubbing her temples.

"He’s not a stranger, but he’s still a man," Aaron countered coldly, shooting Jason a warning glare. "You should hire a female secretary. I don’t like you being alone with a guy all the time."

Evadne waved him off. "You’re paranoid because of your job. Not every man is a predator."

"Better safe than sorry."

Aaron helped her into the car, then turned back to Jason, his voice icy. "As Evadne’s secretary, your job is to support her—not entertain fantasies. Remember your place."

Jason’s fists clenched, but he kept his voice steady. "I would never cross that line."

Aaron’s eyes narrowed. "Good. Because if you do, I won’t be as forgiving as my brothers."

Jason exhaled sharply. "You can control actions, not feelings. I love her, but I respect her too much to act on it. Loving someone isn’t a crime."

Aaron studied him for a long moment before nodding. "Just remember what you said."

"Hey! Are we leaving or what? I’m about to pass out!" Evadne called from inside the car.

Jason forced a smile. "Right away, Miss Ashbourne."

"Call me when you get home," Aaron said, making a phone gesture.

Evadne gave him a thumbs-up before the car pulled away.

Aaron watched them go, his smile fading the moment they were out of sight. His gaze flicked to the opposite side of the road, scanning the shadows before he turned and walked off.

Hidden in the darkness across the street, Gordon’s black Porsche idled silently. He’d just sent his location to Thaddeus when, in a blink, Aaron was suddenly yanking him out of the car by his collar.

"W-what the hell?!" Gordon choked, flailing.

Aaron flashed his badge. "Police. You’re under arrest for stalking."

Gordon’s blood ran cold.

Evadne dozed in the car, her phone buzzing her awake.

"Aaron, I’m not home yet. You’re being ridiculous."

His voice was rough. "Evadne, do you know a guy named Gordon?"

She sat up straight, suddenly alert. "Why? What happened?"

Aaron’s tone darkened. "I just caught him. His phone’s full of photos of you."
###Chapter 179

The moment Alexander pulled up to the diner, Isabella and that man were long gone.

His lips pressed into a thin line, his expression hardening at the memory of that photo—Isabella cozying up to some stranger.

Standing there, he felt like a complete fool.

Worry gnawed at him, but so did doubt.

Isabella had been eating at this shady place past midnight with some sketchy guy. Didn’t she realize how dangerous that was?

His phone buzzed abruptly. An unknown number.

Alexander exhaled sharply before answering. "Who is this?"

"Mr. Kingsley?" A woman’s voice.

"Yeah. Speaking."

"This is the Eastern District Police Department. Is Gordon your employee?"

Alexander frowned. "He’s my assistant. What’s going on?"

"We need you to come down to the station. We’ll explain when you arrive."

The night had taken a surreal turn.

As his car sped through the streets, Alexander’s mind raced. He couldn’t fathom how Gordon—who wouldn’t hurt a fly—had ended up in police custody.

He hurried into the station, nearly colliding with a tall man in a sleek leather jacket.

The same man from the photo, touching Isabella like they were close.

Nathaniel spotted Alexander immediately, his sharp gaze cutting right through him.

A smirk curled his lips. "Alexander Kingsley? Here to bail out Gordon?"

Alexander’s glare was icy. "What’s it to you?"

Nathaniel chuckled. "Funny you ask. I’m the one who brought him in. So yeah, it concerns me."

Alexander’s jaw tightened. "Is this some kind of petty revenge?"

"Revenge?"

"You’re targeting my assistant because he caught you with Isabella, aren’t you?"

Alexander was furious. He couldn’t see past the man in front of him, convinced he was just another guy chasing after her.

Nathaniel burst out laughing. "A CEO with that kind of logic? Truly a miracle."

Alexander shot back, "A 'service industry' guy waltzing into a police station playing victim? Bold."

Nathaniel blinked.

What the hell was this guy talking about? Service industry? Did he look like some gigolo?

If anything, with that pretty face and sculpted body, Alexander could probably fetch a high price.

Just then, two officers passed by, nodding respectfully at Nathaniel.

"Captain Sinclair!"

Nathaniel acknowledged them with a casual nod.

Alexander froze.

This wasn’t some thug.

He was a cop.

Captain Sinclair? Isabella Sinclair?

Now that he looked closer, those sharp eyes and defined jawline—they were eerily familiar.

"Nathaniel!"

A familiar voice cut through the tension.

Alexander turned slowly.

Isabella stood a few steps behind him, her gaze colder than ice.

"Isabella, what are you doing here?"

Ignoring Alexander, Nathaniel strode over. "I told you I’d handle this. You should be resting."

"No. This is my fight."

Then she turned to Alexander, her stare so distant it made his chest ache.

Since the divorce, she’d always been like this—cold, detached. Before, it had fueled his resentment. Now, it terrified him.

He’d rather she screamed, hit him, anything but this indifference.

"Isabella," he rasped.

"Alexander. Outside. Now."

She didn’t wait for him, turning on her heel.

Alexander moved to follow, but Nathaniel blocked him.

"Listen, Mr. CEO," Nathaniel said lowly. "We’re in a police station. If you so much as breathe wrong near my sister, I’ll cuff you myself."

"You’re a Sinclair. Then you know about me and Isabella."

Alexander forced his temper down, voice tight. "When she was my wife, we respected each other. Now, you have even less reason to interfere."

Nathaniel scoffed. "In my line of work, men who stalk their ex-wives are either psychos or future felons. Never the harmless type."

Alexander had no retort.

Outside, in the dimly lit alley behind the station, Isabella faced him, shadows stretching between them.

"Alexander."

"Are you drunk?"

Before she could answer, he stepped closer, his broad frame blocking the light.

Isabella instinctively backed against the wall as he leaned in, inhaling the scent of her hair.

"This guy’s strong," he murmured. "Think you can handle him? Remember that night at the club when you got wasted? In three years of marriage, you never touched alcohol."

Her eyes flashed. "I have a high tolerance. I don’t get drunk. I’ve always loved drinking—life’s too dull without it. You just never knew the real me."

"Because you never showed me." His voice was rough with bitterness. "You were never honest."

She tilted her head, lips glinting red under the light. "Alexander, you’re an expert at playing the victim, aren’t you?"

Her words were like knives. "Have you forgotten what kind of husband you were? Even if I had opened up, you wouldn’t have cared. You were done with me. Why would I give you more reasons to hate me?"

Now, she could say it all without hesitation.

But each word tore through him.

All her masks had been for him.

Just like Victoria had played the innocent, faking sweetness—even depression—to manipulate him.

And Isabella? She’d pretended just so he wouldn’t despise her.

The realization was agony.

His throat burned, eyes reddening. But before he could speak, she cut in coldly.

"Alexander, I know why you had Gordon follow me. Evelyn’s wedding is coming. I’m your biggest competition now. Spying on a rival? I get it. But you won the first round. Evelyn chose your event. So why keep tailing me? Why sneak photos of Nathaniel?"

Her voice dripped disdain.

"That’s low, even for you."

That’s low.
###Chapter 180

Evadne clenched her jaw.

The Ashbourne children had always been coddled by Emeric and his three wives, given every privilege to pursue their dreams without restraint.

Once, she had been desperate for love. For Thaddeus, she had abandoned her home, risked everything, and even let him trample over her pride—all for the foolish notion of true love.

Now, she had woken up.

She had returned to the Ashbourne Group, determined to take on the responsibility of inheriting the family business. Not just to atone for past mistakes, but to ensure her siblings could live freely, unburdened by duty.

She refused to let her family's peace be shattered.

Yet here was Thaddeus, shamelessly pushing her limits.

It was unbearable.

"Low?"

The word struck Thaddeus like a blade. His eyes darkened, burning with something dangerous.

In an instant, he pinned her against the wall, his breath hot against her lips. "If I'm so low, then tell me, Evadne—was having Gordon arrested your way of getting back at me?"

Getting back at him?

Fury surged through her. The man was utterly unreasonable!

He had sent Gordon to spy on her. He had been caught red-handed by Aaron. And instead of apologizing, he had the audacity to accuse her?

Unbelievable.

"If it wasn't your doing, why would Aaron arrest Gordon without cause?" Thaddeus demanded, his voice thick with anger. His chest heaved, emotions tangled beyond control. "You hate that I won once, don't you? So you teamed up with your brothers to take me down—to take down the Abernathy Group!"

She smirked, tilting her head. "Jealous? My brothers adore me. What can I say?"

"Evadne!" His jaw tightened.

"You have your precious sisters. Can't I have my brothers?" She arched a brow, her smile sharp enough to draw blood. "If it bothers you so much, why don’t you send your little darlings after me?"

Normally, she’d never stoop to this.

But tonight, with alcohol in her veins and Thaddeus provoking her, she couldn’t hold back.

"Sisters? What are you talking about?" Confusion flickered across his face.

"Don’t play dumb." She shoved at his chest, disgust curling her lip. "I don’t have time for your games, you revolting old man."

His grip tightened.

A memory flashed—Evadne vomiting on him outside a bar, then nearly getting him arrested for harassment. When he’d gotten home, he’d found claw marks raked across his chest, stinging and raw.

Now, her hands were on him again, and his pulse roared in response.

"I’ve said my piece. If you send anyone to follow me again, the police station will be the least of your worries." She pushed harder, her eyes glinting with warning. "Let. Me. Go."

"No." His voice was rough, unyielding.

"This is a police station! Keep this up, and I’ll have Aaron arrest you!"

"Even then, you’re not leaving."

"Why not?"

"What sisters?" he demanded, frustration bleeding into his tone. "I only have Glynnis and Mari. Who else?"

She nearly screamed. This man was impossible!

Just then, Thaddeus’s body tensed. He spun, blocking a strike aimed at his back with lightning reflexes.

Evadne barely had time to gasp before Thaddeus and Aaron were locked in combat, fists flying.

The air crackled with violence.

Thaddeus moved like a storm, every motion precise and lethal. Aaron, though skilled, was outmatched.

Only Elvis and Cassius could rival Thaddeus in combat.

When Thaddeus’s fist halted mid-swing at Evadne’s cry of "Don’t hit Aaron!"—Aaron seized the opening.

His punch landed hard.

Thaddeus staggered, the taste of copper flooding his mouth.

Evadne’s breath caught.

He had listened. He hadn’t fought back.

Aaron pulled her close, glaring at Thaddeus. "Touch my sister again, and I’ll make sure even your mother won’t recognize you."

But Evadne knew the truth—Thaddeus had held back.

In the end, she didn’t press charges. She knew Gordon wasn’t malicious—just blindly loyal.

Back in the car, Gordon slumped like a scolded puppy. "I’m sorry, Mr. Thaddeus. I messed up."

"Forget it," Thaddeus muttered, dabbing his split lip.

"You’re hurt!" Gordon gasped. "That cop hit you? I’ll file a complaint—"

"Innocent?" Thaddeus scoffed. After cornering Evadne, he was anything but.

"Drop it. The cop is Evadne’s brother—Emeric’s son."

Gordon paled. "How many brothers does she have?"

Thaddeus sighed. He’d like to know that himself.

His phone rang.

Edith’s name flashed on the screen.

"Edith," he answered coldly.

"Thad!" Her sugary voice grated on his nerves.

Then it hit him—Evadne’s words: "You have so many sweetheart sisters. Can’t I have a few good brothers?"

So that was why she was angry.

A thrill shot through him.

"Call me by my full name," he interrupted Edith’s rambling.

"What?"

"Your brother is Jareth. Not me."

He hung up, a smirk tugging at his lips.

Evadne was jealous.

And he loved it.
###Chapter 181

Time slipped through our fingers like sand. Three days vanished in the blink of an eye.

Ada's arrival in Elmsworth sent shockwaves through both local and international circles. The media frenzy was unprecedented.

For the grand banquet, Glynnis had meticulously selected an exquisite violet haute couture gown weeks in advance. Every strand of her hair was perfectly coiffed, her makeup flawless - she was determined to outshine everyone.

Elspeth had spared no expense either. Her upswept hair showcased a pair of rare emerald earrings that cost more than most houses. The massive jade pendant around her neck completed the extravagant look.

"Mother," Glynnis tilted her head, "why aren't you wearing the superior quality jade piece from Father's collection?"

Elspeth's face darkened instantly. "Don't remind me! That wretched Stirling family debt forced me to sell it!"

Glynnis gasped. "That was Father's birthday gift to you! I'd be devastated!"

"Trust me, I am," Elspeth hissed through clenched teeth. "Moonlit Treasures hasn't seen a single customer in two months thanks to those new regulations. What choice did I have?"

"But why help the Stirlings at all?" Glynnis frowned. "Shouldn't we let those disgraceful relatives sink on their own?"

Elspeth's lips twisted bitterly. She'd trained Acacia to seduce Thaddeus, never imagining her pawn would turn against her. Now Acacia kept demanding money like some parasitic leech.

Killing her was out of the question - for now. Instead, Elspeth had promised to bring Acacia back to Elmsworth soon, temporarily appeasing the greedy witch.

"How do I look?" Glynnis twirled excitedly in her violet gown. Seeing Jareth in purple recently had inspired her choice. "Tonight, I'll be unforgettable. The Fairhavens won't know what hit them!"

Elspeth adjusted her daughter's plunging neckline even lower. "Forget stealing the show from Ada. Focus on Jareth. What's the point of looking pretty if you can't secure your place in the Fairhaven dynasty?"

With Acacia useless and Mari hopeless, all Elspeth's ambitions now rested on Glynnis' shoulders. Only through her daughter's advantageous marriage could Elspeth gain real power in the Abernathy family.

"Don't worry, Mother," Glynnis preened. "I'll be the next Mrs. Fairhaven!"

Elspeth arched a brow. "Do you have a plan?"

"Jareth's sister Edith just returned from abroad!" Glynnis gushed. "She's agreed to help me. You know how Jareth dotes on her - with Edith's support, how can I fail?"

"Edith?" Elspeth recalled the porcelain-doll girl who used to cling to Thaddeus. "Nothing comes free in this world. What's her price?"

Glynnis grinned. "Edith wants Thaddeus for herself."

"Absolutely not!" Elspeth's shriek could shatter glass. "If Edith marries into the Abernathys, that bastard Thaddeus will become unstoppable!"

"But I'll be allied with the Fairhavens too!" Glynnis protested.

Elspeth's calculating mind whirred. "How serious is Edith about Thaddeus?"

"Hopelessly smitten," Glynnis scoffed. "Though apparently Thaddeus is still hung up on Evadne."

A wicked smile spread across Elspeth's face. "Perfect. This is our chance to drive a wedge between Jareth and Thaddeus!"

Glynnis blinked in confusion.

"Think, girl!" Elspeth tapped her daughter's forehead. "Jareth will inherit Fairhaven Enterprises. If we use Edith to create tension between the brothers, their bond will never recover! Thaddeus won't take what he doesn't want - whether Edith succeeds or fails, the damage will be done!"

Glynnis' eyes lit up with admiration.

A timid knock interrupted them.

Mari peeked in, clutching her teddy bear. "Mother... may I attend the banquet tonight?"

The request stunned both women. Mari never asked for anything.

Glynnis sneered. "Oh? Has my pure little sister finally decided to chase after Jareth again? Still dreaming about that ridiculous kiss in the bushes?"

"I've forgotten about Jareth!" Mari's face paled. "I just want to meet Ada! I love her films!"

"Liar!" Glynnis spat. "You're just another scheming-"

"That's enough," Elspeth cut in coldly. "Mari, you're staying home. And if you interfere with your sister's plans again, there will be consequences."

Mari stood frozen, tears welling. The rejection from her mother and venom from her sister crushed what little dignity she had left.

She was the sick one.
The family embarrassment.
The unwanted daughter.
###Chapter 182

The arrival of Isabella Sinclair at The Regal Palace sent shockwaves through Elmsworth. With the massive promotional campaign from Windsor Estates, every media outlet was buzzing about the global superstar's choice of accommodation.

Lately, The Regal Palace had been drowning in bad press.

Negative publicity might bring attention, but for a luxury establishment like this, it was a disaster they couldn't afford.

For decades, The Regal Palace had been the epitome of excellence, hosting VIPs from politics, business, arts, and sports. Even former President Reginald Blackwood had stayed here during his visits to Elmsworth.

But in the past six months, their reputation had plummeted. Now, the hotel was synonymous with Alexander Kingsley's scandal and Victoria Sterling's cheap antics. Reputation took years to build—and seconds to destroy.

That was why Alexander had pulled out all the stops to secure Isabella's stay—a desperate bid to salvage their image.

He needed this win more than anyone.

Six p.m.

Fans and reporters swarmed outside the hotel, desperate for a glimpse of Isabella.

They even rolled out the red carpet. Extravagant.

"I'm Isabella's biggest fan! I've watched all seven films of The Crimson Reign! Ten years flew by, and now I finally get to see my goddess in person!"

"In Elmsworth, no hotel compares to The Regal Palace! Sure, The Grand Chateau is decent, but it doesn't hold a candle to The Regal Palace in prestige, amenities, or service!"

"Still, their recent controversies leave a bad taste."

"Yet they remain the top choice for the elite. Isabella choosing to stay here is a clear endorsement of The Regal Palace's superiority!"

The bodyguard opened the door of the stretched limousine.

Tonight's star, Isabella, stepped out to deafening cheers.

Isabella, of mixed heritage, had striking chestnut curls and sharp, elegant features. At 5'7", her long legs and poised demeanor made her impossible to miss.

This was her first time in Elmsworth. She hadn't expected such fervent fans, and the warmth put her in high spirits. The usually aloof superstar even flashed a rare smile and waved.

"Isabella! I grew up watching your films!"

"Oh my God, she doesn’t age! She’s flawless!"

Surrounded by her agent and security, Isabella strode inside and took the private elevator to the banquet hall.

Alexander and Nathaniel were waiting. Seeing her, Alexander stepped forward with effortless grace and extended his hand.

"Miss Sinclair, welcome to Elmsworth."

Tonight, Alexander was impeccably dressed, exuding sophistication and power.

His commanding presence matched hers effortlessly.

"Mr. Kingsley." She shook his hand.

"First time in Elmsworth—how do you find it?"

"My mother was from Windhelm, so this city holds sentimental value. It’s my first visit, but I already adore it."

Alexander’s charm and conversational ease put Isabella at ease. They entered the banquet hall, laughing like old friends.

The hall glittered with A-list celebrities.

Isabella’s arrival caused an instant stir. Even the biggest stars couldn’t hide their excitement, rushing to take photos with her.

After all, she was the kind of legend they only saw at the Oscars or Cannes!

Meanwhile, nearly every woman in the room was stealing glances at the devastatingly handsome Alexander Kingsley.

With the former "gatekeeper" Victoria Sterling out of the picture, Elmsworth’s elite socialites and heiresses were vying for his attention. He was the real deal—successful, powerful, and untouchable. The rest were mere pretenders.

Arabella and Lillian, members of the Kingsley family, stood to the side with champagne, relegated to the background. Their forced smiles couldn’t mask their resentment.

"Mother, we’re Kingsleys too. Why are we just extras in Alexander’s show?"

Lillian grumbled, and Arabella’s expression darkened.

As the wife of the Kingsley Group chairman and a former actress, she was accustomed to the spotlight. Being sidelined was unacceptable. So, Arabella plastered on a smile and sashayed toward Alexander and Isabella.

"Miss Sinclair, I’ve heard so much about you. Meeting you is truly an honor."

"Who is this?" Isabella asked Alexander.

"I’m Arabella, wife of the Kingsley Group chairman." She introduced herself with a hint of arrogance.

"Mr. Kingsley, I’m not interested in irrelevant people. Shall we?" Isabella didn’t even glance at Arabella.

Arabella stiffened, realizing Isabella had dismissed her entirely.

Just as she tried to speak again, Alexander chuckled. "We’re in agreement. I don’t introduce insignificant people either."

Arabella stood frozen, humiliated.

Around them, whispers and laughter erupted.

"Wow, Isabella just shut Arabella down! I thought she was just a brilliant actress, but she’s even bolder in person!"

"Laughing so hard right now! Isabella’s an international star—she couldn’t care less about Elmsworth’s petty social climbers!"

"Exactly! Arabella’s power play just backfired spectacularly!"

Arabella’s face twisted with rage, her carefully concealed wrinkles deepening.

But as someone obsessed with appearances, she couldn’t let this slide. Forcing a smile, she retorted, "Miss Sinclair, you must know The Regal Palace and The Grand Chateau are rivals. Your presence here tonight is a clear endorsement of our superiority. As the hostess of the Kingsley Group, I’m deeply honored."

Alexander remained impassive.

Hostess of the Kingsley Group? She really knew how to inflate her own importance.

The atmosphere turned icy.

Nathaniel hurried to translate Arabella’s words to Isabella.

"No, I think you misunderstand." Isabella shook her head. "Both hotels are exceptional. I chose The Regal Palace because Mr. Kingsley impressed me—not because it’s ‘better.’"

Arabella’s cheeks burned as if she’d been slapped.

Isabella might seem arrogant, but she was razor-sharp.

Had she agreed with Arabella’s claim, she’d have alienated The Grand Chateau—a Fortune 500 company—and backed herself into a corner, forcing her to hold her wedding here.

She wasn’t foolish enough to fall for such a transparent trap.

Just as the tension peaked, the banquet hall doors swung open.

Seraphina, draped in a dazzling pink gown, floated in like a fairy, stealing the spotlight.

"Isn’t that the famous pianist Christian’s protégée?"

"She’s not just a pianist—she’s Nathaniel Whitmore’s sister!"

"Wait, Nathaniel’s sister? Does that mean she’s my future sister-in-law?"

"Ugh, if it’s Lillian, I’m out. Just looking at her annoys me."

Lillian sneezed violently.

Seraphina scanned the room eagerly, searching for Nathaniel.

But her hopes were dashed. It seemed fate kept them apart.

Thrilled that all eyes were on her instead of Isabella, Seraphina beamed.

Her real motive for insisting on performing tonight was simple—she wanted Elmsworth’s elite to remember her, not just her brother.

She refused to live in Nathaniel’s shadow.

Lifting her skirt, she glided toward Alexander, her smile radiant.

But Alexander merely watched her, his indifference unsettling.

Then—

Click. Click. Click.

The sharp, decisive sound of heels echoed from the hallway.

Alexander’s breath hitched.

His gaze locked onto the door.

His entire body tensed.
###Chapter 183

Isabella stood poised at the grand entrance of the ballroom.

Her heart raced as she caught Nathaniel's intense gaze fixed upon her.

"Nathaniel." Her cheeks flushed crimson as she approached him with eager steps.

Then the air shifted.

A intoxicating wave of rose perfume enveloped the space - bold, dangerous, utterly captivating.

Click. Click. Click.

The sharp staccato of designer heels echoed through the hall. Isabella froze, her breath catching in her throat under the sudden oppressive atmosphere.

Every eye in the room widened. Even Nathaniel stood transfixed, his dark gaze locked onto Seraphina's striking features.

Her arched brows could've been painted by Renaissance masters. Frosty eyes contrasted sharply with lips like burning embers that seared Nathaniel's soul.

Seraphina's tailored black suit should've made her blend in.

But that face - that impossible, breathtaking face - commanded attention like a queen among peasants.

Murmurs spread like wildfire through the crowd. Seraphina's sudden appearance was the social equivalent of a lightning strike.

Margaret and Victoria exchanged uneasy glances at this unexpected arrival.

"That's her!" someone gasped. "The CEO of Vanderbilt Hotels! She's been all over financial magazines this month!"

"Seraphina Vanderbilt! Daughter of Reginald Vanderbilt himself!"

"The one who's been going head-to-head with Nathaniel Kingsley? She's stunning but looks absolutely ruthless!"

"I study physiognomy - that bone structure screams old money aristocracy."

"Who cares about all that? Look at them together! They're like some power couple straight out of a romance novel!"

Nathaniel usually ignored such gossip. Today, it unsettled him.

Yet that last comment made the tension in his shoulders ease slightly.

Oddly... he didn't hate the idea.

Isabella watched helplessly as Seraphina stole every ounce of attention. Rage blurred her vision, turning her eyes bloodshot.

But what truly shattered her was the way Nathaniel looked at Seraphina.

In all her years knowing him, his gaze had always been as cold and fathomless as the Arctic.

Never like this - burning with barely restrained intensity.

Did he still...?

Could he possibly...?

"Mr. Kingsley, Ms. Prescott," Seraphina's voice cut through the murmurs like velvet-wrapped steel. "I hope you don't mind my crashing your little soirée."

"The pleasure is ours, Ms. Vanderbilt." Nathaniel's lips curved slightly. "Had I known you were coming, I'd have sent a personal invitation."

Seraphina's smile could've powered cities. "No need for formalities, Nathaniel. You know perfectly well I'm not here for the champagne and canapés."

His expression darkened instantly.

Behind him, Lawrence discreetly texted security: [How the hell did she get in?]

[Sir, we have no idea! She just materialized!]

[You had one job!]

[We'll remove her immediately!]

[Are you suicidal? That's Reginald Vanderbilt's daughter! Stand down and monitor the situation!]

"Oh my!" Charlotte gasped dramatically, zeroing in on Seraphina's jewelry. "Is that... Twilight from L'Amour Éternel?"

Seraphina's fingers brushed the exquisite brooch. "Indeed it is."

The crowd had been too mesmerized by her face to notice the seven-figure masterpiece pinned to her lapel.

"L'Amour Éternel! I'd kill to touch that!"

"That yellow diamond alone is worth millions! It's literally museum-worthy!"

"Typical Vanderbilt heir - casually wearing a fortune."

"Margaret's necklace looks cheap in comparison!"

Margaret choked on her champagne.

Cheap? That auction piece had cost Harrison a small fortune! She cursed the Sterling family internally - if not for bailing them out, she wouldn't be suffering this humiliation tonight.

"Ms. Vanderbilt," Charlotte gushed, "I've coveted Twilight since its exhibition debut two years ago! To think it ended up with you!"

Isabella's glare could've melted steel. She couldn't decide what infuriated her more - Seraphina's beauty, her obscenely expensive jewelry, or how Nathaniel couldn't look away from her.

"Two years ago was... difficult." Seraphina's voice softened unexpectedly. "I needed something beautiful to remind me life still held wonder. When I saw Twilight, it felt like... salvation. So I claimed it."

Nathaniel's throat tightened. Two years ago, he'd been commissioning exclusive pieces for Isabella.

Anything Isabella wanted, he'd move heaven and earth to obtain.

Yet for Seraphina... he'd offered nothing.

His constant gaze met only her turned back.

She still resented him.

That resentment meant she still cared.

"L'Amour Éternel pieces aren't just bought with money," Charlotte sighed admiringly. "Your philanthropic work must have impressed them greatly."

With effortless grace, Seraphina unpinned Twilight and placed it on a silk scarf from her pocket.

Then she extended it toward Charlotte.

"Ms. Vanderbilt?!"

"It suits you better." Seraphina's tone brooked no argument. "Consider it a token of our new acquaintance."

The collective gasp could've sucked oxygen from the room.

Margaret, Victoria, and Isabella gaped like fish.

She'd just gifted a million-dollar brooch like it was a Starbucks coupon!

Nathaniel's palms grew damp.

What game was she playing now?

Charlotte looked ready to faint from euphoria.
###Chapter 184

She'd reached out to every connection she had, desperate to acquire a piece designed by the legendary Alea, but all efforts had been futile.

Now, Isabella was offering her this exquisite brooch as a casual gift—Ada could barely contain her excitement!

"No, no, Ms. Sinclair, I truly appreciate your generosity, but this is far too extravagant. I can't possibly accept." Despite the thrill bubbling inside her, Ada forced herself to decline politely.

"This brooch once mended my broken heart," Isabella said softly, her gaze steady. "But now, I've moved beyond the shadows of my past. I won't repeat those mistakes."

A faint smile curved her lips. "Consider this a token of good fortune. It helped me heal. May it bring you the same."

Nathaniel's chest tightened sharply, as if pierced by an invisible arrow.

The fleeting warmth he'd felt moments ago was doused in ice-cold reality.

"Oh! In that case, I'll gladly accept your gift. Thank you so much—I adore it!"

Ada beamed as she took the brooch, her earlier hesitation forgotten.

The crowd watched in disbelief. Was this the same untouchable superstar known for her icy demeanor?

"Why is this happening?" Victoria fumed, turning to her mother. "We spent a fortune setting this up, and now Isabella is stealing the spotlight with some cheap trinket? The Prescotts could afford a hundred of those! Get her out of here!"

"Get her out?" Eleanor's eyes darkened. "Isabella is nothing but bad luck. That little stunt with Ada was a direct insult. Someone needs to put her in her place."

Victoria frowned. Before the divorce, Isabella had been terrified of Nathaniel—one glare from him would leave her trembling for days. Now? She stood fearless, unshaken.

If she'd shown this strength earlier, would things have turned out differently?

"Ms. Sinclair!"

Evelyn couldn't hold back any longer. She stepped forward, her smile strained. "You could've given Miss Ada this gift anytime. Why choose tonight, at the Prescott Hotel's event? Isn't this a bit... excessive?"

Nathaniel's expression darkened as Evelyn spoke.

"Excessive?" Isabella arched a brow. "Are you implying Mr. Prescott can't handle a simple gift exchange? Besides, he's the host. If he has no objections, why should a guest like you?"

Evelyn's face flushed, but she couldn't risk a scene in front of the crowd.

Isabella sighed, turning to Ada. "It seems I'm not entirely welcome here. Understandable, given our families' rivalry. Since my gift has been delivered, I'll take my leave."

She turned to go.

"Ms. Sinclair, wait!"

Ada hurried after her. "I'd love to discuss Alea's designs further. Are you free tonight?"

"Absolutely. The Sinclair Grand has prepared a private dinner. Shall we talk there?"

The room erupted in murmurs.

Had Isabella just openly poached Ada from the Prescott event?

Nathaniel's jaw clenched, fury simmering beneath his skin. He moved to intervene—

"Mr. Prescott," Ada said with an apologetic smile, "I have prior commitments. I must excuse myself early. Enjoy the evening."

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

She was leaving? Just like that?

The rumors were true—Ada was as unpredictable as they came.

"Mr. Prescott," Isabella added smoothly, "you're welcome to join us. Unless, of course, you're too busy entertaining your guests."

Her smile didn't reach her eyes.

Nathaniel's pulse hammered. Before he could respond, Isabella chuckled. "Another time, perhaps."

With that, she and Ada strode out, side by side, leaving stunned silence in their wake.

Nathaniel watched her go, his chest hollow.

First, she'd stolen his project.

Now, she'd taken his guest.

Isabella Sinclair wasn't just an heiress—she was a force of nature.

Outside the Prescott Hotel, reporters lingered despite the cold.

They'd been summoned back by Daniel, promised explosive news.

"This is ridiculous," one grumbled. "What could possibly happen now?"

"Maybe the Sinclair Grand is making another move?"

"Please. The Prescotts own this city. Isabella might be clever, but she's no match for Nathaniel."

A sharp horn cut through the chatter.

A sleek black Rolls-Royce pulled up, cameras flashing instantly.

When Daniel stepped out, the excitement dimmed—handsome, but not headline-worthy.

Then—

"Ada! She's leaving!"

The crowd surged as Isabella and Ada emerged together.

The Prescott Hotel's grand entrance became a frenzy of flashing lights.

"Ada's leaving with Isabella? Nathaniel must be fuming!"

"This is gold! Prescott vs. Sinclair—front-page material!"

As Isabella moved toward the car, a reporter shouted, "Ms. Sinclair! Stealing Mr. Prescott's guest mid-event—isn't that a low blow?"

Isabella paused, her sharp gaze silencing him instantly.

"Since when is inviting someone to dinner a crime?" she countered. "Mr. Prescott is a gentleman. Your insinuations make him look petty, not me."

With that, she slid gracefully into the car. The Rolls-Royce sped away, leaving chaos in its wake.
###Chapter 185

The Abernathy Group's gala was still alive with music and laughter.

But the atmosphere had shifted since Isabella Sinclair made her dramatic exit with the international superstar Ada.

Edith Fairhaven had spent hours perfecting her look, dreaming of dazzling Ada with her talents. Now her chance was gone—vanished along with that cunning vixen Isabella. All her meticulous preparations were for nothing.

That scheming fox had stolen everything!

Outside the grand ballroom, Alexander Kingsley stood like a statue by the floor-to-ceiling windows, his piercing gaze fixed on the empty driveway where the Rolls-Royce had disappeared. His jaw was clenched, his breathing uneven.

"Mr. Kingsley," Gordon ventured cautiously, wiping sweat from his brow. "I hate to say it, but we've been outmaneuvered. The media is buzzing about K Group now. Our event is barely mentioned. And the news of Ms. Sinclair publicly whisking Ada away has reached the chairman. People are questioning our competence—our hotel's reputation is taking a hit."

By the time he finished, Gordon was drenched in nervous perspiration.

This was Isabella's signature move—striking fast and leaving no room for retaliation.

Alexander's voice was rough when he finally spoke. "Since when did you stop calling her Mrs. Kingsley?"

Gordon stiffened. "As long as she doesn't cross you, she's Mrs. Kingsley. The moment she does, she's Ms. Sinclair."

Alexander exhaled sharply, his dark eyes unreadable. "Call her whatever you want. And I'm not angry. This is just how she operates."

Gordon blinked in surprise. Every time Alexander went head-to-head with his ex-wife, he'd end up grinding his teeth in frustration. Yet now, after such a blatant humiliation, he wasn't even upset?

Did he... enjoy this?

"But how did she even get in?" Alexander muttered. "This event was invitation-only. Security was airtight."

Gordon hesitated. "There was a brief system glitch right before her arrival. But our equipment was just serviced—it shouldn't have failed. We suspect a hack."

Alexander's brow furrowed.

A hacker?

Was Isabella capable of that?

Or had one of her brothers intervened again?

"Alex!"

A saccharine voice shattered his thoughts.

Edith rushed toward him, her heels clicking sharply against the marble. Alexander didn't bother turning around.

"Isabella's behavior was outrageous!" Edith fumed, seizing his arm. "She humiliated you in front of everyone! She doesn't respect you at all!"

She knew men like Alexander valued their pride above all. No way would he tolerate such a public slight!

But his response turned her blood to ice.

"You barely know her. Ms. Sinclair has never taken me seriously."

Edith gaped. "Alex, what—?"

"And I don't care."

His frigid stare pinned her in place. "What does concern me, Ms. Fairhaven, is your conduct tonight."

That formal address struck like a slap.

He was distancing himself from her!

"This is an Abernathy event. I was the host. You had no right to represent my company."

"I was trying to help you!" Edith's voice turned shrill. Her grip on his arm tightened. "How could you let that witch sabotage your party? Steal your guest? Make the Abernathy name a laughingstock? What gives her the right? Just because she used to be your wife?"

The moment the words left her mouth, she regretted them.

Alexander's expression darkened. "Who told you about my marriage?"

"My—my brother!" she lied.

"So it was Glynnis." His voice was dangerously soft.

Edith bit her lip hard enough to draw blood.

"What happened between Isabella and me is private. She's moved on. I suggest you do the same."

Rage boiled inside her.

He was defending her! Protecting that woman's reputation!

"Ada's gone. If you're not performing tonight, I can arrange your return to the Fairhaven estate."

He pulled free without another glance and strode away.

Gordon barely suppressed a smirk as he shot Edith a pitying look.

Was this really Jareth Fairhaven's sister?

Her behavior was... unbecoming.

"Alexander Kingsley!"

He didn't stop.

Edith's voice cracked. "Do you still love her? Is that why you defend her?"

Alexander halted. "No. I don't love her."

The answer came too quickly—as if hesitation would betray something he wasn't ready to face.

"Then why? She doesn't love you! She mocks you, steals from you, ruins everything you build! She's evil! Why protect her?"

Her composure shattered with each word.

Edith wasn't like her sister Acacia. Spoiled since childhood, she'd never been denied anything. This was her first taste of defeat—and the more she chased Alexander, the further he retreated.

He turned slowly.

The look in his eyes froze her where she stood.

"Ms. Fairhaven, as someone who's never been married, you wouldn't understand. She was my wife. My tolerance is my prerogative."

Lightning couldn't have struck harder.

"Even if I don't love her, she was mine. No one else gets to judge her."

Rain began to patter against the pavement.

Mari Abernathy slipped out of Windermere Estate, clutching a stuffed bear to her chest. By the time she hailed a cab and reached Abernathy Hotel, her cotton dress was soaked through.

But the bear remained dry.

Trembling with social anxiety, she avoided the grand entrance, sneaking in through the service door.

Head down, she darted through the halls like a frightened mouse, dodging glittering guests.

"Stop right there!"

Her heart leapt into her throat.

Two security guards loomed over her, their expressions dripping with disdain at her bedraggled appearance. "This is a private event. No entry without an invitation."

"I just want to see Ada," Mari whispered. "One look, then I'll go."

"Not happening. Scram!"

The guard grabbed her arm, shoving her toward the exit.

"This isn't a place for charity cases. Get lost!"

Mari's grip on the bear tightened. She would see Ada.

Gritting her teeth, she backed up—then charged straight at the guard!

"Hey—!"

The larger man caught her easily, flinging her aside like a ragdoll.

Mari squeezed her eyes shut, bracing for impact—

Only to land squarely in a pair of strong, familiar arms.
###Chapter 186

The man's striking features were drained of color, his vulnerability making him appear almost delicate. Like a frightened rabbit, he instinctively burrowed into Alexander's embrace.

Alexander's lashes fluttered as an icy sensation gripped his heart.

The dampness from the girl's body seeped through his thin dress shirt, mingling with his own warmth. His breath caught as his arms tightened around her reflexively.

"Miss Isabella?" His voice came out husky, barely above a whisper.

Isabella clung to his shirt with trembling fingers, her eyes squeezed shut. She didn't respond.

"Are you injured?" Alexander murmured, his tone softening.

She pressed her forehead against his chest and gave a tiny shake of her head.

Something warm and unfamiliar bloomed in his chest.

The security guards immediately straightened when they recognized Mr. Kingsley, bowing deeply in respect.

"Good evening, Mr. Kingsley!"

"What exactly happened here?" Alexander demanded, still cradling Isabella protectively.

The more aggressive guard forced a smile. "This young lady is one of Miss Evelyn's fans. She tried to enter without an invitation. We merely stopped her—"

"So you laid hands on her?" Alexander's lips curled into a dangerous smile, his eyes darkening.

"No, sir! We just prevented her from entering." The guard swallowed hard, unwilling to admit they'd manhandled a defenseless girl.

Alexander smirked before whispering to Isabella, "Shall I teach them some manners?"

Isabella kept her face hidden, giving a hesitant nod before shaking her head.

With one arm still around Isabella, Alexander retrieved his phone with his free hand and dialed Sebastian.

"Mr. Lockwood, may I handle some personnel matters regarding the Vanderbilt Group?"

The guards exchanged panicked looks at his words.

Alexander gently stroked Isabella's damp hair. "Good. That makes me feel much better."

He helped Isabella steady herself before making a subtle gesture.

Within moments, Imperial Entertainment's security team surrounded the two confused guards.

Isabella watched in bewilderment as Alexander casually stepped into the circle of bodyguards, disappearing from view when they closed ranks again.

Muffled screams echoed from within the human barricade, making her pulse race.

A minute later, Alexander emerged, coldly observing the bruised men. He accepted a handkerchief from one of his guards to wipe blood from his knuckles.

"You couldn't recognize Miss Isabella of the Vanderbilt family? What use are your eyes?"

The guards turned ashen, immediately bowing to Isabella.

"Miss Sinclair, please forgive us! We didn't recognize you!"

In New York, everyone knew the Kingsley family's influence. Crossing them meant exile from high society.

"I'll handle this minor issue personally. No need to trouble your superiors." Alexander tossed the soiled handkerchief at their feet. "Leave the Vanderbilt Group. Leave New York. If I see you here again, the consequences will be severe."

"Thank you, Mr. Kingsley!"

As the men were escorted away, Isabella stood frozen, biting her lip nervously.

Alexander approached her again, studying her frightened expression. A devilish grin played on his lips. "The Vanderbilt staff didn't even recognize you. You're quite the enigma."

"Was that really necessary?" Isabella whispered, taking a small step back.

"Do you think I was too harsh?" Alexander's eyes narrowed.

Isabella nodded, keeping her gaze lowered.

"But I showed remarkable restraint." Alexander chuckled at her pitiful expression, ruffling her hair. "You're my friend's sister. Of course I'd defend you. This was actually quite mild—I didn't want to frighten you."

Warmth spread from Alexander's palm through Isabella's body as he touched her.

The sensation was unexpectedly comforting, making her close her eyes briefly.

Evelyn, who had just exited the banquet hall, witnessed the entire scene.

She never imagined her meek sister would go this far!

"You little witch!" Evelyn seethed, her nails digging into her palms. "Seducing my man the moment my back is turned!" She nearly charged forward before remembering Alexander's presence might make her outburst unseemly.

After several humiliating lessons, she'd learned to control her temper.

Taking deep breaths, she retreated into the shadows to observe.

Alexander noticed Isabella's soaked hair and mud-stained white dress—clear signs she'd braved the storm to come here.

A pang of protectiveness shot through him as he removed his jacket and draped it over her shoulders.

Evelyn nearly shattered her teeth from grinding them so hard. Seeing Alexander's tenderness toward her sister fueled her burning jealousy.

"How did you get in this state? Didn't the Vanderbilt driver bring you?" Alexander asked with concern.

"I sneaked out. No one knows I'm here." Isabella, incapable of lying, answered truthfully.

"Sneaked out?" Alexander frowned in confusion.

Isabella didn't recognize Alexander's name, nor could she recall their passionate kiss under the stars.

"I'm Alexander Kingsley, your brother's friend." His smirk deepened. "Just call me Alexander."

Alexander?

The name triggered memories of Evelyn's tirades and threats—all centered around one man. Wasn't that Alexander?

The realization struck like lightning, making Isabella recoil in terror.

But Alexander seemed oblivious to her discomfort, instead capturing her cold hand with a laugh. "Let's get you some dry clothes."

"No, thank you."

"Don't be shy. I'm practically family." He gave her hand a reassuring squeeze. "Come on, I'll have someone help you change."

As Alexander led her away, Isabella hesitated.

"Alexander?" Her small hand trembled in his. "Do you treat my sister this way too? She's also your friend's sister."

Evelyn? As if she deserves it!

"No." Alexander looked down at her, his smile radiant. "Only you."

Evelyn heard every word, her rage boiling over.

Her dagger-like glare followed Isabella's retreating figure, promising vengeance.
###Chapter 187

Nathaniel reserved the penthouse suite at The Regal Palace and ordered his assistant to fetch a modest cocktail dress for Isabella immediately.

As Isabella disappeared into the dressing room, Nathaniel lounged on the leather sofa, one leg crossed over the other. His left arm draped casually over the backrest while his right fingers drummed an absent rhythm against his knee.

If he had been wearing a tuxedo, he might have looked like a groom impatiently waiting for his bride.

The door clicked open.

His assistant emerged, beaming, guiding Isabella forward.

"Mr. Kingsley, Isabella is ready."

Nathaniel turned his head, his gaze landing on Isabella in a deep burgundy dress. Her wide, sparkling eyes made her look both innocent and endearingly clueless.

His breath hitched.

Nathaniel had lived a life of extravagance and indulgence. He'd encountered countless women, but never one with eyes so clear they seemed untouched by the world. Staring too long felt like tainting something pure.

"Why such a dated color?" Nathaniel scoffed, eyes still fixed on Isabella's delicate features. "She's young. Couldn't you find something more vibrant? Your taste is appalling for someone who's worked with me this long."

The assistant flushed, knowing Nathaniel's notorious attention to detail. She opened her mouth to apologize—

But Isabella spoke first.

"Nathaniel, I love this color." She tilted her head. "But red really doesn’t suit you. It makes you look... kind of dull."

The assistant choked back a laugh.

Nathaniel's expression darkened.

No woman besides Arabella had ever dared to criticize him so bluntly.

Honestly, he considered himself one of the most handsome men in the country. Only Alexander Kingsley had ever claimed Nathaniel was second-best.

"Only because you're Alexander's sister am I letting this slide," Nathaniel muttered, voice tight.

"Nathaniel... are you mad?" Isabella asked nervously. "Would you get angry if I said you look like a lump of charcoal in red? Would you hit me?"

The assistant bit her lip hard.

Nathaniel—the fantasy of countless women—reduced to a lump of coal in this girl's eyes.

Damn, Isabella. You've got nerve.

Nathaniel glared at her, chest heaving with barely contained irritation. He stood abruptly, his towering frame casting a shadow over her petite form.

Slowly, he leaned down.

Slowly, he raised his hand.

Isabella flinched, squeezing her teddy bear tightly.

Then—

A smirk curled Nathaniel's lips as he flicked her forehead lightly.

"That's right. I'm hitting you. Does it hurt?"

Isabella rubbed her forehead and shook her head.

"Next time you insult me, I won’t be so gentle," Nathaniel warned, though his eyes glinted with amusement.

His assistant stared, stunned.

Meanwhile, the chaos Arabella had caused still required Alexander's intervention.

He left the gala in Gordon's hands and slipped away.

With Arabella gone and Alexander absent, Edith felt her plans crumbling. Frustrated, she downed two glasses of wine before storming onto the stage in her dramatic gown and slamming her hands onto the piano keys.

The abrupt, discordant crash silenced the room.

Guests turned, some scowling.

"What’s wrong with her? That was downright rude."

"Honestly, Ms. Edith has no manners."

Edith, spoiled and used to getting her way overseas, didn’t care. The more she dwelled on Alexander's words, the angrier she became.

But this was Elmsworth. These were high society’s elite. As a Fairhaven heiress, she couldn’t afford to embarrass herself.

Gritting her teeth, she composed herself and launched into Beethoven’s Symphony No. 5, her skilled fingers gliding effortlessly.

The music, rich and emotional, soon captivated the crowd, making them forget her earlier outburst.

Genevieve stormed back into the ballroom, eyes red-rimmed. She grabbed her mother’s arm.

"Mom! Isabella’s here!"

Eleanor startled. "What? Where?"

"I just saw her with Nathaniel Kingsley! He even draped his jacket over her shoulders and touched her hair!" Genevieve hissed, trembling with rage. "Mom, do you really think Isabella’s as simple as she acts? She’s scheming! She’s been eyeing Nathaniel this whole time—she wants to steal him from me!"

"Have you forgotten every ounce of grace I’ve taught you?" Eleanor pinched her daughter’s arm sharply. "Isabella is your sister. She isn’t some villain. Don’t speak like that again."

Genevieve bit her lip hard.

She knew Eleanor wasn’t defending Isabella—she just refused to admit she’d birthed a fool.

"Mom, what do I do?" Genevieve whispered desperately. "Just when we thought Arabella was out of the picture, Isabella shows up! Nathaniel already despises me. How can I marry into the Fairhavens now?"

"Calm down. Isabella won’t ruin this for you." Eleanor’s gaze sharpened. "Find Gordon. Have him track her down and bring her back."

Eleanor didn’t see this as a catastrophe. She controlled her daughters tightly. Even if Isabella was... challenged, Eleanor would still secure her a decent match.

Perhaps even one that could be useful.

"Ms. Edith has quite the temper," Eleanor remarked idly, watching the woman onstage.

"Mom, she’s a nightmare," Genevieve muttered. "Compared to Victoria, she’s a walking time bomb."

"Perfect." Eleanor’s lips curled coldly.

"Perfect?"

"Hot-tempered people are easier to manipulate. All Edith wants is Alexander. She’s privileged, simple-minded, and possessive. That’s all."

Eleanor smirked. "Now, someone like Victoria, who smiles while plotting behind your back? That’s dangerous."

Before she could finish, the ballroom doors swung open.

Edith, lost in her music, didn’t notice the guests’ attention shift—

To Nathaniel Kingsley, guiding a shy Isabella inside.

Murmurs erupted.

"Who’s that girl with Nathaniel Kingsley?"

"Must be his latest fling. His relationships never last longer than a month anyway."

"She’s cute, but I thought he preferred bombshells. Did he suddenly develop a taste for innocence?"

"She’s prettier than Edith and Genevieve combined."

"Face it, none of us have Nathaniel’s wealth or his eye for beauty. That girl beside him? She’s the real deal."

Genevieve’s face burned crimson with humiliation.

Eleanor’s expression soured.
###Chapter 188

"Mom! Didn't I just tell you? I knew those two were up to something! Seraphina is trying to ruin everything between me and him!"

When Glynnis saw Alexander dressing Seraphina in that stunning crimson evening gown, jealousy clawed at her chest. Seraphina's face was fresh and radiant, needing no makeup to look breathtakingly beautiful.

What made it worse? They were both wearing the same deep wine-red shade, looking like some damn power couple.

Under the dazzling lights, standing side by side, they stole every ounce of attention in the room.

Glynnis suddenly hated her own lavender dress—it felt like a slap in the face.

Red and purple? A disastrous clash.

"Seraphina is my daughter. I know exactly what kind of person she is!"

Unlike Glynnis, Elspeth saw the bigger picture. "Even though Seraphina is twenty-two, she acts like a child. She’s not mature enough for romance, let alone scheming to steal your man. Do you really think she has the cunning for that?"

Glynnis simmered down slightly, but frustration still burned inside her.

"I think it’s more complicated than you realize. Alexander was already cold toward you before. After Hamilton’s birthday party, he probably figured out your intentions and started avoiding you. He knows Seraphina is your sister—he’s getting close to her just to spite you."

"What?" Glynnis felt dizzy. "What do I do, Mom? Is there no hope for me to marry Mr. Alexander?"

"Now, more than ever, you need patience. Not only do you have to work with Edith to get closer to Alexander, but you also need to change your attitude. Keep your cool. If he’s nice to Seraphina, you be nice to her too. Show him your sweet, kind side. Understand?" Elspeth’s tone was firm.

"I get it," Glynnis muttered reluctantly.

Meanwhile, not far away—

Seraphina was scanning the crowd for Ada, her eyes bright with excitement.

But when she spotted Edith playing the piano on stage, her expression froze. Her face paled, and the light in her eyes dimmed like a flower wilting in an instant.

Beneath the red dress, her body trembled.

Memories of humiliation and ridicule from her childhood flooded back, drowning her in despair.

"Who would be friends with an idiot like you? What are you even thinking?"

"Throw her in the trash! That’s where she belongs!"

"Cut off her hair! I hate any girl with prettier hair than mine!"

"Even Mr. Frederic and Elspeth don’t love you. Your sister despises you. Do you think you deserve to be called an Abernathy? You’re a disgrace!"

A disgrace. That’s what she was.

On stage, Edith played the piano with full concentration, completely unaware of the venomous glare directed at her from the crowd.

Seraphina’s eyes turned bloodshot as she clutched her teddy bear and began backing away, cold sweat trickling down her forehead.

Suddenly, Alexander grabbed her arm.

"Seraphina, what’s wrong? Are you nervous? Didn’t you say you wanted Ada’s autograph? Come on, I’ll take you to her."

But Seraphina violently yanked her arm free and bolted for the exit without looking back.

"Seraphina! Where are you going?"

Alexander was stunned. Worried she might run into danger, he chased after her.

Glynnis seethed with rage.

Even though Elspeth had told her to stay calm, seeing Alexander care so much for that idiot made her grind her teeth. It was unbearable.

Terror consumed Seraphina as she fled the hotel. She sprinted blindly toward the road, tears streaming down her face.

She had wanted so badly to meet Ada. She’d spent countless lonely nights watching her movies, living vicariously through the fearless heroines who always triumphed.

But seeing Edith in person made her want to disappear.

She was nothing but a burden. A fragile, worthless thing.

The taunts and cruelty chased her like demons from the past.

HONK! HONK! HONK!

A deafening car horn shattered the night.

Blinding headlights bore down on her.

She turned, her face ghostly pale under the glare—

But she froze, unable to move.

The speeding truck couldn’t stop in time. Seraphina hugged her teddy bear tightly, squeezing her eyes shut.

"Seraphina! Watch out!"

At the last second, Alexander lunged forward, wrapping his arms around her fragile body.

Just as she protected her teddy bear, he shielded her with everything he had.

Then, he twisted, taking the brunt of the impact as they crashed onto the pavement.

His shoulder slammed into a jagged rock by the roadside. A muffled groan escaped him as pain radiated through his body, his suit drenched in sweat.

The truck swerved, crashing into a flowerbed. Thankfully, the driver was unharmed.

Alexander was in agony. He released Seraphina—

But to his shock, the ungrateful girl scrambled out of his arms and vanished into the night without a backward glance.

"Hey! Seraphina, come back! At least help me up!"

He was in too much pain to stand, fury boiling inside him.

The hype for tonight’s event had been massive, but the night ended in disaster.

Alexander’s secretary kept the accident under wraps to avoid alarming his family. So instead of leaving immediately, Edith stayed behind with Glynnis at the Abernathy Hotel’s bar.

"Damn it! Thaddeus is obsessed with Evadne!" Edith slammed her glass down, eyes blazing. "If he’s so into her, why did he divorce her?"

"Edith, you’re not the only one confused. I don’t get it either." Glynnis propped her chin on her hand, frowning. "Before the divorce, Evadne was basically a servant in our house—cooking, cleaning, following Thaddeus around like a lost puppy. Three years of that! I can’t even stand cooking for one day. But Thaddeus never cared. He only had eyes for Acacia. Now? Suddenly, he’s chasing after the woman he tossed aside. I used to think he was right, but now? He’s blind."

Edith’s expression darkened further. She scoffed, "Glynnis, are you defending Evadne? Regretting she’s not your sister-in-law anymore?"

"No, no! Edith, you misunderstood." Glynnis quickly backtracked. "I was just trying to help you figure it out. Why was he indifferent before but suddenly interested now? Is it love blooming late? Or is it just that he wants what he can’t have?"

Edith took a furious gulp of her drink, determination burning in her eyes. "I refuse to believe Thaddeus has feelings for Evadne! If he did, why divorce her after three years? He’s just jealous because his ex-wife is thriving now. The more jealous he gets, the more he wants to control her!"

She tossed her hair arrogantly. "Thaddeus and I have a connection. Evadne can’t compete with me. He likes me—he’s just temporarily blinded by her!"

Glynnis rolled her eyes internally but stayed silent.

She always thought Edith was delusional, but she couldn’t afford to offend her. Not when she needed Edith’s help to marry into the Fairhaven family.

"Glynnis, we need to get Ada on board to help Thaddeus secure this project. I’ll back you up."

Edith’s mind flashed to Evadne’s smug face when she flaunted Twilight. Hatred burned in her chest.

"A brooch? Please. Alea has designed plenty. If Evadne can pull it off, so can I!"
###Chapter 189

Wait, what?

Isabella Sinclair actually got her hands on a piece of jewelry that even Gabrielle Moreau—the reigning queen of the jewelry world—couldn’t secure?

Glynnis's shock was instant, but she schooled her expression into something resembling admiration. "Wow, Isabella, you’re incredible! If you can get your hands on Alea’s collection, Gabrielle will have no choice but to come crawling back to us. That’ll be our chance to humiliate Evelyn and do Alexander a favor. And let’s not forget—this will skyrocket your reputation in the Kingsley family. Your relationship with Alexander? About to level up."

Isabella laughed, the sound bright with triumph. "Which means we have to steal this project from Evelyn."

Glynnis nodded along, but her mind was already racing in a different direction.

She had no real interest in helping Alexander. They weren’t blood-related, after all. But this? This was her golden opportunity. If she could snatch the project lead from him, she’d finally prove herself to her father—maybe even salvage her mother’s crumbling reputation.

And Isabella?

Just a pawn in her game.

The thought sent a thrill through her. Desire burned in her eyes, her cheeks flushing with excitement.

"This night has been awful," Isabella whined, her voice dripping with petulance. "Alexander left halfway through, and my brother didn’t even show up. I swear, I’m cutting him off!"

Glynnis smirked. "Oh, but your brother did come tonight, Isabella. He just left again."

Isabella froze. "When?"

"While you were playing the piano. And guess what? He brought my little sister, Lillian, with him. Thanks to Mr. Dominic’s connections, she had the time of her life—center stage, all eyes on her." Glynnis chuckled, watching the shock ripple across Isabella’s face.

"Your sister? That airhead?"

Isabella couldn’t wrap her mind around it. Her brother, Dominic, associating with Lillian?

She knew Lillian all too well.

They’d been classmates at an elite girls’ school years ago.

"Honestly, Isabella, I’m already fighting an uphill battle before I even step foot into the Fairhaven family," Glynnis sighed dramatically, her eyes glinting with cold calculation. "And now? Your brother might actually have feelings for my sister."

Isabella shot to her feet, knocking over her wine glass. "What? That idiot isn’t worthy of Dominic!"

Glynnis feigned distress, pressing a hand to her chest. "But you didn’t see them tonight. Mr. Dominic was so gentle with her. Bought her a new dress, kept saying she was the only one he cared about. I was practically green with envy."

She knew Dominic’s cold, detached personality—there was no way he was serious about Lillian.

But this?

This was the perfect way to manipulate Isabella into dealing with Lillian for her.

Isabella’s anger simmered down slightly as she processed Glynnis’s words. Slowly, she sat back down, picked up her glass, and took a sip. Her eyes darkened with something far beyond her years.

No one knew Dominic better than she did.

And if Glynnis was telling the truth—if he was treating Lillian differently—then this was bad.

Back in school, she’d been the ringleader in making Lillian’s life miserable.

Even after all these years, she doubted Lillian had forgotten.

If Dominic did like Lillian—even just as a friend—her past sins could come back to haunt her. Lillian might use him to exact revenge.

Isabella gritted her teeth. "Don’t worry. As long as I’m around, Lillian and my brother will never be together."

Meanwhile, at The Grand Chateau.

The private dining room was a vision of luxury—ten exquisite dishes, each fit for royalty, paired with rare vintage wine.

Gabrielle Moreau, a self-proclaimed foodie, was in heaven.

Evelyn and Jason kept her company, chatting effortlessly in fluent French. Evelyn steered clear of wedding talk or business, instead discussing films and jewelry collections like old friends.

The atmosphere was perfect.

After dinner, Evelyn and Jason escorted Gabrielle to the underground parking lot.

"Ms. Evelyn, the meal tonight was divine," Gabrielle gushed. "That rose-shaped dessert? Unbelievable! Your chef is a genius."

Evelyn smiled. "That was rose apple pie. If you liked it, I’ll have two boxes prepared before you leave—one for you, and one for your mother."

Jason couldn’t resist adding, "Actually, Ms. Gabrielle, many of the dishes tonight—including the rose apple pie—were made by Ms. Evelyn herself."

Gabrielle’s eyes widened. "What? You made something that intricate yourself?"

She was genuinely moved. A woman of Evelyn’s status—a powerhouse in business—taking the time to cook for her?

That was sincerity she hadn’t expected.

Evelyn shrugged modestly. "It’s nothing special."

Gabrielle hesitated for a moment before suddenly smiling. "Ms. Evelyn, do you have the contract with you?"

Evelyn and Jason exchanged glances. "Ms. Gabrielle...?"

"I want The Grand Chateau to handle my wedding. If that’s possible, I’ll sign right now."

Evelyn’s composure cracked for a split second—just long enough for surprise to flicker in her eyes.

Jason nearly tripped over himself pulling the contract from his briefcase. "Right here! We’ve been carrying it everywhere!"

Evelyn took a deep breath. "Ms. Gabrielle, I have to ask—you wanted us to find a designer who could create unique jewelry for you. I haven’t delivered on that yet. So why choose us now?"

Gabrielle sighed, looking almost guilty. "Honestly? At first, I didn’t want either of you handling my wedding. I only came to New York to fulfill my mother’s wish. So from the start, I was skeptical. Even tonight, accepting your invitation wasn’t entirely sincere—I just picked at random. For that, I apologize. I shouldn’t have been so arrogant."

She met Evelyn’s gaze. "But after tasting the dishes you made for me? That’s when I knew. Your sincerity won me over."

Evelyn blinked.

So her cooking had actually saved the day.

As they settled into the car, Jason handed Gabrielle the contract, grinning like a fool.

Before signing, Gabrielle paused. "Ms. Evelyn, could we add one more condition?"

"Of course. What is it?"

"I want the wedding décor kept secret until the big day. A surprise for my fans—and my mother. Can you do that?"

Evelyn nodded. "Consider it done."

They signed.

Jason exhaled like he’d been holding his breath for weeks.

Gabrielle extended her hand with a smile. "Looking forward to working with you, Ms. Evelyn."

Evelyn clasped it firmly, her eyes gleaming. "The pleasure is mine."
###Chapter 190

The next morning.

Sebastian was in the middle of crisis management when news of Nathaniel's car accident reached him. He abandoned his work immediately and sped to the hospital.

Inside the private ward.

Nathaniel lay motionless on the bed, his neck and waist encased in braces. His lips parted as his assistant carefully fed him sliced apples.

He looked utterly ridiculous—like a pampered prince relishing the attention.

Sebastian strode in, took one glance, and scowled. "Nathaniel, did you win the lottery? You're not even thirty. Why are you acting like you've retired?"

The assistant quickly stepped back, bowed, and slipped out to give them privacy.

"Jesus, Sebastian! Are you here to visit or insult me? How is this acting smug? If I could move, do you think I'd be stuck like this?" Nathaniel winced as he shifted.

"Stop fidgeting. Just stay still."

Sebastian's expression remained icy, but he moved swiftly to adjust Nathaniel's pillows.

"Sebastian, if I end up paralyzed, will you push my wheelchair?" Nathaniel asked mournfully.

"You have an entire harem for that. I don't need to get involved."

Sebastian's tone was flat. "Relax. Even if you're reduced to just a talking head, you'll still be a Vanderbilt. Your lifestyle won't change, and those women will still worship you."

"Hah, true. My charm is eternal." Nathaniel smirked.

Charm? More like his trust fund was eternal.

"How did this happen?" Sebastian's brows knitted together.

"Ask your sister, Arabella."

Nathaniel's chest heaved with anger as he recalled the shadowy figure fleeing into the night. "This is all her fault! She should be the one pushing my damn wheelchair!"

"Nathaniel, what does Arabella have to do with this?" Sebastian's voice turned sharp.

"Your sister showed up at your gala last night. Security nearly turned her away. If I hadn't spotted her, they would've humiliated her—and you'd never have known!"

"Arabella came last night?" Sebastian stiffened.

So that was why Nathaniel had called him out of nowhere.

"I was kind enough to help her change."

"You what?" Sebastian's face drained of color. His voice cracked, fists clenching.

"Not like that! My assistant changed her clothes. I didn't lay a finger on her!" Nathaniel backpedaled fast. He wasn't suicidal. "Then I took her to the ballroom, but she bolted the second we entered. I chased after her because it was dangerous—she ran into the street without looking! A car nearly hit her. I pulled her out just in time, but my back took the hit. Hence... this."

"Was Arabella hurt?" Sebastian demanded.

"Probably not. I was in agony, but she got up and vanished like a ghost. Didn't even help me up! Do I look like some predator to her?" Nathaniel's jaw tightened at the memory.

"Nathaniel, I warned you before. Stay away from Arabella."

Sebastian's gaze turned lethal. "What happened at Grandfather's birthday was an accident. Arabella isn't like you. Don't project your fantasies onto her."

"I was protecting her! Where's your gratitude? Not only are you ungrateful, you're accusing me!" Trapped in bed, Nathaniel could only glare, which looked more pathetic than threatening.

"Who dragged her into the spotlight? Who forced her into that dress? Who made her the center of attention?"

"What are you talking about?" Nathaniel blinked, lost.

"Arabella has severe social anxiety. She's terrified of strangers and crowds." Sebastian's chest ached at the thought of how fragile his sister was.

"Social anxiety?"

Nathaniel froze. A sharp pang shot through his chest, his fingers curling into fists.

No wonder Arabella seemed... different. At twenty-two, she still had the innocence of a child.

That explained why Eleanor kept her sheltered.

"Did you ever ask what she wanted? Or did you just assume?" Sebastian exhaled slowly, his voice raw. "Arabella just wants peace. Don't make her life harder. If you do, you'll break her."

Nathaniel fell silent before rasping, "Can it be treated?"

Sebastian shook his head. If it could, wouldn't she be better by now?

Nathaniel's throat tightened. The memory of Arabella's pale, frightened face flashed in his mind, stealing his breath.

Then Sebastian's phone rang. Frederick.

He hesitated before answering. "Father."

"Come to Vanderbilt Industries. Now. My office."

The call ended. Sebastian stared at the dark screen and laughed coldly.

Was Frederick even his father?

Sometimes he wished blood meant nothing. Maybe then, he wouldn't despise the man so much.

At Vanderbilt Industries, the chairman's office.

The secretary ushered Sebastian inside with palpable tension.

Sebastian halted mid-step.

Frederick sat behind the imposing desk. And beside him—Genevieve.

A shadow crossed Sebastian's eyes. Trouble.

"Sebastian!" Genevieve beamed, her voice sickly sweet, as if they were the closest siblings.

To an outsider, it might have been convincing.

Sebastian gave a curt nod. He'd never played nice with her.

"Sebastian, about last night's incident at the hotel—including how your guest, Camille, was taken by Valentina—Genevieve has filled me in. The internet frenzy, my secretary showed me." Frederick steepled his fingers, his gaze impassive. "Given the damage to our reputation, what's your plan?"

"PR is handling it. By tonight, every negative post will be scrubbed." Sebastian's tone was glacial.

"But the damage is done. The elite circles are already talking. Frankly, it's humiliating." Genevieve feigned concern, her words laced with venom.

Frederick's jaw twitched.

"Every crisis has silver linings. Business is war. As long as Vanderbilt wins in the end, the noise won't matter." Sebastian shot her a withering look. "Short-term thinkers lose big."

Genevieve's nails dug into her palms.

A frantic knock. The secretary burst in.

"Mr. Frederick! You need to see this!"

He handed over his phone. Frederick's face darkened instantly.

"Turn on the news. Now!"
###Chapter 191

The secretary hurriedly switched on the television, tuning it to the breaking news channel.

It was Elite World Report again.

Alexander Kingsley's expression darkened. Ever since losing the Westguard project, this news program had become a bitter reminder of his failures.

"Welcome to Elite World Report! Our top story tonight - international superstar Natalia Petrov has arrived in New York, drawing massive crowds of fans and media attention. Reports indicate Natalia came to fulfill her ailing mother's dying wish - to hold her wedding in her mother's hometown. The prestigious Windsor Estates and The Grand Marquis hotels have been locked in fierce competition to host this event. After days of intense negotiations, Natalia has finally made her choice."

Alexander's throat went dry as he stared unblinking at the screen.

"And the winner is... The Grand Marquis Hotel! Congratulations to The Grand Marquis for securing the rights to host Natalia Petrov's wedding!"

A leaden weight settled in Alexander's chest. His ears rang as a throbbing headache began.

Meanwhile, Victoria Sterling couldn't suppress her smirk.

For her, Alexander's failures only highlighted his incompetence - and increased her own chances of seizing power.

The broadcast then cut to Natalia's exclusive interview explaining her decision.

"Windsor Estates is undoubtedly an excellent hotel," Natalia said gracefully. "But I personally preferred The Grand Marquis' wedding planning proposal. This wasn't about the hotels' capabilities - simply a matter of personal preference."

Nathaniel Prescott couldn't bear to watch another second. He snatched the remote and violently turned off the television, slamming it onto the table.

"Enough! Wallowing in defeat won't change anything. We've lost completely! Not only did we fail to secure the wedding, but our promotional efforts last night ended up benefiting our rivals. How do you plan to fix this disaster?!"

Alexander's face was ashen. Before he could respond, Victoria quickly interjected, "Father, please don't upset yourself. Your health comes first."

She'd learned well from her mother Eleanor - defending Alexander now would only deepen Nathaniel's resentment. "Natalia herself said it was a personal choice, unrelated to Windsor Estates' quality. Alexander did his best. If anyone's to blame, it's that scheming witch Isabella Sinclair. She always finds ways to exploit our weaknesses."

"In business, all's fair in competition. Methods don't matter."

Alexander's icy gaze made Victoria shiver. "Isabella did nothing wrong. We were the ones who dropped our guard."

Victoria's eyes darkened, teeth clenched in frustration. They were already divorced, yet he still defended her. Where was this protectiveness before?

But this worked in her favor. The more he shielded Isabella, the faster he dug his own grave.

"Alexander, did you deliberately lose to Isabella?" Nathaniel demanded coldly.

"No." Alexander lowered his eyes.

"Let me make this clear - you're divorced from Isabella. She's no longer connected to the Prescott family! When you meet, you're business rivals, nothing more! That woman is cunning and ruthless, constantly causing trouble for us. I've tolerated her out of respect for your past relationship, but my patience has limits!" Nathaniel slammed his fist on the table, face flushed with anger.

Alexander stared at his father's furious expression, fists clenched tightly at his sides.

"Alexander! Are you defying me? What's with that look?!"

Nathaniel trembled, an uneasy chill running down his spine.

When Alexander's mother had committed suicide, she'd stared at him with those same cold, ruthless eyes!

Even now, seeing that gaze in his own son unsettled him deeply.

"I may be divorced from Isabella," Alexander said through gritted teeth, taking a threatening step forward, "but even if she's no longer my wife, you will not harm her."

Nathaniel's shoulders shook slightly as father and son stood locked in silent battle.

Victoria too was shaken by Alexander's intensity.

But she forced a calm smile, moving behind Nathaniel to massage his shoulders. "Father, let's not argue over Isabella. She may have won this round, but the game isn't over yet."

"Victoria, do you have a plan to turn this around?" Nathaniel seized on her implication.

"Father, if you give me full control of the Natalia project, I guarantee I'll make that woman regret crossing us!" Victoria declared confidently. "Even though she's announced her choice, wedding venues can always... change, can't they?"

Alexander's expression remained frigid.

He knew his sister well - ambitious but lacking the skill to match. Yet here she was, boldly challenging him as if victory was assured.

Someone was clearly pulling her strings.

"Excellent! This is why you're my most valued daughter - bold and resourceful!" Nathaniel chuckled approvingly, squeezing Victoria's hand. "The wedding project is yours! You'll need to coordinate with Alexander briefly. Alexander, you're stepping back from this one - I don't want your personal feelings interfering again. This is Victoria's show now!"

Alexander stood motionless, offering no response.

When it came to his successes, Nathaniel was stingy with praise. But failures? Punishment came swift and harsh.

First, because he despised this illegitimate son. Second, because he feared being overshadowed.

"Thank you for this opportunity, Father!" Victoria wrapped her arms around Nathaniel's neck, beaming.

"Succeed at this, and you'll be handsomely rewarded!" Nathaniel affectionately ruffled her hair. "What would you like? A beachfront villa? A luxury sports car?"

"Nothing so trivial." Victoria's eyes gleamed. "As your daughter and a Prescott, I want to contribute to our family legacy. If I secure this wedding, I'd like to be appointed General Manager of Windsor Estates. Given the chance, I'll prove my management skills rival Isabella's!"

Alexander's breath hitched, a cold smirk twisting his lips.

So that was her game.

"Done! Succeed here, and you'll have proven your capability. The hotel will be yours!" Nathaniel agreed without hesitation.

"Thank you, Father!" Victoria shot Alexander a triumphant glance, already envisioning his humiliating downfall once she took control.
###Chapter 192

Lucian stepped out of the CEO's office, his polished shoes clicking against the marble floor as he made his way back to his own domain.

"Mr. Lucian! How did it go? Your father didn't give you trouble, did he?" Adrian had already prepared his usual espresso, concern etched across his face as he spoke in a hushed tone.

Lucian sank into the plush leather couch beside his desk, lifting the cup to his lips. His stormy gray eyes darkened.

"He didn't give me trouble."

Adrian exhaled, shoulders sagging in relief.

"That would be impossible," Lucian added flatly.

Adrian's eyes widened, his grip tightening around his own coffee cup. "I knew it! That man never makes anything easy for you. He's a damn snake!"

"I almost wish he were just a snake." Lucian's voice was low, bitter. "At least then I wouldn't be his blood."

The espresso, once rich and bold, now tasted like ash on his tongue. "Unfortunately, biology doesn't lie."

Adrian groaned, dragging a hand through his hair. "What now?"

"Father just handed the Ashbourne wedding project to Giselle."

"What?!" Adrian nearly choked on his coffee. "That was your idea! You spent months planning it, leading the team, pulling all-nighters—and now he just hands it over? That has to be Eloise's doing!"

"It's worse." Lucian's jaw clenched. "If Giselle succeeds, she gets control of the Montclair Hotel."

Adrian's face paled.

That bastard Frederick—useless at running the company but a damn expert at screwing over his own son.

"So you just... let her take it?"

"Would it matter?" Lucian's voice was ice. "Frederick wanted to strip my authority from the start. Giselle just gave him the excuse."

If he let every betrayal raise his blood pressure, he'd have been dead years ago.

"So we do nothing?" Adrian's knuckles whitened around his cup.

Lucian took another sip, silent.

"Mr. Lucian, I hate to say it, but I'm starting to seriously resent Mrs. Montclair!" Adrian scowled.

"You've always respected her before." Lucian arched a brow, amused despite himself. "Changed your mind?"

"Personal feelings aside, this is business. I think she's out for blood. She wants to destroy you!"

"I deserve it." The admission was quiet, painful.

"But at this rate, your position in the company—"

"Won't crumble so easily." Lucian's lips curved, just slightly. "If I were that weak, I wouldn't be worth her attention. And she wouldn't be my wife."

Adrian blinked. "You have a plan?"

Lucian leaned back, eyes closing briefly. A ghost of a smile touched his lips.

"Let Seraphina win."

Adrian gaped.

Then, slowly, understanding dawned.

If they couldn't win—they'd burn it all down together.

"This time, nothing will stand in her way."

Lucian canceled his evening meeting.

The drive to the Celestia Hotel was silent, his mind racing.

The moment he stepped into the lobby, memories assaulted him.

The first time he came here, Seraphina made him climb twenty flights of stairs. Sent a decoy to humiliate him. Left him empty-handed.

No woman had ever made him feel so... powerless.

Even those who betrayed him only ever made him angry.

But her? She left him hollow.

His gaze swept over the newly renovated space—sleek, modern, already outshining the Montclair. A bitter laugh escaped him.

The Seraphina he married had seemed naive. Fragile. A country girl out of her depth in his world.

He never looked down on her for it—but he'd assumed their worlds would never truly align.

Now, he realized the truth.

It wasn't her who couldn't reach him.

It was him, always scrambling to catch up to her.

For three years, she had stripped herself of pride, of dignity, just to stay by his side.

Those were the closest he'd ever been to her.

And he hadn't even realized it.

Across the lobby, Damien was mid-conversation with two executives when he spotted Lucian.

His smile vanished.

"Let's continue this later."

The executives nodded, retreating.

Damien strode forward, expression icy.

"Mr. Montclair. Restaurant's to the left, bar to the right. Need a room? The front desk can help."

"I'm here to see Seraphina." Lucian didn't flinch.

Damien scoffed. "And you think you can just waltz in?"

If this weren't a public space, he'd have thrown him out already.

"Your opinion doesn't matter. I'm seeing her today."

Before, Lucian might have left after the first dismissal.

Not this time.

Humiliation wouldn't kill him. But not seeing her? That might.

"Seraphina doesn't want to see you." Damien's voice dropped to a growl. "Leave. Now."

"I'll leave when she tells me to." Steel laced Lucian's words. "Not you."

"Lucian—"

"Mr. Damien, is Seraphina still busy?"

A smooth voice cut through the tension.

Lucian turned.

Ethan Ashbourne strolled into the lobby, effortlessly elegant.

Two handsome men, standing feet apart. The air between them crackled.

Damien suppressed the urge to scream.

Was this a damn soap opera?

"Mr. Ashbourne," Damien said coldly, "in public, especially here, you will address her as Ms. Montclair."

Lucian smirked.

Ethan didn't miss a beat. "Fine. Is Ms. Montclair free tonight? I'd like to take her to dinner. A thank-you for my mother's signed record."

"Not happening." Damien's glare included both of them.

"I'll wait."

Lucian and Ethan spoke in unison.

They exchanged a glance.

Disgust flashed across both faces.

"Save your breath." Damien folded his arms. "She won't see either of you if you camp here all night."

His earpiece crackled.

A sharp, familiar voice hissed, "Damien. What the hell is going on in my lobby?"
###Chapter 193

Even from a distance, Isabella knew every movement in the bar as if she were there herself.

"Ms. Sinclair, Mr. Kingsley and Mr. Vanderbilt are here. They insist on seeing you."

Daniel pressed the Bluetooth earpiece, his voice hushed as he turned away from the two men.

Both men stiffened, tension coiling in their postures.

"See me? What for? Expecting a discount?" Isabella's voice was icy, devoid of warmth.

"Ms. Sinclair, they refuse to leave unless they speak with you. I can't have security remove them." Daniel shot an uncomfortable glance at Alexander and Dominic.

"Ask them what they want."

Daniel relayed the question with visible irritation.

"I'd like to invite Ms. Sinclair to dinner as a token of gratitude," Dominic said smoothly, adjusting his glasses. "I sent my mother the signed record, and she was delighted. She insisted I extend the invitation personally—she wouldn’t rest otherwise."

A smirk played on his lips as he glanced at Alexander, confident in his approach.

He knew Isabella's kindness, her soft heart. She wouldn’t refuse him.

Not when the alternative was the man who had shattered her.

Daniel turned to Alexander, who simply stated, "Business."

Dominic’s smile faltered.

After a pause, Isabella’s voice crackled through the earpiece. "Bring Mr. Kingsley to me."

Dominic froze.

A slow, triumphant smile curved Alexander’s lips—like a neglected pet finally earning its owner’s favor.

"Mr. Carter, lead the way."

Daniel scowled but turned sharply. "Follow me."

As Alexander walked away, Dominic’s expression darkened behind his glasses. Rage simmered beneath his skin, his fingers curling into fists.

She had chosen him.

The humiliation burned like a brand.

The underground parking lot was silent.

Seeing Dominic return alone, his secretary swallowed hard, opening the car door without a word.

Dominic slid into the back seat, eyes closed, jaw clenched. The air around him was thick with fury.

Isabella had chosen Alexander.

The rejection stung more than he’d ever admit.

"Where to, Mr. Vanderbilt?" the secretary ventured cautiously.

"Did I ask you to speak?"

The secretary stiffened, sweat beading on her brow.

After a long moment, Dominic’s eyes flicked open, cold and calculating.

"Find out everything about the relationship between Alexander and Evelyn Kingsley."

"Evelyn... Kingsley?"

Dominic’s glasses glinted. "Now."

The secretary nodded frantically. "Right away!"

Dominic leaned back, exhaling slowly. "Take me to The Velvet Haven."

The private club had been his foothold in New York for years.

And the woman who ran it?

She had other uses now.

A slow, dark smile curved his lips.

Alexander followed Daniel to the hotel’s kitchen entrance.

He adjusted his tie, stealing a glance at his reflection in the polished steel door.

He had commanded armies, presided over boardrooms—yet nothing had ever made him this nervous.

"Ms. Sinclair will see you now." Daniel stepped aside, disdain clear in his expression.

"Thank you."

Daniel scoffed. "Don’t. If it were up to me, you’d be on the ground."

Then he turned and left.

Alexander inhaled deeply and pushed through the door.

The kitchen was immaculate—sterile, gleaming stainless steel under bright lights.

Silence.

Only his footsteps echoed as he rounded the corner.

And there she was.

Isabella stood at the workstation, petite in her crisp white chef’s coat, hair tucked beneath a cap. A transparent mask covered her face as she meticulously sculpted dough with a pair of scissors.

She was absorbed, unaware of his presence.

Alexander’s chest tightened.

Memories surfaced—Evelyn’s words: "Sir, those pastries you loved? She made every one. Stayed in the kitchen for hours, perfecting them. You never even thanked her."

His throat constricted.

This was the first time he’d seen her like this—focused, skilled.

How much had he taken for granted?

Isabella exhaled, examining the delicate rose-shaped pastry in her hands.

"Finally done."

A soft crunch broke the silence.

Her head snapped up.

Her eyes widened.

"Alexander!" she shrieked. "What the hell are you doing?!"

He chewed slowly, meeting her glare.

Four roses had been on the tray.

Now there were three.

"Spit it out!" Her face flushed with fury.

He took another deliberate bite.

"You bastard! You don’t deserve—"

She lunged for him, but the floor was slick.

Her feet slipped.

She crashed into him.

Alexander’s back hit the counter, pain flaring, but his arms locked around her waist instinctively.

They froze.

Breath mingled through the thin masks.

Her lips hovered dangerously close to his.

His pulse roared.

Control slipped.

And for the first time in years—

He didn’t want to stop.
###Chapter 194

Isabella's eyes widened in shock as she pushed Nathaniel away, stumbling back until her spine hit the refrigerator door.

Her chest rose and fell rapidly, her cheeks burning scarlet. Beads of sweat dotted her forehead.

Even through the mask, she could still feel the heat of his lips against hers. The memory made her flush deeper.

That was completely unacceptable!

Breathless and furious, Isabella tore off her mask and hurled it to the floor.

Ruined. Absolutely ruined.

Nathaniel slowly straightened, leaning against the counter. His gaze was heavy, like a predator who'd just feasted. His lips were slightly parted.

Despite his composed exterior, his pulse hammered wildly in his chest.

"Did I hurt your back?" Nathaniel asked.

His voice was low, distracted, as if still lost in the kiss. But his expression remained unreadable.

"None of your damn business!"

Isabella noticed the empty plate where her homemade pastries had been. Her jaw clenched. "Nathaniel, who gave you the right to eat my food? I didn't make those for you!"

"I missed your baking," he admitted quietly. "You used to make them for me all the time."

Nathaniel wasn't one to indulge in sweets. He often skipped meals when busy.

But seeing Isabella's effort, something primal had taken over. He'd devoured them without thinking.

As if afraid he'd never get another chance.

"Those days are over," she scoffed. "Back then, you were my husband. Cooking for you was my duty. But now? I'd rather feed them to stray dogs than waste them on you."

Nathaniel's chest tightened. His dark eyes clouded.

He searched her face, but the woman who'd once spent hours in the kitchen for him was gone.

Had love really vanished so completely?

Isabella ignored his rigid stance. She strode forward, carefully placed the remaining pastries on a tray, and locked them in the cabinet.

No more stealing.

"I overstepped earlier," Nathaniel murmured. "I didn't realize those pastries meant so much to you. I apologize."

Her lashes flickered. She turned away, scrubbing her hands under the faucet. "Why are you here? Spit it out. I have work to do, and you're wasting my time."

Nathaniel swallowed hard. "I came to tell you—I'm no longer handling Ada's wedding arrangements."

The water ran over Isabella's fingers. She laughed coldly. "Obviously. Ada signed with Kingsley World Hotel. All you're left with is damage control for Abernathy's reputation."

Ignoring her jab, he continued, "Frederic handed everything to Victoria."

Isabella turned, brow arched.

"You're smart. You know this isn't just about the wedding." His voice dropped, laced with concern.

"So you came to warn me?" She smirked, hand on her hip. "How noble. Or are you just bitter about losing and hoping I'll take Victoria down for you?"

Nathaniel's lips twitched.

Oddly, he found her sharp tongue amusing—when it wasn't aimed at him.

"Victoria isn't the real threat," he said. "Elspeth is. She's cunning, unpredictable. I don't want them blindsiding you."

Isabella's gaze hardened. She turned back to the sink.

"I've said what I needed to. I'll leave you to your work."

Nathaniel studied her stiff shoulders before turning to go.

"Wait."

His heart lurched. He spun around.

"Why tell me this?" Isabella faced him, eyes narrowed. "You're not one to sabotage your own family's interests. No matter who handles Ada's wedding, it benefits Abernathy Group. So why help me?"

"Because I want you to win."

Each word was deliberate. His gaze, for once, held no guile.

"Why?"

"I was your husband once."

She barked a laugh. "Three years of marriage, and you never gave an inch. Now that we're divorced, you're suddenly playing knight in shining armor? Get out."

Enough.

Nathaniel coughed, throat suddenly tight.

The Fairhaven Estate

That evening, Edith summoned Victoria to her private study. The door was locked.

"Why the urgency?" Victoria asked, irritated.

"It's been five days since Kingsley World announced their deal with Ada," Edith said coolly. "Have you made progress?"

Victoria bristled. "I'm not a miracle worker. These things take time."

"Luckily for you, I am."

Edith smirked, savoring her superiority. She walked to the piano, lifted the lid, and tossed a file at Victoria's feet.

Victoria bit back her fury and picked it up. A photo of a young woman stared back.

"Caroline Porter. Reporter for The Daily Chronicle," Edith said, idly pressing piano keys.

"Never heard of it."

"Her father was Keith Porter—former deputy manager of Kingsley World. He embezzled funds with Ives until Isabella exposed him. Two-year sentence, but his life is over."

Victoria's eyes lit up. "So Caroline hates Isabella?"

Edith rolled her eyes.

Finally.

"Caroline's family was ruined because of Isabella. Use that."

Victoria's smile turned vicious. "Looks like I need to pay Ms. Porter a visit."
###Chapter 195

The countdown to Isabella's wedding had begun—just fourteen days left.

Lately, Evelyn had been working nonstop, barely catching her breath. She wasn't just adjusting the wedding plans to Isabella's preferences—she was overseeing every detail, from venue decorations to reviewing contracts, budgets, and staffing. Some days, she only managed three hours of sleep.

But she thrived under pressure. The busier she was, the more alive she felt, especially when success was within reach.

After a morning meeting, Evelyn sat in her office, flipping through documents while absently nibbling on a sandwich.

Nathaniel walked in, frowning at the sight. "Ms. Evelyn, you shouldn't work while eating. It's terrible for digestion."

"No choice," she replied without looking up. "I've got an event this afternoon."

"You're booked solid today? I thought you might have some free time."

"Free time?" She scoffed, taking a sip of coffee. "Let's talk about that after the wedding. Right now, I don't have the luxury."

She set her cup down. "Any updates on Victoria and Seraphina?"

"Nothing yet," Nathaniel said. "Do you think they've given up? With everything in motion, they might see no opening."

Evelyn smirked, remembering Alexander's warning. "Stay alert. Victoria clawed her way into this project—she won't back down easily."

A knock interrupted them.

An assistant entered, carrying an elegant white gift box.

"Ms. Evelyn, the pastries you requested from the kitchen are ready, packaged as instructed."

"Thank you. Just leave them there."

Once the assistant left, Nathaniel opened the box, revealing delicate rose-shaped apple tarts. He smiled, recalling how meticulously Evelyn had prepared them.

"We should get going soon," she said. "Go get ready."

That afternoon, Alexander returned to his office after a meeting.

"Mr. Kingsley, there's a jewelry exhibition today. We received an invitation last week. Isabella will be there—shouldn't we attend?"

Before Gordon could finish, Alexander dismissed the idea. "No."

"Are you sure?" Gordon hesitated. "Our reputation took a hit when Isabella chose The Regal Palace over us. If we skip this event, the press will speculate. They're already spinning stories, saying we're avoiding it out of jealousy."

"Victoria can handle it. She's in charge of the Isabella project now."

Alexander's tone was icy. "Birds of a feather flock together. She loves these kinds of events."

"But... Mrs. Sinclair just arrived at the venue."

Alexander's gaze sharpened.

"Get my suit ready. And prepare the car."

Gordon hid a smile. Only when Evelyn was involved did Alexander drop his indifference.

This year’s Aurora Adornments showcase was held at the Elmsworth Convention Center, drawing fashion elites and A-list celebrities. The glamour rivaled an awards ceremony, with Isabella Sinclair as the undeniable star—both the event’s headliner and Aurora’s brand ambassador.

Victoria and Seraphina, as daughters of prominent families, easily secured coveted invitations.

They strutted down the red carpet, lingering far too long for the photographers’ patience.

"If they don’t move soon, I’m deleting every shot," one reporter muttered.

"They think they’re the main event? Pathetic."

Victoria and Seraphina finally entered, only to find the media swarming around Isabella and the designers—not them.

"Are they blind?" Victoria seethed. "I could ruin their careers with one call!"

Seraphina sneered. "If you had actual influence, they’d be falling over themselves for you."

Victoria shot back with saccharine venom. "Oh, darling, you’re the 'Belle of Elmsworth'—yet no one cares. Should I summon some reporters for you?"

Seraphina flushed. "I prefer dignity over desperation."

Their bickering halted when murmurs erupted behind them.

"It’s Evelyn Sinclair!"

"She didn’t even walk the carpet—how did she get in so fast?"

"Unlike some trust-fund brats, she actually has talent."

The reporters rushed past, nearly knocking Victoria and Seraphina over in their haste.

"Watch where you’re going!" Victoria snapped.

But the media only had eyes for Evelyn.

"Ms. Sinclair! You secured Isabella’s wedding over Abernathy Group. How do you feel?"

Evelyn smiled gracefully. "First, I’m honored by Isabella’s trust. Second, Abernathy Hotel remains an industry leader. This competition doesn’t define our relationship."

Her humility won over the crowd.

"Evelyn’s incredible! So poised!"

"Unlike those entitled socialites."

Seraphina trembled with rage. Then she noticed Evelyn’s jewelry—gold rose earrings with ruby accents and a matching ruby pendant.

Victoria gaped, green with envy.

But Seraphina’s eyes narrowed.

A plan formed in her mind.
###Chapter 196

Isabella Sinclair hadn't come to the fashion event today to flaunt her wealth or status. She had two critical objectives to accomplish.

First, she needed to address the media directly and put an end to the swirling rumors about her severing ties with the Vanderbilt Group. This would silence the unnecessary gossip once and for all.

Second, her public gift to Evelyn was actually a strategic move to keep Victoria Sterling in check. She couldn't risk giving that scheming woman any opportunity to cause trouble.

Just then, Evelyn approached with a distinguished middle-aged man in an impeccably tailored brown suit. His regal bearing marked him as someone of importance.

"Ms. Sinclair, allow me to introduce you," Evelyn said eagerly. "This is Mr. Laurent, the global president of Éclat Jewelry and a dear friend of mine. Laurent, this is Ms. Sinclair, the CEO of The Regal Palace. She's quite the remarkable woman!"

Laurent, born into European aristocracy, had golden hair and piercing blue eyes that spoke of his noble lineage.

"Mr. Laurent, the pleasure is mine," Isabella said, her crimson lips curving into a dazzling smile as she extended her perfectly manicured hand.

"The honor is ours to have you at our show, Ms. Sinclair," Laurent replied, his usually aloof demeanor softening slightly as they shook hands.

Evelyn glanced between them, sensing an odd tension. Were they meeting for the first time? The chemistry between them suggested otherwise.

The reporters gasped in shock!

Mr. Laurent, known for his icy aristocratic demeanor, was actually smiling at Isabella Sinclair! The normally unapproachable jewelry magnate seemed positively charmed.

Of course, Ms. Sinclair wasn't just any woman. With her breathtaking beauty and effortless elegance, it was no wonder men fell under her spell.

"What a coincidence running into you here, Ms. Sinclair," came a saccharine voice. Natalie Chen approached in a lavish gown that trailed behind her, her crystal-like eyes and dimpled cheeks giving her an angelic appearance.

Isabella's gaze turned glacial as it swept over Natalie before deliberately ignoring her. "Shall we continue our conversation elsewhere?" she suggested to Laurent and Evelyn.

The blatant dismissal made Natalie's eyes burn with humiliation. How dare Isabella treat her this way when her brother was Alexander Kingsley!

Just as the trio turned to leave, Natalie's voice cut through the air. "Ms. Sinclair, your jewelry today is absolutely stunning. The combination of rubies and rose gold is quite unique. It caught my eye from across the room."

All attention shifted to Isabella.

"Thank you for the compliment," Isabella replied coolly.

"But that jewelry isn't from Éclat, is it?" Natalie pressed, her tone turning sharp.

The crowd murmured as they examined Isabella's pieces more closely. Indeed, while exquisite, they clearly weren't Éclat designs.

This was a serious breach of etiquette at a Éclat event, especially in front of the company president!

"Attending Éclat's show while wearing another brand's jewelry seems rather inappropriate," Natalie continued, her chin lifting in challenge. "Unless... are these from your own line? Using Éclat's platform to promote your own products? How very... enterprising of you. No wonder you managed to outmaneuver Mr. Kingsley in business."

The barbed comments hung in the air as reporters began whispering.

"As head of Sinclair Holdings, she must know better..."

"Clearly doing this intentionally. Businesswomen and their underhanded tactics..."

"I used to admire her, but this is shameless."

Natalie wore a triumphant smirk, convinced she'd exposed Isabella's true colors. Little did she know, Alexander Kingsley had witnessed the entire exchange from the shadows.

The imposing CEO stood watching, his chiseled features unreadable. Dressed in a perfectly fitted suit, he exuded power and danger in equal measure.

"Mr. Kingsley, Ms. Sinclair is being attacked!" Gordon said urgently.

Alexander's lips thinned.

He started forward, then stopped.

"Wait."

"Wait?" Gordon blinked in confusion.

"She's Isabella Sinclair. She always has a plan."

A faint smile touched Alexander's lips, one he didn't even realize he was making. "And if she doesn't... she has me."

Gordon stared, shocked by the uncharacteristic protectiveness from his normally ruthless boss.

"After all, she was my wife. No one else gets to mess with her."

Meanwhile, the situation escalated.

Isabella remained unshaken by Natalie's accusations or the growing murmurs of disapproval. Her composure only infuriated Natalie further.

"Miss," Laurent finally spoke up, his voice carrying authority, "I notice you're wearing Éclat's 'Eternal Bloom' collection, limited to ten sets worldwide."

"Yes, Mr. Laurent! I adore Éclat's designs, especially this series!" Natalie gushed, thrilled to have captured his attention.

"Then you should know the 'Eternal Bloom' was inspired by the 'Golden Rose' collection designed by the legendary Alea."

Laurent's gaze shifted meaningfully to the golden rose earring adorning Isabella's ear.

From his vantage point, Alexander's jaw tightened at the intimate look.

"The jewelry Ms. Sinclair wears today is Alea's original 'Golden Rose.' Without it, there would be no 'Eternal Bloom' you so admire."

The revelation sent shockwaves through the crowd!
###Chapter 197

Not just Isabella and Victoria, even Alexander's friend and Seraphina's obsessive fan, Genevieve, didn't see it coming.

The jewels Arabella was wearing were actually designed by Seraphina! And it was the legendary 'Everose' collection—something Genevieve had only heard rumors about but never laid eyes on!

Envy burned through her like wildfire.

Arabella remained composed, her grateful gaze meeting Alexander's.

She knew words weren't necessary. This was Alexander's domain, and he would handle those with hidden agendas.

Sebastian's piercing stare never left Arabella, his eyes darkening with an unreadable emotion.

He was certain Arabella knew this man—and their connection ran deep.

"Who is that man?" Sebastian demanded, his voice icy.

"Alexander Kingsley, CEO of L'Amour Éternel. His grandfather was the last Duke of Aetheria, and his grandmother founded the brand. In short, the entire empire belongs to his family," Gordon explained.

He added, "Alexander has already inherited the title. He owns estates granted by the royal family and ranks among the top five wealthiest in Aetheria. It's astonishing that Mrs. Lockwood is acquainted with someone of his stature!"

Sebastian's jaw tightened, his fingers curling into a fist.

"Did Alexander just publicly defend Mrs. Lockwood? Does he have feelings for her?"

Gordon's eyes sparkled with gossip. "If he does, she could become a duchess! She's already a tycoon's daughter—now tied to royalty? Mrs. Lockwood is unstoppable!"

"Impossible. He's old enough to be her father. She wouldn’t be interested," Sebastian snapped, his tone final.

Gordon smirked. "I disagree. Mrs. Lockwood might prefer mature men. After all, she chose you, and you're six years older."

Sebastian's glare could have frozen hell over.

There was a difference between six years and two decades.

Gordon gulped, sealing his lips with an exaggerated zipper motion.

The teasing words stabbed at Sebastian like daggers.

He no longer cared about her past deceptions.

Now, he only wondered—why were there so many extraordinary men orbiting her? He felt like he was being left behind.

"Unbelievable! The CEO of a top-tier luxury brand openly admits his designs were inspired by Seraphina? Isn't that embarrassing?"

"Not at all. I respect his honesty. He didn’t claim it was original—just that Seraphina’s work sparked his creativity."

"We did take inspiration," Alexander admitted without hesitation. "Seraphina is aware. The 'Preserved Flower' collection was created with her authorization and input."

The crowd buzzed with shock.

Isabella’s triumphant smirk froze.

"Which is why I’m delighted Ms. Arabella chose to wear Seraphina’s jewelry tonight," Alexander said, his gaze briefly flickering to Arabella before shifting away. "There’s something else Ms. Isabella might not know."

Arabella finally spoke, her voice smooth and amused. "L'Amour Éternel and Seraphina have collaborated for years. There’s an unspoken rule among our VIP clients—anyone wearing Seraphina’s pieces has automatic access to all our events, with front-row seating. Plus, lifetime complimentary maintenance."

She tilted her head. "Ms. Isabella, as a devoted fan, how could you not know this?"

Isabella paled, her lips parting soundlessly.

She owned a few pieces, but membership required annual spending thresholds and financial vetting. She’d never qualified.

Of course she hadn’t known.

Victoria discreetly stepped back, distancing herself from the humiliation.

The reporters’ expressions shifted, their scrutiny turning sharp.

"So Ms. Isabella was just making a scene? How pathetic!"

"Why meddle in others’ affairs when she can’t even manage her own?"

"She thought she had the right to judge just because she bought a few trinkets? She’s not fit to lick Mrs. Lockwood’s boots!"

Boots?

They dared say she wasn’t worthy of Arabella’s boots?

Isabella’s vision blurred with rage.

This was the first time she’d been so thoroughly humiliated.

Arabella didn’t spare her another glance. With Alexander and Genevieve, she strode away, the press flocking behind them.

Left alone, Isabella stood trembling, her face ghostly pale.

"Isabella, we’re in trouble!" Victoria hissed, grabbing her arm. "Sebastian is here!"

"Where?" Panic spiked through her.

"Right behind us. He’s been watching. I don’t know how long he’s been there—or what he saw."

Isabella’s blood ran cold. She turned stiffly.

In the shadows, Sebastian stood like a blade unsheathed—cold, unyielding, his gaze slicing through her.

For a heartbeat, she couldn’t breathe.

"Sebastian."

He didn’t speak. Just shook his head, turned, and walked away.

Isabella stumbled back, her legs weak.

That look—it felt like he’d severed everything between them.

In the restroom.

"That bitch! Why won’t she just die?!" Isabella sobbed, her makeup streaking down her face.

She wasn’t just crying over Arabella’s humiliation of her.

Sebastian had seen everything. There was no explaining this away.

"Exactly! It’s unfair. She doesn’t deserve any of this!" Victoria chimed in, a sly smirk playing on her lips.

"You just stood there! Why didn’t you help me?" Isabella snapped.

"I couldn’t get a word in! You know I’m not good with comebacks. If I had a way to ruin Arabella, I’d have done it already!"

Isabella wiped her tears bitterly. "Any updates from Charlotte? Has she found a weakness yet? She’s useless!"

"Patience. That woman hates Arabella more than we do. She’ll deliver."

As if on cue, Victoria’s phone buzzed.

She grinned, waving it. "Speak of the devil—Charlotte’s calling!"

Isabella’s eyes burned with venom. "This time, I’ll make Arabella choke on her own success. Let’s see how she survives this."
###Chapter 198

The backstage lounge buzzed with quiet energy as Alexander led Isabella and Olivia inside. Crystal champagne flutes clinked softly as they exchanged lighthearted banter.

Moments later, Olivia's agent appeared, whispering about an urgent press interview she couldn't miss.

Once she left, only Isabella and Alexander remained.

"Three years, Isabella." His gaze softened, warm but devoid of playful teasing. "How have you been?"

"Nothing much has changed." She tilted her glass with a faint smile.

"You're different now. There's steel in your eyes." He studied her carefully. "Where did you go? Traveling for inspiration?"

"Not quite. I spent three years gutting fish at a wet market." A dry laugh escaped her, her expression unreadable.

"Still sharp as ever." He chuckled.

Their glasses met with a delicate chime. "When will you reveal you're Isabella Sinclair? Keeping such a talent hidden is criminal."

"Let fate decide. I have bigger battles to fight right now." She smirked. "No need for unnecessary chaos."

"Always calculating. You'd never put yourself at a disadvantage." His grin widened. "We've been friends too long. If you need anything—"

"We're not in Aetheria, Alexander. Your influence doesn't stretch here." Her tone was cool, but he caught the warning.

"Ms. Evelyn has been begging to join Aurora Adornments. The review board is considering her—though she's not quite senior material yet." His eyes glinted with mischief. "And Mrs. Nathaniel and Margaret have been hounding me for their charity galas. I was on the fence, but now? I've made my choice."

Isabella shrugged. "Do what you want. I couldn't care less."

Her indifference was permission.

Anyone who crossed her—man or woman, young or old—would regret it.

As the show's opening loomed, Alexander guided her toward the runway.

They barely took three steps before a voice, cold and commanding, cut through the air.

"Isabella."

Her pulse stuttered. She turned slowly, lips pressed into a thin line.

Nathaniel approached, his expression unreadable under the harsh lights.

Alexander stiffened, sensing the tension. "A friend of yours?"

"Friend?" She scoffed. "Hardly."

Nathaniel wasn't one for social events—unlike his charming brother, Daniel. So why was he here?

Undoubtedly because of his clingy, meddlesome sister.

Nathaniel stopped before them, his gaze locked onto Isabella.

"Aren’t you going to introduce us?"

"Is there a point? The Abernathy Group has no stake in jewelry. You’ll never cross paths." Her voice was ice.

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened.

Ignoring her dismissal, he extended a hand to Alexander. "Mr. Kingsley. A pleasure."

"Mr. Abernathy." Alexander shook his hand firmly. "I had no idea you knew Isabella. Quite the surprise."

"If you were close," Nathaniel’s grip tightened imperceptibly, "you’d know exactly what she is to me."

Alexander frowned, feeling the pressure. This wasn’t a handshake—it was a challenge.

Nathaniel didn’t know what had come over him. He wasn’t petty. But seeing Isabella beside another man sent irrational fury through his veins. He wanted to rip every man away from her.

He was acting like a scorned lover.

And he hated it.

Isabella’s laugh was sharp. "Oh, we have history, all right."

"Nathaniel—" His voice roughened.

"Since when do ex-husbands brag? A decent ex disappears quietly. Or did you forget basic decency?"

Alexander froze.

Ex-husband?

He knew nothing about this. How? Why? She could have had anyone.

"Mr. Abernathy, I tolerate you ruining my mood. But Alexander is important to me." Her glare was lethal. "Don’t test me."

Nathaniel’s chest ached as if stabbed.

She always protected those she cared about—even against him.

Once, he had been her world. Now? He was nothing.

"The show’s starting. Shouldn’t you be babysitting your sister?" She turned to leave.

Nathaniel snapped. His hand shot out, fingers digging into her wrist.

"You’re divorced. Back off." Alexander moved to intervene, but Isabella stopped him.

"Go. You have a speech."

"But—"

"I divorced him. What’s the worst he can do?"

Nathaniel’s grip tightened.

Alexander hesitated but left. This wasn’t his fight.

The hallway was silent except for Nathaniel’s ragged breathing.

"Let go." She twisted free, her eyes glacial.

"I know who you meant. Evelyn, right?"

He yanked her close.

Her body collided with his, warmth searing through fabric.

"I never said her name. Interesting that she’s the first person you thought of." Her smirk was cruel. "Not Glynnis. Not Mari. Just Evelyn."

She was mocking him, throwing Evelyn’s words back in his face.

Nathaniel exhaled sharply.

Women never forgot. And when they were right? They were merciless.

But one question burned in his mind.

"Isabella," his voice dropped, rough. "Are you jealous?"

She laughed outright. "Nathaniel, what delusion are you living in? When I was your wife, you were wrapped around Acacia’s finger. You took her abroad for Christmas. Designed jewelry just for her. You broke me, and I never once cared. Now you dare ask if I’m jealous?" Her smile turned lethal. "Have you no shame?"
###Chapter 199

Thaddeus stood frozen, absorbing Evadne's cutting words like a physical blow to his chest. He couldn't retaliate.

Because she was absolutely right. He had done all those things.

"Evadne, I have no connection with Edith. She's never been my sister!" Thaddeus' ears burned crimson, his voice turning gravelly with emotion.

He wasn't one to justify himself, but this time was different.

"Why tell me this? What does it matter to me?"

Evadne's patience had snapped. Her eyes brimmed with revulsion. "Whatever's between you two is none of my concern. I don't want your explanations. Move. I've got a runway show to attend."

"You claim not to care? Then why bring it up? At the police station and now!"

Thaddeus despised this misunderstanding. His eyes reddened, shoulders trembling. "If my companions bother you, that means you still care! You're not as indifferent as you pretend!"

"I'm not caring. I'm disgusted. Disgusted by you, Thaddeus."

Evadne pried his fingers from her arm with steely determination. "Had I known about your entourage of women, I'd never have fallen for you. Now I'm grateful I left when I did. But it still sickens me that I once loved a man who's faithless and spineless!"

Thaddeus' breathing grew ragged, the pain of being misjudged choking him.

So this was how injustice felt—like having your heart ripped from your chest.

The anguish in Thaddeus' eyes gave Evadne pause.

But she didn't linger. She turned on her heel and walked away without looking back.

"Let the past stay buried," she told herself. "No matter how painful, how passionate, how profound—there's no going back now."

Her phone buzzed—Jason calling.

"Jason, what's wrong?" She fought to steady her voice.

"Ms. Evadne! Check Twitter immediately!" Jason's frantic pitch bordered on hysterical.

A cold dread slithered down her spine.

She pulled up Twitter's trending topics.

Her face drained of color.

"Damn it all!"

Ada Ang's wedding designs had been leaked.

Every meticulously planned detail, every confidential photo—now plastered across the internet for all to see.

Complete exposure.

Thaddeus, still reeling from their confrontation, caught Evadne's curse. First startled, then amused.

She'd become so much more vibrant since leaving him—alive with fire and spirit, infinitely more captivating than the cautious shadow who'd once trailed after him.

He moved toward her.

But she was already sprinting down the corridor in her stilettos, leaving him behind.

Thaddeus' instincts flared. Watching her retreat, he dialed Gordon.

"Mr. Thaddeus."

"Is there an issue at The Regal Palace?"

"Yes, sir! I was just about to report—Ada's wedding setup photos were leaked on Twitter! It's gone viral—top trending topic!"

Thaddeus' brow furrowed. "Who's responsible?"

"An independent media outlet with massive reach. They bypassed all protocols!"

"The audacity! No ethics whatsoever." His gaze darkened.

"Sir, will this affect Mrs. Abernathy?"

"Undoubtedly. Why else would she—normally unshakable—bolt like a startled hare?"

Thaddeus stared down the empty hallway, his pulse racing for her. "I'd wager Ada's contract with Evadne included a non-disclosure clause. Early exposure constitutes breach."

"Breach of contract? That serious?"

"With the designs leaked, The Regal Palace is legally at fault. Even without financial penalties, Ada will certainly choose another venue. And it won't be The Regal Palace." His tone turned grim.

All Evadne's efforts—wasted.

The prestigious Regal Palace—completely out of the running.

"Unbelievable. Mrs. Abernathy's meticulous. How could this happen?"

Thaddeus' jaw tightened, fists clenching.

Normally, he'd relish a competitor's misfortune.

But not today.

"Gordon, investigate that media outlet immediately. Find the leak's source."

The scandal erupted like wildfire.

Show attendees buzzed about it, oblivious to the ramifications. Some even complimented Ada about her "stunning" wedding setup to her face.

Ada's expression darkened by the minute.

She didn't stay for the finale. Didn't greet Alvin. Simply stormed out, avoiding all eyes.

Edith and Glynnis observed everything from their front-row seats.

"Caroline works fast," Edith murmured, her angelic face belying the venom in her gaze.

Ada's abrupt exit confirmed her scheme's success.

"So what if Evadne's the heiress to Skyrim's wealthiest man?" Edith thought smugly. "With ten thousand Alea jewels, you've still been outplayed."

"Caroline's impressively efficient," Glynnis admitted. "Got those shots in record time. Is she really a journalist? More like a spy."

"Don't contact Caroline yet. Leave no trails." Edith's eyes gleamed with triumph. "There, Glynnis—I've cleared your path. Whether you can win Ada over now is up to you."

"Relax. With The Regal Palace's breach, Ada has no choice but to choose us—the Vanderbilt Group." Glynnis puffed up proudly. "Who else in Elmsworth can compete with our resources? Honestly, who?"
###Chapter 200

Isabella Sinclair's heart raced as she rushed through the underground parking lot with Olivia Bennett, her grip tight on the designer handbag.

Ada was already seated in her sleek black limousine, exhaustion evident in her posture as the door began to close.

Then—a hand shot out, stopping it.

"Miss Ada, I understand you're upset about the leaked photos. Believe me, I'm furious too. Windsor Estates had no part in this!"

Isabella's breath came fast, her forehead glistening with sweat.

Ada turned, her practiced smile flawless. "Ms. Sinclair, we have a contract. I know you wouldn’t deliberately breach it. You wouldn’t have Alexander Kingsley’s trust otherwise."

Olivia’s shoulders relaxed slightly. Maybe there was still hope.

But then Ada’s tone shifted, cold and precise.

"However, Windsor Estates has a serious security issue. As general manager, you’re accountable. Today it’s wedding details—tomorrow, client data. This negligence is unacceptable. Wouldn’t you agree?"

Olivia’s fists clenched. She couldn’t stand seeing Isabella treated like this.

Isabella raised a hand, silencing her. "You’re right, Miss Ada. The breach is our failure. I take full responsibility."

"Ms. Sinclair—" Olivia’s voice cracked.

Ada’s smile didn’t waver. "Terminating our contract is the only logical step. Otherwise, what’s the point of agreements?"

The door started closing again.

"Wait!" Isabella thrust forward a velvet box. "Even if we can’t work together, I’d like you to have this. A token of goodwill."

Ada eyed it but didn’t take it. "Another time, perhaps."

The limo pulled away.

Olivia seethed. "That was a slap in the face!"

Isabella exhaled sharply. "She’s protecting her brand. Right now, we have bigger problems." Her gaze hardened. "Someone betrayed us. And I will find them."

She tossed the box into a nearby trash bin.

"If a gift isn’t accepted, it’s trash. Let’s go."

As they left, a shadow moved near the bin.

Nathaniel Kingsley watched Isabella’s retreating figure, then bent to retrieve the discarded box.

"Sir!" Gordon protested.

Nathaniel shrugged. "I’ve done worse."

Back at Windsor Estates, Isabella gathered her team. The air was thick with frustration—some staff were near tears.

She leaned against the conference table, calm. "This isn’t the end. We fix the leak, we move forward. No one’s losing bonuses over this."

The team rallied, refusing to take time off.

Later, Olivia shut the door, whispering, "Why not confront the traitor now?"

Isabella smirked. "Let them sweat. The guilty always slip up when they think they’re safe."

Her phone buzzed—surveillance footage was ready.

Olivia nodded. "I’ll trace the leak."

Isabella’s smile turned razor-sharp. "Good. Hunt them down."
###Chapter 201

The following morning at the Sinclair Holdings headquarters.

Olivia Bennett hurried in, rapping sharply on the office door.

"Mr. Alexander! About that matter you asked me to investigate—oh my God!"

Her words dissolved into an involuntary shriek.

She tried to swallow it back, but it was too late.

Her horrified gaze locked onto Alexander Kingsley seated at his desk, casually extracting a slice of rose apple tart from a filthy, grease-stained box.

Alexander took an enormous bite, his eyes fluttering shut with unmistakable pleasure.

"Mr. Alexander! That was retrieved from the trash—please don't eat it!" Olivia gasped, clutching her chest.

"The box is dirty. The contents are perfectly fine." He took another deliberate bite.

The flavor was exquisite, but the knowledge that these pastries weren't made for him soured the experience.

Once, Isabella had baked these for him daily. He'd taken it for granted. Now he was reduced to scavenging them from garbage bins.

How the mighty had fallen.

"Your findings?" Alexander neatly wrapped the remaining pastry and set it aside.

"After considerable persuasion, that blogger finally disclosed a critical lead!"

"Get to the point."

"He claims he received the wedding photos of Victoria Sterling through an anonymous tip. He's merely a pawn—has no idea who's pulling the strings."

"Have you enrolled in incompetence training recently?" Alexander's lip curled.

"Pardon?" Olivia blinked.

"Because you're excelling at delivering useless information."

Alexander massaged his temples. "This is what you call a breakthrough? No identity for the mastermind? Perhaps you should redirect your bonus to charity."

"Mr. Alexander, wait! I obtained the account details of the informant! I rushed back before investigating further—I'll trace it immediately!" The mention of lost bonuses turned Olivia ashen. She might be single, but her future designer handbag fund was non-negotiable.

"Hand it over. I'll handle this myself." Alexander beckoned impatiently.

"But sir, you shouldn't—"

"If I wait for you, I'll lose the advantage."

His fingers flexed, knuckles cracking. At military academy, he'd trained in cyber tracking, counterintelligence, and decryption—skills now dulled by years of corporate leadership.

When Isabella was still Isabella Sinclair, he'd attempted to hack into her circle, searching for dirt on her mysterious associates.

He'd found nothing. That's when he realized—the people surrounding Isabella were anything but ordinary.

This time, however, he doubted his opponent's caliber. If he couldn't crack this, he might as well retire.

Seeing Alexander's predatory focus, Olivia beamed. "Sir, truthfully—have you fallen for Mrs. Kingsley?"

Alexander's glacial stare could've frozen lava. "Shall I deduct three months' salary to fund your early retirement?"

Olivia's mouth snapped shut.

"For three years... I owed her."

Alexander exhaled sharply, gaze dropping. "I'll repay that debt however I can."

That evening at Isabella's private villa.

Sebastian and Nathaniel, upon hearing of their sister's predicament, abandoned their obligations and raced over.

In the study, Nathaniel hunched over the computer, brow glistening as he tracked the digital footprint of the provided account.

Meanwhile, Isabella lounged on the sofa, savoring the vintage Bordeaux Nathaniel had brought, with Sebastian for company.

Nathaniel scowled at his empty glass. "I drop everything to play tech support, while you two sip thousand-dollar wine? I'm a federal prosecutor, damn it!"

When they ignored him, he groaned, "At least save me a glass!"

"Focus on your task, little brother." Isabella swirled her wine, smirking. "Do well, and I'll gift you my entire cellar."

"I'm a public servant! This constitutes bribery!" Grumbling, Nathaniel resumed typing furiously.

"Isabella, Father's aware of the situation," Sebastian mentioned casually.

Her smile vanished. "Is he waiting for me to crawl home in disgrace?"

"Actually, yes." Sebastian chuckled, tweaking her cheek. "His exact words: 'If petty gossip unsettles her, does anything in this world matter to her?'"

Isabella said nothing.

"Oh, and Father mentioned Victoria's starring in 'The Dark Dynasty Part VIII' next year. The producers approached him for funding through back channels."

Sebastian leaned closer, eyes glinting. "He confided that if you're still displeased, he'll have them recast the lead."

Isabella choked on her wine. Since when did their father have Hollywood connections?

"That's... unnecessary. We breached contract first—Victoria did nothing wrong. No need to ruin her career."

She sighed, frustration simmering. "I'm building my own empire now. Can't rely on family forever. Only way forward? Expose whoever framed me, then humiliate them publicly."

"That's my girl. Eye for an eye."

Sebastian's proud smile warmed as he ruffled her hair. Let her raise hell. If the world burned, the Sinclair brothers would fan the flames.

A phone vibrated on the coffee table.

Isabella glanced sideways—and froze.

"Alexander Kingsley" flashed on the screen.

"Your ex-husband calls," Sebastian sing-songed.

"Ugh. Nightmare fuel." She shoved the phone away.

Suddenly, Daniel Carter burst in, face grim.

"Ms. Sinclair! Alexander's here—at the gates!"

As if on cue, the doorbell chimed.
###Chapter 202

"This isn't a nightmare—it's more like a horror movie." Cassius smirked, swirling his wine glass.

After all, he and Arnold were here to keep their sister company. Even that scoundrel Thaddeus wouldn't dare cause trouble tonight.

Otherwise, the dagger tucked in his belt wasn't just for decoration. Not even divine intervention could save him then.

"Thaddeus actually has the nerve to show up? Get ready for war!" Arnold cursed, eyes locked on the screen, fingers flying across the keyboard.

"War? What kind? A typing competition?"

Evadne exhaled sharply, irritation flashing in her eyes. "I'm the one who summoned this ghost. I'll be the one to send him away."

She strode to the entrance alone and activated the video intercom.

The screen illuminated, revealing Thaddeus' striking features, shadowed with an unreadable chill.

"What do you want?"

Her voice was ice. As if she didn't know him. As if he were just another stranger loitering outside her home.

"Evadne. Come out. We need to talk." He ignored her sarcasm, his tone low and rough.

"And we can't talk like this? Can't see you? Can't hear you?"

A muscle twitched in his jaw. He exhaled sharply.

She was relentless.

"Stop playing games. I need to speak with you."

"Games?" A cold laugh escaped her. "Which part of me slamming the door in your face looks like a game to you?"

His fingers flexed at his sides. "I want to see you."

The words were raw, stripped of pride. As if he'd carved them out of his chest just to say them.

Evadne's breath hitched. She took a step back.

Then, slowly, she smirked.

Once, those words would have shattered her. Once, she would have given anything to hear them.

Now? They meant nothing.

"Thaddeus, the world doesn't revolve around you. You don't always get what you want." She tilted her head, her smile cutting. "You taught me that. Took you three years, but I learned."

His entire body tensed. "Evadne—"

"Looks clear tonight." She glanced at the moon, voice flat. "Last time I went out, I was worried lightning might strike you. This time? Unless it's raining knives, I'm not stepping outside. Leave."

Click.

The screen went black.

Thaddeus stood alone in the darkness, the cold wind biting through his coat.

Evadne climbed the stairs, her chest tight.

She couldn't fathom it. How could the man who'd treated her like a ghost for three years suddenly demand to see her? After everything?

What was there left to say?

She'd wasted enough time on him.

Entering the study, Jason frowned. "Everything alright? He didn't upset you, did he?"

"Please." She scoffed, draping herself over Cassius' shoulders. "As if."

"Did you at least make him suffer?" Cassius grinned, nudging her.

"Not really."

"Shame." He tapped her nose. "Should've let me handle it. I'd have made sure he regretted showing up."

Evadne rolled her eyes. "Cassius, violence isn't the answer."

"Found it!" Arnold suddenly shouted, slamming his hands on the desk. "Celebration time! Break out the good wine!"

Evadne arched a brow. "Jason, grab a bottle from the cellar."

She leaned over Arnold's shoulder, studying the screen. "Who's the leak?"

"Her." He jabbed a finger at the profile. "Caroline Porter. Social news reporter at Pioneer Post. The IP matches perfectly."

"Good work." She smirked. "Though Elvis would've been faster."

"Then why didn't you ask him?" Arnold groaned.

"Busy." She yawned. "Didn't want to bother him."

Arnold gaped. "So I'm just your backup plan?"

Evadne ignored him, scanning Caroline's profile. "A social news reporter suddenly covering my wedding? Suspicious."

"You think someone paid her?" Cassius frowned.

"Either that or blackmailed her." Evadne's eyes narrowed. "Caroline Porter... Why does that sound familiar?"

Then it clicked.

"Keith Porter's daughter."

"Who?" Arnold blinked.

"The ex-deputy manager I fired. The one who went to jail," Cassius supplied.

"Bingo." Evadne crossed her arms. "Now it makes sense. She's after revenge."

Arnold whistled. "Damn. And here I thought she was just being nosy."

"Please. Her father screwed up, not me." Evadne scoffed. "If she wants to blame someone, she should visit him in prison."

Jason cleared his throat. "Ms. Evadne, I confirmed—no outsiders had access during construction. The leak had to be from our team."

"Then we have a traitor." Her gaze sharpened. "Monitor everyone. Especially the men. If anyone contacts Caroline, I want to know immediately."

"Why just the men?" Arnold frowned.

"Because men are weak for pretty faces." Her lips curled. "Present company excluded, of course."

Cassius smirked. "Naturally."

Arnold and Jason nodded vigorously.

Evadne stretched, exhaustion creeping in. "You're all saints compared to him."

Later, thunder cracked through the night, jolting Evadne awake.

She rarely stirred during storms. Tonight was different.

Slipping into a robe, she padded to the window. Rain lashed against the glass, lightning illuminating the garden below.

For a moment, she remembered her mother—how she'd hold her during storms, whispering secrets to the rain.

Then lightning flashed again.

And she saw him.

Thaddeus. Standing in the downpour, staring up at her window.
###Chapter 203

Isabella's blood boiled with fury.

Was that man still lurking outside? What game was he playing now?

Did he seriously think she'd fall for such a pathetic guilt trip?

She turned sharply, ready to storm back to her room—but froze mid-step.

Elmsworth's autumn nights were merciless, the chill biting deep.

Nathaniel had been standing out there for hours, clad in nothing but a thin suit. If he collapsed from hypothermia on her doorstep, she'd have to deal with the police. What a nightmare.

Gritting her teeth, she snatched her phone and dialed his number.

No answer. The line was dead.

Isabella's confusion morphed into irritation.

His little performance wasn't earning him sympathy—just her suspicion.

Grabbing the nearest umbrella, she marched outside.

When Nathaniel saw her approaching through the downpour, he wondered if exhaustion had conjured a mirage.

Only when she stood before him, her glare sharp enough to cut glass, did reality sink in. His chest warmed despite the cold.

"What the hell is wrong with you?" she snapped.

"Aren't you freezing dressed like that?" he countered, ignoring her question.

He moved to shrug off his jacket—then remembered it was drenched. His hands stilled awkwardly.

"Why is your phone off?"

"Dead battery."

His calm reply, paired with that infuriatingly obedient tone, made her scoff. He looked like a scolded husband—and worse, he seemed to enjoy it.

"So you planned to stand here all night unless I came out?"

"Yes. I needed to tell you something."

Isabella barked a laugh. "Nathaniel, you're the CEO of Vanderbilt Industries, not some lovesick teenager. Couldn't you think of a less cliché move?"

"Seeing you was worth it."

His voice was ice, but his eyes burned.

She exhaled sharply, her own clothes now damp under his searing gaze. Thank God for his military discipline—any lesser man might've crumbled.

"Trouble sleeping?"

"What?"

"You never used to wake at night. Slept like the dead."

Her fingers tightened around the umbrella handle.

During their sham marriage, they'd shared a bed for six months. He'd always faced away, an ocean between them.

She knew he was a light sleeper—but never imagined he'd paid her any attention.

"Just say what you came to say. I'm freezing."

"Let's talk in the car."

He took the umbrella, ushering her inside.

The interior smelled of rain and leather.

In the dim light, she noticed his lips trembling slightly, his fingers tinged blue.

Before she could react, he wrapped a blanket around her shoulders.

"I found who's been targeting you. Caroline Porter—Keith Porter's daughter. You know why she'd want revenge."

Isabella blinked. "You came here for that?"

"Partly." His voice was steady, but she caught the faintest tremor. "I needed to see you—to know you're alright."

She laughed, sharp and humorless. "You think some petty scandal could break me? The Sinclair heiress doesn't crumble that easily, Nathaniel. Don't insult me."

"Good." Relief flickered in his eyes.

"Why tell me this?"

She'd never guess the truth—that Nathaniel Kingsley had fallen for her.

After three years of her begging for his attention, only now did he notice her?

Absurd. No one was that oblivious.

"I owe you," he said quietly. "Our marriage was a farce. I failed you."

He searched for logic in his actions, but his chest ached like a knife twisted deeper with each word.

"Make it up to me? Fine."

Her gaze turned glacial. "Then promise me this: stay out of my life. Don't interfere. That's all I want."

Nathaniel's jaw clenched. The pain was visceral, like his heart might stop.

Isabella shoved the blanket back at him. "Save your guilt. If you'd said this was about screwing over Victoria, I might've listened longer."

Watching her vanish into the storm, Nathaniel felt hollow.

The downpour mirrored the emptiness inside.

Some foolish part of him had hoped—just maybe—she'd hesitate.

Now he understood.

This was how Isabella had felt for three years.

Back inside, she leaned against the door, steadying her breath.

The growl of an engine signaled his departure.

She moved to the window—then gasped as warm hands settled on her shoulders.

"Sebastian! You scared me." She forced a smile. "How do you move so quietly?"

"You were distracted."

Her brother sighed, pulling her into a side hug as they stared into the rain.

"Did he leave?"

"Sorry I woke you."

She rested her head on his shoulder. "Nathaniel came to tell me about Caroline."

"That's all?"

"That's all."

Silence stretched between them.

Finally, Sebastian squeezed her shoulder. "Hypothetically—if Nathaniel fell for you now, truly changed... would you give him another chance?"

His voice was gentle but probing. "He was your first love, after all."

"No."

The answer came instantly, bitter on her tongue.

"Sebastian, forgiveness isn't the issue. I'm just... tired. Tired of hoping, of waiting, of tying my happiness to a man who couldn't see me." She exhaled shakily. "I won't relive those years."

"You're right." He kissed her temple. "He doesn't deserve your 'what ifs.' Let him regret it forever."
###Chapter 204

The morning after the K World Hotel debacle, Glynnis Abernathy arrived at the Abernathy Hotel’s presidential suite, dressed to impress.

Ada Fairhaven barely spared her a glance.

To Ada, Glynnis was nothing compared to Evadne—no charm, no wit, no presence.

If not for the Abernathy name, Ada wouldn’t have wasted her time.

"Miss Ada," Glynnis began, feigning concern, "I was devastated to hear about K World Hotel’s breach of contract. Their handling was disgraceful. Leaking client details? Unforgivable."

She didn’t notice Ada’s expression darkening. "Had you chosen us from the start, this wouldn’t have happened."

Ada set her coffee down with a sharp clink. "Are you implying I lack taste?"

Glynnis faltered. "N-No, of course not—"

"Ms. Glynnis," Ada cut in, voice icy, "just because I ended things with K World doesn’t mean I’ll settle for the Abernathy Group. Evadne is exceptional. Maybe she was sabotaged."

Glynnis stiffened.

A warning.

"But you did cancel the contract," she pressed.

"Because integrity matters." Ada’s smile was razor-thin. "Unlike some, I don’t need to tear others down to rise."

Humiliation burned through Glynnis.

She’d assumed the leaked photos would turn Ada against Evadne. Instead, Ada defended her. Was Evadne some kind of witch?

"Your wedding’s soon," Glynnis tried again, desperation creeping in. "If you sign with us now, we’ll expedite everything. Guaranteed perfection."

Ada toyed with her hair. "I’ll consider it—on one condition."

"Name it."

"Thaddeus Abernathy negotiates with me personally. He’s the only one I trust at your company."

——

Glynnis stormed out, fuming.

"Only trust Thaddeus?" The insult stung. She needed a damn exorcist—Evadne had clearly possessed Ada.

She called Elspeth, wailing. "Mom, she humiliated me!"

"That little actress dares disrespect you?" Elspeth hissed. "Go to your father. Thaddeus will comply if he orders it."

——

At Abernathy Group, Glynnis clung to Frederic, recounting Ada’s slights.

"You’re too naive, sweetheart," Frederic sighed, patting her hand. "The world isn’t kind. Learn from this—never let your enemies read you."

He video-called Thaddeus.

The screen flickered to life, revealing Thaddeus’s glacial expression. Glynnis clung tighter to Frederic, flaunting their bond.

Thaddeus ignored her. "What?"

"Ada’s deal is nearly sealed," Frederic commanded. "Finalize it."

Thaddeus smirked. "If Glynnis is so capable, let her handle it. I won’t steal her glorious victory."

Glynnis’s nails dug into her palms.

"She’s your sister!" Frederic snapped. "Help her!"

"No free rides, Father." Thaddeus’s gaze turned arctic. "If you care so much, you grovel to Ada."

He ended the call.

——

Meanwhile, the Fairhavens were in chaos.

Mrs. Jareth had lost the charity auction to Bertha Chambers—thanks to Alvin’s last-minute switch.

Edith Fairhaven seethed.

This was Evadne’s doing.

She called Glynnis. "I’m throwing a party tonight. Let’s drink our misery away."

"Ugh, don’t get me started," Glynnis groaned. "Ada played me. Evadne won again."

Edith smirked, selecting a slinky dress. "Ada’s just saving face. She’ll crawl back."

She twirled before the mirror. "I need a distraction. Got any fun ideas?"

Glynnis paused—then laughed. "Oh, I’ve got plenty."
###Chapter 205

The moment Isabella escaped from Alexander's embrace, sleep became impossible.

Her elbow burned from the scrapes, raw and oozing. The pain was sharp enough to make her bite her lip until it bled.

She couldn't tell anyone—she'd sneaked out. Digging through the first aid kit, she bandaged herself clumsily. Then she curled into bed, clutching her teddy bear, twisting in the sheets until dawn.

Memories flooded her restless mind.

The cafeteria bathroom, where they forced her to eat alone.

The boys lifting her at Evelyn's command, tossing her into the dumpster.

The dead rat in her backpack.

Her favorite novel, shredded by Evelyn's hands, pages scattering in the wind.

The piano in the music room, keys stained with ink.

Nightmares she'd never escape.

Evelyn. Alexander.

Was he really her brother?

Tears streaked Isabella's pale cheeks. She buried her face in the blankets, silent sobs shaking her until morning.

Isabella wasn't naive.

Even if Alexander was Evelyn's brother, he'd saved her. Without him, she'd have died in that car crash.

That afternoon, she crept into the kitchen. Following an online recipe, she baked a blueberry mousse cake. She'd ask Sebastian to deliver it—a thank-you.

Satisfied, she stored it in the fridge, dusted flour off her hands, and turned toward her room.

The door creaked open.

Her smile died.

There sat Victoria, legs crossed, smirking.

A chill crawled down Isabella's spine.

"Cat got your tongue?" Victoria examined her manicure. "Or are you just slow?"

"Victoria." The name tasted bitter.

"Let's go out tonight." Victoria's smile turned saccharine.

"No. I'm not fun." Isabella kept her eyes down.

"Suit yourself."

Victoria stood, oozing mockery. "I was being nice. But if you'd rather stay in your cage..."

She sauntered out.

Isabella exhaled and stepped inside.

Then froze.

Her bed—pillows flipped, blankets torn.

Her teddy bear, Evadne's gift, was gone.

"Victoria!"

Her sister never visited without malice.

She'd taken it.

Isabella bolted downstairs, sweat soaking her shirt.

Outside, Victoria lounged in the car, the butler shutting her door.

"Give it back!" Isabella screamed.

Victoria rolled down the window. With a taunting grin, she dangled the bear.

"Drive."

The engine roared. Tires screeched.

Isabella chased the vanishing taillights. "Victoria! Please!"

She crumpled, a mother robbed of her child. Even the butler winced.

"Get me a car." Her voice was steel.

First time she'd ever commanded like an Abernathy.

"But Ms. Victoria said—"

"I'm Frederic's daughter too!" Her eyes blazed. "Now move!"

The butler scrambled.

Night swallowed the city.

In Sapphire Nights' VIP room, Evelyn held court with Elmsworth's elite. Cigarette dangling, she looked more mob boss than debutante.

Studying abroad had left her with few local friends—just these middle school cronies. All had tormented Isabella under her orders.

"Wonder what the freak's up to," someone drawled.

"Mom says she's mentally ill," another snickered. "Locked up like Rapunzel."

"Explains why she was so weird!"

Evelyn blew a smoke ring. "Autistic, actually."

Peals of laughter.

Evelyn smirked.

The door swung open.

Victoria entered.

Silence.

"Relax," Evelyn waved. "She's with us."

Victoria gaped. Evelyn's act—sweet, refined—was gone.

What would Alexander think of his sister now?

"Where's Isabella?" Evelyn pouted.

"Being difficult." Victoria sighed, then grinned. She held up the bear. "But she'll come."

Evelyn's eyes lit. "New game?"

"Wait and see."

Isabella's car arrived moments later.

The club's neon lights pulsed. Crowds jostled. Her hands shook.

She dialed Victoria.

"What now?" The line buzzed with bass.

"My bear." Isabella's voice cracked.

"That ugly thing? It's hiding."

"Where?"

"Here, obviously." Victoria's laugh was venom. "Find it, or it stays lost forever."

Rage burned Isabella's tears dry.

She stepped into the chaos.
###Chapter 206

The bass from the club's speakers vibrated through the walls, loud enough to stop a heartbeat.

Inside the private suite, silence hung thick in the air.

Alexander Kingsley lounged in the dim lighting, his tailored black suit accentuating his broad shoulders. The top buttons of his silk shirt were undone, revealing a silver cross that glinted with each steady breath. One long leg crossed over the other as he swirled a glass of merlot.

A drop of wine escaped his lips. He wiped it away with deliberate slowness. His posture appeared relaxed, but his piercing gaze could freeze hell over.

Shadowy figures lined the walls - his personal security detail.

Alexander drained his glass and snapped his fingers.

The guards parted like curtains, revealing a bloodied man bound on the Persian rug.

"Mr. Kingsley...please..." The traitor's words came out garbled through broken teeth and swollen lips. Blood and saliva dripped onto the expensive fabric.

"You're ruining my carpet."

Alexander's lip curled in disgust. "This rug costs more than your entire pathetic life. Not even harvesting all your organs would cover the damage."

The man crawled forward, only to be kicked back by a polished Oxford shoe.

"I've served you for years! It was one mistake! Harrison made me do it! All he wanted was your schedule—"

Harrison Kingsley. Alexander's uncle.

When Alexander was seven, his father's private jet went down over the Atlantic. The Kingsley empire should have collapsed, but his father had transferred all assets weeks before the crash - a move that saved them from vultures.

Now Fairhaven Group answered to Harrison. Though Alexander was the rightful heir, his uncle had seized control during their family's vulnerable period.

The same uncle who'd wept louder than anyone at the funeral. The same uncle who pretended to care while plotting against him.

His fragile mother and naive sister Evelyn remained blissfully unaware.

As patriarch, Alexander bore this burden alone. Not even his closest friend Nathaniel knew the truth.

"Pathetic," Alexander murmured. "Do you really think sentimentality will save you?"

The wine glass shattered against the floor. The temperature in the room dropped ten degrees.

The traitor's forehead thudded against the rug in desperate supplication.

"Betrayal is expected. But stupidity? That's unforgivable. Had you committed to your treachery, you might have lived another day."

Meanwhile, in another section of the VIP lounge...

Evelyn had hacked into the club's surveillance system, projecting the feed onto a massive screen for her friends' amusement.

Their entertainment? Isabella Sinclair - lost and panicking like a startled fawn in the pulsing crowd.

Evelyn's posse howled with laughter, drinks sloshing over crystal glasses.

"She hasn't changed since high school!" Evelyn shrieked, pointing at the screen. "I swear she's mentally stunted!"

Below, Isabella desperately searched for her missing teddy bear, getting jostled by intoxicated partygoers. Each time she dodged a grabby stranger, crude insults followed.

The group found it more entertaining than any comedy special.

"Vanessa," Evelyn gasped between laughs, "where did you stash it?"

Vanessa whispered in Evelyn's ear, sending the entire group into fresh hysterics.

"Genius! She'll never—"

Their mockery was cut off as club lights shifted to strobe mode.

Confetti rained from the ceiling, coating the dance floor in colorful paper.

The crowd roared, moving as one intoxicated organism.

"My bear...where's my bear..."

Isabella remained singularly focused, oblivious to the chaos around her.

Then—impact.

Her sweat-slicked face collided with something warm and solid.

Stars exploded behind her eyelids. Pain radiated from her nose as tears spilled over. "I'm sorry!"

She tried to retreat, but the "wall" moved to block her path.

"Please, I didn't mean—"

"Isabella?"

Her heart jackhammered against her ribs. Slowly, she lifted tear-filled eyes.

And found herself staring into Alexander's face - his normally sharp gaze softened by alcohol, yet still impossibly deep.

"This isn't a dream...it's really you."

Without warning, Alexander pulled her into his chest. One arm banded around her waist, the other cradling the back of her head protectively.

The dance floor was no place for someone like her. Too many drunk idiots who wouldn't notice if they crushed her.

Isabella's pulse raced. Her trembling hands fisted in his dress shirt.

She should push away. But after hours of wandering lost, his embrace felt like sanctuary. Just for a moment. Just until she caught her breath.

This was wrong. So wrong.

He was kind. But he was Evelyn's brother.

Around them, clubgoers gasped as they recognized Alexander. His sudden appearance caused more excitement than the DJ's set.

That face launched a thousand tabloid covers.

Those hypnotic eyes were legendary across Manhattan - capable of melting resolve with a single glance.

Right now, those famous eyes were locked onto the girl in his arms.

Lights. Music. Chaos. None of it existed in this bubble.

"You came here alone?" His voice was low, for her ears only.

She nodded. Then shook her head.

"What happened?" Though his expression darkened, his tone remained gentle.

"I lost my teddy bear."

The words tumbled out before she could stop them. Fresh tears followed. "Alexander, it's gone. My sister-in-law gave it to me. It was my favorite."
###Chapter 207

"Alexander." The single word sent an electric current down Alexander Kingsley's spine.

His throat tightened unexpectedly at the sound of his name from her lips.

Tears spilled from her bloodshot eyes, tracing delicate paths down her flushed cheeks. Each droplet seemed to pierce his chest, sending shockwaves through his heart.

All thoughts of her previous disappearance evaporated instantly.

"From your sister-in-law, Evelyn?" Alexander's eyes narrowed as he brushed away her tears with rough fingertips.

Isabella Sinclair nodded, her nose turning an adorable shade of pink.

"Where did you lose it? Here?"

Another timid nod, her lashes fluttering like wounded butterflies.

"Don't worry, little mouse. I'll find it."

Alexander clasped Isabella's trembling hand and led her toward the stage under hundreds of curious stares. A halo of soft pink light followed their path, framing them like subjects in a Renaissance painting.

Isabella kept her gaze lowered but couldn't resist stealing glances at his profile.

Despite his intimidating aura, Alexander was undeniably striking. His chiseled features belonged on a marble statue, too perfect for this mortal world.

She bit her lower lip, committing every angle of his face to memory.

"Music. Off."

Alexander's command at the DJ booth silenced the entire club instantly.

Vanessa Sterling and Gabrielle Moreau were mid-laugh when someone nudged them to look at the screens.

Vanessa shot upright with a shriek that made several people spill their drinks.

Seeing Isabella standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Alexander, their hands entwined like lovers, Gabrielle saw red. Her manicured nails dug into her palms.

That little witch Isabella dared touch what was hers? She'd make her pay.

"What the actual hell? Why is Alexander with that airhead?" Vanessa screeched, rounding on her bodyguard. "I told you to watch her! How did this happen?"

The bodyguard stammered, "M-Ms. Sterling, I did! But Mr. Kingsley wasn't supposed to be at Club Éclat tonight! She was running around like—"

"Useless!"

Vanessa's kick missed and sent her tumbling onto the VIP couch, drawing snickers from her so-called friends.

Meanwhile, Alexander's lips curled into a wicked smile as he addressed the crowd. "Having fun tonight? Let's play a game. My little sister here lost her teddy bear."

The screen displayed the stuffed animal's photo from Isabella's phone.

Murmurs erupted.

"Little sister? Alexander's actual sister is that concert pianist. This girl looks nothing like her."

"Code for 'future girlfriend,' clearly. And you were calling that old man 'brother' earlier. What, distant cousins?"

"She looks so young! Please tell me she's legal."

"Rich guys love the shy, bookish types. Don't you know anything?"

Isabella's cheeks burned. She tried pulling her hand free, her flight instinct kicking in.

But Alexander's grip was iron.

"Whoever finds the bear gets free drinks at Éclat for a year."

The announcement caused pandemonium.

Alexander smirked at Isabella's wide, startled eyes—like a deer caught in headlights.

"Come, little mouse. We'll wait in VIP. Your bear will turn up soon."

He guided her to another private lounge filled with his elite social circle.

The moment they entered, wolf whistles and catcalls erupted.

"Damn, Isabella! Snagging Alexander at your age? Impressive!"

She froze, her face draining of color.

"Shut your mouths. She's my sister. One more word and I'll have you thrown out."

Their laughter died instantly under Alexander's glacial stare.

"So, Alexander," a socialite drawled, "this teddy must be worth a fortune if you're offering a year's worth of Dom Pérignon for it. Could buy a thousand replacements."

"My sister treasures it. It was a gift from my first love. Sentimental value—not that you'd understand." Alexander rolled his eyes at these spoiled brats.

"First love? You mean my sister-in-law?" Isabella gasped.

"Evelyn was my first love, yes." Alexander's smirk held no shame.

He'd fallen hard for Evelyn. Even though she'd chosen Thaddeus, loving such an extraordinary woman was an honor he'd carve on his tombstone.

Isabella exploded. "No! Evelyn belongs to Thaddeus! You're Thaddeus's friend! How could you—" She balled her fists. "If you take her away, I'll never speak to you again!"

Dead silence. Then uproarious laughter.

Isabella turned scarlet, fidgeting with her dress hem.

Alexander chuckled at her adorable outrage before silencing the room with a look.

"Didn't know you had such strong principles, little mouse." He ruffled her hair. "People might think you're jealous."

"Why would I be jealous? I hate bitter things."

Alexander blinked.

Right. They were from different planets.

Yet her world fascinated him.

Club Éclat had descended into chaos, everyone hunting for the stuffed animal.

On the terrace, Isabella wrung her hands while Alexander smoked nearby, the ember glowing like a tiny hellfire.

"Found it! In the men's room toilet tank!" a woman shouted from the stage.

Isabella jumped with joy, her smile brighter than the club's chandeliers.

"Money talks," Alexander muttered, exhaling smoke. "They'd sell their grandmothers for the right price."

"I need to get it!"

She tried to slip past, but Alexander blocked her. After last time, he wasn't letting her vanish again.

"Patience. It's soaking wet. They're drying it first."

"Thank you," she mumbled, avoiding his amused gaze.

"Congratulations!" the hostess announced. "Free drinks for a year!"

The winner nearly fainted. The crowd groaned with envy.

Alexander flicked his cigarette and signaled.

"Mr. Kingsley is covering everyone's tab tonight!"

The resulting cheers shook the building's foundations.
###Chapter 208

"Damn! Alexander is putting on quite the show! I'm signing up for a platinum membership at Midnight Sapphire tonight!"

"Make that a five-year VIP renewal for me! Mr. Kingsley knows how to treat his guests right!"

The crowd buzzed with electric excitement, completely enthralled by the spectacle.

Olivia checked her phone and gasped. The sales team reported record-breaking revenue - the highest single night in club history.

Though Alexander Kingsley had more money than God, he wasn't some reckless playboy wasting cash.

Tonight's extravagant display served multiple purposes - boosting his public image, elevating the club's prestige, and stimulating customer spending all at once.

A masterstroke.

"You're being terribly extravagant, Isabella." She lowered her thick lashes, nibbling her lower lip nervously.

"Worried about my bank account?" His lips quirked in amusement, one aristocratic brow arching.

For her, he'd spent a small fortune without hesitation.

Yet he'd enjoyed every moment - more satisfaction than he'd felt in years.

He couldn't tell if he was trying to impress her or simply indulging himself.

Isabella blinked those luminous eyes, giving a hesitant nod.

"Fascinating. Most women can't wait to spend my money. Yet here you are, fretting over my finances." Alexander leaned against the balcony railing, studying her flushed cheeks with growing interest. "Perhaps you'd like to manage my accounts, little one?"

The whiskey lent his words a dangerous edge.

They stood dangerously close.

Though she missed the implication, she couldn't ignore how his warm breath teased her ear, sending shivers down her spine.

"I'm not a financial advisor."

"There are other ways to handle my assets, Isabella."

His fingers tangled in her silken hair, reluctant to let go.

"Why no more curls? I found them charming."

Her heart clenched. She turned away, eyes glistening.

"I never liked them."

"Really?" Genuine surprise colored his voice.

As her hair slipped through his fingers, an odd emptiness settled in his chest.

"The curls weren't me. But you can call me whatever you like." She lifted her chin, meeting his gaze with startling clarity. "After you saved me tonight - after finding Mr. Snuggles - I owe you. You've earned the right."

Earned the right?

Heat flooded Alexander's veins, his breath catching.

From another woman, this would be blatant seduction.

But from Isabella? It felt pure - like crystal clear water refreshing his jaded soul.

"Mr. Kingsley?"

A waiter entered with a silver tray bearing a dust-covered bottle and two crystal glasses. "Compliments of Mr. Delacroix - a 1998 Pinot Noir from his private cellar."

Alexander nodded dismissal. The moment the door closed, Isabella's eyes lit up like Christmas morning.

"Care for a drink?" He smirked, recognizing that gleam.

"May we?" Her eager expression could melt glaciers.

"Clearly you appreciate fine wine." He caught himself, remembering their first encounter in the gardens. Clearing his throat, he fought down rising heat.

Before he could finish, Isabella had expertly poured, swirling the ruby liquid with practiced ease. She inhaled deeply, examined the legs, then finally took a slow, appreciative sip.

"Tranquil Oasis '98. Deep violet hues. Notes of black cherry, mocha, and vanilla with perfect acidity."

Alexander stared. This girl could paint masterpieces and identify vintages blind?

He owned vineyards across three continents, yet her palate put his to shame. Isabella Sinclair continued to astonish him.

Meanwhile, Victoria and Natalia stewed in jealous rage, itching to drag Isabella out by her hair.

"I warned you!" Natalia sobbed in the restroom, her lash extensions half detached. "She's seducing your brother! Did you see how he mobilized the entire staff for a stuffed animal? When has he ever done that for you - his actual sister?"

She dabbed fake tears, stoking the flames.

Little did she know, Victoria already burned with resentment. "Jareth's never gone to such lengths for me!"

She'd lost countless designer items over the years. Alexander would simply replace them with something more expensive.

She'd believed herself uniquely privileged.

Until tonight.

Her brother - who couldn't be bothered to remember her birthday - had turned Midnight Sapphire upside down for some nobody's toy bear!

The injustice choked her.

"First Thaddeus spoils her rotten, now Alexander? If this continues, she'll eclipse us both!"

"Compete with me? That gutter rat?" Victoria's composure shattered. Stilettos clicking furiously, she stormed out.

The second the door closed, Natalia's tears vanished. Smirking, she reapplied her lashes.

Back in the lounge, Isabella and Alexander had finished their third bottle.

Both floated in that pleasant haze between tipsy and drunk.

Normally reserved, Isabella became remarkably chatty when intoxicated. Her liquor-glossed lips moved incessantly, words tumbling out.

Strangely, Alexander found her ramblings endearing. A rare comfort in his high-stakes world.

"Did you know? Women are biologically predisposed to appreciate color more than men." She took another generous sip. "Extra chromosome receptors for color perception."

"Is that so?"

His gaze darkened as it traveled from her plump lips down to her sneakered feet.

"And they say women are made of water? False! Men are sixty percent water. We have higher fat content!" Her gestures grew increasingly animated. It had been ages since she'd spoken so freely.

Suddenly - darkness.

"Huh?" She blinked owlishly. "Power outage?"

Then - heat. Musk. Racing pulse.

Alexander knelt before her, tilting her chin up. Their lips met in a whiskey-laced collision.

Music swelled as lights flickered back on.

In the strobe flashes, she saw his half-lidded eyes - glittering like cut gemstones.

Beautiful. Dangerous.
###Chapter 209

The dim lighting cast flickering shadows across the room, their movements erratic and unpredictable.

Isabella's slender frame trembled slightly in Alexander's embrace. Her innocence was intoxicating, and the alcohol in his system only fueled his boldness.

Suddenly, her vision blurred as Alexander's towering figure pressed her down.

Her petite body sank deep into the plush couch, trapped like a delicate bird in a gilded cage. Alexander's breath hitched, but his lips never left hers—claiming, tasting, dominating.

The sultry voice of the singer on stage drifted through the air, a haunting melody that only heightened the dizzying haze clouding Isabella's mind. Her eyes shimmered with unshed tears.

"Ah—" Her breath caught as she squirmed beneath him, struggling weakly.

A wicked smirk curled Alexander's lips.

A fire ignited low in his abdomen, his darkening gaze burning with raw desire. He felt like a starving beast, barely holding onto his restraint.

Even drunk, a voice in his head screamed at him—she was his best friend’s sister.

Off-limits.

Forbidden.

Just as he was about to lose control, he reluctantly pulled away, a thin strand of saliva still connecting their lips. Isabella's gaze was unfocused, her mind too clouded to form a coherent thought.

That kiss had intoxicated her more than any liquor ever could.

"Tell me," Alexander murmured, his voice rough as he wiped the wetness from her lips with his thumb. "Was your little theory correct? That women are inherently lustful?"

"You took advantage of me," she whispered, her voice trembling.

"And?" His smirk deepened. "Did I prove your point? Or do you think I'm made of stone?"

Suddenly, an overwhelming wave of exhaustion crashed over Isabella.

Alexander pressed a gentle kiss to her forehead, his breath warm against her ear. "Sleep. Give me your answer tomorrow."

The once-vibrant Isabella was now on the verge of slipping into unconsciousness.

The haunting melody of the song still lingered around her.

BANG!

The door to the private room was violently kicked open.

Evelyn stormed in, her fury palpable. The disheveled men inside froze, their faces paling, while the women shrieked and scrambled behind their partners.

"Who the hell are you?" one of the men demanded, pointing at her.

Alexander had always shielded his sister well—she'd spent most of her life abroad, so few in Elmsworth recognized her.

Fuming, Evelyn marched to the coffee table, snatched an empty wine bottle, and smashed it over the man's head.

CRASH!

Glass shattered. Women screamed. The men stood dumbfounded.

"I'm your damn mother!" Evelyn snarled, her eyes blazing with fury.

"Where did this crazy bitch come from?" another man spat, rising to defend his friend.

"What's the meaning of this?" a third demanded. "What are you trying to do to my baby sister?"

Alexander strolled in from the balcony, cradling the sleeping Isabella in his arms.

Baby sister?

The two men who had stood exchanged uneasy glances before slowly sitting back down.

The one who'd been hit, blood trickling down his temple, forced an awkward laugh.

"My apologies, Ms. Evelyn. A misunderstanding, surely?"

"Alexander!" Evelyn's eyes widened in outrage as she took in the sight of him holding Isabella. "What the hell are you doing?"

"Evelyn," Alexander's voice was sharp, his brows furrowed. "What are you doing?"

"Oh, now you dare question me?" Her voice rose, shrill with anger. "Did I ruin your fun? Is that it?"

"He disrespected you," Alexander said coldly. "Smashing a bottle over his head was justified."

The three men remained frozen, not daring to speak as blood dripped from the wounded man's head.

"But what did I tell you?" Alexander's tone turned stern, the authoritative older brother emerging. "I told you to stay away from Sapphire Nights. If you must come, you inform me first so I can arrange things properly. This place is dangerous. What if something happened to you before I could protect you?"

"Stop pretending to care!" Evelyn snapped, jabbing a finger at him. "Admit it—you're just pissed because I interrupted your little game! Isabella is Nathaniel's sister, and you dare mess with her behind his back? You're shameless!"

"Evelyn." His voice dropped dangerously.

She flinched, taking half a step back.

He never used her full name.

He was furious.

"Go home. Now." His dismissal was sharp, final.

"I'll go," she hissed. "But you're coming with me!"

He glanced down at Isabella, still asleep in his arms. "I'm not going home tonight. Leave. Now."

"What are you planning to do?" Her voice rose to a shriek, making the others wince.

"Lily!" Alexander barked.

His secretary and personal bodyguard, Lily, hurried in.

"Escort Evelyn out. Take her home personally."

"Yes, sir."

Lily obeyed without hesitation.

She grabbed Evelyn's arm, her grip unyielding, and began dragging her toward the door.

"Let go of me! Do you know who I am?! You're hurting me!"

But her protests were useless.

Lily was immovable.

Under the stunned gazes of the onlookers, Evelyn was hauled out.

Late at night, Arabella luxuriated in her rose-petal bath, a homemade candle flickering beside her. The warm water soothed her tired muscles, and she sighed in contentment.

A man or a bath?

Easy choice.

Her phone rang, shattering the peaceful silence. It was her assistant, Jason.

"Jason," she said, putting the call on speaker as she lazily stirred the petals. "If it's too much, leave it for tomorrow. Get some rest."

"Ms. Arabella," Jason hesitated. "There's something you should know. But promise me you'll stay calm."

She snorted. "Jason, I've seen everything. Spit it out."

He took a deep breath. "I just saw Alexander with Isabella Abernathy. They checked into a hotel together."

Arabella sat bolt upright, water sloshing.

"What did you just say?"

"Alexander and Isabella," Jason repeated. "He handled the check-in himself. I couldn’t have mistaken it."

Her breath hitched.

Then—

"THAT BASTARD!"

Her furious roar shook the bathroom.

"WHERE'S MY GUN? I'LL MAKE HIM PAY FOR THIS!"
###Chapter 210

Isabella Sinclair stepped out of the shower, her damp hair cascading down her back as she wrapped herself in a cashmere coat.

She grabbed her keys and stormed out of the hotel, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor.

Something compelled her to do the unexpected—she dialed her ex-husband, Alexander Kingsley.

Her Bugatti roared to life as she sped toward her destination.

Meanwhile, Alexander was miles away in WillowBrook City, overseeing the construction of a new luxury spa resort for the Sinclair Group.

Dressed in a hard hat alongside his assistant, Preston Walsh, he was reviewing blueprints under the harsh glow of a floodlight when his phone buzzed.

Annoyed, he pulled it out—only for his breath to catch.

Isabella's name flashed on the screen like a forbidden jewel.

His fingers trembled slightly as he fumbled to answer.

"Mr. Kingsley! It's Mrs. Sinclair!" Preston whispered excitedly.

"I can see that," Alexander muttered, his pulse racing.

But his cold-numbed fingers betrayed him—he accidentally ended the call.

"Sir! You just hung up on her!" Preston gasped.

Alexander cursed under his breath, panic rising.

Then, mercifully, she called back.

This time, he answered.

"Finally decided to pick up?" Isabella's voice was smooth but laced with venom.

"You called. Of course I answered." His tone was sincere, though strained.

"Spare me the act, Alexander. Three years of marriage taught me exactly who you are. This isn't the first time you've dismissed me."

His brow furrowed. "I've never hung up on you."

"Save it. I didn't call to rehash the past." Her voice turned icy. "I need you to clean up Nathaniel's mess."

"Nathaniel? What did he do?" Alexander's expression darkened.

"Upset me? He's practically haunting the cemetery now! This is about Seraphina!"

Isabella's voice crackled with fury. "He got her drunk, dragged her to my hotel, and Jason caught the whole thing!"

Alexander stiffened. "Nathaniel wouldn't—"

"Anyone who associates with you can't possibly have morals," she snapped.

"Isabella—"

"I'm heading there now. Pray that bastard still has a shred of decency left, or I'll make sure he never fathers another heir in Windhelm!"

Her rage was palpable. "I'm keeping this quiet for Seraphina's sake. Get here, take her home, and don't involve anyone else!"

Then she hung up, leaving him staring at the darkened screen.

A bitter memory surfaced—how she used to call him for no reason during their marriage.

He'd never minded. But he'd been distant.

Had he really hung up on her before?

"Something's wrong with Seraphina. I need to return to Elmsworth," Alexander said, already moving.

"Now?" Preston checked his watch. "It's a two-hour drive with the highway construction! We won't make it in time. Shouldn't we inform her mother?"

"Isabella's already handling it. But I need to be there."

Alexander's gaze sharpened. "There's a helicopter at the Sinclair Group's WillowBrook branch, isn't there?"

"Yes, but it's midnight. Where will we find a pilot?"

Alexander's lips thinned. "I'll fly it."

Back in Elmsworth, the clock neared midnight.

The screech of tires echoed as Isabella's Bugatti executed a perfect drift into the hotel parking lot.

Jason exhaled in relief.

Stepping out, Isabella radiated lethal energy, her damp hair still clinging to her neck.

"Which room?"

"Top floor. Presidential suite." Jason hesitated. "They just entered. No other guests are nearby."

"Good."

Minutes later, Isabella stormed down the hallway, her stilettos striking like gunshots.

Jason swiped the master key.

The door flew open with a crash.

"Nathaniel! Face me!" Her voice shook the walls.

Then he appeared—dripping wet, a towel barely clinging to his hips.

Jason's eyes widened in alarm.

"Isabella?" Nathaniel's smirk was infuriating. "If I'd known you were coming, I'd have dressed better."

His gaze raked over her. "Though I do look good like this, don't I?"

Isabella didn't answer.

She crossed the distance in three strides—

Slap!

Slap!

Slap!

Three brutal strikes echoed through the suite.

Nathaniel staggered, his face burning. "You—you actually hit me!"

"Do I need an appointment?" She flexed her stinging palm. "I warned you. Seraphina is my sister. There are countless women for you to toy with—why her? Because corrupting your best friend's sister excites you?"

"No! Let me explain—"

"You're vile."

The word cut deeper than any blow. Nathaniel's eyes reddened.

"What did you do to Seraphina?"

A cold voice sliced through the tension.

Alexander stood in the doorway, dust coating his clothes.

Isabella frowned. Had he been digging ditches?

"Alex! She hit me!" Nathaniel whined. "And called me vile!"

Alexander's gaze locked onto Isabella, still seething.

"I can't control her," he said quietly. "I never could."
###Chapter 211

Nathaniel's jaw dropped as he took in the breathtaking couple before him, a vision of perfection that seemed almost unreal.

At surface level, Sebastian's words sounded innocent enough. But combined with that smoldering gaze and deep, velvety tone, they dripped with the unmistakable ache of unreciprocated affection.

How utterly pathetic.

Love was messy enough when returned. Unrequited? That was downright humiliating.

Nathaniel cursed himself for leaving his phone downstairs. He'd give anything to capture Sebastian's lovesick expression right now - perfect blackmail material for later teasing.

"Besides, you really have no memory?"

Sebastian's striking features darkened, his eyes flashing with barely contained fury. "I warned you not to touch Arabella, yet you deliberately crossed the line. Three slaps too harsh? I'd say you got off easy. Next time I see you, I'll make sure you can't sit for a week."

"Us?"

An odd sensation twisted in Isabella's chest. Sebastian's sudden familiarity made her skin crawl.

This was the same man who'd once avoided her like the plague, terrified of being associated with her. When had he become so... comfortable?

"Mr. Kingsley, mind your phrasing. You're you, I'm me. Don't lump us together," Isabella snapped, pivoting sharply toward the bedroom. "Unless you want me to feel insulted."

Sebentian bit his lip hard enough to draw blood.

Nathaniel burst into laughter. "Ouch! Rejected much? Serves you right!"

His triumph was short-lived.

Sebastian's fist connected with Nathaniel's abs with brutal precision. The impact sent shockwaves through his body, momentarily stealing his breath.

Isabella stormed into the bedroom.

Her mind raced with horrific scenarios during those few short steps. Whatever waited behind that door would determine Nathaniel's fate tonight.

If her fears proved true, not even Sebastian could save him.

She threw open the door - then froze.

The scene before her was nothing like the chaos she'd imagined.

Arabella's delicate perfume lingered in the air. Soft lamplight illuminated her peaceful face as she slept, one hand clutching a worn teddy bear. The sight hit Isabella like a physical blow.

She approached silently, sinking to her knees beside the bed. Her fingers trembled as they brushed Arabella's warm cheek.

A lump formed in her throat. Hot tears threatened to spill.

This fearless woman who thrived in battlefields of all kinds found herself utterly defenseless against such innocence.

Sebastian entered just as a tear escaped. His chest constricted painfully.

Isabella heard his approach and hastily wiped her eyes.

Clearing his throat, Sebastian reached for her damp hair. "You'll catch cold like this. Let me dry it for you."

"I don't need—"

She stood abruptly, putting distance between them.

Sebastian's heart churned with confusion. Since when had he become this person? This version of himself that even he didn't recognize?

"Nathaniel didn't harm Arabella. He may be reckless, but he knows she's under my protection."

"Men's words mean nothing. Neither do their actions," Isabella countered icily.

Knowing argument was futile, Sebastian turned toward the bathroom.

He returned moments later with a towel. "At least dry your hair before you—"

"I said I don't—"

Before she could finish, Sebastian draped the towel over her head and began gently rubbing her hair.

Isabella went rigid. Her pulse fluttered wildly.

This was Sebastian Kingsley? The same man who couldn't be bothered to pour her a glass of water?

Why now?

Fear prickled down her spine.

"Stop!" Her protest stirred Arabella slightly.

The girl murmured in her sleep but didn't wake.

"Keep shouting if you don't mind waking her," Sebastian murmured, a smirk playing on his lips as he continued his ministrations.

Isabella huffed. "At least be gentle. I'm losing enough hair as it is."

"My apologies. First time doing this," Sebastian admitted softly, his fingers massaging her scalp through the towel. "I'll improve with practice."

A shiver ran down Isabella's spine. "This is your one free pass because of Arabella. Next time, I'm taking a limb."

Sebastian chuckled, his skilled fingers working magic until Isabella felt her muscles relax against her will.

Damn him. It felt too good.

When they emerged, Isabella's eyes were slightly red-rimmed.

Sebastian watched her intently, his gaze never wavering.

Nathaniel blinked between them, suddenly feeling like a third wheel. They looked... right together. Like they'd never been apart.

"Nathaniel, go home. Arabella stays here tonight," Sebastian declared. "I'll bring her back tomorrow."

"I should stay too. Keep an eye on Isabella," Nathaniel insisted.

Memories of that drunken kiss with Arabella haunted him. While a kiss couldn't get anyone pregnant, he still felt guilty for taking advantage of his friend's sister.

"Absolutely not!" The ex-couple spoke in perfect unison.

"Ms. Sinclair!" Jason rushed in, phone in hand. "Security reports a helicopter just landed on our roof. No identification."

Sebastian didn't hesitate. "Mine."

"Mr. Kingsley was in Seattle on business yesterday," Gordon eagerly interjected, embellishing for his boss. "But he flew back immediately upon hearing from you, Ms. Sinclair! He's never moved so fast for any woman before."

Gordon believed his boss's problem was simply an inability to express himself. If only Sebastian had half of Nathaniel's shameless persistence.

Sebastian's ears burned. "Gordon. Silence."

"Shall I sing your praises too, Mr. Gordon?" Isabella's lips curled in cold amusement. "So when a good man errs, it's his true nature showing, but when a bad man does right, we throw a parade?"

Nathaniel snickered behind his hand.

Sebastian had no rebuttal.

"Arabella is his sister. Rushing back is basic decency, not something to boast about."

Isabella had no patience for this ridiculous duo. She headed for the door.

Jason shot Sebastian a disdainful look before following her out.

"Show-off," Gordon muttered under his breath.

"At least he knows when to speak," Sebastian sighed, shaking his head. "Gordon, you're excellent in every way except your inability to filter."

"But I just wanted Mrs. Kingsley to know how hard you've worked!" Gordon's shoulders slumped. "She's always known my struggles."

The words struck Sebastian like a physical blow. Memories of Isabella's endless patience and affection washed over him. She had indeed always understood him.

So why had he been so blind when she loved him so completely?

The weight of their tangled emotions pressed down on him - love and hate, debts that could never be repaid.
###Chapter 212

Evadne had just resolved Mari's problems and returned to the mansion with Jason.

The entire ride back, she couldn't stop replaying the moment Thaddeus had gently wiped her hair. Her chest tightened, and her throat went dry.

"I'm sorry, this is my first time doing this... I don't have much experience."

Liar.

He had been involved with Acacia for years. Even if they hadn't gone all the way, he must have done plenty. And now he had the nerve to act innocent in front of her?

The moment she stepped inside, Evadne kicked off her heels. Instead of heading straight to bed, she slumped onto the couch, her expression dark.

Jason handed her a warm glass of milk, concern etched on his face. "Miss Evadne, it's late. Drink this and get some rest."

"How did Mari and Jareth cross paths tonight?" Evadne's mind raced. "Mari is always under the Abernathy family's watch. What happened?"

She couldn't sleep, her thoughts consumed by the vulnerable girl.

"I asked Jareth. He claims he doesn’t know why Mari was at his club. Said she was frantically searching for something—that she might’ve been in danger if he hadn’t found her."

Evadne's brow furrowed. "Searching for what?"

"A teddy bear. The one you gave her."

Her breath hitched, fingers curling into fists. "The teddy bear I gave Mari was thrown into Sapphire Nights Club?"

Jason, ever the skilled lawyer, had extracted the necessary details. "I pressed him about anything unusual at the club. He denied it—but then mentioned his sister, Edith."

"Ah."

Evadne's eyes narrowed. She didn’t need to see it firsthand to piece it together. "Glynnis. Still up to your old tricks, aren’t you? Anyone who dares hurt Mari will pay."

Jareth, chased home by Thaddeus, stumbled through his front door in the early hours of dawn.

He collapsed onto his bed, eyes shut, but the memory of Mari’s lips against his in the dim light refused to fade.

Sweet. Soft. Intoxicating.

A sudden heat surged through him, and he groaned, throwing an arm over his face.

"Damn it. I’m a damn animal."

He squeezed his eyes shut, willing sleep to take him, but the throbbing ache below forced him out of bed. A twenty-minute ice-cold shower later, he finally managed to calm down.

By the time the sun rose, exhaustion dragged him under.

He didn’t wake until well past noon.

Dressed and ready, he stepped out of his room—only to be met by Edith’s furious glare.

"Jareth, you’ve gone too far!"

"Too far?" He arched a brow. "Because I told you to stay away from Sapphire Nights? Because I warned you about Glynnis?"

He reached out to ruffle her hair, sighing. "Edith, when did you become so naïve? Can’t you tell who’s good for you?"

She slapped his hand away, disgust twisting her features. "Don’t touch me with the same hands that touched Mari. It’s disgusting!"

Jareth froze, pupils contracting. "What did you just say?"

Humiliated from being dragged away in public, Edith unleashed her fury. "I hate her! You’re mine—only mine! Who does she think she is, trying to take you from me?"

His brows knitted together. "Edith, what the hell are you talking about?"

"You turned the entire club upside down for her! For a stupid, broken toy!"

Her voice cracked, her stomping echoing through the hall. Servants passed by, eyes averted, not daring to linger.

"I’m your sister! When have you ever cared about me like this? You just throw money at me! But for that idiot, you’d move heaven and earth! Have you lost your mind?!"

"Mari is not an idiot." His voice turned dangerously quiet. "And I won’t let you call her that again."

Edith paled, his icy stare sending chills down her spine.

"When we were kids, after Dad died and Mom was drowning in work, who took care of you? Who fed you? Carried you on his back? Changed your diapers?" His jaw clenched. "You say I don’t care? That I’m not good to you? In twenty years, nothing has cut deeper."

"Jareth—" Her voice trembled.

"I still care. But we’ve grown up. The way I show it has changed—you just refuse to see it." His gaze darkened. "What I don’t understand is why you hate Mari so much. What has she ever done to you?"

"I just don’t like her! She doesn’t deserve you!"

His expression hardened. "You have no right to look down on her. In status, she’s a rising star at Abernathy Group—higher than either of us. Even if she had nothing, it wouldn’t matter. The woman I want? No one stops me."

With that, he turned and walked away, leaving Edith seething in humiliated silence.

A full week had passed since Ada Ang terminated her contract with K World Hotel.

Jason had spent every day monitoring the wedding planning team—but found nothing.

Frustrated, he rubbed his temples. "Miss Evadne, we’ve hit a wall. Are we looking in the wrong direction?"

Evadne, engrossed in a video game, didn’t glance up. "Has anyone reached out to Caroline Porter?"

"No. Radio silence."

"Hm. Still waters run deep." She smirked, executing a brutal in-game kill that made Jason wince. "Time to stir the pot. Gather the team. Conference room, now."

Thirty minutes later, the eight employees previously assigned to Ada’s wedding sat waiting.

Evadne strolled in ten minutes late, cheerful as ever.

"Apologies for the delay, everyone. Urgent matters."

She took her seat at the head of the table, scanning their faces with a confident smile. "I’ve drafted a new wedding plan. We’re going after Ada again—I want her back."

Gasps filled the room. "Really? That’s amazing!"

Her sharp eyes caught the subtle shift in Kevin’s expression.

Right on cue, he raised his hand.

"President Ashbourne, hasn’t Ada already signed with Abernathy Group? How can we possibly win her back now?"

Her fingers tapped the table, lips curving. "Oh? Ada’s with Abernathy? Funny. Big news like that, and you know before I do?"
###Chapter 213

A question as sharp as a dagger's edge pinned all eyes in the room on Nathan.

Nathan, under Isabella's smiling yet penetrating gaze, felt an icy shiver down his spine. Still, he maintained his composure. "It's common knowledge in our circles now. The Vanderbilt Group had prior dealings with us, and Evelyn got caught in the middle, torn between you and Mr. Alexander. But your undeniable expertise secured you the wedding contract. Now that we've faltered, and with Evelyn's wedding approaching, isn't it natural she'd turn to the Vanderbilts?"

His words were meticulously crafted, leaving no room for rebuttal.

Isabella's eyes crinkled with amusement as she reclined in her chair. "Your reasoning is sound, but you've missed one crucial detail. To my knowledge, the Vanderbilts and Evelyn haven't signed any formal agreement yet."

Gasps filled the room. "What? It's been a week without a contract?"

Nathan's expression remained neutral, but tension flickered across his face.

"If they'd signed, wouldn't the Vanderbilts be shouting it from the rooftops? Their silence suggests negotiations are still ongoing. Which means we still have a shot."

Isabella spun her chair lazily. "I'm stubborn by nature—I don't back down until the final bell. So, I've drafted a new proposal to present to Evelyn in the coming days. Let's see if we can catch the Vanderbilts off guard."

The room erupted in applause. "That's our CEO! Relentless!"

Nathan forced a smile and joined the clapping.

"But, Ms. Sinclair," he interjected, "we were the ones who breached contract first. Evelyn likely holds a grudge. Won't you be wasting your time trying to negotiate again?"

"True. Some things can't be forced." Isabella's lips, painted a bold crimson, curved into an unapologetic smirk. "But just because life disappoints doesn't mean we stop trying. Even if it's a long shot, I'm taking it."

After the meeting, only Isabella and Daniel remained in the expansive conference room.

Accepting the coffee Daniel handed her, Isabella stood before the floor-to-ceiling window, surveying Elmsworth's skyline. She took a leisurely sip. "Daniel, when I mentioned the new proposal earlier—was I lying?"

His eyes sparkled with intrigue. "Were you?"

"I was. And I caught something."

Daniel leaned in. "Who?"

"I have suspicions, but no proof yet." Her gaze darkened. "Follow Nathan after work tonight. Report back on who he meets and any unusual activity."

The next morning, Evelyn awoke in her own bed, personally escorted home by Alexander the previous night.

His intimidating presence had silenced Elspeth, who dared not protest in front of Frederic. As for Glynnis, she stayed quiet—she was the guilty party, after all. Elspeth might cover for her, but Frederic wouldn't hesitate to reprimand her if he knew.

That evening, Evelyn hugged her reclaimed teddy bear, replaying the previous night's events. Her pulse quickened; her cheeks warmed.

Truthfully, she'd blacked out and couldn't recall how she'd gotten home. Only fragments remained: the moment the lights died, the weight of a kiss on her lips, teasing, intoxicating. And those smoldering eyes, piercing through her, as if reading her soul.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, rose, and settled at her desk.

Sketchbook open, pencil in hand, she closed her eyes briefly before letting her hand glide across the paper. Ten minutes later, a strikingly handsome face emerged—sharp features, devilish charm, eyes brimming with mischief.

Her fingertip traced the drawing's jawline. "Sebastian, you're dangerously beautiful."

Unbeknownst to her, the real Sebastian was already speeding toward Windermere Estate in his crimson Ferrari.

"Who did you say is here?" Elspeth, strolling the gardens with Frederic, froze at the butler's announcement. "Madam, it's the eldest son of the Fairhaven family."

"At this hour?" Frederic checked his watch, frowning. "Alexander isn't home. He knows that. And it's nearly dinnertime. Why come now?"

Elspeth squeezed his arm. "Frederic, Mr. Fairhaven rarely visits. Don't overthink it. Perhaps he's here to see Glynnis."

"Are you suggesting Sebastian and Glynnis...?" Frederic's brows shot up.

"You're too busy to notice our daughter's feelings." Elspeth tapped his chest playfully. "Glynnis has adored Mr. Fairhaven for years."

Frederic gaped. "Glynnis likes Sebastian? How did I miss this?"

"Girls don't announce these things, Frederic." Elspeth feigned embarrassment. "But this isn't trivial. Glynnis's marriage impacts the Vanderbilt Group's future."

Frederic sobered instantly. "Glynnis is my heir. Her spouse must be exceptional—not just in Elmsworth, but nationally."

"The Fairhavens are among Elmsworth's elite. Sebastian is Barry Fairhaven's sole heir. With Barry aging and no other successors, Sebastian inherits everything." Elspeth's eyes gleamed. "Plus, he's Alexander's closest friend. A marriage would bind our families twice over. Ideal, no?"

Frederic's expression softened. True, Sebastian's reputation wasn't spotless, but what young heir, raised in luxury, didn't sow wild oats? Frederic himself had been reckless in youth. Marriage—and the weight of the Vanderbilt empire—would tame him.

Sebastian lounged in the mansion's parlor, sipping coffee he'd poured himself. Having grown up here alongside Alexander, he moved with the ease of family.

"Sebastian, what brings you by?" Frederic and Elspeth entered. Normally, Frederic wouldn't greet guests personally, but Elspeth's scheming had piqued his interest.

"An urgent matter. I hope I'm not intruding."

"We're about to dine. Join us?" Elspeth offered warmly.

"No need." Sebastian set his cup down. "Is Glynnis home? I'd like a word."

The couple exchanged glances.

When Glynnis heard Sebastian had asked for her, her heart nearly burst. Remembering her mother's advice—"Men chase what retreats"—she'd resisted rushing out. Now, he'd come to her!

Flushed, she entered the tea room. "Mr. Fairhaven, you wanted to see me?"

Sebastian took a slow sip. "About last night at Sapphire Nights—anything to say?"

"Last night? What happened?" Her chest tightened.

"How did Evelyn's teddy bear—a girl who barely leaves home—end up discarded at a nightclub?" His cup clinked sharply against the saucer. "Glynnis, jokes have limits. You crossed one."

Her face paled. "You misunderstand—" Tears welled up.

"Evelyn didn't cry after your little stunt. Why are you?" His glare could freeze fire. "Two things. First, if you bully Evelyn again, remember who's watching her now. Second, stay away from my sister. She's innocent. Don't corrupt her."

He stood and strode out without a backward glance.

Glynnis collapsed onto the couch, staring blankly at the door, her spirit shattered.
###Chapter 214

His movements appeared effortless, yet every step was calculated.

He longed to catch another glimpse of that fragile girl with the downcast eyes and sorrowful demeanor.

Good intentions had never been his forte.

But something about that pitiful child always managed to pierce through his hardened exterior.

"Mr. Kingsley? What are you doing here?" Alva's voice startled him as she approached, brows raised in surprise.

"Ah—" Alexander fumbled for words before lowering his voice. "Alva, where is Isabella staying?"

The older woman blinked, baffled.

No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't reconcile the man before her with the reckless playboy she knew.

"What do you want with her? Mr. Kingsley, she's still a child. She doesn’t interact with strangers often. Don’t frighten her."

Alexander smirked. "Alva, you’ve known me since I was in diapers. Do you really think I’d harm her?"

"You’ve always been loyal to our young master," Alva conceded, giving an approving nod.

"But when it comes to women?" She flipped her thumb downward with a pointed look.

Alexander groaned, pinching the bridge of his nose.

After much persuasion—and a desperate attempt to salvage his tarnished reputation—Alva reluctantly led him to Isabella’s room.

"Wait here. Say what you need to say quickly. It’s best if no one sees you." Alva crossed her arms, her tone stern.

Alexander chuckled. "Alva, you’re not playing matchmaker, and I’m not here to seduce anyone. Relax."

With that, he pushed the door open and stepped inside, shutting it firmly behind him.

Alva gaped, then huffed. "That brat! How dare he mock me?"

The moment Alexander entered, his breath caught.

Compared to his sister’s lavish chambers, Isabella’s room was startlingly bare—devoid of any personal touches, cold and unwelcoming.

A faint rustling sound drew his attention toward the bedroom. He moved silently, careful not to alert her.

The door was slightly ajar. He slipped inside.

There she was—hunched over a large desk, her delicate frame bent in concentration as she sketched.

His pulse quickened. He crept closer, peering over her shoulder.

Then his heart lurched violently.

She was drawing him.

Isabella set down her pencil, her doe-like eyes crinkling as she admired her work.

"When were you planning to give that to me?"

She shrieked, scrambling to cover the drawing—but he was faster.

With a swift tug, he snatched it from her grasp.

"Give it back!" Her cheeks flamed as she stretched on her toes, fingers brushing his wrist.

He towered over her, an immovable obstacle. Frustrated, she grabbed his tie with one hand and wrapped the other around his waist, trying to reclaim her artwork.

"Let go—I can’t breathe—"

Choking, Alexander had no choice but to bend, lifting her by the waist and depositing her onto the desk.

"That’s mine!" Her eyes blazed with defiance.

"It’s my likeness. By law, you’ve violated my portrait rights."

His gaze softened as he studied her. "As compensation, will you give this to me, Isabella?"

Her face burned. She yanked his tie hard.

Alexander stumbled forward, his body pressing flush against hers.

Their lips were a breath apart.

The memory of last night’s stolen kiss surged through him, igniting a fire in his veins.

"T-Ticklish—"

She turned her face away, his warm breath laced with tobacco making her skin prickle.

Her heart hammered wildly.

Alexander fought to steady himself. Her body was impossibly soft—softer than silk, more inviting than his most luxurious sheets.

Reluctantly, he forced himself upright, his breathing ragged.

Isabella curled into herself, small and vulnerable.

She buried her face in her knees, extending a hand. "Give it back."

"I saved your teddy bear last night. The least you could do is gift me this drawing."

He braced an arm on the desk, leaning closer. "I really like it. Will you let me keep it?"

"I—I already prepared something else for you." Her voice was barely a whisper, toes curling.

"Where is it?" His eyes gleamed.

Ten minutes later, Alexander returned to his car, triumphant.

In one hand, he held a cake box. In the other, the rolled-up portrait.

A satisfied smirk played on his lips.

He had coveted this ever since seeing the painting she gifted her grandfather at his birthday celebration—a masterpiece crafted just for him.

And now, it was his.

The joy was indescribable.

Carefully storing the drawing, he eagerly opened the cake box.

Inside sat a lopsided, slightly misshapen blueberry mousse cake.

He dipped a finger into the frosting, tasting it.

His nose wrinkled.

Too sweet.

Late that night, Evadne lounged in her study, a face mask clinging to her skin as she mindlessly clicked through a game.

Exhaustion weighed on her, but she refused to sleep—not until Jason returned with news of Kevin.

Her inbox overflowed with tournament invitations, all of which she ignored. Gaming was her escape, not a career.

A notification popped up.

Avery has logged in.

[Care for a match, Rose?]

[Sure, Cifero. Send the invite.]

Avery’s smooth voice filled the room through her headset.

"Good evening, Miss Cifero."

"Good evening, Mr. Rose."

"Resilient as ever, I see. Ada’s scandal doesn’t seem to faze you."

"Special training," she quipped.

"Oh?"

"Nothing outside my integrity can shake me."

Avery chuckled. After a pause, he asked, "Need help with Ada?"

"No. This is between me and Abernathy. I won’t drag Chambers into it."

"I’m offering as a friend, not as Chambers’ heir."

Evadne arched a brow. "Don’t trust me to handle it alone?"

"No." His sigh was fond. "I just want to free up your schedule. You’ve been offline for days."

Her fingers stilled.

Had he been waiting for her?

Pathetic.

A knock interrupted them.

"Miss Evadne! I’m back!"

Relief flooded her. "Mr. Avery, urgent matter. Goodnight!"

She disconnected before he could respond.

On his screen, Avery stared at the empty chat.

"Goodnight, Evadne," he murmured.

Then his expression darkened as he pulled up files—detailed dossiers on Jason and his brothers.
###Chapter 215

The crisp autumn air clung to Jason as he hurried back to Evadne's residence, his breath ragged and his forehead glistening with sweat.

Instead of demanding answers right away, Evadne calmly poured him a steaming cup of coffee from the carafe on the table and extended it toward him.

"Take a moment. Warm up."

Jason accepted the cup, their fingers brushing briefly. The contact sent an unexpected jolt through him, his pulse quickening. "Sit down," she murmured.

Evadne settled onto the couch first, her legs tucked beneath her silk nightgown, the delicate pink slippers dangling playfully from her toes.

Jason flushed, gripping the cup tighter to steady himself. "Miss Evadne, your instincts were right. Kevin does know Caroline. And they're... close."

A slow, knowing smile curved her lips. "Even Cleopatra needed her Marc Antony."

He handed over his phone, the screen displaying damning evidence.

She scrolled through the photos—Kevin and Caroline in a dimly lit café, his fingers tracing her cheek, her hands cradling his. The intimacy between them was undeniable.

"We have enough to confront him now!" Jason's voice vibrated with excitement.

"Not even close." She set the phone down, her tone icy.

"What? I tracked their hotel stays for the past two months—twice a week, like clockwork. Before that? Nothing. It's obvious he's the mole!"

"Obvious doesn't mean proven." Evadne leaned back, eyes fluttering shut. "If they claim they're just lovers, what then? We need irrefutable proof of corporate espionage."

Understanding dawned on Jason. She didn’t just want to expose Kevin—she wanted to bury him.

"For now, stop tailing Kevin. Focus on Caroline and Glynnis. Dig deeper into Caroline’s past. There’s always a skeleton somewhere."

"Yes, Miss Evadne."

A soft sigh escaped her lips.

He glanced over—she had fallen asleep. Her lashes cast delicate shadows, her lips slightly parted. Exhaustion had finally claimed her.

A pang of protectiveness shot through him. He knelt beside the couch, fighting the urge to lift her into his arms. Instead, he draped a blanket over her with painstaking care.

He knew his place.

Only family—or the man who owned her heart—had that privilege.

Thaddeus sat alone in his study, swirling red wine in an ornate crystal glass.

A gift from Evadne.

Had she imagined them sharing countless evenings like this when she gave it to him?

The thought soured the wine on his tongue.

A sharp knock interrupted his brooding. Gordon strode in, clutching a thick file.

"Sir, I’ve compiled everything on Caroline Porter. Down to her great-grandfather’s burial plot. Nothing was overlooked."

"Good. Send it to Cassius."

Gordon blinked. "To—President Ashbourne?"

Thaddeus’s glare was answer enough.

"Right. Mrs. Abernathy."

"Anonymously."

Gordon nearly choked. "Why?"

Thaddeus exhaled. "If she sees it’s from Abernathy, she’ll delete it unread."

Gordon bit back a groan. How had they fallen this low?

A sudden vibration cut through the tension. Jareth’s face flashed on the screen.

Thaddeus answered, deadpan. "What now?"

Jareth’s pallid face filled the frame, hospital sheets stark white behind him. "Thad. I’m dying."

"My condolences."

"It’s Mari’s fault!" Jareth groaned, clutching his stomach. "She fed me a blueberry pie. Tasted like battery acid, but I ate the whole damn thing to be polite. Now I’m pumping my guts out in the ER. The doctor said it was rotten!"

Gordon turned away, shoulders shaking with silent laughter.

Thaddeus pressed his lips together. "If it tasted off, why finish it?"

"Because she made it for me!" Jareth wailed before another cramp doubled him over.

Even the toughest man couldn’t withstand food poisoning’s wrath.
###Chapter 216

The team's morale had been restored after their last meeting. Where there was once despair, now burned a renewed fire of determination.

Isabella Sinclair wasn't just a leader—she was a force of nature. Her presence alone could turn skeptics into devoted followers, her brilliance impossible to ignore.

Today, she stood at the head of the conference table, radiating confidence as always.

"I've secured a meeting with Ms. Ada tonight," she announced. "No matter the outcome, this is already a victory."

The room erupted in cheers.

Only Nathan Prescott, seated at the far end, wore a smile that didn't reach his eyes.

"Even though we breached contract first, I know Ms. Ada values flexibility. My new proposal surpasses the Abernathy Group's. Once she sees it, she'll forget their offer ever existed."

"President Sinclair! Let us see it too!"

"I'd love to share it now," Isabella said, her tone measured, "but after last time, I can't take risks. It's not about trust—we're being watched. As manager of The Regal Palace, I won't make the same mistake twice."

The team nodded in understanding, their faith in her unshaken. They were ready to fight alongside her.

As dusk fell, Isabella dined in the hotel restaurant while Daniel Carter organized her documents in the office.

Once finished, Daniel made a call and left.

The moment the door closed, Nathan burst in like a storm.

Security was lax that evening, and he slipped into Isabella's private area unnoticed.

He knew the cameras were everywhere, but time was running out.

If he didn't steal the proposal tonight—if Isabella succeeded in winning Ada back—his revenge for Victoria Sterling would be lost.

Blinded by what he believed was love, Nathan was willing to risk everything.

Even breaking the law.

Using his phone's flashlight, he rifled through drawers and cabinets, sweat beading on his forehead.

It had to be here.

Isabella hadn't left the hotel yet. Daniel hadn't taken anything when he exited.

Then—there. Buried beneath stacks of files, he found it.

"Finally!"

Nathan clutched the document, hands trembling. "Victoria," he whispered, voice thick with emotion. "This is for you."

Click.

The lights blazed on.

Security swarmed in, led by Daniel, surrounding Nathan before he could react.

Caught red-handed, he stood frozen, the papers still in his grip.

He'd known this was a possibility—but not so soon.

Then the guards parted.

Isabella strode in, clad in a sleek black suit, her red-soled heels clicking against the floor. She moved like a detective in a noir film, all sharp edges and calculated grace.

"Nathan," she said coolly, "commercial theft is still theft. With what you're holding, I could send you to prison and ruin your life."

Daniel's voice cut through the tension. "Whoever causes substantial losses to trade secret holders faces up to three years imprisonment. Severe cases? Ten years."

Nathan staggered back, face draining of color.

"With all this evidence," Isabella tilted her head, "what do you have to say for yourself?"

Daniel's jaw clenched, fury simmering beneath his calm.

"Nothing." Nathan lifted his chin, defiance burning in his eyes. "I stole it. I leaked it to the press. I'll take whatever comes."

Isabella dismissed the guards, leaving only Daniel with them.

"Since we're here," she said, plucking a chocolate from a tray, "I might as well tell you the truth." She took a deliberate bite. "There was never a new proposal. No meeting with Ada."

Nathan's breath hitched. "What?"

"See for yourself."

He frantically flipped through the document—only to find blank pages after the first sheet.

A trap.

Isabella had played him perfectly.

"How did you know it was me?"

"The Regal Palace is impenetrable to outsiders," she mused. "Only an insider could betray us."

She studied him over another chocolate. "After the leak, I suspected a mole. I watched everyone—but you were careful. No contact with Victoria. If I hadn't set this up, you'd still be hiding."

"You knew about Victoria?" Panic flashed across his face.

Daniel scoffed. "Did you forget who President Sinclair is?"

Nathan's shoulders slumped.

Isabella Sinclair, heir to the Sinclair fortune. Of course Victoria couldn't hide from her.

The realization was crushing.

"Nathan," Isabella sighed, "you've worked here ten years. Diligent. Talented. I was going to promote you to Director of Planning."

His eyes widened.

"And for what? Love?" She shook her head. "Was it worth throwing away your future?"

"Absolutely!" Nathan's voice cracked with desperation. "I'd do anything for her!"

Suddenly, he lunged forward, face twisted in rage.

Isabella didn't flinch.

Daniel moved instantly, shielding her.

"Stop pretending to care!" Nathan spat. "This is revenge for Victoria! Her father's in jail because of you! You ruined her life! People like you—you deserve worse than losing a deal. You deserve to die!"
###Chapter 217

Keyn's rage burned like wildfire as he hurled accusations at Evadne, as though she had personally destroyed his entire world.

Jason's handsome face flushed crimson at the vicious words, but Evadne remained unfazed. A playful smirk curled her red lips. "Well, this is getting interesting."

"What did you just say?" Kevin demanded, his face paling.

"I said Caroline is fascinating," Evadne replied, reaching for another piece of chocolate. Jason couldn't help but chuckle at her sweet tooth.

"You've known her for two months, yet you're willing to throw away your career—your life—for her. Impressive. But let me make one thing clear, Kevin." Her icy gaze pinned him in place. "You have no right to judge me. And if you dare sabotage the Ashbourne family's business, don't expect mercy. Patience isn't my virtue."

Kevin recoiled, the fear he'd suppressed surging back. Evadne's presence was suffocating.

"I'll tell you the truth, Kevin. Caroline never loved you. She used you because you were an easy target."

"Shut up!" Kevin roared, his voice raw like a wounded beast. "You don't know her! You have no right—"

Ignoring him, Evadne signaled Jason to turn on the TV. The screen lit up with explicit photos—Caroline entangled with none other than the President of Pioneer Post, Smith.

Jason stiffened. "Where did you get these?" he whispered.

"Later," Evadne murmured, watching Kevin collapse to his knees, sobbing uncontrollably.

"Why would she do this to me?" His tears fell like a storm.

"You were a pawn, Kevin. And behind Caroline? Someone else is pulling the strings." Her voice was merciless.

Kevin's regret was palpable—not for ruining his future, but for falling for a woman who never cared.

"Ms. Ashbourne... I'll tell you everything."

After a brutal interrogation, Kevin confessed how Caroline manipulated him into stealing trade secrets. Jason recorded every word, ready to charge him with corporate theft.

Now that they'd caught the traitor, it was time to hunt the puppeteer.

Evadne sighed, glancing at her untouched desk. "He kept things orderly. Pity he chose betrayal."

"Miss Evadne, you still haven't told me—"

"Thaddeus sent the photos."

Jason's eyes widened. "Thaddeus? But he's our competitor. Why help us?"

"Maybe he didn't want Elspeth and Glynnis to win. Or perhaps he thought I'd return the favor."

Her mind drifted to Thaddeus—the man who'd gently brushed her hair that night. A cold laugh escaped her. "I'd sooner trust a ghost. Sending an anonymous email? How predictable."

"So, what's next for Caroline?" Jason asked.

"Even with Kevin's confession, we lack concrete evidence to charge her."

"Who said anything about charging her?" Evadne's gaze turned glacial as she studied the scandalous images. "Send these to Mrs. Smith. I hear she's quite... athletic."

Jason smirked. "Free self-defense training, then?"

Evadne's hand slipped into his suit pocket, fishing for more chocolates. "I've already dealt with her father. No need to get my hands dirtier."

Jason caught her wrist through the fabric, his voice warm but firm. "Miss Evadne, less sugar. Your teeth won't thank you."

That night, Thaddeus lingered in his office, waiting for Gordon's update.

"Mr. Thaddeus! Mrs. Abernathy caught the mole and handed him to the police!"

"Good." His tension eased slightly.

"Do you think she used the intel you sent?"

"Doesn't matter." Thaddeus thought of her—ambitious, cunning. "She didn't need my help. I just sped things up."

He'd underestimated her. In their marriage, he'd dismissed her as ordinary—just a woman who cooked.

How blind he'd been.

The intercom buzzed. "Mr. Thaddeus, President Ashbourne's secretary is here. No appointment."

Gordon scowled. "Send him away—"

"Let him in."

Minutes later, Jason strode in, expression frosty.

"Mr. Thaddeus. A gift from Miss Evadne." He placed a pristine white box on the desk.

Thaddeus didn't glance up. "What is it?"

"A bomb."

Gordon bristled. "You think you're funny?"

Jason smirked. "If it were a bomb, would security have let me through?"

Thaddeus opened the box. Inside sat a lopsided dog-shaped cake—adorably ugly.

A faint smile tugged his lips. "Did she make this?"

Jason scoffed. "Wishful thinking. She bought it. You're not worth her time in the kitchen."

Gordon lunged forward, fists clenched. "You—!"

"Enough." Thaddeus's voice cut like steel. "Why send this?"

"Miss Evadne knows you sent those 'anonymous' files. Consider this a thank you." Jason's tone dripped sarcasm. "And a reminder—she doesn't need your help. Or your pity."

With that, he left.

Gordon fumed. "Insolent—!"

Thaddeus stared at the cake, jaw tight.

She'd seen through him. Again.
###Chapter 218

The penthouse suite of The Regal Palace was bathed in dim golden light.

Caroline Sinclair moaned dramatically as she rode President Kingsley with practiced enthusiasm. "Oh god, you're incredible...how do you do this to me?"

"Say it again, sweetheart," Kingsley growled, gripping her hips.

Caroline forced another breathy moan, counting the seconds until this disgusting old man would finish. Sacrificing her dignity was just another step toward becoming News Director.

Just as Kingsley's grip tightened—

BANG!

The door exploded inward.

Caroline shrieked and scrambled off him, yanking the sheets over herself. Kingsley fumbled for his boxers, face draining of color when he saw who stood in the doorway.

His wife.

"Is this the little whore you've been fucking behind my back?"

Mrs. Kingsley loomed over them—taller than most men, muscles flexing as she rolled up her sleeves. Caroline trembled.

"I expected a seductress," Mrs. Kingsley sneered. "But you? Pathetic. You look like a drowned rat. My husband has terrible taste."

Before Caroline could react, Mrs. Kingsley seized her hair and yanked—

SLAP! SLAP! SLAP!

Blood sprayed from Caroline's split lip.

"President Kingsley! Help me!" she wailed.

He didn't move. He was too busy kneeling like a dog.

Mrs. Kingsley's assistant marched in with two bodyguards, live-streaming the entire scene on his phone. "Come see! Homewrecker caught red-handed!"

Caroline's stomach dropped.

"Smith," Mrs. Kingsley snarled. "Remember who paid your debts when you were bankrupt. Who funded your first company. Without me, you'd be nothing."

"I'm nothing," Kingsley whimpered.

Caroline sobbed into her hands. How had they been caught? Two years of secrecy—ruined in one night.

The beating that followed was brutal. Kingsley was dragged out half-naked. Caroline curled into a ball, missing a tooth, face swollen.

"You're wondering how I found out." Mrs. Kingsley leaned down, smirking. "Think hard, sweetheart. Who did you piss off recently?"

The door slammed shut.

Silence.

Caroline's mind raced. Then—

Evadne.

Her phone buzzed. An email with an audio attachment.

Kevin's voice filled the room, detailing every secret she'd whispered to him—how she'd manipulated him into stealing the K World Hotel's bidding documents.

Exposed.

Her phone clattered to the floor.

Caroline collapsed, world spinning.

Meanwhile, Glynnis Vanderbilt soaked in her marble tub, scowling at her reflection.

That idiot Mari. Why did Evadne protect her? And now Jareth was involved?

She grabbed her lipstick and scrawled MARI across the mirror, then viciously crossed it out. "After I'm General Manager, you're next."

Her phone rang.

Edith's name flashed. Glynnis forced a sweet tone. "Edith, darling! What's—"

"Evadne found the mole. He's in police custody."

Glynnis's grip tightened. "What about Caroline?"

"Have you seen the news? Mrs. Kingsley live-streamed catching Caroline in bed with her husband. It's everywhere."

Glynnis's blood ran cold.

"Delete all messages with Caroline. Now."

Another call beeped—her secretary. "Miss Sinclair was in a car accident. Critical condition."

Glynnis nearly laughed. "Perfect."

"Perfect?!"

"An accident means she can't talk. Evadne can't trace this back to us." Glynnis smirked. "Let her rot in that hospital."

Evadne selected a bottle of Bordeaux from her wine cellar.

Jason steadied the ladder. "Caroline's accident was...convenient."

"Karma," Evadne said coolly.

Mrs. Kingsley's revenge had been brutal. Evadne understood—she'd been betrayed too.

"Glynnis must be relieved," Jason mused.

"Let her enjoy it while she can."

Her phone rang.

Jareth.

Evadne groaned. "The idiot strikes again."
###Chapter 219

"Sebastian, let the Lafite breathe for a while." Isabella sighed, handing over her phone.

Sebastian's heart sank. He knew what that meant—she wanted him to leave.

"I know what you're thinking." Isabella's lips curved into a reassuring smile as she patted his shoulder. "Yes, Alexander and I had a disastrous marriage, and yes, I found him insufferable. But that doesn't mean I can avoid him forever."

Her gaze was steady, unreadable. "If I want to establish myself in Elmsworth, I can't cut him out completely. We'll just have to play it by ear."

"But, Miss Isabella—"

"What are you so afraid of?" She arched a brow. "That he'll devour me whole? If he dares lay a finger on me, Lucas wouldn't even need to lift a hand—Oliver could make Alexander vanish from Elmsworth without a trace."

That wasn't his concern.

Sebastian admired her fiercely. He'd risk his life for her without hesitation. What terrified him was the possibility of old flames reigniting. The thought of her willingly stepping back into that inferno made his chest tighten.

With a resigned sigh, he took the wine and left.

Isabella's phone buzzed insistently in her palm. Persistent. Predictable.

"Mr. Kingsley," she answered, her voice icy. "To what do I owe this unexpected call?"

"Thank you for the cake. It was... unexpectedly good."

Her breath hitched.

In the quiet of the night, Alexander's voice was smooth, magnetic, laced with that subtle lilt that had once made her heart race.

She used to call him just to hear him speak. Even when he was distant, his voice alone sent her spiraling into giddy excitement. Now? Nothing.

She had always been disciplined. Love was no exception.

"You're welcome," she replied coolly. "Consider it a lesson. Next time you feel the urge to meddle, remember the bulldog cake."

"I wasn't meddling." His tone sharpened. "Your situation isn't trivial."

She scoffed. "Oh, it's far from trivial. Slaughtering a pig requires a butcher's knife, doesn't it? I'm happy to help cut Glynnis down to size. If she becomes general manager of The Regal Palace, your stepmother will be busier than ever. And we both know you can't afford more instability at Kingsley Group."

Silence.

Tana had been kind to him. Genuine.

But Isabella? She was cunning. Unpredictable.

Yet he couldn't let her go.

How many steps did it take to go from arrogance to pathetic desperation?

"Isabella," he said finally, "do you honestly think I care about Elspeth and her daughter? They're nothing under my watch. If they could make waves, I'd have failed as CEO long ago."

Another pause. He wanted to say more but held back.

Her knuckles cracked as she clenched her fists. "Alexander, here's some advice from your ex-wife—stay out of my business. When I'm serious, even mosquitoes know to steer clear. If you get in my way, don't blame me for what happens next."

"Do whatever you want."

His voice was low, intimate, like the brush of night air against her skin. "I can't control everything. But as long as I'm at Kingsley Group, no one can touch you."

Her frown deepened. That... didn't sound right.

Silence stretched between them, thick and uneasy.

Then, abruptly, he cleared his throat. "I have nothing else to say. Goodnight."

"Wait—"

The line went dead.

Isabella stared at her phone. "What kind of nonsense was that? How much has he had to drink?"

On the other end, Alexander exhaled sharply. His palm was damp, his throat dry. His pulse hammered erratically.

He closed his eyes and forced himself to breathe.

Caroline was in a coma.

The doctors said she was vegetative. Unlikely to wake.

For Glynnis, it was a blessing in disguise.

If Caroline woke, her bribery scheme would be exposed.

But even with that problem "solved," Glynnis was drowning.

Ada had made her stance clear—without Alexander's interference, she wouldn't sign. Worse, Ada's team was already scouting other hotels.

Glynnis was desperate.

Edith, however, was calm. Sipping tea like she hadn't a care in the world.

"What are we going to do about Ada?" Glynnis demanded. "That woman demanded top-tier jewelry! Alexander's been chasing Alea for months, even flying overseas to beg her, but nothing!"

Edith's eyes gleamed.

"Exactly why Isabella won her over with just one brooch at the banquet."

Glynnis seethed. "If I had Alea's pieces, none of this would be happening!"

"But you do," Edith murmured.

Glynnis froze. "What?"

"Alea's a ghost. No one's seen her face. Few have seen her work. So..." Edith leaned in. "Why not give Ada a replica?"

"A fake?!" Glynnis gaped. "If we're caught—"

"Who would know? Even experts struggle to spot counterfeit paintings at auctions. Jewelry? Unless Alea herself shows up, no one can tell."

She smirked. "I studied in Aetheria with a jeweler—Alea's former apprentice. He can recreate one of her pieces for you. Give it to Ada privately. She'll be so thrilled, she'll sign anything."

Glynnis hesitated.

But time was running out.

Desperation won.

She'd roll the dice.
###Chapter 220

With Isabella's birthday drawing near, Evelyn spent her days working and her nights secluded in her room, meticulously crafting a handmade gift for her sister.

She was designing a ring.

18k gold. Natural aquamarine. Flawless diamonds.

For Evelyn, a master jewelry designer, the technical aspects were effortless. But this gift held deeper meaning—the aquamarine was rare, its size impressive, its clarity unmatched. A collector's piece, its worth comparable to legendary gemstones.

When it came to gifts for those she loved, Evelyn never held back. She poured her heart into every detail, refusing to rush or cut corners.

Just as she had once done for Nathaniel.

But that man had never appreciated her efforts.

Her phone buzzed with a video call. Olivia, her studio manager.

"What's so urgent at this hour?" Evelyn asked, carefully polishing the gemstone.

"Do you remember Tyler?" Olivia's voice was tense.

"Of course. My apprentice for three years before he started his own business. Talented, skilled. What about him?"

"Two days ago, someone approached him to replicate one of your designs. Can you believe it? If you don't make a comeback, fakes of your work will flood the market."

Evelyn chuckled, unfazed. "Why be angry? Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Those who can't afford my pieces settle for counterfeits to feed their vanity."

"Tyler couldn’t reach you, so he came to me. He refused the job—wouldn’t betray his mentor’s work or compromise his integrity."

Evelyn’s curiosity piqued. "Who’s trying to copy my designs? Whoever identified Tyler as my apprentice must have serious connections."

"Not sure how they met, but the girl’s from Elmsworth, Windhelm. Last name Fairhaven. Oh, and she’s the apprentice of the pianist Christian."

Evelyn’s eyes gleamed.

Now she knew.

If they were so eager to play with fire, she wouldn’t hold back.

"Olivia, tell Tyler to take Ms. Edith’s order," Evelyn said, lips curving into a smirk.

"What? Why?" Olivia sounded baffled.

"Not just take it—do it flawlessly. He can’t tarnish my reputation."

Five days later.

Nathaniel, fresh from a corporate meeting, received unexpected news.

Ada, who had been stubbornly refusing, had suddenly agreed.

"What changed?" Nathaniel stood by the window, his imposing silhouette dark against the glass, eyes sharp with suspicion.

Gordon hesitated. "Rumor is, Victoria somehow got Ada a piece of Evelyn’s jewelry design. That sealed the deal."

Nathaniel scoffed. "Must be a fake."

"Ada’s a collector. Would she fall for a counterfeit?"

Gordon’s expression darkened. "If Victoria signs that contract, the Vanderbilt Hotel falls into her and her mother’s hands. They’ll bleed it dry."

"Evelyn must already know." Nathaniel’s fingers tightened slightly.

With Victoria winning Ada over, he faced a new wave of corporate scheming—more complicated than dealing with Evelyn.

Yet all he could think about was her.

Gordon sighed. "Miss Evelyn’s been quiet these past few days. Maybe she’s given up."

"Given up?" Nathaniel’s lips thinned. "Unlikely. She’s biding her time. When she strikes, Victoria won’t stand a chance."

After all, how could Victoria—with her shallow cunning—outmaneuver his brilliantly ruthless ex-wife?

The thought twisted something in his chest.

That evening, the Vanderbilt family gathered for their monthly dinner at Havenbrook.

The atmosphere was deceptively peaceful. Even Victoria played the dutiful niece, pouring drinks and serving food to Maria as if they were close.

Maria, seated beside Nathaniel, kept her head down, refusing Victoria’s gestures.

She had her pride.

"Father," Frederic began, setting down his fork. "Elspeth and I have been discussing something important. We wanted your advice."

Hamilton chewed slowly. "You’ve already decided. Why ask an old man?"

Elspeth’s smile tightened. These dinners always left her seething.

"Victoria’s of marriageable age," Frederic continued. "We think it’s time to arrange her engagement."

Victoria blushed, biting her lip.

Hamilton’s fork halted mid-air. "She’s only twenty-five. Plenty of time before wedding bells."

"Father, Vanderbilt women never lack suitors," Elspeth interjected sweetly.

Hamilton’s eyes narrowed. "This isn’t some business alliance, is it? Even if the company collapses tomorrow, my granddaughters aren’t bargaining chips."

"Grandpa!" Victoria laughed, shaking his arm. "Mom and Dad just want me happy. I want to get married."

Hamilton blinked. "You do? To whom?"

Elspeth’s eyes sparkled. "Someone you know well—Jareth."

Nathaniel’s jaw tensed, but he remained silent.

"Jareth?" Hamilton repeated, stunned.

"Yes, Father. Mr. Jareth."

Clang.

A fork clattered to the floor.

All eyes turned to Maria, her face pale.

In the Vanderbilts’ etiquette-obsessed world, such a slip was unforgivable.

"I—I’m sorry!" She scrambled to pick it up, but Nathaniel beat her to it.

"It’s fine," he murmured, handing her a fresh one.

"Th-thank you," Maria whispered.

Victoria smirked, savoring her discomfort.
###Chapter 221

"Isabella, how many times must I remind you? Dropping silverware at the table is unacceptable behavior." Eleanor Sinclair's voice was sharp as she reprimanded her granddaughter.

"Oh, come now, it's just a fork! Must you scold the child so harshly?" Reginald Sinclair, ever the doting grandfather, immediately jumped to Isabella's defense.

Eleanor's fingers curled into fists beneath the tablecloth. It seemed that in Reginald's presence, even breathing the wrong way was a crime.

"I'm finished eating." Isabella murmured, her cheeks burning with humiliation as she pushed back her chair and fled the dining room.

As she disappeared, Nathaniel Kingsley watched her go, his expression unreadable. Across the table, Victoria Sterling smirked in satisfaction.

Good, she thought. You could have stayed in your quiet little corner, Isabella. But no—you had to interfere where you didn’t belong. Now you’ll learn your place. Let’s see who truly deserves Alexander’s affection.

"Wait—Alexander?" Reginald frowned in confusion. "I thought he was interested in Evelyn?"

The entire table froze. It was as if a flock of crows had suddenly descended upon them.

Nathaniel, mid-sip of his water, choked violently at his grandfather’s words.

"Grandfather, how could Alexander possibly be interested in Evelyn?" Victoria snapped, her face flushing with anger.

"Didn’t he show clear interest in her at my birthday gala?" Reginald countered. "I may be old, but my eyesight is still sharp. The way he hovered around her—it was obvious. He’s the type who’d be utterly devoted to his wife."

His sharp gaze then landed on Nathaniel. "In fact, I was considering arranging a match between them. The Fairhaven family is prestigious, and Alexander treats Evelyn well. They’d have a comfortable, happy life together."

Comfortable? Happy? Nathaniel’s grip tightened around his glass.

"Grandfather, am I not your granddaughter?" Victoria’s voice trembled with barely suppressed tears. "I’m the one who loves Alexander, not Evelyn! Shouldn’t you support me? Why would you push him toward her?"

"Do you love Alexander?" Reginald asked pointedly. "But does he love you?"

Victoria faltered.

"That night, did he even glance in your direction? Did he speak a single word to you?"

Her jaw clenched, but she couldn’t deny it.

"Love can’t be forced, Victoria. And with Alexander’s temper, you’d be at each other’s throats within a week."

"Father, don’t pressure her like this," Harrison Sinclair interjected. "Alexander does care for Victoria. He even visited her at home—Eleanor and I saw it ourselves."

Victoria’s heart skipped a beat at the mention of that disastrous encounter. She knew Alexander despised her, but so what? Once they were married, she’d win him over.

"Is that so?" Reginald stroked his chin thoughtfully.

"Yes," Eleanor chimed in. "Alexander is a man of status. When has he ever gone out of his way to visit a young woman at her home? His interest is clear. And as for Evelyn—well, I’ve heard she’s already involved with someone else."

Nathaniel’s gaze snapped to Eleanor, icy and dangerous. She stiffened but pressed on. "Sebastian Chambers, the youngest heir of the Chambers Group."

Reginald’s eyebrows shot up. "Evelyn has a suitor? Who?"

"Sebastian Chambers," Eleanor repeated hastily.

This tidbit had come from Arabella, though Victoria had also hinted at Evelyn’s closeness with Sebastian. True or not, it served its purpose—dashing any hopes of an Evelyn-Alexander match.

"Evelyn and Sebastian are not involved."

Nathaniel’s voice was low, but it cut through the room like a blade. He set his glass down with deliberate force, his expression dark.

"Yet I’ve heard they’ve been seen together multiple times—private dinners, concerts—"

"If I say they’re not involved, they’re not."

Nathaniel’s glare was lethal. "Evelyn is a lady of standing—heiress to the Sinclair fortune, CEO of The Grand Marquis. Spreading baseless rumors damages her reputation."

Eleanor’s lips thinned, but she had no retort.

"Nathaniel!" Harrison barked. "Is that any way to speak to your stepmother?"

Without another word, Nathaniel stood, his presence chilling the air. "I’ve lost my appetite. Enjoy your meal."

Reginald watched his grandson stride away, his gaze calculating.

Nathaniel stormed into the garden, loosening his tie with rough, agitated movements.

Ever since Reginald had suggested pairing Alexander with Evelyn, his chest had been tight, restless. And when Eleanor had insinuated Evelyn’s involvement with Sebastian? The air had turned suffocating.

He needed a cigarette.

Pulling one from his pocket, he lit it and exhaled sharply, the smoke curling into the night.

The more he thought about it, the more his irritation flared. He yanked out his phone and dialed.

"Nathaniel. Finally remembered I exist?" Alexander’s voice was laced with lazy amusement. "Since that food poisoning incident, you’ve completely ignored me. Found a new best friend?"

"I need to talk to you." Nathaniel took another drag. "The Sinclairs are pushing for Victoria to marry you."

A beat of silence. Then—

"What the hell?"

Alexander’s shout was loud enough to make Nathaniel pull the phone away from his ear.

"You’re joking. Tell me you’re joking."

"Do I sound like I’m joking?"

"Damn it, Nathaniel! You know what Victoria’s like! You’re not playing matchmaker—you’re throwing me into a pit of vipers!"

"She’s troublesome, but you’re worse. Perfect match, don’t you think?" Nathaniel exhaled smoke, his tone dry. "You always said it didn’t matter who you married—that they were just decoration."

"I did, but—"

"So why not Victoria? She’s infatuated with you, and the Sinclair name is nothing to scoff at."

"Because she’s insufferable! You’re not setting me up—you’re sacrificing me!"

Nathaniel smirked humorlessly. "Every rogue meets his match. She can’t outmaneuver you."

"Not funny."

"Sebastian can’t have her."

The words slipped out before Nathaniel could stop them. His jaw clenched.

He felt like a man swatting away flies around Evelyn—desperate to keep every unwanted suitor at bay.
###Chapter 222

The counterfeit necklace Glynnis had obtained from Edith worked like magic.

When she discreetly presented it to Ada, she'd braced herself for humiliation, terrified Ada would spot the forgery and she'd become a laughingstock. But even if Ada discovered the truth, Glynnis had a backup plan—she'd claim she'd been duped by a so-called friend, that her jewelry knowledge was limited and she'd been easily fooled.

To her shock, whether due to the apprentice's craftsmanship or Ada's lack of discernment, Ada didn't notice the necklace was fake. In fact, she was so thrilled she put it on immediately and refused to take it off.

Finally, Ada and Glynnis officially signed the contract.

With Elspeth tirelessly singing her praises to Frederic, Glynnis even secured a promotion to board member, earning a coveted seat in the group's high-level meetings!

That evening, Elspeth and her daughter lounged on the balcony, sipping celebratory champagne ahead of time.

"Once Ada's wedding is over, your father will officially hand the hotel to you," Elspeth murmured, arms wrapped around her daughter, eyes gleaming with ambition. "You've taken the first step toward success. In time, you'll join the board of directors, and together, we'll drive that scoundrel Thaddeus out!"

"Don't worry, Mother," Glynnis replied, clinking her glass against Elspeth's. "Once I solidify my position, I'll dismantle Thaddeus's power piece by piece. The Abernathy Group will be ours."

Just then, the butler's voice echoed from the doorway.

"Madam, Miss Glynnis, an invitation has arrived for both of you."

Elspeth and Glynnis exchanged glances before stepping inside.

"Who sent it?" Glynnis demanded.

"The secretary of the general manager of K World Hotel—Mr. Dempsey."

From Evadne?

"Understood. You may leave." Elspeth took the envelope and shut the door.

Inside were two invitations to a charity jewelry auction. Elspeth's grip tightened, her expression darkening.

"Mother, Evadne's been quiet for weeks. Why send us an invitation now? Is this a trap?" Glynnis asked nervously.

"Pfft, what's there to fear?" Elspeth scoffed. "Ada's already signed the contract. Even if Evadne tries to interfere, it's too late."

Coincidentally, the evening news flashed on the TV, featuring the charity auction.

"Mother!" Glynnis gasped, pointing at the screen. "The event is sponsored by Ethereal Vogue!"

Her nails dug into her palms as envy flared. Ethereal Vogue—the world-renowned fashion bible, the holy grail for celebrities. And Evadne was hosting an event for them? The news even mentioned Ada and other A-listers attending.

"No matter how grand she makes this, she's already lost," Elspeth muttered. "But since she invited us, we'll go. Keep an eye on her—make sure she doesn't sabotage our plans with Ada."

Meanwhile, Evadne had just finished a cheerful call with Ethereal Vogue's editor-in-chief, speaking flawless English without hesitation.

As she changed into workout gear for a late-night kayak session, Cassius arrived.

"Cassius!"

She dashed downstairs and threw herself into his arms.

Seeing her snug attire accentuating her curves, Cassius frowned. "You're exercising now? It's freezing."

"Yes! I'm in a great mood—perfect for kayaking." She tilted her head back, grinning.

"It's pitch black. What if you capsize? You're not exactly a strong swimmer." He pinched her waist lightly. "And you're not dressed warmly enough. You'll catch a cold."

Turning to Jason, he added sternly, "Miss Evadne has no one else watching over her. Why aren't you looking out for her?"

"My apologies, President Ashbourne," Jason said, bowing.

"Cassius, don't blame him," Evadne interjected. "He did warn me, but he can't change my mind."

The siblings settled onto the couch, Evadne resting her head against Cassius's shoulder. "Cassius, Ethereal Vogue's editor-in-chief just finalized the event details. Thank you for securing such a high-profile connection! I've adored Ethereal Vogue since I was a child."

Iris, the editor-in-chief, was a titan in fashion—her disapproval could ruin brands. That she'd personally called Evadne spoke volumes.

"I'm glad you're happy," Cassius said warmly, brushing her nose. "I know you've been down since Ada went to Abernathy. You always need a distraction, so I thought this might help."

"Psh, I'm fine," Evadne pouted. "I've been eating well, sleeping soundly—I haven't given it a second thought."

Jason bit his lip, heart racing as he watched her cheeks flush pink. Only around Cassius did Miss Evadne show this girlish side.

"You say that, but your dark circles disagree," Cassius sighed, rubbing beneath her eyes.

"Oh, that's not why. Wait—Cassius, how do you even know Iris? You two seem close. She's trusting me with this massive event! Ethereal Vogue has never hosted anything in Elmsworth before!"

Cassius shrugged. "We're not close."

"Then why—?"

"She's had a crush on me for about a decade."

Evadne and Jason gasped. "What?"

"I've rejected her multiple times, but she's persistent. I just ignore it."

"Fashion queen Iris is nearly fifty, right?" Evadne blurted.

Even in his thirties, Cassius was undeniably the younger one in this scenario.

"How pathetic," Evadne sighed.

"Indeed. A fifty-year-old admirer is... pressure," Jason added.

"No, no—I meant Iris is pathetic!" Evadne huffed, defensive of her idol. "Age isn't the issue. The issue is she picked the wrong man! The fashion queen falling for a confirmed bachelor? It's a miracle you haven't scared her off yet, let alone dated her!"

Cassius and Jason exchanged glances, speechless.
###Chapter 223

The day of the charity jewelry auction at The Regal Palace arrived in a flash.

Despite minimal prior publicity from The Regal Palace and Vogue Paris, the charity connection ensured extensive media coverage from New York's elite press.

Vogue Paris stood as a global fashion authority. Its coveted cover had sparked fierce competition among celebrities, showcasing its immense influence. Today's event brimmed with stars. Security teams remained on high alert to control the crowds. Celebrities waved briefly to fans before hurrying inside to prevent potential chaos.

The atmosphere electrified when a sleek stretched Lincoln pulled up.

Bodyguards opened the door, revealing Isabella and Victoria Sinclair in dazzling evening gowns.

Unlike other socialites who preferred discreet entrances, these two craved the spotlight as if they'd wither without constant camera flashes.

"Isn't that Arabella's aunt?" someone shouted, the words slicing through the crowd to Isabella's ears. Her face darkened instantly.

After years shedding labels like "washed-up actress" and "homewrecker," being reduced to "Arabella's aunt" felt like fresh humiliation. The biological truth didn't soften the insult.

As murmurs spread, Isabella's complexion shifted from crimson to ashen. Without Victoria's support, she might have collapsed.

Isabella had hoped time erased the scandal. But some stains became permanent. Her carefully constructed dignity lay shattered by that wretched Arabella.

Amidst the whispers, the Sinclair women entered the hotel, faces burning.

"Mother, perhaps avoid public events," Victoria muttered. "Your disgrace reflects on me. It's unbearable."

"Ungrateful child!" Isabella hissed, digging nails into her daughter's arm. "I endured scorn carrying you into the Vanderbilt family. Now you're ashamed of me?"

Victoria clutched her bruised arm, desperate to escape her mother's venom.

The evening unfolded in two acts: a cocktail reception followed by the auction. The glittering gathering resembled an entertainment industry reunion.

Seraphina, as hotel manager and event organizer, faced media scrutiny with poised grace.

"President Lockwood," a reporter pressed, "After Ada switched her wedding to Vanderbilt Hotel, now hosting Vogue Paris' charity event - are you challenging the Vanderbilts?"

Seraphina's smile remained unshaken. "Naturally people draw comparisons, given our historic rivalry. But Vogue Paris chose us independently. These are coincidences."

"Why did Ada cancel her contract with The Regal Palace? Were there issues?"

"That involves confidential contracts I can't discuss," Seraphina deflected.

"Was it because her venue details leaked?" the reporter persisted.

Seraphina's gaze chilled. Someone had planted this interrogator.

Nearby, Vanessa sipped champagne, smirking at Seraphina's discomfort. The troublesome reporter was her doing.

If she couldn't topple Seraphina, at least she'd rattle her.

Just then, the Sinclair women approached.

Victoria, clutching her trump card, faced Seraphina with newfound confidence.

"You're correct," Seraphina suddenly confirmed, her smile vanishing. "That was indeed the reason."

Gasps erupted.

Vanessa frowned. She hadn't anticipated such blunt honesty.

What game was Seraphina playing?

"Ladies and gentlemen," Isabella interjected, "Don't trouble Ms. Lockwood further. She's already overwhelmed with breach issues."

Victoria lifted her chin smugly. "But don't despair, Ms. Lockwood. Learn from this failure. We Vanderbilts will certainly handle client confidentiality better."
###Chapter 224

Glynnis's voice cut through the air like a siren's call, commanding everyone's attention. The bombshell she dropped sent shockwaves through the crowd.

She made it crystal clear - the blame rested solely on K Orld Hotel's shoulders. Ada had been wronged in this entire fiasco.

With surgical precision, she pointed out Evadne's failures as general manager. The woman couldn't even manage her own hotel properly, yet rushed to host high-profile events despite contractual obligations.

Her accusations painted a damning picture - negligence in client services, security breaches, and overall incompetence from K Orld Hotel's leadership.

The unspoken comparison hung heavy in the air. Abernathy Group's properties clearly outclassed K Orld in every conceivable way.

Reporters fired questions at Evadne like bullets, their pens poised to document her downfall.

This was a calculated public execution, masterminded by the mother-daughter duo barely concealing their smug grins beneath layers of makeup.

How utterly predictable.

Just then, two industry powerhouses made their entrance - Ada and Iris, fashion and entertainment royalty respectively.

They arrived just in time to witness Evadne being torn apart by Glynnis and the media frenzy.

Behind her designer sunglasses, Iris remained unflappable as she observed Evadne's composure. She nudged Ada. "You might want to reconsider cutting ties with Ms. Evadne."

"Why's that?" Ada arched a perfectly sculpted brow.

"Because her brother Cassius is absolute perfection." Iris's voice took on a dreamy quality, her eyes sparkling behind the tinted lenses. "I'm serious - he's the most breathtaking man I've ever seen. Total husband material."

Ada blinked. "And this relates to my business decisions how?"

Iris adopted a conspiratorial whisper. "As your future sister-in-law, couldn't you give Ms. Evadne another chance?"

Ada nearly choked. Was this emotional blackmail?

Meanwhile, unnoticed on the second-floor balcony...

Thaddeus stood like a sentinel, his dark gaze tracking the drama below before settling on Evadne's unreadable expression. The ghost of a smile touched his lips.

He knew better than to underestimate her.

Ms. Ashbourne didn't just weather storms - she thrived in them.

"Mr. Thaddeus!" Gordon fretted beside him. "Mrs. Abernathy's being crucified down there! Shouldn't we intervene before the press destroys her reputation?"

"No." Thaddeus's jaw tightened. "Even if this is a setup, my involvement as Abernathy Group's CEO would only complicate matters. She's got a plan - I won't disrupt it."

Understanding dawned on Gordon. Mrs. Abernathy played by her own rules. Interfering would be unwise.

Besides, Thaddeus's standing with Evadne was already precarious. Any intervention now would only earn her contempt.

"Two tasks," Thaddeus commanded in that voice that brooked no argument.

"Sir?"

"That loose-lipped reporter? Ensure he never works in journalism again."

"Consider it done."

"Second - mobilize Abernathy Group's PR team. Monitor all online chatter. Any negative mention of Evadne or K Orld Hotel gets scrubbed immediately."

Gordon nodded and hurried off.

Alone now, Thaddeus's gaze softened as he watched Evadne's defiant posture.

"No worries, darling," he thought. "Let them have their little show. I'll be your safety net."

Downstairs, the spectacle continued.

"Ms. Evadne," Elspeth purred, unable to resist twisting the knife, "we at Abernathy Group do regret this unfortunate situation with Miss Ada. But you're young - mistakes happen. What matters is learning from them."

Evadne's smile remained inscrutable. "Indeed, I underestimated certain... malicious elements this time. Consider it a lesson learned."

Elspeth barely suppressed a sneer.

"Are you suggesting you were framed, President Ashbourne?" a reporter blurted.

"Ladies and gentlemen," Evadne smoothly redirected, "the charity auction begins shortly. Shall we proceed?" She glided toward the event space without so much as a backward glance at her detractors.

The mother-daughter duo seethed, their anticipated victory feeling hollow.

"That little witch," Elspeth hissed, watching Evadne's retreating figure. "Does she really think vague insinuations will save her?"

Glynnis squeezed her mother's arm excitedly. "She didn't even defend herself! After this, we'll have every paper run stories exposing her incompetence!"

"Elspeth! Glynnis!"

Edith chose this moment to make her entrance, skirts swishing gracefully. "Darlings!"

"Edith!" Elspeth embraced her warmly. "We've been looking everywhere for you!"

"Mom, it's all thanks to Edith we secured Ada's signature," Glynnis gushed.

Edith waved a modest hand. "Oh please, it was nothing."

"Sweet girl," Elspeth cooed, stroking Edith's hand with calculated affection. "Remember - anything you need, just ask."
###Chapter 225

The grand hall buzzed with anticipation as guests streamed in for the upcoming auction.

Isabella Sinclair slipped away from the relentless media, retreating into the quiet sanctuary of the corridor.

"Miss Isabella!" Olivia Bennett hurried to her side, her expression tight with concern. "Are you alright?"

"Just a few persistent journalists." Isabella arched a brow, her voice cool. "What’s the worst they could do? Stir up a little drama?"

Her gaze remained steady, though a faint crease formed between her brows. "You shouldn’t be here with me. The event needs you."

"But I’m worried about you." Olivia’s voice dropped to a husky whisper. "Those reporters were clearly planted. Someone sent them to humiliate you—dragging up old mistakes like that!"

"Isn’t that expected?" Isabella crossed her arms, unbothered. "When you host a charity gala, you don’t get only applause. Besides, they weren’t wrong. My past oversights gave those gaudy peacocks the perfect opening to peck at me. I own that."

Gaudy peacocks.

The image of Arabella Sinclair and her daughter flashed in Olivia’s mind.

"One thing you said, though—I disagree." Isabella leaned against the wall, tracing idle patterns on her arm. "Those journalists weren’t sent to ruin me. They were sent to help me."

A slow, dangerous smile curved her lips. "Let Arabella have her moment. I specialize in letting my enemies think they’ve won—right before I watch them crash and burn. It’s delicious."

Olivia shivered at the dark glint in Isabella’s eyes. This woman was every bit as ruthless as Alexander Kingsley. A rose, breathtakingly beautiful—but laced with thorns and venom.

With the event demanding her attention, Olivia reluctantly returned to the hall.

Isabella had been running nonstop since dawn, surviving on nothing but a rushed breakfast. No lunch. No dinner. Not even water.

Exhausted, she collapsed onto a plush couch, kicking off her heels. Her bare feet curled against the cushions as hunger gnawed at her stomach.

So hungry.

Her eyelids fluttered shut.

Then—

The rich, decadent scent of chocolate teased her senses.

She must be hallucinating. Her nose twitched, following the aroma like a starved puppy.

"Are you just going to sniff it?"

A deep, icy voice cut through the haze.

Her heart lurched. Eyes flying open, she found herself staring into Nathaniel Kingsley’s piercing gaze.

Those eyes—always lethal, no matter the time or place.

Now, sprawled on the couch, she watched as Nathaniel knelt before her, holding out a chocolate cupcake.

Her hands, pressed against her hollow stomach, clenched.

In their three years of marriage, Nathaniel had never once bent his knee for her.

Back when she’d loved him recklessly, chasing him like a moth to flame, she had been the one crying. The one humiliated.

The memories stung. Her throat tightened, eyes burning.

Nathaniel frowned when she didn’t move. "Aren’t you hungry? It’s your favorite. Not poisoned."

"I’m not eating." Her voice cracked.

"Olivia said your stomach’s sensitive. Skipping meals hurts you."

"I said no!"

Tears spilled over as she slapped the cupcake from his hand. It hit the floor, shattered.

"Isabella!"

Nathaniel stared at the ruined dessert, then at her. Disappointment crashed over him like icy waves.

It wasn’t just the cupcake she’d destroyed.

It was his heart.

"What the hell is wrong with you?" His voice was raw. "Can’t you tell when someone’s trying to help?"

She sat up, hunger forgotten beneath the storm of emotions. "I hate when you’re nice to me for no reason. It feels like an insult."

His jaw tightened. "You’re being irrational."

"Stay away from me." She stood, wincing at the pain in her stomach but refusing to show weakness. "Is this because Vanessa left you? Don’t dump your leftover affection on me. I’m not your consolation prize."

Nathaniel’s fists clenched. Humiliation and fury darkened his eyes.

All he’d done was bring her food. And she’d twisted it into something ugly.

Isabella straightened her dress, her back rigid as she walked away.

Nathaniel picked up the crushed cupcake, watching her go. The ache in his chest was suffocating.

The Isabella who used to smile at him was gone.

Their failed marriage had scarred her too deeply. Now, even his smallest kindness made her recoil—like a soldier flinching from phantom gunfire.

His lips trembled as he crushed the dessert in his palm.

Some wounds never healed.

Some mistakes couldn’t be undone.

Back in the hall, the auction hadn’t yet begun.

As icons of fashion and entertainment, Seraphina Lockwood and Charlotte Dubois drew swarms of media. Arabella chatted with socialites, while Arabella’s daughter and Victoria Sterling schemed separately.

Arabella’s daughter aimed to snag a photo with Charlotte, then milk more interviews. After all, she had secured the collaboration—she wanted the world to know.

Victoria, meanwhile, hoped to pose with Seraphina, believing it would boost her fashion credibility.

"Miss Charlotte! You’re wearing the necklace I gifted you!" Arabella’s daughter gushed, seizing her chance. "You must love it!"

Cameras flashed as Charlotte forced a smile. "Of course. It’s a Maison de Valois piece."

She might despise the girl’s tacky demeanor, but with the Vanderbilt Group sponsoring her wedding, she couldn’t afford to snub her. So she draped an arm around her waist for the photo.

Arabella’s daughter nearly vibrated with glee.

"Miss Charlotte!" A reporter called. "Will you be bidding tonight or donating?"

Charlotte’s smile turned genuine. "I’m donating a very special piece of jewelry."

"Ooh! Can you give us a hint?"

"Patience." She winked. "You’ll see."

Nearby, Victoria mustered her courage and approached Seraphina.

"Ms. Lockwood! Wait, please!"

Seraphina paused, glancing over her sunglasses at the girl in the ill-fitting haute couture dress.

No recognition. Just another clueless socialite with more money than taste.

"Ms. Lockwood, I’ve adored Vogue Paris since I was little!" Victoria gushed, cheeks pink. "I’m your biggest fan!"

"Since childhood?" Seraphina’s tone was dry. "How old do you think I am?"

"N-no! I didn’t mean—!"

But Seraphina was already walking away.

Victoria’s face paled.

Then—

"Mr. Kingsley! There you are!"

Seraphina’s entire demeanor shifted as she spotted Isabella, striding forward with a radiant smile.

As if they were lifelong friends.
###Chapter 226

The crowd gasped as all eyes—and cameras—snapped toward Isabella Sinclair.

"I'm so sorry, Ms. Iris. I didn't realize you were waiting for me."

Isabella blinked, caught off guard. The usually unflappable CEO actually felt her cheeks warm.

Behind her oversized sunglasses, Iris's eyes crinkled with amusement. "No need to apologize. You've had quite the night."

Then, to everyone's shock, Iris looped an arm around Isabella's shoulders like they were old friends. "Hey, everyone! Get some shots of us, will you?"

Isabella's lips parted in surprise.

Holy hell.

Iris, the untouchable queen of fashion, was voluntarily posing for photos—with her?

The whispers exploded.

President Sinclair truly was something else. Even the most elite figures couldn't resist bending to her charm.

Nearby, Victoria Sterling and Miranda Chen's faces soured.

Especially Miranda. Humiliation burned through her veins, ringing in her ears like a siren.

Why?

How?

Was Isabella coated in some kind of irresistible pheromone? Why did every powerful figure flock to her like moths to a flame?

She couldn't comprehend it!

Isabella forced herself to stay composed, but her heart pounded like an overworked kettle as she smiled for the cameras. At least some of her dignity had been restored.

Once the photos were done, Isabella and Iris slipped into a quiet corner.

"Ms. Iris, I can't thank you enough for what you did back there." Isabella's voice was genuine. "You saw the mess I was in. That photo op was a lifeline."

"Ms. Sinclair." Iris adjusted her sunglasses. "I'm hosting this event. We're in this together."

Isabella gave a wry smile. She knew the truth. "Still, I appreciate it."

"Don't misunderstand." Iris's gaze softened, almost maternal. "This wasn't about the event. It was about your brother, Sebastian. He asked me to look out for you tonight."

Isabella's breath hitched.

Sebastian. Always worrying, always protecting—even from afar.

But Iris's feelings for him were far from platonic.

And Sebastian knew that.

Was he really using her affection to shield Isabella? That was...

"Ms. Sinclair, I heard about Ada canceling your collaboration. That must sting."

Iris's tone turned serious. "Ada and I go way back. I'll talk to her about the wedding planning rights. Maybe I can help."

"No!" Isabella shook her head vehemently. "You've done more than enough. I couldn't possibly—"

"Afraid of owing me, little lady?" Iris chuckled, patting her shoulder. "Relax. I don't expect anything in return. Sebastian must've told you how I feel about him, right?"

Isabella pressed her lips together and nodded.

"You're his precious sister. The people he loves? They matter to me too." Iris's eyes glowed with devotion. "I've loved him for ten years without asking for a thing. Just being allowed to keep loving him is enough."

Isabella was speechless.

What kind of black magic had Sebastian worked on this woman?

Damn. He had her wrapped.

Outside, Nathaniel Prescott exhaled a cloud of smoke, his third cigarette of the night.

It did nothing to ease the weight in his chest.

The auction was about to start. With a sigh, he crushed the cigarette and headed back inside.

Tall and brooding, Nathaniel moved down the left corridor.

At the opposite end, another figure approached—just as striking, just as dangerous.

They stopped simultaneously at the venue entrance.

Their eyes locked.

The air between them crackled with tension.

Nathaniel's gaze was ice.

Mr. Avery adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses, smirking. "Mr. Prescott. Here to donate to charity like the rest of us?"

Nathaniel's lips curled. "Not as generous as you. I'm just here to support her."

Her.

Isabella.

Avery's smile froze. His fists clenched.

The main event began.

Two ways to participate: donate items or bid on them.

All proceeds went to national charities—fully transparent, no shady dealings.

This marked Ethereal Vogue's 15th annual charity gala. Would tonight break fundraising records?

Nathaniel and Avery's arrival sent ripples through the crowd.

But since this was Isabella's night, both men kept low profiles, blending into the back.

Isabella, oblivious to Avery's presence, sat up front with Iris, chatting animatedly.

Miranda, watching from a distance, seethed with envy.

The auctioneer lifted the velvet cloth, revealing the first item.

"A stunning emerald-cut diamond necklace from the private collection of Chambers Group's chairwoman! An absolute masterpiece!"

Gasps filled the room.

The first item alone was a showstopper—a massive win for Isabella's event.

Her head whipped around, scanning the crowd for Avery.

She spotted him tucked in a shadowed corner.

Their eyes met.

Avery gave a subtle nod.

Isabella's lips curved in response.

Across the room, Nathaniel saw it all.

His grip on the auction paddle tightened until the wood groaned.
###Chapter 227

The moment the emerald and diamond necklace was unveiled, the entire ballroom erupted in gasps.

Every discerning eye could see the flawless cut of the diamonds, the impeccable craftsmanship—this was a masterpiece worth millions.

For the Chambers Group to donate such a priceless piece to a charity auction? They were making a statement.

A spotlight suddenly illuminated Avery's striking figure as he stood near the stage.

Whispers rippled through the crowd as heads turned. His sharp features and aristocratic poise drew admiring glances.

But his gaze, dark and intense, was locked solely on Evadne. As if she were the only person in the room.

"Who is that? He's breathtaking!"

"Must be the Chambers heir. Who else could afford such extravagance?"

"Is he involved with Evadne?"

"Why not? She's stunning. They'd make a perfect match."

The murmurs grated on Thaddeus' nerves.

Perfect match? What nonsense.

Avery's smooth, beardless face and those calculating eyes reminded him of nothing but scheming villains from history books.

"The emerald and diamond necklace starts at two hundred thousand. Bidding begins now!"

Paddles shot up instantly.

"Three hundred thousand!"

"Four hundred!"

"Four fifty!"

"Five hundred!"

The energy in the room was electric, the competition fierce.

Evadne had been nursing a headache earlier.

But watching the bids skyrocket? Instant cure. Money was the best medicine.

Meanwhile, Elspeth and Glynnis looked like they'd swallowed poison.

They'd come expecting Evadne to embarrass herself. Instead, the auction was a roaring success. Their petty attempts to undermine her now seemed laughable.

"Mom! Avery's here representing the Chambers Group, throwing money at her like it's nothing!" Glynnis hissed, jealousy twisting her features.

Elspeth smirked. "Jealous?"

"Of course I am!" Glynnis tugged at her dress, frustration boiling over. "No man has ever treated me like that. Not just her brothers—Jareth, Avery, even Thaddeus isn't as cold to her anymore. What does she have that I don't?"

She dreamed of Evadne's life—adored, spoiled, surrounded by powerful men.

But what did she have?

A useless sister and shattered pride.

"Stop whining," Elspeth pinched her thigh sharply, making Glynnis yelp. "You're my daughter. Act like it."

She shot Evadne a venomous glare. "Jareth is yours. That marriage will happen. As for Avery? Let her have him. The more she tangles with that worthless heir, the better."

Glynnis frowned. "But if she marries into the Chambers family—"

"She’d be digging her own grave," Elspeth sneered. "Avery’s a disgrace to his father. No shares, no power. If Evadne shackles herself to him? Perfect."

By now, the necklace had reached six million.

The room quieted.

Evadne was thrilled—this was an incredible start.

Then—

"Seven hundred thousand."

A deep, commanding voice cut through the silence.

Evadne’s smile vanished.

Gasps filled the air.

Thaddeus sat in the front row, paddle raised, his expression unreadable.

"Thaddeus Abernathy? When did he arrive?"

"So low-key yet so extravagant!"

His gaze burned into Evadne’s back.

Seven hundred thousand, and she didn’t even glance his way?

Fine. He’d spend more.

"This is ridiculous," Iris muttered. "Such a waste."

"The more fools like him, the better for charity," Evadne said coldly, mentally cursing him.

"Sold to Mr. Abernathy! Thank you for your generosity!"

Applause erupted.

Thaddeus barely smiled for the cameras.

Avery adjusted his glasses, his stare icy.

The auction continued smoothly.

Jewelry sold for staggering sums—even Elspeth made a token bid.

But what infuriated Evadne was Thaddeus deliberately overpaying for pieces no one wanted.

In an hour, he’d spent over three million on three worthless items.

She wanted to strangle him.

"That piece isn’t worth four hundred thousand. Is Thaddeus blind?"

"Or maybe he’s doing it on purpose?"

"He’s only bidding on the cheap items. It’s obvious—he’s helping Evadne."

Edith’s fists clenched, nails digging into her palms.

The man she longed for was throwing money at Evadne—who couldn’t care less. The humiliation burned.

Thaddeus smirked at the whispers.

At least someone understood.

Too bad Evadne still refused to look at him.

His smirk faded.

"Pathetic," Avery muttered.

Did Thaddeus think Evadne could be bought?

"Next, we have a stunning teardrop diamond necklace, surrounded by blue diamonds—donated by Miss Ada!"

The moment the necklace was unveiled, Glynnis turned white.

Edith froze, fingers twisting together.
###Chapter 228

The crowd gasped in shock as Isabella Sinclair donated the necklace right in the middle of the auction.

Unbelievable.

Victoria Sterling shot a frantic glance at Sophia Reynolds. Their eyes locked across the room, but neither could speak.

The reveal of Alexander Dubois' masterpiece sent electric waves through the audience.

Jewelry connoisseurs and fashion elites craned their necks, desperate to catch a glimpse of the legendary designer’s dazzling creation.

Nathaniel Hawthorne and Sebastian Lockwood, long-time admirers of Alexander Dubois, fixed their gazes on the piece.

Both men tightened their grips on their bidding paddles, ready to duel.

"Victoria, sit down! Everyone’s staring!" Margaret Laurent hissed, yanking her daughter back into the seat.

"Mother, something’s wrong!" Victoria’s voice trembled as she collapsed into the chair.

"What happened?"

"The necklace Isabella donated—it’s the one I gave her."

"You gave it? Where did you get an Alexander Dubois piece?"

Margaret froze, then fury twisted her features. "That wretched woman is throwing away a priceless gift, and you let her? How could you allow her to humiliate us like this? Why didn’t you give it to me instead of that actress? I raised you better!"

"Mother… it’s fake," Victoria confessed, sweat beading on her forehead.

Margaret’s heart lurched. "What did you say?"

"It was Sophia’s idea. She had Alexander’s apprentice replicate it."

Victoria stammered, "Isabella refused to sign the contract, so I had to win her over like Evelyn did. The necklace was flawless—from one of Alexander’s obscure collections. Isabella didn’t notice. I knew the truth would come out eventually, but by then, the contract would be signed, and it’d be too late. But I never thought she’d donate it! If this gets exposed, our family’s reputation is ruined!"

"You absolute fool!" Margaret dug her nails into Victoria’s arm. "Even if you couldn’t give her the real thing, you should’ve never handed her a fake! If this blows up, the Vanderbilts will be a laughingstock!"

"It wasn’t my idea! Sophia suggested it—don’t blame me!" Victoria whined.

"Can’t you see she’s using you?" Margaret seethed. "If this isn’t exposed, you get the contract and she gets rid of Evelyn. If it is, the necklace was donated under the Vanderbilt name. Sophia loses nothing—you take the fall!"

Victoria’s stomach dropped. She cursed her own naivety.

"Mother! What do we do?"

"We improvise." Margaret steadied herself. "Alexander has countless pieces worldwide. Who’s to say this one’s fake? Isabella didn’t notice. No one else will either."

Victoria exhaled shakily, but dread still coiled in her chest.

Isabella rose, microphone in hand, and smiled at the crowd.

Her gaze landed on Victoria, who paled.

"I’d like to thank Miss Victoria for this necklace—it was her generous gift."

Evelyn casually texted Jason backstage.

A spotlight suddenly pinned Victoria in place like a deer in headlights.

The overhead screen magnified her frozen expression in high definition.

Victoria forced a stiff smile, internally screaming.

"As a devoted fan of Alexander’s work, I believe in giving back. His philosophy was about more than beauty—it was about impact. I hope Miss Victoria approves of my decision to auction this piece for charity."

Victoria had no choice but to nod, praying the spotlight would vanish.

"Given its rarity, bidding starts with no reserve!"

The crowd hesitated.

"Three million dollars."

Sebastian raised his paddle, lips quirking.

Three million? The highest bid yet.

Though worth the price, the steep opening deterred others.

"Five million." Nathaniel countered, face unreadable—but his eyes burned with determination.

The audience gasped. Did he print money at home?

"Seven million." Sebastian didn’t flinch.

"Nine million."

"Ten million."

The room erupted.

Evelyn crossed her arms, unamused. "They’re not bidding—they’re brawling."

"Like two peacocks in a turf war," Olivia muttered.

Evelyn considered confiscating their paddles.

Meanwhile, Margaret gaped.

"Mother, you said he was broke! Since when does a penniless man bid ten million?"

Margaret had no answer.

Had she underestimated him? Was this some twisted power play?

"Twelve million." Nathaniel remained stone-faced.

"Fifteen million."

Evelyn’s voice cut through the tension like ice.

She’d had enough.
###Chapter 229

Thaddeus and Isabella's hearts lurched in unison, their gazes snapping toward Evadne.

Both harbored deep affection for her and immediately recognized her distress. Without hesitation, they withdrew from the bidding, raising their hands in surrender. The auctioneer, ever perceptive, wasted no time in declaring Evadne the winner, securing the necklace for her amidst thunderous applause.

Yet Evadne remained impassive, her expression unreadable.

"Evadne bought the counterfeit we planted! Does she realize it's fake?" Glynnis whispered frantically, her pulse racing.

"Quiet! Do you want everyone to hear?" Elspeth snapped, her eyes burning with resentment. "Of course she doesn't know. She'd never expect a fake at her own event. She just donated a fortune to your charity."

"But what if she finds out?" Glynnis fretted.

"Once it leaves here, it's not your problem. Who's to say it wasn't swapped? Or that she's trying to frame you?" Elspeth hissed venomously.

Ada smirked with satisfaction as she watched Evadne overpay for her donated necklace.

Perhaps Evadne still clung to hopes of collaboration. Why else would she go to such lengths?

At that moment, Evadne's bright eyes darkened. She texted Jason, then adjusted her seating with the poised anticipation of an audience member awaiting a spectacle.

When the velvet cover was lifted, the auctioneer's rehearsed speech faltered. He stared at the teardrop diamond in the display case, then back at his notes. Something was wrong.

As the spotlight illuminated the jewelry, gasps rippled through the crowd.

"Isn't that the necklace Ada just donated?"

"It's identical!"

"Impossible! Alea's pieces are one-of-a-kind. How can there be duplicates?"

"Then one must be fake!"

The room buzzed with speculation, fingers pointing at the displayed necklace.

Ada leaned forward, stunned, as if struck by lightning.

Elspeth and Glynnis clutched each other's hands, Glynnis' spine prickling with cold sweat.

Her gift to Ada was counterfeit.

Which meant only one thing—the necklace on stage was genuine.

"Ms. Evadne," Iris asked with genuine concern rather than accusation, "didn't you authenticate the items beforehand? How could this happen?"

"Who's truly at fault here, Ms. Iris? Me, or Ms. Ada?" Evadne countered with a knowing smile.

Iris gasped. "This necklace—could it be—?"

As murmurs swelled, Evadne rose gracefully and approached the stage.

Thaddeus watched her, his heart hammering beneath his tailored suit, skin burning with anticipation.

"Ladies and gentlemen," Evadne began with a deep bow, "as host of the Ethereal Vogue gala, I apologize for this disruption to your evening."

The room hushed.

"Secondly," she continued, lips curving, "the 'Whispering Waters' necklace was my personal donation."

The crowd turned as one to Ada, who sat frozen, desperately seeking Glynnis' help.

But Glynnis could only stare helplessly at Edith's empty seat—she'd already fled.

Evadne surveyed the ridiculous charade with amusement. "Ms. Ada, I wasn't aware you'd be donating this piece tonight. Quite the coincidence. I hope there are no misunderstandings."

"President Ashbourne," Ada demanded, her composure cracking, "why do you possess a Whispering Waters necklace?"

"The real question, Ms. Ada, isn't why I have it—but why yours is counterfeit," Evadne replied, her smile vanishing.

The room erupted in shock.

Elspeth maintained her facade, but Glynnis turned ghostly pale.

"My necklace was a gift from the Abernathy Group! How dare you accuse me—" Ada protested.

"Ms. Evadne," Elspeth interjected sharply, "you'd better have proof before slandering my daughter's reputation!"

"I wouldn't make such claims without evidence," Evadne said calmly, eyes glinting mischievously.

Thaddeus straightened, captivated by her fox-like smirk—once irritating, now endearing.

"Miss Evadne! Where's your proof?"

"Ada's a seasoned collector—wouldn't she spot a fake?"

"Exactly! You can't just—"

The protests died as the grand doors burst open.

All heads turned.

A striking blonde entered, her heels clicking authoritatively.

Thaddeus did a double take. Liva? Here?

"It's Liva! Alea Studio's director!" someone exclaimed.

"Perfect! Who better to authenticate Alea's work?"

Under the crowd's watchful gaze, Liva approached Evadne, who greeted her warmly.

"Liva."

To everyone's astonishment, Liva took Evadne's hand and pressed a reverent kiss to it—the highest sign of respect in Aetheria.

"Forgive my tardiness, Miss Alea," Liva murmured.
###Chapter 230

The room plunged into stunned silence before erupting in gasps.

"Isabella Sinclair... is Alea?"

Nathaniel Prescott's mind reeled, his thoughts scattering like shattered glass. His body went numb, limbs heavy as if weighed down by the revelation.

Isabella was Alea.

She was the legendary icon of the jewelry world.

All this time, she had watched him humiliate himself—chasing after Alea, only to be rejected repeatedly. She must have been laughing at him this whole time.

Nathaniel's chest heaved, lips trembling. His eyes burned with fury—or was it disbelief? He couldn't tell which emotion was stronger.

"Isabella... you deceived me again. You actually deceived me again!"

She had unparalleled talent, yet she hid it from him flawlessly.

For three years of marriage, she had shed her legendary status and played the role of a dutiful wife, standing quietly by his side.

Why? Was this her way of mocking his ignorance?

His jaw clenched, fingers digging into his chest as if trying to stop his heart from splintering.

Is this amusing to you, Isabella? You were never honest with me. How dare you expect me to fall in love with you?

"Alea? Miss Sinclair is Alea? This is earth-shattering news!"

"It can't be fake, can it?"

"The necklace could be counterfeit, but the person can't! Liva is here—this is undeniable proof!"

The room, usually filled with composed elites, descended into chaos. Phones were whipped out, flashes blinding as they captured the living legend before them.

This was Alea in the flesh. They had to document this moment—otherwise, what was the point of attending tonight?

Alexander Kingsley watched as Isabella stood at the center of the storm, radiant as a celestial body, and a smirk tugged at his lips.

No other woman could electrify him like this.

Only Isabella made love feel less like a farce and more like something worth pursuing.

But the crowd was growing unruly.

People pressed closer, desperate to touch the goddess in their midst.

Alexander's smile vanished. He stood, ready to intervene—

Then a cold gust of wind brushed past him.

Nathaniel was already moving, shoving through the throng with single-minded determination.

Alexander's fingers curled into fists, his gaze sharp as a blade. He wanted to tear Nathaniel apart.

Isabella blinked in surprise as Nathaniel appeared before her, shielding her from the encroaching crowd.

"What are you doing?" she asked, voice icy.

"Too many people. You could get hurt," Nathaniel replied casually, still facing away.

"Olivia is right behind me, and The Regal Palace's security is impeccable. They can handle this. You don’t need to play the hero."

She scoffed, unimpressed.

"Isabella, you tricked me again."

Nathaniel finally turned, his gaze heavy, voice low enough for only her to hear.

"Do you have anything to say for yourself?"

A mocking glint lit her eyes. "Bitter about being fooled? Don’t worry—you’ll get used to it."

Nathaniel inhaled sharply, suppressing the urge to cough.

She had infuriated him.

The chaos finally subsided as Olivia dispatched security to restore order.

"Oh my God... you're Alea? How could you be...?"

Adelaide approached, hands covering her mouth, tears welling in her eyes.

"I never hid my identity intentionally. Titles mean nothing to me—I simply love designing jewelry and prefer to stay out of the spotlight." Isabella's tone remained gentle. "I know you admire my work, and I’m honored."

Her grace was breathtaking.

"I'm so sorry, Miss Sinclair—no, Miss Alea. Please forgive my past rudeness!"

Adelaide was consumed by regret, throat tight with shame. Remembering her previous coldness, she wished she could claw her own eyes out.

How could I have been so blind?

"I am Alea, but I’m also the general manager of The Regal Palace. My other identity doesn’t excuse the hotel’s failure in confidentiality. I’ve never blamed you, and you needn’t punish yourself."

At this moment, Isabella was a mirror—forcing Elspeth and her daughter to face their own deceit.

"Whispering Waters Jewels is one of Alea’s rarest private pieces, never displayed publicly. Aside from Alea herself, no one else in the world owns it."

Liva’s piercing gaze locked onto Glynnis. "So there’s no doubt—the necklace Glynnis gifted you is a counterfeit."

"Daring to replicate Alea’s work is a severe violation of her intellectual property. Every piece is heavily insured."

Her voice turned lethal.

"The consequences you’ll face, Glynnis, should be familiar—given your expertise in this field."
###Chapter 231

The room erupted in shocked whispers as Glynnis became the focal point. The dramatic scene felt straight out of a prime-time drama. Thaddeus absorbed the revelation with darkened eyes, his expression eerily composed, as if he'd anticipated this all along.

Getting an audience with Alea was notoriously difficult. The idea that Glynnis could obtain her precious jewelry was laughable. The counterfeit was obvious. Thaddeus' blood boiled as his furious gaze locked onto Evadne again.

Evadne instinctively stepped back under his intense stare. What was that look supposed to mean? Some pathetic attempt to intimidate her?

Glynnis turned ghostly pale under the suspicious stares, clinging to Elspeth like a lifeline.

"Ms. Glynnis," Ada's voice dripped with venom, "was this all an elaborate con? Some cheap trick to manipulate me into working with Abernathy Hotel?"

Glynnis trembled violently, sweat beading on her forehead. Words failed her.

"I trusted you because of the Abernathy name," Ada continued, her voice rising. "Now I question everything about your family. This is hardly befitting Elmsworth's elite!"

Humiliated before her idol, Ada was ready to unleash her fury on Glynnis and the entire Abernathy empire.

The crowd murmured in agreement. A billionaire family gifting a fake to a superstar? And getting caught by Alea herself? The scandal would stain the Abernathy legacy forever, alongside Thaddeus' cheating disgrace.

"Ms. Ada," Thaddeus cut in coldly, "as CEO, I delegated wedding preparations entirely to Glynnis. Her actions reflect solely on herself, not the Abernathy Group."

Evadne's eyebrows shot up in surprise at his ruthless distancing.

Elspeth looked ready to explode.

"However," Thaddeus continued, his gaze deepening as it settled on Evadne, "I will personally compensate President Ashbourne and Ms. Alea for this counterfeit debacle."

The crowd exchanged glances. His words seemed proper, yet carried subtle implications.

Evadne scoffed, turning away. For a moment she'd thought he'd grown a spine, willing to let Glynnis face consequences. But no - he was still cleaning up their messes, still playing the dutiful son.

All his talk about wanting her to win? Empty words.

"Wait!" Elspeth jumped to her feet, face flushed with outrage. "Why are we being treated like criminals? We're victims too! My daughter went through great lengths to acquire this piece, knowing Ada's admiration for Alea's work. The Abernathy fortune could buy ten originals! Why would we risk our reputation with a fake? We demand justice against whoever deceived us!"

The audience rolled their eyes. Claiming they could buy ten Alea pieces? The sheer audacity.

"Elspeth," Liva finally interjected with icy precision, "everyone knows Alea's designs rarely circulate. Owners cherish them forever. Even with all your money, Alea would never sell to you."

She added with biting contempt, "By any measure, you're simply... unworthy."

Elspeth choked on her fury, practically steaming.

The crowd nodded approvingly. Elspeth's reputation in Elmsworth hung by a thread - only her Mrs. Frederic title kept her from being ostracized completely. Someone needed to put this delusional woman in her place.

"And Ms. Glynnis," Liva pivoted sharply, "were you truly deceived... or complicit in this fraud?"

Glynnis ground her teeth. "Of course I was fooled! I can afford the real thing!"

Liva's smirk was razor-sharp. "I wonder."

A ripple of shock passed through the room. There was more?

Thaddeus frowned, his dark eyes shifting to Evadne, who stood quietly beside him. The subtle curve of her lips told him everything. She'd orchestrated this entire spectacle, always three steps ahead, pulling invisible strings.

Her every movement was a gleaming arrow piercing his heart.

"What are you implying?" Elspeth shrieked, clutching Glynnis protectively. "How dare you slander my daughter!"

Liva ignored her, addressing Glynnis directly. "Surely you remember who you commissioned to replicate this necklace?"

Glynnis stayed silent, knowing any answer would be self-incrimination.

"Need a reminder?" Liva signaled, and a man's face appeared on the massive screen.

"Hello, Tyler," Liva greeted.

"Hi Liva. And... Professor." Tyler scratched his head sheepishly, glancing at Evadne.

"Your craftsmanship remains impeccable," Evadne remarked lightly. "I recognized your handiwork immediately."

Glynnis' vision blurred. Without Elspeth's support, she would have collapsed.

Tyler sighed guiltily, then held up a receipt to the camera. "I was commissioned to replicate an Alea piece. Note the signature."

Reporters jostled to zoom in. There, clear as day: "Glynnis Abernathy."

Elspeth's pupils constricted. "What's this?" she hissed. "You said Edith commissioned it!"

"Mom," Glynnis whimpered, tears welling, "Edith set me up!"
###Chapter 232

Elspeth's world spun violently.

The realization hit her like a freight train—her hatred wasn't directed at Evadne anymore. No, it was Edith, that cunning viper who had played her daughter like a puppet.

The room erupted into chaos, voices clashing like thunder.

The truth was undeniable now—Glynnis wasn't the victim. She was the architect of this counterfeit scandal.

Reporters' fingers flew across keyboards, headlines exploding across screens:

BREAKING: Ashbourne Heiress Revealed as Legendary Designer Aleat!

Beauty AND Brains—What Other Secrets Does She Hold?

The Abernathy Group's Glynnis had crossed a line no one dared to. Counterfeiting for a superstar? Who had the audacity? When would Elspeth and her daughter stop their theatrics?

Glynnis stood frozen, her face ashen. In just six months, she'd become the center of another scandal—bigger, uglier than her humiliating press conference apology.

Desperate, Elspeth turned to Thaddeus, her voice dripping with venom. "Thaddeus! As Abernathy Group's president and Glynnis' brother, are you really going to let them tear her apart?"

Her nails dug into her palms. "I may not be your mother, but Glynnis shares your blood! How can you side with an outsider over family?"

Thaddeus' gaze darkened like a storm. "Outsider?"

"Who else?" Elspeth spat, jerking her chin toward Evadne.

Thaddeus glanced at Evadne, his voice cutting. "She doesn't qualify."

Evadne arched a brow. What is this man on about now?

Elspeth's face twisted. "You—you're nothing but a lust-driven fool!"

"Better than a greed-poisoned one."

Thaddeus pulled out his phone, his tone lethal. "Gordon. Bring her in."

Evadne frowned. What game is he playing?

The doors swung open again.

All eyes locked onto Gordon as he wheeled in a masked figure.

"Thaddeus, what the hell?" Evadne hissed, tugging his sleeve.

His Adam's apple bobbed. "I'm returning what's rightfully yours."

Evadne's gaze snapped to the wheelchair.

Then—

The woman lifted a trembling hand and removed her mask.

Caroline Porter.

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

Only Glynnis recoiled as if struck by lightning, her face drained of color.

Evadne's breath caught. She looked from Caroline to Thaddeus, his expression unreadable.

The puzzle pieces clicked.

Caroline had been in an accident—but she wasn't brain-dead.

Thaddeus had orchestrated it all. Let Glynnis think she was safe. Then—boom—shattered her illusions.

Evadne's lips curled. Clever.

"Isn't she that disgraced reporter?" someone muttered.

"The one caught red-handed on live TV!"

"Should've buried herself in shame. Why's she here?"

Caroline inhaled shakily. "I'm here to confess."

Her voice cracked. "I owe President Ashbourne an apology."

She straightened. "I'm Caroline Porter, former reporter for Pioneer Post. I was bribed to steal Ada's wedding designs from someone close to President Ashbourne and sell them to competitors. That breach cost her the Ada collaboration."

The room went still.

Sympathetic eyes turned to Evadne.

With her Aleat revelation, she seemed almost ethereal—too pure for this cutthroat world.

"Who bribed you?" a reporter demanded.

"Was your accident an assassination attempt?"

Caroline's finger shot out, pointing straight at Glynnis.

"She did it!"

Avery's grip tightened around Evadne's waist, his voice low. "Can you walk? Should I call an ambulance?"

She forced a smile. "I won't die today."

Avery—usually ice-cold, untouchable—felt something in his chest splinter. Seeing her like this ignited a protectiveness he'd never known.

"I've got you," he murmured, shielding her as they moved.

"Sir, who are you?" a reporter called.

"Avery Chambers. Chambers Group."

The name sent shockwaves through the room.

Chambers Group? The empire rivaling Abernathy?

Of course. Only men from dynasties like Abernathy or Chambers could stand beside Skyrim's wealthiest woman—now revealed as a design genius.

"Mr. Chambers, are you and Ms. Ashbourne involved?"

"Dating?"

Evadne barely suppressed an eye-roll.

Must everything be romantic? Can't we just be siblings?

Avery's gaze never left her. "I'm Evadne's protector." A beat. "And her suitor."

Evadne's eyes widened.

The room exploded.

Cameras flashed like lightning.

Then—

A figure cut through the chaos, yanking Evadne from Avery's arms.

Thaddeus.

"Let go!" she gasped, pain lancing through her.

He ignored her, his jaw clenched, desperation etched into every line of his body.

The crowd gaped. Who was this? Protector No. 2?

In the hallway, Evadne wrenched free—only for Thaddeus to seize her wrist and pull her flush against him.

"Thaddeus, have you lost your mind?"

His breath came ragged, eyes glistening. "Evadne. What do I have to do?" His voice broke. "What will it take for you to stop pushing me away?"

She scoffed. "You're delusional."

His grip tightened. "Do you think I can't protect you? Or are you trying to humiliate me?"

He'd seen it all—Avery's declaration, the way he'd touched her.

His wife. His love.

Being stolen in broad daylight.

The agony was unbearable.

"One," Evadne counted, her voice glacial.

"Evadne—"

Swish.

A blade flashed, its tip hovering over his heart.
###Chapter 233

The auction ended in a whirlwind of chaos and revelations.

It wasn’t just the staggering charity sum raised by Vogue Paris that night. The journalists were having a field day, uncovering scandal after scandal.

Nathaniel Prescott wasted no time. He sent his secretary and lawyer to the scene immediately. They escorted Victoria Sterling and the trembling Amelia Prescott through the crowd, shielding them from the prying eyes and whispered accusations.

Their exit could only be described as a hasty retreat.

"Miss Isabella, if you can’t provide concrete evidence for your public accusation that Miss Amelia bribed you to steal The Regal Palace’s confidential information, we will sue you for defamation. And we won’t back down." The lawyer’s voice was sharp, a clear warning before he turned away.

Isabella Sinclair felt a chill run down her spine. Facing a lawsuit from the powerful Prescott Group was terrifying enough. But what truly unsettled her was Alexander Kingsley’s presence—cold, unreadable, and utterly ruthless.

He stood there, arms crossed, his piercing gaze fixed on her.

She swallowed hard but forced herself to speak. "I wouldn’t have said it if I didn’t have proof. Don’t think your wealth and power intimidate me!" She lifted her chin. "I’ve changed. I won’t be manipulated into doing something unethical ever again."

"Mr. Kingsley, how should we proceed?" The lawyer hesitated, glancing at Alexander.

His expression remained icy. "Tell Mr. Prescott his opponent isn’t Miss Isabella. It’s The Regal Palace."

A pause.

"And me."

The lawyer stiffened.

Isabella Sinclair was the Ashbourne heiress. If this escalated, they’d be provoking the entire Ashbourne Group—Chairman Emeric, CEO Cassius, and the influential Bright family.

This wasn’t just a scandal. It was a hornet’s nest.

"Apologize when you’re wrong. Take responsibility when you must. Covering for lies only makes you a fool." Alexander’s lips curled in disdain before he turned, scanning the room for Evadne.

But she was already gone.

Again, his warmth was met with cold emptiness.

Iris had another engagement. Evadne walked her to the underground parking lot.

"Miss Evadne, you were magnificent tonight."

Iris pulled her into a warm embrace. "I knew Cassius’ sister wouldn’t disappoint."

Evadne smiled faintly. "You only say that because I’m his sister."

"No." Iris shook her head. "From the moment we met, I admired your grace, your intellect, your strength. I think we could be wonderful friends."

Evadne’s eyes twinkled. "Why stop at friends? How about family?"

Iris flushed. "Darling, I’ll be fifty next year. As much as I adore Cassius, I can’t hold him back."

"What’s wrong with fifty?" Evadne laughed. "My father and his wife, Myra, have a twenty-five-year age gap. They’re happier than ever." She gave Iris a firm pat on the shoulder. "Life’s too short for regrets. If you love him, fight for him. Even if it doesn’t work out, at least you tried."

Iris hesitated. "Evadne… have you ever made choices you regretted?"

The question struck like a blade.

A shadow flickered in Evadne’s eyes, but she kept her smile steady. "Yes. I’ve made mistakes. But I don’t regret them."

She regretted marrying Alexander.

Yet she didn’t regret loving him.

A contradiction, but the truth.

After Iris left, reporters swarmed Evadne. Without her bodyguard Jason, she felt cornered despite their lack of malice.

"Miss Evadne! Will you sue Amelia for copying your designs?"

"Amelia conspired to leak The Regal Palace’s secrets, sabotaging your deal with Ada. Will K Group take legal action?"

"Ada has cut ties with the Prescott Group. Will you reconcile?"

Exhaustion weighed on her. The pain in her stomach flared, sweat beading on her forehead. But she stood tall, her gaze unwavering.

Before she could respond, a familiar voice cut through the chaos.

"All questions will be addressed in K Group’s official statement."

A strong arm wrapped around her waist.

"Miss Evadne isn’t well. Move aside."

She looked up, stunned.

Avery Lockwood’s worried face filled her vision.

He hadn’t been by her side all evening. How did he know she was in pain?

Memories flooded back—three years of neglect, of begging for scraps of affection. Even when she miscarried, when she lay weak and asked for water, Alexander had refused.

Love died in the details. Hers had bled out long ago.

Did she regret it? Yes.

But she had chosen this path.

A drop of sweat trailed down her temple. Avery’s grip tightened.

"Are you okay?" His voice was low, urgent.

"No." Her breath hitched. The pain sharpened with every word.
###Chapter 234

A shiver ran down Thaddeus's spine, his chest tightening with disbelief.

They had once been lovers. Now, she stood against him, blade in hand, ready to strike.

Her knife hadn't pierced his skin yet, but it had already carved into his heart.

"The last man who crossed me was Jareth," Evadne said, tilting her head, her cold eyes devoid of emotion. "He had the sense to stay away after that. I hope I won't need to drive this blade through your heart to make you understand, will I?"

Thaddeus ignored the threat, his voice rough. "What does he have that I don't?"

She blinked, momentarily caught off guard.

"Avery—what makes him so special?" Thaddeus stepped closer, his eyes burning red.

He knew the knife pressed against his chest. He knew how ruthless she could be. But none of it mattered anymore.

"Thaddeus, back off!"

Evadne retreated, but her grip on the knife didn't waver. "Do you really think I won't hurt you?"

"Why him?" His voice cracked. "Is this revenge?"

The blade pricked through his suit, grazing his skin. He barely flinched.

"Should I have chosen you instead?" She scoffed. "And why are you so angry? I loved you once. For three years. Wasn’t it you who pushed me away?"

Every word twisted deeper into his chest.

Thaddeus exhaled sharply, pain radiating through every nerve.

The truth was brutal. Undeniable.

"Evadne."

She turned at the sound of her name. Avery stood a few steps away, concern etched across his face. "You're not well. Let's get you to the hospital."

Unlike Thaddeus, he didn’t engage in petty games.

He cared. He understood.

He wanted her to see who truly valued her.

"Fine. One minute."

Evadne sheathed the knife and walked toward Avery without a backward glance. The choice was clear.

Thaddeus stood frozen, abandoned.

When she reached Avery, she didn’t take his hand, but her voice softened. "Let’s go."

Avery’s fingers twitched before he withdrew them. "Okay."

Side by side, they left, the perfect pair under Thaddeus’s hollow gaze.

Only when they were gone did he press a hand to his chest, where the wound burned deeper than flesh.

"Evadne… I just wanted you to see me."

Avery rushed her to the hospital.

By the time they arrived, she was doubled over in pain, too weak to step out of the car. Her face was pale, fingers clutching her stomach.

Years as a doctor in war zones had left her with chronic pain—endless hunger, exhaustion, and stress.

"Mr. Chambers! I'll get a wheelchair!" the secretary offered, sweating.

"No need."

Avery scooped her into his arms and carried her inside.

"It hurts," she gasped against his shoulder.

"Last time, you scolded me for holding you without permission," he murmured, tightening his grip as if to fuse her to his chest. "But I had no choice. You won’t be angry, will you?"

His voice was velvet, coaxing.

The secretary gaped. Since when did the ruthless Mr. Chambers speak so tenderly to a woman?

If Ms. Evadne doesn’t marry him, the world has no justice.

After being put on an IV, Evadne finally slept.

Maybe it was their childhood bond. Maybe exhaustion lowered her guard. Either way, she allowed him to stay.

The room was silent except for her steady breaths.

Avery didn’t move from her bedside.

Then she shifted, a soft whimper escaping her lips.

His pulse jumped.

Over the years, countless women had thrown themselves at him—in Elmsworth, in Helgen.

The more they tried, the less he cared. Most were as irritating as barnacles on a ship’s hull.

Only Evadne could do as she pleased.

No matter how reckless, how infuriating, he’d always indulge her.

His fingers hovered over her cheek—

His phone buzzed. A message from his secretary:

Mr. Chambers, Ms. Evadne’s family is here. They’re at the door.

Avery adjusted his glasses and opened the ward door.

Cassius, Arnold, and Jason stood like three glaciers in the hall.

"President Ashbourne." Avery spoke first. "Evadne had a sudden attack. I brought her here immediately. My apologies for not notifying you sooner."

Jason’s lips thinned. This man had the audacity to take her without a word?

"Mr. Avery, you—"

Cassius raised a hand, silencing him.

"Thank you for bringing her," Cassius said, his smile razor-thin. "But while we were searching for our sister, you ignored our calls. Then turned off your phone. Care to explain?"

Arnold’s jaw clenched.

This bastard had hidden their sister from them.

Did he think they had nothing better to do?

Avery remained composed. "I was focused solely on Evadne’s well-being. I didn’t want to disturb her rest. It was… an oversight."

"An oversight?" Arnold snapped. "Are you implying we don’t care about her?"

"Of course you do." Avery’s tone was calm. "But surely you wouldn’t deny another man the right to love and cherish her as well?"

Arnold and Jason stiffened.

This was a direct declaration—right to their faces.

Even in the Ashbourne family, no one was this brazen with their feelings.

Cassius’s gaze darkened.

Their father had been right to oppose this man.

Beneath the polished exterior was something unsettling.

"You wait here. I’ll take Evadne home." Cassius turned toward the room. "Mr. Avery, we’ll handle things from here. You may leave."

Avery smiled, unbothered.

His secretary fumed as they walked away. "Sir, they disrespected you! After all you’ve done—"

"Brothers are protective. It’s natural." Avery adjusted his cuffs. "I’m not marrying them. I’m marrying Evadne. Their opinion means nothing."

"But in Helgen, you were—"

"What’s the point of Helgen without her?" His voice turned icy. "I was meant to rule, not rot in obscurity. The Chambers Group should have been mine. Evadne should have been mine long ago."

His eyes burned with quiet madness.

The secretary bowed his head.

"I’ll reclaim everything," Avery whispered. "The company. Her. All of it."
###Chapter 235

Isabella Sinclair blinked awake to find herself back in her family's penthouse in Manhattan.

"Wait—how did I get here?"

She pinched her arm hard to confirm she wasn't dreaming. The sharp pain proved this was reality.

"Either I teleported or grew wings overnight," she muttered.

The door swung open to reveal her adoptive mothers Olivia Bennett and Sophia Reynolds. Sophia immediately rushed to her bedside. "Sweetheart, how's your stomach? Still hurting?"

Olivia gently cupped Isabella's face, concern etching her features. "You've lost weight. Have you been skipping meals again at that office?"

"You should just stay home with us," Sophia added, eyes glistening. "You're the Sinclair heiress—why bother with those corporate sharks? If you want anything, just name it. Even if it's endangered species, I'll hunt them down myself."

Isabella laughed. "Sophia, I'm not that spoiled. Though I might draw the line at crocodile tartare."

"Don't mind her," Olivia chided affectionately. "She just worries about you. We promised your biological mother we'd protect you. Seeing you suffer breaks our hearts."

"It's just indigestion," Isabella waved off their concern. "You're overreacting."

"Overreacting?" Sophia gasped dramatically. "When you were six, we called an ambulance for a sneeze!"

Olivia sighed. "Your father hasn't slept or eaten since you collapsed. He's been pacing outside your door all night."

"What? That's unacceptable!" Isabella bolted upright. "I'll shove food down his throat if I have to!"

Then she paused. "Wait—how did I get home last night?"

"Alexander brought you," Olivia answered.

Ah, her ever-dependable older brother.

Sophia frowned. "But he looked furious when he carried you in. I've never seen him that angry. What did you do?"

Isabella shuddered. "Me? Challenge Alexander? I'm all bark outside but a scared kitten at home—you know that."

The mothers exchanged knowing glances. "So someone else provoked him."

Rubbing her temples, Isabella slid out of bed. "Never mind that. I need to check on William."

In his study, William Sinclair sat brooding on his leather couch, face stormy.

Memories of last night haunted him—seeing his daughter carried home pale and trembling had felt like a knife to his heart.

"Mr. Kingsley," his assistant Richard Langley attempted to lighten the mood, "have you seen today's headlines? The internet's calling Miss Isabella a visionary genius."

"Genius? More like a tornado in human form!" William slammed his fist on the armrest. "Is it too much to ask for one normal day where she doesn't start corporate wars?"

His wife Miranda Chen blinked. "William...you knew Isabella was the anonymous designer Alea all along?"

"She's my daughter—of course I knew! Except about that damned marriage to Nathaniel Vanderbilt!"

William's face reddened as he smacked his thigh in frustration. The little girl he'd once bottle-fed was now a force of nature beyond his control.

"You should be proud," Miranda said softly. "Even the Queen of England wears her designs. That's an incredible honor."

"Miranda, I don't deny her talent," William groaned, massaging his temples. "But she's reckless! Making enemies left and right in that corporate jungle. What if someone sets a trap? By the time I intervene, it might be too late!"

The door burst open to reveal Isabella, cheeks flushed with health.

"Who's the naughty one skipping meals? Should I auction off your vintage car collection to fund orphanages?"

"Are you still in pain?" Miranda fretted.

"Fit as a fiddle," Isabella assured her.

"Then I'll prepare snacks." Miranda shot William a warning look before exiting.

Richard discreetly followed suit.

"I heard everything, Dad." Isabella plopped beside him, draping an arm around his shoulders. "You underestimate me. I don't pick fights I can't win. Those socialites are lambs to my wolf."

"But must you provoke them?" William sighed. "You've got me monitoring stock prices like a hawk."

"Lambs? More like the Vanderbilt clan," Isabella giggled, her laugh like wind chimes. "Dad, your wit's sharper than mine. I admit I was harsh earlier."

"You reckless girl," William pulled her close, then frowned. "Has that Vanderbilt CEO Nathaniel given you trouble?"

Isabella shook her head. "Quite the opposite—he secretly helped that reporter expose Glynnis."

"Playing both sides to clean up his mess," William mused. "No wonder he's kept that CEO chair so long. You were married to him three years—lucky he didn't outmaneuver you."

"Dad, no one outplays me," Isabella flashed a lioness grin.

William's phone buzzed. Isabella glanced at the screen—her smile vanished.

"Who is it?"

"Charles Vanderbilt."

"Ah, your ex-father-in-law."

"Dad!" Isabella's cheeks burned—a rare show of irritation.

William chuckled and put it on speaker. "To what do I owe this call, Charles?"

"William...about last night's auction..." Charles's usually arrogant voice was uncharacteristically meek. "Perhaps we could meet? I'll come to Manhattan—just a quick coffee..."

"I recall no business between us," William said lightly, stroking Isabella's hair. "Besides, my daughter's home. If you have something to say, say it now."

Charles hesitated. "That unsigned receipt...without Glynnis's signature, it's legally void—"

"Charles," William's voice turned glacial, "for your daughter plagiarizing mine, let our lawyers discuss this."

"You'd really sue over this?" Charles's panic surfaced.

William's expression darkened. "Anything concerning my daughter is never 'just business.'"

Isabella watched, eyes shining. Now she understood why her mother married this man—his protective fury was breathtaking.

"William, must we escalate this?" Charles's voice hardened.

"The older I get," William said icily, "the less patience I have for those who harm my family. Cross my daughter, and you'll regret it."
###Chapter 236

The entire city was buzzing about Glynnis Abernathy again.

And as usual, it wasn’t for anything good.

She had single-handedly wiped billions off the Abernathy Group’s stock value in one day.

A record-breaking disaster.

That same night, Ada publicly announced the termination of her collaboration with Abernathy Hotel.

By morning, the scandal had exploded.

The Abernathy stocks kept plummeting.

Online, the backlash against Glynnis was relentless.

"Some heiresses are born with grace. Others? Well, let’s just say they’re not even fit to be compared to poultry. Take Ms. Evadne—beautiful, kind, brilliant. She runs hotels, designs jewelry. A true gem."

"Then there’s Glynnis. Scheming, deceitful, rotten to the core. Ada’s first visit to Elmsworth was a complete humiliation!"

"Stop comparing Ms. Alea to Glynnis. It’s an insult!"

"Honestly, did anyone expect better from Glynnis? Like mother, like daughter."

"Is there a single decent person left in the Abernathy family? Shouldn’t the authorities investigate this circus?"

Three days after the scandal broke, Thaddeus called an emergency board meeting.

Frederic wasn’t even informed.

Glynnis’ seat remained empty.

She had been "sick" for days—too ashamed to show her face.

Thaddeus leaned forward, his piercing gaze sweeping the room.

"Let’s not waste time. By now, everyone knows what happened at K Hotel’s charity event."

Silence.

No one dared to disagree.

"On behalf of the Abernathy Group, I’ll announce the decision."

He nodded at Gordon, who immediately produced a document.

"Effective immediately, Glynnis Abernathy is stripped of her board position. All hotel project rights are revoked. She will fully cooperate with the police investigation."

"The damages caused by her misconduct are her personal responsibility. The Abernathy Group will not provide any legal or financial support."

The room erupted.

Glynnis was Frederic’s daughter. Thaddeus’ half-sister.

This wasn’t just punishment—it was a public execution.

"I won’t accept this!"

Elspeth stormed in, dripping with diamonds and fury.

Thaddeus didn’t even blink.

"Gordon. Remove the uninvited guest."

"Yes, sir."

Gordon stepped forward, blocking Elspeth.

"Ma’am, this is a private meeting. You need to leave."

"How dare you!"

She grabbed his collar, nails digging in.

"I’m the chairman’s wife! This entire company belongs to the Abernathy family! Who are you to throw me out?"

The executives exchanged glances.

Thaddeus smirked.

"The Abernathy Group doesn’t have a position called ‘Frederic’s wife.’"

Elspeth’s face flushed crimson.

A few stifled laughs escaped.

"The decision stands. It’s already been circulated company-wide."

Thaddeus leaned back, eyes sharp as a blade.

"This isn’t a negotiation, Elspeth. Your opinion is irrelevant."

She staggered back, rage turning her eyes venomous.

How dare he humiliate me like this?!

The executives’ stares grew colder.

"Even as CEO, you can’t unilaterally dismiss a board member!" Elspeth spat. "This should be the chairman’s decision!"

Thaddeus arched a brow.

"Are you suggesting Frederic would condone fraud? Commercial theft? Billions in losses? Just because she’s his daughter?"

His words cut deep.

Elspeth’s spine prickled under the weight of their scrutiny.

"Fairness in business is an illusion. But as long as I’m CEO, I won’t let parasites like Glynnis thrive."

He didn’t curse.

Yet Elspeth felt flayed alive.

The room erupted in applause.

By afternoon, the news had spread.

Elspeth’s tantrum. Glynnis’ dismissal.

Employees gossiped mercilessly.

"Finally! Justice!"

"Justice? More like Thaddeus being a legend. I’m framing his photo on my desk."

"Isn’t this basically disowning his sister?"

"Please. They don’t even share a mother. This is called accountability."

"Good riddance!"

Back in his office, Gordon was practically bouncing.

"Sir! Watching that witch get destroyed was better than a spa day!"

Thaddeus shot him a look.

"Do I stress you out that much?"

"No! I—It was just a metaphor!" Gordon flailed.

"The investigation?"

"Elspeth’s secretary handed everything to the police. Glynnis can’t run."

Thaddeus nodded.

Truthfully, Evadne had orchestrated their downfall.

He’d just… helped.

"Also, Mrs. Abernathy was hospitalized that night. Severe stomach spasms."

Thaddeus’ jaw tightened.

"Should we send flowers? Or—"

"Why?"

His voice was rough.

"She has Avery. Her brothers. She doesn’t need my pity."

Gordon winced.

"Sir… your current favorability with her is in the negatives. If you don’t act now—"

A lethal glare silenced him.

"We’re divorced. It’s over."

Thaddeus turned away, throat burning.

"Some things can’t be fixed."

——

Elspeth returned to Windermere in hysterics.

She collapsed into Frederic’s arms, sobbing.

"How could Thaddeus do this?! Glynnis is his sister! And now—"

Frederic pushed her off, irritated.

"I authorized the dismissal."

Elspeth froze.

"You—what?"

"Did you expect me to ignore fraud? Billions in losses? My credibility as chairman matters!"

"Our daughter matters more!"

Frederic stood abruptly, sending her stumbling.

"Clean up your messes, Elspeth. I’m done covering for her."

The door slammed.

Alone, Elspeth’s tears turned venomous.

"Cynthia… even dead, you haunt me."

Her laughter was unhinged.

"But your precious son? I’ll ruin him."

Meanwhile, the Abernathy estate descended into chaos.
###Chapter 237

Isabella Sinclair lounged lazily on the vintage swing chair in the sun-drenched backyard of the Silveke Harbor estate.

This particular swing had always been her mother's sanctuary—a custom-built gift from her father. Barefoot and carefree, Isabella swayed gently, the afternoon breeze playing with her hair just as it had with her mother's all those years ago.

Her father would often join her mother here, sometimes pushing the swing in comfortable silence, other times simply sitting beside her, their hands intertwined as they watched the world pass by.

After her mother's passing, her father, William, insisted the swing be cleaned daily. As if preserving it might somehow bring her back.

"Miss Isabella, Vanessa has officially pledged her loyalty to us," Olivia Bennett murmured, giving the swing a gentle push. "She's requested the honor of hosting an apology dinner for you."

Isabella took a crisp bite of her apple. "Perfect opportunity for you to brush up on your Italian."

"Always with the jokes." Olivia chuckled, her gaze lingering on Isabella's lips—more tempting than the fruit she was eating.

"In the past, I might've accepted out of politeness," Isabella mused between bites. "But now? As her so-called idol, I can't make it that easy for her."

She swung lightly, the chains creaking. "Miracles lose their magic if they happen too often."

"Exactly." Olivia's voice turned sharp. "After how Vanessa treated you, she deserves to sweat a little. Let her understand the cost of crossing you."

"Not about revenge." Isabella stretched, yawning. "Just exhausted from socializing lately. Besides..." She smirked. "We already got what we needed from her."

Vanessa's earlier betrayal had backfired spectacularly—a self-inflicted wound.

The sudden ring of an unknown number made her hesitate. She answered.

"Hello, is this Natalie Waverley?"

Her breath hitched. That name—unheard for years—sent a jolt through her.

"Yes, this is Natalie."

"Ms. Natalie, this is Sean from Misty Mountain National Park. I'm the new head ranger—Professor Leo's protégé."

Misty Mountain. The name transported her thirteen years back. To the place where she'd first met Alexander Kingsley. Where he'd saved her life.

"Professor Leo's student?" Her voice softened. "Did he retire from rangering?"

"Next month marks his final patrol." Sean's tone grew somber. "The pancreatic cancer... We don't know how much time he has left."

"What? Professor Leo—" Isabella bolted upright, the apple forgotten.

"I understand." Her grip tightened on the phone. "I'll visit him soon."

Hanging up, she sat frozen, unshed tears burning.

"Miss Isabella?" Olivia knelt before her, offering a handkerchief. "Who is Professor Leo? What's wrong?"

"An old friend." The forced smile cracked. "Olivia, contact the top gastroenterologists in New York and Seattle. I need the best for him."

"Consider it done." No further questions. Just unwavering loyalty.

Another call interrupted—her bubbly apprentice, Camille.

"Master!" Camille's shriek could've shattered glass. "You—you deceitful woman! The audacity to hide your identity from me! This is emotional fraud! I'm reporting you!"

"Took you long enough." Isabella dabbed her eyes, laughing wetly. "Maybe I should get a perm to match my villainous persona."

Meanwhile, Arabella Vanderbilt reached her breaking point. After Alexander's public rejection and Harrison's cold dismissal, her carefully crafted "gracious lady" facade crumbled.

Fuming, she stormed toward the Fairhaven mansion, dragging her weeping daughter Genevieve.

"Useless girl!" Arabella's manicured nail jabbed Genevieve's forehead, leaving a red mark. "Riding Acacia's coattails? Pathetic! If not for me, your grandfather would've disowned you after that birthday disaster!"

"Daddy loves me! He'd never—"

The slap echoed. "Respect your elders!" Arabella hissed.

Genevieve recoiled, resentment boiling beneath the tears.

"Running with Edith? That viper's playing you for a fool!" Arabella's voice turned venomous. "At least your sister has potential. You? A stepping stone for Isabella!"

The grand Fairhaven doors swung open under Arabella's wrath. Servants whispered:

"Did the young master compromise Miss Vanderbilt?"

"Pregnant, perhaps?"

"Nonsense! He never brings scandals home."

Genevieve burned with humiliation, silenced by her mother's theatrics. "Where is Mrs. Jareth? I demand justice!" Arabella bellowed.

"Madam is indisposed," the butler attempted.

"Lies! My daughter was framed by your precious Edith! No apology? This is Fairhaven's true colors!"

Mrs. Jareth descended the staircase, Edith beside her. Her calm authority dwarfed Arabella's rage.

"Arabella, this isn't a marketplace. Control yourself."

Genevieve shriveled—her future mother-in-law witnessing this disgrace.

"Don't deflect!" Arabella scoffed. "Your daughter forged Genevieve's signature on counterfeit Alea jewelry receipts! If this is Fairhaven's integrity, I'm disgusted!"
###Chapter 238

The Fairhaven household staff gasped in unison, hands flying to cover their mouths in shock.

This woman—Elspeth—daring to ride on the Abernathy chairman's favor, was she trying to stir up a scandal within the Fairhaven family?

Every eye in the room turned toward Edith, including a stunned Mrs. Jareth.

"Edith," Mrs. Jareth demanded, voice trembling, "is what Elspeth saying true?"

Edith's face instantly morphed into an expression of wounded innocence. She bit her lip, her voice dripping with feigned hurt. "Mummy, I would never do such a thing! The whole idea of forging jewelry to win over Ada was Glynnis's scheme!"

Glynnis's face twisted in fury. She lunged forward, finger jabbing accusingly. "Edith, stop lying! It was your plan from the start—using me to tarnish Evadne's reputation by replicating Alea's jewelry!"

"Evadne?" Mrs. Jareth's eyes widened. "The Ashbourne heiress? What does she have to do with this?"

Edith's throat tightened, a bead of sweat sliding down her temple.

This idiot Glynnis. She’d dragged Evadne into it. There was no turning back now.

"Elspeth," a cold voice cut through the chaos like a blade, "do you think this is a street market where you can screech like a banshee?"

Jareth strode in, his presence commanding silence. His smirk was sharp, his gaze sharper.

"Your petty squabbles mean nothing, but don’t you dare drag the Fairhaven name through the mud."

"Mr. Jareth!" The staff bowed in unison.

"Jareth!" Edith’s eyes welled with crocodile tears as she rushed to him, clinging to his arm.

Jareth had always despised Glynnis. He’d doted on Edith since childhood. Surely he’d take her side without question.

"Mr. Jareth!" Elspeth bristled. "You and Thaddeus are like brothers. Our families are connected. How dare you speak to me, your elder, with such disrespect?"

"My friendship with Thad is between us," Jareth drawled, tilting his head mockingly. "What does that have to do with you, Elspeth? You didn’t raise him."

His smile turned razor-thin. "You’ve never shown him kindness, yet now you wield his name like a shield. Do you think I’m fooled?"

Elspeth recoiled.

The Jareth before her now was nothing like the polite young man she’d seen at the Abernathy estate. Here, his disdain was laid bare.

Was Frederic’s favor the only thing keeping her afloat? Without it, was she nothing in the eyes of these young wolves?

A chill slithered down her spine.

For over two decades, she’d had everything—except basic respect.

"Jareth!" Edith wailed, pressing herself against him. "Glynnis is framing me! She got herself into trouble and now she’s dragging me down with her!"

Her fingers dug into his sleeve. "I know I was wrong! You warned me about her, but I didn’t listen. Now I’m paying the price. I’ll never disobey you again!"

Jareth’s gaze darkened. "Edith," he said slowly, "is Glynnis telling the truth?"

His voice was dangerously calm. "Were you the one who orchestrated the counterfeit jewelry to frame Evadne?"

"No!" Edith’s face paled. "It was all Glynnis!"

"Liar!" Glynnis snarled, stepping forward. "The forger was Alea’s apprentice—from Aetheria! I don’t have connections there, but you do! You studied abroad there!"

Her eyes burned with fury. "If you won’t admit it, I’ll bring Tyler here and make you face him!"

"Face him?" Edith scoffed. "You’ve probably bribed him already! This is just another one of your traps!"

The argument spiraled, accusations flying like daggers.

"Ms. Edith," Elspeth cut in, smirking, "your plan was quite clever—using my daughter to attack Evadne, all while keeping your hands clean. If it worked, you benefited. If it failed, Glynnis took the fall."

She tilted her head. "Too bad Evadne turned out to be Alea herself. Your scheme crumbled."

Edith’s face flushed crimson. "Elspeth! I respected you as an elder. How dare you slander me?"

"Edith," Mrs. Jareth whispered, horrified, "did you really plot against Evadne?"

The shock made her sway, her grip on the banister the only thing keeping her upright.

"Mom! Jareth!" Edith stomped her foot, reverting to childhood theatrics. "Why would I target Evadne? I have no reason!"

In the past, this act had always worked. Jareth would relent, smoothing things over.

But now, his expression remained unreadable.

Glynnis snorted. "No reason? You’re obsessed with Thad! You can’t stand that he still cares for Evadne!"

Elspeth smirked, twisting the knife. "And let’s not forget—Evadne isn’t just important to Thaddeus. Mr. Jareth once pursued her too."

Her gaze slid to Jareth. "A man of honor wouldn’t let anyone harm a woman he once cherished, would he?"

Edith trembled, fists clenched. "Jareth! Don’t listen to them! I like Thad, but they’re divorced! Why would I—"

Jareth’s face darkened like a gathering storm.

Before he could speak, his secretary, Lily, rushed in.

"Mr. Jareth," she said urgently, "the police are here."

Her eyes flicked to Glynnis. "They must have tracked her from the Abernathy estate."

Glynnis’s legs buckled.

Elspeth’s grip on her daughter’s arm turned vice-like.

"Miss Glynnis!"

Two officers strode in, their voices cutting through the tension. "You’re under investigation for leaking K Orld Hotel’s business secrets. Come with us."
###Chapter 239

The world around Glynnis spun violently, her ears filled with a deafening buzz as if struck by lightning. She stood frozen, unable to move.

"Mom, save me! Mom!"

Watching her daughter being dragged away by the police, Elspeth abandoned all pretense of aristocratic dignity. She even attempted to physically block the officers. "My daughter is innocent! How can you, as law enforcement, handle a case so carelessly? How dare you arrest an innocent person?!"

Jareth observed the dramatic mother-daughter duo with icy detachment, silently willing the police to hurry and remove them from his sight. "Elspeth, if you don’t step aside, we’ll charge you with obstruction of justice!" The officer’s tone was sharp, unyielding.

"My daughter was set up! By her—by the Fairhaven family’s daughter, Edith!" Elspeth shrieked, her voice trembling with fury and fear, her venomous glare locked onto Edith.

"What does this have to do with me? Even if I forged the name, it’s just a copyright issue. A little compensation and it’s settled. But I had nothing to do with leaking trade secrets!"

Edith’s words caught in her throat as her heart lurched painfully. She slapped a hand over her mouth.

Damn it. She’d slipped up. In her haste to distance herself from Glynnis, she’d accidentally confessed to the forgery.

She felt exposed, as if sharp arrows had pierced her chest.

Slowly, she turned to meet Jareth’s gaze—filled with rage, shock, and crushing disappointment.

"Mr. Jareth! Your sister isn’t as innocent as you think! She’s deceitful, and she’s lied to both of us!"

Glynnis’s shrill scream echoed through the Fairhaven estate, chilling as a banshee’s wail. "Edith! You used me as your scapegoat. I’ll never forgive you—just you wait!"

"Edith! Come here, now!" Mrs. Jareth called, visibly shaken by Elspeth and her daughter’s theatrics.

"Mummy!"

Still reeling, Edith tried to run to her mother, but Jareth seized her wrist, stopping her in her tracks.

"Jareth." Her voice trembled.

"Edith, why did you do it? Was it to get back at Ms. Evadne?" Jareth’s eyes burned red with fury.

"It’s all Glynnis’s lies!"

"You’re still denying it!"

Jareth roared, tightening his grip until Edith cried out in pain. "Ouch, Jareth, let go! It hurts! Mummy, help me!"

"Jareth! Release her this instant! Are you trying to break your sister’s wrist?"

Mrs. Jareth rushed forward in a panic, prying Jareth’s fingers open and pulling Edith protectively into her arms. "Can’t we discuss this calmly?"

"Discuss? I gave her a chance to explain, and what was she doing?"

Jareth’s fury was palpable, his gaze locked onto Edith’s tear-streaked face—still angelic, still innocent.

A sharp ache radiated through his chest. "She conspired with Glynnis to frame Ms. Evadne! What did Evadne ever do to deserve this? Because she’s Thaddeus’s ex-wife? Is that your petty reason?"

"Enough, Jareth! You’ve watched Edith grow up. Don’t you know how kind-hearted she is?"

Mrs. Jareth cradled her trembling daughter. "Even if Edith made a mistake, it’s because that Abernathy girl manipulated her! How can you accuse your own sister? If this gets out, Edith will be ruined!"

"She flew to Aetheria on a private jet before Glynnis and Ada’s contract signing. When I asked where she was going, she lied about attending a fashion show. If you’re truly innocent, why lie?"

Jareth’s voice was thunderous. "You already admitted to forging the name. How can you deny it now? If Father knew how low you’ve sunk, he’d turn in his grave!"

"Jareth! How dare you speak to your sister like this!" Mrs. Jareth’s eyes welled with tears at the mention of her late husband.

"Jareth! You bastard!" Edith was flushed with humiliation and rage, drowning in fear and indignation. "Evadne humiliated me in front of Thaddeus and everyone else! What’s wrong with giving her a taste of her own medicine? You’re so self-righteous now, defending her! You only care about that woman—I’m nothing to you! But no matter how much you grovel, Evadne will never love you. You’re just a pathetic fool!"

"Edith!"

Jareth’s crimson eyes bore into her. The sheer intensity of his voice made her shrink back into her mother’s embrace.

"Even if Evadne couldn’t be your sister-in-law, she doesn’t deserve your malice. And I know her character. She’s stubborn, ruthless, and vengeful—but she’d never attack anyone unprovoked. If what you say is true, you started this feud!"

Edith was so furious she could spit blood.

"One more thing—give up on Thaddeus. He loves Evadne. Anyone with eyes can see it, except him." Jareth smirked.

Edith’s face burned crimson, bile rising in her throat.

"Tomorrow, you’re apologizing to Ms. Evadne. Face to face."

Jareth issued the command coldly before turning to leave.

"Jareth! Have you lost your mind? I won’t apologize to Evadne! Never!" Edith screamed hysterically.

"If you don’t, I’ll send you back to Aetheria tonight. Without my permission, you won’t set foot in Elmsworth again!"

Jareth’s resolve was unshakable, leaving even Mrs. Jareth stunned. She’d heard rumors of her son’s ruthlessness, but when had he become so cold toward his own sister?

All for Thaddeus’s ex-wife, Evadne?

"Jareth, come back!"

Edith’s voice was hoarse from screaming, but Jareth—who had always doted on her—didn’t even glance back.

Midnight, Sapphire Nights Club

Jareth sat alone in the VIP room, downing shot after shot.

The accusations against Edith gnawed at him, his heart pounding painfully. The alcohol churned in his stomach, a fire burning inside him.

The door creaked open.

"Get out! I don’t want company!"

Irritated, Jareth hurled his glass to the floor, shattering it.

"Mr. Jareth, it’s Mr. Thaddeus."

Lily offered an apologetic smile, stepping aside to reveal Thaddeus. "Apologies, Mr. Thaddeus. Mr. Jareth isn’t in the best mood tonight."

"I’m used to it." Thaddeus’s expression was unreadable.

"Please, come in."

Thaddeus nodded and entered.

Lily bowed and shut the door behind him.

"What’s wrong with you?"

Thaddeus frowned, taking a seat beside Jareth. "Didn’t Evadne reject you already? Why the theatrics?"

"You think it’s funny I got rejected?" Jareth grabbed the bottle, gulping directly from it.

"Rejected? You don’t even qualify for that term."

Thaddeus lit a cigarette, exhaling smoke. "Evadne never accepted you in the first place. At best, you were a backup."

"Damn it. If I’m a backup, you’re a flat tire—useless dead weight. Even a Ferrari wouldn’t move with you on board!"

The moment the words left his mouth, Jareth remembered Edith calling Evadne a "slut," and his chest constricted. His eyes reddened as he smashed another bottle.

If it were anyone else, he’d have already struck them down.

But the one who insulted Evadne was his beloved sister. No matter how furious he was, he couldn’t lay a hand on her. He couldn’t even bring himself to punish her harshly.

Thaddeus flicked ash from his cigarette, his gaze turning frosty. "You’re not yourself. What happened?"

Jareth exhaled heavily. "The forged name Glynnis used to bribe Ada? It was Edith’s work."

Thaddeus’s pupils contracted slightly, but he remained silent.

"You’re not surprised?"

"I suspected as much."

Jareth’s stomach twisted. "Thad, about my sister—"

"Since we’re on the subject, there’s more."

Thaddeus blew out smoke, his aura icy. "The person who hired reporters to attack Evadne at the charity event? Also your sister."

Jareth paled, as if sinking into quicksand.

After a long pause, he stammered, "Thad, I’m sorry."

"The one who should apologize isn’t you. It’s your sister. And she should apologize to my ex-wife."

The word "ex-wife" stabbed through Jareth’s chest.

"Edith is twenty-two. I know ‘young and naive’ isn’t an excuse anymore."

Jareth’s voice was rough. "But you’ve watched her grow up too. She’s spoiled, reckless, acts without thinking—but she’s not evil. Glynnis led her astray. As her brother, I failed to discipline her properly."

Thaddeus was silent for a beat. "So how do you plan to make amends for your sister’s mistakes? How will you compensate Evadne?"

Jareth’s breath hitched.

"Tomorrow, I’ll take Edith to apologize to her."

"That’s it?"

"Thad, she’s still my sister. For my sake, can you let this slide just once?" Jareth pleaded.

"I’ll go with you tomorrow." Thaddeus’s tone was light.

"Why? You think I’d side with Edith and cause trouble for Evadne? I wouldn’t dare."

"No. I’m afraid you’ll get stabbed." Thaddeus stood leisurely.

Jareth’s chest tightened—was this bastard referring to the time Evadne threatened him with a knife? Heartless!

"Anyway, it’s been a while. I want to see how she’s doing."

Thaddeus’s eyes softened slightly as he walked toward the door.

"Thad! You haven’t answered me!"

Jareth called urgently. "For the sake of our twenty-year friendship, let this go just once. I’ll ensure Edith apologizes, and the Fairhaven Group will compensate Evadne for all damages!"

Thaddeus paused. "Jareth, if it were your sister attacked like this, could you swallow your pride?"

Jareth fell silent.

"For our friendship, I’ll spare Edith this once."

Thaddeus glanced back, his fist clenching. The chill around him was suffocating.

"But only this once."
###Chapter 240

For three blissful days, Isabella Sinclair had been indulging in the comforts of home, her routine reduced to eating and sleeping. She was practically a pampered piglet, basking in the luxury of being spoiled rotten.

Her stepmothers couldn’t resist doting on her. Sophia Reynolds took charge of the kitchen, whipping up an endless parade of mouthwatering dishes just for Isabella.

Three days later, she stepped onto the scale—only to discover she’d gained six pounds.

“I’ll turn into an actual pig at this rate!” Isabella groaned, clutching her head in despair.

“Oh, hush now, just one more meal won’t hurt!” Sophia and Victoria Sterling coaxed, guiding her back to the dining table.

With Alexander Kingsley and Daniel Carter away for an important event, lunch was just Isabella and her three stepmothers.

“Miss Isabella! You won’t believe this!” Olivia Bennett burst in, her eyes gleaming with excitement. “Vanessa Wright’s been caught in a business scandal—she’s in police custody! Victoria Sterling’s running around like a headless chicken, and Nathan Prescott’s scrambling to bail his daughter out!”

“Took them three whole days to handle Vanessa. The Elmsworth police could learn a thing or two from our Skyrim guards.” Isabella wasn’t fazed. She merely dabbed her lips with a napkin.

“Well, Vanessa is the heiress of a wealthy family. The police had to tread carefully.”

Sophia slid another pastry onto Isabella’s plate. “Eat up. Once you’re back in Elmsworth, you won’t get Sophia’s cooking anymore.”

“I—I really can’t!” Isabella shook her head, covering her mouth as a tiny burp escaped. Her stepmothers burst into laughter. Watching her adorable antics, Olivia couldn’t help but smile. He moved closer, gently patting her back.

“Miss Isabella, slow down,” he murmured.

Victoria, sharp as ever, caught the tender gesture. She said nothing, but she noted the affection in Olivia’s eyes.

“Sure, Vanessa’s a troublemaker who’s harassed our Isabella one too many times—she deserves what she got. But honestly, Victoria Sterling’s the real snake here! She needs to be locked up and drained of all that venom!” Victoria Sterling slammed her fist on the table. “That woman’s done nothing but make Isabella’s life hell. I know she’s behind everything! She’s worse than a viper!”

With her husband absent, Victoria had thrown all dining etiquette out the window. Sophia, heart racing, stuffed a pineapple pastry into her mouth to shut her up.

Isabella’s expression darkened. Clearly, there was bad blood between Sophia and Victoria Sterling.

After lunch, instead of confronting Sophia directly, Isabella slipped into Victoria’s room for answers.

“Sophia and Victoria Sterling did work together at NexGen Network before she married Alexander. They were both signed under the same agency. But while Sophia was a top actress, Victoria Sterling was always stuck playing the villain in her shows.”

“Knowing Victoria Sterling’s manipulative nature, she must’ve tried sabotaging Sophia’s career, right?” Isabella guessed.

“Exactly! She—” Victoria caught herself. “Oh no, I promised Sophia I wouldn’t tell.”

“Victoria! If Victoria Sterling bullied Sophia, don’t you want revenge?”

“Victoria hates Victoria Sterling. Why else would she quit acting at the peak of her career?”

A cold voice cut through the air, startling them both.

“Lillian, when did you get here?” Isabella gasped, relieved it wasn’t Sophia who’d overheard.

“The moment you two started whispering—if you can even call it that.” Lillian shut the door behind her. “Victoria, there’s no point hiding things now. Isabella’s grown. She deserves to know.”

Isabella grabbed Lillian’s hand, waiting.

“Out of jealousy, Victoria Sterling sabotaged Sophia constantly—spreading rumors, turning the entire network against her. Then, someone drugged her before a major event, nearly destroying her reputation.”

Lillian took a deep breath, forcing herself to stay composed.

“Drugged?” Isabella’s voice cracked. “Did they—?”

“Not that kind of drug,” Lillian clarified quickly. “A banned substance that affects the nervous system. It’s illegal now, but back then, it was common in the industry. A soft drug, but still dangerous.”

Isabella and Victoria paled, their eyes burning with fury.

Of course, Lillian would know—she was the heiress of the Bright family, a pharmaceutical empire.

“What happened next?” Isabella gripped Lillian’s hand tighter.

“At NexGen’s anniversary gala, she wet herself onstage. In front of everyone.”

Lillian’s voice wavered, her eyes glistening.

Victoria smashed her fist into the vanity mirror, shattering it. “That bitch!”

Isabella’s shoulders trembled, her breath hitching.

Twenty years had passed, yet the humiliation still felt raw—the cruel laughter, the shame that had haunted Sophia ever since. Once Hollywood’s darling, she’d been reduced to a laughingstock on the stage she loved most.

“Lillian, how do you know it was Victoria Sterling?” Isabella asked coldly.

“Alexander and I found evidence, but nothing concrete enough to pin it on her. Victoria Sterling bullied Sophia relentlessly, and she was close with the network head. Sophia was trapped in a long-term contract—she had no choice but to endure.” Lillian sighed. “I even confirmed Victoria Sterling’s agent bought that drug around that time. But back then, plenty of performers were using it. We couldn’t prove it was her.”

“That’s enough.”

Isabella closed her eyes. When they opened again, they burned crimson.

“If I believe she’s guilty, that’s all that matters.”
###Chapter 241

The return trip from Skyrim to Elmsworth was unusually subdued. The normally vivacious Isabella Sinclair sat in silence, her striking features shadowed by an uncharacteristic melancholy.

Back at The Regal Palace, she dismissed her loyal assistant Sebastian Lockwood with a curt wave, retreating immediately to her private office. There, she immersed herself in old case files about the infamous scandal involving Victoria Sterling.

"That media gala was Victoria's lowest point," Isabella mused aloud, "yet it became the foundation of her bond with Alexander Kingsley."

"In those days before social media dominated, scandals spread through print. Alexander reportedly bought and destroyed every national publication that covered the incident. He even blacklisted journalists who dared write about it. Rumor has it some foreign press captured footage that leaked online. Despite Alexander's efforts to erase it, fragments survived."

Isabella exhaled sharply, her piercing gaze fixed on the monitor as her fingers flew across the keyboard. Soon, the long-buried video materialized - grainy with age but unmistakable.

The footage showed Victoria trembling under harsh spotlights, her face ghostly pale. The crowd's gasps and cruel laughter echoed as she stood frozen, visibly crumbling. Then, a commanding figure strode onto the stage - Alexander Kingsley in his prime.

Without hesitation, Alexander removed his jacket, knelt before Victoria, and wrapped it around her waist. The room fell silent. The video ended abruptly.

Isabella leaned back, shoulders slumping as she stared at the blank screen.

"So this was the moment that won her heart?" she whispered bitterly. "Alexander, you truly mastered the game."

Her phone's sudden ring startled her. "What is it, Sebastian?" she answered tersely.

"Miss Sinclair, Nathaniel Whitmore is here with his sister."

Still irritated about Victoria, Isabella initially considered refusing them. But hearing Nathaniel came to apologize piqued her interest. Watching the spoiled girl squirm might lift her spirits.

Approaching the meeting room, Sebastian intercepted her with concern. "Miss Sinclair, my apologies - I didn't realize earlier. Dominic Blackwood is also present."

Isabella's glacial stare could have frozen lava. "Why didn't you throw him out?"

Sebastian bowed deeply. "My oversight, Miss Sinclair." Dominic had been absent when Sebastian escorted Nathaniel and Amelia in, yet somehow materialized on the sofa sipping coffee when he returned.

"Never mind," Isabella waved dismissively. "You couldn't have handled him anyway."

With a sharp nod, she signaled Sebastian to open the door.

She entered like a storm - tailored suit, lethal heels, radiating authority that commanded the room.

"Isabella." Nathaniel rose nervously. She remained as mesmerizing and dangerous as ever - the ruthless queen of their world.

Dominic's entire body tensed as he watched her.

Amelia cowered behind Nathaniel, small fists clenched in terror at the formidable woman before them.

"What a gathering," Isabella remarked dryly, shrugging off her jacket which Sebastian caught deftly. She turned to Dominic, lips curling in a mocking smile. "Dominic, here to defend little Amelia's honor?"

Dominic's blood boiled at her taunt. He choked on the retort stuck in his throat.

Isabella's verbal daggers always found their mark with him. Yet this sharp-edged version of her was precisely what captivated him.

Amelia, misunderstanding the tension, hid a smirk and stepped forward with practiced meekness.

"Isabella, I admit my mistakes, but are you going blind?" Dominic countered, gaze locked on hers with hidden intensity. "There's no Dominic here. Only your ex-husband."

Amelia froze as if struck by lightning.

"But I did come to support someone," Dominic continued, his handsome face flushing. He grabbed his coffee cup to hide his expression, burning his tongue on the scalding liquid. "Just not Miss Amelia."

Isabella's eyes narrowed in suspicion.

If not Amelia, then who?

Nathaniel?

Still ultimately about Amelia, wasn't it?
###Chapter 242

The crimson curve of Isabella's lips remained cold, her piercing gaze unbothered—if anything, slightly impatient.

Edith, on the receiving end of that indifference, seethed. Every fiber of her being trembled with barely contained fury.

Nathaniel's blatant favoritism toward his ex-wife was a brutal execution of her pride.

Why?

Why would he choose a woman he'd discarded over her—someone beautiful, intelligent, and from an impeccable family?

And yet, Isabella had men orbiting her constantly. First, there was Jareth, her current lover. Then that unassuming pretty boy, Avery. How many others had there been? Didn’t Nathaniel find that repulsive?

"I heard Mr. Jareth brought you here to apologize to me," Isabella began, her voice glacial. "That’s the only reason I made time for this meeting. You should know—I’m not just Isabella Sinclair anymore. I’m Alea, the world-renowned jewelry designer. People beg for an audience with me. I don’t waste my time on trivial matters or insignificant people."

She flicked her raven hair over one shoulder, crossing her arms as she lounged elegantly on the sofa. "Had I known you’d be here, I wouldn’t have bothered."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened. "Why?" His voice was rough, his chest constricting. "Would you rather see Jareth than me?"

Jareth’s eyebrow twitched. He muttered under his breath about Nathaniel’s audacity. He knew damn well he ranked higher in Isabella’s life than Nathaniel ever would.

"There are only two reasons I meet people—business or personal."

Isabella held up two slender fingers, waving them dismissively in Nathaniel’s direction. "With you, Nathaniel, there’s neither. Why should I entertain someone who means less than a stranger?"

Less than a stranger.

Nathaniel’s expression darkened, a burning ache spreading from his throat to his chest.

Jareth smirked. At least she acknowledged his existence.

"Mr. Jareth," Isabella drawled, crossing her long legs, the red stiletto dangling provocatively. "If you have something to say, say it. I have a meeting soon and no patience for wasted time."

She was like a goddess from myth—regal, untouchable, devastating.

Nathaniel’s gaze involuntarily dropped to the sliver of pale ankle peeking from beneath her trousers. His throat went dry.

This was the woman he’d been foolish enough to let go.

Now, she radiated power. Every strand of her hair, every inch of her skin—flawless.

Edith, meanwhile, played the victim perfectly—her face ghostly pale, lips trembling as if she’d been wronged.

"Isabella—no, President Sinclair," Jareth corrected swiftly, noting the shift in her expression. "We came to apologize. The necklace Glynnis gave to Ada at the auction was a replica my sister sourced from Aetheria."

He watched Isabella carefully, gauging her reaction.

"Oh, I knew that ages ago," she replied, unfazed.

The Fairhaven siblings stiffened.

Nathaniel merely frowned. Of course she’d known. The current Isabella Sinclair had eyes everywhere. Edith’s schemes were child’s play compared to her.

"When did you find out?" Edith demanded, unable to mask her shock.

Isabella smirked. "The day you went to Tyler and paid him a fortune to replicate my design."

Edith’s composure shattered. "What?!"

"Ms. Edith," Isabella tilted her chin up, "you assumed Tyler, as my former apprentice, would betray me for money. That’s where you miscalculated. Just because exes can’t be friends doesn’t mean mentors and protégés can’t."

Nathaniel inhaled sharply.

That stung.

"Tyler may be from Aetheria, but he understands loyalty. He’d never sell me out for petty cash."

Her lips curled into a cold smile. "So from the start, your plan was doomed. You judged others by your own pathetic standards."

The contrast between them was stark—one noble, the other petty.

Nathaniel’s lips twitched, his gaze steady.

Jareth, however, struggled to keep his expression neutral. He’d braced himself for Isabella’s sharp tongue—but damn, it cut deep.

"Isabella! You’re vile!"

Edith pointed accusingly, her voice shrill. "You knew everything and played dumb! You orchestrated Glynnis’s downfall at the auction just to humiliate her! Are you going to destroy anyone who crosses you?"

Tears streamed down her face, as if she were the wronged party.

"Or what?" Isabella rolled her eyes. "Should I keep them around for Christmas dinner?"

Edith choked on her fury.

This woman had no fear. Not of Nathaniel, not of Jareth—no man could intimidate her.

"Ms. Edith," Nathaniel’s voice was steel, "you’re here to apologize, not accuse. Is admitting fault so difficult?"

He met Isabella’s gaze, unwavering. "President Sinclair, even if you don’t punish Glynnis and Edith, I will. The outcome remains the same. Any objections?"

Isabella studied him, a flicker of surprise in her eyes.

So he wasn’t shielding Edith after all.

Not that it mattered.

"Nathaniel!" Edith sobbed, heartbroken and furious.

But the man before her wasn’t the gentle brother who’d once walked her through gardens with a smile.

He was bewitched. Lost to reason.

"Are we done here?" Isabella stood, impatient.

"Edith, apologize. Now," Jareth urged.

"I’m sorry," she gritted out.

"Louder." Isabella arched a brow.

"I’M SORRY!"

Jareth pressed a firm hand to Edith’s back, forcing her into a bow. Humiliation burned through her.

She’d make Isabella pay.

"Jason," Isabella called.

"Yes, Miss Sinclair."

"Mr. Jareth mentioned compensating for Edith’s misconduct. Calculate the damages—copyright infringement, emotional distress, everything. Then let him review the total." She strode toward the door. "Every cent will go to the Elmsworth Foundation. I won’t keep a penny."

Jareth’s smile turned bitter.

Isabella was ethereal—but as untouchable as a winter storm.

Later, in her office, Jason presented Jareth with an astronomical sum.

The price of crossing Alea.

Jareth sighed. It wasn’t the money—it was the blow to his dignity.

He’d genuinely cared for Isabella. Even if romance was impossible, he’d hoped for friendship.

Now, even that seemed out of reach.

Outside, Edith sobbed like a martyr.

"The victim isn’t crying. What right does the culprit have?" Jareth snapped, striding ahead.

"Jareth! She extorted a billion from you! Why not just rob a bank?"

"She’s being merciful," he said coldly. "If not for today’s apology, you’d be humiliated at a press conference."

Edith paled.

"Go home. Reflect. Don’t leave without my permission."

He got into his car, ignoring her screams.

As the vehicle disappeared, Edith collapsed, weeping.

Then—her phone rang.

A private number.

"Who is this?" she hissed.

A distorted male voice replied, "Ms. Edith. Today must have been painful. The man you love won’t even look at you."

Her breath hitched.

"What if I said I could help you win him?"

Her pulse raced.

Who was watching her?

And—more importantly—could she trust him?

Meanwhile, Jason returned to Isabella’s side, mission accomplished.
###Chapter 243

"Miss Isabella, are you seriously going easy on that Ms. Evelyn? This has got to be the most lenient I've ever seen you."

Nathaniel watched as Isabella kicked off her stilettos carelessly, revealing a helpless yet affectionate smile. He neatly arranged them under the table for her.

At the moment, Isabella was furiously playing a video game, wreaking havoc in the digital world.

In this gaming universe, the female warrior queen Cifer had become a goddess adored by players. Every time she live-streamed, hundreds of thousands tuned in—her popularity was staggering.

"What are you thinking, going easy? I'm a businesswoman, not a saint overflowing with mercy. I haven't dealt with Evelyn yet because I lack concrete evidence. She made Genevieve her scapegoat—all the suspicions are circumstantial. There's nothing I can do to her."

"It seems there's deep animosity between you and Ms. Evelyn."

Nathaniel grumbled, "She didn't show an ounce of remorse. When she left, she even glared at you. That look was downright murderous!"

"She'd better be capable of following through, or else she'll be the one humiliated when her schemes backfire."

Her phone buzzed—Alexander was calling.

"Alexander!" Isabella answered immediately, her voice sweet and warm.

"Isabella, are you at the hotel?" Alexander asked.

"Yes, in the office."

"So, is Nathaniel with you?" Alexander lowered his voice.

Isabella, sharp as ever, caught on instantly. She stood and walked toward the door, pretending to head to the restroom.

If she asked Nathaniel to leave now, the perceptive Dominic would surely suspect she was avoiding him.

Once inside the private restroom, she closed the door.

"Alexander, what's going on? Is this about Nathaniel?"

"It doesn’t concern him directly, but there are connections. Since he's with you, I can't speak freely."

Alexander paused, his tone steady. "Mr. Harrison, desperate to free his daughter, sought help from Nathaniel’s lawyer brother, Cedric Lockwood. Cedric has already gone to the police station to get Miss Vanderbilt."

Isabella’s eyes darkened. "With Dominic guarding her, the chances of Genevieve getting out are high."

"Cedric is cunning and experienced—undefeated in his decade-long legal career. He won’t allow failure, even if it means resorting to underhanded tactics to clear Miss Vanderbilt’s name."

Alexander gently reminded her, "Isabella, if I were Cedric, I’d start with Ms. Charlotte. She’s the primary witness against Genevieve."

"Alexander, I understand. But Charlotte isn’t in my hands—she’s under Sebastian’s control."

Isabella took a deep breath, her expression calm. "I’ll handle this. You and Sebastian shouldn’t get involved. Especially Sebastian—he’s a public servant. He can’t break the law for my sake. If someone with ill intentions catches him, it won’t end well."

After hanging up, the weight on her shoulders grew heavier.

As for Genevieve, she had never considered her a real threat. Elspeth was the true queen she needed to dethrone.

But she worried this situation would upset Nathaniel again. That sensitive young man carried too much responsibility—would he end up crying in her arms once more?

With a heavy heart, Isabella walked back toward the office.

"Isabella."

Hearing the deep voice, she froze. Her pulse quickened as she turned sharply.

No one was behind her.

She shook her head, rubbing her temples. Lack of sleep must be playing tricks on her.

"Ah!"

Suddenly, a strong hand gripped her arm, pulling her into the shadows like a vortex.

The next second, she collided with a firm chest. The man’s slightly ragged breath brushed her hair, sending warmth through her body.

The embrace was deep, heavy—both familiar and foreign.

It was Sebastian.

Perhaps because she wore towering heels, he feared she’d twist an ankle. His arms tightened around her waist, the grip firm yet conflicted—protective yet afraid she’d bolt like a startled deer.

"Sebastian! How did you get in here?" Isabella was furious, her cheeks flushed as she struggled.

"Dominic said your security was tight. I knew it’d take effort to reach you." Sebastian’s voice was rough yet casual.

A military academy graduate, evading hotel security was child’s play.

But as CEO, he rarely needed such skills—until he wanted to see Isabella.

"Sneaky! You’re acting like a thief!"

She clenched her teeth, lifting her foot to stomp on his. But Sebastian spun her around, pinning her against the wall.

Their gazes locked, intense and heated.

Sebastian knew seeing her wasn’t easy. His greedy eyes traced her face repeatedly.

"What are you staring at? Haven’t you seen enough?" Isabella snapped, her ears turning red.

"You’ve gained some weight." Sebastian stared without blinking.

Her usually sharp features had softened slightly. He couldn’t help but smirk.

Gained weight?

Gained weight?!

"Are you angry? A little weight isn’t bad. You were too thin before—your waist was all bones. It hurt my hands. You should eat more." Sebastian spoke seriously, as if delivering sage advice.

Isabella’s cheeks burned like the rising sun. She slapped him across the face!

Sebastian’s cheek stung as he gripped her wrist. The slap’s imprint stood out like a brand of shame. "Isabella, is this how you repay someone who helped you?"

"I don’t expect gratitude, but must you greet me with hostility every time?"

"Gratitude? For what? For manipulating Charlotte to testify against Genevieve?"

Isabella’s chest heaved, her eyes blazing. Even her scornful laugh was breathtaking. "Sebastian, you’re shameless. If anyone owes thanks, it’s you—not me. You used Charlotte to trap Genevieve. Admit it—without my unwitting help, would your plan have worked?"

"Isabella!"

Sebastian’s anger flared, his chest tight. His starry eyes burned red. "I just wanted to see you."

"Well, I don’t want to see you!"

Her left hand was trapped in his iron grip. She couldn’t break free—fighting him was futile. She reached for her phone with her free hand, but Sebastian anticipated it, capturing that wrist too.

Cornered, Isabella screamed for help—but her cry was cut off as Sebastian’s lips crashed onto hers.

His warm breath enveloped her trembling lips. His grip was slick with sweat, beads of perspiration trickling down his forehead.

The first time he’d kissed her like this, he’d been drunk.

This time, he had no excuse.

"Sebastian, you’re divorced. This is wrong."

But desire didn’t care about right or wrong.

His heart pounded wildly. His usually unshakable self-control teetered on the edge.

His kiss grew fiercer, as if he wanted to consume her.

Isabella resisted with all her might. But under his control, her lips tangled with his, her breath stolen. Gradually, her strength waned, her body yielding.

Frustration. Anger.

A single tear rolled down her cheek.

She was just a woman who’d loved this man for thirteen years—only to be left unrequited. What sin had she committed to deserve such humiliation?

"Sebastian! You’re a monster!"

A furious roar echoed through the corridor. Nathaniel, eyes blazing, charged forward, yanking Sebastian off Isabella and swinging a punch at his face!

But Sebastian dodged effortlessly.

"Nathaniel!"

Isabella’s hoarse cry went unheard. Nathaniel’s mind was filled with the image of Isabella being forced into that kiss—Sebastian’s lips smeared with her red lipstick.

"Sebastian. I’ll kill you!"

Sebastian’s eyes narrowed slightly.

Nathaniel was a taekwondo black belt, famed for his swift kicks. He spun, his leg shooting toward Sebastian’s chest.

But even his best was too slow.

In a flash, Sebastian moved behind him, gripping his shoulder. With a swift motion, Nathaniel was brought down.

"What kind of move was that?!"

Nathaniel had thought such techniques existed only in martial arts novels.

But Isabella recognized it instantly—a close-combat maneuver from military training.

"Nathaniel, stop! Sebastian!"

She caught the weakened Nathaniel. Without her support, he might’ve knelt before Sebastian.

"Miss Isabella, I’m fine," Nathaniel gasped, but he couldn’t even stand.

"You can’t stand, and you say you’re fine?"

Isabella glared at Sebastian, her eyes red with fury. "How dare you hurt my people in front of me? Sebastian, are you even human? Is that handsome face just a mask for a heart of stone?"

Guilt flashed in Sebastian’s dark eyes. He looked defeated.

"He attacked first. Besides, I didn’t hurt him. The pressure point will release by tonight—he’ll be fine."

"Save your excuses. The more you talk, the more despicable you sound!"

The tears in Isabella’s eyes pierced Sebastian’s heart. She wiped her lips roughly with the back of her hand, as if erasing his touch.

"Sebastian, admit it. You regret the divorce, don’t you?"

His heart clenched. He couldn’t even muster a simple "No."

All he had left was pride.

"If you won’t answer, I’ll take that as a yes."

Isabella’s voice trembled, but she laughed brilliantly. "But let me tell you—even if you do regret it, keep those illicit feelings to yourself. Your affection is the greatest insult to my dignity."

"I’ve had enough, Isabella. A loveless marriage was torture for me."

"Arabella’s coming back. You need to step down as Mrs. Vanderbilt."

The cruel words he’d thrown at her during their divorce rushed back, biting at him like a rabid beast, leaving him in tatters.

Dazed, Sebastian stumbled to the underground parking garage.

He didn’t know how he got there. His head throbbed, his limbs stiff—like a mortally wounded man on death’s doorstep.

When he saw Gordon, his last ounce of strength drained away.

"Mr. Vanderbilt!"

Gordon rushed to support him, alarmed by his pallor. "Is your headache acting up? Get in the car—I’ll get your medicine."

Headaches could be medicated.

But what cured heartache?

"Gordon, I don’t understand."

Sebastian clutched his head, panting. "When she was my wife, I never cared. I treated her horribly, yet she stayed. Now that I’m kind to her, why is she so cruel?"

Gordon’s heart ached for the tormented man. After a pause, he sighed softly.

"Mr. Vanderbilt, it’s because Mrs. Vanderbilt loved you deeply back then."

But now, she didn’t.
###Chapter 244

The moment Alexander Kingsley left, Isabella Sinclair helped a numb Nathaniel Whitmore back to the office.

She guided his trembling body to the couch, his forehead glistening with sweat, lips pressed into a tight line. With the precision of a seasoned surgeon, she began examining his limbs.

"Miss Isabella, I'm fine."

Though Nathaniel was numb, he wasn't completely incapacitated. Seeing her concern for him, his throat tightened. "I'm sorry for causing you trouble."

"Don't be ridiculous. You were protecting me." Her voice softened as she massaged his legs. "Just don't be so reckless next time."

"I wasn't reckless."

Nathaniel forced himself to sit up, his gaze unwavering. "Even if it happened a thousand times, I'd still be the first to jump in front of you."

"Nathaniel, you can't rely on brute strength and underestimate your opponent. You're no match for Alexander! Do you think he spent four years in military school for nothing?"

Her eyes burned with worry. "He went easy on you today. If you weren't my man, he might've broken your arm!"

"I don't care! What's death to me?"

Nathaniel stood shakily, his tall frame towering over her. "Even if it kills me, I won't let that bastard lay a finger on you!"

"Nathaniel."

Her breath caught as she met his tear-filled eyes.

Then, without realizing it, tears spilled down his cheeks.

"Nathaniel, crying again?"

She teased lightly, her heart aching as she wiped his tears away.

Suddenly, he gathered his courage and pulled her into a crushing embrace.

His arms locked around her waist, his hand pressing against her back as if he wanted to fuse her into his pounding chest.

Isabella wasn't oblivious—she felt the raw emotion in his hold.

"Nathaniel, let go. We need to talk."

She gently pushed him away.

"Miss Isabella, I'll accept any punishment you see fit for my actions."

His face was streaked with tears, like melting ice.

He knew he was playing the victim card, shamelessly begging for her mercy.

It was pathetic, but he was furious, desperate, on the verge of losing his mind.

Yet Isabella wasn't one to be swayed by emotions.

Her expression hardened, voice cold. "Starting tomorrow, you're taking a week off. Go home and rest."

"But Miss Isabella—"

His heart twisted.

"Your stress levels are too high, and your emotions are unstable. Use this week to reflect. Think about how you want to continue working beside me."

Meanwhile, Victoria Sterling had been interrogated by the police for a full day.

For someone accustomed to luxury, these twenty-four hours were torture. Though she was given food and water, she wasn't allowed to sleep. Exhaustion weighed on her, dark circles under her eyes, her body stiff from sitting too long.

Harsh lights glared down, making her expensive hair look dry and lifeless.

It was pure agony.

"I didn't do it! Caroline wasn't my spy! This has nothing to do with me! Isabella framed me—I'm the victim here!"

Victoria's voice was hoarse, but she kept denying, stubborn as a mule.

Just then, the interrogation room door opened.

A man in a tailored suit entered, carrying a sleek briefcase, exuding calm confidence.

"Officers, I'm Ms. Sterling's attorney, Cedric Dempsey."

Cedric—the infamous lawyer?

Victoria's eyes lit up.

He gave her a reassuring smile. "I need to speak with my client privately."

Once alone, Victoria grabbed his hand, tears streaming. "Mr. Cedric! Did my father send you? Please, get me out of here—I can't take it anymore!"

"Ms. Sterling, rest assured. If I took your case, I have at least an 80% chance of acquittal."

His voice was smooth, but his gaze sharpened. "But you must cooperate fully. Tell me everything—no lies, no omissions."

"Yes, yes!"

She nodded frantically, recalling how Cedric had handled even her mother's scandals. If anyone could save her, it was him. She spilled every detail.

Cedric listened without interruption.

"Mr. Cedric, can't you do something about Isabella? She's despicable!"

Victoria slammed her fist on the table. "If it weren't for that witch, I wouldn't be in this mess!"

"Ms. Sterling, Isabella is your prosecutor—and the victim. You know her background."

His tone darkened. "Our opponent is formidable. The Sinclair heiress is ruthless. Getting you acquitted is already a challenge. Don't expect more."

Victoria bit back her frustration.

"Your informant, Caroline, had ties to the editor-in-chief of Pioneer Post. That weakens the witness's credibility."

Cedric twirled his pen expertly. "And that suspect, Kevin? He was romantically involved with Caroline before the incident. That's our breakthrough."

"You mean... pin it all on Kevin?"

Her voice dropped to a whisper, shock lacing her tone.

Cedric smirked.

"But would he take the fall? He cut ties with Caroline."

"Leave that to me."

Cedric had built his reputation not just through the Dempsey family's influence or his legal brilliance—but through cunning ruthlessness.

To win, sometimes you had to play dirty.

Despite Nathaniel's pleas, Isabella stood firm on his suspension.

It wasn't for rest—it was for reflection.

Meanwhile, after persistent requests, Isabella—under her alias, Alea—finally agreed to meet Ada.

Ada, the international superstar, shed all pretense in front of Isabella. She poured tea, her gaze nothing short of worshipful.

Isabella didn't toy with her. Business came first. Pride was pointless—profit and publicity mattered.

So, she agreed to redesign Ada's wedding.

Ada nearly collapsed in gratitude.

Not only that, she promised an unlimited budget and swore to be K Group's free spokesperson—anything to make amends.

"President Sinclair, what's this?"

Ada stared at the document in shock.

Isabella sipped her coffee elegantly. "Your new wedding plan."

Ada and her manager exchanged stunned looks. "Already?"

Such speed was unheard of.

"I was prepared."

Isabella set her cup down. "When I designed your first wedding, I had a backup. Didn't think I'd need it."

Ada's lips trembled.

"President Sinclair, the wedding's soon. Is this too ambitious? Will there be time?"

Her manager frowned.

"You love gothic style, don't you? Ever considered black roses?"

Isabella's almond eyes curved knowingly.

"Black roses?"

Ada gasped.

"The original venue was red roses. Replacing them with Black Swan roses would save time."

Ada's face flushed with excitement.

The first design was perfect—but this was her dream.

Black roses symbolized mystery, desire, exclusivity.

Dark, yet deeply romantic.

"Black roses? Isn't that... ominous?"

Her manager paled.

He knew this would trend online—a celebrity wedding with black roses? The publicity would be insane.

President Sinclair was a commercial genius. Profit was just the bonus—brand exposure was the real prize. But wasn't Ada being exploited?

"Is this my wedding or yours?"

Ada shot him a glare. "I trust President Sinclair completely. I accept all her suggestions. Stay out of it!"

After resigning the contract, Isabella sent them away and briefed her team before heading home.

Outside, Cassius Sinclair's Rolls Royce waited, the door held open respectfully.

"Cassius! You're free to pick me up today?"

She leaped into the car, throwing her arms around his neck playfully.

"I heard you suspended Nathaniel."

He ruffled her hair.

"Mmm, he's been overworked. Needs rest."

"Really?"

Cassius saw right through her. "You're swamped. Now's when you need help most. Suspending him now—what's the real reason? Did you two fight?"

She frowned. "Cassius, that's a weird way to put it. We're not in a relationship—there's nothing to fight about."

"So, he has feelings for you, and you panicked?"

Her eyes widened. "Cassius!"

"Nathaniel's crush is obvious to everyone."

He smiled faintly.

"Everyone?"

"Suri told me days ago. She didn't want to say it directly, so she told me."

Isabella groaned. Nathaniel's secret was public knowledge now.

How mortifying.

"Suri's worried his feelings might affect your daily life. You two live alone in the Elmsworth mansion. She's concerned."

Cassius's tone turned serious as he held her hand.

Isabella understood. Suri saw her as a daughter—of course she'd worry.

She feared Nathaniel might lose control.

"I trust Nathaniel's character. He wouldn't cross the line. But you suddenly suspended him—I had to ask."

His eyes darkened with concern.

"I gave him time to reflect."

Facing Cassius, she dropped all pretense. "I noticed his feelings. This suspension is for him to adjust. If he can't move on, I can't keep him by my side."

Cassius frowned. "You'd really cut him off?"

"It's for his own good."

She sighed. "I won't fall in love again in this lifetime. There's no future for us. If he stays, seeing me every day but never having me—wouldn't that hurt him? I know the pain of unrequited love. I won't let someone I care about suffer like that. Nathaniel deserves better."

Cassius's heart ached. He pulled her into a tight embrace.

Then his phone rang.

Holding her with one arm, he answered coldly. "What?"

"President Sinclair, Victoria's been acquitted! Cedric bailed her out!"

After three days in custody, Victoria Sterling was finally free.
###Chapter 245

The news reached Thaddeus despite Cedric's efforts to suppress it through Frederic's connections.

"Why was Glynnis freed? Weren't you monitoring Caroline? Did you let Cedric near her?" Thaddeus's expression turned glacial, his fist slamming against the car window in frustration.

"Mr. Thaddeus, Caroline wasn't the issue. It was Kevin!"

Gordon's eyes burned with fury. "Our source confirmed Cedric visited Kevin at the detention center disguised as a proxy lawyer, with Frederic's backing. Whatever he said terrified Kevin into taking full blame, clearing Glynnis!"

"What else could he do but exploit Kevin's weakness—threatening his family? A top-tier lawyer resorting to such vile tactics!" Thaddeus's hazel eyes darkened like a brewing storm, his fists trembling with restrained rage. "The Justice family's honor is tarnished by their eldest son!"

"Mr. Thaddeus, with Kevin as the scapegoat, what about Caroline's—"

Gordon's phone interrupted him.

"What now?"

After listening, Gordon's face paled. "Mr. Thaddeus! Emergency! The police just arrested her for defamation and perjury!"

An expected outcome.

Though Caroline deserved it.

Yet Thaddeus's fury erupted, his eyes blazing crimson!

Meanwhile, Glynnis returned to Windermere Estate in hysterics, as if resurrected. She and her mother staged a tearful reunion before Frederic and Hamilton, their melodramatic display worthy of an Oscar. Glynnis, once a mediocre actress, had perfected her craft.

"Mom! Dad! You must avenge me! Evadne and Edith set me up—those vicious witches!"

Spotting her grandfather, Glynnis seized the chance to slander Evadne. She knelt by Hamilton's wheelchair, sobbing. "Grandpa! Evadne wants me dead! She's cunning and cruel! Thank heavens for Cedric, or you'd never see me again!"

Hamilton wavered, torn between disbelief in Evadne's malice and the police evidence implicating her in Glynnis's arrest.

The old man relived the agony of favoritism—twenty years prior, during Abernathy Group's expansion, his sons Frederic and Felix were embroiled in bribery scandals. Hamilton's bias spared Frederic, leaving Felix to face prison, where he died of a heart attack six months in. The loss devastated Hamilton and his wife, hastening her decline.

"Grandpa! I warned you Evadne has ulterior motives. Marrying into the Abernathy family was her scheme!"

Glynnis wept on his shoulder. "Her kindness was a ruse—she's after the company shares!"

"Exactly, Dad!" Elspeth joined the smear campaign. "Evadne hid her identity as Emeric's daughter to manipulate you! She even married Thaddeus—a calculated plot! Thankfully he saw through her and divorced her. Imagine if she'd controlled him and infiltrated the company!"

"Enough. Evadne isn't that kind of girl." Hamilton waved dismissively, though gloom settled over him. "Emeric, despite his playboy reputation, is honorable. He wouldn't raise a deceitful daughter."

"Dad!"

"Grandpa!"

"Besides, the Ashbourne Group rivals ours in wealth. Would Evadne ruin her happiness for a fraction of Abernathy shares? More likely a Stirling would stoop so low. Evadne is heaven's darling—she'd never degrade herself!" Hamilton's defense of Evadne only infuriated Elspeth further.

She seethed, itching to overturn his wheelchair.

"Dad, regardless, Evadne has been hostile toward us!" Frederic grumbled, deflecting his parenting failures. "Even if we have internal issues, it's not her place to interfere! She's used Ashbourne's influence to target us repeatedly—first Elspeth, now Glynnis over a minor incident! Her aggression proves she's severed ties with us. She'd choose her interests over you in a heartbeat!"

Hamilton gripped his armrests, chest heaving.

"Mr. Murray, summon Evadne. I'll hear her side."

Outside Windermere Estate, Thaddeus's Maybach idled at the gates as Gordon opened his door.

The moment Thaddeus stepped out, a black Maserati pulled up beside them.

Cedric emerged, impeccably suited, meeting Thaddeus's icy glare.

"What a coincidence, Mr. Thaddeus."

"Hardly. Did Frederic hire you for more dirty work?" Thaddeus's smirk was razor-sharp.

Cedric remained unruffled. "Frederic retained me as Glynnis's lawyer. Professional integrity demands I see it through. Your disdain only reveals your ignorance of the legal profession. To each their own."

Thaddeus advanced, his aura menacing.

Cedric instinctively retreated half a step—a silent concession.

"The law is a murky realm. Some lawyers champion justice for the oppressed. Others, like you, serve the wealthy, prioritizing profit over principle."

Cedric's smile stiffened.

"I won't interfere with your pursuits. But heed this warning." Thaddeus's gaze turned lethal. "Scheme all you want. But Evadne is off-limits. Harm her, even slightly, and you'll regret it."
###Chapter 246

Thaddeus's words struck like lightning before he turned on his heel and stormed out, his posture rigid with barely contained fury.

Cedric stood frozen, his face burning with humiliation.

Born into the prestigious Dempsey legal dynasty, he had always been the golden child—admired by his parents, idolized by his siblings, and revered by Elmsworth's elite.

Even the wealthiest magnates bent over backward to secure his services.

When had he ever been treated with such contempt?

Wait.

Cedric's eyes narrowed as he watched Thaddeus disappear down the hall.

What exactly was Thaddeus's relationship with Evadne? And why would a man known for his icy composure lose control over her?

Evadne Ashbourne—the untouchable heiress, a goddess among mortals. She had the world at her feet yet barely spared a glance at ordinary men.

There was only one explanation. Thaddeus, the bastard son, was obsessed with her.

So what if he was handsome and cunning?

His mother had never been acknowledged, and his CEO title was nothing but charity from the Abernathy heir.

"Wearing a crown doesn't make you king, Thaddeus," Cedric muttered under his breath. "You think someone like you could ever deserve Evadne Ashbourne? Keep dreaming."

With a cold sneer, he strode into the mansion.

The room fell silent as Thaddeus and Cedric entered one after the other.

"Father, Cedric is an exceptional attorney," Frederic announced proudly. "Without him, Glynnis wouldn't have been acquitted so swiftly. I intend to appoint him as head of the Abernathy Group's legal department. What do you think?"

"Mr. Frederic, it's an honor." Cedric extended a hand, his smile polished.

"Cedric Dempsey," Hamilton mused, studying him. "Dave's eldest son?"

"Yes, sir." Cedric's chest swelled with pride. "You know my father?"

Thaddeus observed from the sidelines, his expression unreadable.

He despised Cedric's smarmy demeanor, but something about Hamilton's tone gave him pause.

"Of course I know him," Hamilton replied, his smile razor-thin. "Your father presided over Felix's trial. Sentenced him to four years—fair and impartial, wasn't he?"

A collective gasp filled the room.

Cedric's smile faltered.

Frederic's face darkened at the mention of Felix.

Thaddeus didn't miss the flicker of pain in his father's eyes.

"Mr. Hamilton, my father is... principled. I apologize if his judgment caused any distress."

Cedric hadn't expected the conversation to take this turn. He bowed slightly, scrambling to recover.

"Apologize?" Hamilton arched a brow. "For what? Doing his job?"

Cedric stiffened.

"Isn't integrity the cornerstone of law? Or are you implying your father was wrong to uphold it?"

"That's not what I meant—"

"You're quite the celebrity yourself," Hamilton cut in. "Only representing the wealthy and connected. Quite different from your father's values."

The thinly veiled insult hung in the air.

Thaddeus smirked. Frederic and Elspeth exchanged uneasy glances.

"Mr. Hamilton!"

Mr. Murray hurried in. "Ms. Evadne has arrived."

Thaddeus's pulse spiked, his gaze snapping to the entrance.

All eyes followed.

The sharp click of heels echoed like gunfire.

Evadne walked in alone, her regal presence commanding the room. She might as well have been a stranger stepping through those doors for the first time.

For a heartbeat, Thaddeus's vision blurred.

It felt like they were still married.

"Grandpa."

Evadne's smile was radiant as she breezed past everyone—ignoring Thaddeus completely.

As if he didn't exist.

The ache in his chest was unbearable.

Every encounter with her since the divorce was torture.

"Evadne."

Glynnis glared, her fingers curling into fists. Only Elspeth's grip kept her from lunging.

"Oh? Cedric Dempsey." Evadne paused, her voice honeyed. "What a surprise."

The room froze.

Cedric's smile turned brittle.

"Ms. Evadne. It's been a while."

"Five or six years, hasn't it? Since you last visited my father." Her gaze flicked to Frederic. "Our families go way back. Mr. Dempsey even served as K Group's legal head after retirement—though he was too modest to boast about it."

Cedric's ears burned.

She was dismantling him with every word.

Frederic's brows rose. "I wasn't aware of your connection."

"My father resigned years ago," Cedric interjected hastily. "We've had no ties to the Ashbournes since."

"Really?" Evadne's smile turned glacial. "Then you must've forgotten how my father saved your family from ruin when yours was on the brink. We never asked for repayment."

She stepped closer, her voice dropping to a whisper.

"But helping my enemies? That's how you repay kindness?"

Her laugh was cold, beautiful, and utterly merciless.

"Is this what they teach you in law school?"
###Chapter 247

Evadne's sharp rebuttal struck Cedric like a slap across the face, tearing away his carefully constructed facade. The shameful label of an ungrateful man now hung over him, exposed for all to see.

She smirked inwardly. Trying to cut ties with the Ashbournes? Fine. But I'll make sure everyone knows exactly what kind of man you are. Every dirty secret you've buried—I'll drag them into the light.

Cedric's lips pressed into a thin line. Though his face still wore a practiced smile, his eyes betrayed him—cold and calculating as they locked onto Evadne.

This was the woman who had Jason utterly bewitched? Spoiled, arrogant, with a tongue sharper than any blade. Bringing such a troublesome creature into the Dempsey household would be inviting chaos. Peace would become a distant memory.

The air grew thick with tension.

Frederic watched the exchange with mounting dread. Evadne was a walking catastrophe—wherever she appeared, storms followed. Cedric's legal prowess was undeniable, and Frederic had long sought to secure his loyalty. But this unexpected connection to the Ashbournes? It left him deeply unsettled.

"Interesting," Thaddeus mused, his deep voice cutting through the silence. Though his words were directed at Cedric, his piercing gaze remained fixed on Evadne. "So Mr. Cedric shares a history with the Ashbourne family. Tell me—is this how you repay the daughter of your family's benefactor?"

Evadne's brow furrowed.

Was he... defending her? Taking her side against his own family?

When they were married, he'd never once stood up for her. Now he wanted to play the hero?

Absolutely not.

Hamilton's frown deepened at Thaddeus's words.

"By that logic, Ms. Evadne," Cedric countered smoothly, though his smile had grown strained, "should I abandon my legal career simply because the Dempseys owe your family a debt? I'm a professional. In my world, there are only clients and non-clients. Miss Glynnis is my client—I serve her to the best of my ability. That's non-negotiable. Were you to hire me tomorrow, I'd extend you the same courtesy. This isn't about gratitude—it's about principle."

Thaddeus's eyes darkened as he watched Cedric's smug expression. His fists clenched at his sides.

"Oh, I wouldn't dare hire you, Mr. Cedric!" Evadne waved her hands in mock horror. "A lawyer of your caliber is a double-edged sword. Today you fight for me—tomorrow, who's to say you won't turn that blade against me?" She touched her cheek thoughtfully. "After all, if you'd turn your back on your own father's savior, what chance would I stand? No, I'll pass on retaining someone so... unpredictable."

She was every bit as formidable as Acacia in her prime.

Watching Evadne's innocent-yet-devious expression, Thaddeus couldn't help the smirk that tugged at his lips.

Cedric cleared his throat uncomfortably, anger simmering beneath his polished exterior.

Glynnis had intended to humiliate Evadne on her own turf, using Jim's presence to exact revenge. But after Evadne's verbal onslaught—which even Cedric couldn't counter—she'd retreated behind Elspeth like a frightened turtle.

"Grandfather!" Evadne took Hamilton's frail hand, her eyes brimming with concern. Strangely, she seemed more like his true granddaughter than Glynnis ever had. "Are you feeling unwell? Is that why you called for me?"

"Don't fret, child." Hamilton patted her hand gently. "I'm quite alright. In fact, I've never felt better."

Evadne exhaled in relief. "Good."

"The truth is, I missed you," Hamilton admitted. "I wanted to see you. And... I wanted to discuss this matter between you and Glynnis. What exactly happened? Why has it escalated to this point?" His expression grew solemn. "You're both precious to me. This discord... it weighs heavily on my heart."

But Evadne understood. This wasn't about fairness—it was about protecting his blood.

A wave of sorrow crashed over her. No matter how much she cared for Hamilton, she'd never truly be family. Not like Glynnis—even if the girl was a viper who delighted in stabbing her in the back.

"Father!" Elspeth cried, clutching her weeping daughter. "Look what they did to Glynnis at the police station! They interrogated her day and night—threatened her, screamed at her, denied her sleep! Just look at her—she's barely recognizable!"

Indeed, Glynnis looked haggard—though much of it was theatrics.

Hamilton studied his granddaughter. She'd never been as accomplished as Evadne, nor as diligent in visiting him. But she was his flesh and blood. All he wanted was harmony.

Thaddeus noted the way Evadne's eyes reddened, her usual fiery spirit dimming. His chest tightened.

She was the wronged party here.

It reminded him painfully of their marriage—how she'd always been treated as an outsider. Back then, he'd been too blind to cherish her. In fact, he'd secretly hoped she'd grow weary and ask for a divorce.

History seemed determined to repeat itself.

But Thaddeus had learned his lesson. He wouldn't make the same mistake twice.

With purposeful strides, he closed the distance between them. Before anyone could react, he slid an arm around Evadne's slender shoulders, pulling her firmly against his side.

As if she'd always belonged there. As if they'd never parted.

Evadne's breath caught, her blood running cold.

"Thaddeus—?"

"Grandfather," he said smoothly, tightening his grip when she tried to pull away. "Instead of interrogating Ms. Evadne, perhaps you should ask your beloved granddaughter what she's been up to."
###Chapter 248

The heat from Alexander's palm seared through Isabella's skin like wildfire.

Her thoughts were sharp. This lunatic! What's his problem now? Get your filthy hand off me!

As if sensing her resistance, his fingers dug deeper into her shoulder, locking her in place with an iron grip.

The sight of the ex-couple in such close proximity stunned everyone in the room.

Only their grandfather, Reginald, wore a knowing grin. His previously tense expression melted into pure delight, his lips parting in silent joy.

Well, well. Has Alexander finally come to his senses? Though Isabella doesn’t look too thrilled about it.

Whether it was relentless pursuit or sheer stubbornness, at least his thick-headed grandson was finally making a move! Any progress between them deserved a celebration—preferably with fireworks.

Isabella had had enough. Seizing the moment, she lifted her foot and slammed her stiletto down—hard.

A barely audible grunt escaped Alexander’s lips, his brows twitching in pain.

Only she heard it.

A smirk curled her lips as she twisted her heel against the polished leather of his designer shoes.

Ah. Satisfaction.

Alexander’s jaw clenched, his lips trembling from the sharp sting.

The pain was so intense it nearly knocked the breath out of him.

His dark eyes flickered down to the woman in his arms, her smug expression lighting up her face.

Against his will, the tension in his expression softened.

Does tormenting me really make her this happy?

Fine. If it did, he’d let her do it again.

"Grandpa! I’m being framed!"

Glynnis, realizing the ex-couple’s display was turning the tide against her, yanked Cedric forward to plead her innocence. "If I were guilty, not even Mr. Cedric could have gotten me acquitted! The police aren’t idiots—they’d have found evidence by now! This is all Isabella’s doing!"

"Mr. Hamilton, the legal system follows strict procedures," Cedric interjected smoothly, stepping in as her knight in shining armor. "As Miss Glynnis’s lawyer, my duty is to protect her rights—not manipulate the truth."

His gaze then slid to Isabella, cool and calculating. "Ms. Sinclair, whatever personal vendetta you hold against my client, resorting to underhanded tactics is beneath you. As the daughter of the magnanimous Emeric Sinclair, shouldn’t you be more forgiving?"

Isabella’s eyes narrowed, a scoff escaping her lips.

This man must live off tabloid gossip. Does he forget how his father groveled at Emeric’s feet when he was a boy?

Cedric had masterfully shifted the blame, turning the tables on her.

Then—

A low, chilling laugh cut through the tension.

Even Isabella shivered at the sound.

"Mr. Cedric," Alexander’s voice was velvet laced with steel, "you seem to have mistaken my patience for weakness."

His crimson-tinged gaze pinned Cedric in place. "What did I tell you before you walked in here? Or has your memory failed you already?"

Isabella’s pulse jumped.

He spoke to Cedric before this?

About what?

Elspeth and Glynnis recoiled, the weight of Alexander’s presence pressing down like a suffocating shadow.

Cedric’s polished facade cracked, his expression twisting between shock and fury.

"Alexander!" Frederic snapped. "Mind your tone! Mr. Cedric is our guest!"

He still needed Cedric’s connections. His son was sabotaging his plans.

"He’s your guest," Alexander corrected icily, his gaze never leaving Isabella’s.

When their eyes met, the world around them blurred.

Only she existed.

"I warned you," he murmured, his voice a dark promise. "Anyone who dares hurt Isabella will answer to me."

Her breath hitched.

Cedric’s throat bobbed, his fists clenching at his sides.

"Mr. Cedric," Alexander purred, "do you remember now?"
###Chapter 249

Every time Isabella stepped into the Abernathy mansion, it felt like a hurricane had torn through the place, leaving nothing but wreckage and tension in its wake.

She had no patience to explain herself to Harrison. The truth would come out eventually—she was sure of it.

Besides, she'd already gotten a taste of Cedric's true nature from Alexander and Olivia. If he could pull strings to get Victoria out of trouble, it meant he'd covered all his tracks. Even if she exposed his role in framing Kevin, the case was closed. The police wouldn't reopen it.

Cedric's smile was as polished as a gentleman's, but his actions? Pure venom.

Harrison, at least, didn't press her. He trusted her. He'd seen the fire in her, the unwavering loyalty beneath her sharp edges.

And if he couldn't trust her, who else in this world was worth believing in?

Isabella personally wheeled Harrison back to his room, with Nathaniel trailing behind like a shadow.

She was irritated, but Harrison seemed pleased, his aged face glowing with satisfaction. The tension in the air almost felt like a tonic, breathing new life into him.

"Grandpa, I'm sorry I haven’t visited lately," she murmured, guilt tightening her chest. "Things have been... complicated."

"Don’t worry, child. Just knowing you think of me is enough." He squeezed her hand warmly before glancing at Nathaniel. "You're young. You should be out there, meeting people. I hear you've been spending time with Adrian. Any interest there? Bring him around—I'll vet him for you."

Nathaniel's jaw clenched like he'd been sucker-punched. Harrison, sitting there in his wheelchair, was playing matchmaker with terrifying nonchalance.

"Grandpa, how do you even know about Adrian?" Isabella asked, startled.

Harrison chuckled. "I may be old, but I'm not out of touch."

"We grew up together," she admitted.

"Childhood sweethearts?" Harrison's eyes twinkled.

She scoffed. "More like an older sister looking after a sickly kid." She struck a pose, hand on her hip, chin lifted.

Nathaniel's head throbbed. The way she laughed—it reminded him of someone. A girl from his past, just out of reach.

"Is that so? Strange you never mentioned your connection to the Lockwoods before."

"Adrian moved to Helgen with his mother. We lost touch until recently."

"Ah. I heard he donated a priceless necklace at your charity gala. Seems he still cares."

Isabella shrugged. "Probably just repaying a childhood debt."

Harrison shot Nathaniel a pointed look. "Hmph. At least Adrian knows how to show affection. Unlike some block of ice I could name."

"Grandpa," Isabella cut in sharply, "don’t hold a grudge against Nathaniel because of our divorce. It was mutual. I don’t blame him."

Her voice was calm, but Nathaniel felt the words like a knife. Regret twisted inside him.

As she turned to leave, he followed. "I'll walk you out."

Isabella spun around, finger jabbing at him. "Stop!"

Nathaniel blinked.

She flushed, realizing she'd meant to say don't but it came out wrong.

"Whatever! Same difference!"

"I don’t need an escort, Nathaniel. I’m a grown woman—I can find my own way home."

"It’s late. I’m walking you." He stepped closer.

She remembered the way he'd held her earlier. Teeth gritted, she brushed imaginary lint off her shoulder. "Listen, I didn’t lose my temper earlier because I have feelings for you. I was just keeping it civil for Harrison’s sake. Don’t push it."

Her glare was sharp enough to cut glass. "I’m already furious about Cedric and Victoria. Even a stray dog would get snapped at right now. You want to be next?"

She thought she sounded impressively intimidating.

Nathaniel just smirked.

"If Cedric bothers you again, tell me. I’ll handle him."

She scoffed. "No thanks. Whatever happens between the Sterlings and the Sinclairs is none of your business. Stay out of it."

She remembered how he'd defended her in front of the Abernathys, humiliating Cedric. A bitter taste rose in her throat.

But then it hit her—Nathaniel wasn’t protecting her. He was protecting his own interests.

If Cedric became the Abernathy Group’s legal advisor, Harrison would have another powerful ally. And that was bad news for Nathaniel.

The realization made her sneer.

Just as Nathaniel moved toward her again, a sharp voice cut through the air.

"Nathaniel!"

Frederic strode toward them, expression stern.

"Study. Now."

"I’ll be there. After I see Isabella home."

Frederic laughed coldly. "Home? She left five minutes ago."

Nathaniel turned—but Isabella was already gone.

Outside, the night air was crisp.

"Isabella."

She froze. Cedric stood there, smirking.

"Like it or not, I got Victoria out of this mess. Losing to me isn’t the worst thing."

She tilted her head. "Actually, the more I think about it, the more I feel like I won."

His smile faltered.

"Thanks to Victoria, I got to see the real Cedric Sterling. Most people complain about the chef after they’ve eaten. But you? You smash the plate." She smirked. "Tell me, if your father knew his golden boy’s greatest ambition was licking billionaires’ boots and betraying his own allies—would he be proud?"

Cedric’s face darkened. "Isabella, I’ve been lenient because you’re Alexander’s daughter. But you’re crossing a line. Do you think your last name makes you untouchable?"

She grinned. "Oh, it absolutely does. And I intend to use it."

Her eyes narrowed dangerously. "So next time you come at me, remember who I am. And who stands behind me."

She turned on her heel and walked away, leaving Cedric seething.

His voice chased after her. "Don’t mistake me for my pathetic brother Daniel. He might be content as your family’s lapdog—but I’m not that weak. We’ll see who laughs last."
###Chapter 250

The study was tense with the presence of both Isabella Sinclair and Victoria Sterling.

Nathan Prescott would never allow Alexander Kingsley to step foot inside. In his eyes, Alexander had chosen Eleanor Sinclair's side.

At this point, father and son were practically at war.

Ever since Cynthia, Alexander's birth mother, had taken her own life, their relationship had become nothing more than a hollow title.

The rift between them, now widened by Eleanor, was exactly what Isabella wanted.

Only when they were at each other’s throats could she exploit the chaos and seize control of Sinclair Holdings!

Even if Nathan was the father of this illegitimate child, what did it matter?

"I called you here to inform you of something," Nathan said coldly, tossing a freshly printed appointment letter onto the table. "I’ve decided to officially hire Sebastian Wright as the legal advisor of Sinclair Holdings, as well as the head of the legal department. This appointment will be issued first thing tomorrow morning. I’ve already signed it—your approval as CEO isn’t necessary."

Isabella and Victoria exchanged smug smiles.

"I don’t agree," Alexander replied without hesitation, his voice icy.

"I don’t need your agreement. Sebastian is a rare talent. Don’t you understand how crucial it is for a corporation to secure an exceptional lawyer?"

"Did you not hear the conversation between Eleanor and Sebastian tonight?"

Alexander's eyes darkened, his lips curling into a sneer. "He’s an ungrateful, profit-driven snake. And you want to bring him into Sinclair Holdings? Do you intend to stoop to his level?"

"You insolent brat!"

Nathan shot to his feet, his vision blurring from the sudden movement. Isabella quickly steadied him.

"Nathan, don’t get angry—it’s bad for your health!" She patted his back soothingly, though inwardly, she was gloating.

"The Sinclair family has done the Prescott family a great favor. Emeric took care of us, even placing his own brother Jason in Kingsley Enterprises. And yet, Sebastian betrays his benefactors for his own gain. Do you really think you can control someone like that? If someone offers him better terms tomorrow, do you honestly believe he’ll stay loyal to Sinclair Holdings?" Alexander struck at the heart of the matter, leaving no room for argument.

"Alexander! You’re just making excuses to protect that devil, Eleanor!"

With no outsiders around, Nathan finally lost his composure, his face red with fury. "You’re defending her. Could it be that you’ve fallen for that wretched girl?"

"What if I have?" Alexander said softly, his words deliberate.

His heart pounded as if it might burst from his chest.

Nathan froze, as if struck by lightning.

Even Isabella and Victoria were stunned.

They couldn’t tell if Alexander truly meant it or if he was just defying Nathan.

After all, the only time this man had ever been foolish was when he chose Acacia over Eleanor, the jewel of the heavens.

"Alexander! Are you asking for regret medicine now? There’s no chance!"

Nathan trembled with rage, his voice cracking. "I’m telling you—even if you’ve fallen for Eleanor, you’d better forget about it! As long as I’m alive, I will never allow you to be with that Sinclair devil! If I’d known she was Emeric’s daughter, I would never have let you marry her! Three years of your life, wasted on her deception!"

The words hit Alexander like a volley of arrows.

His eyes burned red with fury, his pupils sharp as daggers, filled with a rage that could scorch the earth.

In the next second, he grabbed the crystal ashtray from the table and hurled it to the ground.

It shattered.

"Ah!"

Nathan flinched. Isabella and Victoria screamed.

Shards of crystal flew in all directions, some slicing through Isabella’s skirt and arm. Blood seeped out, and she nearly burst into tears from fear and anger.

"Eleanor did nothing wrong. What right do you have to judge her?"

Alexander clenched his fists, his voice low and dangerous. "What was wrong with her marrying me? Where did she fail me, you, or the Prescott family in those three years? I failed her. The entire Prescott family failed her! If anyone dares to speak against her again—even if it’s you—don’t blame me for being ruthless!"

That look in his eyes—

It was the same demonic gaze he’d had years ago, standing over his mother’s bloodied corpse.

Nathan’s breath hitched, his lips trembling.

Back then, when Cynthia had jumped, a young Alexander had clung to her lifeless body, staring at his father with that same terrifying expression.

He despised it. He feared it.

And now, for Eleanor, he was willing to turn against his own blood?

Isabella and Victoria, who had hoped to revel in his humiliation, were now too terrified to breathe.

Alexander took a deep breath, his eyes closing briefly. There was nothing left to say. He turned to leave.

"Alexander!"

Nathan’s voice was hoarse, shaking with emotion. "Are you really choosing Eleanor Sinclair over your own father? Remember your name. Remember whose blood runs in your veins. Without me, you would never have risen to where you are today—never would have held power in Sinclair Holdings."

This wasn’t a new argument.

Alexander didn’t even flinch. If anything, he was annoyed.

"I made you who you are, and I can break you just as easily! Do you really think I won’t strip you of your position? Do you believe I won’t reduce you to nothing?" Nathan was hysterical.

Even Isabella, who had seen him angry many times, had rarely witnessed this level of fury.

"If that’s what you want to do, then go ahead. If you have the courage."

Alexander turned slowly, his gaze cold and unyielding. "For her, I don’t mind standing against the entire Sinclair Holdings."

As Alexander left the study, his broad shoulders sagged, his soul drained.

"Alexander."

A gentle voice called out. He lifted his tear-streaked eyes to see Reginald Kingsley standing before him.

He had been so lost in his turmoil that he hadn’t noticed the presence in the hallway.

Reginald was still in his day clothes, clearly not planning to stay the night at Windsor Estates.

"Grandfather."

His voice was rough, choked with emotion.

"I heard your conversation with your father."

Reginald sat in his wheelchair. Alexander bent down, allowing his grandfather to touch his shoulder.

"Though speaking back to your father is disrespectful, this time, I agree with you!"

Reginald chuckled, patting Alexander’s shoulder. "I don’t want Sebastian in Sinclair Holdings either. You’re right—a man who only cares about profit doesn’t belong in our company. Don’t worry. I may be retired, but I still have influence. If your father insists, I’ll step in."

"Grandfather, as CEO, this is my responsibility. You should be enjoying your retirement, not worrying about these matters." Alexander didn’t want his grandfather involved—it would be unfilial.

"Nonsense! I’m happy to help!"

Reginald grinned, studying Alexander closely. "You said you’d protect Eleanor and that you have feelings for her. Were you serious?"

Alexander hesitated, his heart pounding.

After a long pause, he swallowed hard. "I spoke out of anger. I didn’t mean it."

"Hmph. Fine. If you won’t admit it, that’s your choice!" Reginald sounded disappointed.

"Grandfather—"

"Come, take me home. It’s boring traveling alone. Keep me company!"

"Alright."

Alexander pushed the wheelchair, heading down the hallway with his grandfather.

Behind him, Reginald smiled knowingly.

Silly boy.

The words that slip out in anger are often the truest.
###Chapter 251

The extravagant wedding of Isabella Sinclair and the CEO of a prestigious international automotive brand unfolded flawlessly at The Chateau Royale.

That day, both domestic and international social media platforms were dominated by this sensational event.

Every major media outlet in New York mobilized their best teams, covering the occasion with unprecedented enthusiasm. The headlines were nothing short of spectacular!

[The Chateau Royale Triumphs Over Competitors to Host the Wedding of the Year!]

[Sinclair Group Makes Grand Entrance in New York! Vanderbilt Industries Suffers Humiliating Defeat!]

[Scandal Rocks Vanderbilt Family—How Can Such Disparities Exist Among the Elite?]

The spotlight on The Chateau Royale reached its zenith.

Netizens showered praise on the already-revealed Evelyn Sinclair, effortlessly contrasting her with the fading star, Victoria Sterling.

Clearly, Evelyn was the undisputed victor in this battle. After all, she was the queen—who did Alexander Kingsley think he was, daring to challenge her? He was utterly out of his depth!

Victoria had believed her attack would crush Evelyn. Instead, it backfired spectacularly, turning her into the city’s biggest joke.

Humiliated and battered by the public backlash, Victoria fell ill from sheer rage and had been bedridden ever since.

Margaret Vanderbilt, despite her competitive nature, had no choice but to nurse her daughter while desperately trying to regain William’s affection.

In her desperation, she underwent cosmetic enhancements, secretly purchased risqué lingerie, and even bought aphrodisiac incense, hoping to seduce William as she had two decades ago.

But William seemed to be deliberately avoiding her, rarely returning home in the past week. Their encounters were brief and cold—he barely spared her a glance anymore.

Margaret seethed with resentment.

She blamed everything on Evelyn—that wretched girl!

The humiliation she endured today, she vowed to repay Evelyn a thousandfold in the future!

But no matter how much Margaret fumed, she couldn’t overshadow Evelyn’s radiant triumph.

The wedding of the century catapulted Sinclair Group—the leading financial conglomerate in Seattle—into the limelight in New York.

Not only that, Sinclair Group’s stocks soared throughout the day, with analysts predicting an even sharper rise the following morning.

And the excitement didn’t stop there.

When the wedding venue was unveiled, it ignited a nationwide frenzy!

[The black rose sea! Isabella’s wedding is breathtaking!]

[OMG! I want my wedding styled like this!]

[Traditional weddings are outdated—The Chateau Royale’s vision is perfection!]

Alexander Kingsley sat in his office, intently watching the live broadcast of Isabella’s wedding.

His cold, striking eyes softened, and a faint smile touched his lips.

He wasn’t usually interested in such events, but he knew this wedding was Evelyn’s masterpiece—and that made it worth his attention.

A knock interrupted his thoughts, and Daniel Carter entered, carrying a large olive-green duffel bag.

"Mr. Kingsley, the hiking gear you requested is ready."

"Thank you."

"Why the sudden interest in hiking this year?" Daniel asked curiously.

"I go every year," Alexander replied casually.

During his teenage years, to cope with stress, he had spent a summer volunteering at Misty Mountain Park.

Life had been simple then—just eating, sleeping, and accompanying the park ranger on hikes, assisting lost visitors or inspecting safety hazards.

It had been one of the few peaceful periods of his life.

After becoming CEO, he had quietly donated generously to the park annually—a secret known only to him and the ranger.

"Mr. Kingsley! Did you see Isabella’s wedding? Mrs. Sinclair is incredible!"

Daniel’s eyes sparkled with admiration, transforming into an unabashed Evelyn fanboy. "Black roses! How did she convince Isabella to use black roses? It’s genius!"

"Because she’s not ordinary. She’s Evelyn."

Alexander’s dark eyes curved with warmth. "That woman always finds a way."

Daniel’s jaw dropped.

Had he heard that right?

His boss had just called Evelyn that woman—with unmistakable fondness?

Was this the famously unshakable Alexander Kingsley showing a softer side?

Thanks to Alexander and Harrison Kingsley’s interference, Nathaniel Whitmore’s appointment as head of Vanderbilt Industries’ legal department had fallen through.

For the first time, the usually unflappable Nathaniel tasted bitter defeat. He took a week off before returning to the Lockwood residence, only to be ambushed by Adrian Lockwood, who had been waiting for him.

"Well, if it isn’t Evelyn Sinclair’s loyal lapdog," Nathaniel sneered. "Shouldn’t you be at your mistress’s beck and call? What are you doing here?"

"Adrian, don’t you have anything to say for yourself?" Adrian ignored the taunt, his voice icy.

"Who the hell do you think you’re talking to?" Nathaniel’s patience was already frayed, and Adrian’s audacity pushed him to the edge. "First Margaret, now Victoria. You’re always eager to get your hands dirty."

Adrian’s fists clenched. "Nathaniel!"

"I know you’re trying to elevate the Lockwood name, but not like this—not by betraying those who helped us!"

In a burst of fury, Adrian roared, "Where would we be without the Sinclairs? And now you’re helping the Vanderbilts turn against them? Have you lost your mind?"

"Lost my mind? I’m doing this for our family!"

Nathaniel was too blinded by anger to see his own wrongdoing. "Just because the Sinclairs helped us once, we’re supposed to be their dogs forever? That’s not how this works! If you want to grovel at Evelyn’s feet, be my guest. But Reginald and I have bigger ambitions. Not all of us dream of being some rich girl’s pet!"

That was the final straw.

With a snarl, Adrian swung a fist, landing it squarely on Nathaniel’s jaw.

In his twenty-eight years, this was the first time he had ever struck his older brother.

Once, he had admired Nathaniel.

Now, he felt nothing but shame.

Enraged, Nathaniel fought back, and the brothers brawled in the middle of the living room, shocking the household staff.

But Nathaniel was no match for Adrian and was soon pinned to the ground, taking blow after blow.

"Adrian! Stop!"

Just then, William and Eleanor Lockwood, along with Sebastian, rushed downstairs to find the brothers in a violent clash. The sight left them stunned.

Sebastian reacted first, yanking Adrian off Nathaniel and restraining him from behind.

"Adrian! Have you lost your senses? How could you hit Nathaniel?"

"He’s the one who’s lost his mind! He’s gone mad!"

Nathaniel staggered to his feet, clutching his face. "All for that Sinclair girl. He’s become a monster!"

"The monster isn’t me—it’s you, Nathaniel!" Adrian shot back, his eyes blazing.

"Enough! Both of you, silence!" William bellowed, his voice cutting through the chaos.

Eleanor, distraught at seeing her sons like this, could only wring her hands in despair.

"Adrian, I heard about Nathaniel assisting the Vanderbilts. Don’t blame him. It’s just his job as a lawyer," Sebastian said, trying to mediate.

But Adrian wasn’t having it.

"I’m leaving tonight," he declared, his face bruised but his resolve unshaken.

"Adrian! Where are you going?" Eleanor called after him, her voice trembling.

"Where else? Probably running back to his precious princess!" Nathaniel spat, his words dripping with venom.

Adrian’s fists clenched again, his knuckles cracking audibly.

If not for Sebastian holding him back, he would have lunged at Nathaniel again.

"Enough! You will not speak of her that way!" William’s voice was steel.

No one disobeyed the patriarch.

"Adrian, did you throw the first punch?" William demanded.

"Yes, Father."

"Apologize to Nathaniel. Now."

Adrian’s jaw tightened. "I’ll accept any punishment you give me. But I won’t apologize to him. If he disrespects Evelyn again, I’ll hit him again—and again—until he learns his place!"

"Adrian!" Nathaniel exploded.

William was taken aback by his usually obedient son’s fierce defense of Evelyn. His heart sank.

Just then, the butler hurried in. "Mr. Lockwood, Chairman Reginald Sinclair’s secretary is here!"

At the mention of Reginald, the room froze, the family feud momentarily forgotten.

Lawrence Bennett entered with a polite smile, though he immediately sensed the tension.

Noticing Nathaniel’s injuries, he tactfully focused on his mission. "Mr. Lockwood, Chairman Sinclair has invited your family to dinner at Silverlake Harbor. He hopes you’ll honor him with your presence. It’s been too long since he last saw the Lockwood boys."

William forced a smile. "We appreciate the invitation. We’ll be there."

Once Lawrence left, the tension returned.

"I’m not going," Nathaniel snapped. "I just got back from abroad. I’m exhausted."

William’s face darkened. "Who do you think you are? You will not snub Reginald Sinclair! Even if you have to crawl there, you will attend!"
###Chapter 252

The emerald-green Rolls-Royce glided smoothly along the winding road toward Skyrim.

Inside, laughter bubbled between the Ashbourne sisters.

Nydia's cheeks flushed pink as she clasped her hands together. "Evadne, I still can't believe you're Alea! The Alea!"

Evadne smirked, flipping her dark hair over one shoulder. "Save the hero worship. If you want jewelry, just ask."

"That's not it!" Nydia shook her head, eyes sparkling. "But... maybe Daryl could wear one of your pieces? Now that her husband is about to become President of Helgen, the First Lady should have something exquisite."

Evadne chuckled, pulling her sister close. "Alea might be a big deal to the world, but to us? Just a name. Go brag to your classmates—let them grovel at your feet."

Nydia's smile faltered slightly, thoughts drifting to the whispers at school, to Bernard's smug challenges. She bit her lip, forcing the sting away.

"I miss Daryl," Evadne murmured, resting her head against Nydia's. "Wonder if her husband's treating her right. If not, I'll turn him into mincemeat."

Nydia giggled. "No need. Cassius, Arnold, Bet, Elvis, Aaron—and Dad—would shred him first."

True. No man would be foolish enough to cross the Ashbournes.

A pause.

"Evadne... where's Jason?" Nydia finally asked, fingers twisting in her lap.

"Gave him the night off," Evadne replied airily, gaze fixed on the passing scenery.

The car rolled through the grand gates of Silveke Harbor.

As they stepped out, the Dempsey family approached—Dave and Myra with their three sons.

Evadne arched a brow. She hadn't expected Emeric to invite them.

Cedric's jaw tightened, eyes flashing with barely concealed resentment.

Jason stood slightly apart, shoulders slumped, lips pale. His voice was rough when he spoke. "Miss Evadne."

He took half a step forward—then stopped, remembering her cold dismissal days prior.

Evadne barely glanced at him.

Pitiful. Like a kicked puppy.

But hope would destroy him. Better this way.

"Mr. Dempsey," she greeted warmly.

Dave inclined his head. "Ms. Evadne. No need for formalities—though, given your position now, perhaps it's appropriate."

Evadne waved it off, but Dave insisted.

Myra studied the Ashbourne sisters—Evadne, radiant as a goddess; Nydia, demure and sweet.

Her heart ached for Jason.

Reaching for the stars, indeed.

Then her gaze settled on Nydia.

"Mrs. Dempsey!" Nydia curtsied, cheeks pink.

Myra smiled. "Ms. Nydia."

A backup plan, perhaps. Polite, gentle—though her illegitimate status was... unfortunate.

Nydia peeked at Jason, heart pounding.

His eyes, as always, were only for Evadne.

She knew that look.

She'd worn it for seven years.

Dinner at Silveke Harbor was lively—though Cassius was absent, Arnold and Aaron more than made up for it.

Emeric and Dave reminisced like old friends. Myra chatted brightly with the Ashbourne women.

But the younger generation?

Tension crackled.

With Arnold (prosecutor), Aaron (judge), and Evadne (plaintiff), the table felt like a courtroom.

Arnold swirled his wine, smirking. "Heard your firm's thriving, Cedric. Defending every high-profile criminal in Elmsworth?"

Cedric smiled thinly. "A lawyer's duty to his clients."

Aaron leaned back, assessing him like a suspect. "Strange how your clients are all wealthy or connected."

Cedric sighed dramatically. "Running a firm is expensive. I'm just trying to survive."

Arnold choked on his wine.

Jason's voice cut through, cold and sharp. "Survive? Your cheapest case this year was 200K. Highest? 1.5 million."

Silence.

Emeric and Dave turned.

Cedric's smile turned brittle. "My finances aren't dinner conversation."

Jason's laugh was icy. "Then explain why you took the Abernathy case—knowing they're Evadne's enemies."

The air froze.

Evadne finally looked at Jason, gaze piercing.

She didn't need him fighting her battles.

"Jason!" Ivan hissed, tugging his sleeve.

No use.

Cedric paled.

Dave stood abruptly. "Enough! Apologies, Emeric—my son forgets himself."

Emeric merely chuckled. "No offense taken. Jason's like a son to me. Honest, principled—qualities I admire."

A son.

The words elevated Jason—and crushed Cedric.
###Chapter 253

Nathaniel had always despised his useless younger brother, Preston.

He thought Preston spent his days pandering to women—carrying their bags, adjusting their shawls—like some glorified servant. No ambition, no backbone! But who could've predicted that Dominic, the titan of Wall Street and one of the most powerful men in New York, would publicly declare Preston his godson? It was a blatant show of support.

The worst part? Dominic showered Preston with praise in front of everyone.

Was this some twisted way of humiliating Nathaniel?

The Sinclair siblings exchanged glances. Seraphina's lips curled into a smirk, barely holding back her laughter.

Classic Dominic. Always playing the long game.

Nathaniel never expected this dinner to turn into a lion's den.

"Mr. Dominic, you're far too generous with my boy!"

Mr. and Mrs. Lockwood were stunned. Sebastian was torn between shock and delight but still tried to protest.

"Preston isn't worthy of such an honor! He should just keep working at the firm. We wouldn't dare ask for more!"

"We've known each other for years. I don't give my trust lightly." Dominic's smile was razor-sharp. "If Preston weren't exceptional, I wouldn't have chosen him. Don't you agree?"

Every word was a slap to Nathaniel's face.

His fists clenched under the table, knuckles white.

Just as he was about to excuse himself, Dominic casually remarked, "Seraphina, pass a message to Adrian when you see him."

"What is it, Father?" She rested her chin on her palm, voice honeyed.

"The proposal he submitted—the acquisition of Summit Holdings—I've approved it. He can proceed immediately."

Nathaniel froze.

A bolt of lightning couldn't have struck him harder.

Summit Holdings was the largest shareholder of his company.

If Dominic acquired it, he'd effectively own Nathaniel's empire.

The realization hit him like a freight train.

His jaw locked, eyes burning with fury. Cold sweat soaked through his tailored suit.

He couldn't bring himself to meet Dominic or Seraphina's gaze, but he felt it—sharp, predatory, dissecting him piece by piece.

This dinner wasn't a reunion.

It was a warning.

Cross his daughter, and he'd dismantle Nathaniel's world.

After dinner, the Lockwoods lingered in the lounge, chatting in small groups.

Seraphina caught up with her brothers while Sebastian and Oliver—colleagues at the firm—laughed over a game of Monopoly.

Then, a misstep.

Seraphina knocked over her wineglass.

Crimson liquid splashed across her silk dress, trailing down her legs, staining her bare feet.

"I'll clean it!" Sebastian scrambled for napkins.

"Let me!" Oliver fumbled for a towel.

"Should I—?" Adrian hesitated, then moved to help.

But before any of them could act, Preston was already there.

He dropped to his knees before Seraphina, pulling a handkerchief from his pocket. Gently, meticulously, he dabbed at the wine on her foot—as if this were nothing more than his duty as her assistant.

The room fell silent.

Natalie, mid-conversation with her mother, went rigid.

A chill slithered down her spine.

Her vision blurred. Chest aching, she whispered, "Excuse me," and fled before the tears could fall.

"Preston," Seraphina murmured, stepping back. "I need to freshen up."

And just like that, she left him kneeling—center stage, under everyone's scrutiny.
###Chapter 254

Evadne disappeared into the bathroom, washing away the day's exhaustion. She changed into a fresh dress, hoping the night air would clear her thoughts.

That memory haunted her - Jason on his knees, tenderly wiping spilled wine from her feet before everyone. His devotion had always been unwavering.

But after that soul-searing embrace, she couldn't meet his gaze anymore. Their childhood bond had shifted into something she couldn't recognize.

Was she just a sister figure to him? Or had his heart harbored deeper desires all along?

The weight of it suffocated her.

"Miss Evadne?"

She startled at Jason's voice. He stood rigidly nearby, complexion pale. "You're still awake?" she asked.

"I was concerned about you." His throat worked as he stepped closer. "It's been a week. Why won't you let me resume my duties?"

"Because you needed time to think." She spun lightly, leaning against the wall. "Well? Have you reached a conclusion?"

His confession came in a tremble. "I love you. Hate me if you must, but you can't stop these feelings. I never expected reciprocation, but is loving someone a crime?"

Her eyes sharpened.

"My feelings won't overstep," he continued with forced brightness. "I know my place."

"You've done nothing wrong," she said bitterly. If unrequited love was sin, then her heartbreak with Thaddeus made her the greatest sinner.

"The part of me that could love is dead, Jason. Find someone who can return your affections."

She'd shattered countless hearts, yet gentleness softened her words for him.

"You'll find real love too," Jason choked out, eyes reddening.

"Foolishness doesn't bear repeating." She waved dismissively. "Money never betrays you. Long live solitude!"

"Then may I return to your service?" His earnest gaze pleaded. "This week's idleness has been torture."

She extended her hand regally. "Serve your queen, knight."

Joy ignited his features. Instead of kneeling, he bowed and pressed a reverent kiss to her knuckles. "My life is yours to command."

Their shared smile spoke volumes.

In the shadows, Nydia stood frozen. Each beat of her heart sent fresh agony through her chest. She'd thought herself resigned to Jason's devotion to her sister.

Witnessing this intimacy shattered that illusion. Tears streamed silently as she retreated into darkness. Nothing compared to watching the man you love cherish another.

"Speaking of which," Evadne flicked Jason's forehead, "what possessed you tonight? Switching sides so dramatically? Cedric's your brother - you can't disregard family for my sake."

"Your stance is mine," he stated firmly.

"Such brotherly devotion!" She teased, arms crossed.

"Miss Evadne!" He flushed, recalling Emeric's public acknowledgment of him. "That was merely Chairman Emeric pressuring Cedric! I'd be delusional to take it seriously!"

"Underestimate Emeric at your peril. His word is law. Though unscrupulous, he'd never use family as pawns." She patted his shoulder. "Relax - being an honorary son beats bastard status, no?"

Jason nearly choked.

Meanwhile, Nydia stumbled through the mansion's labyrinthine halls. Alcohol and anguish blurred her vision. The sprawling estate had become a maze.

"Jason," she whispered between ragged breaths.

Her foot caught. As she pitched forward, strong hands steadied her. Even through her haze, his resemblance to Jason made her pulse race.

"Careful, Miss Nydia."

"Jason..."

A chuckle. "I'm Cedric. Jason's brother."

The realization sobered her instantly. "Let go of me."
###Chapter 255

This was a first for Isabella—being held so intimately by a man. Her cheeks burned as she squirmed in Nathaniel's arms.

Her legs felt weak, but she managed to press her palms against his chest, trying to push him away.

"Oh? So only my little brother gets to hold you?" Nathaniel's dark eyes traced the delicate curves of Isabella's flushed face. "Do you have feelings for him?"

The way her forehead glistened with a faint sheen of sweat, the enticing pink blooming across her cheeks—it all painted a picture of innocence and allure that made him want to tease her even more.

The Sinclair family was known for their striking genes. Each of Alexander's wives had possessed their own unique beauty, but the most breathtaking of them all had been Seraphina.

And Isabella had inherited her mother's ethereal grace, her skin glowing with youthful radiance.

Nathaniel was only human. His pulse quickened at the sight of such beauty.

"No, that's not it!" Isabella's face turned even redder.

"Then let me take you to rest." His grip around her slender waist didn't loosen.

"No, Mr. Nathaniel. I can manage on my own."

"You can barely stand. Don't push yourself."

Nathaniel leaned in closer, his face mere inches from hers—close enough to kiss. If not for Isabella's hands braced against his chest, their bodies would have been pressed flush together. "When we were kids, it wasn't just Sebastian who saw you. You don’t need to be so formal with me. Just call me Nathaniel."

"Miss Isabella!"

A sharp voice snapped her back to reality.

If Sebastian hadn’t arrived when he did, Nathaniel might have taken advantage of the moment. He had been so close to stealing a kiss! His little brother always ruined everything.

Nathaniel quickly schooled his expression into one of innocence and steadied Isabella. His cold gaze settled on Sebastian.

"Miss Isabella, why are you with my brother?" Sebastian's voice wavered, his eyes dark with concern.

From his angle, it had looked like Nathaniel was about to kiss her—and she hadn’t been resisting.

His throat tightened as if stuffed with cotton.

Isabella's heart fluttered. She rubbed her eyes, disoriented.

"Miss Isabella, answer me!" Sebastian demanded, stepping forward urgently.

Nathaniel's expression darkened as he shielded a pale Isabella. "Miss Isabella had too much to drink and nearly fell. I happened to be nearby and helped her. Is there a problem?"

"Did you really just help her?" Sebastian gritted his teeth.

The memory of Nathaniel's hungry gaze made his stomach twist.

"What are you implying?" Nathaniel scoffed, feigning offense. "You make it sound like I’m some beast in gentleman’s clothing. I’m a lawyer. I know the law. This is Miss Isabella’s home, and the Sinclairs are here. What exactly could I do?"

He smirked, adding pointedly, "Unlike you—already Chairman Alexander’s godson and Miss Arabella’s favorite. You can do whatever you want. I’ll take care of Miss Isabella. You go tend to your precious mistress."

With that, Nathaniel turned back to Isabella, his gaze softening with false affection.

Sebastian was so furious he couldn’t even speak. His fingers clenched, knuckles white.

"Nathaniel."

Seeing the brothers on the verge of arguing, Isabella weakly intervened. "I’m fine now. I’ve sobered up. Let’s go to the front hall."

"Of course. I’ll accompany you."

Just as they turned to leave, Sebastian couldn’t take it anymore. Eyes burning, he lunged forward and seized Isabella’s delicate wrist.

"Ah!" She winced at the sudden pressure.

"Miss Isabella, come with me."

Sebastian pulled her to his side, wrapping an arm protectively around her shoulders, forcing her to follow him.

Isabella’s heart ached. She kept her head bowed, tears shimmering in her eyes.

She didn’t want to go with him—but she couldn’t deny the part of her that still longed to be near him.

What was she supposed to do?

She still loved Sebastian so much.

Nathaniel didn’t chase after them. He wouldn’t risk his reputation over a woman.

Watching Sebastian and Isabella walk away—a perfect match—and recalling the fire in Sebastian’s eyes as he fought for her, Nathaniel suddenly realized something. A slow, sinister smile curled his lips.

"If you can be Chairman Alexander’s godson, why can’t I become President Sinclair’s son-in-law?"

Sebastian took Isabella straight to her room and firmly shut the door behind them.

"Ugh, I feel awful..." Isabella collapsed onto the couch, her chest rising and falling with labored breaths.

She had sobered slightly, but the sudden movement made her head spin again.

Sebastian had been seething, but seeing her discomfort dissolved his anger.

"Why did you drink so much? You know you can’t handle alcohol."

He sighed, shaking his head, then quickly poured her a glass of water. "Miss Isabella, sit up and drink this."

"I don’t want to. I don’t feel like it."

She turned away, her voice thick with resentment. "Just go. I want to rest."

"You can’t sleep here. You’ll catch a cold."

"I don’t need your concern. Go take care of my sister!" Isabella curled into herself, lashing out in a fit of drunken pique.

Sebastian froze, a dull ache spreading through his chest.

Without another word, he scooped her up and carried her to the bedroom.

"Sebastian—put me down!" Her heart hammered wildly.

Her legs dangled, and her fluffy slippers slipped off, revealing delicate, bare feet.

Sebastian’s gaze flickered downward instinctively.

The sight of her pale, dainty feet hit him like a punch to the gut. A sinful heat rushed through him. He quickly looked away, throat dry, pulse erratic.

Gently, he laid her on the bed and tucked her in.

"Miss Isabella. Good night."

But Isabella, in her drunken haze, suddenly grabbed his hand with surprising strength.

With a sharp tug, she pulled him off balance—and he landed on top of her.

Their chests pressed together. Noses brushed.

And then—

Their lips met.

Sebastian’s eyes widened in shock. His body trembled, blood roaring in his ears.

It was sweet.

So unbearably sweet.

Isabella, half-conscious, wrapped her arms around his neck, deepening the kiss.

Outside, the night was soft, the crescent moon smirking down at them.

The dinner had ended on an uneasy note, thanks to Nathaniel.

The Vanderbilt family left in three cars. On the way back, Reginald said coldly, "Sebastian, ride with your mother. I need to speak with Nathaniel."

Nathaniel scowled but followed his father into the car.

Sebastian sat with his mother in the backseat while Preston took the passenger side.

Under the dim car light, Mrs. Vanderbilt noticed Sebastian’s flushed cheeks, distant gaze, and rapid breathing.

"Sebastian, are you feeling unwell? Do you have a fever?" She always worried over her youngest son.

"Huh? Mom, what did you say?" Sebastian blinked, still dazed.

It was as if he hadn’t fully returned from that kiss.

"Sebastian, why is your face so red?"

Preston smirked through the rearview mirror. "Did you finally kiss your first love? I remember looking exactly like that after my first kiss."

"Preston, shut up."

Sebastian coughed, his face burning hotter. "Mom, I’m fine. Don’t worry. Tomorrow morning, I’ll pick up Miss Isabella and return to Elmsworth. My break is over. It’s time to get back to work."

Mrs. Vanderbilt remembered how her beloved son had humbly washed Arabella’s feet in front of everyone. It made her uneasy. "Sebastian, why did you leave a promising position as President Sinclair’s secretary to work for Miss Arabella? The Sinclair fortune will still go to the eldest son, won’t it?"

"Mom, haven’t you seen the news? Miss Arabella is a sensation in Elmsworth. They call her the 'Billionaire Heiress.' I think she’s just as capable as President Sinclair," Preston chimed in.

"Only because her father is Alexander. She can do whatever she wants without consequences!" Mrs. Vanderbilt muttered bitterly.

"Mom, Miss Arabella treats me well. I’m happy working for her."

Sebastian took his mother’s hand, his gaze intense. "Most importantly, she needs me. No matter how hard it gets, I’ll stay by her side—unless she no longer wants me."

Mrs. Vanderbilt stiffened, feeling as if her son had chosen another woman over her.

Preston nearly choked. That had sounded like a love confession.

"Son, do you really think Arabella returns your feelings?"

Mrs. Vanderbilt was convinced Arabella had bewitched him with her beauty. She needed to save him from this "trap." "You’re our pride, Sebastian! Look at what you’ve been doing since you started following Arabella! Even if our family owes the Sinclairs, she has no right to disrespect you like this!"

Seeing his mother on the verge of tears, Sebastian pulled her into a hug.

"Mom, you’re overthinking it. Miss Arabella is a good person. She’s never demanded anything from me. Everything I do for her, I do willingly."

Meanwhile, in the other car, the tension was just as thick.

"From now on, stay away from the Sinclairs!" Reginald snapped. "I raised you to remember your roots, not to be ungrateful! Money isn’t everything. You’re already a billionaire—what more do you want? Why provoke the Abernathys and make trouble for the Sinclairs?"

"What did I do wrong? It’s the Sinclairs who are overbearing!"

Nathaniel, still fuming over the night’s humiliation, clenched his jaw. "Arabella must have tattled to Alexander. He’s trying to take over my law firm by investing in Pinnacle Ventures! I won’t let that little witch win. I’ll make sure she falls hard."

"You’re still not listening!"

Reginald’s face reddened with fury. "I’m your father, and everything I say is for your own good! The Sinclairs aren’t like the Abernathys—all smiles on the outside but scheming behind closed doors. No one knows better than me how united that family is. If you provoke them, you’ll only bring ruin upon yourself!"

Nathaniel remained defiant, convinced his father was exaggerating.

"Don’t drag your brothers into your mess!"

After resolving his inner turmoil, Sebastian returned to work with Arabella.

Though his first love had ended in melancholy, it had brought him clarity.

But one thing still haunted him.

That night—when Isabella, drunk and dazed, had kissed him so deeply.

"Sebastian? Sebastian! The pan is burning!"

Arabella’s shout snapped him out of his thoughts. He blinked—the frying pan in front of him was billowing black smoke.

"Oh no!"

He hastily turned off the stove and tossed the ruined pan into the sink.

"What’s wrong with you? You’ve been distracted for days—did a ghost possess you?"

Arabella rushed over, checking him for injuries first.

"Sorry, Miss Arabella. I just didn’t sleep well. I’ll make you another one."

His heart pounded as he moved to clean up, but Arabella stopped him.

"No need. We’re short on time. Let’s eat out." She paused. "Oh, and take me to Misty Mountain Park this afternoon. I need to meet Professor Leo."
###Chapter 256

The afternoon sun cast long shadows as Isabella Sinclair swapped her usual limousine for an unassuming sedan. Daniel Carter rode shotgun, his gaze flickering between the winding road and the woman beside him.

Thirteen years ago, she'd nearly died in these very mountains searching for her mother's lost belongings.

Most would've been traumatized.

But not Isabella.

She wasn't the type to admit defeat—not even to herself.

Instead of developing a fear of nature, she'd made it a ritual to return every year with Professor Henri Delacroix, patrolling the forest, rescuing stranded hikers.

At first, the seasoned rangers had scoffed at the idea of this delicate-looking woman keeping up. They'd even placed bets on how quickly she'd quit.

She proved them all wrong.

No challenge was too harsh, no terrain too brutal. Her determination outmatched even the toughest men.

Daniel watched her in the rearview mirror—dressed in full mountaineering gear, face bare of makeup.

Stripped of her usual elegance, she looked every bit the warrior, radiating quiet strength.

"Ms. Sinclair, climbing alone is dangerous. Let me come with you," Daniel urged, concern tightening his voice.

Isabella cracked one eye open. "Do you own climbing gear? Know safety protocols? Have any actual experience?"

"I've surfed big waves! Scuba dived!" He grinned, eager to impress.

She clicked her tongue. "Changing the subject?"

Daniel flushed. "Wouldn't dream of arguing with you."

"And if we run into trouble? You'll dive into a lake?" She smirked. "Not a bad plan. You're pretty enough—maybe a mermaid will kidnap you as her groom."

He laughed, absurdly pleased by the backhanded compliment.

The car rolled to a stop at the forest's edge. Ahead, Misty Mountain loomed—jagged peaks wreathed in shifting fog.

Daniel gulped. "That's... steep."

"Eloquent." Isabella rolled her eyes. "It's rugged. The kind of mountain that demands respect."

Before he could respond, a voice called out.

"Isabella!"

Her heart leapt. Professor Henri approached, flanked by Captain Nathaniel Whitmore.

The sight of him hit like a punch to the chest.

Illness had whittled the once-vibrant man to a shadow. His cheeks were hollow, his frame frail.

She swallowed the lump in her throat and rushed forward, wrapping him in a fierce hug.

"You're looking well," she lied smoothly.

"Never better!" Henri beamed.

Captain Nathaniel looked away, jaw tight.

Isabella inhaled sharply. She knew the symptoms—the nausea, the pain, the slow erosion of dignity.

Her eyes flicked to Daniel. A nearly imperceptible nod passed between them. The specialist is arranged.

Henri studied Daniel curiously.

"My cousin," Isabella supplied breezily. The rangers lived far from society's buzz; they'd never connect her to the Sinclair dynasty.

"Your family breeds beauty, Ms. Sinclair!" Nathaniel chuckled.

Daniel preened.

Henri's smile faded. "You shouldn't climb today. The weather—"

"Since when do I back down?" She thumped her chest. "I earned that 'Mountain Goddess' title, didn't I?"

Henri laughed. "We've got two deities here! How blessed we are."

Isabella arched a brow. "Who's the impostor?"

"Alexander Kingsley," Nathaniel announced, eyes shining. "CEO of Vanderbilt Group. Found out his identity years late—man climbs like a pro. Saved two hikers during a storm, used his private chopper for evacuation. They call him the Mountain God."

One mountain, two gods?

Isabella's lips thinned. Memories surged—Alexander pulling her from the abyss thirteen years ago.

They'd both returned every year since.

Patrolled the same trails.

Saved lives.

Donated generously.

Yet never crossed paths.

Fate's a cruel jester.

She forced a grin. "How... noble of him."

Henri nudged her. "I'd hoped to introduce you two. You'd get along famously."

"Social anxiety," she deadpanned.

After shooing Daniel away, Isabella followed Henri and Nathaniel toward the basecamp, lost in thought.

Why did Alexander haunt her even here?

Their footsteps crunched on gravel when frantic shouts erupted.

"Professor! Distress call—three hikers separated on the summit! Two made it back; one's still up there!"

Henri moved instantly. "I'll lead the team."

"The weather's turning—" Nathaniel protested.

"I'm fine!"

Isabella stepped forward. "Let me go. I've field medic training—can stabilize the victim if needed."

Nathaniel's eyes widened with newfound respect.

Henri squeezed her hand. "Bring them home safe."

Meanwhile, Alexander Kingsley's SUV rolled through the park gates.

Dressed in tactical gear, he looked less like a CEO and more like a special forces operative.

"Henri!" He clasped the professor's bony shoulders. "You shouldn't be out here."

Henri chuckled. "Says the workaholic who flew in between board meetings."

Alexander's gaze darkened. "I've set up a conservation fund under my assistant's name. The donations won't stop, even if..."

"Enough gloom!" Henri swatted him. "Today's special—both my favorite protégés are here!"

Alexander stilled. "Who else visited?"

"A remarkable young woman. Like you, she volunteers here annually. Donates. Saves lives."

Normally, Alexander would've tuned out. But something in Henri's tone snagged his attention.

"I'd like to meet her."

"Ah, bad timing—she's on the mountain now for the rescue!"

Henri sighed. "Isabella would've liked you."

Isabella.

The name detonated in Alexander's chest.

His pulse roared. Every nerve lit up as if electrocuted.

Gripping Henri's arm, he rasped, "Her surname—is it Sinclair?"

Henri blinked. "You know her?"

Thirteen years of near-misses.

Of parallel lives.

Of almosts.

Alexander's voice dropped to a whisper.

"Tell me everything."
###Chapter 257

Crash!

The sky turned an eerie shade of gray, rumbling with a deafening crack of thunder.

The bolt seemed to strike right at Alexander Kingsley, freezing him in place.

Only his heart pounded violently, a storm of emotions raging within him.

"Professor Henri," Alexander's voice was strained, barely audible over the wind, "how long has Ms. Isabella been assisting you with patrols?"

"Nearly three years now," Professor Henri replied. "She's been invaluable."

Three years.

The exact length of time since he and Isabella had married.

Alexander's chest tightened painfully.

A bitter taste rose in his throat, nearly choking him.

All this time, she had been hiding the truth, doing the same thing he had been doing.

But he had his reasons.

What were hers?

His head throbbed as confusion threatened to consume him.

"Storm's coming," Professor Henri muttered, glancing at the darkening sky before radioing Captain Daniel. "Be careful out there, Daniel! Especially with Isabella."

"Copy that, professor."

Alexander turned sharply and strode toward the entrance of the Misty Ridge trail.

"Mr. Kingsley! Where are you going?" Professor Henri called after him.

Alexander didn't stop.

His answer burned silently in his mind—to find her.

The sky had turned an ominous charcoal, thunder growling like a beast.

Though it was midday, the world had plunged into near darkness.

"Who in their right mind hikes in this weather?" one of the team members grumbled as they trudged forward.

"No use complaining now," Captain Daniel snapped, his voice barely audible over the howling wind. "Our job is to bring everyone back safely."

"Captain Daniel! Over here!" Isabella's voice cut through the storm as she pointed at something wedged between jagged rocks.

"That's the missing hiker's phone. We're close!" Captain Daniel announced grimly.

"Split up! Isabella and Group A, with me. Group B, head west!"

"Yes, Captain!"

Despite her rain gear, Isabella was drenched, shivering violently. The wind lashed at them, making every step a battle.

Misty Ridge was a labyrinth of treacherous slopes and hidden cliffs.

"Help... please, someone..."

"I hear her!" Isabella froze, her sharp ears catching the faint cry. "She's nearby!"

The team exchanged surprised glances.

This elegant woman wasn't just a pretty face—she had the instincts of a seasoned rescuer.

"Isabella, be careful!" Captain Daniel warned as she moved toward the voice.

Her flashlight flickered as desperate pleas echoed in her ears. Her pulse raced.

Once, she had been the one lost in the mountains, praying for salvation.

Now, she was the savior.

After several heart-stopping moments, they found the stranded hiker.

"Stay calm! We're here to help!" Isabella shouted over the storm.

"Can you move?" she asked, but the woman could only shake her head weakly.

"Hold on! I'm coming down!"

"No, Isabella! It's too dangerous!"

But she was already descending, her movements swift and sure despite the perilous terrain. She reached the woman and pulled her close.

"My ankle... I can't..." the hiker whimpered.

"We're getting you out of here," Isabella promised firmly.

She secured a rope around the woman's waist, her fingers numb from the cold.

Then—

The ground trembled beneath them.

"Damn it! Landslide! Pull them up, NOW!"

Captain Daniel, drenched in sweat, yanked the rope with all his strength.

But the mud was shifting uncontrollably beneath his feet.

"We can't hold on, Captain! We'll all be dragged down!"

"Captain! We have to choose—we can only save one!"

"Captain! We need to retreat before it's too late!"

As they shouted, a torrent of mud and debris surged toward them like a monstrous wave.

With a final desperate heave, Captain Daniel roared—

And in the last second before impact, they hauled one figure to safety.

"Captain! We've got the hiker! She's alive!"

"Captain! Ms. Sinclair—she's gone!"

At those words, Captain Daniel's vision darkened.

The landslide had spared the hikers, but now they had to evacuate the injured.

"Half of you, get them to base camp! The rest—with me! We're finding Isabella!"

His eyes burned with determination, fists clenched. "Call in backup! Now!"

"Captain... do you think she was buried?"

"Or... did she fall?"

The team bowed their heads, hope fading.

"Don't you dare say that!" Captain Daniel snarled. "Isabella's a fighter. She'll make it!"

But even as he spoke, his voice cracked.

Three years ago, a ranger had died in a landslide.

He knew the odds.

And yet—

"Captain! Someone's there!"

Through the storm, a figure emerged—tall, unyielding, clad in a dark green climbing suit.

"Alexander...?"

"It's Mr. Kingsley!"

Rain streamed down Alexander's face, his piercing gaze like a hawk's in the night.

His presence alone seemed to shift the very air around them.

"Where is Isabella?" His voice was raw, his eyes bloodshot.

"She saved a hiker... but the landslide took her," Captain Daniel said bluntly. "We don't know if she's alive."

Alexander paled, his broad frame trembling.

The pain was a gaping wound in his chest.

No. Not Isabella. Not like this.

She still owed him answers.

He hadn't atoned for the pain he'd caused her.

She couldn't die.

He wouldn't let her.

He needed her—alive, breathing, his.

With a roar of fury, Alexander charged into the storm.
###Chapter 258

The world blurred into chaos—torrential rain, shattered rocks, thick mud, choking smoke.

These were the last things Isabella Sinclair saw before darkness swallowed her consciousness.

But with her final ounce of strength, she shoved the climber to safety.

Even if the odds were slim, she wanted her to live.

If she hadn’t been ready to face danger, she never should have worn that uniform. Death didn’t scare her. As long as her sacrifice meant something, her turbulent journey wouldn’t be wasted.

She hadn’t always been this fearless. As a child, even the thought of death—or her father and stepmothers dragging her to a psychic—would send her into hysterics. She’d been a dramatic little thing.

But at eleven, she met him here.

His courage, his resilience, those piercing eyes that guided her like a lighthouse in a storm—how he’d been willing to live or die with her in that fleeting moment—it had seared into her soul.

For the first time, she realized a person could burn so fiercely for themselves.

Even after marrying him, even after he shattered her, she couldn’t deny it.

Alexander Kingsley changed her. He rewrote her life.

Time twisted. Stars realigned.

Everything happened too fast—an avalanche of fate.

In the brief darkness, Isabella dreamed.

She dreamed of curling under her parents’ knees, her brothers celebrating her birthday.

Sebastian lifted her onto a mountain of gift boxes, Oliver sang a horribly off-key Happy Birthday, Arabella held the cake as they blew out candles together, and William gave her the toy gun she’d always wanted.

And Alexander.

She remembered fighting beside him on the battlefield, life hanging by a thread.

She remembered seeing him again at her grandfather’s side, unable to look away.

She remembered him sliding divorce papers across the table, his expression ice-cold.

A sharp pain tore through her chest, jolting her awake.

Isabella gasped, choking on air, drenched in sweat and rain. Her body trembled violently. “I’m alive? I’m alive!”

Tears spilled as she squeezed her eyes shut.

If not for that dream of the bastard who broke her, she might’ve died confused and unaware.

But her relief shattered when she saw where she was.

She’d been washed onto a hillside by the mudslide, half-buried, her backpack dangling from a fragile branch.

“Damn it! Just my luck!”

She forced steady breaths, teeth gritted. “I can’t die. Not now. What would happen to William? To my brothers?” If fate gave her this chance, she’d claw her way back.

Crack.

The branch above her groaned.

Isabella froze. One wrong move, and it would snap.

She dug her fingers into the mud, found two sturdy rocks, and flipped herself onto them just as the branch gave way—plunging into the abyss below.

Her heart hammered against her ribs.

No time to panic. She had to climb.

Night had fallen, the storm relentless.

Rain stung her eyes, her hands numb from cold. Only sheer will kept her moving.

Isabella’s mother had died young, leaving her to be raised by her stepmothers. Aviana had trained her in boxing, horseback riding, archery—and climbing.

That skill was saving her now.

Just as she neared the top, the ground trembled.

Pebbles skittered past her. Another landslide.

“Seriously, God? After all my charity work? This is how you repay me?”

The rock beneath her foot crumbled.

She hung in midair, nothing but emptiness below.

“No! HELP!”

Her eyes flew wide—despair crashed over her.

One misstep, and death waited.

A tear of defiance slipped free as she shut her eyes.

“Isabella!”

A rough hand clamped around her wrist, yanking her back from the edge.

Her fall jerked to a stop.

Slowly, she opened her eyes.

Alexander’s gaze met hers—bright as starlight.

Her breath hitched.

“Alexander?”

Was this a dream? A hallucination?

Her pulse roared in her ears.

“Don’t be scared. I’ve got you.”

His voice was raw, his grip iron-tight. Sweat streaked his face, his left hand dug into the mud, his right trembling as he held her.

But the ground was giving way beneath him too.

They could both die here.

“Alexander!”

His name tore from her lips, tears spilling unbidden. “I don’t want to die.”

She’d been so strong until now—pushing past every limit.

But seeing him shattered her defenses.

The fearless girl was crying.

Pain darkened Alexander’s eyes, his blood screaming for her.

“Cry later. Right now, give me everything you’ve got and CLIMB!”

She sucked in a breath, teeth clenched, hauling herself up with him.

“Hurry! It’s collapsing!” he barked.

“I KNOW! I’m going as fast as I can!” she snapped back, tears blurring her vision.

Alexander frowned.

Terrified—yet somehow even more endearing.

Lightning flashed, illuminating her face.

A sudden, searing pain split his skull.

Through the haze, Isabella morphed into a girl of eleven or twelve.

A voice—familiar yet distant—echoed in his mind.

“Little girl, what’s your name?”

“Won’t tell me? Fine. I’ll call you Tiny. Tiny body, tiny mouth, tiny nose.”

Alexander’s breath caught.

Memories surged—long buried, now crashing over him like a tidal wave.

Tiny. Tiny!

She was the girl he’d saved all those years ago.

The one who’d nearly died right here.
###Chapter 259

The ground beneath Alexander crumbled without warning.

There was no time to process the shock.

The cliff was giving way beneath his feet.

"Serena!"

The name tore from his lips before he could stop it—a name he hadn't uttered in over a decade.

Isabella's breath hitched.

That single word sent an electric jolt through her, propelling her forward. She lunged for Alexander just as the edge collapsed beneath him.

Her fingers closed around his wrist.

With a desperate yank, she pulled him into her arms as the ground vanished beneath them.

A deafening crash.

Alexander twisted midair, shielding Isabella with his body as they tumbled down the slope. Rocks bit into his back, but he didn't loosen his grip.

They skidded to a stop just short of a sheer drop.

A sharp gasp escaped him as pain lanced through his ribs.

"Are you hurt?" Isabella pushed herself up, rainwater dripping from her lashes as she searched his face.

"No." His voice was steady, betraying nothing.

She exhaled shakily, her body sagging against his.

The storm raged around them.

"Why didn't you tell me?" Alexander's voice was rough, his gaze burning into hers.

"Tell you what?" Her pulse stuttered.

"That our first meeting wasn't three years ago." His fingers tightened around her arms. "That it was thirteen years ago, on this very mountain. That you were the girl I saved that day."

Isabella went still.

He remembered.

That name—Serena—hadn't been spoken in years. Not since that stormy afternoon when a boy with piercing eyes had pulled her from the river and christened her with it.

Her throat tightened.

Too late.

It was all too late.

"Tell me, Isabella." His grip on her chin forced her to meet his gaze. "Why did you marry me under that name?"

A bitter laugh escaped her. "You remember that too, then."

His jaw clenched.

Of course he remembered.

He'd asked for her name that day. When she hadn't answered, he'd given her one—Serena. A fleeting moment, forgotten by morning.

Until she walked back into his life years later, wearing it like a ghost.

"You didn't need to remember," she whispered. "I never expected you to. I was just a stranger you helped once. Thirteen years ago, three years ago—it doesn't change anything."

Alexander flinched.

Guilt twisted in his chest. He'd saved her, yes. But he'd also forgotten her.

While she—

While she had carried that memory like a secret.

"I'm sorry." The words scraped raw from his throat. "If I'd known—"

"You still would have divorced me." Her smile was hollow. "A name doesn't change who we are. And you don't owe me anything. If anything, I should be thanking you. You saved me and left before I could."

"Then why?" His voice broke. "Why marry me at all?"

The question had haunted him for months.

"Does it matter now?" She turned her face away. "It's over. Let it go."

A shudder ran through her.

The rain had soaked through her clothes, leaving her trembling.

Alexander exhaled sharply.

Truce.

For now.

He helped her up, ignoring the protest of his own injuries.

No signal. No way to call for help.

"We're on the wrong side of the mountain," Isabella panted, stumbling forward. "No one comes out here."

Exhaustion dragged at her limbs.

Alexander caught her before she could fall.

"Gordon sent a search team," he said grimly. "But in this weather..."

Her knees buckled.

He caught her, her weight collapsing against him. The scent of damp earth clung to her hair.

How long had she been out here before he found her?

"We need shelter."

He lifted her into his arms, ignoring the pain in his ribs.

"Alexander." Her voice was faint against his shoulder.

"We're getting out of here."

"But what if—"

"I heard they call you the mountain goddess." A faint smirk touched his lips despite everything. "Funny. They call me the mountain god."

She scoffed.

"Then trust me, Isabella." His grip tightened around her. "If fate won't spare you, I will."

Her cold fingers curled into his shirt.

And for the first time in years, she let herself believe him.
###Chapter 260

His fingers curled around her limp pinky, cradling it with a gentleness that sent unfamiliar warmth flooding through her veins.

The sensation was electric, like dormant nerves sparking back to life.

Isabella Sinclair exhaled softly, pressing her forehead against the solid expanse of his back. The chill in her hands melted beneath his touch, her fingers instinctively curling into his palm.

Alexander Kingsley's pulse stuttered. He braced for her to recoil, to pull away—so he tightened his grip.

"Stay still," he commanded, voice rough. The gash on his back burned, but he swallowed the pain.

He wouldn't let her see.

Not now.

Not when, for the first time in years, she leaned on him without resistance.

"Ugh, it's freezing," she mumbled, breath fogging in the air.

"Hold on. We'll find shelter." His lungs heaved, every step a battle.

"And if we don't?" Her voice was featherlight, exhaustion dragging at each word.

"Then you'll stay in my arms." The words tumbled out, raw and unguarded.

"No!" Her lashes fluttered wildly. "I'm not letting you take liberties!"

A smirk tugged at his lips. The fire in her protest sent adrenaline surging through him. He adjusted his grip, savoring her weight. She wasn't escaping him now.

Their breaths tangled, hearts hammering in unison.

Thirteen years collapsed between them.

The girl he'd carried then was a woman now.

His wife. For three years.

Meanwhile, Nathaniel Whitmore fought through the storm toward the campsite.

Rain lashed his usually pristine suit, mud caking his shoes. "Miss Isabella!"

He collided with Professor Laurent and Preston Walsh, both clad in rain gear.

"That damn secretary," Preston muttered under his breath.

"Why are you here?" Nathaniel's gut twisted. "Where's Miss Isabella?"

"Mr. Whitmore, calm down!" Preston's voice cracked. "Mr. Kingsley and the rangers are searching the mountain. Three helicopters are en route. He swore he wouldn't return without her!"

Nathaniel staggered.

Since when did the ice-cold Alexander Kingsley make vows for anyone?

"This is my fault." Professor Laurent clawed at his chest. "I never should've let her go up there."

"Stop that! Mr. Kingsley is unstoppable—"

Nathaniel wasn't listening. His hands shook as he dialed Sebastian Sinclair.

The call connected instantly. "Nathaniel. What's wrong with Isabella?"

Sebastian's voice was razor-sharp. He'd felt the unease all night.

"Sir!" Nathaniel's throat closed. "Miss Isabella's in danger. Send help to Misty Mountain Park immediately!"

Sebastian was 350 kilometers away in Azeroth City's military base when the call came.

He'd been visiting his brother, Oliver Sinclair—the firstborn of the quadruplets, now a decorated colonel. Their reunions were rare.

"Oliver." Sebastian's knuckles whitened around the phone. "Isabella's in trouble. I'm leaving now."

"What?" Oliver shot up from the sofa, uniform crisp, composure shattered. "What happened?"

"Our little sister went back to that damned forest." Sebastian's jaw clenched. "She never listens."

Oliver paced, fists tight. His soldiers would've gaped at the uncharacteristic display.

"Donating millions wasn't enough? She had to play hero?"

Sebastian shot him a look. "Remember when she was eleven?"

Oliver's face darkened. "That Abernathy boy ruined her."

"We were born first to protect her," Sebastian said grimly, striding toward the door. "I can't waste time."

"Wait." Oliver snatched his cap from the sofa. "I'm coming."

After an eternity, Alexander found a shallow cave.

He lowered Isabella against the wall. She trembled violently, arms locked across her chest. Her lips were bloodless, cheeks flushed with fever.

Yet her eyes still gleamed defiantly in the gloom.

His stomach lurched when he touched her burning skin. "You're feverish."

"I'll live," she slurred, too weak to resist his cool hands.

He stripped off his jacket and shirt, bundling them around her.

"Still cold?"

"Freezing," she admitted through chattering teeth.

Alexander hesitated—then pulled her against his bare chest, rubbing warmth into her back.

"Better?"

She nuzzled into his neck, breath hot on his skin.

His arms tightened. Fingers threaded through her hair. He needed her to feel safe.

"Isabella," he rasped, pressing her palm to his pounding heart. "Why did you marry me? Was it just... gratitude?"

Her whisper ghosted over his collarbone. "I loved you."

His breath caught.

"I always dreamed of being your wife."

"Do you still?" His voice broke. "Love me?"

She studied their tangled fingers—then slowly pulled away.

"I don't hate you anymore." Her eyes shuttered. "But I don't love you either."
###Chapter 261

Isabella couldn't fool herself. The words left a dull ache in her chest as they escaped her lips.

This pain was familiar. During her three-year marriage to Alexander, this heartache had been more constant than his presence. She'd grown accustomed to it.

"Alexander, why ask these questions now?" Her voice cracked slightly. "Do you really think I'd stay and wait for you after everything?"

Her crystal-like eyes narrowed, revealing a rare vulnerability that made his chest tighten. "I loved you for thirteen years. How many sets of thirteen years does one get in a lifetime? I can't love anymore. I'm terrified of you."

The unspoken thought lingered between them: She wasn't just afraid of him - she feared love itself.

Alexander felt like he'd been stabbed. His lips lost all color as emotions clogged his throat, making breathing difficult.

A horrifying realization struck him - he'd reached new depths of selfishness.

Their sham marriage hadn't just wasted her time; it had nearly broken her spirit.

"Isabella, are you serious?" His voice was raw, knowing he was begging for humiliation.

"When have I ever lied to you?" A bitter laugh escaped her, light as air but heavy with meaning. "When I said I loved you, I meant it. When I said I didn't want a divorce, I was sincere. Every tear I shed for you was real. So when I say I don't love you anymore - that's the truth too."

"Isabella." His bloodshot eyes burned as he grabbed her hand again. Despite her fever, her fingers were ice-cold against his skin.

No matter how tightly he held on, he couldn't warm them.

"Alexander, I appreciate you saving my life." Her words were clinical, putting emotional distance between them. "You've saved me again, and I owe you. In the future, within reason, I'll repay this debt."

The message was clear - after this, she wanted nothing more to do with him.

Before Alexander could respond, Isabella slumped against his shoulder, her breathing evening out in sleep.

Flushed cheeks. Fluttering lashes. A sheen of sweat on her forehead. In his arms, she looked like a peaceful, vulnerable child.

His heart hammered against his ribs as he pulled her closer.

Once, he'd had countless chances to hold her like this.

Now, these stolen moments were all he had left.

He'd brought this upon himself.

The walkie-talkie remained silent. No cell signal.

Though part of him longed to stay trapped here with her forever, her worsening fever couldn't wait. If they stayed overnight, complications could arise.

Anxiety gnawed at him as he repeatedly checked her temperature with his palm.

He needed to cool her down. He needed to signal for help.

Bracing against the storm, Alexander gathered dry branches. Military training kicked in as he built two fires - one at the cave entrance as a distress signal, another inside for warmth.

The flickering flames cast an orange glow across Isabella's delicate features, making her porcelain skin glow. Alexander's gaze darkened as he watched her.

"Alexander..." Her sleep-slurred murmur sent his pulse racing.

"I'm here." He knelt before her, voice rough. "Are you warmer now?"

"You're such an asshole!" Even in sleep, her hand lashed out, delivering a weak slap.

It didn't hurt - what strength did a sick kitten have?

Alexander almost smiled. Even unconscious, she couldn't resist cursing him. The damage he'd done would take a lifetime to repair.

A lifetime.

The thought sent his heart pounding. Could he spend that lifetime making amends? Protecting her? Was this... love?

Before he could stop himself, he bent down, gathering her limp form against him. His lips found hers in a searing kiss.

A soft whimper escaped her, making his blood run hotter.

Their mouths moved together desperately, his grip tightening as the kiss deepened. Eyes closed, he surrendered to instinct, wanting this moment to last forever.

Then - the roar of helicopter blades cut through the storm.

"Isabella! Don't be scared, we're saved!" Relief made him crush her tighter against his chest.

The chopper landed expertly despite the gale.

Squinting against the searchlight, Alexander's stomach dropped - this wasn't an Abernathy Group helicopter.

Who had found them?

It didn't matter. All that mattered was getting Isabella medical attention.

Scooping up his bundled wife, he strode toward the aircraft.

"Isabella!"

"Isabella!"

Two voices shouted over the rotor wash. Sebastian and Daniel emerged from the helicopter.

Alexander remained stone-faced seeing Sebastian. But the sight of the uniformed colonel beside him - tall boots, crisp green uniform - made his breath catch.

It was like looking in a mirror at his past self.

Even as CEO of a billion-dollar empire, he still missed his military days.

But right now, he cared more about this man's connection to Isabella.

"Alexander, give her back!" Daniel's handsome face twisted with anger. Rain streamed from his military cap, but nothing could bend his soldier's posture.

Unlike Daniel who'd never met Alexander, Sebastian maintained composure, though displeasure flickered across his features.

Seeing Alexander shirtless in freezing temperatures, having wrapped all his clothes around Isabella, Sebastian felt an unexpected pang of... something.

"What's wrong with Isabella?" Daniel charged forward.

Alexander stepped back protectively. "Who are you to her?"

"He's my brother and Isabella's third elder brother," Sebastian explained quickly.

Alexander's brows shot up.

Looking closer, while Daniel didn't resemble Sebastian, he shared seven out of ten features with Oliver. How had he missed it?

He'd never known Isabella had another military brother - and one with such high rank!

His lips pressed into a thin line as jealousy spiked. He pulled Isabella tighter against him.

Damn it. Why were all the men in her life so exceptional?

For the first time, Alexander Kingsley felt violently jealous over a woman - and envious of another man.

"Isabella."
###Chapter 262

Bet's chest tightened painfully, his vision blurred with unshed tears as he reached to take Evadne from Thaddeus' arms.

Among the four sons born to Evadne’s mother, Cassius appeared the most composed—but appearances deceived.

Bet, burdened by his unique position, wore a mask of icy detachment. Yet beneath that hardened exterior, he was the most tender-hearted of Emeric’s children.

Even this year, when military duty kept him from celebrating Evadne’s birthday, he had wept silently beneath his sheets in the dead of night.

His soul was soft, his emotions raw.

"Let me hold her." Thaddeus’ voice was steel, his grip unyielding as he glared down at Evadne’s feverish form.

"You don’t have the right!"

Bet’s voice cracked, tears spilling as he remembered his sister’s shattered heart. "Do you think saving her erases what you did? You abandoned her! You broke her! I’ll never thank you for this!"

"I don’t want your gratitude."

Thaddeus exhaled roughly, his voice gravelly with regret. "Evadne means everything to me. I hurt her—I know that. Everything I do now is to atone."

"You can’t!"

Bet’s interruption was sharp as a blade. "You should’ve thought of that before! Look at her—she’s a shadow of who she was because of you. Your life isn’t enough to repay that debt!"

Thaddeus stiffened, the words striking like a physical blow.

A weak murmur broke the tension.

"Home… I want to go home."

Evadne stirred in Thaddeus’ arms, her fingers curling weakly into his shirt.

"Evadne, I’m here!" Bet’s anger dissolved into desperation as he reached for her.

But as he lifted her, her grip on Thaddeus tightened.

"Don’t leave…" Her whisper was fragile, barely audible.

"I won’t." Thaddeus’ voice softened, his usual coldness melting. "You’re burning up. I’m not going anywhere."

Then, to Bet’s shock, Thaddeus looked at him—pleading. "Let me take her to the hospital. I’ll leave as soon as she’s safe."

"Absolutely not!"

"Bet."

Cassius stepped forward, his tone firm. "Let him come. We’ll all go together."

Bet’s jaw clenched.

"Mr. Thaddeus," Cassius continued calmly, "regardless of the past, you saved her tonight. That deserves acknowledgment."

A lump formed in Thaddeus’ throat. "Thank you."

He cradled Evadne closer, as if she were something precious he’d lost and reclaimed.

The Abernathy Group’s helicopter arrived moments later. Thaddeus dismissed his own team without hesitation, boarding with the brothers.

As the aircraft ascended, Thaddeus never loosened his hold.

Bet pressed a hand to Evadne’s scorching forehead, his breath hitching.

"Open your eyes, Evadne. It’s me—your brother’s home."

"Bet, it’s just a fever. She’ll be fine." Cassius tried to reassure him, though his own pulse raced.

Thaddeus’ gaze darkened. "She nearly died today. She almost went over a cliff."

Both brothers paled.

"I helped, but she saved herself."

Bet’s lips curled. "You deserve hell, Thaddeus."

Every word dripped venom. "Every ounce of pain she’s endured—it’s because of you."

"I know."

No excuses. No defenses. Thaddeus accepted the blame like a man facing execution.

"Then why?" Bet’s voice broke. "Why marry her if you didn’t love her? Why give her hope just to destroy it?"

His tear-filled eyes burned with accusation. "She built her world around you. What did you ever give her but misery?"
###Chapter 263

Sebastian Sinclair felt his entire existence had been violently upended. His heart convulsed with such excruciating pain it threatened to shatter him completely.

What had he done to her?

So many unforgivable things.

Like never proposing, something other wives received without question.

Like leaving her alone in their wedding suite on their honeymoon night, sleeping in another room.

Like never celebrating holidays together, never gifting her so much as a single rose.

Like when her grandfather was in that car accident—he hadn’t even rushed to her side.

But none of these wounds cut as deep as one particular betrayal.

During Arabella Sinclair’s most radiant years, when her love for him burned brightest, his heart had belonged to someone else.

Sebastian’s striking eyes were bloodshot, raw with anguish. He clutched Arabella’s delicate hand, pressing it desperately against his heaving chest.

Regret consumed him.

And those who wallowed in regret were always the ones who lost everything.

"Sebastian, my sister has sacrificed too much for you." Oliver Sinclair, like William, knew every torment Arabella had endured these past thirteen years. Even recalling fragments was enough to make his stomach twist. "Do you realize Arabella nearly died because of you? She was chasing after you—"

"Oliver, enough!" William cut in sharply, his brow furrowed.

Oliver swallowed the rest of his words, fists clenched in helpless fury.

He wanted to punch Sebastian, this wretched man who’d destroyed his sister! The urge was maddening.

But unlike their reckless youngest brother, Oliver had outgrown impulsive violence. Years had tempered him with rationality—only Arabella could unravel his composure and ignite his rage.

"What did you mean by that?"

A fresh wave of agony lanced through Sebastian’s chest as he realized Arabella had kept even more secrets from him. Layers of guilt and dread pressed down on him. "You said Arabella almost died because of me? When? Tell me!"

"Mr. Sinclair."

William’s voice was ice. "Whatever happened between you and my sister is over. She doesn’t wish to revisit it, and neither will we. Let this end here. But if you persist in pursuing her, if you continue to disrupt her peace, don’t blame me for what comes next."

Oliver added venomously, "Sebastian, if you care for Arabella at all, leave her be! You’ve hurt her enough. Do you want her wasting her life pining for you? Let her move on. A man who discarded her like trash doesn’t deserve a second chance."

Arabella was swiftly transported to the hospital by William and Oliver.

William kept the incident quiet, arranging a private helicopter from Kingsley City. Reginald Sinclair remained unaware—if the chairman discovered his beloved daughter had nearly died in that mountain ravine, all of Elmsworth would tremble under his wrath.

Like a shadow, Sebastian didn’t leave after disembarking. He trailed William and Oliver relentlessly.

He watched as Arabella was rushed into the ER, then transferred to a private ward.

Only then did his suspended heart begin to settle.

"Sebastian, you said you’d leave once we reached the hospital. Why are you still here?" Oliver stood blocking the ward entrance, impatience sharp in his tone.

"I’ll leave when she wakes," Sebastian replied, his face ashen.

Even if it made him seem pathetic, he didn’t care.

Lawrence had been right. There was no hope left for him and Arabella.

This was his only chance—even if it meant groveling.

"Sebastian, you’re shameless!" Even the usually composed Oliver was seething.

Sebastian absorbed the insult without flinching.

He’d heard worse. He was numb to it.

"Mr. Sinclair, Arabella hasn’t seen our youngest brother in years," William interjected coolly. "She’d rather reunite with family than endure your presence. You’re hindering her recovery. Now that she’s with us, your concern is unnecessary. Leave."

William’s tone was measured, his gaze steady. Not a single ripple of emotion.

Yet each word was a blade twisting in Sebastian’s chest, draining the life from him.

Outside, the rain had ceased. The sky lightened to a melancholic blue, like faded velvet.

Sebastian trudged out slowly, clutching his damp coat.

It still carried Arabella’s warmth. Though freezing, he hugged it tighter.

"Sebastian, my sister has sacrificed too much for you."

"Do you realize Arabella nearly died because of you? She was chasing after you—"

Chasing me? How?

Sacrificed—what else had she given up?

Oliver’s accusations looped in Sebastian’s mind. His temples throbbed violently, pain radiating through his body.

"Seb!"

"Mr. Sinclair!"

Sebastian lifted his head, sweat beading on his sculpted face.

Through blurred vision, he saw Nathaniel and Lawrence sprinting toward him.

"Seb, you look terrible. Are you okay?"

"Fine," Sebastian muttered, staring blankly at the coat in his hands.

"And Mrs. Sinclair? Did you find her? Is she alright?" Lawrence asked urgently.

Before Sebastian could respond, a tall figure shouldered past him, storming toward the hospital entrance.

"Hey! Watch it, Preston!" Lawrence barked at the retreating back.

The jolt left Sebastian dizzy. His once-sturdy frame trembled uncontrollably, legs buckling.

Preston glanced back, lips curling in a cold, mocking smirk.

"Damn it! Sebastian saved Arabella, for God’s sake! What’s with the attitude?" Lawrence fumed, itching for a fight.

"He owed her. This barely makes up for it. Expect gratitude? Keep dreaming," Preston spat before striding off.

Sebastian’s breath hitched. Sweat trickled down his forehead. His nails dug into his palms, but the physical pain was nothing compared to the torment spreading through his chest.

"Seb, something’s wrong! Let’s get you inside. Seb—!" Nathaniel’s voice faded as Sebastian gagged, blood spewing from his lips.

"Mr. Sinclair!" Lawrence’s cry was frantic.

Preston froze, stunned.

The next second, Sebastian’s body convulsed violently—then he collapsed like a marionette with severed strings.
###Chapter 264

Thaddeus collapsed without warning, crimson pooling beneath him as his body hit the floor. The sight sent shockwaves through the three men standing nearby.

Luckily, they were just outside the hospital entrance. Jareth and Gordon sprang into action, helping medical staff wheel him straight into the ER.

Jason remained frozen at the hallway's end, watching in stunned silence as they rushed past. Thaddeus's lips were smeared with blood, his complexion ghostly pale. What the hell had just happened?

Was this another one of his theatrical stunts?

But he'd returned from Misty Mountain with Miss Evadne completely unharmed. How could this indestructible-looking man suddenly drop like this?

"Mr. Jareth... will Thaddeus make it?" Gordon's voice cracked, knuckles white from clenching.

"No."

Jareth's bloodshot eyes locked onto the glowing ER sign. "Thaddeus is the toughest bastard I've ever met. He won't let something this small take him down."

Just then, one of Cassius's bodyguards approached Jason with a bow.

"Mr. Jason, President Ashbourne requests your presence upstairs."

"Understood."

Jason turned to leave but paused abruptly. "The man in emergency—Thaddeus Abernathy. Inform President Ashbourne to dispatch two top specialists immediately."

Evadne awoke the next afternoon, eyelids fluttering open like someone emerging from a decade-long slumber. "Where...?"

Every muscle screamed in protest as she tried moving. She felt hollowed out, like her very essence had been drained.

"Evadne! You're awake! It's me, Bet!"

Bet's choked cry filled the room as he lunged forward, crushing her in a desperate embrace. He'd kept vigil all night, clutching her hand until his knuckles turned white, eyes swollen from unshed tears.

"Bet... really you?" Her voice cracked, eyes welling up as her nose flushed pink.

He nodded fiercely, pressing a kiss to her fever-free forehead.

The doctor had warned them—any later arrival could've meant pneumonia. Or worse.

"The army... your leave?" Evadne fretted over him despite her own condition.

"Nothing matters more than you." His voice roughened with emotion. "Never has."

"Bet..." She buried her face against his neck, breathing in his familiar scent.

Seeing how much weight she'd lost, how the light had dimmed in her eyes—it shattered something in Bet's chest.

"Wait, how did I get here?" She pulled back slightly as he helped prop her up.

Bet's jaw tightened.

"Where's Thaddeus?" Her voice came out raspy.

"Alive. Came back with us." His tone turned glacial. "Don't waste thoughts on him."

Yet unease coiled in her gut. "Where is he?"

The door swung open abruptly.

Cassius and Jason entered, relief washing over their faces at her awake state.

"Miss Evadne!"

Jason nearly tripped in his haste, tears springing to his eyes. Noticing Bet's glare, he composed himself with a respectful bow before approaching.

"You must've been terrified last night, Jason." Her faint smile didn't reach her tired eyes. "I'm sorry for worrying everyone. It was life or death."

Jason shook his head violently, swallowing back sobs.

He'd heard the details—how she'd nearly plunged off a cliff. How Thaddeus had snatched her back from certain death.

"There's... something you should know." Jason hesitated before plunging ahead. "Thaddeus suffered internal injuries. He coughed up blood."

"What?!"

Evadne jerked upright, pulse skyrocketing. Cassius and Bet exchanged stunned glances.

"The impact damaged his organs," Jason explained bluntly. However much he disliked Thaddeus, he wouldn't lie about this.

Memory flashed—Thaddeus's back slamming against that boulder as he shielded her from falling debris. His casual dismissal afterward.

That liar!

Tears of fury blurred her vision as she swung her legs off the mattress.

Three pairs of hands shot out to restrain her.

"Evadne, no!" Bet gripped her shoulders. "You're not seriously going to him?"

"He got hurt saving me!" She fought against his hold.

"Who cares if he lives or dies?!" Bet's fingers dug in painfully. "Thirteen years of this obsession—when will it end? Please, just think of yourself for once!"

"Bet." She met his glare unflinchingly. "I can be cruel, but I won't be heartless. That man carried me off that mountain."

No argument could sway her.

Minutes later, supported by Jason, she pushed open Thaddeus's hospital room door.

Empty. Bed neatly made.

Yet his lingering scent wrapped around her like phantom arms.

"Where's the patient who was here?" She snagged a passing nurse.

"Discharged this afternoon."
###Chapter 265

At Alexander's insistence, Daniel and Sebastian transferred him to another hospital.

The private room was silent except for the steady beep of monitors. Alexander lay on the pristine white bed, an IV drip feeding into his veins.

Overnight, he'd become gaunt, shadows carving hollows beneath his striking cheekbones. Yet even now, weakened and pale, his beauty was infuriating—enough to make Daniel grind his teeth.

"You're a menace," Daniel drawled, slouching in the visitor's chair with arms crossed behind his head. "Even half-dead, you'd probably seduce Death herself. Some men are just born sinners."

Alexander cracked one eye open, his dark gaze simmering with irritation. "If I wanted a eulogy, I'd have hired a poet."

"You're welcome. I'm the only friend brave enough to mock you while you're bedridden."

A dry chuckle escaped Alexander's lips before dissolving into a wince. He pressed a hand to his ribs. "Remind me why I tolerate you?"

"Because no one else puts up with your brooding." Daniel leaned forward, elbows on knees. "Seriously though, you scared the hell out of me. I've already called in the top specialists. If they can't fix you, I'll drag every doctor from here to Zurich. Money moves mountains—I'll buy you a new set of lungs if I have to."

Alexander exhaled sharply. "Dramatic."

"Damn right. And if you end up paralyzed? Congrats, you'll be my new arm candy. Wife or not, you're stuck with me."

Alexander's eyebrow twitched. "I'd rather haunt you as a ghost."

Daniel grinned, but the levity didn't reach his eyes. Beneath the banter, fear lingered. "Just don't die, Kingsley. Your family's pack of vultures would pick your empire clean—and take me down with them."

A shadow crossed Alexander's face.

He remembered the moment blood filled his mouth, the world narrowing to two faces: his grandfather... and Isabella.

His chest tightened.

Was she awake? Had her fever broken? Did her injuries from the cliff ache as much as his?

Every thought led back to her.

Alexander clenched the sheets, fighting the urge to bolt from this bed and find her.

Had he truly fallen for her?

The realization hit like a bullet.

His pulse stuttered.

"Whoa." Daniel frowned. "You're flushed. Running a fever?"

He reached out, only for Alexander to smack his hand away.

"Ow! Still got fight in you, huh?" Daniel rubbed his knuckles, grinning.

A sharp knock interrupted them.

Before either could respond, the door flew open.

Sebastian rushed in, breathless. "Sir—"

A cold, crystalline voice cut through the room.

"Alexander Kingsley. You nearly die saving me, then vanish without a word?"

Isabella strode in, a vision in ice-blue silk and a tailored white coat. Her cheeks were flushed with health, her gaze sharp as shattered glass. No trace remained of the woman who'd trembled in his arms last night.

Alexander's throat went dry.

She stopped at the foot of his bed, arms crossed. "Well? Cat got your tongue?"

Sebastian cleared his throat. "Ms. Sinclair, we transferred Mr. Kingsley to avoid worrying you during your recovery."

"Worry?" Isabella scoffed. "About him?"

Sebastian dared a smile. "Yet here you are."

Her glare could've frozen lava.

Alexander hid a smirk.

"Out," she ordered.

Sebastian hesitated.

"All of you."

Like scolded schoolboys, the men filed out.

The door clicked shut.

Isabella marched to Alexander's bedside. "Your medical report says blunt force trauma. Delayed treatment could've killed you."

"But it didn't." His voice was rough velvet. "I've survived worse."

Her fingers twitched. Memories of Zenithia—gunfire, adrenaline, his body shielding hers—flashed between them.

"I don't need your martyrdom," she snapped. "If you're hurt, tell me. Hiding helps no one."

"Sebastian explained—"

"Your back." She cut him off. "Show me."

Alexander arched a brow.

"Now," she demanded. "Unless the great Alexander Kingsley is shy?"

A slow smile curved his lips. "You've seen me shirtless before."

"And you refused to let me touch you then." The words slipped out. Pink stained her cheeks.

The air thickened.

Alexander unbuttoned his gown with deliberate slowness, revealing sculpted muscle and old scars.

Isabella's breath hitched.

"Lie down," she ordered, voice uneven.
###Chapter 266

The usually defiant and rebellious Alexander Kingsley was uncharacteristically compliant, his movements as pliant as a fish on a griddle, flipping at the slightest touch.

Isabella Sinclair arched a brow at his sudden obedience, her rosy lips pressing into a thin line.

His broad, muscular back was exposed to her, every sinew and ridge clearly defined.

The sight of a massive bruise marring his skin made her pupils constrict. Despite her effort to remain composed, her heart twisted painfully. When Isabella fell silent, Alexander assumed she was shocked. He started to turn, only to be stopped by her firm grip.

"Stay still. Let me look," she commanded.

"The doctor said it'll fade," Alexander murmured, his voice low and soothing—as if he were comforting her, not discussing his own injuries.

"Do I look blind to you?" Isabella snapped, her tone sharp as ice.

Caught off guard, Alexander exhaled in exasperation. "I never realized how fiery you were when we were together. You've got bite. And guts."

"I used to pretend," she said, her long lashes casting shadows over her eyes as her fingers traced the scars on his back. Her voice was frigid. "I thought if I was gentle, if I pleased you, you'd eventually soften. But when I saw your true colors, I stopped. I didn’t need to pretend anymore. Looking back, I was a fool. Humiliating myself for a man who’d never love me. It wasn’t worth it."

Alexander’s breath hitched, bitterness coating his tongue. He’d been blind, consumed by his own insecurities.

"Isabella—"

"Turn around," she cut him off.

"The doctor already checked me."

"I don’t trust anyone else. Only myself. Turn around." Her voice was detached, her gaze reflecting a stoic acceptance of life and death.

Confused but obedient, Alexander complied.

Their eyes locked as he faced her.

Isabella’s pulse stuttered at the sight of his chiseled torso. The man was infuriating, but his physique was undeniably breathtaking.

Steeling herself, she began examining his legs, arms, and abdomen.

Alexander watched her, his heartbeat erratic as he studied the determination in her gaze.

At that moment, he needed to know.

"You’re lucky you have a soldier’s build. No serious injuries, but that bruise needs attention. My friend Seraphina’s family just developed a new topical treatment. I’ll get some sent over," Isabella said, her fingers lightly grazing his ribs.

Suddenly, his hand closed over hers, pressing her palm flat against his chest.

Isabella startled, her pulse skyrocketing. "What are you doing?"

His gaze burned into hers, his breathing uneven. "Don’t you need to check here too?"

"No. Let go!" She tried to pull away.

But Alexander was stronger, yanking her against him. Their bodies collided, heat radiating between them.

His uninjured arm banded around her waist, pulling her flush against him.

"Alexander—"

His lips crashed onto hers, swallowing her protest. The kiss was relentless, stealing her breath. A soft whimper escaped her, her nails digging into his skin, leaving faint marks.

Flustered, Isabella bit his lip in retaliation.

Alexander didn’t flinch. Instead, he hauled her closer.

The metallic tang of blood filled their mouths.

He didn’t release her until she was gasping for air.

Both were breathless, sweat glistening on their brows. Alexander’s lower lip was swollen from her bite.

"Just because you saved me doesn’t mean you can do whatever you want!" Isabella snapped, her cheeks flushed, her chest heaving.

"You said it yourself," Alexander murmured, touching his injured lip. "You owe me a favor. And as long as it wasn’t too much, you’d comply."

"Isn’t this too much?" Her voice cracked. "When will you let me go? We’re divorced. You were the one who ended it!"

"Then I regret it." His voice was raw, his eyes damp. "I regret all of it."

Unlike Isabella, who could laugh freely, cry openly, live unapologetically—Alexander had spent over twenty years suppressing every emotion, every impulse. He’d forgotten how to feel.

"What did you say?" She stared at him, stunned.

"Isabella, I regret it," he repeated, his voice firm yet soft. "I regret divorcing you. I regret letting you go. Give me another chance. Let’s start over."

Start over? From where, Alexander? she thought bitterly. You don’t even know about the child we lost. You don’t know the pain of the last thirteen years. And yet you dare ask for a fresh start?

The light in her eyes dimmed, like a jewel smothered in dust.

Seeing her cold expression, Alexander’s heart clenched, his fervor cooling.

"Alexander, we’re over. Do you understand what that means? There’s no future for us."

Her eyes glistened, but her voice was merciless. "Between us, there was never even a spark, let alone a flame. From our marriage to our divorce, it was nothing but mistakes and misery. My father once told me—real love is smooth sailing from start to finish. The only reason we lasted three years was because I kept lowering my standards for you. What’s there to reminisce about? Start over? Have I lost my mind?"

Each word was a knife, carving into his chest.

Alexander wasn’t ready to lose her. He reached for her again.

This time, she evaded him effortlessly, leaving his hand grasping at air.

"I swear, I won’t—"

He took a shuddering breath, his voice hoarse. "I won’t repeat my mistakes, Isabella. This time, you don’t have to do a thing. Just stand there. Let me pursue you."

Her heart lurched violently, like a rollercoaster gone rogue.

Her palms were damp, her breathing uneven, her pulse erratic.

"Pursue me? Mr. Kingsley, didn’t you once call me a shameless schemer? I’m not some delicate flower like Camille. How could you possibly want me?"

Her lips curled in disdain. "Besides, the Isabella you see now isn’t the naive girl you manipulated. Plenty of men are lining up to court me. Do you really think a blacklisted bastard like you stands a chance?"

"Isabella, I—"

"Stop. I don’t want to hear it."

She clapped her hands over her ears, spinning on her heel and striding toward the door. "I’ll chalk up everything you said today to concussion-induced delirium. I’m treating your injuries because I don’t owe you anything. Once you’re healed, we go our separate ways!"

The door slammed shut behind her.

Alexander’s eyes burned crimson, his outstretched hand trembling mid-air before dropping limply to his side.

"I’ve truly fallen for you," he whispered.

Isabella didn’t return to Alexander. Instead, she sought out Gordon for his medical reports, intending to study them thoroughly at home.

Her preliminary examination had revealed the severity of his injuries. If not treated properly, they could lead to serious complications.

The Rolls-Royce glided toward Skyrim.

Jason drove while Preston sat shotgun. In the back, Sebastian held Isabella close, her arms full of Alexander’s medical records and X-rays. She rested her head on his shoulder, sighing heavily.

Her mood was visibly somber.

"What’s wrong, Isabella? You seem upset," Sebastian murmured, gently brushing her cheek.

"Is it because Kingsley’s condition is bad?"

Preston twisted in his seat. "If that bastard’s hurt, it’s good news. Why the long face?"

Isabella remained silent.

"Preston, have you forgotten what kind of person our sister is?" Sebastian chided. "Gracious and kind-hearted. Alexander got hurt saving her. If anything happens to him, how could she live with herself?"

Preston scowled but held his tongue.

"His injuries are serious, but he was treated in time. He’s not in danger," Isabella finally said softly.

"Well, that’s good," Sebastian replied, puzzled. "Then why are you still upset?"

Isabella hesitated. "It’s nothing major. It’s just... Alexander said he wants to pursue me."
###Chapter 267

The tension in the car was suffocating.

Three pairs of wide eyes stared in shock—even Adrian, who was driving, nearly lost control of the wheel.

"Serena, what did you just say?" Dominic, usually composed, looked equally stunned.

"Damien says he regrets divorcing me. He wants another chance. This time, he plans to court me properly."

Serena lifted her delicate chin, her almond-shaped eyes locking onto Dominic. "Dominic, what does this mean? Is he confessing his feelings?"

Blake and Adrian blurted out simultaneously, "No question about it!"

Then, as if sharing one mind, they added in unison, "The audacity!"

Dominic blinked, his brows furrowing slightly.

"Dominic, can you believe it? The man who shattered our future now wants to win me back with empty promises." Serena forced a bitter smile. Once, this would have made her weep with joy.

Now, all she felt was confusion.

It was like a childhood toy she'd desperately wanted but never received. Years later, even if she got a better version, the magic was gone. Why would Damien even want her now?

She'd given him everything, and he'd thrown it all away.

Now that she stood against him, humiliating him at every turn—why would he?

"Love that comes too late is worse than weeds. Damien's so-called confession is nothing but garbage!" Blake gritted his teeth, his hatred palpable.

"Exactly. What was he thinking before?" Adrian tightened his grip on the steering wheel, his voice low.

"Serena, you gave him your all when you married him. Have you forgotten the pain once the wounds healed? Now that you're the heiress of the Sinclair fortune, adored by everyone, at the peak of your beauty and success—he's jealous. He regrets. He thinks he was blind before, so now he wants you back to feed his disgusting ego!" Blake's handsome face twisted with fury as he spat out the words.

"I wouldn't call it ego." Serena rolled her eyes. "But you're right, Blake. He probably finds me more intriguing now. After all, it wasn’t until I reclaimed my Sinclair name that he even looked at me twice."

"Ugh, men are all the same—chasing novelty and thrill." Adrian couldn't hold back his anger. "He got tired of sweet, innocent Cassandra, and now he's into your fire. He just changed his taste. Yesterday it was dirt, today it's durian. Today he says he wants you—tomorrow, who knows?"

Blake nodded sharply. "Once a cheater, always a cheater!"

Serena arched a brow. "I get that dirt refers to Cassandra. But durian? Explain that one."

Adrian coughed awkwardly. "Miss Serena, it was just a metaphor."

"Nothing wrong with durian. It's the king of fruits—fits your personality perfectly," Dominic chimed in casually.

"But durians are spiky and stink!"

"The inside is soft, sweet, and fragrant." Dominic grinned, brushing his fingertip against her nose. "Kinda like you."

"Humph!" Serena turned away, pretending to be annoyed—though the effect was more adorable than anything.

"Serena, no matter what, don’t fall for Damien again! Men like him don’t change!" Blake pleaded, terrified she might relapse.

"I’m an exception, Mr. Blake," Adrian weakly defended himself.

"Count me in," Dominic added quickly.

"Right, right, the Sinclair men are different," Blake hurriedly corrected himself.

"Well, not all of them. There’s always one dragging us down," Serena teased, crossing her slender legs.

The three men exchanged glances, the same name flashing in their minds simultaneously:

William!

"Absolutely not!"

Vivienne, upon hearing Serena’s request to help Damien, flushed with anger.

This stepmother, who usually indulged Serena, flat-out refused to treat him.

"Vivienne, just hear me out," Serena said helplessly.

"There’s nothing to discuss." Vivienne waved her hand dismissively, her voice icy. "I remember everything Damien did to you—so do Arabella and Sophia. Isn’t he the CEO of Abernathy Group? Let them figure it out!"

"Vivienne—"

"Oh, right. He’s surrounded by women. Why aren’t they mourning their beloved?" Vivienne’s words were venomous, as if she wanted to tear Damien apart with her teeth.

"Vivienne, Damien is despicable, but this time, he saved me." Serena pulled Vivienne onto the couch, sounding more like the adult in the room.

Vivienne frowned. "What do you mean?"

Serena explained in detail how she’d gone to rescue someone on Misty Mountain, how she’d gotten into danger, how Damien had saved her—and how he’d been injured in the process.

By the time she finished, Vivienne’s hand, clutched in Serena’s, had turned cold with fear.

"Serena, you reckless girl! If I were your mother, I’d lock you up and give you a good spanking! How could you be so reckless?!"

"Only Dominic, Blake, and Adrian know. William is completely in the dark." Serena pressed a finger to her lips, lowering her voice. "You have to promise to keep this a secret. If William finds out, his blood pressure will skyrocket."

"I don’t feel like covering for you anymore. Over the past three years of your messy history with Damien, we’ve had to clean up so much—we might as well have a classified dossier on you!" Vivienne tapped Serena’s forehead lightly. "I should tell your father and let him deal with you!"

"It won’t help. William can’t control me even if he tries." Serena grinned, looking utterly pleased with herself.

After more heartfelt persuasion, Vivienne finally relented.

"Serena, tell me the truth. Do you still have feelings for him?" Vivienne’s voice softened with concern.

"No." Serena’s answer was firm. "I’m not a pig, and I won’t jump back into the pigpen. I just don’t like owing anyone."

There was a brief flicker of unease, but it passed quickly.

"Good. If you ever think of getting back with him, you won’t have a home to return to." Vivienne gave her a chilling look. "What will you choose—your family or that jerk?"

Serena rubbed her goosebump-covered arms nervously.

"Serena! Vivienne!" Sophia knocked and entered. "The dresses for Arabella’s birthday party are here. Come help pick one out! I don’t understand women’s fashion—I wore jeans to my own wedding."

"Coming!" Serena, eager to escape Vivienne’s interrogation, quickly dragged her along.

The three women hurried to Arabella’s room.

Rows of dazzling evening gowns, all limited edition and haute couture, lined the racks—a feast for the eyes!

Custom-made heels, studded with diamonds, were arranged on the floor. The extravagance was staggering.

Any other woman would have squealed in delight. The diamonds alone could buy a mansion.

But Arabella, dressed in a simple lavender sweater, sat on the couch, looking troubled.

"Arabella, what’s wrong? Your birthday’s coming up. Why so gloomy?" Serena sat beside her, wrapping an arm around her.

"Serena, please talk to your father for me. Cancel the party." Arabella sighed. "I’ve been begging him for weeks. A quiet family dinner at home would be enough. I don’t like crowds, and entertaining guests is exhausting. But William won’t listen. What do I do?"

"Wow, Arabella, you’re really showing off!" Sophia teased.

"You sound a little bratty!" Vivienne joined in, arm around Sophia’s waist.

Serena’s heart ached.

Growing up, Arabella had always kept a low profile to spare Serena’s feelings. The only time she was visible was in the kitchen, preparing meals.

Back then, Serena, too young to understand, had seen Arabella as her mother’s rival. To protect her mother’s memory, she’d caused chaos, even accusing Arabella of terrible things.

She’d thought these women had no self-respect, clinging to William despite his marriage.

It wasn’t until later, when Dominic told her the truth, that she understood.

Years ago, when her mother was dying of lupus, Arabella had donated bone marrow without hesitation.

Medical technology then wasn’t what it was now. The procedure was risky, and Arabella had suffered chronic pain ever since.

Though her mother had still passed away, Arabella had given her an extra year—a year more with Serena.

Later, when Serena lost her baby with Damien, it was Arabella who stayed by her side, caring for her like a mother.

Slowly, Serena’s resentment faded.

How could she hate someone who’d been nothing but kind for twenty years? Even her mother hadn’t—why should she?

"Arabella, let’s do what William wants." Serena held Arabella’s arm like a daughter, smiling gently. "It’s not just his idea—it’s mine too. In twenty years, you’ve never had a proper birthday. I’ve always felt guilty about that."

"Silly girl, what are you talking about?" Arabella looked shocked. "I chose not to celebrate. It had nothing to do with you!"

"Then, will you grant me this wish? Let us throw you a party, okay?"

"Arabella! Look at Serena! Just go with it!" Vivienne and Sophia coaxed.

Finally, Arabella gave in and began selecting a dress.

"None of these are good enough." Serena crossed her arms, critically eyeing the expensive gowns. "So tacky. William has terrible taste. Clearly, he didn’t inherit my style."

"They’re fine, Serena," Arabella said quickly.

"No, they’re not." Serena shook her head, her eyes gleaming. "If you’re wearing a dress, it should be one-of-a-kind, designed by the best. Arabella, have you heard of Elara?"

"Elara?" Vivienne and Arabella gasped.

Only Sophia, the tomboy, looked puzzled—though the name sounded familiar.

"I’ve invited her to design your birthday dress. What do you think?" Serena’s smile was radiant.

"Serena, are you serious? Elara? The Elara?" Vivienne stared in disbelief.

"Is there another Elara in the world?" Serena retorted.

"William once tried to commission Elara for Arabella, but he couldn’t even get a meeting. Serena, how do you have that kind of connection?"

A secretive smile tugged at Serena’s lips.

William would never guess that Elara had been right under his nose all along—the little girl he’d raised!

"Of course. Elara and I go way back. She owes me a favor." Serena pulled Arabella into a hug. "Arabella, on that day, you’ll wear jewelry by Elara, a gown by Elara, and you’ll outshine everyone. Let them see the grace of the former queen once more."

"Serena..." Arabella’s eyes welled up.

"Don’t worry. That day, you’ll be the woman every other woman envies."
###Chapter 268

The newly developed medications for internal and external injuries, both produced by the Sinclair Group, were finally handed over to Isabella by Seraphina.

The following morning, Isabella sent Daniel to deliver the medicine to Nathaniel.

Nathaniel, who had been reluctant to show any weakness in front of Daniel—his rival who currently held the upper hand—felt his spirits plummet when he saw Daniel arrive alone, without Isabella.

"Where's Isabella?"

Nathaniel leaned against the headboard, his striking figure exuding an air of melancholy, his gaze tinged with self-pity.

Unfortunately for him, Isabella wasn’t there to witness his dramatic display.

"Miss Isabella is occupied. She instructed me to bring you the medicine."

Daniel placed the rare and expensive drugs on the bedside table, his expression cold as he studied Nathaniel’s pale face. "Miss Isabella said one should be applied three times daily, and the other taken once a day. She’ll send me with more in two weeks. These medications function like targeted therapies. There may be side effects—nausea, dizziness. If you experience severe reactions, inform Miss Isabella immediately. Understood?"

Nathaniel remained silent, his brows knitting together.

"Are you sure these won’t cause complications? They seem extremely potent," Harrison murmured under his breath, concerned for Nathaniel’s discomfort.

"Your life, your choice. If you think Miss Isabella is trying to poison you, don’t take them. It’s up to you."

With that, Daniel turned to leave.

"I won’t take them," Nathaniel finally spoke, his voice weak but firm.

Daniel spun around, startled. "Excuse me?"

Isabella had specifically ordered him to ensure Nathaniel took the medicine. Now, Nathaniel was refusing.

How was he supposed to report back to her?

"I’ll only take them if Isabella comes to see me herself. Otherwise, I won’t accept her charity."

Nathaniel held his ground, his eyes filled with quiet desperation. "Thirteen years ago, I saved her life. Thirteen years later, I did it again. Even if we’re divorced, even if she hates me, she can’t deny what I’ve done for her. She can’t just dismiss me like this."

"Nathaniel—"

Daniel was cut off by Nathaniel’s unwavering tone. "At the very least, this time, I want her to come and tend to me herself."

Tend to him? With affection?

Daniel clenched his fists so hard his knuckles turned white.

Nathaniel was the last man in the world who deserved Isabella’s care.

"Exactly!"

Harrison, who usually lacked tact, suddenly grasped his boss’s intentions and chimed in. "Mr. Nathaniel has suffered endlessly to save Miss Isabella! Constant pain, loss of appetite, sleepless nights—he even coughed up blood this morning! I’m terrified he might not wake up one day! Is this how Miss Isabella repays the man who saved her life? That’s heartless!"

Nathaniel shot Harrison a look—he was overdoing it.

Daniel gritted his teeth and stormed out without another word.

The moment the door closed, Nathaniel, who had been so composed moments ago, suddenly doubled over, coughing violently, blood staining his lips.

"Mr. Nathaniel!"

Harrison panicked, frantically pressing the call button as he wiped the blood from Nathaniel’s lips. "You can’t keep doing this! Stop holding a grudge against Mrs. Sinclair! If she sent the medicine, just take it!"

"No." Nathaniel’s refusal was stubborn, his eyes shadowed with sorrow. "This is my only chance to have her by my side, even if just for a little while. Even if it kills me, I want to see Isabella. I’ll fight for this chance."

"What? That bastard refuses to take the medicine? Why?"

Isabella was having dinner with her family when Daniel pulled her aside to deliver the news. She was so furious she lost her appetite.

"He said he’ll only take it if you come personally," Daniel seethed. "He’s manipulating you! You’ve done more than enough for him. Let him suffer on his own. Don’t waste another second on him!"

"Get the car ready. We’re leaving for Elmsworth now."

Isabella’s eyes burned with anger as she issued the command and stormed off to change.

"Miss Isabella!"

Daniel watched her hurry away, his heart aching.

He had kept Nathaniel’s hospitalization a secret from the Sinclair family.

Given his position, even his health was confidential. Too many people inside and outside Sinclair Group coveted his role. If word got out, it could be used against him.

All these years, he had walked a tightrope.

All because he wasn’t Reginald’s favored son.

That night, the only visitor Nathaniel received was still Adrian.

Nathaniel hadn’t mentioned his coughing blood today, not wanting to worry Adrian or distract him from finding a solution.

"Man, you look terrible," Adrian remarked, sprawled lazily on the couch, clearly enjoying Nathaniel’s misery. Seeing him pale and exhausted, like a wilting flower, he couldn’t resist teasing, "Just a few months ago, you were the king of the world, Nathaniel."

Nathaniel barely lifted an eyelid. "What’s your point?"

"Back then, you had a devoted wife at home and a passionate lover waiting in the wings. Life was perfect, wasn’t it?"

"Adrian." Nathaniel’s face darkened, as if he might cough up blood again from sheer frustration.

"You used to complain every time we met, saying how suffocated you felt by that overly attentive woman. I envied you, you know? A thousand servants can’t compare to a woman who genuinely cares."

Adrian sighed, a hint of bitterness in his tone. He pitied Isabella and regretted his friend’s loss.

"I didn’t hate Isabella back then," Nathaniel admitted, the memory of her kindness like a dull knife twisting in his heart. "I knew how much she loved me. I pushed her away because I wanted her to face reality and leave me sooner. I couldn’t give her a future then. Staying with me would’ve wasted her time and life."

"And now? Are you trying to win her back with some half-baked friendly approach?" Adrian tilted his head, lazily pulling out a cigarette and placing it between his lips.

Remembering they were in a hospital, he didn’t light it, just satisfying the habit.

After a long silence, Nathaniel took a deep breath and whispered, "Adrian, I think I’ve fallen for her."

Damn.

Adrian nearly choked on his cigarette.

"I’ve fallen for Isabella. So, I want her back. I want to try to win her over." Nathaniel looked up, his voice trembling slightly with raw honesty.

His usually captivating eyes were now earnest, filled with determination.

"You? Chasing a woman? Are you even capable?" Adrian asked skeptically.

"There’s a first time for everything. If I can’t, I’ll learn."

Nathaniel shot him a sidelong glance. "Besides, if I fail, I still have you—my supposedly reliable wingman."

"Hey! Don’t insult me. Can’t you go five minutes without mocking me?" Adrian narrowed his eyes.

"I know you’re no expert either, or you’d have won her over by now," Nathaniel continued dryly. "But desperate times call for desperate measures. I’ll have to rely on you—reluctantly."

He had never pursued a woman before. He had never needed to chase Cassandra—she had always been the one making moves. But for Isabella, he was willing to set aside his pride and fight.

"It’s not that I’m bad at wooing women," Adrian grumbled. "It’s just that Isabella has everything—beauty, wealth, status, talent. She’s untouchable. What could I possibly offer to impress her?"

Nathaniel’s lips curved into a rare smile.

"Besides, my friend, not to crush your hopes, but you’re no longer her treasure—you’re just a weed by the roadside. Winning her back will be harder than climbing to heaven. Are you prepared for endless rejection?"

"That’s fine. I’ll keep trying. Whether she accepts me or not is her choice."

Nathaniel’s resolve was unshakable, his gaze steady. "I believe I still have a long life ahead. I won’t love anyone else. One step at a time."

Just as he finished speaking, the door burst open with a bang.

Isabella strode in, the chill of early winter clinging to her, her hair swaying, her eyes blazing with fury.

"Nathaniel! You refuse to take the medicine unless I come personally? Are you playing with your life? What’s the meaning of this?"

The moment she entered, her gaze landed on Adrian, lounging with an unlit cigarette between his lips. Enraged, she snatched it away, threw it to the ground, and crushed it under her heel.

"Are you insane? He has lung injuries! No smoke, not even unlit! Are you his friend or the Grim Reaper?"

Seeing her anger, Nathaniel couldn’t help but smile.

"But Isabella, I didn’t light it!" Adrian protested.

"Get out. Now." Isabella pointed at the door.

Adrian cast a pleading look at Nathaniel, who simply said, "When she tells you to leave, you leave."

Adrian thought, Damn. Worst wingman ever.

Once Adrian was gone, only Nathaniel and Isabella remained in the hospital room.
###Chapter 269

The moment Isabella stepped inside, Gordon informed her that Nathaniel had coughed up blood again—a significant amount this time. A cold dread slithered down her spine.

If Nathaniel didn’t recover, or if this illness became chronic, she would carry the weight of guilt forever. Every waking moment would be a reminder of what she owed him.

Her expression hardened as she marched to his bedside. Without ceremony, she seized his wrist, her fingers pressing against his pulse with clinical precision.

Nathaniel’s eyes widened slightly. The intensity of her focus was almost comical—like a seasoned physician diagnosing a terminal patient.

"Your condition is critical. You need to take your medication now. Waiting until tomorrow could be disastrous." Her voice was sharp, edged with irritation. Just as she moved to release him, Nathaniel’s large hand closed around hers, trapping her cool fingers in his warmth.

Isabella gasped, her breath catching.

"Your hands are freezing. Is it cold outside?" His thumb brushed over the scars still marring her skin, and his chest tightened with regret. "I’m sorry for dragging you here so late because of me."

"You should be sorry!" She yanked her hand back, her temper flaring. "If you’re truly remorseful, then take your damn medicine. Stop acting like a child! Do I need to spoon-feed you?"

"No," Nathaniel murmured, his voice soft. "I just didn’t know how else to see you. I wanted to see you, Isabella."

"Fine. You’ve seen me. Now take your medicine." Her tone was icy, unimpressed by his sudden meekness.

Frustration coiled inside her, fueled by Olivia and Daniel’s earlier words. She checked her watch impatiently. "Hurry up. After this, I need to return to Skycrest. Olivia’s home tonight, and I won’t waste another second here with you."

Nathaniel flinched. His fingers curled into a fist.

The woman who once adored him now barely tolerated his presence.

But he had no one to blame but himself. Regret was a bitter pill, but he’d swallow it.

Winning her back seemed impossible, but he’d keep trying until his last breath.

"Isabella, you can’t deny I’m in this state because of you," he said, desperate to prolong their time. "I nearly died for you. You can’t just walk away."

"What do you want?" Her eyes flashed with anger.

"Stay. Take care of me until I’m discharged." His gaze never left her face.

Isabella laughed bitterly. "I’ve never met anyone as shameless as you!"

Disgust twisted in his gut—but he’d seen how Alexander pursued women. Relentlessness worked.

Nathaniel didn’t know passion, but he knew persistence.

"Listen," she snapped, her voice glacial. "I’m not your wife, nor am I a servant of the Kingsley family. I owe you nothing. Remember how you dismissed my care before? You found it annoying. Now you’re begging? What’s wrong with you?"

"I love you, Isabella!" The words burst from him, raw and unguarded. "I don’t care if you hate me. I love you. I’ve fallen for you."

She recoiled, stunned.

Silence swallowed the room, their heartbeats the only sound.

"If you’d said that three years ago, I would’ve believed you. But it’s too late." Her voice was hollow. "Our love expired. I don’t love you anymore."

"I know it’s too late. But I won’t give up." Sweat beaded on his forehead. He wanted to reach for her but feared she’d bolt. "You don’t love me? Fine. This time, let me love you."

"Enough!" Her voice cracked like a whip. "I don’t want your love! How many times must I say it? If you mention this again, I’m leaving!"

Nathaniel clamped his mouth shut.

After a tense pause, he ventured, "If I don’t bring it up… will you stay tonight?"

"Dream on."

"You promised me a favor for saving your life."

"Yesterday, didn’t you—" She broke off, cheeks flushing as she remembered his kiss. Heat prickled across her skin.

"You mean the kiss? That didn’t count." His lips curved, smug.

Her glare could’ve melted steel.

"I forced it, but you fought back." He pointed to his split lip. "Proof."

"Serves you right! For a scoundrel like you, I should’ve bitten it clean off!" Her face burned.

Nathaniel leaned back, grinning. "Go ahead."

She gritted her teeth. The urge to flip his bed was overwhelming.

Seeing no escape, Isabella relented. She’d stay—just tonight.

She’d left in such a rush that she hadn’t packed anything. Daniel was sent to fetch her pajamas and toiletries from Elmsworth Manor.

In the hallway, Daniel returned, expression grim.

"Thanks. Go rest. Pick me up early tomorrow." She reached for the suitcase, but he held tight, eyes red-rimmed.

"Miss Isabella, please come home."

"Nathaniel’s request isn’t unreasonable. I owe him this."

"But you’re sharing a room! What if he—"

"We were married for three years. If he wanted to force himself on me, he’d have done it by now."

Daniel hesitated.

Isabella waved him off. "Don’t worry. Even the worst men know the rules. If he tries anything, I’ll break him. Believe me."
###Chapter 270

The moment Isabella stepped into the hospital room, Sebastian received a call from Alexander.

"Mr. Dubois."

"Sebastian! As Isabella's assistant, how could you not inform us of her whereabouts immediately?"

Alexander's interrogation was sharp. "Why are you and Isabella at Elmsworth Second Hospital? Is she there to see Nathaniel?"

A calm voice followed. "Alexander, relax."

Truth be told, Alexander was usually composed, but when it came to Isabella, his patience evaporated.

Sebastian blinked in confusion. "Mr. Dubois, how did you know?"

Isabella's visit to Nathaniel was supposed to be confidential!

"Satellite tracking."

Cassius sighed. "Alexander is practically using every tactic reserved for fugitives, yet he still can't keep track of one person?"

Sebastian fell silent.

"Calm down, Alexander. You know Isabella well enough—no amount of scolding will make her obedient."

Cassius sounded resigned. "We're all adults here. Let her do as she pleases."

"I'm dispatching a security team to surround the hospital immediately. Hands-on at the ward door. Sebastian, it's going to be a long night for you. If that bastard Nathaniel dares lay a finger on Isabella, you report to me instantly."

"Yes, Mr. Dubois!" Sebastian stiffened under the colonel's intimidating tone.

Alexander's voice was ice-cold. "If Nathaniel harms my sister, he won't leave that hospital alive."

Isabella agreed to stay.

Nathaniel, elated, took his medicine and applied his ointment without complaint.

The hospital dinner was bland and unappetizing.

But with Isabella beside him, Nathaniel devoured it as if it were a gourmet feast.

Watching him eat like a starved man, Isabella decided to order something for herself as a late-night snack.

She forced down the tasteless meal, refusing to waste food.

"You should eat something more nourishing," she remarked. "Like clam chowder or beef stew."

"Can you make it for me?" Nathaniel asked hopefully.

"I've cooked for you before. You never seemed to care."

Isabella scoffed, pushing her tray aside. She grabbed her pajamas and toiletries, heading to the bathroom. "Vanessa is a decent cook. Ask her."

The door clicked shut.

Nathaniel swallowed hard, the taste of regret bitter in his mouth.

Starting over was harder than he'd imagined.

Isabella emerged from the bathroom in a peach silk nightgown.

Her skin glowed, fresh and radiant without makeup. Stripped of her usual polished look, she appeared younger—more like eighteen than twenty-four.

Nathaniel's pulse quickened. His gaze lingered.

"What are you staring at? Never seen a bare face before?" She spritzed moisturizer, the hospital air dry against her skin.

"I've seen it. Often, actually."

He forced his voice steady. "It just... brings back memories."

"Your gaze was nostalgic? I didn't notice." She settled onto the couch, pulling a blanket over herself.

Nathaniel had no retort.

Her words were sharp, cutting without vulgarity.

When she targeted him, it was surgical.

"Cross my line, and you're dead."

She lay down, slipping on a silk eye mask. "Goodnight."

"Sleep in the bed."

"Nathaniel, we're divorced. Are you seriously dreaming of sharing a bed with your ex-wife? Asking for trouble?"

"No—that's not what I meant." He laughed bitterly. "I was offering you the bed."

"One more word, and I'm leaving. You've had your medicine. Nothing's keeping me here."

He clamped his mouth shut.

He'd fought to make her stay. He couldn't ruin this.

The lights dimmed. The room fell silent.

Nathaniel couldn't sleep.

He lay on his side, stealing glances at Isabella.

Even with her back turned, she was breathtaking under the moonlight—like a sculpted masterpiece.

"Still staring? Keep it up, and I walk." Her voice cut through the dark.

"Sorry. Didn't mean to disturb you." His heart lurched.

How careful he'd become—living in fear, in humility.

"No. It's just... your breathing changes when you sleep. I can tell."

Silence settled between them.

Isabella curled tighter, clutching her nightgown.

She hated herself.

How pathetic she'd been—memorizing every detail of this man.

Nathaniel's chest tightened with guilt. The air grew thin, suffocating.

For three years, he'd slept soundly.

But her? How many nights had she spent alone?

"Isabella... I really was an asshole." His voice was rough.

"Let it go. It's over. Just don't repeat the past."

"I mean it—"

She cut him off with a soft laugh. "If you'd ever loved me, it would've happened long ago. Why now? Even if you've suddenly 'developed feelings,' it's just a whim. I'm not naive enough to mistake fleeting passion for devotion."
###Chapter 271

Lucas's chest felt like it was filled with shards of glass, his fingers curling tightly into the fabric of his shirt.

No. This isn't right.

Isabella.

I don't do things on a whim. My feelings for you aren't some fleeting infatuation. Does love that endures not count as love? Thirteen years ago, we faced death together. Thirteen years later, we did it again. We're bound by something unbreakable.

For the first time in his life, Lucas understood the agony of unspoken love. The suffocating weight of words trapped inside him, unable to escape.

But he stayed silent.

This wasn't the time to speak.

He needed to act.

Though Isabella's fever had broken, her body was still weak. Exhausted from the ordeal, she had fallen asleep the moment her head touched the pillow.

But Lucas remained wide awake, watching her like a sentinel, his gaze unwavering.

Only when he was certain she was deep in slumber did he grit his teeth against the pain and rise from the bed, moving silently to the sofa.

He had intended to simply admire her peaceful expression, but the sight of her curled uncomfortably on the narrow couch made his chest tighten. Gently, he lifted her into his arms.

Her body was warm and pliant against his, her soft hair brushing his jaw. His palm grew damp where it cradled her, his pulse erratic.

A soft sigh escaped her lips, like a contented child nestling deeper into his embrace.

His throat went dry.

He wanted to kiss her.

His lips hovered dangerously close to hers—but he stopped himself.

He had thought he married a naive girl.

But she was a wildfire, burning through every defense he had.

The next morning, Isabella stretched luxuriously in bed, blinking awake.

She had slept surprisingly well.

Wait—

Her eyes snapped open.

She was in the bed.

What the hell?

Had she sleepwalked?

She threw off the covers, relieved to find her clothes undisturbed. The narrow single bed couldn't possibly have fit Lucas's imposing frame—and if it had, she would've felt it.

Speaking of which—

Lucas was gone.

Isabella punched the mattress with a frustrated growl.

Was that idiot running around with his injuries? Trying to get himself killed?

A knock sounded at the door.

"Isabella? You awake?"

Nathaniel's voice.

"Come in," she called, quickly smoothing her hair and moving to the sofa before he could get the wrong idea.

Nathaniel entered, balancing two sleek, high-end food containers in his hands.

"Sebastian and Oliver are on their way from Skyridge to Elmwood. They'll pick you up, have lunch, then Oliver heads back to Alderford."

Isabella rubbed her temples with a sigh.

She had worried her brothers again.

"What's that?" She nodded at the containers.

"Breakfast. Lucas had his assistant bring it." Nathaniel set them on the coffee table, his expression sour.

Outside the door, Preston sneezed. Who was bad-mouthing him?

Isabella frowned. "Where is Lucas?"

"Medical check-up."

She opened the container—and froze.

Inside was an array of Skyridge-style breakfast delicacies, each dish meticulously arranged, vibrant and fragrant.

And every single one was her favorite.

Her stomach growled.

"Apparently, Lucas sent someone to Skyridge at five in the morning to get this. The thermal lining kept it warm." Nathaniel unpacked the dishes robotically.

He knew Lucas was making his move.

And he hated it.

Isabella scoffed. "He's insane. Who asked him to do this?"

But she couldn't resist picking up a crystal shrimp dumpling and popping it into her mouth.

Nathaniel watched, lips pressed into a thin line.

"Good?"

A deep voice purred from the doorway.

Isabella choked.

The dumpling lodged in her throat.

She coughed violently, face flushing.

"Isabella!" Nathaniel rushed to pat her back.

Seeing another man's hands on her, Lucas's blood boiled.

Even knowing they were just friends, jealousy clawed at him.

His expression darkened as he strode forward—

But Isabella was already on her feet, storming toward him.

"What happened last night? Why was I in the bed?"

"I moved you. The sofa isn't comfortable."

His voice was low, intimate, sending an unwelcome shiver down her spine.

"I didn't ask you to!"

"Everything I do for you is necessary." His gaze held hers, unyielding.

Especially those damn eyes—few women could resist them.

Isabella scoffed. "Dream on, Lucas. You can charm the world, but not me."

Her eyes flicked over him. Dark blue tailored suit. The tie and brooch she had given him.

Her pulse stuttered.

"Are you discharging yourself?"

"Yes."

"No, you're not cleared—"

"Will you stay with me until I am?"

His smirk was infuriating.

Isabella gaped. "Are you delusional?"

Had she been too nice to this bastard?

"I don't want to be trapped here. And I don't want to be without you."

The defiance in his eyes was new—almost boyish.

But the intensity behind it wasn't.

For a moment, Isabella was thrown off balance.

"Isabella!"

Sebastian and Oliver appeared in the doorway, resplendent in their military uniforms.

Relief flooded her. She ignored Lucas, rushing to her brothers.

Lucas's jaw tightened.

Even if they were family, he wouldn't lose to them.

But every man in Isabella's life was exceptional. Now a colonel brother stood between them.

"Isabella, are you alright?" Oliver gripped her shoulders, scanning her for injuries.

"I'm fine. Let's go."

She tried to pull him away, but Oliver held firm.

"Sebastian, Nathaniel, take Isabella ahead. I'll catch up."

"Isabella," Sebastian murmured, steering her toward the door with a meaningful glance at Lucas. "Oliver can handle himself."

Reluctantly, she let herself be led out.

Lucas's gaze followed her until the door shut.

Then he remembered—she hadn't eaten.

He moved toward the food—

A hand slammed down on the container.

Oliver's icy stare met his.

The air crackled with tension.

"She hasn't eaten. I'm taking this to her."

"I'd rather she starves than eats anything from you," Oliver sneered. "You think a few sweet words and breakfast can undo what you did? That my sister is some pet you can win over with treats?"

Lucas's jaw clenched. "I was wrong. But I'll spend the rest of my life making it right."

He reached for the container—

Oliver hurled it to the floor.

The delicate dishes shattered.

Lucas's heart splintered with them.

"Stay away from my sister," Oliver hissed, finger jabbing at Lucas's chest. "Or next time, it'll be you broken on the ground."

"I won't give up."

Lucas's eyes burned. "I love her. No matter what you do, that won't change."

Oliver laughed coldly. "You think we're the obstacle? Even if we stepped aside, Isabella would never go back to you. You drained every drop of love she had. Last night meant nothing—she'd do the same for anyone who saved her life. Stop deluding yourself."

Lucas's fists trembled.

He refused to believe that.

After everything—the confrontations, the pain, the realization—he knew his love was real.

But the fear gnawed at him.

What if Oliver was right?

What if he was too late?

Oliver turned to leave—then paused.

"Oh, and Isabella mentioned you were military once." His lip curled. "You're a disgrace to the uniform."

The door slammed.

Lucas stood amidst the wreckage, his heart in ruins.

But his resolve?

Unshaken.
###Chapter 272

The hospital corridor stretched long and silent.

Lucas stood frozen outside the ward door, his gaze sweeping over the two rows of guards lining the hallway. Their rigid posture, unreadable expressions, and the sheer intensity of their presence sent an involuntary shiver down his spine.

The door swung open with a sharp click of polished boots against tile.

Sebastian stepped out, adjusting his military cap with practiced precision. Years of discipline had trained him to keep his emotions locked away, especially in front of outsiders.

"Salute!" The guards snapped to attention in perfect unison.

"Move out."

With that single command, Sebastian strode past Lucas, his retinue falling into step behind him.

The corridor plunged back into silence.

Lucas watched Sebastian's retreating figure—the sharp angles of his profile, the effortless authority in his stride, the quiet confidence that demanded respect. Even as a grown man, Lucas couldn't help but feel dwarfed by the sheer presence of someone like him.

The gap between them wasn't just status—it was something deeper, something unbridgeable.

Just as the thought settled, Nathaniel emerged, his steps heavy, his eyes shadowed.

"Nathaniel, you shouldn't be pushing yourself like this. In your condition, leaving the hospital is reckless!"

Lucas rushed forward to support him, only to be shrugged off with stubborn defiance. "I have no choice. If I don't return to the company, Dominic and Arabella will start asking questions. They'll use any excuse to undermine my authority. My hospitalization—my injuries—they can't become public knowledge—"

The strain of his argument with Sebastian finally took its toll. Nathaniel doubled over in a coughing fit, the sound hollow and painful.

Fear spiked through Lucas. His chest tightened at the sight, his eyes burning.

"Nathaniel, the company, the presidency—none of it matters more than your health!"

"Don't worry. I won't die." Nathaniel straightened with effort, forcing a steady breath. "I've survived worse than this over the years. I'm still here, aren't I?"

But when he remembered Sebastian's cutting words—You disgrace the uniform—his eyes darkened with something raw.

It wasn't fair.

That evening, Isabella had reserved the finest suite at The Grand Chateau, laying out an extravagant spread of wine and delicacies for Sebastian.

Oliver, Harrison, and Seraphina—all working or studying in Elmsworth—had rushed over. A rare gathering of siblings was always cause for celebration, and the atmosphere buzzed with warmth.

Yet, their joy was bittersweet. They'd barely reunited before having to say goodbye to Sebastian again. Regret hung heavy in the air, and Isabella, unable to hold back her emotions, drowned her sorrows in glass after glass of wine.

Her thoughts tangled in frustration. Why did Nathaniel like her?

Was it because of their shared ordeal on Misty Mountain? Or was it some misplaced guilt after learning she was the girl he'd saved thirteen years ago?

Or—worse—was he just fickle, shifting his affections from the delicate Valentina to her, the untouchable queen of thorns?

A cold smirk curled her lips.

So Valentina's betrayal hadn't cut as deep as she'd thought. He'd moved on to her so easily.

Pathetic.

"Isabella! I heard you went back to that damn mountain and nearly got yourself killed saving someone!" Oliver had gotten the full story from Adrian. Terrified, he yanked her into a crushing hug. "You little menace! You're going to give me a heart attack! If anything happens to you, I swear I'll never marry—I'll just follow you into the grave!"

"Oliver! You're suffocating her!" Sebastian intervened, prying him off as Isabella gasped for air.

"Wow. Dying for love is one thing, but dying for a sibling? That's new." Harrison smirked around a mouthful of steak.

Seraphina nearly choked on her drink, covering her mouth with a delicate hand.

Always the quiet one among her brothers, she wasn't used to such blunt teasing.

Adrian, ever the caretaker, patted her back while adding dryly, "Oliver, Isabella just survived a near-death experience. Stop saying things like 'little menace' and 'heart attack.' It's bad luck."

"Damn it, I'm just worried!"

Oliver had lost his grip on Isabella to Sebastian, but he refused to let go entirely, clinging to her hand like a lifeline.

What should have been a harmonious family dinner quickly devolved into a battle for their sister's attention.

"Speaking of which, Isabella, you risked your life for that woman. Didn’t she send a thank-you banner or something?" Harrison asked, curiosity piqued.

"I passed out right after. No idea what happened." Isabella shrugged, popping another shrimp into her mouth—peeled, of course, by Sebastian.

"Oh, there was a banner." Adrian wiped his mouth with a napkin.

Everyone turned to him in surprise. Isabella, mid-bite, blinked. "What?"

"I left my number with Ranger Captain Sean. He called me two days ago. The woman you saved came by in a wheelchair with her family. They brought a banner and wanted to thank you personally. Unfortunately, they didn’t know your name—just called you 'the kind stranger.'"

"You gave Sean your number? So—"

"Yes. Both Professor Leo, whom you respect so much, and Captain Sean now know exactly who you are."

Adrian gave her a knowing look. "Neither of them was particularly shocked to learn you're the Sinclair heiress. They just asked me to take care of you—as any brother should. They also mentioned your donations to Misty Mountain Park over the years have been more than enough. Professor Leo stored everything in the maintenance fund, and they genuinely can't spend it all. They appreciate your generosity but asked you to stop donating. And, most importantly, they want you to take better care of yourself and stop volunteering so recklessly."

"Adrian!" Isabella set down her fork, pouting.

He sighed, equal parts fond and exasperated. "Isabella, your identity as a Sinclair shouldn’t be a secret. We don’t want it to be. You're our sister—Father's favorite. Even if some people know now, it's inevitable. If you ever take over the family business, stepping into the public eye is unavoidable. You need to get used to it."

"Wait." Her eyes lit up. "Adrian, are you saying I passed Father's test? Am I finally done with the 'grassroots experience'? Can I join the corporate world now?"

The thought lifted her spirits, washing away the lingering irritation from that infuriating man.

After all, right now, she had two goals: climbing the corporate ladder and destroying her so-called husband. The latter was already in motion. Time to focus on the former.

Adrian chuckled. "I know you're eager, but patience. Father's busy. Once he wraps up his current commitments, he'll give you the final assessment."

"Honestly, Father's being too strict. It's a family business. One word from him, and Isabella's in!" Harrison stuffed another piece of steak into his mouth like a starved man.

Adrian sighed. Isabella and Seraphina exchanged glances.

Oliver cleared his throat. "Harrison, are you implying it's not as simple as Father saying one word?"

"Huh? Yeah, that's what I meant!" Harrison grinned, utterly unbothered.

"Well, then, a toast to our sister first."

Seraphina stood, cheeks flushed, wine glass raised. "To your promotion, Isabella. May all your wishes come true."

"Now that's what I like to hear. Cheers!" Isabella grinned, downing her wine and blowing Seraphina a playful kiss.

Seraphina turned even pinker.

"Come on, everyone! A toast to Isabella! May all her dreams come true!"

Glasses clinked. Laughter filled the room. The warmth of family wrapped around her, and for a moment, Isabella's eyes stung.

The dinner ended in high spirits.

Isabella and Sebastian clung to each other. They'd joked and laughed all evening, but now, faced with goodbye, their eyes were red.

Sebastian's base was in Azeroth City—not far.

But his position meant he could be gone for months at a time, making his visits rare.

"Sebastian, will you be back for Genevieve's birthday?" Isabella reached up, fingers brushing the insignia on his uniform before adjusting his cap.

"I'm sorry, Isabella."

Regret flickered in his eyes as he pinched her cheek, then turned to Seraphina. "I'm sorry, Seraphina. Please tell Genevieve I'm sorry."

"No, it's okay! We understand!" Seraphina waved her hands frantically.

"But I already got her a gift." Sebastian smiled faintly. "Isabella, when the time comes, give it to her for me?"

"Of course."

In the hotel's underground garage, Sebastian's bulletproof car—specially driven from Azeroth City—waited.

His aide held the door open. After final goodbyes, Sebastian slid inside, rolling down the window for one last warning.

"Stay away from Nathaniel. Let him deal with his own mess. Understood?"

"Got it! Bye, Sebastian!"

Isabella grinned, eyes sparkling, lips red—looking, in that moment, even more adorable than the naturally gentle Seraphina.

After Sebastian left, Oliver and Harrison returned to work.

Isabella, slightly tipsy, asked Adrian to take her home.

"Miss Isabella, let me escort you." Preston stepped forward without hesitation.

Caring for her was second nature to him.

"But if you leave, who's taking care of Seraphina? She's had a bit too much to drink too!"

Isabella looped an arm around Seraphina's slender waist and, with surprising strength (thanks to the alcohol), shoved the petite woman straight into Preston's arms.

Seraphina, already unsteady, nearly stumbled—

But Preston caught her effortlessly, pulling her flush against his chest.

Their eyes met.

Breaths tangled.

Hearts skipped.
###Chapter 273

The alcohol had left Isabella Sinclair pleasantly lightheaded, but the moment Nathaniel Kingsley's hand closed around her wrist, all traces of intoxication vanished.

Her delicate features—flushed cheeks, the tips of her ears, the graceful curve of her neck—all bloomed with a soft, rosy hue.

"Careful, Ms. Isabella."

Nathaniel mistook her unsteadiness for drunkenness. Concern darkened his gaze as his strong arms encirhered her slender waist, pulling her closer.

Then, his throat went dry.

Her waist was impossibly soft beneath his touch, sending a jolt of awareness through him. But Nathaniel was a man of discipline, not one to succumb to fleeting desire. He schooled his expression into neutrality, betraying nothing.

"Nathaniel, I'm leaving my sister in your hands tonight!"

Evelyn Prescott, ever perceptive, hadn't noticed the tension between them. With a careless wave, she looped her arm through Alexander Kingsley's and sauntered away, leaving the two alone in an awkward silence.

"Evelyn—" Isabella called after her, voice trembling, her pulse erratic.

"Don't worry, Isabella."

Nathaniel's voice was gentle, reassuring. "I promised your sister I'd see you home safely."

"That's not necessary, Nathaniel. I only had a little to drink. I'm fine." She tried to push away lightly, eager to prove her sobriety.

But Nathaniel wasn't convinced. He steadied her again. "You said the same thing last time, and yet—"

They both froze.

The memory of that heated kiss, shared in the haze of another drunken night, crashed over them.

Nathaniel's gaze lingered on Isabella's face—pale as porcelain, tinged with that telltale blush. His chest tightened with an unfamiliar ache.

"Nathaniel, last time... I was drunk. I'm sorry."

Isabella's voice was small, guilt shadowing her eyes.

A bolder woman might have seized this moment to confess her feelings. But Isabella, raised to be timid and reserved by her mother Eleanor, could only bury her emotions deep.

Even if Nathaniel was kind, even if their kiss had been real—she could never lay claim to the man her sister had once loved.

"Ms. Isabella." Nathaniel's voice roughened. He swallowed. "Was that... your first kiss?"

"Don't dwell on it, Nathaniel. I was drunk. It meant nothing." She forced a smile.

"But was it?"

Guilt gnawed at him.

He took a deliberate step back and bowed deeply. "I owe you an apology, Isabella. I was careless. Tell me—how can I make this right?"

Her heart stuttered.

Seeing him consumed by guilt, treating her with nothing but distant respect—it felt like swallowing glass.

"It's fine, really."

She inhaled shakily, blinking back tears as she reached out to lift him from his bow. "If you truly want to make it up to me... just be good to Evelyn from now on."

On the drive back, Evelyn leaned against Alexander's shoulder, drowsy.

She wanted to ask what Sebastian had said to Thaddeus.

But she didn't. Whatever it was, it wouldn't have been kind. Sebastian had a tongue sharper than a blade—sometimes, even crueler than her own.

She didn't want to hear how he'd torn Thaddeus apart. Not out of pity, but because she couldn't bear to see the man she'd once loved humiliated by those closest to her.

"Evelyn, still awake?" Alexander murmured.

"Mm. What is it?"

"Have you noticed something... odd between Nathaniel and Isabella?"

Evelyn blinked.

"There's a tension between them. An... ambiguity."

Ambiguity?

Evelyn's eyes widened. "Alexander, are you drunk? Is this a joke?"

"I don't joke about matters of the heart. Earlier, when Nathaniel was helping her—their expressions were telling. Especially Isabella. The way she looked at him... it reminded me of how you once looked at Thaddeus."

Evelyn stiffened. "Why bring me into this?"

But her mind raced, replaying every interaction between Nathaniel and Isabella.

When had this happened? How had she missed it?

"Nathaniel isn't getting any younger. He's been working tirelessly since university—first for me, now for you. He's overdue for a life beyond work."

Alexander's arm tightened around her. "If he wants to pursue something—or someone—I hope you'll support him."

Evelyn scoffed. "So the loyal puppy has fangs after all! Men really are all the same. One minute he's confessing to me, the next he's eyeing my sister? If he dares hurt her, I'll feed him to the wolves!"

"Wait—Nathaniel confessed to you?" Alexander arched a brow.

"Obviously. I turned him down. He's a good man, but I'm not interested. I won't string him along. But Isabella? That's too fast. I won't let her get hurt."

"Evelyn, Nathaniel isn't fickle. Perhaps... his feelings for you blurred into something else. You've been his first love, his focus for years. Maybe he didn't even realize when his heart shifted."

"That's ridiculous. How can you not know when you've fallen for someone?"

"Emotions are complicated." Alexander's gaze turned thoughtful. "Take Thaddeus. After everything, after he saved your life again—can you honestly say there's no love left? Only hate?"

Evelyn's breath hitched.

Memories flooded her—Thaddeus, bleeding, carrying her through the storm. Stripping off his clothes to keep her warm in that freezing cave.

Her chest burned.

Why?

Why could he be so selfless for Evelyn, yet so cruel to Isabella?

"Alexander, you know me. I don't do gray areas. Whatever tangled mess I feel for Thaddeus, there's no love left. I won't make the same mistake twice."

Her voice cracked as she stared out the window. "Burning myself for love once was enough."

Nathaniel drove Isabella back to campus in silence.

The Porsche glided to a stop beneath the silver glow of the moon.

Neither moved to exit.

"Thank you for the ride, Mr. Kingsley," Isabella finally whispered.

"Nathaniel is fine." His voice was stiff, formal. "I may have watched you grow up, but I'm just Evelyn's secretary. Your brothers are the Ashbourne heirs. I'm... beneath you."

Isabella flinched.

She heard the unspoken distance in his words. Tears pricked her eyes.

"Nathaniel, I won't trouble you anymore. Just... don't hate me, okay?"

"Ms. Isabella, you misunderstand. You're no trouble. I just... don't want to complicate your life."

He exhaled, leaning over to unbuckle her seatbelt.

Their breaths mingled. The air between them grew thick.

Nathaniel averted his eyes, straightening abruptly. "It's late. I'll walk you in."

He stepped out.

Isabella's chest hollowed.

That kiss had been a mistake.

How could a man like Nathaniel ever want someone like her?

She was fooling herself.

The passenger door opened. Nathaniel waited, ever the gentleman.

Isabella stepped out, lips pale.

"I can go alone—ah!"

A roaring engine cut her off. She clapped her hands over her ears, eyes squeezing shut—traumatized by childhood memories of screeching tires.

Nathaniel moved instantly.

He wrapped her in his arms, shielding her with his body as a silver Ferrari tore past, its wake ruffling his suit jacket.

"Shh. I've got you."

His voice was soft, soothing as he stroked her trembling back. Half his gaze was tender; the other half burned with fury at the reckless driver.

The Ferrari screeched to a halt.

The passenger door swung open.

A pair of long, toned legs emerged, followed by a woman—auburn curls, smoldering makeup, a skirt that left little to the imagination.
###Chapter 274

The instant Isabella spotted that woman, her pupils constricted violently. A cold sweat drenched her back as she trembled harder in Nathaniel's embrace.

The woman—Vanessa—had been her classmate, always hostile toward her. She tormented Isabella relentlessly, bullying and humiliating her at every turn. Suddenly, Nathaniel recalled Isabella mentioning her paralyzing fear of crossing streets, how speeding cars sent terror through her.

Years ago, when Arabella married Reginald, they had many young children. Some, envious of the Sinclair family's power, couldn't strike at Reginald directly—so they targeted his children instead.

Back then, they believed Arabella was the least favored wife, her children the least cherished. They sent someone to attack seven-year-old Isabella, vowing to make Chairman Reginald suffer the agony of losing a child.

Though Isabella survived with only minor injuries, and Reginald destroyed the rival family, the trauma left deep scars on her heart.

The memory made Nathaniel's breath hitch. Fury surged through him.

"Miss Sinclair, are you alright?"

"I'm fine." Isabella forced a smile, trying to appear composed.

But her pale face and the cold sweat on her forehead betrayed her terror.

Just then, Vanessa sauntered toward them.

Seeing Isabella in the arms of such a striking man, Vanessa's eyes darkened with poorly concealed envy.

Her gaze shifted to the Porsche he drove—worth barely a hundred grand. Her sneer twisted into open disdain.

"Pathetic trash."

Her voice was low, but both Nathaniel and Isabella heard it.

Nathaniel's eyes burned crimson. "Miss Sinclair, wait here. I'll handle this."

"N-No, Nathaniel!"

But it was too late. He was already striding toward Vanessa, his expression icy.

"Who were you referring to just now?"

"Did I say anything? You must be hearing things." Vanessa eyed the handsome man before her, her tone less biting but still arrogant. Nathaniel clenched his fists.

He knew she'd insulted Isabella, but she wouldn't admit it—and he couldn't hit a woman.

Infuriating.

"Mr. Vanderbilt, thank you for the ride! I'll be waiting for your next invitation." Vanessa blew a kiss toward the darkened car window, her voice sickeningly sweet.

Mr. Vanderbilt?

Sebastian Vanderbilt, CEO of Vanderbilt Industries?

Nathaniel frowned. The car remained motionless, its tinted windows impenetrable. The engine revved mockingly.

Fueled by rage for Isabella, he knocked on the window.

"Your car nearly hit my sister. You think you can just drive off?"

Isabella bit her lip, dread pooling in her stomach.

She didn't want Nathaniel confronting Vanessa on her behalf. She wanted no conflict with that woman!

Still, no response came from inside the car.

"Excuse me? The road is wide enough. When did Mr. Vanderbilt's car even come close to you?" Vanessa crossed her arms, sneering. "Trying to scam us? How low can you sink?"

Nathaniel's jaw tightened, but before he could retort, the window rolled down halfway.

Thud.

A wad of cash was flung at him, scattering like trash—a blatant insult.

"You—!"

Nathaniel glared at the figure inside, but the Ferrari roared away, vanishing into the night.

Watching him humiliated, Isabella trembled with fury.

"Here, bro—a gift from Mr. Vanderbilt. Take it."

With Sebastian gone, Vanessa dropped all pretense.

She pressed herself against Nathaniel, fingers trailing his collar. "You're too refined for someone like Isabella. She's notorious. Cheap. You're wasting your time. Or maybe—Ah!"

Nathaniel stepped back sharply.

Vanessa stumbled, her heels skidding. She crashed to her knees—bowing deeply before them.

Isabella stifled a laugh.

"Damn it! That hurts!"

Vanessa, clad in a miniskirt in the cold, felt her knees might shatter. Tears welled as she looked up at Nathaniel pitifully. "Help me up? I can't stand..."

"Can't stand? I thought you were apologizing to my sister." Nathaniel smirked, arrogance dripping from his tone. "But fine. I'll accept it as your apology."

Vanessa seethed, fists clenching.

She was Sebastian Vanderbilt's woman! How dare he speak to her like that? And Isabella, laughing? She'd pay for this!

"Let's go."

Nathaniel guided Isabella away, his arm protective around her. Before leaving, he tossed over his shoulder, "The world's dangerous. Even at school, you're not safe. Stay away from women who are cheap, dirty, and full of themselves."

"Got it." Isabella gazed at him, admiration sparkling in her eyes.

He'd stood up for her.

She'd be too exhilarated to sleep tonight.

Nathaniel escorted her all the way to her dorm, ensuring her safety.

At the door, Isabella pressed her hands against the glass, watching him leave like a lovestruck girl after a date. Her cheeks flushed, heart aching with longing.

"When will I see you again, Nathaniel?"

Only when he disappeared did she sigh, turning toward her room.

"Isabella! You shameless bitch!"

Vanessa's shriek made her pulse spike.

Fear flickered—Vanessa and her clique had made Isabella's university life hell. She'd endured it, wanting only to graduate in peace.

But then she remembered Sebastian's insult to Nathaniel, Vanessa's advances toward the man she loved. Fear dissolved into white-hot rage.

Isabella's expression frosted over. She ignored Vanessa and kept walking.

"Whore! Stop right there!"

Isabella halted. Slowly, she turned.

Vanessa limped toward her, knee bloodied, panting with fury. Isabella couldn't help but smile.

"Who are you calling a bitch?"

"You! Obviously!"

"Oh. I thought you were introducing yourself."

Vanessa gaped.

"And before calling someone else cheap, maybe check your own reflection." Isabella's voice was razor-sharp. "The man you're chasing—Sebastian Vanderbilt—is married. Everyone knows his wife is stunning. I can't imagine what he sees in you. A man of his caliber shouldn't have such poor taste."

"You know nothing!" Vanessa screeched. "I'm young, beautiful, irresistible! It's natural he'd want me!"

"After a lifetime of delicacies, I suppose even garbage can seem refreshing."

"Garbage? Who are you—?"

"You. Obviously." Isabella threw Vanessa's own words back at her.

Vanessa, outmatched, raised her hand—

Crack!

The slap burned across Isabella's cheek, swelling instantly.

This wasn't the first time. During university, Vanessa had used plays, performances—even colluded with teachers—to cast Isabella in roles where she'd be abused. All for her own sick satisfaction.

Vanessa smirked. "Think some rich boy in a Porsche makes you untouchable?"

Isabella just stared, amused by her delusion.

The Vanderbilts were her family's longtime business partners. She'd been held by Sebastian's father as a child.

"Then I hope you succeed in ruining me. If Sebastian still considers you his side dish by then."

"You—!"

As Isabella turned to leave, she paused. "Oh. This is for you."

Before Vanessa could react—

Smack!

Isabella's slap struck harder, fiercer.

"You dare hit me?!" Vanessa clutched her cheek, stunned. The meek Isabella fighting back?

"Why not? Do I need your permission?"

Isabella lifted her chin, eyes glinting with icy regality. Vanessa shuddered. "That was for every time you thought you owned me. I didn't retaliate before because you weren't worth my time. And the man in the Porsche? He's mine. Touch him again, and I'll make your life hell."
###Chapter 275

The moment Alexander Kingsley was discharged from the hospital, the mountain of work waiting for him consumed three sleepless nights. His health remained unstable, sustained only by the IV drips and medications Isabella Sinclair had prepared. He needed to recover quickly—how else could he protect those he loved in this weakened state?

"Mr. Kingsley, it's time for your medication," Sebastian Lockwood announced, placing a tray with pills and mineral water in front of him.

Alexander barely glanced up from the documents. "Later."

Sebastian crossed his arms. "If you refuse, I'll have to inform Mrs. Sinclair immediately. She made it clear—any deviation from your treatment plan, and she's to be notified at once."

With a reluctant sigh, Alexander swallowed the bitter pills, grimacing. His fingers fumbled in the drawer for the chocolate bar Isabella had left behind—his secret comfort stash.

"What's the latest on Mrs. Sinclair?" he asked, the sweetness barely masking the medicine's aftertaste.

"Chairman Emeric's daughter, Myra, is celebrating her birthday soon. Mrs. Sinclair is overseeing the arrangements at the Windsor Estates."

Alexander's brow lifted. "The retired actress?"

"Yes! My mother adored her. She used to replicate Myra's outfits from her dramas." Sebastian sighed. "Such a shame she left the industry so abruptly."

"Why did she retire?"

"A drug scandal. Chairman Emeric cleared her name, but the damage was done." Sebastian smirked. "Though, I must say, Chairman Emeric has a way with women. Always swooping in as the savior when they're most vulnerable. No woman can resist that."

Alexander's jaw tightened.

Sebastian pressed on, undeterred. "Honestly, sir, your father handled multiple wives effortlessly. Yet here you are, struggling with just one. Maybe you should consult Chairman Emeric for advice?"

Alexander's glare could have shattered glass. "Are you suggesting I ask him how to handle his own daughter? Have you lost your mind?"

Sebastian coughed. "I'm just concerned. At this glacial pace, will I live to see you two reconcile? You saved her life, yet she hasn't visited once. Back then, she'd prepare feasts and wait at the gates for your return."

A shadow crossed Alexander's face. "It doesn't matter. No matter how she treats me now, I won't give up."

A knock interrupted them. "Mr. Kingsley, Mr. Daniel Carter is here."

"Let him in."

Daniel strolled in, humming, his white suit unbuttoned to reveal a tanned chest, a platinum chain glinting against his skin. Only he could pull off such audacious elegance.

"Looking alive, brother-in-law," Daniel drawled, collapsing onto the couch. "Seems my sister's remedies worked wonders."

Alexander's pulse jumped at brother-in-law, but his expression remained cool. "If you're going to dress like that, stay out of Imperial Entertainment. This is a workplace, not a nightclub."

Daniel blinked. "Excuse me?"

"I don't need rumors about my preferences."

Sebastian choked back laughter.

Daniel's eyes narrowed. "I'm straight as an arrow! Even if you begged, I wouldn't—"

"Enough," Alexander cut in. "What do you want?"

Daniel flourished an invitation with a smug grin. "From Isabella herself. Myra's birthday party."

Alexander's fingers twitched. "And?"

"Did you get one?"

Alexander's temper flared—always a weak spot where Isabella was concerned.

"Relax, I'm teasing." Daniel produced another crumpled invite. "This one's from your wicked stepmother. Funny coincidence—she moved her birthday to the same day. Seems she's itching for a showdown with Myra."

Alexander frowned. "Elspeth's birthday isn't this weekend."

"Exactly. She's clearly trying to upstage Myra."

"Is there history between them?"

"Not sure. But back in their acting days, Myra was always the lead. Elspeth? Perpetual second fiddle."

Alexander's gaze darkened. "Monitor Elspeth. Any moves, report to me immediately."

Meanwhile, at The Regal Palace...

Elspeth and Glynnis sifted through a sea of discarded gowns, each more extravagant than the last.

"Disgusting!" Glynnis kicked a dress aside. "These are supposed to be this season's highlights? Even a stray dog wouldn't wear them!"

Elspeth drained her wine, seething. Thanks to Isabella, her reputation had crumbled. Luxury brands now refused to lend her so much as a hairpin.

"Mom, if you can't secure a stunning gown, this plan will backfire," Glynnis fretted.

Elspeth slammed her glass down. "Who would dare laugh at me? I'm the Abernathy matriarch! Myra? Just a washed-up concubine!"

"Right, of course!"

Elspeth stood abruptly. "Contact Haron. I want one of his designs—no matter the cost."

K Windsor Hotel.
###Chapter 276

The afternoon sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of Isabella Sinclair's office, casting long shadows across her meticulously organized desk. Her fingers traced over the banquet layout with a precision that surpassed even her previous work for Evelyn Prescott's wedding.

Back then, her dedication had been purely professional—Evelyn was a crucial business partner. This time, it was personal. Seraphina Lockwood was family.

"Miss Sinclair, you've been pushing yourself too hard. Three sleepless nights in a row isn't healthy," murmured Oliver Bennett, her ever-loyal assistant, setting down a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. The constant caffeine intake worried him.

"I can't stop now. The venue is ready, but Seraphina's gown isn't finished yet." Isabella set aside the documents, rubbing her throbbing temples.

Most women her age would be jet-setting across Europe or indulging in romantic escapades. But here she was, drowning in spreadsheets and performance reports, strategizing ways to elevate the Sinclair Grand's reputation.

Strong as she was, she wasn't invincible. Exhaustion clung to her like a second skin.

"Arrange the car. I need to visit Henri Delacroix's atelier."

"Is this about finalizing Seraphina's dress?"

"Yes. If we don't work through the night, we'll miss the deadline."

Oliver sighed, sympathy tightening his chest.

Just then, his phone buzzed.

A WhatsApp notification from Dominic Blackwood—guest list for Seraphina's birthday gala, with a terse note: Forward to Miss Sinclair.

Oliver scanned the names. The first few entries made his blood boil: the three Chambers brothers.

Memories of Nathaniel Sterling throwing cash at him, that vulgar woman sneering at Ms. Lockwood—rage burned behind his eyes.

"Oliver, is there an issue with the list? You look furious," Isabella remarked, sharp gaze catching his tension.

"There's something you should know."

He recounted the incident from that night, omitting Nathaniel's humiliation.

He'd wanted to handle it himself, but realized this wasn't just some petty squabble.

He was just an assistant. Powerless against Nathaniel's influence.

If that woman attended the same university as Ms. Lockwood, the harassment wouldn't stop. He needed Isabella's intervention.

Isabella's delicate brows knitted together, her usually warm eyes turning glacial.

"That woman is nothing but Nathaniel's discarded plaything. How dare she lay a finger on my sister?"

Her palm slammed against the desk. "She won't get away with this!"

Oliver almost smiled.

"That wench acts bold because she thinks Nathaniel shields her." Isabella's almond-shaped eyes glinted dangerously. "If she knew Seraphina has the entire Sinclair empire behind her, she'd be groveling for mercy. Let's see if Mr. Sterling dares defend her then."

"So... you'll deal with her?" Oliver ventured.

Isabella scoffed, swirling her juice. "She's not worth my time. When you strike a dog, you aim for its master. This debt falls on Nathaniel."

"But Miss Sinclair, Nathaniel might not know—"

"I don't care." She cut him off, voice razor-sharp. "I'm vicious when it comes to protecting mine. Ignorance isn't an excuse. Not with me."

That evening, Isabella dismissed Oliver and drove alone to Henri's atelier.

"Alea! The muse graces my humble studio!" Henri greeted her with a theatrical bow, grinning.

She'd thought her mentor being a Sinclair heiress under the alias Haron was impressive enough.

But Alea? That revelation had stunned her.

In fashion circles, Alea and Haron were legends.

"Alright, enough teasing. How do I make it up to you?" Isabella looped an arm around Henri's waist.

"Visit more often," Henri pouted. "Don't just appear when you need favors."

"Please, I'm not that heartless." She flicked Henri's nose. "Once this is over, we'll vacation wherever you want. My treat."

Henri's eyes sparkled. "You're the best!"

No time for small talk—Isabella marched straight to the studio's heart.

A mannequin stood center-stage, draped in a nearly completed gown of crimson and onyx chiffon. The bold contrast was mesmerizing, exuding regal elegance.

Under the spotlights, it looked divine.

Henri sighed dreamily. "This belongs in a celestial wardrobe. Even fairies would envy this masterpiece."

"You've stared at it for weeks. Not tired yet?" Isabella trailed her fingers over the delicate fabric, pride glowing in her eyes.

"Never." Henri admired the craftsmanship. "This 'liquid gold' silk chiffon—three washes, nine boils, eighteen sun-dryings. A single bolt takes a year to perfect. Only you could source something this exquisite. The market's current stock pales in comparison. This could auction for millions."

"It's from my private collection. Only the best for family."

Adjusting the sleeves, Isabella prepared to put the final touches on Seraphina's birthday masterpiece.

Downstairs, a sleek Maybach glided into the courtyard.

Richard Langley exited first, moving to open the door for Alexander Kingsley.

Spotting the La Voiture Noire parked prominently, he whistled.

"Mr. Kingsley! Mrs. Sinclair's here!"

Alexander's pulse jumped. He stepped out swiftly.

That unmistakable bumper sticker confirmed it—Isabella's car.

A boyish grin tugged at his lips. He checked his reflection in the window, straightening his Windsor knot.

Richard bit back a laugh. The usually unflappable Alexander Kingsley looked like a teenager prepping for prom.

"How do I look?" Alexander asked casually.

Richard gave a thumbs-up. "Sharp, sir."

Alexander frowned. "Just sharp?"

Realization dawned.

If he looked impeccable, Isabella would feel less guilty—less concerned.

But if he appeared worn out...

Ah. Clever.

At the entrance, an assistant blocked them.

"Henri is with a VIP. No interruptions."

Alexander's gaze hardened. "Is the VIP her mentor?"

The assistant blinked. "How did—"

"Because I'm here for her." He stepped closer. "I'm Mrs. Sinclair's husband. Surely a wife can't deny her husband entry?"

The assistant's lips thinned. "Mr. Kingsley, with all due respect—your engagement to Arabella Sterling was publicized months ago. Now you're claiming Henri's mentor is your wife? That's bold."

Arabella's name soured Alexander's mood.

Before he could retort, a sharp voice cut in.

"Alexander! What nonsense are you spouting?"

Henri stormed down the stairs, disbelief etched across her face.

"Your mentor, Isabella Sinclair, was my wife." He paused. "Once."

Henri gaped. "You're delusional. My mentor wouldn't waste a second on you!"

Alexander's jaw tightened.

Why had Isabella loved him?

That childhood rescue—she'd only been eleven. Could a child's gratitude really evolve into lifelong devotion?

"Henri, he's telling the truth."

All three turned.

Isabella leaned against the balcony railing, arms crossed, amusement dancing in her eyes.

"Forgive me. Everyone makes mistakes." Her smirk was razor-edged. "Who hasn't married the wrong man?"
###Chapter 277

Nathaniel's pulse hammered violently, his gaze softening as it landed on Isabella for the first time in what felt like forever.

Yet her words, sharp and laced with ice, cut through him like a blade. His vision blurred as he stared into her eyes—eyes that once held warmth but now brimmed with something unreadable. "Master!"

Vanessa's expression twisted in confusion at the sight of Isabella. A thousand questions burned in her mind, but none escaped her lips. "Nathaniel, what are you doing here?" Isabella asked, her tone detached.

The utter lack of warmth in her demeanor, as if their shared past and near-death experience meant nothing, sent Nathaniel's heart plummeting. Still, he answered with sincerity, "I came to see you."

"Spare me the lies. Do you even believe your own words?" A mocking smile curled Isabella's lips as she dismissed him entirely.

Nathaniel had no retort.

"That's enough. You've seen her. Now leave." Vanessa, visibly irritated, commanded him to go.

She despised this man—once entangled with a gold-digger, now trying to worm his way back into Isabella's life. His mere presence felt like a stain on their space.

"I'm not leaving." Nathaniel's eyes burned with determination.

"Do I need to fetch a baseball bat to make you?" Vanessa, usually composed in public, had no patience when it came to protecting those she loved.

"Isabella."

Her heart clenched at the sound of her name from his lips.

Ignoring Vanessa, Nathaniel kept his focus solely on Isabella. "I need to talk to you."

Isabella?

The nickname hung in the air, foreign yet intimate.

During their three years of marriage, he had always addressed her formally, sometimes skipping her name altogether. Daniel, standing nearby, nearly grinned—his boss was finally showing a change of heart!

"Watch your tone. You're divorced now, and my master clearly wants nothing to do with you. Address her properly—Ms. Sinclair."

"Say what you need to say."

Isabella issued the command coldly before turning to leave.

Nathaniel felt a flicker of hope. Despite his efforts to remain composed, the corners of his lips twitched upward. Without hesitation, he followed her.

Daniel barely contained his amusement, thoroughly enjoying the sight of Nathaniel fighting to win back his wife.

Vanessa, unable to stop him, redirected her frustration at Daniel with a lethal glare. "Stay outside. No one associated with Nathaniel is allowed in!"

Nathaniel caught up to Isabella effortlessly.

But she didn’t spare him a single glance. He was no longer the center of her universe.

And yet—it didn’t matter.

Her decision to let him stay meant his persistence hadn’t gone unnoticed. No matter how small the opening, he would seize it.

He had let her slip away once.

Now, he would fight to bring her back.

As they reached the studio door, Isabella stopped abruptly but didn’t turn around.

"Isabella."

"Who gave you the right to call me that?"

She finally faced him, her gaze glacial, devoid of any warmth. "You might not find it strange, but I find it repulsive."

"I just don’t want us to be strangers." Nathaniel’s chest tightened. He didn’t understand her anger.

The man who dominated boardrooms and international negotiations was now at a loss for words before the woman he loved.

"Mr. Kingsley, don’t call me that. It makes me feel like I’m on the same level as some cheap woman, and that’s an insult to my dignity." Her voice was sharp as frost.

Nathaniel’s lips pressed into a thin line, his throat burning with unspoken pain.

He realized the wounds he’d inflicted hadn’t healed. If anything, they had festered.

She wasn’t considering forgiveness. She was clinging to every scar and throwing them back at him.

"Isabella, when I call you that, it has nothing to do with anyone else," Nathaniel rasped, his voice rough.

"Enough."

She pushed the door open, cutting him off. "Don’t flatter yourself. I only brought you here because I know you. If I didn’t let you say your piece today, you’d never leave. I just didn’t want Vanessa to deal with you."

Nathaniel’s expression darkened as he watched her retreating figure.

She had only allowed him inside for one reason—Seraphina’s birthday was approaching. With her days packed, she could only work on the dress at night. Every second counted.

Isabella picked up a jade hairpin from the table and twisted her silken hair into a loose bun.

Nathaniel’s gaze softened, his fingers twitching with the urge to touch.

Her hair was thick, glossy—begging to be threaded through his fingers.

He remembered their honeymoon nights, how her restless sleeping had often sent strands spilling onto his side of the bed. Careful not to tug, he’d always gathered them gently.

A pang of sorrow hit him, his eyes reddening silently.

Back then, she had been within reach. Now, he didn’t even have the right to touch her.

"Hey."

Isabella held a safety pin between her lips as she bent over the dress, stitching decorations in place. "How have you been lately?"

"I’ve been fine." His voice was low, rough.

"Hmm."

Her fingers moved tirelessly, long lashes fluttering as she glanced at the man standing stiffly. "Aren’t you going to say what you came here to say? Spit it out."

Nathaniel hesitated.

"Cat got your tongue? If you’re wasting my time, I’ll have Vanessa throw you out."

His chest tightened. If he didn’t speak now, he’d lose his chance. Quickly, he said, "I came to ask Ms. Bennett about someone."

"Who?"

"Valentina."

Isabella’s expression remained neutral, but her fingertips trembled slightly. "Valentina? The world-renowned designer? What do you want with her?"

"I need her to come out of retirement and design a dress for me."

"She’s busy. Forget it." Isabella’s tone was dismissive, a scoff echoing in her mind.

This man—first trying to commission Arabella for jewelry, now Valentina for a dress. Does he think the world revolves around him?

Nathaniel frowned. "How do you know she’s busy? Do you know her?"

"Why do you want her to design a dress?" Isabella countered, evading the question.

"An acquaintance’s birthday is coming up. I want to gift them a custom design." His answer was vague.

He didn’t want to reveal it was for Seraphina—hoping to surprise her later.

But while his intentions were pure, Isabella’s interpretation was far from it.

A sardonic smile curved her lips. "Ah, right. This weekend is Mrs. Lockwood’s birthday. You’re using this chance to impress Mr. Lockwood and gift your stepmother, aren’t you? How thoughtful."

"Isabella." Nathaniel’s brows furrowed, displeasure flashing in his eyes.

It wasn’t her taunts that bothered him—it was being misunderstood.

"If you contact Valentina, don’t mention it’s for Victoria’s birthday. She might just curse you out."

Suppressing her irritation, Isabella turned away, no longer willing to look at him. "Are you done? Get out. I’m busy, and you’re distracting me. Ah!"

Distracted, she pricked her finger with the needle, a small gasp escaping her.

"What happened? Are you hurt?"

Nathaniel was at her side in an instant, concern flooding his gaze as he took her delicate hand.

A single drop of blood welled on her fingertip.

His expression darkened as if he’d felt the sting himself. "Does it hurt?"

"Let go." She tried to pull away, but his grip was firm.

The blood bloomed like a crimson rose against her skin, his eyes warming at the sight.

Then—before she could react—he brought her finger to his lips.

"You—!" Isabella’s eyes widened, her pulse skyrocketing.

The warmth of his mouth enveloped her finger, his tongue gently soothing the wound.

A jolt of electricity shot through her, spreading from her fingertip to every nerve.

Her breath hitched, cheeks flushing as her finger trembled uncontrollably in his grasp.

Feeling her shiver, Nathaniel’s eyes darkened, his lips brushing over her knuckles—alternating between featherlight and firm.

Their gazes locked, and Isabella’s legs weakened, her head spinning.

The heat in his eyes mirrored that passionate night under the moonlight—just as intoxicating.

Though they weren’t doing anything, it felt like everything.

Nathaniel’s breathing grew ragged, the air between them thickening.

"Enough!"

Panicked, Isabella yanked her hand back as if burned.

But as she stepped away, Nathaniel’s arm snaked around her waist, pulling her flush against him.

"Nathaniel! What do you think you’re doing?" Fear flickered in her eyes.

His heart pounded uncontrollably, gaze burning into hers. Their bodies pressed together, heartbeats and heat merging.

"Isabella, I want to kiss you." The confession was raw, his desire laid bare.

"Don’t—"

Her protest died as his lips crashed onto hers, swallowing her words, parting her lips with relentless hunger.

And then—he deepened the kiss, claiming her completely.
###Chapter 278

The dying sunlight poured through the windows, painting their tangled shadows in molten gold. The air between them was thick with desire, their kiss as intoxicating as aged wine.

Isabella's cheeks burned under Alexander's relentless assault. Every nerve in her body sparked to life, her skin tingling where his hands roamed.

At first, she fought. Her fists struck his chest, his shoulders—anything to push him away. But his dominance was overwhelming. Her strength melted, her breath stolen, her knees buckling as she stumbled back.

Crash!

He pinned her against the desk, sending papers and trinkets scattering across the floor.

A soft whimper escaped her lips, a sound caught between protest and surrender. Alexander's gaze darkened, his ears flushing crimson. He was burning up, consumed by the wildfire she ignited in him.

He had only ever kissed one woman like this. Only her.

And he swore he would never touch another.

"Master!"

The door flew open. Olivia barged in, freezing mid-step at the sight of them tangled together.

"What the hell, Alexander? Get off her!"

Isabella shoved him away, her almond-shaped eyes wide with shock. Then—SMACK!

The slap echoed through the room. Alexander's cheek stung, already swelling. Olivia gaped.

Yet, despite the pain, his lips curled into a smirk.

"Get out," Isabella hissed, her voice trembling. "I don’t want to see you."

Her lips were still swollen from his kiss, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. The sight only deepened his amusement.

"Fine. I’ll leave." He stepped back, his gaze lingering. "But I’ll be back when you’re done working."

Her breath hitched. Who said she wanted that?

With one last glance, he strode past Olivia, leaving behind the faint scent of winter pine.

"Master! Are you okay?" Olivia rushed to her side, fury and concern warring in her eyes.

"I’m fine." Isabella exhaled sharply, pressing a hand to her racing heart. "Just consider it a dog bite."

Olivia blinked. By the time she processed the insult, Alexander was already gone.

"Master, tell me the truth—are you still hung up on him?"

"No." The answer came too fast. Isabella hugged her tightly, her voice hollow. "I divorced him. If I can’t move on now, I don’t deserve to call myself a person."

For thirteen years, she had sacrificed everything for him. No more. She wouldn’t repeat the same mistakes.

"Exactly! Smart women don’t cry over men—they grill steaks!" Olivia grinned, squeezing her shoulders. "Let’s go out tonight. Drinks. Barbecue. And I want all the juicy details of your tragic love life!"

"My love life is just a pile of bad decisions." Isabella forced a laugh, then smirked. "But what about you? Any hot guys lately?"

"Please. I’m too busy designing." Olivia scoffed. "Those pretty-faced models? Useless. Last one asked me to buy him a Rolex. Like I’m his sugar mama!"

Isabella snorted. "Guess we’re both suckers. But don’t worry—I’ve got connections. Want me to set you up?"

"Wait, you? With your schedule?"

"Born with the privilege." She winked. "My brothers—Sebastian, Nathaniel, Oliver, and Lucas—all single. I’ll print their profiles. Pick your type."

Olivia burst out laughing. "This feels like ordering from a male escort catalog."

"Except my brothers are hotter." Isabella grinned. "Nathaniel’s a prosecutor. Charming. Articulate. Totally your type."

Olivia’s jaw dropped.

Meanwhile, Alexander stepped outside, still dazed. The memory of her lips haunted him.

"Mr. Kingsley!" Gordon hurried over, shivering.

Up close, Alexander looked… different. His usually sharp eyes were soft, his lips slightly swollen, his cheeks flushed.

Gordon’s face heated. "Sir, your—your face?"

"Isabella slapped me." He touched his cheek, smiling.

"What? Why?"

Alexander’s grin widened. "Because she cares."

Three days until the banquet.

Elsewhere, Elspeth’s last hope shattered.

Haron refused to design her dress.

"She won’t take the commission," Glynnis whispered. "No matter the price."

"Why?"

Glynnis hesitated. "She said… she doesn’t dress women with ‘tainted reputations.’ It’ll ruin her brand."

Elspeth’s face twisted. "That arrogant seamstress! I don’t need her! I’ll outshine Myra without her!"

Silence.

"Dad?" Glynnis stiffened.

Frederic stood in the doorway, his expression icy.

Elspeth forced a smile. "Darling, you’re back!"

"What’s this mess?" He eyed the shattered vase.

"Haron insulted me! She humiliated the Abernathy name!" Elspeth clutched his arm, tears welling. "You must boycott her! Teach her a lesson!"

Frederic scoffed. "Boycott an international designer? Grow up."

He turned to Glynnis. "Leave us."

Once alone, his voice dropped. "Why did you move your birthday to compete with Myra? Stirring up old drama?"

Elspeth’s nails dug into her palms. "That past has nothing to do with me! She was the one humiliated!"

"You’re delusional."

"Or are you still hung up on her?" Her laugh was bitter. "After all, twenty years ago, your affair with her was the scandal of the century."
###Chapter 279

Nathaniel's gaze sharpened, his voice cutting like ice. "What the hell are you implying? What does Isabella have to do with me?"

"Years ago, before you even knew me, you were the silent investor behind Starlight Media. That was when Isabella was rising to fame! The tabloids claimed you were her sugar daddy. You were even photographed meeting her in secret. Are you seriously denying there was anything between you?"

Every time Evelyn thought of Isabella, she couldn't help but bring it up, her emerald eyes burning with fury.

Back then, she chose Nathaniel not just because he was the heir to the Vanderbilt Group, but because rumors swirled that he was the man behind Isabella. She wanted to take everything Isabella had.

And if she couldn’t, she’d destroy it with her own hands.

Nathaniel frowned, anger simmering in his dark eyes. "There was nothing between Isabella and me."

Evelyn flinched under his glare, her confidence wavering.

"Let’s say, hypothetically, there was something between us. Do you think I would’ve left her to marry you? I’m not the kind of man who keeps a mistress hidden away, too cowardly to bring her home."

Evelyn’s breath hitched, her throat tightening as if strangled.

On the surface, his words seemed reasonable.

But they stung like a slap to the face.

It felt like she was just a replacement—that Nathaniel had settled for her.

"So you did have feelings for her back then," Evelyn accused, her voice trembling. "You still haven’t let her go, have you?"

She gripped his arm, tears welling in her eyes. "Nathaniel! That woman is trash! She slept her way through the industry, ruined her career with drugs—any man associated with her would be dragged down too! She’s nothing but a disgrace, fit only to be Adrian’s dirty little secret!"

Nathaniel’s chest tightened at her words.

Yes, he had met Isabella before Evelyn.

And at that time, in terms of talent, beauty, and reputation, Evelyn paled in comparison.

In his memory, Isabella wasn’t the vile creature Evelyn described. Even after the scandal that forced her out of the industry, he believed she’d been framed. He never looked down on her for it.

"I know the kind of person Isabella is. And if she was truly as terrible as you claim, do you think Adrian would’ve married her?"

Nathaniel’s expression turned colder. "Back then, I pitied her. She was bullied, ostracized—yet she never complained. As a shareholder and her boss, it was only natural to look out for her. I don’t understand why you’re dredging up old rumors now. I married you because you understood me, because you were supposed to be better than this. If you keep fixating on the past, maybe I was wrong about you. Maybe I made a mistake."

Evelyn’s eyes widened in shock, her face twisting in disbelief.

His words were daggers, each one carving deeper into her heart.

"Nathaniel. I’ve stood by you through everything. I carried your child, endured the humiliation of being your secret—all because I loved you. How can you say these things to me?"

When her tears began to fall, Nathaniel’s resolve softened. He exhaled heavily, gently patting her trembling back.

"Stop crying. I was too harsh. Forget it."

In the past, Evelyn wouldn’t have been so easily appeased. But times had changed. She knew when to retreat.

So she swallowed her rage, melting against him like a wilting flower. "Nathaniel, don’t be angry with me. I just love you too much—I’m terrified of losing you."

With that, she pressed her tear-stained lips to his in a desperate kiss.

Nathaniel was exhausted, and after weeks of tension, this moment of warmth was a fleeting comfort. The anger in his eyes faded, replaced by desire. Evelyn tugged at his tie, her robe slipping off as they stumbled toward the bed.

Meanwhile, at the Sinclair estate...

As winter tightened its grip, Arabella had stopped her morning swims in the estate’s lake. But discipline was in her blood—she never slacked when it came to fitness.

Now, clad in a sleek pink workout set, Arabella pounded the treadmill, her face flushed, sweat glistening on her skin.

Sebastian stood nearby, towel and water bottle in hand, his tone gentle as he reported, "Miss Arabella, Chairman Adrian and Nathaniel have finalized their guest lists for the dinner. I’ve compared them—there’s a fifty percent overlap."

Arabella didn’t react. "Expected."

"I’m concerned."

Sebastian’s brow furrowed. "Isabella’s birthday is at The Grand Chateau, while Evelyn’s is at the Vanderbilt Hotel. Unintentionally, we’re clashing again."

"Let’s be clear—we didn’t choose this. Evelyn’s the one with no shame. She could’ve picked any other day, but no, she had to share it with Isabella. Is she not afraid of karma?" Despite her rapid pace, Arabella’s voice dripped with disdain.

"Evelyn is deliberately provoking us. But this party isn’t at Skyrim—it’s at Sinclair Estate. I’m worried..."

"That the guests will prioritize Nathaniel over us?"

"You’re as sharp as ever, Miss Arabella." Sebastian couldn’t resist the compliment.

"You’re such a romantic, aren’t you?"

Arabella stepped off the treadmill, drenched in sweat. Sebastian, ever the gentleman, moved to wipe her brow—but she snatched the towel from him.

"I’ve got it."

Sebastian’s jaw tightened, a pang of distance shooting through him. Since his confession, things had only grown colder between them. Was she pulling away even more?

"Adrian’s guest list includes the Chambers Group’s elite. I also sent an invitation to Lucas. He canceled his Vanderbilt plans immediately—confirmed he’ll be at Isabella’s party."

Arabella wiped her face, avoiding Sebastian’s gaze. "With the Chambers and Fairhaven families backing us, the fence-sitters will have no choice. The Vanderbilt-Chambers monopoly is ending. Once I’m President, power will shift. With Lucas’s support, no one will dare cross us."

Sebastian nodded. "It’s promising."

Arabella took a sip of water, still not looking at him.

"Miss Arabella," Sebastian hesitated, "have I... done something wrong lately? Is there anything I can improve?"

Arabella blinked. "No."

"There must be." His voice was strained, his handsome face flushing. "Just tell me. I’ll fix it."

"Sebastian, you didn’t do anything wrong. But you’re almost thirty. You should have your own life—a love life people envy."

"Miss Arabella—"

"My sister, Lillian, has always been close to you. I’ve seen the way you look at her."

Arabella’s eyes were sincere. "Why not give it a try? The Lockwoods are respected, and Adrian treats you like a son. There’d be no obstacles. It’d be perfect."

Sebastian’s heart pounded, but his voice was firm. "My care for Miss Lillian stems from her being your sister and Adrian’s daughter—my duty. I’ve watched her grow up. My feelings are purely brotherly."

Later that night, Alexander returned to Windermere after a grueling day.

Winter had come early to New York. Snow was forecast within days.

He’d suppressed his coughs the entire ride home, but the moment warm air hit him, the fit erupted violently.

"Mr. Alexander!"

Alva rushed over, horrified at how pale he was, his face flushed with fever. "You’re ill! Should I call the doctor?"

"Just hot water, Alva," Alexander rasped, unwilling to explain his injury.

"But sir, you look terrible!"

"It’s nothing. Just some medicine." He forced a smile.

"Mr. Alexander, Mr. Nathaniel wants you in the study," the butler announced.

In the study, Alexander barely suppressed a grimace.

Nathaniel and Evelyn were tangled on the sofa in matching robes. Evelyn’s makeup was smudged, her hair a mess as she littered kisses along Nathaniel’s jaw.

The sight made Alexander’s stomach turn.

"Alright, Alexander’s here," Nathaniel said, reluctantly pulling away.

"We’ll continue later," Evelyn purred, tracing his chest.

"You wanted to talk?" Alexander’s voice was flat.

"Your mother’s birthday is this weekend. How are the preparations?"

"My mother’s birthday?"

Alexander smirked coldly. "All these years, I’ve spent her birthdays at her grave. You never once celebrated her. Why the sudden interest?"

Nathaniel stiffened.

"If you mean Evelyn’s birthday, that’s not my responsibility. I haven’t lifted a finger."

Alexander’s smile vanished. "Evelyn is your wife and Lillian’s mother. The two of you can handle it. It’s not my place to interfere."

The word outsider ignited Nathaniel’s temper.

"Don’t you dare say you’re not a Vanderbilt! After everything the company’s given you—how dare you—"

A smug smirk played on Evelyn’s lips as she clung to Nathaniel.

"Are we done? If not, I’m going to bed."

Once, Alexander might’ve argued.

Now, he had no energy for this puppet and his manipulative wife.

"Alexander! I didn’t dismiss you!" Nathaniel shoved Evelyn aside, standing abruptly.

"Oh, one more thing."

Alexander paused at the door, his broad frame silhouetted against the light.

"I won’t be attending Evelyn’s party."

Evelyn’s face twisted in outrage.

"What do you mean?" Nathaniel demanded.

"You’re skipping your own family’s event? Going to the Sinclairs’ instead?"

"Yeah. Problem?"

"Really?"

"Is that so?"
###Chapter 280

The moment those words left his lips, Mr. and Mrs. Kingsley erupted in fury, their faces contorted with rage.

Isabella Sinclair glared at Alexander with venomous hatred, hiding behind Harrison like a vengeful shadow, her eyes sharp as daggers. "Alexander! Have you forgotten who you are?" Harrison's voice trembled with barely contained wrath.

"Spare me the lecture," Alexander replied coolly, his lips curling into a mocking smirk. "If not for your constant reminders, I might have actually forgotten."

"You ungrateful wretch!" Harrison roared, his vision blurring with anger. He jabbed a finger at Alexander's face. "I'm asking you one last time—are you really going to accept the Vanderbilt family's invitation this weekend?"

"Alexander, darling, why must you be so reckless?" Isabella interjected, adopting the tone of a concerned mother. "My birthday is insignificant. But you know full well the feud between your father and Nathaniel. And that Evangeline has been nothing but trouble for us. How can you, at such a critical moment, embolden our enemies while undermining your own family? As CEO, your absence would be a slap in your father's face!"

"Mrs. Sinclair." Alexander's voice was glacial. "If your birthday is truly unimportant, then perhaps it shouldn't be celebrated at all. You, your daughter, and your relatives have all abused your positions, dragging the company through scandal after scandal. Your reputation in Elmsworth is in ruins. If you insist on flaunting this shameless spectacle, do you take the public for fools? Or do you think the internet has no memory?"

Isabella's fists clenched, her entire body trembling as if struck by palsy.

Harrison's blind devotion to her wavered for the first time.

Then, mercilessly, Alexander delivered the final blow. "If Mr. Harrison wishes to play the doting husband, he shouldn’t expect the rest of this household to indulge your vanity or stomach your hypocrisy."

Isabella gasped, her vision swimming with rage.

"How dare you speak to your father like that!" Harrison bellowed, his composure shattered.

"Where is the butler?" he snapped, his voice echoing through the grand hall.

The butler scurried in, trembling.

Alexander remained unmoved, his expression one of cold disdain.

Harrison's fury burned hotter. "Bring the family whip. Now."

The butler paled. It had been nearly two decades since Alexander had last been punished.

The last time had been after his mother's death, when a young Alexander, consumed by grief and fury, had nearly attacked his own father. Harrison had beaten him unconscious with that very whip.

Now, history was repeating itself.

"Go!" Harrison barked.

The butler fled.

Isabella and her daughter, Victoria, exchanged smug glances.

Meanwhile, in her room, Seraphina—often dismissed as the "dimwit" of the family—heard the commotion.

"Seraphina!" Victoria burst in, grinning maliciously. "Come downstairs! Alexander's about to get what he deserves!"

Seraphina's heart clenched. "Why? What did he do?"

"Why? Because he's arrogant! He thinks he's untouchable just because he's CEO." Victoria sneered. "If it weren’t for Nathaniel's poor health, he'd be rotting in some branch office. He should be grateful Father even lets him stay in this house!"

Seraphina, though quiet, was far from stupid. She saw through Victoria's venom. "Alexander isn’t like that," she whispered. "You and Mother are the ones bullying him."

Victoria's face twisted. "You little—"

Just then, a maid rushed in. "Miss Seraphina, Miss Victoria—Mr. Harrison demands your presence downstairs immediately!"

Victoria stormed out, leaving Seraphina trembling.

The maid, Margaret, noticed the bruises on Seraphina's arms. "Miss, you must tell your father about this!"

Seraphina shook her head. "Please, just give me a moment."

Once alone, she dialed Evangeline's number with shaking hands.

The call connected instantly. "Seraphina? What's wrong?"

"Evangeline," Seraphina choked out. "Alexander's in trouble."

Evangeline scoffed. "Who would dare?"

"Father is going to whip him!"

Silence. Then—

"A whipping?" Evangeline's voice turned deadly.

Downstairs, the entire household had gathered.

Alexander stood alone, an unyielding figure amidst the sea of onlookers.

Harrison cracked the whip against the marble floor. The sound echoed like thunder.

"Kneel."

Alexander smirked. "Never."

"Then stand there and take it like the fool you are!" Harrison snarled.

The whip lashed out—once, twice, thrice.

Blood seeped through Alexander's shirt.

Isabella and Victoria watched with glee.

Alexander didn’t flinch.

"Will you admit your wrongdoing?" Harrison demanded.

"No."

"You insolent—"

"STOP!"

A voice cut through the hall like a blade.

Everyone turned.

Evangeline stood at the entrance, her presence commanding the room.

Alexander, pale and sweating, managed a faint smile as his vision blurred.

"Evangeline," he murmured, swaying slightly.

Then his knees buckled.

She caught him just in time.
###Chapter 281

Isabella saw Alexander staggering toward her, his body weakened. Without hesitation, she reached out, pulling him into her arms.

A warm, sticky wetness seeped into her palms.

Her pulse spiked.

Slowly, she lifted her hand.

Blood.

Her breath hitched as she took in the brutal lash marks marring Alexander’s back, his once pristine white shirt now soaked crimson.

Her pupils constricted, fury igniting in her chest, her gaze turning glacial.

"Alexander, are you okay?"

His handsome face glistened with sweat as he leaned into her embrace. "Do you care?"

"Of course I do!" she snapped, unable to rein in her emotions.

His heart swelled at her response. "Thank you, Isabella."

"Shut up!"

Her eyes blazed as she glared at him. "You’re injured. Don’t speak. I don’t want to hear another word from you."

He gave a wry smile, murmuring a soft "Okay" against her ear.

Isabella’s sudden appearance stunned everyone.

From the shadows, Seraphina watched her sister command the scene like a goddess descending from the heavens, tears of admiration welling in her eyes.

But Arabella and Genevieve weren’t pleased. Their expressions soured as if they’d swallowed something bitter.

"Mr. Reginald, your household is quite lively tonight," Isabella remarked, her tone laced with amusement. "Had I arrived any later, I might’ve missed the grand performance."

Her sharp gaze cut through the room like a blade, sending chills down spines.

The staff stifled their laughter.

With a serene smile, Isabella steadied Alexander. "They say not to air dirty laundry in public, but this is the first time I’ve seen a father punish his son so openly, with no regard for reputation. Why not strip him bare and hang him from the estate gates for three days? I’ll invite every reporter in New York to witness it—then your family’s fame will truly spread."

Her ruthless retort drew more stifled snickers.

Alexander shook his head in amusement. This woman—always finding ways to torment him.

Reginald despised her.

How had William raised such a disrespectful daughter?

"Ms. Isabella!"

Arabella, emboldened by her husband’s presence, lashed out. "The Kingsley family has upheld these traditions for generations. Those who err must accept punishment. My husband was raised this way, and so was Alexander. This is a Kingsley matter. You divorced him—you have no right to interfere!"

Isabella remained composed, having anticipated this.

But Alexander couldn’t tolerate Arabella’s attack. His eyes darkened, ready to retaliate—

"If she can’t interfere, can I?"

A commanding voice cut through the tension.

Everyone turned to see Nathaniel, who had arrived with Lawrence. Isabella’s presence had overshadowed him.

"Grandfather."

"Grandpa!"

Alexander and Isabella spoke in unison, her voice notably affectionate.

Arabella’s arrogance crumbled instantly, sweat beading on her forehead.

"Dad, when did you arrive?" Reginald asked, his grip on the whip trembling.

Nathaniel’s presence was formidable. "If I hadn’t come, my grandson might’ve been beaten to death by you!"

Seated in his wheelchair, he took in Alexander’s injuries, fury shaking his frame. "Alexander—are you alright?"

"I’m fine, Grandfather."

"Lawrence! Call my personal physician—now!"

Arabella, desperate to shift blame, interjected, "Reginald, Dad’s health is fragile. It’s late, and the air is cold. I’m worried—"

"Enough!" Nathaniel waved her off dismissively. "I’m in perfect health. Isabella takes excellent care of me. You act as if I’m on death’s door—are you cursing me?"

Arabella paled. "No, Dad, I didn’t mean—"

"And it wasn’t Isabella who brought me here."

Nathaniel didn’t let her finish. "She was visiting me when I heard about this disgrace. I rushed over immediately. She came only to ensure my safety. If you have questions, direct them to me—not her!"

All eyes turned to Arabella, her face ghostly white.

She had truly shot herself in the foot.

"Isabella, you went to see Grandfather?" Alexander’s gaze burned into her.

"Yes." She refused to meet his eyes.

"Why didn’t you ask me to come?"

"That’s my business. Why should I involve you?"

His heart ached at her sharp retort.

Genevieve frowned at Nathaniel’s words.

If Isabella’s presence was coincidental, who had summoned him?

Her gaze snapped to Seraphina—

The girl’s smug smile gave her away.

"Dad, Arabella’s right. You shouldn’t have come. It’s too taxing—"

Reginald stepped forward, but Nathaniel silenced him with a glare. "If you truly cared about my health, you wouldn’t have done this! You wouldn’t have enraged me! Damn it—you’ll be the death of me!"

The grand hall fell into deafening silence.
###Chapter 282

Isabella's bright eyes sparkled with mischief as she struggled to suppress a grin.

Nathaniel Kingsley momentarily forgot his pain, his entire focus locked on her radiant expression. A contented smile curved his lips despite the circumstances.

The room gasped collectively as Mr. Kingsley publicly berated Frederic Vanderbilt, heir to the Windermere Estate, without sparing an ounce of dignity.

Frederic Vanderbilt, humiliated before the elite of Elmsworth? Unthinkable!

Frederic's face burned crimson with fury. His jaw clenched as he barked, "Butler! Clear the room at once!"

"Absolutely not!" Mr. Kingsley's voice boomed with authority. "Tonight's matter will be settled here, in front of everyone. No one leaves!"

The old man's presence was formidable, his temper legendary—traits Isabella had clearly inherited.

"Father, what is the meaning of this?" Frederic snapped, irritation lacing his tone.

"Meaning?" Mr. Kingsley scoffed, tilting his head with disdain. "You disgrace Nathaniel in front of high society, yet dare question me? If you can shame him publicly, then I'll resolve this publicly!"

"Father! Must you always coddle this insolent son of mine?" Frederic's finger jabbed toward Nathaniel. "Your indulgence has made him arrogant beyond measure! Soon, he won't even acknowledge his own father!"

A cold, mirthless laugh escaped Nathaniel's lips.

The moment his mother had leapt from this very villa's rooftop, his so-called father had ceased to exist in his heart.

Isabella caught that hollow sound.

Her gaze lingered on Nathaniel's sharp profile, the hatred simmering in his eyes striking her like a blade. A pang of sorrow twisted in her chest.

"You claim Nathaniel is arrogant?" Mr. Kingsley leaned back, picking at his teeth with unsettling nonchalance. "Explain. How?"

The gathered elite exchanged glances—this old man truly had no filter.

"He defies me! Disobeys me!" Frederic spat, too enraged to think clearly. "I disciplined him according to family law! As his father, I have every right!"

"Ah, yes. Defiance." Mr. Kingsley's mocking gaze slid to Elspeth. "Frederic, you're the expert on that, aren't you? By your logic, I should've whipped you bloody when you dragged her into this family!"

The Abernathys' faces darkened.

"The Vanderbilt family law punishes those who deserve punishment." Mr. Kingsley slammed his palm on the armrest, making Elspeth flinch. "Tell me—what crime did Nathaniel commit?"

"He abandoned our family event to support the Sinclairs!" Frederic exploded.

Isabella's eyes widened. She turned to Nathaniel, stunned.

"For months, K Group has been undermining Vanderbilt Industries! Your precious granddaughter has been sabotaging us, costing over a billion in market value! This weekend's gala was critical—a chance to rally Elmsworth's elite. Yet as CEO, he chose to stand with our rivals!" Frederic's voice shook with rage. "Tell me, Father—how could I not punish such betrayal?"

Isabella's pulse quickened. She stared at Nathaniel, her thoughts in turmoil.

"Oh? You mean Elspeth's birthday gala?" Mr. Kingsley arched a brow.

"Yes! It's more than a party—it's a strategic opportunity!"

"Well, if Nathaniel isn't attending, neither am I."

"What?!"

"Not only that, I'll be joining Isabella at Emeric Sinclair's birthday celebration for his wife, Myra." Mr. Kingsley grinned. "Problem? Will you whip me too?"

"Grandfather..." Isabella was speechless. His blatant favoritism was almost touching.

"Father! You're doing this deliberately!" Frederic hurled the whip to the ground.

"Of course I am." Mr. Kingsley's expression hardened. "Your wife's reputation is in tatters, yet you throw her a lavish gala? If you've no shame, I still have mine to protect!"

The crowd's scornful glances toward Elspeth were unmistakable.

Elspeth's neck flushed scarlet. She seethed internally—Why won't this old bastard just die? Once he's gone, we'll see who protects Nathaniel and that Sinclair wench!

"Regardless, Nathaniel and I aren't attending. Deal with it." Mr. Kingsley turned to the couple, his voice softening. "Isabella, Nathaniel—you're coming home with me tonight."

Their eyes met. A silent understanding passed between them before they nodded.

Just then, Mr. Murray rushed in with a physician.

"Mr. Frederic, the doctor has arrived."

"Good. He can tend to Nathaniel at my estate." Mr. Kingsley rose. "I refuse to stay in this wretched place another minute!"

With his grandchildren in tow, he strode past Frederic without a backward glance.

"Oh, and one more thing—starting today, the Vanderbilt family's archaic laws are abolished!" He shot Frederic a derisive look. "We're in the 21st century, yet you cling to medieval traditions? Pathetic."

The room erupted in stifled laughter.

Frederic's face purpled with rage.

The group departed for Kingsley Manor, leaving chaos in their wake.
###Chapter 283

Hamilton held onto Thaddeus with one hand and Evadne with the other, refusing to let go.

His grip was firm, his words relentless. He criticized Frederic, then Elspeth, his complaints never repeating. Evadne worried he’d exhaust himself.

After venting, Hamilton turned affectionate, murmuring Thaddeus’ name and casually pressing their hands together. Thaddeus couldn’t help but smile at Evadne, warmth in his gaze.

Evadne felt it but ignored him, lips pressed tight.

Seeing her indifference, Thaddeus tightened his hold.

Then—her hand slipped free.

He looked up, meeting her irritated glare.

She shot him a look sharp enough to flay skin.

Fine. He’d failed.

But her presence tonight was enough. He wouldn’t push.

"Thaddeus, you should thank Evadne," Hamilton said pointedly, winking. "If she hadn’t told me about Frederic’s punishment, I wouldn’t have gotten here in time. She saved you."

"Evadne," Thaddeus murmured, voice soft, eyes tender. "Thank you."

His gaze sent a shiver down her spine. She scoffed. "Thank Mari, not me."

"Mari?" Both men blinked.

"She called me. Told me everything. That’s how I knew to contact your grandfather." Evadne’s tone turned icy. "Don’t read into it."

"You told Grandpa. That means you care." Thaddeus was relentless.

Evadne rolled her eyes. "Believe what you want."

Hamilton sighed. "Mari’s a good girl. Kind-hearted, unlike that spoiled Glynnis. Almost landed herself in jail—nearly gave me gray hair!"

"Mari was always kind to me," Evadne said, voice steady despite the ache in her chest. "Without her, I wouldn’t have lasted three years in that house."

Hamilton caught the unspoken pain. He shot Thaddeus a reproachful look.

Thaddeus’ chest tightened with regret.

"Grandpa," Evadne hesitated. "There’s something I’d like to ask."

"Go ahead."

"I want you to take Mari in."

"I agree," Thaddeus cut in.

"I wasn’t asking you!"

He smirked. "Doesn’t matter. I support you either way."

Evadne gritted her teeth. She wanted to leap out of the car.

"Did something happen to Mari?" Hamilton asked, concerned.

"She has autism. Frederic and Elspeth are too busy to care for her properly. It’s not good for her condition." Evadne kept her tone neutral, avoiding mention of Glynnis’ cruelty. "With you, she’ll have family. And you won’t be alone."

Hamilton’s eyes misted. "You’re too thoughtful. I’ve neglected her." He patted her hand. "Tomorrow, I’ll send for her."

Meanwhile, Windermere Estate simmered with tension.

Frederic’s attempt at discipline had backfired spectacularly. Humiliated, he’d stormed out.

Elspeth fumed in her room, hatred boiling in her veins.

A timid knock interrupted her seething.

"Ma’am? Miss Glynnis is hitting Miss Mari again. Should we intervene?"
###Chapter 284

The chaos of one storm had barely settled when another tempest was brewing.

With Alexander Kingsley and Sebastian Lockwood both absent from the estate, the old adage proved true - when the lions are away, the jackals will play.

Isabella Sinclair was certain her younger sister Arabella had betrayed them to their grandfather. In a fury, she stormed into Arabella's chambers, seizing her by the hair and dragging her mercilessly to the grand parlor. She'd learned well from watching her father humiliate Sebastian earlier, and now she put those lessons to brutal use. "Isabella, stop! You're hurting me!" Arabella's tears fell freely as she felt strands of hair being torn from her scalp.

"Traitor! You deserve every ounce of pain!" Isabella spat venomously. "As your elder sister, it's my duty to discipline you for your betrayal!"

With those words, Isabella raised her hand and delivered a stinging slap across Arabella's face.

The sharp crack echoed through the room, startling the household staff.

They watched in horror as delicate Arabella crumpled to the floor like a broken doll.

The servants' eyes burned with silent fury, but as employees of the Sinclair estate, they dared not interfere in family matters. Their outrage remained bottled behind clenched teeth.

"Isabella, please! I'm sorry! I won't do it again!" Arabella covered her stinging cheek, sobs wracking her slender frame.

She knew no help would come.

She wanted to fight back, but her body felt leaden, utterly powerless.

Isabella was the golden child - their grandfather's favorite, their parents' darling. What hope did she have against such privilege?

While others could walk away, Arabella had no choice but to remain in this gilded cage. Endurance was her only survival strategy.

"Miss Arabella! Oh, Miss Arabella!"

Margaret Laurent came running, tears streaming down her face as she knelt beside Arabella, cradling her protectively. "Miss Isabella! How dare you treat your own sister this way?"

Isabella threw back her head and laughed, one hand planted on her hip, her gaze dripping with contempt. "Well, well. Seems the little mouse has found herself an ally."

"Margaret, don't! Just go!" Arabella pleaded, covering Margaret's mouth in panic. She knew her sister's cruelty knew no bounds.

"I won't leave you!" Margaret clung to Arabella fiercely, her tear-filled eyes blazing with defiance. "Even if it costs me my position, even if I'm banished from New York, I won't abandon you! Miss Isabella, what you've done is criminal! No one has the right to strike another person!"

"You insignificant worm! How dare you speak to me like that?" Isabella's laughter turned vicious as she strode forward and kicked Margaret squarely in the shoulder, sending the maid sprawling. "I hit her, so what? Go cry to the police if you dare!"

Margaret gasped as pain radiated through her shoulder, certain the bone had fractured.

The other servants seethed with impotent rage, some stepping forward only to be restrained by colleagues.

They all knew the Sinclair family's influence in New York. One wrong move could cost them not just their jobs, but their livelihoods in the city.

"Isabella!" Arabella's voice cracked like a whip.

She could endure abuse directed at herself, but seeing Margaret hurt awakened something primal within her. Her normally gentle eyes burned crimson with fury.

"What? You dare address me so informally?" Isabella recoiled slightly at her sister's unprecedented show of spine.

"Apologize to Margaret! Now!" Arabella rose unsteadily to her feet, her slight frame trembling with barely contained rage, her gaze sharp enough to draw blood.

The transformation was shocking.

"Apologize? Have you lost your mind?" Isabella scoffed.

But before she could continue, Arabella charged at her with a guttural cry, slamming into her with surprising force.

The impact sent Isabella stumbling backward before landing unceremoniously on her backside, legs flailing ridiculously in the air.

A few stifled giggles escaped the watching staff.

"Arabella!" Isabella screeched, her face purpling with humiliation and rage. She scrambled up, looking ready to commit murder. "Restrain her! Now!"

At her command, two burly maids rushed forward and pinned Arabella's arms behind her back.

"Let me go!" Arabella thrashed violently, but her delicate frame was no match for their strength.

"You wretched little bitch! No one can save you now!" Isabella's eyes glittered with malice as she rolled up her sleeves and advanced, delivering another brutal slap to Arabella's left cheek.

Arabella's vision whited out from the pain, a low moan escaping her lips as cold sweat drenched her nightgown.

Isabella smirked in satisfaction, finally venting her pent-up fury on her sister's fragile form.

"One red cheek looks uneven. Let me balance it out!" She raised her hand again.

"Touch her again and I'll break every bone in your hand."

The icy voice cut through the room like a blade.

All heads snapped toward the doorway in shock.

Isabella froze, her blood turning to ice at that terrifyingly familiar voice.

She tried to lower her raised hand, but it was too late.

Alexander Kingsley stood framed in the doorway, his towering presence radiating lethal menace.

Isabella's ferocious expression melted into docile obedience in an instant.

Through tear-blurred vision, Arabella watched as Alexander strode toward her without sparing a glance for anyone else.

All her strength left her in a rush, as if she'd been pulled from drowning depths. A soft sigh escaped her lips.

"Alexander."

That fragile whisper seemed to ignite something feral in Alexander's eyes.

For a heartbeat, his breath caught, his chest constricting with unbearable pain.
###Chapter 285

"Release her."

Alexander's gaze burned through the two maids restraining Isabella, his voice dripping with venom. It was the kind of tone that made spines stiffen and blood run cold.

The servants trembled, their eyes darting to Victoria for guidance.

Victoria's lips curled in disgust. Alexander was commanding her staff—defending this worthless girl!

She had been ready to back down. After all, Alexander was the man she had dreamed of for years. How could she defy him?

But then she remembered.

Her mother had already severed ties with the Kingsley family. There was no hope for her now.

And this was her home. The Vanderbilt estate.

Did Alexander really think he could waltz in here and dictate terms?

Rage boiled in her veins.

"No!" she snapped. "This is my house. My servants answer to me!"

A sharp cry cut through the air.

Alexander moved like lightning. One of the maids holding Isabella was sent flying, crashing into the wall with a sickening thud.

Victoria's breath hitched.

The second maid released Isabella instantly, dropping to her knees. "Mr. Kingsley, please—we were only following orders—"

Another kick. Another scream.

Victoria stumbled back, her face draining of color.

She had always dismissed the rumors about Alexander—the whispers of him being ruthless, merciless.

Now she understood.

The room was deathly silent.

"Alexander..." Isabella's voice was fragile, her legs shaking as she leaned into him.

His arm wrapped around her waist, pulling her close. His fingers traced soothing circles along her trembling back.

"It's alright, Isabella. I'm here."

Victoria's nails dug into her palms, jealousy twisting her stomach into knots.

"It hurts..." Isabella whimpered.

"Where?" His voice was tight with worry.

"It hurts..." she repeated, as if lost in a haze.

At the top of the grand staircase, Eleanor stood frozen.

She had been descending when she saw the scene unfold—Alexander squaring off against Victoria, Isabella cradled protectively in his arms.

Eleanor's eyes narrowed.

Then, without a word, she retreated into the shadows.

"Victoria."

Alexander's voice was a blade. His gaze locked onto her, cold and lethal. "You just got out of prison. Are you eager to go back?"

Victoria flinched.

"Let me make this clear—one last time." His voice dropped to a growl. "Isabella is mine. Anyone who touches her answers to me—and to the Kingsley family."

The words hung in the air, absolute.

Victoria's knees nearly buckled.

Her father wasn't here to shield her. Neither was her mother.

"The only reason you're still standing is because you haven't crossed my line. But mark my words, Victoria—if you ever lay a finger on Isabella again, I'll bury you in a cell so deep, not even your father will be able to dig you out."

His grip on Isabella tightened. "And when that happens, I won't care about decades of friendship between our families."

His eyes flicked upward, catching Eleanor's retreating figure.

Eleanor froze.

But then she straightened. She was the lady of this house. Alexander's elder. What did she have to fear?

Victoria was left speechless.

Humiliation burned through her. The servants' pitying glances were salt in the wound.

"Isabella, let's go." Alexander's voice softened as he pressed his lips to her temple. "I'll take you to see Sebastian. Or your sister in law. Whatever you want."

Isabella nodded weakly.

Alexander lifted her into his arms, ignoring the stunned onlookers as he strode toward the exit.

"Alexander!" Victoria shrieked. "You can't just take her! She's a Vanderbilt! Have you asked my parents?"

She couldn't bear the thought of Isabella leaving with him. The jealousy would eat her alive.

"I'm taking Isabella. She wants to go. What's the problem?" Alexander smirked. "And do I really need your mother's permission? If she objected, wouldn't she have stopped me by now?"

Victoria's mouth opened—then closed.

Before she could retort, Alexander was gone.

The cold wind outside bit at their skin, but Alexander held Isabella closer, shielding her.

He wasn't a gentle man by nature. But for her, he'd learned tenderness.

His large hand rubbed warmth into her arm, desperate to chase away the chill.

Isabella nestled against his chest, her breathing steadying.

Alexander's throat tightened.

He loved this. Loved being her shelter.

Olivia, waiting by the car, smiled knowingly and opened the door.

Just as Alexander moved to help Isabella inside, a thin figure stumbled forward.

Linda.

"Mr. Kingsley! Please—wait!"

Olivia stepped forward, ready to intercept, but Linda dropped to her knees before she could react.

"Mr. Kingsley... please help Miss Isabella. Please." Tears streaked down her face.

"Olivia, help her up." Alexander frowned. "Speak."

Linda shook her head, refusing to rise. "I won't get up until you promise to help her! I'm just a maid—but I'd give my life for Miss Isabella!"

"What happened?"

Linda wiped her tears, then carefully rolled up Isabella's sleeve.

Alexander's breath caught.

Bruises. Old and new.

His vision turned red.

"Who. Did. This."

Three words. That was all he managed.

Olivia shuddered.

She knew Alexander better than anyone. When his voice went this quiet, this controlled—he was beyond furious.

"It was Miss Victoria," Linda sobbed. "She tortures Miss Isabella whenever Mr. Sebastian isn't home! He tries to protect her, but he can't be here all the time!"

Alexander's jaw clenched.

Olivia's fists tightened.

"Mr. Kingsley... you're Mr. Sebastian's closest friend. And you care for her. Please—protect her."

Alexander exhaled sharply, looking down at the fragile girl in his arms.

"I promise."

His voice was steel. "As long as I'm alive, no one will hurt Isabella again."

And with that, he carried her away—right under Victoria's nose.

The humiliation was unbearable.

Why did that idiot have a protector?

Why not her?

She was prettier. Smarter. More talented.

Yet Alexander would rather waste his affection on a broken girl than glance her way?

Rage consumed her.

She turned on Linda, punishing her by making her scrub every toilet in the estate—and docking her entire year's bonus.

"That's enough!" Eleanor's voice cut through the room. She lounged on the sofa, filing her nails. "You look more vicious than that little witch Evelyn. No wonder Alexander wants nothing to do with you."

Victoria froze.

Something was off.

Her mother always took her side. Always defended her.

So why was she sitting back now?

"Mother!" Victoria's voice cracked. "You saw what happened downstairs! Why didn't you help me?"

Eleanor scoffed. "Why should I?"

Victoria's world tilted.

"Even I've given up on Alexander. Yet here you are—still pining like a fool." Eleanor shook her head. "I won't waste my efforts on a lost cause. If Alexander wants Isabella, then so be it. She is my daughter too. And if marrying her secures the Kingsley alliance, who am I to object?"

Victoria's vision blurred.

Her mother—supporting Isabella?

What was she, then?

A discarded pawn?

"Isabella can't have Alexander! I won't allow it!" Victoria screamed, her body shaking violently.

Eleanor's eyes darkened.

She picked up her wine glass and flung it at Victoria.

Red wine splashed across her face, dripping onto her dress.

Victoria stood stunned.

"Who taught you to raise your voice at me?" Eleanor hissed. "If you're so desperate for Alexander, go win him. But let me save you the trouble—he'd rather die than look at you twice."

With that, she stormed out.

Victoria collapsed.

Her mother's words shattered the last of her pride.

Her fingers closed around a shard of broken glass. Blood welled, but she didn't feel the pain.

In her mind, it wasn't glass she was clutching—but Isabella's throat.

"If everyone else has to die for Alexander to be mine... then let them die."
###Chapter 286

Alexander cradled Isabella in his arms as he stepped into the sleek black car. Olivia, ever the reliable driver, maneuvered the luxury vehicle away from the Windsor Estates with practiced ease.

Inside, Alexander held Isabella close, his fingers tracing through her soft hair. His chest ached with a pain so sharp it stole his breath.

He had planned to meet Nathaniel for drinks tonight. But the moment he walked through the door, the scene that greeted him shattered his composure.

The words Margaret had spoken—the cruel, cutting accusations—played over in his mind. The sight of those scars on Isabella's arms, fresh and angry, sent a wave of icy fury through his veins. It was as if his blood had turned to shards of glass, slicing through him with every heartbeat.

This pain was different.

When he had lost Seraphina, it had hurt. But that was a dull, distant ache compared to this.

He exhaled sharply, resting his jaw against the top of Isabella's head, his burning eyes closing briefly.

I promised you, Isabella. I swore I'd protect you.

And Alexander Kingsley never broke his promises.

"Mr. Kingsley," Olivia's voice was quiet but firm as she glanced at him through the rearview mirror. "Where to next?"

Alexander hesitated.

Yes, he had declared in front of Gabrielle that he was taking Isabella away. But that didn’t mean he could just bring her back to his penthouse like this.

If Nathaniel found out, he’d skin him alive.

"Isabella," he murmured, brushing his thumb over her cheek. "I can take you to see Nathaniel. Or maybe your sister—Lillian. You could stay with her tonight. How does that sound?"

No response.

Her brow was pinched in pain, her fingers pressed tightly against her left ear.

"Isabella? Isabella?"

He called her name again, but she didn’t react.

"All I hear is... pain," she whispered.

"Where does it hurt?"

Slowly, she lifted her gaze to his. The imprint of Gabrielle’s slap still marked her cheek, her tear-filled eyes wide and heartbreakingly beautiful.

"Alexander," she said softly. "I’m sorry. I know you’re speaking to me, but I can’t hear you."

"You can’t hear me?" His pulse spiked. "Why not?"

She uncurled her fingers from her ear—revealing a smear of blood on her palm.

Alexander’s blood ran cold.

"Olivia," he snapped. "Hospital. Now."

Back at The Regal Palace, in one of the private suites, Nathaniel lay on the bed, surrounded by Reginald, Mr. Lockwood, a private physician, and Seraphina. Dominic, who had just finished his shift, had rushed over the moment he heard. He was still in his sleepwear, slippers on despite the winter chill.

The room was thick with tension.

Finally, Seraphina broke the silence. "Well? Take off your shirt."

"In front of everyone?" Nathaniel arched a brow.

"What are you afraid of?" she shot back, her sharp gaze unflinching. "Unless you’ve got something to hide?"

Dominic snorted.

Nathaniel’s lips twitched. "It’s not that. I just don’t think this requires an audience. A little medicine, and you by my side—that’s more than enough."

Seraphina’s fingers curled into fists. If there was a school for shamelessness, Nathaniel would be its founder.

"Right," Reginald interjected smoothly. "We’re just crowding him. Dr. Lockwood and Seraphina can handle this. The rest of us should step out."

Nathaniel smirked. "Exactly. Dr. Lockwood, you can leave the supplies. I only need Seraphina."

The knowing glances exchanged around the room made Seraphina’s blood boil.

When they were finally alone, the air between them was heavy.

"Take it off," she ordered.

Nathaniel obeyed, wincing as he tried to peel the blood-soaked fabric from his wounds.

A performance.

This pain was nothing compared to what he’d endured in the field. But if a little theatrics earned him even a shred of her concern, he’d play the part.

"Stop." Seraphina reached out, her fingers brushing his. "Let me."

Nathaniel immediately covered her hand with his, warmth seeping into her skin.

"As you wish."

She pulled away sharply. "Why do you listen to me? We’re not—"

"Lie down."

He complied, stretching out on the bed.

The sight of his torn shirt, the wounds beneath crusted with blood, made her stomach twist. Her vision blurred.

"Does it scare you?" he asked quietly, watching her.

"It’s fine. Stay still."

She grabbed the scissors from the bedside table, carefully cutting away the ruined fabric. Nathaniel’s gaze darkened as he studied her—the way her hands moved with precision, the way her lips pressed into a thin line.

"Seraphina," he murmured.

She ignored him, applying antiseptic with more force than necessary.

He hissed but didn’t pull away. "You remind me of someone."

"Who?"

"I don’t know."

"How can you not know?"

"Because I truly don’t remember."

His eyes drifted to the window, lost in memory. A figure from his time in the peacekeeping forces—stubborn, relentless.

Seraphina’s pulse hammered in her throat.

Luckily, he couldn’t see her face.

"We were given an impossible mission," he continued. "Extract hostages from a Zenithia stronghold and escort them to the Windhelm Embassy. A hundred men against an army. A suicide run."

He laughed bitterly. "If it wasn’t for Paloma—if she hadn’t dragged me back to camp, if she hadn’t forced me to keep fighting—I wouldn’t be here."

"Paloma?" Her voice wavered.

"Yes. I never learned her real name. She wore a white coat, a mask covering most of her face. Only her eyes were visible."

Seraphina liked the name.

"When I woke up, she was gone. Vanished."

Nathaniel exhaled. "I’ve searched for her ever since. But no matter what connections I used, no trace."

Her hands trembled as she smoothed ointment over his wounds.

He remembered.

"Just now, when you were tending to me," he said softly, "it felt familiar. Like her."

"Sounds like you’ve had plenty of women on your mind over the years," she forced out, teasing. "Weren’t you still with Cassandra back then?"

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened.

"Military life must’ve been lonely. I’m sure you found ways to cope."

"Seraphina." A warning.

"Maybe if you’d found this Paloma sooner, you could’ve had a little wartime romance."

"Don’t mock her." His voice turned sharp. "I owe her my life. My feelings for her are nothing but respect. You can insult me all you want—but not her."
###Chapter 287

Evadne's crimson lips parted slightly, her heart hammering against her ribs.

She had assumed the battlefield horrors they'd endured together, the way they'd clung to each other for survival, had left an imprint only on her. But Thaddeus? He hadn't forgotten either. And he'd never stopped chasing her.

With his power, any other woman would've been found in days.

Yet the "Paloma" he'd been desperately hunting was none other than her—the Ashbourne heiress, his ex-wife.

After leaving Zenithia, Evadne had erased every trace of herself, especially while dodging her father's surveillance. Volunteering with Doctors Without Borders? A fake identity. A pseudonym.

Her cunning had made her impossible to track, even for a man like Thaddeus.

"Evadne?" His voice softened when she stayed silent. "Did I upset you? I just—I needed you to know. Paloma saved my life. I never had ulterior motives."

Her almond eyes darkened. A cold smile curled her lips. "Right. Because back then, you were too busy being obsessed with Acacia. Arguing with your grandfather for her. Losing sleep over her. How could you spare a glance for anyone else? Even the woman who saved your life wasn't a woman to you, was she?"

Every word was a needle. Every phrase struck a nerve.

Thaddeus couldn't take it. He sat up abruptly, startling her.

Their gazes locked. His burned into hers.

Her breath hitched. The cotton wool slipped from her fingers as he seized her hand, squeezing until her knuckles whitened.

"Thaddeus! That hurts!"

"I've made mistakes." His voice was rough, eyes shadowed with pain. "I regret them. I'm trying to make amends. I know forgiveness won't come easy. So I'll chase you forever—until my heart stops."

A bitter laugh escaped her. "Forever? How many women have heard that from you? You must've whispered the same sweet nothings to Acacia. Made the same grand vows. Didn't you swear to my face that she was the only woman you'd ever marry? And yet—"

Her voice cracked. Tears welled but didn't fall.

Thaddeus had carved wounds too deep to heal.

Even now, with his life-saving act, his apparent remorse—the ghost of Acacia haunted her. The memory of his devotion to that woman was a knife twisting in her chest.

His jaw clenched as she pried his hand away. Each finger felt like it was being ripped off.

"Once, I was your wife. Legally. But you were never mine. Now you come back with pretty words? You think I care? Chase me all you want. Just stop talking about it."

Her voice broke on the last word.

"Alright." He swallowed hard. "I won't say another word."

Then he did something unimaginable.

He knelt before her. Took her hand. Pressed a searing kiss to her knuckles.

Evadne's pulse skyrocketed. Heat flooded her cheeks.

"Forgive me, Ms. Evadne." His voice was velvet, eyes pleading. "I talk too much. I'm too nosy. Just...forgive me this once?"

Her breath caught.

This wasn't the ruthless tycoon of Elmsworth. Not the unshakable CEO.

This man was...humbled. Desperate.

And it sent a thrill through her.

She cleared her throat, refusing to acknowledge the forgiveness he sought. But her anger had dulled.

"What were you thinking tonight?" She jabbed his forehead. "Letting your father beat you like some helpless child? You're thirty years old. Fight back!"

His lips curved. "Do you...care?"

"It's my Hippocratic Oath. You're my patient." She lifted her chin.

His smile widened. "So you do care."

He looked at her like she was the sun. "One beating for a single word of concern? Worth it."

Evadne scoffed. "You're insane. Maybe I should check you for brain damage."

Meanwhile, Jareth was breaking every speed limit to reach the hospital, Mari cradled in his arms.

From the moment they'd left the car, he hadn't let her go. His eyes were wild, jaw clenched.

Lily trailed behind, watching the usually unflappable man unravel.

Mari was special. She'd thawed his icy heart.

"Mr. Jareth," a nurse stammered, "our top specialists are off-duty—"

"Get me a doctor. Now." His voice was lethal. "Or I'll turn this place into my next nightclub."

The nurse fled.

Jareth's grip tightened around Mari. Sweat soaked through her gown.

"Mari?" He brushed her hair back. "Does it still hurt?"

She didn't answer. Just winced, tears streaking her cheeks.

Each one felt like a blade to his chest.

"Mr. Jareth," Lily murmured, "her hearing was damaged by Glynnis's slap. She can't hear you."

Rage ignited in his veins. He wanted to rip Glynnis apart.

"If Mari loses her hearing," he growled, "I'll gouge out Glynnis's eyes and shove them into her ears."

Then he pressed a kiss to Mari's damp forehead.

Ten minutes later, a terrified medical team examined Mari.

"Ruptured eardrum," the doctor explained. "From trauma. Some cases lead to permanent tinnitus."

Jareth's blood ran cold.

"But Mari's damage is minimal," the doctor added hastily. "With surgery and rest, full recovery is likely."

"Likely?" Jareth's voice dropped.

"Certain!" The doctor paled. "Absolutely certain!"

Jareth turned to Mari. His voice gentled. "You'll be fine. I promise."

But Mari shook her head violently. "No surgery! I hate hospitals!"

Lily noted her terror. Something in her past had left scars.

Jareth knelt before her. Took her hands. "Mari. If you don't do this, you'll never hear me again. Never hear your brother. Please. For me?"

Her resistance wavered.

Finally, with a shaky breath, she nodded.
###Chapter 288

Evadne had just finished giving Thaddeus his medicine when Mr. Murray entered the room.

"How are you feeling, Thaddeus?"

"Much better, thanks to Evadne." Thaddeus' gaze lingered on her, warm and appreciative.

Evadne subtly took a step back, putting distance between them.

Normally, Thaddeus was as emotionally distant as a monk in meditation. But now? He was all charm and flirtation, seizing every chance to send her heart racing with just a look.

It was like he was a seasoned pan, and she was a fresh egg—he had her sizzling before she even realized it.

"Evadne, I can't thank you enough."

Mr. Murray started to bow, but Evadne quickly stepped forward, gently stopping him.

"Mr. Murray, there's no need. It's my duty."

"Evadne, you're still so kind to Mr. Thaddeus." Mr. Murray wasn't usually one to interfere, but he couldn't resist playing matchmaker.

"Don't misunderstand. My concern for Thaddeus is purely because he matters to his grandfather."

Evadne smiled. "Everything I do is for Grandpa."

Mr. Murray could only offer an awkward smile in return.

Thaddeus, however, looked utterly smitten, grinning like a fool.

He knew her sharp tongue well, but he also knew that at least one part of her—whether her body or her lips—was always honest with him.

"Thaddeus, if you're feeling up to it, Frederic would like to speak with you in the study."

Thaddeus gave a slight nod. "Of course."

Then he turned to Evadne, his voice dropping to a whisper. "Wait for me. I won't be long."

"Humph. Who said I'm waiting for you? I'm leaving now. Goodbye!"

Evadne brushed past him, chin lifted defiantly.

He had the sudden urge to grab her hand and pull her back. But all he could do was watch her walk away, lips pressed together in silent frustration.

Seeing Thaddeus' expression, Mr. Murray felt both amused and regretful.

"Do I look ridiculous to you, Mr. Murray?" Thaddeus asked, his tone self-deprecating.

Mr. Murray smiled reassuringly. "Not at all, Thaddeus. I'm glad you've finally acknowledged your feelings. You're both free now. There's still a chance. Just love her the way she once loved you. She's a good woman. Don't let her down again."

Then Mr. Murray bowed deeply.

Thaddeus swallowed hard, fighting back the lump in his throat. "Mr. Murray... do you really think I can win her back?"

Mr. Murray hesitated before answering. "The road won't be easy, Thaddeus. But no matter what, don't give up on her."

Thaddeus walked alone into Hamilton's study.

As soon as the door closed behind him, Evadne's slender figure emerged from around the staircase. She tiptoed to the study door, pressing her ear against it, her dark eyes gleaming with curiosity.

Inside, Hamilton poured his grandson a glass of warm water.

"Thank you, Grandfather."

Thaddeus accepted it with both hands, maintaining his composure despite his injuries.

"Thaddeus, are your wounds still painful?" Hamilton's face was etched with concern.

"They're nothing serious. Just superficial."

Thaddeus shifted slightly, discomfort flickering across his face before he masked it. "Don't worry. I'm not that fragile. I am a soldier, after all."

"If you're not fragile, then why didn't you fight back? Your father was clearly provoked by Elspeth. He had no right to take it out on you. Why didn't you throw that whip back in her face?" Hamilton's voice was thick with frustration.

Thaddeus stared at his reflection in the glass, silent.

After a long pause, Hamilton sighed. "You're my grandson, Thaddeus. You're part of this family. You don't still feel guilty toward the Abernathys, do you?"

Thaddeus' jaw tightened.

When he was five, he and his dying mother had lived in a filthy slum, bullied and struggling to survive.

Then, one stormy night, a luxury car had crashed into their bleak world.

Their ramshackle house leaked everywhere. The rickety wooden door was easily pushed open by the man outside.

A young Thaddeus had been sitting by his mother's bed, feeding her water. His father, Frederic, had been young and handsome then, dressed in an immaculate suit. He strode into the room, his expensive shoes untouched by the storm.

At that moment, Thaddeus had looked at this man who seemed to have descended from heaven, and only one thought had crossed his mind.

Please save my mother.

Frederic had rushed to the bedside, tears in his eyes as he gathered the unconscious woman into his arms.

"Cynthia... I'm sorry. I came too late. I've come for you and our son."

Thaddeus would never forget the day Frederic brought them to the Abernathy estate, their love as deep as the ocean. Despite the family's objections, Frederic had accepted him—his illegitimate child.

But had Frederic truly loved his mother?

If he had, he wouldn't have turned his affections elsewhere. And his mother wouldn't have sunk into despair and taken her own life.

Was her death due to illness, or the fickleness of the man she loved?

"You don't owe the Abernathys anything, boy. They owe you," Hamilton said, patting his grandson's shoulder.

"Your father loved your mother deeply. But at the time, the Abernathy Group was in crisis. We had to arrange his marriage to the Austins to save the company. I'm sorry, my boy."

"You did nothing wrong, Grandfather. You did what was necessary." Thaddeus' words implied forgiveness—but not for Frederic.

"I didn't fight back because of my brother. Before he left Elmsworth for treatment, he asked me to maintain peace with Frederic for his sake." Thaddeus' voice was steady. "I've tolerated it as long as I could. But this is the last time."

Hamilton sighed heavily.

Outside the door, Evadne strained to listen.

She was practically glued to the wood, trying to catch every word. The mansion's soundproofing was excellent, and she had to focus hard to hear clearly.

Thaddeus' brother? What happened back then?

Suddenly, the study door swung open!

Lost in thought, Evadne didn't react in time—and collided with Thaddeus.

"Eavesdropping?"

"Goodbye!" Evadne tried to bolt, but Thaddeus caught her waist, pulling her flush against him.

Their bodies pressed together, warmth seeping through their clothes. Their heartbeats were loud, synchronized.

Caught red-handed, Evadne flushed crimson, squirming in his hold. Thaddeus' grip tightened, his fingers curling around the delicate curve of her waist.

"Answer me."

"I—I came to say goodbye to Grandfather! I wasn't trying to listen in. Let go of me!"

Thaddeus studied her—the blush on her cheeks, the way she fumbled for excuses. It was endearing.

He couldn't look away. The more he saw, the deeper he fell.

"No secrets," he murmured.

"Huh?"

"I have no secrets from you."

He leaned in, his breath brushing her lips, barely restraining himself from kissing her. "Ask me anything. I'll tell you everything."

"Fine. Then tell me—what happened between you and your brother?"

Thaddeus' expression darkened.

"Men's mouths are full of lies," Evadne scoffed. "Your promises are just hot air, aren't they?"

"Once things settle, I'll tell you everything. You're tired. Go home and rest."

Before she could react, he pressed a feather-light kiss to her forehead—gentle, restrained.

Her breath hitched, heart fluttering wildly.

"Goodnight, Evadne."

Outside the grand Havenbrook Villa, the night had turned bitingly cold.

Evadne had left in such a hurry that Jason, worried she'd catch a chill, had brought a thick down jacket when he came to pick her up.

He'd waited so long his feet had gone numb before she finally emerged.

"Miss Evadne!"

She didn't respond, walking past him with flushed cheeks and a distant look in her eyes.

"Miss Evadne!" Jason caught her arm, concerned. "Are you all right?"

Evadne blinked. "Oh. Yes, I'm fine. Thank you for picking me up. Let's go."

Inside the car, the heater was already blasting. A thermos of tea Jason had prepared sat waiting for her.

Evadne crossed her legs, sipping the tea, her fingers absently brushing her forehead where Thaddeus had kissed her.

The warmth of his lips still lingered.

"Jason, can you look into something for me tomorrow?"

"Of course. What do you need?"

"Find out everything about Thaddeus' relationship with his brother—and what really happened to the Abernathy family before his mother left Elmsworth."

She didn't trust Thaddeus to tell her the truth.

But she would uncover it—no matter what.
###Chapter 289

The ear reconstruction surgery, typically requiring weeks of waiting, was fast-tracked when the hospital administrators caught wind that Nathaniel Kingsley might purchase their facility and convert it into a nightclub. By dawn the next day, Seraphina was already being prepped for the operating room.

Nathaniel hadn’t slept. He hadn’t eaten. He stood motionless in the sterile hallway, his jaw clenched, his knuckles white.

Where the master went, the shadow followed. His assistant, Lillian, remained at his side, equally restless.

For a decade, this striking woman had been Nathaniel’s silent sentinel—his personal guard, his unwavering shadow.

The tabloids painted him as a notorious playboy, cycling through women like seasonal trends. Yet the one constant in his chaotic life was Lillian. At every high-profile event requiring an escort, she was the one on his arm.

Strangers often mistook them for lovers. "Mr. Kingsley, your girlfriend is stunning! You two make such a perfect pair!"

Nathaniel usually smirked and played along. "Good eye."

But Lillian knew the truth.

Their relationship was transparent—no blurred lines, no hidden desires. She understood him better than anyone. Despite his rakish reputation, Nathaniel was brutally honest with every woman he entertained.

He dated. He never promised forever. And if he ever married? He’d follow his cousin Alexander’s example—but double the number of wives.

Yet his behavior toward Seraphina defied all logic.

"Mr. Kingsley," Lillian murmured, "the surgery will take hours. You should sit."

"I’m fine." His gaze remained locked on the operating room doors.

"It’s a routine procedure. The success rate is nearly flawless. There’s no need for such worry."

"No need?" Nathaniel’s voice cracked like a whip. "What if her hearing deteriorates? What if she suffers complications? What if she ends up deaf before she’s forty?"

His outburst left Lillian’s ears ringing.

"That damned Genevieve!"

Nathaniel slammed his fist into the wall, his eyes burning with fury. "I won’t let this go. Whether Seraphina recovers or not, I’ll make sure Genevieve pays. I’ll snap every rib in her body!"

A chill slithered down Lillian’s spine. Gathering her courage, she ventured, "Mr. Kingsley… may I ask you something?"

"Speak."

"Do you have feelings for Seraphina?"

The question struck him like a physical blow. His pulse hammered against his ribs.

Feelings?

Did he?

He cared for her—deeply. Too deeply to dismiss it as mere protectiveness toward Alexander’s sister.

But Seraphina was Arabella’s daughter.

Every smile, every hesitant glance from her tugged at him. Her innocence awakened something primal in him—a need to shield her from the world. Yet her lineage erected an impenetrable wall between them.

"Lillian," he rasped, leaning against the wall, his bruised knuckles matching the bloodshot hue of his eyes, "I do care for her. But it ends here."

"Because she’s Arabella’s child?" Lillian pressed.

"Yes." The word scraped from his throat.

"But if you truly love her—"

"I can’t." Nathaniel sank onto a bench, gripping his skull as if to crush the memories surfacing. "I’ll never forget the night my father died. The rain. My mother standing alone in it, screaming until her voice gave out. My uncle smirking at the funeral. I won’t let him take Kingsley Group. I won’t let anything—or anyone—derail me."

Lillian knelt before him, her hand trembling as she pressed it to his heaving back.

"I’ll reclaim everything my father lost, Lillian. I can’t afford distractions. I can’t lose."

Meanwhile, Isabella arrived at The Regal Palace to finalize preparations for her sister’s birthday gala.

Back in her office, her phone buzzed. Alexander’s name flashed on the screen.

"President Kingsley," she answered, her tone frosty, as if last night’s warmth had never existed.

"Isabella." His voice was velvet.

"I don’t know a ‘Alexander.’ Only President Kingsley." Her lips curled.

"Has Grandfather called you?"

"Grandfather? No. Why? Is he alright?" Her spine stiffened.

"It’s not him. It’s Seraphina."

"Seraphina?"

"I didn’t return to Windsor Estates last night. Grandfather called, demanding to know why Nathaniel took her. I only just learned there was an incident."

Fatigue and anger laced his words. "I’ve tried calling Nathaniel. His phone’s off."

"That bastard!"

Isabella shot to her feet, her palm smacking the desk. "I knew he was trouble when he whisked her off to that hotel! And you defended him! Claimed he had boundaries! He’s a wolf in Armani!"

"Isabella, Nathaniel and I grew up together. Yes, he’s a womanizer, but he’s not reckless. Seraphina is my sister. He wouldn’t touch her."

"Your sister?" She scoffed. "The only women safe from him are his mother and hypothetical daughter! Pray he hasn’t laid a finger on her. If he has, I’ll break every bone in his hand. And when I make promises, I keep them."

"Fine."

"What?"

"I said, fine. If he’s crossed the line, you take his left hand. I’ll take the right."

Isabella gaped.

Some friendships were disposable.

The surgery concluded successfully. Seraphina, pale as the hospital sheets, lay in recovery.

"How do you feel? Any pain?" Nathaniel’s voice was uncharacteristically soft as he studied her doe-like eyes.

She shook her head.

"Can you hear me?"

A blink. A nod.

"Good." Relief loosened his shoulders. He reached for his phone. "I’ll call your siblings—"

Seraphina’s hand shot out, gripping his wrist.

"N-Nathaniel… I’m hungry."

"I figured." His lips twitched. "Lillian’s fetching food. She’ll be back soon."

As if summoned, the door opened. Lillian entered, balancing a tray of steaming dishes.

"Mr. Kingsley, as requested—light, easily digestible."

"Give it here."

Nathaniel took the bowl, blew on a spoonful of porridge, and held it to Seraphina’s lips.

"Open up, sweetheart."

Lillian’s eyebrows vanished into her hairline.

Affection, it seemed, was impossible to hide.

"I can feed myself," Seraphina mumbled, flushing.

"You’re weak. Let me."

The spoon brushed her lips. Nathaniel’s smirk turned playful. "Women line up for the privilege of feeding me. The ones I feed? Rarer than unicorns. Consider yourself honored."

Seraphina gulped, her fingers twisting the sheets.

"Being fed by me is a bragging right for years. Now—open wide."
###Chapter 290

The usually composed Isabella Sinclair couldn't suppress a quiet laugh, covering her lips with her delicate fingers.

Poor Alexander Kingsley, she thought. He's trying so hard to impress Seraphina Lockwood. His usual suave demeanor isn't working, so he's resorting to clumsy attempts—often with hilarious results.

Seraphina wasn't trying to be difficult. She simply noticed Alexander struggling with the bowl and spoon, his movements awkward. Concerned, she leaned forward, parting her soft pink lips to accept the spoonful he offered.

Seeing her eat what he'd prepared, Alexander's eyes crinkled with warmth, an involuntary smile tugging at his lips.

She coughed suddenly, having eaten too quickly.

"Slow down," he chided gently, patting her back. "Even if you're hungry, take your time."

His gaze caught on a stray drop of white liquid at the corner of her mouth. His dark eyes darkened further, his cheeks flushing crimson.

Oatmeal.

How long had it been since he'd indulged himself? Why was something as innocent as oatmeal making his thoughts spiral?

"Alexander, the oatmeal is delicious. I want more," Seraphina murmured, noticing his distracted expression.

"Of course," he answered, his voice rough.

At that moment, the hospital door swung open.

"Alexander! You've got some nerve!"

Startled, Seraphina instinctively threw herself into Alexander's arms, her slender fingers clutching his shirt tightly.

Her sudden embrace made his pulse spike, his body acutely aware of her closeness.

"Don't be scared," he whispered against her ear, his tone soothing. "It's just your sister Evelyn and your brother Thaddeus coming to pick you up."

The Abernathys stormed in, freezing at the sight before them.

"Alexander! Keep your hands off Seraphina!" Evelyn's voice was sharp, her heart pounding at the sight of her sister curled protectively in his arms.

Alexander hadn't moved, but her accusation made him tighten his hold reflexively.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, overwhelmed.

An entire night.

Had Alexander really kept his hands to himself? Even if he wasn't actively pursuing her, could any man resist such temptation?

Believing Alexander would behave like a gentleman was laughable.

Thaddeus's expression was stern. "What happened? Why is Seraphina in the hospital?"

Evelyn's sharp eyes caught the bandage on Seraphina's left ear. She rushed forward. "What's this? What happened to her?"

Thaddeus's chest tightened with concern.

Alexander scoffed internally.

Was Seraphina their sister or their prized possession?

"Seraphina just had surgery. I'll explain everything later," Alexander said, his voice low as he stroked her trembling back.

Evelyn sensed there was more but held back. "Grandfather wants Seraphina to return to the Abernathy mansion in Havenbrook. She'll live with him from now on."

"Really? That's wonderful! She's finally free from that hellhole!"

Seraphina stayed silent, but Alexander's heart swelled with relief.

Thaddeus, however, studied Seraphina's anxious expression and realized something. His lips thinned.

"I won't go!" Seraphina suddenly cried out. "I want to stay with Alexander!"

The room fell silent.

Alexander stared down at the teary-eyed girl in his arms, his throat tight. A single thought consumed him: He wanted to take her home.

Desperately.

"Seraphina, you want to stay with him?" Evelyn was speechless.

Seraphina buried her face against Alexander's chest, her breath warm against his skin. "I want to go home with you."

After her insistence, Evelyn and Thaddeus had no choice but to relent.

Thaddeus pulled Alexander aside to the hospital's smoking area.

"Alexander, what happened to Seraphina's ear?" He offered a cigarette, lighting one for himself.

Alexander's eyes burned with fury. "Isn't it obvious? Your precious sister Glynnis is to blame."

"She's not my sister. Seraphina is the only sister I acknowledge."

Just hearing Glynnis's name made Thaddeus's blood boil. His voice turned icy. "Did Glynnis hurt her?"

Alexander nearly crushed the cigarette in his grip. "Thad, if I retaliate against Glynnis, will you stop me out of loyalty to the Abernathys?"

Thaddeus took a slow drag before answering flatly, "Whatever you tell me today, I never heard."

His stance couldn't be clearer.

Alexander smirked, clapping Thaddeus on the shoulder. "Thanks, brother."

"Teach her a lesson, but don't kill her. I'm thinking about your future."

Thaddeus gave him a pointed look. "If you're serious about Seraphina, you need to clean up your act. Cut ties with other women. Stop the violence. You're a Kingsley, not a thug. I won't let her near you like this."

"Thad, I only see her as a sister. Nothing more," Alexander lied, regret twisting in his chest.

His fingers trembled slightly around the cigarette, betraying him.

Thaddeus studied him before speaking casually. "Don't let my issues with Elspeth affect you. Seraphina might be her daughter, but I've never held that against her. She's a good girl. She deserves happiness."

"Thad—" Alexander's voice cracked, emotion overwhelming him.

"You're far from perfect," Thaddeus continued, exhaling smoke. "But I see sincerity in you when it comes to her. So, I'm willing to give you a chance."

His tone was almost paternal.

Alexander scowled. Since when did Thaddeus act like a father figure?

Thaddeus reached for the cigarette. "Are you smoking that or not?"

Alexander jerked it back. "Since when are you so stingy? You're a billionaire. Can't spare one cigarette?"

"I'm quitting. Down to half a pack a day."

"Why? Turning thirty and suddenly health-conscious?"

"For Evelyn." Thaddeus's expression softened. "She hates the smell. I know it's hard, but I'm trying."

Alexander scoffed. "She hated Acacia too. Why didn't you ditch her back then?"

Thaddeus's face darkened. "I know my past is ugly. You don't need to remind me. But my heart is set now. In this lifetime, Evelyn is the only one for me."

By evening, Seraphina woke to find Alexander had prepared dinner.

"Seraphina," he murmured, sitting on the edge of her bed, his tone teasing. "Were you serious about coming home with me?"

She bit her lip, nodding before shaking her head.

Curled in her oversized hospital gown, her bare feet peeked out, delicate and unconsciously alluring.

Alexander's gaze lingered, heat flaring in his veins.

"I want to live with Grandfather," she admitted softly. "But I want to recover first. I don't want to worry him."

"I understand."

He stroked her hair gently before smirking. "But Seraphina, do you really trust me that much? Do you know how terrible my reputation is? Aren't you afraid you're jumping from the frying pan into the fire?"

She lifted her clear, innocent eyes to his. "I don't care what others say. To me, you're a good person. Like Thaddeus."

Alexander's heart hammered violently. His fingers trailed from her hair to the nape of her neck.

Seeing his silence, she grew nervous. "Did I cause trouble? Do you not want me with you?"

Her confusion was genuine, her words dangerously naive.

Suddenly, her sweet scent enveloped him.

His breath hitched.

Then her arms wrapped around his neck, pulling him down.

Her soft lips met his in a clumsy, innocent kiss.

Alexander stiffened, his control fraying as he barely managed to pull back.

Seraphina, eyes closed, recalled their first kiss. Tentatively, her tongue traced his lips, seeking entry.

A jolt of electricity shot through him. He tore away, panting, his eyes dark with desire. "Seraphina, what are you doing?"

She blinked up at him earnestly. "Don't you like this? I want to repay you."

"Repay me?" He was stunned.

"I won't take your kindness for granted. You enjoy this, don't you? I'm not good yet, but I can learn."

Alexander's blood roared in his ears.

"Seraphina," he growled. "Do you have any idea how dangerous you are to a man right now?"

"Dangerous?" She tilted her head, oblivious.

With a low groan, he captured her lips again, his kiss deep and possessive.

Her breath hitched as his hands slid to her waist.

Then, with aching gentleness, he lowered her onto the pristine white sheets.
###Chapter 291

Isabella didn't bother saying goodbye to Alexander when she left the hospital.

The man had left her with an unfinished story, but her pride wouldn't let her ask for more. Even though curiosity gnawed at her, she'd rather uncover the truth herself than beg for answers from him.

After three years of humiliation, she, the heiress of the Sinclair family, had sworn to never lower her head again.

On her way home, her phone buzzed—Olivia was calling.

"Miss Isabella, I tried digging into Alexander's past but found nothing suspicious. However, when I looked into Mr. Nathaniel's personal affairs, I stumbled upon something... odd."

"Alexander is now the CEO of Kingsley Enterprises. His personal files are classified, accessible only to a select few." Isabella smiled faintly. "Smart move, Olivia. Indirect routes can be more revealing."

Olivia chuckled, pleased with the praise. "Mr. Nathaniel was kidnapped when he was eleven."

"Kidnapped?"

"Yes. But there's no trace of it online. The Kingsleys made sure to bury that information. If you really want details, I could ask my father. He was a judge at the Elmsworth Court back then—he might know something."

"No need. You've done enough."

Isabella hung up, her mind racing. She knew Olivia's family situation was complicated and didn't want to drag them into this. But now that she had a lead, she knew exactly where to go next.

As her La Voiture Noire pulled up to the mansion, the headlights illuminated a tall, striking figure standing at the entrance.

Her breath caught.

Alexander.

He turned toward her, his eyes glinting under the bright lights. Straightening his posture, he offered her a warm smile—one that once made her heart race.

She had to admit, Alexander had a devastating smile.

The kind she'd once dreamed of, the one she'd desperately craved.

For three years, she'd bent over backward to earn his affection—lavish gifts, learning his favorite recipes—all for a glimpse of that smile. But it had been futile.

Now, here he was, smiling at her freely, even claiming to like her.

But could his affection ever fill the void he'd left in her heart?

Taking a deep breath, she stepped out of the car and approached him.

"Isabella."

"What? Here to rob me?" Her tone was sharp, devoid of warmth.

"I wanted to talk at the hospital, but you left in a hurry." He ignored her coldness, his voice soft.

"If not for Evelyn, we'd never have crossed paths. There's nothing left to say."

She turned toward the mansion. "I'll send someone with the next round of medication in a few days. Take it regularly if you want to live longer."

"Isabella, wait!" He reached for her.

She paused, glancing back. "Oh, and tell Daniel I know he has feelings for Evelyn. But I don’t approve of them being together."

Alexander stiffened, his brows furrowing.

"I know—I’m no longer her sister-in-law. Just an outsider now. But I’ve decided to interfere anyway."

Her voice was icy. "In the Kingsley family, only your grandfather has any real control over Evelyn. But he’s old and frail. Her parents are useless. And you? Her brother? You’ve proven utterly worthless. You were never there when she needed you. You don’t care."

Each word was a bullet to his chest. His fists clenched.

"So from now on, Evelyn is my sister. My family."

Her resolve was unshakable. "I will never allow her to be with Daniel. And I will stop him from pursuing her."

"Why not?" Alexander stepped forward, his gaze burning.

She mistook his intensity for defiance. "Why not? Alexander, do you even have a heart? Or do you think because Evelyn isn’t your blood sister, you can sacrifice her for your friend’s desires?"

His lips trembled with suppressed anger.

He wasn’t angry at her. He understood her protectiveness, her fierce love for Evelyn.

But he couldn’t let her misunderstand him—or belittle his only friend.

"Daniel genuinely cares for Evelyn. You saw it today. She relies on him. She wants to be with him."

"Dependency isn’t love. Evelyn has autism. She barely attended school, had no social life. How could she possibly understand romantic feelings?"

Her frustration echoed into the night.

"Daniel will treat her right. Just give them a chance." His voice was almost pleading.

"First, let’s not forget Daniel’s extensive dating history. His list of exes could fill a phone book. Even playboys settle down, but Evelyn isn’t the woman to gamble on that possibility."

"Second, do you honestly think the Fairhaven family is the right environment for her?"

Alexander faltered.

They rarely discussed Daniel’s family—a topic Daniel avoided like the plague.

Alexander had never pried, not wanting to reopen old wounds.

"Mrs. Fairhaven is traditional. Her husband died young, leaving her only Daniel. She’s pinned all her hopes on him. She can’t even stand Glynnis—how would she ever accept Evelyn? Daniel’s a devoted son. Do you think he’d defy his mother for her?"

"Then there’s Edith—scheming, manipulative. She’s always used Glynnis as a pawn. She despises Elspeth’s daughter. You think she’d treat Evelyn any better?"

"If Evelyn marries into that family, she’ll be trapped in endless drama, power struggles, petty fights. Even if Daniel loves her, love withers under that toxicity. Evelyn is innocent. How could she possibly survive?"

Her eyes glistened with unshed tears.

In that moment, under the moonlight, she looked ethereal—like an angel carved from ice.

Alexander’s chest tightened with guilt, regret, remorse.

She wasn’t just talking about Evelyn.

She was voicing her own pain—the years of loneliness, the sacrifices she’d made, the love she’d begged for but never received.

This wasn’t about letting go.

It was about swallowing the bitterness and enduring the heartache.

Isabella had said her piece. If he still refused to see reason, she’d take matters into her own hands.

As she turned to leave, Alexander’s control snapped.

He pulled her into his arms.

Her breath hitched, her pulse erratic.

"I’m sorry. It’s my fault. I didn’t consider your feelings. I won’t bring it up again—I promise."

His arm locked around her waist, pulling her flush against him. His other hand cradled her shoulder, holding her so tightly it was as if he wanted to merge her into his very being.

She stiffened, his deep voice sending shivers down her spine.

"Let go, Alexander." Her protest came out as a whisper.

"No."

He nuzzled his jaw against her neck. "Isabella, I’ve never been greedy—but with you, I’m insatiable. Holding you, I never want to let go. Kissing you will never be enough."

His words were simple, yet they unraveled her.

Under the moonlight, their silhouettes melded together—two striking figures bound by a love as fierce as it was fractured.

"Isabella."

A voice, gentle yet chilling, cut through the night.
###Chapter 292

That voice cut through the air like a blade.

It struck Alexander Kingsley straight through the heart.

Isabella Sinclair snapped out of her daze, her pulse racing as if caught red-handed. She twisted violently, breaking free from Alexander's iron grip before shoving him away with all her might.

Alexander stumbled back, his arms empty.

Only cold air remained where she'd been.

"Mr. Lockwood, what are you doing here?" Isabella's voice shook despite her efforts to steady it. Her wide eyes betrayed her panic.

Beneath his tailored grey suit, Sebastian Lockwood's body trembled with barely contained fury. He adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses, his glare at Alexander burning with undisguised hatred.

Alexander caught the fleeting expression. His starry eyes narrowed dangerously, a predator sensing a challenge.

When it came to intimidation, Alexander Kingsley never backed down.

Especially not in front of the woman he loved.

Isabella saw the murderous glint in Alexander's eyes and knew he wanted to tear Sebastian apart.

She thought bitterly, "He's the one who crossed the line first. What did Sebastian do wrong except interrupt his little game? Shameless man!"

"Isabella! Are you alright?"

Sebastian moved swiftly to her side, his voice softening with concern. "Do you need help?"

"No, I'm fine." She forced a smile, though her forehead glistened with sweat.

Alexander's jealousy burned like wildfire.

That smile - she hadn't given him one like that in so long.

Now she offered it freely to Sebastian.

"You don't look fine." Sebastian positioned himself protectively beside her, radiating ownership without touching her. He glanced dismissively at Alexander. "Should I have him removed?"

The casual threat hung in the air like a declaration of war.

Alexander's fists clenched, knuckles white.

If Isabella weren't present, Sebastian would already be on the floor.

"He can leave on his own." Isabella's voice was ice, refusing to look at Alexander.

"Then, Isabella, will you come with me?"

Her eyes widened in surprise.

Alexander's control snapped. "Sebastian," he growled, "do you even hear yourself?"

"Perfectly. Unlike some who don't know how to behave."

Sebastian stepped fully between them, smirking. "Can't you see she loathes you? You're not her husband anymore. Keep this up and I'll have you arrested, Mr. Kingsley."

"Enough." Isabella lowered her lashes, speaking to Alexander with finality. "Leave. Now."

"Isabella!"

"I said go!" Her temper flared. "I don't want to see you, Alexander. Not now. Not ever."

The words hit like a physical blow, draining color from Alexander's face.

His jaw locked, rage choking him.

Sebastian's lips curled in a secret, satisfied smile.

Few things in life truly satisfied him.

But hurting Alexander Kingsley? That always did.

"Why are you here, Mr. Lockwood?" Isabella finally asked.

"I've moved in. Right behind your villa." His gaze softened. "We're neighbors now."

"What?" Shock flashed across her features.

Alexander felt a cold dread settle in his stomach.

"I said we're neighbors, Isabella." Sebastian tilted his head, extending a well-manicured hand. "Hello, new neighbor. Looking forward to getting to know you better."

Bemused, Isabella shook his hand politely.

Just like that, she erased Alexander - her ex-husband, the man who should have been closest to her - from the equation.

"Isabella, would you like to see my new place?" Sebastian seized the opportunity. "I've got fresh salmon, lobster - all your favorites. I'll cook for you." Every syllable dripped with affection.

The perfect gentleman every woman dreamed of.

"Another time. We'll have plenty of chances as neighbors." Her mind reeled; this wasn't the moment for house tours.

"My mother's joining us tonight."

Sebastian's earnest gaze held hers. "I told her I'd invite you. She was delighted - it's been years since she last saw you."

"Mrs. Lockwood returned from Geneva?"

"Yes, I brought her back." His smile widened.

"How wonderful."

Alexander was dying inside.

Helpless. Useless. A spectator in his own tragedy.

Alexander Kingsley, titan of industry, reduced to this - a fool, a joke.

"Isabella, you know her condition. Her lucid moments are rare." Sebastian's eyes clouded with melancholy, expertly playing on sympathies. "I'd consider it a personal favor if you could see her while she's coherent. Would you mind?"

Between family ties and Sebastian's plea, refusal seemed impossible. Her evening was free anyway.

"Of course, Mr. Lockwood."

Alexander vibrated with suppressed fury.

"No trouble at all. Thank you for indulging me." Sebastian's eyes sparkled as he gestured gallantly for Isabella to precede him.

They walked out together, leaving Alexander behind.

But he wasn't defeated yet. Alexander Kingsley didn't surrender - not to Sebastian Lockwood, not when the woman he loved was walking away with another man.

His heart hammered as he lunged forward.

"Isabella!"

Sebastian anticipated the move. Whirling around, his fist connected with Alexander's jaw in a vicious punch!
###Chapter 293

A sharp gust of wind sliced through the air, grazing Nathaniel's face.

It was sudden.

Brutal.

Unforgiving.

If he hadn't reacted in time—if his reflexes weren't honed to perfection—he wouldn't have dodged that strike.

One move.

That was all it took for Nathaniel to see the truth.

Beneath Adrian's polished exterior lurked something feral. A beast barely restrained.

Nathaniel would never let Isabella leave with him.

Never.

The confrontation erupted too fast. Isabella, oblivious, continued walking ahead, unaware of the storm brewing behind her.

Adrian swung again.

Nathaniel sidestepped, countering with a swift kick that narrowly missed Adrian's chest.

Adrian staggered back, barely keeping his balance. His hands, usually hidden beneath crisp silver cufflinks, clenched into fists, trembling with barely suppressed rage.

Nathaniel stood firm, unshaken.

Adrian adjusted his glasses, his eyes burning with something dark.

For years, Adrian had trained relentlessly—martial arts, firearms, combat—pushing himself to the brink, all to protect what was his.

He had been confident in his skills.

But facing Nathaniel?

He realized his mistake.

Nathaniel wasn't just strong.

He was a force of nature.

A slow, dangerous smirk curled Adrian's lips, sending a chill down Nathaniel's spine.

Those eyes, so tender when they looked at Isabella, now gleamed with something twisted.

Then—

Adrian lunged.

Nathaniel's fist connected with Adrian's cheek before he could stop himself.

Isabella turned.

She saw everything.

And so did Nathaniel—the blood on Adrian's lips, the smirk still in place.

Damn it.

He'd been played.

Adrian never intended to fight.

He wanted Nathaniel to hit him.

"Ave!"

Isabella rushed forward, catching Adrian before he could fall.

The childhood nickname slipped out before she could stop it.

Adrian froze.

Then his grip on her wrist tightened. "What did you just call me?"

Isabella hesitated.

Then, softly, she repeated it. "Ave."

Adrian's breath hitched.

Fifteen years.

That was how long he'd waited to hear that name from her lips again.

Nathaniel's face drained of color.

Something inside him shattered.

They were that close?

After all this time?

And what was he to her?

"Nathaniel, have you lost your mind?" Isabella's voice was sharp, her eyes blazing. "Adrian was just taking me to visit his mother. What did he do to deserve this?"

Nathaniel's jaw clenched.

He had no defense.

No excuse.

Only one question burned in his chest.

"What do I mean to you?"

Isabella flinched.

The pain in his voice cut deeper than she expected.

Adrian watched, his gaze like a blade pressed to Nathaniel's throat.

"If you stay out of my life," Isabella said coldly, "we might remain business associates. If not, we're enemies."

Then she turned away, supporting Adrian as they walked off.

Nathaniel stood there, hollow.

The wind howled around him, but he barely felt it.

His blood had gone cold.

His tears dried before they could fall.

Some loves were never meant to reach their destination.

Adrian's mansion was the second largest in Beverly Hills.

The first belonged to Isabella.

The entire neighborhood was Chambers property—Adrian could move houses on a whim.

Isabella frowned at Adrian's injuries. "Does it hurt?"

Adrian smiled, though it pulled at the bruise. "Not much."

"That brute," Isabella muttered, wishing she could throttle Nathaniel.

"Military training makes men like him ruthless," Adrian said lightly.

Isabella's eyes narrowed. "You've been investigating him?"

Adrian met her gaze. "He's my rival in business and in love. I need to know my enemy."

Isabella pressed her lips together.

Adrian's feelings were no secret.

But she pretended not to see.

"When my mother asks about this," Adrian said, feigning worry, "you'll cover for me, right?"

Isabella rolled her eyes. "Should I tell her you tripped over your own feet?"

Adrian chuckled, his gaze softening.

Then Isabella had an idea.

She pulled out a compact. "Here. Use this."

Adrian blinked. "What is it?"

"You don't know how to use concealer?"

He shook his head.

"Then let me help."

She dabbed powder onto the bruise, her touch feather-light.

Adrian winced.

"Did I hurt you?"

He leaned closer, his breath warm against her skin. "Not anymore."

Their faces were inches apart.

Isabella could smell the mint on his breath, mixed with the faint scent of violets on his clothes.

Her pulse skipped.

She stepped back abruptly, nearly dropping the compact.

Just because she'd used his childhood nickname didn't mean anything had changed.

"Let's go," Adrian said smoothly. "If we don't hurry, dinner will be late."

He knew better than to push.

Patience was key.

As they disappeared inside, Nathaniel remained on the street, staring at the lit windows.

Alone.

His eyes burned.
###Chapter 294

The entire villa was pristine, every piece of furniture untouched. It was obvious Alexander had just moved in.

The interior design was sleek and modern, dominated by a monochrome palette—black, white, and gray. Isabella immediately recognized the high-end brands of the furnishings, a quiet testament to wealth.

As she stepped inside, an inexplicable chill ran down her spine, making her shiver slightly.

It wasn’t the temperature. The emptiness of the space, paired with the stark colors, created an almost clinical atmosphere.

"Isabella, are you cold?"

Alexander retrieved a pair of plush white slippers from the shoe cabinet, kneeling on one knee to offer them to her. "Put these on. I’ll turn up the heat."

She blinked, slipping her delicate feet into the warm slippers.

They were soft.

Perfectly sized, as if made just for her.

"Mr. Kingsley, welcome home," greeted Margaret, their longtime housekeeper, with a warm smile.

"Isabella, this is Margaret," Alexander introduced.

"Oh, I know! This must be Ms. Isabella, the one you’ve been waiting for!" Margaret beamed, studying Isabella with admiration. "You’re absolutely stunning. More beautiful than any pageant queen I’ve ever seen!"

Isabella flushed at the compliment. "Thank you, Margaret."

"Come in, it’s freezing outside. Mrs. Kingsley is waiting for you!"

Margaret led them to the living room, glancing back at them with increasing delight. The more she looked, the more she saw how perfectly matched they were.

A flicker of unease settled in Isabella’s chest.

Her memories of Mrs. Kingsley were hazy.

As a child visiting the Kingsley estate, Mr. Kingsley had always greeted them, while his wife rarely appeared. From the few encounters, Isabella remembered her as gentle and kind.

"Mother!"

At Alexander’s call, the middle-aged woman wrapped in a camel-colored blanket turned her wheelchair around.

Isabella’s heart clenched.

Mrs. Kingsley was around the same age as her own mother, yet she looked frail, her hair streaked with silver.

"My son! You’re home!"

Mrs. Kingsley’s face lit up with joy. Despite her age, her smile held traces of the beauty she once possessed.

Alexander strode forward and embraced her. "Mother, Ms. Isabella is here to see you."

"Is it really Isabella? My dear, come closer!"

Mrs. Kingsley’s eyes sparkled with childlike excitement, brimming with affection. "Margaret, quickly!"

"Yes, ma’am!"

"Bring some juice and candies for Isabella!"

"Right away!"

Margaret hurriedly scooped a handful of colorful candies from an ornate box on the coffee table, offering them eagerly. "Ms. Isabella, please have some!"

Isabella hesitated before accepting them.

She hadn’t expected such a warm, nostalgic welcome.

"Alex, you should invite your friends over more often! I don’t mind—I just worry you’ll be lonely," Mrs. Kingsley said, her gaze filled with maternal concern.

Isabella’s eyes widened as she glanced at Alexander.

"Don’t worry, Mother. With Isabella here, I’m never alone."

A shadow of sadness flickered in Alexander’s eyes as he gently patted his mother’s back. "Even if everyone else leaves, she’ll always stay by my side."

"That’s wonderful! Isabella, you must visit us often!" Mrs. Kingsley’s expression softened as she looked at Isabella, as if she still saw the little girl from years ago.

"Thank you, Mrs. Kingsley."

Touched, Isabella knelt before her, her face radiant with a warm smile. "Don’t worry. Alexander will never be lonely as long as I’m his friend."

Alexander removed his suit jacket, revealing a crisp white shirt and gray vest that accentuated his lean frame. He exuded effortless elegance as he headed toward the kitchen.

Though a guest, Isabella couldn’t let him cook alone.

She followed.

"Let me help. Without a chef, this will take forever." She surveyed the premium ingredients spread across the counter and rolled up her sleeves.

"It’s fine. Everything’s prepped. Seafood cooks quickly."

Then his expression softened with concern. "Isabella, I remember you’re allergic to smoke. The kitchen might get smoky. Why don’t you stay with Mother?"

She froze. "How did you know?"

"Years ago, when your father brought you to our house, my brother wanted a barbecue. The smoke started billowing, and your father rushed you away, saying you couldn’t tolerate it. I’ve never forgotten how frantic he was—like it was a life-or-death situation."

Alexander chuckled. "He adored you."

Isabella stared at him, an overwhelming sorrow tightening her throat.

She fought back tears, but they glistened in her eyes anyway.

For three years, she had lived with Nathaniel. Cooked for him. And he’d never noticed.

Yet Alexander remembered a moment from over a decade ago.

"It’s fine. I’ll help."

She stood beside him at the sink, her head bowed as she deftly prepped the ingredients.

Alexander’s gaze darkened. He subtly stepped closer.

"Isabella, thank you."

"For dinner? You’re the one hosting."

"No." His voice was low, rough with emotion. "For indulging me. My mother… her memory fades. Sometimes she doesn’t recognize me. Sometimes she thinks I’m still a child."

"I understand. It’s part of her condition."

"I’m grateful you played along to make her happy."

They turned at the same time, their foreheads brushing accidentally.

A pause. Then laughter.

Inside, the villa was warm, alive with joy.

Outside, the winter wind howled.

Nathaniel stood motionless in the cold, his gaze fixed on the glowing windows.

He didn’t know how long he’d been there. Or how much longer he’d stay.

Only one thought consumed him.

He would wait.

She would come out.

Wouldn’t she?

A sudden chill kissed his face, seeping into his bones.

He looked up.

Snowflakes drifted down, melting against his skin.

The first snow of the season.

Isabella, if we share this snowfall, it’s like growing old together.

I want to share this with you.

His breath fogged in the air as he pulled out his phone and dialed her number.
###Chapter 295

The evening was filled with warmth and laughter.

Nathaniel had planned to uncork his finest vintage wine, but Mrs. Vanderbilt insisted Seraphina stick to juice. By the end of dinner, Seraphina had sampled every flavor—orange, grape, pineapple—enough to stock a juice bar.

After the meal, Olivia guided Mrs. Vanderbilt away, leaving Nathaniel and Seraphina alone.

He led her through his sprawling estate, showcasing his prized collection of ancient artifacts and masterpieces. Each piece was a treasure worth millions, some once owned by royalty.

Seraphina leaned over an exquisite Renaissance painting, her magnifying glass in hand, eyes alight with admiration.

"Do you like them?" Nathaniel rested against the bedpost, watching her with a soft smile. "They're yours if you want them."

She studied the art.

He studied her.

"These are priceless," she said, straightening up and peering at him through the glass with a playful wink. "Are you a collector or just a dealer? A true enthusiast would guard them like Dominic—never letting anyone near them, much less gifting them away."

Nathaniel's lips curved. "I'm only this generous with two people—you and Dominic."

Her breath hitched.

Nathaniel and Sebastian were worlds apart. One spoke words that melted her heart, while the other could barely manage a kind sentence even under duress.

"Dominic would drain you dry if he knew you had these treasures," she teased.

"If he wants them, they're his." Nathaniel's gaze never wavered. "The only things I own that might interest him are these artifacts, and I’d gladly part with them. But you—what do you want?"

Seraphina arched a brow. "Besides a stake in the Vanderbilt empire?"

His eyes darkened with unspoken words. You.

Instead, he murmured, "It's snowing, Seraphina."

Her face lit up like the stars.

She adored snow. As a child, her mother would cradle her in the garden, guiding her tiny fingers across frost-kissed surfaces.

"Let's go see it," Nathaniel said.

On the balcony, the world was a canvas of swirling white. Snowflakes danced like scattered petals, painting the night in silent beauty.

"It's breathtaking!" Seraphina tipped her head back, grinning.

Nathaniel shrugged off his coat and draped it over her shoulders, pulling her close. "Beautiful, yes. But I’d rather you not catch a cold."

Warmth seeped into her bones, his scent wrapping around her.

She turned—and found his gaze burning into hers.

"Your glasses are fogged," she said, feigning seriousness. "Can you even see the snow?"

He chuckled, eyes full of affection.

In Helgen, there was a saying: If you want to marry her, watch the first snowfall of winter with her.

Seraphina, cheeks pink from the cold, reached out to catch a snowflake.

Nathaniel's pulse quickened. He wanted to lace his fingers through hers and never let go.

Then her phone rang.

Her smile faltered as she glanced at the screen.

Sebastian.

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. His voice was soft but edged with ice. "Seraphina."

She hesitated, then answered. "Hello."

Disappointment coiled in Nathaniel's chest.

And hatred for Sebastian flared.

Outside, Sebastian stood in the snow, oblivious to her presence just beyond the glass. His voice was rough. "Seraphina. It's snowing. The first snowfall in Elmsworth."

"I noticed," she said flatly.

A pause. Then, strained: "Will you watch it with me tonight?"

She scoffed. "Are you a goldfish? Do you only remember things for seven seconds?"

"I—"

"What exactly is our relationship, Sebastian? Do you think this is appropriate?"

"More appropriate than you being with Nathaniel." Bitterness dripped from his words.

Seraphina's temper flared. "Hardly."

"I won't leave until I see you," he growled.

"Then freeze to death," she snapped.

"Seraphina, are you trying to kill me?" His voice cracked. "Are you really staying at Nathaniel's tonight? Do you even realize what you're doing?"

She stormed away from Nathaniel, lowering her voice. "Sebastian, I appreciate that you saved my life. But that doesn't give you the right to manipulate me."

"I just want to watch the snow with you. That's all."

"And I don’t want to!" Her voice broke. "Not with you. Never again."

Sebastian flinched.

Nathaniel was at her side in an instant, hands steadying her trembling shoulders. "Seraphina," he murmured, lips brushing her ear.

Sebastian heard every word.

Her eyes squeezed shut, lashes damp.

Two years ago, on Christmas Eve—the first snowfall in Elmsworth.

A car crash. Blood. Their unborn child, barely two months along.

She had screamed herself hoarse in that hospital bed, shattered by loss.

And Sebastian?

He had been overseas with his childhood sweetheart, celebrating without her.

When she’d called him, bleeding and broken, the line had been dead.

Now, the memories choked her. Her knees buckled.

"Seraphina!"

Nathaniel caught her just as she collapsed, fury blazing in his eyes.

Outside, Sebastian stood alone, snow piling on his shoulders.

The gates creaked open.

Hope flickered—then died.

Nathaniel strode toward him, face like ice.

"Where is she?" Sebastian demanded.

Nathaniel adjusted his glasses, smirking. "She’s staying the night. She won’t be seeing you. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to get back to her."

Sebastian’s fists clenched. "You think you’ve won her with your schemes?"

"Does it matter?" Nathaniel’s mask slipped, revealing a predator’s grin. "I’ll do whatever it takes for the woman I love. Unlike you—playing the saint while abandoning her every holiday for your precious Acacia."

Sebastian paled.

"Valentine’s Day. Christmas. Acacia’s birthday—you were always with her, weren’t you?" Nathaniel’s laugh was cruel. "And now you come crawling back? Pathetic."

Sebastian staggered, chest caving.

"Get lost," Nathaniel spat. "You don’t deserve her."

He turned, leaving Sebastian standing in the snow.

A choked gasp.

Sebastian doubled over, blood splattering the pristine white.

Back inside, Nathaniel didn’t rush to Seraphina’s side.

Instead, he dialed his secretary.

"Dig up everything on Sebastian’s medical records. I want to know what’s wrong with him."

His lips curled.

Tonight had been perfect.

And Sebastian’s suffering was just the beginning.
###Chapter 296

The morning light barely touched the windows when Isabella stirred from her restless sleep.

Her eyes flew open as she jolted upright, heart pounding against her ribs.

The room smelled distinctly masculine - a mix of sandalwood and something undeniably expensive. "Sebastian's place?"

A sharp pain lanced through her temples as fragmented memories surfaced.

She recalled shouting at Nathaniel last night. The rest was a black void, like scenes deleted from a movie reel.

Her fingers dug into the silk sheets before she flung them aside and marched downstairs.

In the kitchen, Sebastian stood bathed in golden sunlight, sleeves rolled up as he arranged breakfast with meticulous precision.

The sight was almost domestic. Almost intimate.

"Mr. Lockwood."

He turned, those hazel eyes warming instantly. "Morning, Isabella. How's your head?"

"Where are my shoes?" Her voice could freeze hell over.

"Still Sebastian, I see." His mouth twitched as he wiped his hands. "You collapsed from exhaustion and hypoglycemia last night. My guest room was the nearest option."

"I need to leave."

She wasn't some naive debutante. But staying at a virtual stranger's penthouse crossed every boundary she'd ever set.

The toast popped up. Sebastian ignored it. "At least eat something."

"Not hungry." Her phone buzzed with Oliver's caller ID. "Yes?"

"We're outside Lockwood's tower." Her brother's voice held barely restrained fury. "All of us."

Isabella groaned, imagining the fleet of black SUVs blocking Manhattan traffic. "This isn't necessary."

"Not necessary?" Adrian's voice crackled through the speaker. "You vanished for twelve hours with that—"

"I'm coming out." She hung up abruptly.

Sebastian blocked the doorway. "Let me explain to them."

"Move." Her stiletto hovered dangerously close to his Italian loafers. "Unless you want broken toes with your breakfast."

Outside, the scene was worse than she'd imagined. Three brothers, two bodyguards, and a very agitated assistant formed a human barricade.

"Did he touch you?" Oliver gripped her shoulders, scanning for bruises.

"Please." She rolled her eyes. "Like I'd let some Wall Street playboy—"

"Ms. Sinclair." Sebastian appeared behind her, smiling at the glowering semicircle. "Gentlemen."

Adrian reached for his handcuffs. "One wrong move, Lockwood."

"Enough!" Isabella shoved between them. "I'm fine. Let's go."

But Sebastian wasn't finished. "Regardless of what you think of me," his gaze locked onto hers, "my feelings haven't changed."

The temperature seemed to drop ten degrees.

Oliver stepped forward, all six-foot-three of him radiating menace. "We need to talk. Alone."

Inside, the penthouse's marble floors echoed with tension.

Sebastian poured coffee neither of them touched. "Ask whatever you—"

"Cut the crap." Oliver's knuckles whitened around his phone. "My sister doesn't faint. She doesn't stay at men's penthouses. Explain."

"Your precious Nathaniel called last night." Sebastian's cup clinked sharply against its saucer. "Whatever he said shattered her. She collapsed mid-sentence."

A muscle jumped in Oliver's jaw. "And you didn't call us?"

"Would you have believed me?" Sebastian adjusted his cufflinks. "Or assumed I'd drugged her?"

"Listen carefully." Oliver stood, looming over the seated man. "Flirt with her all you want. But if you ever—and I mean ever—take advantage of her again, the Sinclair name won't protect you."

Sebastian smiled as the elevator doors closed. "We'll see who needs protection, Mr. Sinclair."

His phone buzzed immediately. "Report."

"Two updates, sir." His assistant's voice crackled. "First, Ms. Arabella returns from Paris tonight."

"And?"

"Mr. Nathaniel's medical records show a recent hospitalization. Critical condition. Elmsworth Medical Center."

Sebastian's grin turned feral. "How... unfortunate."

"Shall we arrange an accident?"

"Patience." He traced the rim of his untouched coffee cup. "I want him to see Isabella in my arms first. Then..." His thumb sliced across his throat.

The line went dead. Outside, Manhattan glittered indifferently. Somewhere in its maze of streets, Nathaniel Kingsley was living on borrowed time.
###Chapter 297

The sleek private jet bearing the Kingsley crest landed at Elmsworth Airport under the cover of night.

Isabella descended the stairs, her auburn waves tumbling over the fur-lined collar of her designer coat. The waiting limousine door swung open to swallow her whole.

Since the Victoria Sterling scandal, Alexander had kept her under virtual house arrest - no phone, no friends, no outside contact. His attempt to quarantine her from further scandal.

She'd tried everything. Tears. Screaming matches. Even refusing meals for three days straight.

Margaret Kingsley, torn between maternal instinct and her son's iron will, finally brokered a compromise. Isabella would return to their Aetheria estate for "reflection."

Winter's arrival became Alexander's reluctant permission slip.

Now, after months of isolation that had frayed her nerves to breaking point, Isabella seethed at her brother's absence. "Where is Alexander? Why isn't he here?" Her stiletto connected with the back of Preston's seat.

Preston Carter had known Isabella since pigtails and scraped knees. Though Alexander's most trusted security chief, he'd always had a soft spot for the tempestuous Kingsley heiress. His hesitation spoke volumes. "Mr. Kingsley's schedule has been... demanding."

"Demanding?" Her manicured nails dug into the leather. "He always made time before! Not one call in three months!" A single tear betrayed her fury. "He's forgotten he even has a sister!"

The dam broke. Sobs wracked her frame.

Preston's resolve crumbled. Leaning close, he murmured, "Miss Isabella... there's something you should know. But you must remain calm."

She snatched the proffered handkerchief. "Out with it."

"Mr. Kingsley has been... preoccupied with Ms. Valentina."

Her head snapped up. "That talentless hack?"

"There's more." Preston's voice dropped further. "They've been cohabiting at the Skywatch villa."

The limousine interior suddenly felt airless. "Impossible! No woman has ever set foot in Kingsley Manor!"

"Not the manor. A separate property."

"Take me there. Now."

The Kingsley villa stood like a pearl among the Skywatch district's elite homes. While lacking the ancestral estate's grandeur, its manicured grounds offered privacy - the perfect love nest.

Alexander, notorious playboy who'd once canceled an entire business trip when his sister skinned her knee, hadn't left Valentina's side in weeks. Even Lily Bennett, his longtime housekeeper, marveled at the transformation.

"Alexander! Your surprise is ready!" Valentina's voice trilled across the snow-dusted garden. The crimson wool cloak framed her porcelain features like a winter rose.

Lily watched from the terrace. Even she, immune to most feminine wiles, found the girl's enthusiasm infectious. No wonder Alexander was smitten.

"Careful - icy patches everywhere." Alexander's warning carried more tenderness than Lily had heard in years. He'd carried Valentina everywhere since her illness, as if the marble floors might steal her away.

The garden glittered under its frosty blanket. Among the crystalline trees, Valentina moved like a cardinal in fresh snow - impossible to ignore, impossible to resist.

"Look!" She pointed triumphantly at a lopsided snowman. "I made him for you!"

Alexander's initial delight curdled upon inspection. The snowman bore his face - via an unflattering black-and-white printout.

"Why this photo? I have hundreds better."

Her nose scrunched adorably. "I snuck it! Wanted to surprise you."

"But monochrome?"

"The color printer was out of ink."

Alexander sighed, adjusting her woolen cap. A gift was a gift, even if it made him look like a Depression-era gangster.

Chaos arrived on four paws. Coco, his Doberman, launched at the snowman with gleeful abandon.

"Coco! Heel!" Too late. The snowman's head went rolling.

"Alexander... your head fell off." Valentina observed.

Coco, interpreting this as a new game, began dribbling the icy skull like a soccer ball.

"Look! He's playing keep-away with your head!" Valentina clapped.

Alexander's roar shook snow from the branches. "Coco! You're dog stew if you don't drop that right now!"

The Doberman whimpered, pressing against Valentina's legs.

"No! Don't hurt him!" She seized Alexander's hand with unexpected strength. "I'll rebuild it. Better this time!"

Alexander's anger dissolved. He stroked her cheek. "Only because you asked, little one." Then, softer: "Coco, you'd be sleeping outside tonight if not for your mother's mercy."

The endearment slipped out. His pulse stuttered.

But Valentina was already gathering fresh snow, blissfully unaware.

Or was she?

The question burned hotter than any winter chill.
###Chapter 298

Mari skipped toward the snowman, giggling as Coco playfully knocked it over.

She scooped up the large snowball, stood on her tiptoes, and carefully placed the "head" back on. Coco wagged his tail excitedly, circling around her before rolling at her feet.

"Coco, aren't you cold?" She laughed. "I should knit you a sweater!"

"Woof!"

Coco seemed to understand, his tail wagging furiously. He leaped at Mari, licking her cheeks with unrestrained joy.

"Ahaha! That tickles! Stop it, Coco!"

Mari tumbled into the snow, laughing as the dog playfully wrestled with her.

Jareth watched the scene, warmth flooding his chest. His gaze softened with affection.

He had never imagined he could experience such simple happiness.

But Mari had given him that.

She had given him everything other men took for granted.

"Mr. Jareth," Lily approached with a smile. "I never thought Coco, who used to bite strangers, would get along so well with Ms. Mari."

Jareth smirked. "Because he's smitten."

Lily muttered under her breath, "Dogs really do take after their owners."

Jareth's eyes darkened as he watched Coco nuzzle against Mari. A strange ache twisted inside him.

Was he… jealous of a dog?

"Coco! Go cool off somewhere else!"

He strode forward, pulling Mari to her feet. Snow clung to her clothes, and he brushed it off carefully.

"It's cold on the ground. You'll catch a chill."

"Thank you, Jareth."

"Don't mention it."

His fingers lingered on her arms, his breath warm against her flushed skin. "Mari, you mean everything to me. I should be thanking you."

"But… I didn't do anything."

"You did more than you know."

He took her freezing hands between his, rubbing warmth back into them before pressing them to his lips.

"Come here."

He opened his coat, and she nestled into his embrace without hesitation.

The scent of him—warm, masculine, safe—wrapped around her. She closed her eyes, sinking deeper into his hold.

Jareth's pulse quickened. His grip tightened.

"Mari."

"Hmm?"

"From now on, you only act like this with me." His voice was rough, possessive. "If I see you like this with anyone else, I'll lose control."

Her breath hitched. "How… how scary would that be?"

His lips hovered dangerously close to hers. "Very. Want to find out?"

She shook her head rapidly, heart pounding.

"Then remember. Only me."

These past days, Jareth had spoiled her rotten—buying her beautiful clothes, feeding her delicacies, drying her hair, even sharing his bed (though nothing more).

She didn’t want to anger him. Not when he treated her so kindly.

"Good girl."

Her wide, innocent eyes sparkled, and Jareth nearly kissed her right then.

A sudden realization struck him like ice water.

What am I doing?

But the thought of her marrying someone else—being held, kissed, carrying another man’s child—made his chest tighten painfully.

"Mr. Jareth!" Lily’s urgent voice snapped him back.

He turned. "What is it?"

Lily glanced at Mari, lowering her voice. "Gordon just called. Mr. Thaddeus’s condition has worsened."

Jareth stiffened. "What?"

Mari looked over in confusion.

"Gordon didn’t give details. Thaddeus is recovering at his private villa and hasn’t told anyone. Gordon asked you to come immediately."

"Prepare the car. Now."

Not wanting to worry Mari, Jareth simply told her he had urgent business and might not return tonight.

"I'll wait for you," she said softly at the door, eyes brimming with reluctance.

His heart clenched. He gave her a reassuring smile before turning to the maid. "Take care of her."

As Jareth’s car disappeared, three luxury vehicles pulled up to the villa—escorts meant for Edith’s return to the Fairhaven estate.

"Miss Edith, we’re here," Manny said quietly.

Edith glared at the lavish villa, trembling with rage. "All for that little tramp. My brother is insane."

"Please calm down. Mr. Jareth has never been serious about any woman. This infatuation will pass."

"You don’t understand! This time is different!" Edith’s face flushed crimson. "He’s obsessed with that idiot! He’d even taint our bloodline with her!"

Manny stayed silent.

"I won’t let her become my sister-in-law. It’s her or me!"

Edith stormed out, ordering Manny to keep spying on Jareth.

"Of course, Miss Edith."

Edith marched to the villa with her guards and secretary in tow.

Be rushed out, paling at the sight of her. "Miss Edith! Mr. Jareth isn’t here—"

"Then where’s that shameless Mari?"

"Mr. Jareth gave strict orders—"

"Break the door down!"

The guards forced their way in, restraining Be.

Edith barged into the living room, murder in her eyes.

Mari sat curled on the sofa, watching cartoons with Coco. At the sudden intrusion, she froze, then instinctively covered her head.

"Don’t hit me!"

"You dare seduce my brother? I’ll kill you!"

Edith yanked Mari’s hair, slapping her hard.

Mari whimpered, her barely healed injuries flaring with fresh pain.

"Drag her out! This is my house!"

The secretary grabbed Mari’s arm—until Coco lunged, sinking teeth into her.

"Ahh! Let go!"

"Don’t hurt him!" Mari shielded Coco with her body.

Edith seized the chance to kick her—

"Edith."

A voice like frozen steel sliced through the room.

Edith’s blood ran cold.

Jareth stood in the doorway, fury radiating off him in waves. His eyes burned with hellfire.

Mari, still trembling, hadn’t noticed his return.

The secretary nearly fainted from terror.

"Did you hit Mari?" Jareth advanced, each step deliberate.

Edith shivered. She’d never seen him like this.

But she was his sister. Family came first—always.

"Yes! And you deserve this! You abandoned me for her!"

Before she could finish—

SLAP!

The sound echoed through the villa.

Edith’s head snapped to the side, her cheek flaming red.

Lily, who had just entered, gasped.

Jareth had never struck his sister.

"Edith," he said coldly, pulling Mari protectively against him, "I’m starting to wonder if the cruel woman before me is truly my sister—or if I’ve spoiled a monster."
###Chapter 299

The world around Evelyn shattered. Her porcelain face drained of color, as if struck by lightning.

"Nathaniel, what are you saying? Are you cutting me off as your sister?"

Nathaniel ignored her, his focus solely on Isabella in his arms. His large hand stroked her trembling back in slow, soothing circles.

"Don't be afraid. I'm here now. No one will hurt you again."

But Isabella wasn't as pliant as before. She recoiled like a frightened hedgehog, her rapid breaths laced with defiance. "No, you're not my brother. You're Evelyn's brother."

Her delicate hands shoved against his solid chest, each push a dagger to his heart. "Let me go. I want to go home. I want Grandpa. I want to go home!"

"Isabella, don't be afraid—" Nathaniel's eyes burned crimson, but his voice remained tender.

"Let me go!"

No matter how much Isabella screamed, Nathaniel refused to loosen his grip. Instead, he pulled her closer, his fingers digging into the soft fabric of her white dress.

His lips brushed her ear, voice rough yet intimate. "You're right. I'm not your brother." A pause. "I'm your man, Isabella."

Evelyn's breath hitched. The woman she'd bullied for years—the one she thought would always be beneath her—was now cherished by her own brother.

It felt like her heart had been hollowed out.

This pain was worse than when she'd learned of Thaddeus's love for Evangeline. A hundred times worse.

Nathaniel had always been her shield, her protector. She'd taken his indulgence for granted, believing she could always be reckless under his care.

Now, she was losing that privilege.

He was giving it all to Isabella.

"Your man?" Isabella lifted her tear-streaked face, confusion swimming in her glassy eyes.

"Yes. I'm yours." Nathaniel's voice was gravel, his gaze molten.

Crack.

Evelyn's perfect life, like a fragile crystal, splintered before her.

From the shadows, Olivia watched, lips curling in satisfaction.

Isabella, overwhelmed by trauma and exhaustion, collapsed in Nathaniel's arms.

He carried her to their room, wiping away her sweat and tears with a soft towel before tucking her beneath the covers.

She stirred, brows furrowed in discomfort.

Nathaniel's jaw clenched. Guilt and fury warred inside him.

"I'm sorry, Isabella. I failed you."

Olivia stepped forward hesitantly.

"Speak," Nathaniel ordered, his touch gentle on Isabella's cheek but his tone icy.

"I have the surveillance footage you requested."

She handed him her phone.

Nathaniel had installed cameras throughout the estate—every corner covered. His phone could access them remotely.

The screen showed Evelyn's arrival, her orders to restrain Bella, her violent outburst—even the kick she'd delivered to Isabella.

Silence stretched.

"Mr. Nathaniel—"

Before Olivia could finish, Nathaniel hurled the phone across the room. It shattered against the wall.

"Mr. Nathaniel, please—" Olivia retreated, bowing.

But Nathaniel was already storming out, rage radiating off him.

Downstairs, Evelyn sat stiffly on the couch, flanked by four guards.

"Miss Evelyn, what do we do?" Her secretary clung to her legs, trembling.

"How should I know?"

Footsteps echoed.

Nathaniel entered, Olivia trailing behind. The air turned arctic.

"Nathaniel," Evelyn whispered, forcing innocence into her voice.

"You hit her. You kicked her. I saw everything." Nathaniel's voice was dangerously calm.

If it had been anyone else, he wouldn't have hesitated.

"I—I wasn't myself! You know I've never hurt anyone before!" Evelyn's face flushed.

Nathaniel remained unmoved.

"It was her!" Evelyn's gaze darted to her secretary. "She provoked me! She's the reason I lost control!"

The secretary paled. "No! I didn't—"

"Why do you hate Isabella?" Nathaniel's voice was low, lethal.

Evelyn swallowed. "She's a fool, yet she seduced you! How could I accept her as my sister-in-law?"

"Sister-in-law?" Nathaniel smirked, colder than his anger. "Since when do I need your approval?"

Evelyn's blood ran cold.

"You're mistaken about one thing." Nathaniel's gaze darkened, remembering Isabella's lips, her laughter. "She didn't seduce me. I pursued her."

Evelyn's world tilted.

The girl she'd scorned was rising above her.

"Olivia."

"Yes, Mr. Nathaniel."

"Break her arms and legs. Send her to Blackwood Asylum."

The secretary screamed.

Blackwood Asylum was hell on earth. Men became slaves. Women became worse.

"Mr. Nathaniel! It wasn't me! It was Miss Evelyn!"

Her pleas fell on deaf ears. Olivia signaled the guards, who dragged her out like trash.

Evelyn sat frozen, witnessing her brother's ruthlessness firsthand.

"You, Mother, and a select few knew about this estate." Nathaniel lit a cigarette, exhaling smoke. "Who told you Isabella was here?"

Evelyn trembled, sweat soaking her fur coat.

Nathaniel's smile was chilling. "No matter. I already know."

Two guards dragged in Manny, barely conscious, leaving a trail of blood.

Evelyn gagged.

"Manny, I saved your life ten years ago." Nathaniel leaned back in his chair. "This is how you repay me?"

"Miss Evelyn, help me!" Manny rasped.

Evelyn turned away, nauseated.

"Olivia. The usual."

Olivia approached Manny, gripped his chin, and—

A wet, sickening sound followed.

Manny's tongue hit the floor.

Evelyn shrieked, clutching her chest before fainting.

Three nights passed.

Evangeline couldn't sleep.

Nightmares of Thaddeus haunted her. That pool of blood at the Averys' doorstep gnawed at her.

"Evangeline, your medicine."

Suri entered, placing a vial on the desk.

Evangeline paused her packing. "Thank you."

"Anything for you." Suri smoothed her hair. "How's Thaddeus's injury?"

"You care?"

"Of course not!" Suri scoffed. "I'm just monitoring our drug's efficacy."

Evangeline's chest tightened.

The drug was experimental. She'd risked using it to save Thaddeus.

"He's stable. But are there side effects?"

Suri sighed. "Two things: no physical strain, and no emotional extremes. Anger could worsen his condition."

Evangeline's breath hitched.

That bloodstain flashed in her mind again.
###Chapter 300

Isabella and Nathan finished packing, preparing to return to Windsor Estates with the medicine Seraphina had provided.

"Darling, must you leave so soon? Stay for dinner—it's nearly ready." Margaret, tying her apron strings, hurried toward them.

"Another time, Margaret. I really must get back."

Isabella stepped closer, cupping Margaret's flour-dusted face between her hands, studying her intently. "Your birthday is just around the corner. Take a few days off, forget about work. You should be indulging yourself, darling. You deserve to be the most radiant birthday queen this weekend."

"Oh, birthdays." Margaret sighed, shoulders slumping. "The thought of hosting all those people exhausts me before it even begins. I'm only doing this to humor your father."

"It's not about humoring him. It's about you—about all of us celebrating you."

Isabella's striking eyes flashed with playful reproach. "Listen to me: no more overworking. I have eyes everywhere in this house. If I hear you’ve been pushing yourself too hard, I’ll show up at your party empty-handed and just raid the buffet. Understood?" Nathan chuckled beside her, amused by Isabella’s faux-stern expression—the way her nose scrunched and her lips pursed was utterly endearing.

Margaret’s delicate features softened into a smile as she pinched Isabella’s cheek affectionately. "What gift could ever compare to having this family?"

An orphan raised in a group home, Margaret had stumbled into the entertainment industry after a talent scout spotted her in a local theater troupe. Unlike Arabella’s noble lineage or Victoria’s influential father, she had always felt unworthy—of Reginald, of this life.

Isabella’s throat tightened.

For a fleeting moment, she envied her father’s ability to surround himself with loyal men.

Good women were plentiful. Good men? Rare as diamonds. The thought of filling the family with unworthy suitors was too grim to entertain.

"Isabella."

A deep, melodic voice cut through her thoughts.

She turned to see Sebastian descending the grand staircase, clad in his priestly robes, a leather-bound Bible in hand.

"Sebastian."

"Don’t rush off. There’s something I need to discuss with you."

In the sunlit parlor, Sebastian prepared tea with practiced grace, the fragrant steam curling between them. Isabella rested her chin on her palm, watching him—every movement precise, every gesture regal.

What woman could ever deserve him? The question haunted her.

"Isabella," he began, sliding a delicate cup toward her, "are you truly interested in Adrian?"

She nearly dropped her tea. "What?"

"I’m serious."

"No. Absolutely. Not." Each word was punctuated with a firm shake of her head.

"Then you should distance yourself from him." Sebastian took a measured sip.

"He’s the one seeking me out. I’m not encouraging him."

"Yet you neither reject nor discourage him. Are you toying with him?" His tone was gentle but probing.

Isabella’s fair skin flushed. "Sebastian! Since when do you accuse your own sister of such things?"

"If you don’t care for him, make it clear. You’re giving him hope—and Adrian is far more calculating than he appears. Like an iceberg, only a fraction is visible." His voice lowered. "He vanished for fifteen years, only to return from Geneva and suddenly attach himself to you. You’re the Sinclair heiress. The entire K Group will be yours. You could have any man in the country. I don’t believe his intentions are pure."

A pause. Then, bluntly: "In my eyes, Adrian is worse than Alexander."

Her grip on the cup tightened.

"At least Alexander loves without deception. He wears his flaws openly."

"Oh, yes. He loved Valentina so deeply he enlisted to die after she left him." Bitterness laced her words as she slammed the cup down, eyes glistening.

"And yet," Sebastian countered softly, "he nearly died for you. His injuries still haven’t fully healed. Who knows what lasting damage remains?"

Her chest constricted. "That’s different."

"Loving Alexander wasn’t a mistake. He never lied to you. His flaws were always visible. That’s cruelty, yes—but also honesty." He leaned forward, clasping her chilled hands. "The one who loves you may be flawed, but they should never deceive you."

Her lashes fluttered down, shadowing her troubled gaze.

After farewells, Isabella and Nathan set off for Windsor Estates.

Just before the highway exit, she murmured, "Take me to Kingsley Manor."

Nathan’s brow furrowed, but he complied without question.

At the estate gates, Isabella bypassed Alexander entirely, dialing Evelyn instead.

"Mrs. Kingsley, forgive the intrusion, but Alexander hasn’t been home in days." Evelyn’s voice trembled. "He barely answers my calls, and when he does, he sounds—broken. He insists he’s fine, but—"

Isabella’s heart clenched as if gripped by an invisible fist.

"I’ve raised that boy since he was in diapers. He bottles everything up. Even as a child, he’d suffer in silence. Please, Mrs. Kingsley, find him. I fear the worst."

"Evelyn, breathe. I’ll bring him home."

Alexander might hide from the world.

But he would never hide from her.

Ending the call, she hesitated, then dialed Lawrence.

"Mr. Grant."

"Ms. Sinclair?" His usual warmth was strained.

She didn’t believe his cheerful facade for a second.

"Where is Alexander? If he’s not home, where is he hiding?" Her tone sharpened.

"He’s—away on business."

"Lawrence," she warned, voice like steel, "lie to me, and the consequences will be severe."

A ragged breath. Then, hoarse: "Mrs. Kingsley, I’d rather lose my job than lie. Please—he’s in no state to be alone. I’m terrified he’ll—" His voice cracked. "Hurry."
###Chapter 301

The sprawling villa in the countryside was quiet, save for the occasional rustle of leaves outside.

Inside, Alexander Kingsley lay in bed, his body weakened from the first round of medication. The last dose had just been taken, and though he knew Isabella Sinclair would send more, he doubted it was out of lingering affection.

She didn’t want to owe him anything.

Earlier, he had felt fine—just a dull ache in his chest. But as night fell, a fever struck without warning.

"Daniel?" His voice was hoarse, his skin burning one moment, icy the next. His eyelids felt heavy.

No answer.

Right. He’d sent Daniel to the office for urgent documents. The man was probably still speeding back.

Gritting his teeth, Alexander pushed himself up. The sheets clung to him, drenched in sweat. His hair stuck to his forehead, his entire body damp as if he’d been pulled from the ocean.

He changed into fresh pajamas, his legs unsteady as he descended the stairs for water.

Then—the doorbell rang.

Frowning, he shuffled to the intercom and flicked it on.

The screen lit up with Isabella’s face, breathtaking even through the grainy feed. His pulse spiked.

"Alexander, I know you’re there. Open the door." Her voice was sharp, her gaze piercing.

He pressed his lips together, silent.

"Are you dead or just pretending? Open up."

Her irritation was palpable, one hand on her hip. "If you’ve got a will, write it now. If not, I’m coming in to collect your corpse."

The words startled a cough out of him.

"Don’t think you’re the only one who can play games. I can too."

She pounded on the door. "If you don’t come out, I’m not leaving."

Before she could finish, the door swung open.

Alexander stood there, clad in deep blue pajamas, pale but still devastatingly handsome. A faint, tired smile curved his lips. "Ms. Sinclair, it’s cold outside. Come in."

He couldn’t bear to see her shivering.

Isabella’s breath hitched. He looked thinner, his complexion ashen.

Had he even been taking his medicine? He’d seemed better days ago. What happened?

Biting her lip, she stepped inside.

Alexander led her to the living room, every movement strained.

"How did you find me? Did Daniel tell you?"

"Don’t blame him. He did it for your own good."

She sat on the sofa, her expression cool. "You barely have anyone reliable left. If you fire him over this, you’re a fool. I’ll hire him myself if that happens—then don’t you dare cry about it."

"Ms. Sinclair, you’re overthinking." His dry lips twitched into a smile despite himself. "Daniel’s been with me for years. I wouldn’t let him leave."

He just didn’t want her to worry.

But then he remembered—that night, standing beside Nathaniel, she had looked at him with nothing but disgust.

He didn’t have the courage to say those words anymore.

"Why do you keep calling me Ms. Sinclair? It’s so formal. Why not just Isabella, like before?"

"Because I know you don’t like it."

Her eyes widened slightly, an odd ache blooming in her chest.

"In the past, I was wrong. I pushed you too hard. From now on, I won’t do anything to make you uncomfortable."

The sight of him—fragile, broken—made her chest tighten.

Clearing her throat, she grabbed the medicine bottle from the table and stood. "Second course. Take it on time. I’m leaving."

"You don’t have to. Take it back."

"Alexander, what do you mean? Don’t you want to live anymore?" Her frown deepened. "You, a billionaire tycoon, can you really just give up?"

"No. I just don’t want you to feel obligated. Even if I saved you, it was repayment. Atonement."

He shook his head. "Whatever happens to me, don’t feel guilty. Besides, I’m better now. I don’t need the medicine."

"Better? Who are you trying to fool?"

She scoffed. "What’s this new tactic? I’m not soft-hearted enough to fall for it."

"I know." His smile was bitter. "That’s why there’s no strategy in my words. Only truth. I really don’t need it."

Her heart twisted. "Fine. If you don’t want my concern, I won’t waste my time. I’m not that desperate. After this, no more medication. Too much can harm you. Take care of yourself."

She turned to leave—but his hand caught her wrist.

"You’re already here. It’s cold outside. At least have some tea before you go. I’ll make it quick."

For reasons she couldn’t explain, she didn’t refuse.

She sat back down, watching his tall frame disappear into the kitchen.

Her mind drifted to Sebastian’s words.

In terms of sincerity, you and Alexander are the same. Once you love someone, you’d do anything—even lay your heart bare.

Too bad she’d already loved him once, and he’d thrown it away. Opening her heart again? Impossible.

Then—a crash.

The sound of shattering porcelain.

"Alexander?!"

Her heart lurched. She bolted to the kitchen.

Broken shards littered the marble floor.

Alexander knelt among them, one hand braced on the ground, the other gripping the counter. His clothes were soaked with sweat, his breaths ragged.

"What’s wrong with you?!"

Her face paled as she rushed forward, trying to pull him up. But his weakened body was too heavy.

Cursing, she dropped to her knees, clearing the sharp fragments away before he collapsed onto them.

"Isabella..."

His voice was weak, his cheeks flushed with fever. His eyes were unfocused.

Her fingers brushed his forehead—burning.

"How did this happen?! Did you even take your medicine, you idiot?!"

His breath was scorching against her skin. With the last of his strength, he pulled her into his arms.

"Isabella... please. Just a little love. That’s all I’m asking for."

Her lips parted in shock.

"Alexander—"

"I want you to love me." His whisper was raw, desperate. "But I know... I don’t deserve it."
###Chapter 302

The heat of Nathaniel's breath scorched Isabella's neck like a brand, each exhale sending shivers down her spine.

Her porcelain skin flushed where his lips had nearly brushed against it.

"Nathaniel! Have you lost your mind? What the hell are you saying? Nathaniel!"

Sweat drenched his thin pajamas, the damp fabric clinging to both of them.

Fever raged through him, his body trembling as if it were being torn apart from the inside.

All he could think was to hold onto her—the woman he loved. No matter how desperate, how undignified it made him, he couldn't let go.

"Isabella, don't leave me. Don't hate me."

His face pressed into her shoulder, his voice breaking like shattered glass.

She couldn’t tell if the wetness on her skin was sweat or tears.

A sharp ache twisted through her chest, spreading like wildfire through her veins.

Nathaniel, you were never this vulnerable with me before. When I was on my knees, begging you not to walk away, you tossed those divorce papers at me like I was nothing. You were untouchable, cold as stone.

Her lips trembled as she watched him, her eyes burning. "Nathaniel, are you delirious? What kind of nonsense is this?"

"It's not nonsense." His voice was hoarse but firm. "It's the truth."

Beads of sweat rolled down his sharp jawline as he shook his head stubbornly. "Isabella, I love you."

Her breath hitched.

She kept her expression composed, but the tips of her ears burned red.

With the last of his strength, he lifted his hand, fingers brushing her cheek.

His gaze was fever-bright, filled with a longing so deep it made her chest ache.

"Isabella, I know what I'm saying. I love you. Only you."

Then his eyes fluttered shut, and his full weight collapsed onto her.

"Ugh, damn it! Why now? You're crushing me!"

Panic and irritation warred inside her as she clenched her fists, tempted to shove him off.

But the memory of his injuries stopped her. Instead, she sighed, her hand resting gently on his damp back.

I should have known better. Nathaniel, loving you is agony. Maybe it's better if we just let go.

Olivia and Sebastian arrived at the villa at the same time.

Though Sebastian could be impulsive, he was still the Chief Secretary of the Vanderbilt Group—he knew how to read a room. And the look on Mr. Olivia's face? Dangerous.

"Mr. Sebastian, how is he?" Olivia demanded, his voice tight.

"He vomited blood twice. The fever won't break."

Sebastian's chest ached remembering Nathaniel's suffering the night before. He'd give anything to take his place.

"How the hell did this happen?" Olivia's knuckles whitened, his eyes bloodshot.

"I've informed Mrs. Vanderbilt. He's been taking the medicine she prescribed, and he's stabilized. She'll know what to do."

Sebastian had no other options. His only hope was Isabella.

Just then, Olivia spotted the sleek Bugatti parked outside—Isabella's car.

A slow smirk curved his lips. "Wait. Let's not go in yet."

Sebastian blinked. "What?"

"They never get time alone. Let them have this."

If he didn't help his friend now, what kind of friend was he?

Dragging Nathaniel's six-foot-three frame back to the bedroom was like hauling a boulder uphill.

Thankfully, the villa had an elevator. By the time Isabella wrestled him onto the bed, her dress was soaked through with sweat.

"You're impossible. I should leave you on the floor."

Exhausted, she still didn't rest. She rushed to the bathroom, soaked a towel in cold water, and pressed it to his burning skin.

Finally, she sank onto the edge of the bed, breathless.

"Look at you. Causing trouble even when you're unconscious. Do you have any idea how difficult you are?"

Her tone was sharp, but her chest tightened with guilt.

This was her fault.

"Isabella..." Nathaniel murmured in his sleep, his lashes fluttering. Even delirious, he called for her.

"Stop whining. I'm right here."

She huffed, crossing her arms. "If I'd known it would be this much trouble, I'd have sent Daniel instead. Then I wouldn't have to deal with you."

She started to stand—

Nathaniel's hand shot out, gripping her wrist.

Her eyes widened. "You're awake? Or were you faking this whole time?"

"I never lied to you."

His breathing was ragged, but his hold was ironclad. "I heard you leaving in my dream. I couldn't let you go. Stay. Just for a little while."

His usually icy eyes were soft, brimming with warmth—only for her.

Her pulse stuttered like a trapped bird.

"I've already called Sebastian. The medicine is here. You're in bed. My job is done."

Her voice was firm. "We're divorced, Mr. Vanderbilt. Don't make this harder than it has to be."

But as she tried to pull away, Nathaniel yanked her down—

"Isabella!"

A dizzying rush of motion, and suddenly she was beneath him.

He braced himself above her, careful not to crush her, his muscles taut under his shirt.

Their breaths tangled, hot and uneven.

Her heart hammered as she stared up at him—his gaze dark, intense, like he was memorizing every inch of her.

"You said you wouldn't force me."

Her cheeks burned, her entire body tingling.

A drop of his sweat landed on her skin, searing like a brand. "You're contradicting yourself. Is this a game to you?"

"Who told you to show up when I'm like this?"

His lips curved, desire burning in his eyes as he held her tighter. "Ms. Sinclair, are you trying to kill me?"

She opened her mouth to argue—

He didn't let her.

His fingers tilted her chin up, and his mouth crashed down on hers.

Downstairs, Olivia and Sebastian waited awkwardly.

Sebastian paced, glancing up the staircase every few seconds.

Olivia, meanwhile, sat stiffly on the couch, his phone in hand, watching the same clip over and over—

Mari, cowering as Edith advanced on her.

The more he watched, the tighter his grip became.

"Mr. Olivia, what are you watching so intently?" Sebastian ventured.

Olivia's icy glare shut him up instantly.

As he replayed the footage, he noticed something—

Mari's reaction wasn't just fear. It was instinct.

Her arms wrapped around her head, her body curling in on itself like she was used to blows.

His stomach twisted.

Has she been abused before?

The thought made his blood boil.

"Since when were you two here? How did I not notice?"

Isabella's voice startled them as she descended the stairs, her breathing slightly uneven.

Olivia quickly tucked his phone away, smirking. "Didn't want to interrupt. You two finally had some alone time—we figured we'd stay out of it."

"Alone time?" Her eyes flashed. "You're unbelievable."

Olivia leaned back, studying her—the flush on her cheeks, the slight swell of her lips.

His grin widened.

Well, well. Nathaniel, you sly devil.

"Mrs. Vanderbilt! You're here! Mr. Nathaniel is saved!" Sebastian nearly wept with relief.

Isabella didn't correct the title. "Mr. Sebastian, his fever is from internal injuries resurfacing. It's serious. I've arranged for specialists from Sinclair Medical to see him. Prepare to take him there."

Sebastian bowed deeply. "Thank you, Mrs. Vanderbilt! I knew you still cared!"

"Whether I care or not doesn't mean I want to see him suffer. Don't twist my words."

Her tone was sharp, refusing to indulge his hopeful narrative.

She turned to Olivia, her gaze piercing.

He met it, an odd pressure settling in his chest.

"Mr. Olivia. We need to talk."
###Chapter 303

The sleek black car door shut with a soft click as Evadne settled into the plush leather seat beside Jareth.

"You actually want to be alone with me?" Jareth's lips curled into that infuriatingly charming smirk, his dark eyes glinting with amusement. "Color me surprised. Though I should warn you—if Thaddeus finds out we're having this little chat, he might just combust on the spot. The man's already on the verge of a breakdown as it is."

Evadne crossed her arms, her expression as frosty as the winter wind outside. "If it weren't for Mari, I wouldn’t be caught dead sharing the same oxygen as you." She tilted her head, her gaze sharp. "So, tell me, Jareth—have you finally grown bored of your usual playthings and set your sights on someone pure? Someone like Mari?"

At the mention of her name, Jareth's fingers twitched against the steering wheel. His voice dropped, rougher than usual. "You already know how I feel about her."

"Do I?" Evadne arched a brow, her smile razor-thin. "Enlighten me."

Jareth exhaled sharply, his grip tightening. "I'm in love with her."

Evadne laughed—cold, mocking. "And how many times have you said that this year alone?"

"This is different." His jaw clenched. "She is different."

"Oh, I'm sure." Evadne's tone dripped with disdain. "Mari is just another conquest to you. A shiny new toy. Once the novelty wears off, you'll toss her aside like all the others."

Jareth's knuckles whitened. "You think I'd dare treat her like that?"

"I think you're incapable of anything else."

For the first time, Jareth's composure cracked. His voice was raw, stripped bare. "Evadne, I swear on my life—I love her. More than I've ever loved anyone."

Evadne studied him, her gaze unreadable. Then, quietly: "What if your family disowns you for it? What if they cut you off from Fairhaven entirely? Would you still choose her?"

Jareth didn't hesitate. "Yes."

Evadne's lips pressed into a thin line. "Words are cheap, Jareth. If you truly care about her, you'll marry her. Otherwise, you're just setting her up for heartbreak."

Marry her.

The words hung between them, heavy as a guillotine.

Jareth's breath hitched.

Evadne smirked, cold triumph in her eyes. "What's wrong? Suddenly speechless? Or is Mari Abernathy not worthy of being your wife? Just good enough to be your dirty little secret?"

Jareth's temper snapped. "Evadne—!"

But she was already done. "Think about what I said. Mari's suffered enough. She doesn't need you making it worse."

Later, Jareth returned to the villa—their villa, the one he shared with Mari.

The moment he stepped inside, Lily rushed to him, worry etched into her features. "Ms. Glynnis hasn't slept. She's still in shock."

Jareth's chest tightened. He took the stairs two at a time.

The bedroom was dim, lit only by a single lamp. Mari sat curled on the bed, her face buried in her knees.

Jareth approached slowly, sinking onto the mattress beside her. "Mari?"

She didn't look up.

Gently, he brushed his fingers through her hair. "Does it still hurt?"

A small shake of her head.

"Then let's sleep, yeah?"

Mari finally lifted her face—her eyes red-rimmed, cheeks streaked with tears. "I want to be alone."

Jareth's heart cracked. "Alright. I'll go."

But as he stood, her hand shot out, gripping his sleeve. "Don't." Her voice was barely a whisper. "Don't leave me."

Jareth exhaled sharply, gathering her into his arms. She clung to him, trembling.

"Hold me tighter," she whispered.

He did.

Mari buried her face in his chest. "Jareth... I need you."

His pulse roared in his ears.

She tilted her head up, her lips parted—innocent, trusting.

Jareth's restraint shattered.

He kissed her—hard, desperate.

Mari gasped, but she didn't pull away.

When they broke apart, Jareth's voice was rough. "Mari... tell me you want this."

She blinked up at him, her fingers tangling in his shirt. "I don't know what this is. But... I want you."

Jareth groaned, pressing his forehead to hers. "God, you'll be the death of me."

Mari smiled—small, shy. "Then die happy."

And just like that, Jareth was lost.
###Chapter 304

Jareth's explosive fury left Edith deeply shaken.

Before her eyes, Jareth's secretary and Manny faced brutal punishment. Manny, who had served Jareth for years, had his tongue cut out. From the look of him, he wouldn't last much longer.

All because of some girl named Mari.

Was Jareth really going this far for a fool? What was she, his own sister, compared to that? It felt like a cruel joke!

Leaving the villa, Edith returned to the Fairhaven mansion, her face twisted with resentment.

On the drive back, memories of Jareth's past affection for her flooded her mind. The more she thought about it, the angrier she became, crying the entire way. By the time she arrived, she had made a decision.

No matter what it took, she would tear Jareth and Mari apart. She refused to let some dimwitted, lowborn girl become her sister-in-law.

"Edith! You're finally home!"

Mrs. Fairhaven, Jareth's mother, rushed to embrace her daughter, eyes brimming with tears. "Darling, your flight landed hours ago! Why are you only just arriving? I've been worried sick!"

"Mother." Edith's eyes reddened at the sight of her, humiliation still fresh in her mind.

"What's wrong, sweetheart? You look upset. Did someone hurt you?"

Mrs. Fairhaven cupped her daughter's face. "Where's Jareth? Didn’t he pick you up? Why isn’t he with you?"

Edith lowered her head, shaking it sadly.

"Jareth! He used to dote on you endlessly. Now he's neglecting you for that Abernathy girl, shipping you off to Aetheria without a second thought. He couldn’t even be bothered to greet his own sister when she returned! What is wrong with him?"

Mrs. Fairhaven stroked Edith's cold cheeks. "Jareth hasn’t been home in days! I know he’s busy, but he’s never been this distant before. He’s avoiding us—ignoring his own sister! I don’t understand what’s gotten into him!"

"I know why Jareth hasn’t come home."

"What?" Mrs. Fairhaven froze.

Edith clenched her fists, voice trembling. "Mother, I have to tell you something. But promise me you won’t lose your temper, okay?"

"What is it, Edith? You’re scaring me!"

"Jareth is dating Elspeth’s daughter." Edith spat the words out like poison.

"Who? Elspeth? That wretched woman’s child?" Mrs. Fairhaven recoiled, stunned.

"Yes! Glynnis’s younger sister—Elspeth’s daughter!"

Edith gripped her mother’s arm, shaking it. "Mother! What is Jareth thinking? Elspeth and her daughter humiliated us, accused us of crimes, nearly sent me to prison! And now Jareth is tangled up with Glynnis’s sister? How could he betray me like this? He doesn’t care about me anymore!"

Mrs. Fairhaven’s face darkened. Her son was her pride—brilliant, powerful, unmatched. She knew the Abernathy family was influential, and Jareth had always been close with Thaddeus.

But she forced herself to stay calm. "Edith, I despise Elspeth’s daughter too. But you know your brother. He enjoys mingling with noblewomen, yet he’s never brought one home. He’s never been serious about anyone. This infatuation with Elspeth’s daughter will pass, just like all the others."

"No! It’s different this time!"

Edith’s eyes burned with fury. "Jareth hasn’t come home because he’s living with Mari! He bought her a house—like she’s his secret mistress!"

Mrs. Fairhaven staggered as if struck by lightning.

"I hate Elspeth and her daughter. I refuse to let Mari become my sister-in-law. But Jareth is obsessed! He even lashed out at me—because of her!" Edith let her words hang, baiting her mother’s anger.

"What else happened?"

"He hit me!" Tears streamed down her face.

"He struck you? Where?"

"My face! Right in front of Mari and the servants! Mother, it still hurts!" Edith buried her face in her mother’s chest, sobbing uncontrollably.

Mrs. Fairhaven’s heart ached. Her precious daughter, her little princess. Her son—always dutiful, always respectful—had raised a hand against his own sister over that wretched girl?

What next? Would he disown his own mother?

"Mother! You can’t let Jareth marry Mari! If he does, our family’s reputation will be ruined! Jareth will become a laughingstock in Fairhaven Group!" Edith’s voice was raw with desperation.

"What do you mean?"

"Mari is mentally challenged! She’s autistic!"

Mrs. Fairhaven’s world shattered.

Her son—brilliant, accomplished, worthy of an Ashbourne heiress—marrying a dimwit? Never.

"Mother, even if Mari is the Abernathy heiress, aren’t you afraid your future grandson might inherit her condition? What if it’s hereditary?"

Edith’s words struck like a dagger.

"Edith, thank goodness you told me. Now I know what we’re dealing with."

Mrs. Fairhaven’s gentle eyes turned icy. "Don’t worry. I won’t let my son throw his life away on some disgraceful woman."

Hidden in her mother’s arms, Edith smirked.

Days passed. The joint birthday celebrations for the Ashbourne and Abernathy ladies loomed closer.

Elspeth, though chastened by Frederic’s disapproval, still discreetly sent invitations to Elmsworth’s elite. She might have lost some standing, but she remained the Abernathy Group chairman’s wife. She refused to let Myra, the mistress, outshine her.

The Ashbournes, meanwhile, kept Myra’s celebration quiet. Wealthy matrons didn’t need publicity.

The night before the party, Myra was blindfolded and led into a room by Evadne and the other ladies.

"What’s all this secrecy?" Myra laughed.

"Three! Two! One!"

Evadne removed the blindfold.

Myra blinked, then gasped.

Under dazzling lights stood a mannequin wearing a breathtaking black-and-red evening gown, its sequins shimmering like stars.

"It’s stunning!"

"Myra, this is your dress—custom-designed by Haron, just for you!" Suri wrapped an arm around her, awestruck. "God, I’ve seen Haron’s work in magazines, but in person? It’s even more beautiful!"

Evadne, secretly pleased, bit back a smile.

"Haron? Evadne, this is too extravagant!"

Myra clutched Evadne’s hand, cheeks pink. "You must have gone through so much trouble. You shouldn’t have!"

"Please. I’m an Ashbourne. If Haron refused me, she’d be finished in this industry." Evadne smirked, hands on her hips.

"Can you ask her to make me a biker jacket?" Aviana’s eyes sparkled. "I joined a motorcycle club. I need something stylish!"

Evadne and Suri exchanged glances.

Unbelievable. When would this nearly forty-year-old woman grow up?

"Suri, Aviana, don’t worry. When your birthdays come, I’ll have Haron design for you too."

Suri narrowed her eyes. "Haron’s notoriously reclusive. How do you keep getting her to work for you?"

She leaned in. "Evadne… is Haron another one of your aliases?"

Myra and Aviana whipped their heads toward her.

"What? No!" Evadne laughed awkwardly. "I’m already Alea. I can’t be Haron too. I’m not magic."

The three women chorused, "You’re more than capable."

Fair point.

"One more thing."

Evadne darted to the mannequin and pulled out a velvet box. "I’ll be busy tomorrow, so I’m giving you this now. Happy birthday!"

Tears welled as Myra opened it—an exquisite aquamarine ring, cool and elegant as the ocean.

"Thank you. I love it."

"I avoided precious stones so Emeric wouldn’t feel upstaged. Besides, this suits you." Evadne smiled. "As Alea, I match gems to personalities. The design’s worth surpasses the materials."

Suri and Aviana then showed their gifts, filling the room with laughter.

Evadne’s phone buzzed. She slipped into the hallway.

"Hello." Her voice was cool.

"Ms. Evadne, I’m feeling better. Thought I’d update you." Thaddeus’s deep voice was uncharacteristically warm. "Next time, call me directly. No need to go through Gordon."

Her pulse quickened.

"Or I’ll call you. Gladly."

"Unnecessary. I’m not your doctor." She hardened her tone. "You’re fine? Good. We’re done here."

"Last time—thank you. Without you, my fever wouldn’t have broken so fast." His chuckle was low, intimate. "You’re better than medicine."

"Thaddeus! Have you lost your mind?"

Flushing, she remembered his forced kiss and slammed a fist against the window. "Keep this up, and you’ll regret it!"

"How much more can I regret, Evadne?" His voice turned raw. "Divorcing you—that’s my lifetime regret."

"Serves you right. I’m hanging up."

"Wait!"

"What now?"

"Tomorrow… can I come to Myra’s party? Please?"

She scoffed. "Mr. Thaddeus, it’s an Ashbourne family event. Do you really have the nerve to face them?"

"I know. But sooner or later, I’ll have to meet my in-laws."

"Have you been eating humble pie?" She imagined punching his head.

"Can I, Evadne?"

She recalled Frederic beating him bloody over this. Reluctantly, she bit her lip. "Bring a gift."

His voice brightened. "Of course. I’d never come empty-handed."

"Get lost!"

The weekend arrived.
###Chapter 305

The grand birthday celebration for two high society ladies was finally here.

The night before, Seraphina couldn't sleep, her mind racing with visions of outshining everyone at the party. She chuckled to herself, imagining the looks on their faces.

She had even instructed her staff to compile clips from her acting career and some scandalous photos from her modeling days, planning to loop them at the party to impress the guests.

But the next morning, Seraphina looked like a wreck—bloodshot eyes, dark circles so deep they could touch the floor. Without makeup, she resembled a ghost from a horror flick.

Age was cruel. She used to stay flawless even after three sleepless nights of filming. Now, one restless night left her looking haggard. "Call my beautician! Emergency treatment! Now!" she shrieked, pacing the room in a frenzy.

In her rage, she shattered an expensive vase.

Her husband, Nathaniel, remained blissfully unaware of her tantrum.

The servants outside the door trembled before scrambling to make the call.

Seraphina glared at her reflection, fury burning inside her.

Tonight, she was sharing the spotlight with Vivienne—a silent competition.

Even though she hadn't seen Vivienne in years, and even though she now held the title of Nathaniel's wife, she was still nervous. Vivienne had once been the nation's sweetheart, every man's fantasy. Seraphina feared she wouldn't measure up.

"Mom! Mom!"

Amelia burst in, startled by Seraphina's appearance.

"What now? Stop making a scene!" Seraphina snapped.

"I just called Grandpa again. He still won’t be coming to your party."

"So what? I never expected that old man to show up anyway. His absence is a blessing—who wants his musty presence ruining the atmosphere?" Seraphina scoffed, not bothering to hide her disdain.

"But—but he also told me," Amelia swallowed hard, "he and Adrian are going to the Ashbourne family’s party instead."

"What?!" Seraphina's eyes blazed with fury.

"He said Chairman Reginald and Evadne video-called him last night. They had such a great chat that he decided to visit Reginald for old times' sake and share a drink."

"Damn it!"

Seraphina's chest heaved as she swept everything off her vanity.

"Mom! What do we do? If people find out Adrian and Grandpa are at the Ashbournes' instead of yours, it'll be humiliating!"

Amelia had been seething ever since Seraphina supported Cassandra and Harrison’s relationship. Now, she seized the chance to twist the knife. "They never accepted you as the true lady of the Kingsley family. They think attending your party would be beneath them!"

"Enough! Shut up!" Seraphina could barely breathe, her blood pressure skyrocketing.

"Mom! What’s the plan?" Amelia pretended to fret, though inwardly, she was gloating.

"It doesn’t matter. That old man is just trying to provoke me. If I let this ruin my night, I’d be playing right into his hands."

Seraphina sat on the couch, starting her breathing exercises. "One day, he’ll retire. My husband is his only son. Everything will be Nathaniel’s. I couldn’t care less about that old fool. I’ll outlive him."

At exactly six in the evening.

A line of sleek black luxury cars pulled up outside the mansion. Nathaniel and Seraphina, along with their two daughters, stepped into a limo flanked by bodyguards, heading toward the Kingsley Hotel in grand procession.

Nathaniel stared blankly out the window, indifferent even though it was his wife’s birthday.

The Kingsley sisters sat across from their parents. Cassandra, as usual, hunched over, clutching the teddy bear Evadne had given her—her only comfort. Amelia, dressed in an expensive Maison de Valois suit, sat beside her, treating her like a servant in front of Nathaniel.

"Oh, sweet Cassandra, it’s Mommy’s big day. Why didn’t you dress up?"

Amelia wore a saccharine smile, feigning concern. "Don’t you know how to style yourself? You should’ve told me. I could’ve helped."

Cassandra stayed silent.

"Remember that hairstyle I did for you last time? It looked so good. I could’ve done it again today." Amelia barely concealed her amusement.

Then—smack!

Cassandra shoved Amelia away with surprising force.

Nathaniel and Seraphina froze. They had never seen their younger daughter lose her temper before.

"Cassandra! That hurt! What’s wrong with you?" Amelia played the victim.

"I never asked for your help. You always force me."

Cassandra hugged her teddy bear, tears welling in her eyes. For once, she found the courage to stand up to her sister.

Nathaniel turned to Amelia, frowning.

"What did you just say?" Amelia’s eyes widened in shock.

"And I hate that crew cut. I hate it. Stop making me wear it, okay?" Cassandra gritted her teeth, each word dripping with resentment.

"Amelia, what is your sister talking about?" Nathaniel’s voice was stern.

"Oh, Dad, she’s not normal. You know she says nonsense all the time. I have no idea why she’s saying this—I’m so confused!" Amelia batted her lashes, her voice sickly sweet.

"Nathaniel, is Adrian really going to the Ashbournes’ tonight? He’s not coming here?" Seraphina changed the subject, gripping her husband’s arm.

"I don’t know." Nathaniel frowned.

"I just think it would be better if he came here."

Seraphina adopted a wise tone, softening her voice. "If it were Evadne’s birthday, fine. She’s the Bright family’s darling—maintaining good relations benefits us. But Vivienne? She’s from nothing, and that scandal still follows her. Adrian attending her party will just fuel gossip."

Her gaze darkened. "Besides, Vivienne is just Reginald’s mistress. Calling her his wife is generous. Is our Kingsley Group’s president really going to grovel to someone like that? It’s beneath us."

The word "mistress" made Nathaniel tense, memories of Adrian’s mother flashing in his mind.

"Vivienne wasn’t backed by anyone before. Now she has Reginald. She’s not the same. And if not for that incident years ago, she would’ve soared higher—never fallen into his hands."

Seraphina blinked. "Nathaniel, did I say something wrong?"

"I heard not only Adrian is going. My father is meeting Reginald too."

Nathaniel stared ahead, his tone clipped. "Tonight’s event isn’t just about Vivienne. You’re overlooking Reginald’s presence. If they want to go, let them. I’m too tired for these games."

What just happened? Why the sudden shift?

Seraphina choked back her anger, forcing a laugh.

Meanwhile, Cassandra curled up, drifting off.

Those nights with Harrison had left her exhausted—he was either kissing her or clinging to her, leaving her no time to sleep.

Beside her, Amelia trembled with rage, lips twitching as if she wanted to skin Cassandra alive.

You think you’re untouchable because Harrison backs you? The more you flaunt it, the sooner you’ll fall.

Seraphina’s party was low-key, but she still tipped off the media.

She was born for the spotlight—how could she exist without attention?

Reporters loitered outside the hotel, cameras ready.

When the Kingsleys arrived, Seraphina strutted like the queen she believed herself to be.

The journalists swarmed, snapping photos.

Nathaniel’s smile was tight, but he played the gracious husband beside Seraphina.

"Mr. Kingsley, your wife’s birthday is tonight, and the whole family is here—where’s Mr. Adrian?"

A journalist’s job was to ask the uncomfortable questions.

"Adrian is occupied. He couldn’t make it." Nathaniel brushed it off with a polite smile.

"Today is also Vivienne Ashbourne’s birthday. Mrs. Kingsley, your birthday was supposed to be Wednesday, but you moved it to Sunday. Was that intentional? You two were rivals back in your acting days. Rumor has it there was bad blood. Has that never been resolved?"

Seraphina gasped theatrically, her diamond-ringed hand covering her mouth. "Oh my! I had no idea today was Vivienne’s birthday. What a coincidence!"

She flashed a triumphant smile. "We moved it because our guests were busy Wednesday. We wanted everyone to have time to celebrate with us."

"Guests? You invited many?"

The reporters exchanged glances. "We’ve been here two hours. Haven’t seen anyone arrive."

Seraphina’s smile faltered.

She had invited hundreds—most had RSVP’d weeks ago.

Where were they?

Her nerves frayed, heart pounding like a drum.

"Let’s go inside," Nathaniel muttered.

At the banquet hall doors, the servant pulled them open.

The next second, Nathaniel and Seraphina’s smiles froze.

Especially Seraphina—her face drained of color, lower lip trembling as she fought back a scream.

The grand hall stood eerily empty.

Not a single guest in sight.

Where had they all gone?
###Chapter 306

The grand ballroom stood eerily empty, with only a sparse gathering of attendees. The atmosphere was painfully lackluster.

Apart from the scattered waitstaff and the lone pianist, not a single female guest graced the event. The high-society women who usually flocked to Elspeth, eager to curry favor with the Abernathy influence, were conspicuously absent. It was as if they had all silently agreed to boycott the affair.

Elspeth's rage simmered beneath her carefully composed exterior. If not for the swarm of reporters documenting every moment, she might have unleashed her fury right then.

Frederic's expression remained unreadable, his lips pressed into a thin line. Their daughter, Glynnis, looked stunned. She had always known her mother wasn't the most beloved, but she hadn't realized the depth of the disdain until now.

The reporters, however, were thriving on the spectacle. "Get more shots! This is front-page gold!" they whispered excitedly among themselves, cameras flashing relentlessly.

"Headline: 'Abernathy Matriarch's Lavish Birthday Bash—A Ghost Town. Has the Queen Bee Lost Her Sting?'"

"Didn't she boast about her guest list? Talk about a self-inflicted humiliation!"

Elspeth's legs trembled beneath her designer gown. She shot Glynnis a sharp glare, silently commanding her to handle the press.

Glynnis forced a smile. "Ladies and gentlemen, the celebration is about to begin. Please enjoy yourselves. Complimentary gifts will be distributed shortly!"

Security swiftly ushered the reporters out, though their murmurs lingered.

"Rushed us here in a snowstorm just to kick us out? Clearly, they're embarrassed!"

"Guests? What guests? This place is emptier than a Monday morning gym!"

The party had barely started, yet it already felt like a funeral.

Elspeth's fury was barely contained beneath her flawless makeup. To make matters worse, the handful of attendees were Frederic's associates, who offered her perfunctory greetings before engrossing themselves in conversation with him—completely disregarding her.

How had it come to this?

"Mom!" Glynnis rushed in, face pale. "I just found out—everyone we invited is at the K World Hotel, attending Evadne's party!"

Elspeth staggered, though she'd suspected as much.

"That little witch! Why must she always interfere?"

Mari, quietly playing with her teddy bear, perked up at the mention of her sister's name.

Glynnis continued, voice trembling with anger. "Half went for the Ashbournes, the other half for the Chambers. And since those families are close, the social climbers followed like sheep!"

She clenched her fists. "And some who weren't even invited by the Ashbournes somehow got Evadne's invitations and switched sides!"

Elspeth's face twisted. "She thinks she can humiliate me like this? That I'll just take it?"

Just then, the doors swung open. All eyes turned to the man striding in with effortless confidence.

"Jareth."

Mari's eyes welled with tears as she met his piercing gaze. Even in her plain dress, he always found her in a crowd.

Elspeth and Glynnis gaped in shock. Frederic, mid-conversation, raised a brow at Jareth's unexpected entrance.

Glynnis's hand, poised to strike, faltered. Despite everything, her traitorous heart still fluttered at the sight of him.

"Mr. Jareth! How wonderful of you to join us!" Elspeth gushed, rushing forward. "Champagne, quickly!"

Jareth smirked, hands in his pockets. "No need. I'm not here for the party."

"Then why—?"

"I'm here for my girl."

Silence.

With deliberate steps, he walked straight to Mari, ignoring Glynnis so thoroughly he nearly knocked her over.

"Mari." His voice softened as he gazed at her flushed face. "You look beautiful tonight."

Her heart raced.

"This place is dead. Come with me?" He extended his hand.

"Where?"

"Anywhere you want."

Tears pricked her eyes. For the first time, someone was choosing her.

"I want to see Evadne. And Thaddeus."

"Done."

He took her hand and led her away, leaving the room in stunned silence.

At the door, Jareth paused, offering Frederic a respectful nod before exiting. Frederic, momentarily irked, couldn't stay angry—the gesture had been too deliberate.

"Mom!" Glynnis hissed, panicked. "You can't let her leave! Bring her back!"

Elspeth scoffed. "Why? This party is already ruined. Besides, it's obvious Jareth wants her, not you. Stop embarrassing yourself."

Glynnis recoiled as if slapped.

Elspeth downed her champagne, eyes burning. "Evadne, you may have won this round, but I won't let you have the last laugh!"

Outside, Glynnis slipped into a secluded corner and dialed Edith, jaw clenched.

"Well, this is a surprise," Edith drawled.

Glynnis swallowed her pride. "You'll want to hear what happened tonight."
###Chapter 307

Jareth's fingers intertwined with Mari's, his grip warm and slightly damp. His gaze remained fixed straight ahead, unwavering.

He felt her palm slick with nervous sweat and couldn't help but chuckle. The sound was indulgent, laced with amusement.

"Mari, why aren't we heading to the underground parking?" Her voice trembled slightly as they neared the hotel lobby.

"My car's at the front entrance. The parking lot is too far."

"But the journalists—"

She stopped abruptly, her delicate frame shrinking under the weight of fear. "They'll write whatever they want."

"Let them."

Noticing her thin clothing, Jareth swiftly removed his red velvet blazer and draped it over her shoulders. His fingers worked deftly, buttoning it up with care. To her, he was both protector and lover.

"If they want to write, let them write about how I feel for you."

"They might say we're together," Mari whispered, her cheeks flushing crimson.

Her words brushed against his heart like a feather, sending shivers down his spine.

Jareth's eyes darkened as he swallowed hard, his large hand sliding up her back in a slow, soothing motion. "Good."

"W-what?" Her doe eyes widened in surprise.

"Mari, you're mine. Only mine. Do you understand what that means?" His grip tightened on her waist, his fingers tracing the delicate curve of her neck. Every inch of her was temptation.

She hesitated, then shook her head.

"It means I don't care what the world says. I want you by my side."

Mari gasped, her breath hitching under his burning gaze.

She wanted that too—more than anything.

Jareth pulled her closer, but she stiffened. Confusion flickered in his eyes. "Mari, what's wrong?"

"Let's take the back door."

Tears welled in her eyes as she pleaded softly, "I'm scared they'll mock you."

"Mari?" His voice sharpened.

"We can stay hidden. No one has to know. Please." She clasped her hands together. "I don't care if they laugh at me, but not you. Everyone who's ever been with me has been ridiculed. I can't bear it if they—"

Jareth's pupils contracted violently.

His chest tightened, a wave of crushing pain washing over him. Rage surged—hatred for those who had hurt her, and even more for himself, for not being there sooner.

"Ah! Put me down!"

Her vision blurred as he suddenly swept her into his arms.

"No."

His eyes burned with fierce determination as he strode toward the exit. "Let them try. I dare anyone to laugh at my woman. If they do, I'll make sure they regret it for the rest of their lives."

Outside, the hotel buzzed with activity.

Journalists lingered, cameras at the ready. When Jareth emerged with Mari cradled in his arms, shock rippled through the crowd.

"Who is that with Mr. Jareth? His new girlfriend?"

"Open your eyes! That's Mari Abernathy—the youngest Abernathy heir!"

"No way! The reclusive Abernathy daughter? She's stunning!"

"Glynnis Abernathy always bought headlines, claiming to be Elmsworth's most beautiful heiress. She's nothing compared to her sister."

"Of course. Any woman Jareth chooses is top-tier."

Lily rushed forward with two bodyguards, forming a protective barrier around them.

Cameras flashed relentlessly. Mari buried her face in Jareth's chest, shielding herself from the blinding lights.

"Don't be afraid," he murmured against her ear.

"Okay."

That single word meant more to him than a thousand ever could.

"Mr. Jareth! Is Ms. Mari your girlfriend?"

"Mr. Jareth! Have you two officially confirmed your relationship?"

The questions came rapid-fire, excitement crackling in the air.

Jareth halted, tightening his hold on Mari as he faced the cameras head-on. "Whether we're together is her choice. She can refuse me, but I've already made mine."

The crowd erupted in stunned whispers.

Jareth Fairhaven—the domineering heir who took what he wanted—was deferring to her decision?

The chaos intensified. It took Lily and the bodyguards considerable effort to get them into the car.

As they sped toward the K Orld Hotel, Lily hesitated. "Sir, there might be backlash online. I'll handle it quickly."

"Why?" His voice turned icy. "Have I done something shameful?"

"No, but—"

"Do I look like I care about gossip? Is it wrong to love someone openly?"

Absolutely not.

Lily fell silent.

Mari trembled slightly, meeting Jareth's tender gaze. "Jareth."

"Don't speak. This is my choice, not yours."

He brushed back her sweat-dampened hair, tucking it behind her ear—then froze.

A red mark marred her cheek.

"Mari, who did this?"

"I—I scratched it." She tried to cover it, but he caught her wrist.

His eyes darkened dangerously. "Was it Glynnis?"

She bit her lip, silent.

That woman would pay.

"Jareth, please. I don't want to cause you trouble." Her voice was small, laced with fear.

He gave a bitter smile, pressing a kiss to her forehead. "You're no trouble. Everything I do, I do willingly."

My love for you demands no secrecy. I want you by my side—openly, proudly.

Right on time—7 PM at the K Orld Hotel.
###Chapter 308

The Windsor Estates stood in stark contrast to the peaceful solitude of Isabella's home.

The hotel's grand entrance was lined with luxury vehicles, each belonging to influential tycoons and high-profile figures from the industry. Guests arrived dressed in their finest, dripping in jewels, their net worth collectively enough to buy a small country.

Though Alexander had intended to keep Evelyn's birthday celebration intimate at her request, the Sinclair family's prestige couldn't be ignored. Their growing investments in Elmsworth meant no one of importance would dare decline an invitation from Alexander.

And let's not forget—his daughter was currently the most talked-about socialite in town!

To avoid stealing Evelyn's spotlight, Victoria and Gabrielle chose to entertain their close friends upstairs rather than mingle in the main hall.

They didn't mind. In fact, they relished the rare, uninterrupted time together.

Outside the grand ballroom, as Evelyn's only daughter, Lillian was naturally tasked with greeting guests alongside her sister.

She wore a delicate chiffon gown in pale yellow, handpicked by Arabella. The soft fabric fluttered around her slender legs, giving her an ethereal glow—like the heroine of a romance novel come to life.

Lillian was deeply touched by Arabella's thoughtfulness.

Yet, even in her understated off-shoulder gown, Arabella effortlessly outshone everyone. Lillian stole glances at her sister, utterly mesmerized.

"Lillian, is there something on my face?" Arabella blinked her almond-shaped eyes at her dazed sister.

"No! Nothing!" Lillian flushed, flustered.

"Are you tired? The party hasn't even started yet. I can get you a room upstairs if you need to rest."

"No need, Arabella! I'm fine!" Lillian shook her head quickly.

"Miss Arabella, the Chambers brothers have arrived!"

Nathaniel, who had been managing the guest arrivals, rushed in, beads of sweat forming on his brow.

Seeing this, Lillian immediately pulled a handkerchief from her clutch, gripping it tightly but hesitating to approach.

"Nathaniel, you're sweating."

Arabella smirked, nudging Lillian forward with a gentle push. "Lillian has a handkerchief. Go help him."

Both Nathaniel and Lillian froze, their cheeks burning.

Clutching the handkerchief, Lillian awkwardly stepped forward.

Mustering courage, she reached up to dab his forehead.

He snatched the handkerchief from her hand and hastily wiped his own sweat, his pulse racing. "No need, Ms. Lillian. Thank you."

"It's... it's fine." Lillian bit her lip, disappointment flickering in her eyes.

"Your handkerchief is dirty now. I'll buy you a new one," Nathaniel muttered, stuffing it into his pocket.

"Keep it. Consider it a gift." Lillian forced a smile.

Arabella sighed internally.

Nathaniel, usually so attentive around her, turned into a bumbling fool around Lillian.

But one thing was clear—these two had something going on.

Right then, the Chambers family made their grand entrance.

Of the four Chambers siblings, only three had arrived—the youngest daughter was still abroad. But where was Adrian?

Matthew, the eldest, entered with his wife Cassandra, followed by Preston.

At the sight of Matthew, a shadow flickered in Arabella's eyes.

"Arabella, long time no see," Preston greeted, his gaze lighting up when he spotted her.

Her smile was polite but distant. "We met when you visited my home, Preston. It hasn't been that long. But you haven't seen my sister Lillian in ages."

She noticed Preston's obvious interest in her, which didn't bother her. Who wouldn't be drawn to perfection?

But she hated how Lillian, a Sinclair, was treated like an afterthought.

Caught off guard, Preston barely recognized Lillian.

"Hello, Preston," Lillian said warmly.

Matthew, expressionless, glanced at Lillian and Nathaniel before remarking coolly, "Preston, you're usually so meticulous. Yet the moment you see the Sinclair heiress, you forget basic manners. Apologize to Ms. Lillian."

"My apologies, Ms. Lillian. That was thoughtless of me." Preston bowed slightly.

Lillian smiled shyly.

"Nathaniel, please escort the Chambers family inside," Arabella instructed smoothly.

"Yes, Miss Arabella."

Once they were gone, Nathaniel quickly returned to Arabella's side, lowering his voice.

"Miss Arabella, we have a situation."

They moved to a quiet corner of the hall.

"Miss Arabella, Matthew's mistress—the one who humiliated Ms. Lillian that night—just showed up! She has an invitation and is already in the private area!"

Frowning, Nathaniel asked in a low voice, "Should I have security remove her immediately?"

"Remove her? Why bother? She was invited." Arabella leaned against the wall, her porcelain arms crossed. "We don't want to seem petty, do we?"

"That's impossible! I personally verified every invitation—one per guest! How did she get one?" Nathaniel was baffled.

"Oh, because I gave it to her."

Nathaniel gaped. "What?"

"I said, I invited that woman—Vanessa."

Arabella's lips curved like a crescent moon, her eyes gleaming with fox-like cunning. "Tonight's the perfect night to settle the score for my sister."

Nathaniel was speechless.
###Chapter 309

Mia's shrill voice cut through the elegant ambiance like a jagged knife.

"Let me in! I have an invitation, you imbeciles!"

Nydia froze mid-step, her blood running cold. That voice—she'd recognize it anywhere.

Mia.

Dressed in a cheap knockoff of a designer gown, Mia was making a scene at the entrance, waving a gold-embossed card in the security's faces.

Nydia's stomach twisted.

How had Mia gotten here? And why?

"Miss, this invitation is invalid," the guard stated firmly, blocking her path.

"Invalid? Are you blind?" Mia screeched, shoving the card at him. "This was personally given to me by—"

"By whom?"

A smooth, icy voice sliced through the commotion.

Evadne.

Dressed in a sleek black gown that shimmered like liquid night, she stepped forward, her presence commanding immediate silence.

Mia's bravado faltered.

Up close, Evadne was even more breathtaking—her sharp features, the effortless grace, the way her gaze pinned Mia like a butterfly to a board.

"Miss Ashbourne," the guard bowed. "This woman is attempting entry with a counterfeit invitation."

Evadne plucked the card from Mia's trembling fingers, examining it with a bored flick of her wrist.

"Ah." A slow, dangerous smile curved her lips. "How interesting."

Mia bristled. "It's not fake! K Group sent it to me!"

"Did they?" Evadne's laugh was soft, mocking. "Then perhaps you should inform them they forgot our family's seal."

Nydia's pulse pounded.

Evadne was toying with Mia, and Mia was too stupid to realize it.

Jason moved to Evadne's side, his expression unreadable. "Shall I have her removed?"

"Not yet." Evadne tilted her head. "I'm curious—who told you this would work?"

Mia's confidence wavered. "I—I don't know what you're talking about."

"Liar." Evadne's smile vanished. "You're here because someone promised you access. Who?"

Mia's gaze darted to Nydia, then back. "Mr. Chambers arranged it."

A beat of silence.

Evadne's eyes gleamed. "Ah. Matthew Chambers."

Nydia's breath hitched.

Jason's jaw tightened.

Mia, sensing she'd misstepped, scrambled to recover. "He—he wanted me here! As his guest!"

Evadne sighed. "Pathetic." She handed the fake invitation to Jason. "Call the police."

Mia blanched. "You can't—!"

"I can." Evadne's voice dropped to a whisper. "And I will."

Mia lunged—not at Evadne, but at Nydia. "This is your fault! You worthless—!"

Jason intercepted her, wrenching her arm back with a sharp twist. Mia yelped.

Nydia flinched.

Evadne stepped between them, shielding Nydia. "Touch my sister again," she murmured, "and I'll break every bone in your hand."

Mia's face drained of color. "S-sister?"

Evadne smirked. "Surprise."

The realization hit Mia like a freight train.

Nydia—the girl she'd bullied, mocked, tormented—was an Ashbourne.

A princess.

And Mia had just signed her own ruin.

"Take her away," Evadne ordered.

As security dragged Mia off, her screams fading into the night, Nydia exhaled shakily.

Evadne squeezed her shoulder. "You okay?"

Nydia nodded, blinking back tears. "Thank you."

Evadne winked. "Anytime, little sister."

Across the ballroom, unseen, Matthew Chambers watched—his grip tightening around his champagne flute.

Game on.
###Chapter 310

The grand ballroom shimmered with crystal chandeliers and the murmur of elite conversations. Isabella Sinclair and Nathan Prescott stood near the champagne fountain, engaged in what appeared to be a pleasant exchange.

As the newly appointed CEO of Sinclair Holdings, Nathan had swiftly taken control of multiple high-profile subsidiaries. Being the favored eldest son, it was only a matter of time before he inherited the entire Sinclair empire.

Isabella, the eldest daughter of the Kingsley family, was equally poised to inherit K Group. Despite the Ashbourne family's impartial stance, Nathan still found it prudent to maintain cordial relations with her.

Though Nathan privately disapproved of the Kingsley family's polygamous traditions, he masked his disdain behind a polished smile.

"President Kingsley," Nathan began smoothly, raising his glass, "I hear K Group is making impressive strides in Elmsworth. Your momentum is remarkable. Our families have a long history—our fathers were practically brothers. I hope we can carry that legacy forward."

Isabella tilted her glass in acknowledgment, her lips curving slightly.

"Should K Group have any promising ventures in Elmsworth, I hope you'll consider Sinclair Holdings as a partner," Nathan continued, taking a measured sip. "Together, we could dominate not just Elmsworth, but the entire country."

"Mr. Sinclair, I appreciate the sentiment," Isabella replied, her voice calm, "but I’m afraid I’ll be stepping back soon."

Nathan and his wife, Victoria, exchanged puzzled glances. "President Kingsley, what do you mean?"

"Being CEO was never my ambition," Isabella admitted, her gaze softening as she thought of her younger sister. "I only took the role to support my father, to give my siblings the freedom to chase their dreams without the burden of corporate responsibilities."

She paused, her smile deepening. "Now that my sister, Arabella, has returned—eager, capable, and passionate about business—I intend to pass the reins to her once the transition is complete."

Nathan's expression faltered. "You're saying Chairman Kingsley plans to appoint Arabella as CEO?"

"Precisely," Isabella confirmed without hesitation.

It was no secret that Arabella was the family's chosen successor. Among the Kingsley heirs, none matched her brilliance.

"But Arabella is so young," Victoria interjected gently. "Shouldn't she be enjoying her youth? In a few years, she'll marry and focus on her family. That’s the natural path for an heiress, isn’t it?"

Nathan nodded in agreement. "And with so many talented brothers, surely one of them could take the helm. Isn’t this too much pressure for a young woman?"

Isabella chuckled, her eyes glinting with amusement. "Arabella isn’t like most women. If you tried to confine her to domestic life, she’d flee abroad again—only returning when I’m on my deathbed."

She took a sip of champagne, her tone turning fond yet firm. "So, to keep her close, I’ll gladly step aside. Whatever she desires, if it’s within my power, I’ll give it to her."

Victoria blinked, stunned.

The Sinclair family had four children, all from the same mother, yet they were constantly at each other’s throats.

The Kingsleys, with multiple wives and numerous heirs, should have been a battleground. Instead, they willingly sacrificed personal gain for one another.

Unbelievable.

Nathan offered polite praise, but inwardly, he scoffed at Isabella’s lack of ambition. Sacrificing her future for a sister? Foolish.

"Mr. Sinclair!"

Nathan’s secretary hurried over, hesitating when he noticed Victoria’s presence.

"Excuse me," Nathan said smoothly, stepping aside.

Isabella nodded. "Of course."

The moment Nathan left, Victoria’s smile vanished.

"What is it?" Nathan demanded in a low voice.

"Vanessa is here," the secretary whispered, wiping his brow. "She was stopped at the entrance by the Kingsley security. She’s making a scene—insulted Miss Lillian Kingsley. It’s already reached Arabella’s ears."

Nathan’s jaw tightened. "Get rid of her."

"But, sir, Arabella won’t let this go unless you intervene."

Nathan adjusted his cufflinks, his expression darkening. "Fine."

Arabella wanted to deal with Vanessa immediately, but Lillian begged her to handle it discreetly, fearing their parents would hear of the scandal.

Now, in a secluded antechamber, Vanessa stood trembling between two towering bodyguards. Her earlier arrogance had evaporated.

Arabella lounged elegantly on a velvet sofa, Lillian beside her. Nathaniel, her secretary, offered them a platter of fresh fruit.

Arabella fed her sister a strawberry, her demeanor relaxed, but her eyes held a dangerous glint.

"Nathaniel mentioned Vanessa insulted you quite viciously that night," Arabella remarked, her tone deceptively light.

Vanessa shuddered, her knees buckling.

Arabella’s presence was suffocating—a woman who commanded fear effortlessly.

"Arabella, let me handle this," Lillian pleaded, her voice shaky. "It’s between Vanessa and me. You shouldn’t get involved."

Arabella stroked Lillian’s hair, her voice softening. "Sweetheart, I know you’re trying to protect me. But this is my gift to you—a lesson on how to deal with those who forget their place."

Vanessa’s breath hitched. Her only hope now was Nathan.

The doors swung open.

Nathan strode in, his gaze icy.

Nathaniel’s expression darkened at the sight of him—a reminder of past humiliations.

"Mr. Sinclair! Help me!" Vanessa cried, tears streaking her makeup. "I’ve been framed!"

Nathan’s lips thinned. Vanessa was just another fling—a meaningless distraction. Now she’d dragged him into her mess.

"Ms. Kingsley," Nathan said coolly, "what seems to be the issue?"

"Your companion assaulted my secretary and insulted my sister," Arabella replied, her smile razor-sharp. "I thought you’d want to clean up your own mess. It’s beneath me to dirty my hands."

Nathan understood. This wasn’t just about Vanessa—Arabella was challenging him.

"Apologize," Nathan ordered Vanessa.

"I’m sorry! I was blind, I was stupid!" Vanessa sobbed, bowing frantically.

Arabella arched a brow. "An apology isn’t enough."

Nathan’s jaw clenched. "Nathaniel."

Without hesitation, Nathaniel stepped forward and struck Vanessa—hard.

The sharp crack echoed. Vanessa collapsed, blood trickling from her lip.

Lillian flinched, turning away.

"Don’t look," Arabella murmured, shielding her sister. "Nathaniel, comfort her."

Lillian blushed. Nathaniel hesitated, his pulse racing.

"Later," Arabella amended with a smirk. She rose, guiding Lillian toward the exit.

As she passed Nathan, she tossed over her shoulder, "This room is quite private. Do hurry—the banquet is starting."

The door clicked shut.

Minutes later, Nathan emerged alone, his Patek Philippe watch smeared with blood. Behind him, faint whimpers faded into silence.

"Clean this up," he ordered his secretary.

Then, his lips curled into a chilling smile.

"Arabella Kingsley," he mused, cracking his knuckles. "It’s been years since anyone dared challenge me—least of all a woman. If she wants to play, I’ll play."

Arabella’s fury had been for Lillian’s sake, and it felt satisfying.

But Lillian was uneasy.

Tactfully, Arabella excused herself, leaving Nathaniel alone with Lillian on the moonlit balcony.

Lillian shivered in the evening breeze. Nathaniel immediately draped his jacket over her shoulders.

"Did you tell Arabella about Vanessa?" Lillian asked quietly.

Nathaniel swallowed. "Yes."

"Why?" Lillian’s voice trembled. "My problems are mine to handle. Why drag her into this? She’s already overwhelmed. And now Nathan is involved—do you think he’ll let this go?"

"Miss Lillian—"

"You’re her secretary!" Lillian’s eyes flashed. "You should protect her, not make her a target!"

Nathaniel’s chest ached. Suddenly, he gripped her shoulders, his gaze burning.

"I couldn’t stand it," he confessed hoarsely. "Hearing that woman insult you—I wanted to tear her apart. I couldn’t bear her hurting you."

Lillian’s breath caught.

His hands trembled against her skin. "I know I overstepped. I’ll apologize to Arabella. But I couldn’t stay silent. Not when it comes to you."

Lillian’s lashes fluttered. Slowly, she leaned forward, resting her forehead against his shoulder.

She remembered something she’d once read:

Love is the courage of the timid, the generosity of the poor, the gamble of the cautious.

It’s the stuttered confession of the inarticulate.

And above all—the relentless pursuit of something impossible, without hesitation.
###Chapter 311

Isabella Sinclair walked toward the grand ballroom, a playful melody humming on her lips.

She knew Vanessa Wright was about to face a storm.

Well, let the show begin.

She knew Alexander Kingsley—or rather, she knew men like him. Superficial creatures, their pride more fragile than glass. And if anyone dared tarnish the reputation of the Sinclair family's golden boy? They'd pay dearly.

Vanessa deserved every bit of it for messing with her sister. A little humiliation was the least she should suffer.

"Isabella."

A deep, achingly familiar voice called from behind her.

Her pulse stuttered, fingers curling into fists.

No other voice in the world could unravel her like this.

Only his.

The man she had once loved beyond reason. The man who had shattered her.

Isabella inhaled sharply, steadying herself before turning, her gaze glacial.

Nathaniel Hawthorne stood a few paces away, holding an exquisitely wrapped gift box. He closed the distance between them with effortless grace, his presence commanding as always. His eyes softened the moment they landed on her.

Isabella remained impassive. "Hmm."

His lips pressed together, regret shadowing his gaze. "I meant to arrive earlier—to see if you needed help. But it seems I'm late." The man who had once carried himself like royalty now stood before her with the humility of a penitent.

"Why would we need an outsider's help for a Sinclair event?"

She scoffed, glancing around. "Where's Grandfather? Didn't he come with you?"

"He's already here. In the lounge with Chairman Reginald," Nathaniel answered gently.

"Good. I'll go see him. You can do whatever you want."

Without hesitation, she turned to leave.

"Isabella—" Nathaniel reacted instantly, his hand closing around her wrist.

"Let go!" She jerked back, cheeks flushing. "If someone sees us, it'll cause rumors!"

"There's no one here. Just us."

He exhaled sharply, pulling her closer. "I'm not wasting another chance, Isabella. Not when I can finally hold you again."

Caught off balance in her stilettos, she gasped—

And then she was pressed against the solid warmth of his chest.

Nathaniel barely had time to react, one arm securing her while the other still clutched the gift box.

"Ugh—" Isabella braced against his muscled forearm.

His breath hitched.

She was soft. Warm.

Her curves fit against him perfectly, igniting a fire he couldn't suppress.

Damn it. He was only human.

His thoughts scattered as heat flooded his veins, his grip tightening.

"Isabella," he murmured against her ear, voice rough. "You're breathtaking."

The words sent a shiver down her spine, his body radiating heat that threatened to consume her.

Her eyes flashed with fury. She shoved him away and slapped him—hard. "You disgusting pig!"

The sting barely registered.

Instead, Nathaniel felt exhilarated, drunk on her nearness.

"Even if you hit me, I won't lie. You're stunning." His gaze burned with sincerity.

Was this harassment? Or just brutal honesty?

"Shut up!" Her face burned. "Stay away from me, or I swear you'll regret it!"

"I don't care about consequences." He stepped closer, undeterred. "There's nothing I want more than you, Isabella. If you push me away, I might as well be dead."

"Then die!" She whirled around, stomping off in frustration.

She knew he was relentless. Impossible to shake.

But to take advantage of the moment and comment on her body? Unforgivable!

No wonder he and Daniel Carter were best friends. Birds of a feather!

Nathaniel watched her storm away, imagining the furious blush on her cheeks.

A slow, satisfied smile curved his lips.

"Isabella!"

Another voice—clear, powerful—rang out behind her.

Her heart lurched.

She spun around, eyes instantly welling with tears. She sprinted past Nathaniel toward the woman who had called her.

"Seraphina!"

"Isabella!"

This time, the voice cracked with emotion.

Nathaniel turned, stunned.

Who had called her?

A woman in an elegant sapphire suit stood nearby, her delicate features striking. Her makeup was flawless, her eyes sharp with intelligence.

The resemblance to Eleanor Sinclair was uncanny.

Had Isabella just called her Seraphina?

Was this the legendary sister who had married into the Lockwood family?

Isabella threw her arms around Seraphina Lockwood, her half-sister, tears of joy spilling over.

"Seraphina! When did you get back? Why didn't you tell me? I would've picked you up!"

"I just arrived tonight—barely an hour ago." Seraphina hugged her tightly, voice thick with emotion. "I didn’t want to disrupt your preparations."

"This is the best surprise!" Isabella choked out, clinging to her.

"You’ve lost weight." Seraphina cupped her face, concern flickering. "Your cheeks used to be so full. Who’s been neglecting you?"

Nathaniel’s chest tightened.

He remembered when Isabella had first married him—her face had been rounder, softer.

But over time, the light in her eyes had dimmed. Her cheeks had hollowed.

Had he done that to her?

He deserved hell.

"My brother used to tease me for being chubby. Now he can’t!" Isabella grinned, leaning into Seraphina’s shoulder. "And even if I’m thinner, I’m still gorgeous, right?"

"Of course you are." Seraphina, though only three years older, doted on her like a mother.

"Miss Seraphina."

Nathaniel approached, his expression carefully neutral.

Seraphina blinked in surprise, studying the striking man before her. "Mr. Hawthorne?"

"Just Nathaniel, please." He extended his hand, charm radiating effortlessly.

He didn’t resemble the ruthless tycoon from the rumors.

Before Seraphina could respond, Isabella yanked her back. "Don’t even think about cozying up to my sister, Nathaniel. Your tricks won’t work here."

Nathaniel withdrew his hand, lips quirking awkwardly.

"Isabella, what’s going on between you two?" Seraphina asked, baffled by her sister’s hostility.

She had no idea they’d once been married.

Isabella flushed.

"Seraphina, I’m Isabella’s husband."

Both women froze.

"Or rather," Nathaniel corrected smoothly, gaze searing into Isabella, "I intend to be again. She can have other men, but I only want her."

Seraphina inhaled sharply.

Isabella’s face burned.

The audacity!

"Mr. Hawthorne, are you pursuing my sister?" Seraphina ventured.

"With everything I have." His voice was raw with conviction.

"Seraphina! Ignore him—he’s delusional!" Isabella dragged her away.

Nathaniel watched them go, grinning like a fool.

Hopelessly in love? Absolutely.

"Did you come back alone?" Isabella asked, squeezing Seraphina’s hand. "Where’s your husband?"

"Adrian’s swamped. The election results are days away."

"He’ll win. You’ve campaigned tirelessly for him."

"Let’s hope so." Seraphina glanced back, lowering her voice. "Now tell me—what’s really going on with Nathaniel Hawthorne?"

Isabella gritted her teeth. "Oil and water. We don’t mix."

"Really? Because from what I’ve heard, he’s one of the most powerful men in the country."

Remembering his shameless advances, Isabella wanted to scream.

"Powerful? More like insufferable!"
###Chapter 312

The Ashbourne household erupted in joyous chaos when Isabella Sinclair made her unexpected return.

As Isabella's birth mother, Eleanor remained the epitome of composure among the three matriarchs. Years had passed since anyone witnessed her shed a tear. Yet now, her eyes shimmered with restrained emotion at her daughter's homecoming.

Her stepmothers, Victoria and Arabella, displayed no such restraint. They enveloped Isabella in tearful embraces so fervent one might mistake Eleanor for the stepmother.

"Enough! Give the girl some air!"

Sebastian Sinclair stood nearby, his handsome features contorted with impatience. "My turn now!"

The family exchanged exasperated glances.

With reluctant sighs, Victoria and Arabella released their hold.

Sebastian swooped in, clutching Isabella like a drowning man to driftwood, his sobs outpacing the women's. "My precious girl! Did marriage make you forget your old man? Not a single visit in all this time! Such ingratitude!"

The room collectively rolled their eyes.

Watching her father's theatrics, Evelyn Sinclair buried her face in her hands.

At least this embarrassment happened behind closed doors.

"Dad, I never forgot you," Isabella soothed, patting his back. "Alexander's been swamped with the election campaign. I only told him I was coming after boarding the plane. Don't be cross - I brought you that bone china set you've been coveting."

The family watched with sympathetic smiles. Years ago, Isabella had defied her father to marry Alexander Kingsley, the congressman a decade her senior. Love had carried her overseas, leaving fewer opportunities for family visits.

None could have predicted how the Ashbourne daughter would blossom abroad. Second only to the Queen in public admiration, her social standing now surpassed even Evelyn's - a fact that filled her sister with quiet pride.

"Where's my gift then?" Sebastian's tears vanished as curiosity took hold, transforming him into a child pacified by candy.

"I gave it to your secretary upon arrival, along with Arabella's birthday jewelry." Isabella turned warm eyes to Arabella. "Happy birthday."

"Your presence is gift enough," Arabella sniffled, ever the sentimental one.

"And what did that husband of yours send?" Sebastian demanded, still unsatisfied.

"Father, enough." Evelyn fixed him with a withering stare. "Your collection could stock a museum. What's the point of hoarding treasures you can't take with you?"

"You youngsters understand nothing!" Sebastian pouted.

Evelyn smirked. "You're just greedy. In another era, you'd be the corrupt official taking bribes."

"And what would you be?"

Chin lifted, Evelyn declared, "The moralist exposing corruption at every turn!"

Laughter filled the room.

"Where's our brother? Shouldn't he be here by now?" Evelyn asked.

Nathaniel checked his watch. "I'll call him."

Meanwhile, mere blocks from the Windsor Estates...

Camille Dubois gripped the wheel of her pink Ferrari, Bluetooth headset flashing as she waited at the light.

"Get me those Paris Fashion Week designs now or consider our partnership terminated! If they ever want to showcase in New York again, they'll find every door slammed shut!"

The light turned green. Fuming, Camille floored the accelerator.

Her Ferrari shot forward like a pink bullet.

At that moment, a discreet Mercedes sped around the opposite corner. Both vehicles took their turns too sharply, too fast.

"Merde!"

Distracted by her call, Camille noticed the oncoming sedan too late. She slammed the brakes, tires screeching against asphalt.

The Mercedes driver reacted simultaneously. The collision was inevitable.

Impact.

Camille's body jerked violently as airbags deployed, smacking her in the face. The windshield cracked but held - sparing her from potential disfigurement.

"Quelle horreur!" She shoved the door open, rubbing her neck as she stormed out.

Her limited-edition pink Ferrari now resembled crumpled tissue paper.

"Mon bébé!" Camille wailed, indifferent to her ruined hairstyle.

The Mercedes fared no better, hood crumpled and engine smoking.

Dominic Blackwood emerged, coughing.

"Are you blind? You saw my car and still plowed right into—" Camille's tirade died mid-sentence.

The man before her was Adonis incarnate - chiseled jaw, broad shoulders, narrow waist, and an ass that could grace magazine covers. Her inner fangirl short-circuited.

Wait.

Why did he seem familiar?

"Miss, I can drive just fine," Dominic rasped, massaging his neck. "What I can't do is prevent idiots from ramming into me. Were you in such a hurry to meet your maker?"

"Me? You're the one who—" Camille's protest faltered as she noticed her stiletto-clad feet. The law clearly prohibited both heels and phones while driving.

"You crossed the solid line!" she accused instead.

"Let the police determine fault. I don't have time for this." Dominic produced a business card. "Contact my office with the repair bills."

"You think you can just dump this mess on me? I'm in a hurry too!" Camille flung the card back. "This could be fake for all I know! Some well-dressed scam artist!"

"Scam artist?" Dominic's laugh held no humor. "If I'm a scammer, then honesty is extinct. I'm leaving."

Camille seized his arm, eyes blazing. "You wrecked my brand-new Ferrari! You're not walking away!"

Dominic exhaled sharply. Time was precious, especially with family waiting. He extracted a black card from his wallet. "Take this. No PIN. Fix your car."

Camille stared at the offered card, humiliation burning her cheeks. "You think your petty cash can fix a limited-edition Ferrari? Are you simple?"

"Then buy a new one. The limit should suffice."

As Dominic turned to leave, he suddenly gasped.

Camille had yanked his navy tie, pulling him nose-to-nose. His breath hitched at their sudden proximity - closer than he'd been to any woman besides Evelyn in thirty years.

The swell of her breasts beneath that red dress brushed his shirt. He fixed his gaze rigidly on her eyes, like a monk resisting temptation.

"What are you playing at?" His voice roughened.

With a haughty sniff, Camille produced her own black card, tapping it against his cheek. "I've enough here to support you into retirement, petit garçon."

Dominic's pulse stuttered inexplicably.

"Don't flatter yourself with your dirty money. My mentor's a billionaire's daughter and world-renowned designer. She could buy you ten times over without breaking a sweat!"

Something clicked in Dominic's mind. That description sounded... familiar.

Finished, Camille tossed the card at his shoes, lifted her chin, and strutted back to her battered Ferrari.

Dominic watched the pink car vanish into the night, lips quirking.

"Pink. How gauche."
###Chapter 313

The birthday celebration was just getting started.

The grand hall buzzed with elite guests, their laughter and chatter filling the air. Isabella's lips curved into a smile as she spotted Alexander and Grandfather Sinclair deep in conversation near the center of the room. "Well, isn't that Mr. Dubois?"

"Indeed! Age seems to only enhance his distinguished presence," a nearby guest remarked.

"It's rare to witness such camaraderie between Mr. Dubois and Chairman Alexander these days. One might mistake them for father and son!"

"Did you hear? Mrs. Vanderbilt is hosting her own birthday gala tonight. Yet Mr. Dubois chose to attend Chairman Alexander's instead. Quite telling, isn't it?" The guests exchanged knowing glances.

"Clearly, Mr. Dubois has no affection for his daughter—I mean, Victoria. After six months of bribery scandals, auction fraud, and that humiliating incident with Mr. Kingsley's niece, who could blame him?"

"I've seen Mr. Kingsley with Chairman Alexander's daughter, Miss Isabella. They make quite the striking pair. Remember how he defended her during that auction debacle? Do you think there's potential there?"

Isabella's brow furrowed at the overheard conversation.

"Unlikely, I'd say."

"Why so?"

"Recall his messy breakup with that Stirling girl? The whole city was talking. Someone as refined as Miss Isabella wouldn't tolerate such baggage."

Isabella gave a subtle nod of agreement.

"Exes are like uninvited guests at a dinner party—you can ignore them until they start making scenes at your table. No matter how much you pretend it doesn't matter, it's still revolting! Mr. Kingsley might be eligible, but Miss Isabella deserves better than damaged goods."

Another firm nod from Isabella.

"Enjoying the show?"

Isabella startled, looking up to find Nathaniel standing beside her, his lips curved in that infuriatingly charming smile, eyes warm with amusement.

"I wasn't eavesdropping!" She turned away sharply, teeth sinking into her lower lip.

Caught red-handed.

"They got most of it right," Nathaniel murmured as he gracefully took the seat beside her, "but missed one crucial detail." His gaze lingered on her flushed cheeks. "I don't just have an ex—I have an ex-wife."

"And you're proud of that, Mr. Kingsley?" Isabella crossed her arms, smirk playing on her lips.

Seeing her irritation, Nathaniel's smile turned rueful. "Isabella, pride is the last thing I feel when it comes to you."

Her expression softened slightly, heartbeat quickening.

"I only feel regret."

His voice grew rough, handsome features darkening. "I regret how I treated you. That our marriage was kept secret. That the world never knew you were my wife."

"If that's the case, spare your regrets, Mr. Kingsley." She turned away, voice icy. "I'm grateful our miserable marriage was never made public."

Miserable marriage.

Nathaniel swallowed hard, the words like knives.

Even after everything, to Isabella, he remained nothing more than a regrettable Chapter she wished to forget.

"It makes moving on easier. I can pretend we were never together."

Isabella blinked, then laughed lightly. "Well, we never really were, were we?"

"Isabella—"

Before he could continue, a cheerful voice interrupted. "Master! Sorry I'm late!"

Isabella turned to see her protégé Camille, face instantly brightening.

"Camille! You made it! I thought you'd be too busy with the gallery opening!"

Camille rushed over, embracing her tightly. "Miss your birthday feast? I'd cancel the exhibition first!"

Then she noticed Nathaniel seated beside Isabella, his imposing presence impossible to ignore.

Her pretty face soured instantly. "Master, you're sitting with him? Doesn't he disgust you?"

Isabella glanced at the man beside her indifferently. "Profoundly."

Nathaniel's heart ached, yet he managed, "Isabella, if my presence offends you, don't look."

Internally, he thought, "But I'm not moving."

"Should I gouge my eyes out then?" Isabella scoffed.

"You could close them," Nathaniel teased, leaning closer, voice dropping to that intimate timbre that always unsettled her.

"And how would I eat?" Ever quick-witted, Isabella walked right into his trap.

"I'd be honored to feed you." His breath warmed her ear, sending shivers down her spine.

Isabella tried to scoot her chair away, but Nathaniel—predicting her move—wrapped an arm around her waist, anchoring her in place.

"You—!" Her cheeks burned as she met his warm gaze.

"Isabella, it's just dinner. Don't go." His eyes brimmed with longing.

"Nathaniel."

She wrenched her hand free, fingers digging into his wrist—a gesture of defiance and pain. Her delicate hand barely encircled his muscular wrist, but she squeezed with all her might. "Sitting down to a simple meal with you, like any normal couple, was once my dream. Now? The thought turns my stomach."

Nathaniel released her waist, defeated. "Isabella, I'm sorry."

"It's a celebration, Nathaniel. Don't ruin it with apologies." She waved him off dismissively. "You're here now. Might as well stay."

A small concession, but Nathaniel clung to it.

"Guess who I ran into on the way!" Camille interjected, trying to lighten the mood. "Some arrogant prick nearly ran me over!"

Nathaniel sipped his water, maintaining composure. Camille, the celebrated fashion designer known for her elegance, became remarkably crude around Isabella.

"Do tell," Isabella prompted, intrigued.

Nathaniel nearly choked on his drink.

So much for refined company.

"Right as I arrived. There was a car accident."

Both Isabella and Nathaniel looked shocked.

Who could be so casual about a collision?

"Are you hurt? Why didn't you call? I'd have taken you to the hospital!" Isabella gripped Camille's shoulders anxiously.

"Just a stiff neck. Nothing serious." Camille warmed at Isabella's concern.

"You should get checked regardless. Some injuries manifest later." Nathaniel spoke up unexpectedly. "After the celebration, I'll arrange for a specialist to examine you, regardless of the hour."

Camille blinked, surprised by the offer from this "filthy man."

"No need." Isabella pulled Camille close protectively. "I'm a surgeon. I'll handle my apprentice. Don't trouble yourself, Mr. Kingsley."

Nathaniel's lips twisted wryly.

Once again, his concern was discarded.

"This jerk in a luxury car nearly hits me, then has the audacity to hand me his credit card and tell me to buy a new car!" Camille fumed. "The nerve!"

The memory fueled her anger. "Master, is he implying I'm some gold-digger? As if I've never seen money before! Who does he think he is?"

"What happened next?" Isabella leaned in, fascinated.

"I threw my bank card in his face and said I had enough to keep him!"

Nathaniel listened quietly, amused.

"Priceless," Isabella smirked. "I'd have thought you two would get along. Both equally lacking in manners."

In Camille's mind, Sebastian's handsome features flashed—sharp eyes, flawless complexion, the effortless grace of his movements.

She swallowed hard, throat suddenly dry.

"As if I'd ever associate with such a man!"

Just then, her eyes widened as she spotted someone approaching. "You! What are you doing here?"

Isabella and Nathaniel turned to see a strikingly handsome man walking toward them.

"The audacity," Camille muttered. "Why are you here?"

"Me? I should be asking you that," the man replied coolly.

"Camille, you know him?" Isabella asked, surprised.

"He's the bastard who almost killed me with his car!"

Isabella's eyes gleamed with sudden understanding. She stood, approaching the man and looping an arm around his neck familiarly.

"Camille, allow me to reintroduce my brother, Sebastian Sinclair—Elmsworth's top prosecutor."
###Chapter 314

Camille's face drained of color in an instant, as if struck by lightning. Her mind went completely blank.

She was flustered.

Lost.

Panicked.

So, the man she had just been badmouthing to Evadne was her master's own brother?

Mortification burned through her like wildfire.

Thaddeus sat there, glancing between them, biting his lower lip to suppress a laugh.

But he understood Camille's predicament all too well.

With Evadne's countless siblings, it was no surprise to bump into one unexpectedly. He, too, had suffered from not knowing the Ashbourne family dynamics and had endured the torment of her brothers.

Arnold watched as Camille's delicate face flushed from pale to crimson, like a ripening cherry.

He was still irritated about the "sponsorship" comment, but seeing her so adorably flustered, his anger melted away. "Master."

Camille looked at Evadne with pleading eyes, her voice trembling. "You won't disown me over this, will you?"

Evadne tapped her chin, pretending to consider it.

"Master!" Camille's lips quivered, tears welling up.

Evadne stepped closer, paused, then broke into a radiant smile.

"Silly girl, why would I disown you over something so trivial? If I did, who would be left to carry on my legacy?"

Relief washed over Camille, but embarrassment lingered.

"Besides," Evadne added, casting a pointed glance at Arnold, "I know you're a good person. If you scolded my brother, he must have deserved it."

Arnold raised a brow, swallowing his indignation.

Who would've thought the woman who crashed into his car and had the audacity to flirt with him was so close to his little sister?

Fate had a cruel sense of humor.

Just then, the room erupted with laughter as a lively group arrived—Suri, Aviana, Cassius, Nydia, and Aaron, who had been dragged from work. Jareth and Mari followed close behind.

They swarmed Evadne with hugs and chatter, the air buzzing with joy.

The scene was like something out of a fairy tale—handsome men, stunning women, an unforgettable spectacle.

Amid the warmth and laughter, Thaddeus sat alone, his melancholic gaze fixed on Evadne, surrounded by love.

Envy and longing flickered in his eyes before they grew damp.

This was the life Evadne was meant to have—cherished, adored, protected.

The only pain she had ever known was because of him.

Swallowing his bitterness, he made a silent vow.

Even if she never chose him, he would spend his life shielding her from harm.

"Mari! You're here too!" Evadne pinched Mari's soft cheeks, her heart swelling with happiness.

Mari clutched her teddy bear, murmuring shyly, "I missed you, Evadne. And Thaddeus. I wanted to see you both."

Thaddeus's lips twitched in amusement.

His sweet sister still believed Evadne was her sister-in-law.

Evadne stiffened at the title but softened when she saw the teddy bear she had gifted Mari.

"I missed you too," she said, stroking Mari's hair.

Then her gaze turned icy as she rounded on Jareth. "Did you bring her here? From Elspeth's party?"

Jareth smirked. "I did."

"You dare smile?" Evadne jabbed a finger into his shoulder. "You only think about yourself! What happens when Mari goes back? Frederic and Elspeth will make her life hell!"

"Go back?" Jareth's eyes darkened. "To a mother who doesn’t care and a sister who’s a monster? Why should she?"

He pulled Mari closer. "She's been living with me."

Evadne's eyes widened. "What?"

"I transferred one of my mountain villas to her name. It's her home now. If she ever wants to escape that house, she can stay there."

Evadne nearly choked on her fury.

Thaddeus stood abruptly, his voice sharp. "When did this happen?"

Jareth raised his hands defensively. "We haven’t done anything!"

Countless women had thrown themselves at him, but with Mari, he hadn’t so much as unbuttoned her sleeve.

She was pure. He was not.

Just being near her was enough.

"Like I'd believe that," Evadne scoffed. "You not touching women is like believing in moon dogs!"

Jareth grimaced.

At this moment, he felt like an unwanted son-in-law.

"Thaddeus! Evadne!" Mari stepped between them, her cheeks flushed. "Don’t scold him. I want to be with him!"

Both froze.

Jareth's heart pounded as he wrapped his arms around her from behind, resting his chin on her head.

"Mari," Evadne said gently, "after the banquet, come to Grandpa’s with me, okay?"

Mari bit her lip, silent.

Evadne sighed. "You really want to stay with him?"

Mari met her gaze, her eyes clear and resolute.

No words were needed.

"Fine," Evadne relented.

Thaddeus touched her arm. "If she’s happy, let her be."

Evadne turned to him, their eyes locking.

"I know," she murmured.

His lips curved. "But remember—I care about her too."

His words, simple yet profound, sent a flutter through her chest.

She looked away quickly.

That was Thaddeus—every word deliberate, every promise unbreakable.

As Emeric and Myra arrived, the group settled at the table.

Despite the hostile glares, Thaddeus sat stubbornly beside Evadne, unbothered.

Aaron glared at him. "This table is for Ashbournes and friends. What are you doing here?"

Thaddeus smirked, gaze fixed on Evadne. "I’m exactly where I belong. Wherever she sits, I sit."

Evadne nearly choked on her water.

Aaron cursed under his breath.

Aviana leaned back, fingers drumming the table. "In our family, we don’t let dogs at the table."

Thaddeus's jaw clenched.

He loved Evadne, but he wouldn’t tolerate disrespect.

"Enough," Evadne cut in. "Grandpa’s here tonight. Let’s just enjoy dinner."

Just then, Jason hurried over, whispering, "Mr. Avery has arrived."

Thaddeus's expression darkened.

Evadne frowned. "Guide him to the Chambers’ table."

Jason hesitated. "Mrs. Chambers is with him."

Evadne stood immediately. "She’s here?"

Without another word, she followed Jason out.

Thaddeus watched her go, his grip tightening around his glass until his knuckles turned white.

The warmth beside him vanished, leaving only bitterness in its wake.
###Chapter 315

The grand banquet hall doors stood open, revealing the glittering world inside.

Avery Chambers wasn't dressed in the flashy designer suits his brothers favored. Instead, he wore a tailored dark gray suit, simple yet refined. His short hair was neatly styled, and the gold-rimmed glasses perched on his nose gave his deep brown eyes an intellectual air.

"Darling, let's go home. I don't like it here." Mrs. Chambers clutched the sleeve of his jacket, her voice trembling.

She looked stunning in an elegant lavender gown, her hair pinned up with a priceless jade hairpin. A delicate set of pearl jewelry adorned her neck and ears—custom pieces gifted by the royal family of Helgen, more valuable than diamonds.

To Avery, she was everything.

He wanted to give her the world.

Avery smiled gently, squeezing her hand. "Don't be afraid, Mother. I'm right here."

"But—"

"I brought you tonight because I knew you wanted to see Evadne. Didn't you say just yesterday how much you missed her?"

"Evadne?" Mrs. Chambers brightened instantly, her eyes lighting up. "Oh! Evadne! I get to see Evadne!"

Avery turned, and there she was—Evadne Ashbourne, walking toward them. Warmth flooded his chest, and his lips curved into an uncontrollable smile.

"Evadne."

"Mrs. Chambers!"

Evadne hurried forward, taking the older woman's hands with a delighted grin. "I had no idea you were coming! This is such a wonderful surprise!"

"I'm so happy to see you, dear!"

Mrs. Chambers adored Evadne. She pulled her into a tight hug before rummaging through her purse. "Here! I brought chocolates for you! Last time, you loved them, didn't you?"

Evadne accepted the candies, touched. "You remembered. Thank you."

She had seen battlefields and bloodshed, but it was these small, tender moments that moved her most.

"You look absolutely radiant tonight," Evadne said warmly.

"Do I?" Mrs. Chambers blushed like a schoolgirl. "My son picked this outfit. I usually just wear house clothes, so all this finery feels strange."

"You're stunning," Evadne assured her before glancing at Avery. "You have excellent taste."

Avery's breath hitched. His pulse roared like crashing waves.

"The Chambers family is already seated—Jeff and my father are at the same table. Let me take you over."

Evadne started to guide them when Avery stopped her. "Wait."

She turned, puzzled. "Yes?"

"You know our situation. My mother and I lost our place in the Chambers Group years ago. We were exiled to Helgen for fifteen years. I was just a boy, and she... wasn't well." His voice was rough, as if the words scraped his throat.

Evadne listened, picturing a young boy caring for his ailing mother. The thought left a bitter taste in her mouth.

"So I don’t want to sit with them. And I don’t want my mother subjected to their company either."

When Evadne didn’t respond, Avery assumed she disagreed. His smile turned wry. "If it’s uncomfortable for you, we’ll leave. I’ve seen you, and I’ve delivered Myra’s gifts. That’s enough."

"Ave, you’re overcomplicating things."

Evadne wouldn’t refuse them. "We’ll all sit together. It’s just a family dinner. No pressure."

Relief washed over Avery’s face. His brown eyes crinkled. "Thank you."

As they entered the banquet hall, Byron Chambers nearly choked on his wine. "Matthew! Look—it’s her!"

Matthew swirled his glass, his gaze flicking toward the entrance.

Avery and Evadne walked side by side, laughing. Matthew’s jaw tightened.

He’s getting too close.

"Persistent men always win over shy women," Byron sneered. "Our little brother is shameless! The deal isn’t even done, and he’s already playing servant. If they marry, he’ll be her lapdog!"

Elva shot him a disgusted look. Hard to believe he was a Chambers heir.

"Father wanted you to marry Evadne," Matthew said coldly. "If this continues, your future wife will be your sister-in-law."

"I won’t grovel like him!"

Matthew leaned in, voice low. "If persistence earns you billions, elevates your status, and secures power—would you still refuse?"

Byron fell silent.

"Act now, or everything we’ve worked for will be wasted." Matthew’s eyes darkened. "If he marries into the Ashbourne family, especially with Emeric’s favorite daughter, he’ll become unstoppable."

Byron’s grip on his glass tightened.

Meanwhile, Evadne led Avery and Mrs. Chambers to the Ashbourne table.

"Mrs. Chambers! You’re back from Helgen!" Suri and Aviana greeted her warmly.

"Who are these people?" Mrs. Chambers whispered to Avery.

He introduced them patiently. "This is Chairman Emeric’s wife, Suri, and Myra. These are Evadne’s siblings. That’s Jareth Fairhaven and his lovely companion, Mari."

Jareth, initially annoyed by Avery’s presence, preened at being called "lovely."

Men were so easily flattered.

Cassius stood, ever the gentleman. The Ashbourne siblings followed suit—even if they disliked Avery, they’d never show it publicly.

Only Thaddeus remained seated, his icy glare fixed on Avery, body coiled like a spring.

He didn’t introduce me.

Deliberate disrespect.

"There are so many people," Mrs. Chambers fretted. "I can’t remember them all!"

"Don’t worry," Evadne reassured her. "We’re all friends here. Please, sit."

But there was only one empty seat.

"Mother, you and Evadne take it. I’ll find another table," Avery offered.

"No!" Mrs. Chambers clung to him. "I won’t sit alone!"

The table exchanged glances.

"Suri," Aviana murmured, "does Mrs. Chambers seem... off?"

"Emeric mentioned she has Alzheimer’s. It’s progressed quite far."

"How tragic."

Seeing Mrs. Chambers’ distress, Avery looked helplessly at Evadne.

"Mr. Thaddeus."

Evadne tapped his shoulder. "Would you mind giving up your seat?"

Thaddeus looked up, eyes blazing. "Why should I move for him?"

Jareth stifled a laugh.

Petty.

"It’s not about him. Mrs. Chambers needs to stay with her son. Since you’re the only one who can move..."

"I won’t."

"Fine. Then I’ll go to another table!"

Panicked, Thaddeus nearly stood—but Cassius intervened.

"Evadne, Mr. Thaddeus is our guest. I’ll move."

With that, Cassius gracefully excused himself.

Avery’s jaw clenched.

He’s making me look ungrateful.

Thaddeus exhaled in relief.

Thank you, brother-in-law.

The banquet began at last.

Since Evadne hadn’t seen Debby in ages, she seated her beside herself—forcing Avery to sit next to Debby instead. His disappointment was palpable.

"Debby, Mr. Avery just returned from Helgen too. You must have much to discuss."

"Really? How long were you there?" Debby asked.

"Fifteen years."

"Then you’re practically a local! I’ve only been married there three years."

"What business were you in?"

Avery smiled. "Import-export."

Thaddeus cut in, voice razor-sharp. "What exactly did you import?"

Avery’s fist clenched under the table.

"Unless it’s classified," Thaddeus added, icy gaze dissecting him. "Or perhaps your business dealings aren’t fit for polite company?"
###Chapter 316

The tension was palpable as Isabella Sinclair stole a wary glance at Alexander Kingsley.

What game was he playing now?

The air between them crackled with unspoken hostility.

"Just standard merchandise. I'm merely conducting routine business," Nathaniel Prescott adjusted his glasses, his polished features masking simmering irritation beneath a practiced smile. "Mr. Kingsley, your imagination is truly remarkable. Even if you harbor prejudices against me, you shouldn't recklessly speculate about someone's integrity or belittle their accomplishments."

Alexander smirked, his lips curling with quiet amusement.

"Our paths diverge, Mr. Kingsley. You've had the privilege of the Kingsley Group's legacy—a prodigy in the corporate world, the anointed heir of Mr. Reginald. Someone like you, born with a silver spoon, could never comprehend the struggles of an entrepreneur starting from nothing."

Isabella listened, her long lashes fluttering as she sipped her champagne. Forgotten memories resurfaced in her mind.

No one understood better than her that Alexander's position in the Kingsley Group was far from the effortless ascent Nathaniel implied.

His journey had been anything but smooth.

"I didn't expect a casual inquiry to provoke such a passionate defense, Mr. Prescott. My apologies if I've made you uncomfortable. Consider the rumors I heard in Helgen just that—gossip."

Alexander chuckled, his striking face radiating an intimidating aura, his dark eyes burning with intensity. "And you're mistaken about one thing. I don't hold any prejudice against you—except when you get too close to Isabella. Then, my distrust is absolute. From head to toe. Inside and out."

Nathaniel clenched his jaw, his aristocratic features tightening.

Deborah, caught between them, suppressed a delighted grin, her high status preventing her from openly enjoying their verbal sparring. She bit her lip, stifling her laughter.

This homecoming was turning out to be far more entertaining than she'd anticipated.

"Alexander, have you said enough?"

Isabella had reached her limit, her sharp gaze slicing into the man beside her. "One more word, and I swear I'll smack you with a baseball bat."

Alexander's breath hitched, his hand on the table curling into a fist.

Then, slowly, he reached for her, his fingers grazing the delicate curve of her wrist, his rough fingertips brushing against her soft skin.

"Isabella, I was wrong. Can you forgive me?"

He was devastatingly handsome, shamelessly clingy, and unbearably sweet.

Who could resist him?

The warmth of his touch sent tingles up her arm, wrapping around her racing heart like a vine.

Seeing her silence, Alexander grew more desperate, leaning closer, his voice husky with pleading. "Or hit me with that bat if it makes you feel better—just wait until we're home. I may not mean much to you, but I still have a reputation to uphold. Spare me some dignity, Miss Sinclair?"

Deborah barely contained her laughter, thoroughly entertained.

"You—just sit there and behave!" Isabella huffed, turning away.

Alexander's gaze lingered on her pouting lips, his heart aching with longing.

At thirty, he was still helpless against her every word and expression, like a lovestruck teenager.

The stage lights dimmed.

A spotlight descended, illuminating the platform.

The announcer's voice boomed.

"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience! Please welcome tonight's star—Mrs. Seraphina!"

The crowd erupted into thunderous applause and cheers.

"Seraphina! Seraphina!" Isabella clapped, her hands reddening from the force.

From the shadows, Emeric, resplendent in a tailored tuxedo, led Seraphina onto the stage.

"Damn! Dad looks incredible!" Aaron exclaimed, admiring his father's youthful energy.

"Dressed like that, you'd think he's getting remarried tonight!" Arnold added excitedly.

"Remarried? At this rate, he'd be on his fifth wedding!"

Jareth teased, his fingers entwined with Marie's under the table. "At least it's still countable on one hand."

Two icy glares immediately shot his way—from Suri and Aviana.

Jareth quickly retreated, not daring to push further.

Hungry, Arnold stealthily grabbed a slice of cake, stuffing it into his mouth when no one was looking.

Camille, at the neighboring table, caught him red-handed.

"Mr. Arnold, are you stealing food?"

Startled, Arnold choked on the cake, coughing violently.

Camille burst into laughter at the sight of his flushed face as he gulped water, clutching his chest.

This woman—first wrecking his car, now nearly suffocating him—was clearly sent by fate to torment him.

"I'm eating at my own party, in my own hotel. How is that stealing?" Arnold snapped, irritated.

"Even so, the elders haven't started yet. Where are your manners?"

Camille leaned back, her laughter playful and teasing.

She reminded him of his little sister.

His annoyance faded at the sound of her mirth. It wasn't worth it.

"Look at Seraphina's black and red gown! Isn't it stunning?"

"Absolutely mesmerizing! She's a vision!"

Every guest's attention was riveted on Seraphina, captivated by her dress. Alexander couldn't help but glance at her, his pupils contracting in shock.

That dazzling gown—wasn't it the one Isabella had designed in Camille's studio?

"My God, am I seeing things?"

Someone suddenly stood, exclaiming, "Isn't this a Haron original?"

"What? Haron?"

"I can't believe I'm witnessing a Haron creation in my lifetime! I could die happy!"

"I'd kill to touch it!"

"Only the Sinclair family could pull this off. Haron hasn't been seen in years, yet she emerges to design a birthday gown for Seraphina! Chairman Emeric's influence is unmatched!"

"Meanwhile, the Abernathy matriarch celebrating her birthday tonight? Even if she begged, Haron wouldn't design for her."

Alexander's eyes widened in disbelief as he turned to Isabella, who wore a faint smile.

Shock and awe flooded his expression.

So, she was Haron.

Not just Alea—but Haron too.

Alexander's breath grew ragged, his nerves electrified.

How could one person possess so many extraordinary talents, each revered worldwide?

His woman was nothing short of divine.

Isabella felt his burning gaze and met his eyes, startled by their intensity.

"Why are you staring at me like that? Rabies acting up?" she quipped.

"I never imagined you were Haron," Alexander murmured, utterly captivated.

"Is it really that surprising? It's not like you're meeting Haron for the first time."

Isabella laughed dismissively, shifting her gaze from his tense face. "Alea crafted a tie pin for you. Haron tailored your suits."

Alexander's heart clenched, his eyes darkening with regret.

He had worn that tie pin daily.

Every night, he'd sit alone, polishing it meticulously, treasuring it as she must have treasured him while making it.

"Yeah, well, who I was never mattered to you. My gifts—like me—were left to gather dust."

Isabella propped her chin on her hand, watching the stage with unspoken melancholy.

"Isabella, I was wrong. I failed you. But now, I'd defy the world before failing you again." Alexander's voice was raw with sincerity. "I know earning your trust won't be easy. You may never give me another chance. But I won't stop trying—not until my heart does."

"Alexander, some things can't be undone. Some eggs can't be unscrambled."

Isabella finally looked at him, her gaze cool and detached.

"Even if it were possible, it wouldn't be the same. It'd be a mess. A disaster."

The party reached its peak as Seraphina's gown stole the spotlight.

Guests discreetly photographed her, and within minutes, the news of Haron designing for Seraphina trended globally.

[Seraphina, Emeric's wife—a has-been actress? How does she rate a Haron original?]

[That black and red gown is breathtaking!]

[Why not? Seraphina was a TV legend! My parents still adore her!]

[True fan here—age showing.]

[Please, she's just a mistress who popped out a kid for Emeric. Does she deserve Haron's artistry?]

[Stay bitter! That "mistress" lifestyle is worth billions! I'd wife up as number five if it meant that life!]

The comment racked up thousands of likes.

[The world's gone mad.]

[Love can't compete with money.]

[Meanwhile, Elspeth Abernathy's birthday is a ghost town. No glamorous gown, no guests—just humiliation. A mistress outshining the wife! Pathetic.]

[Haron would never design for a schemer like Elspeth. It'd tarnish her legacy.]

Isabella monitored the buzz, sending a voice note to Jason.

"Keep PR on standby. Suppress any negativity about Seraphina. Monitor comments every five minutes."

"Yes, Miss Sinclair."

"And keep the hype alive for now."

Jason hesitated. "But Chairman Emeric and Seraphina wanted a low-key celebration."

Isabella sighed.

They underestimated Haron's influence.

Her designs always caused a sensation.

The fashion world worshipped her.

Now that Seraphina wore a Haron original, the frenzy was inevitable. Why not let her have the grand birthday she deserved?

Plus, it served Elspeth right.

That clown must be seething.

Hilarious.

"Damn that Seraphina! That witch!"

In the hotel's presidential suite, Elspeth hurled anything within reach, her rage unquenched. Finally, she smashed a crystal ashtray into the massive TV, shattering it.

"Mom! Calm down!" Glynnis trembled, pale with fear.

"Calm down? That nobody is wearing a Haron gown! How dare she?"

Elspeth's sanity frayed, her eyes wild with fury.

One thought consumed her.

She wanted Seraphina dead.
###Chapter 317

"Mother, please, you must calm down," Seraphina pleaded, her voice shaking as she carefully approached the furious Arabella.

"Mother, seeing you like this—it's tearing me apart. Tell me what I can do to help," Seraphina offered, her tone thick with worry.

"Help? Can you kill Valentina for me?" Arabella spat, her voice dripping with venom.

Seraphina fell silent.

"I thought when Valentina ran off with Alexander, she'd just be his dirty little secret—nothing more than a mistress with no status. But then she had that girl, that wretched little thing!"

Seraphina had to stifle a laugh. After all, hadn't Arabella herself given birth to two daughters?

"But no. Alexander spoils her! Throwing her a lavish birthday party, even commissioning Nathaniel to design her a dress! Why is she so fortunate? Why does she get to outshine me?"

Arabella's rage had turned her face a deep, mottled red, her eyes brimming with furious tears. Valentina's success only highlighted Arabella's own failures.

"Mother, staying angry won't solve anything. We need to find a way to humiliate Valentina—maybe even ruin her birthday party," Seraphina suggested, gripping Arabella's arm urgently.

Arabella clenched her jaw, snatched up her phone, and dialed a number, stepping away to take the call by the window. "Arabella, it's been a while. How have you been?"

A rough, masculine voice answered—likely belonging to a middle-aged man.

"Let's just say I've had better days," Arabella choked out, struggling to keep her voice steady.

"Is this about that woman, Valentina?"

"Who else would it be?"

"Arabella, you once did me a favor, and I haven't forgotten. Tell me what you need."

Arabella let out a quiet sob, but her eyes gleamed with something far darker than grief.

Nathaniel's custom-designed evening gown had been the centerpiece of Valentina's birthday celebration, but the night was far from over. The next event was the gift presentation.

Everyone expected Alexander to present Valentina with something extravagant—a property deed, perhaps, or rare jewels. But what he gave her was entirely unexpected.

Alexander had established a charity foundation in Valentina's name, dedicated to supporting children with disabilities. And as the final touch, Valentina herself was appointed as the foundation's chairwoman.

Isabella's heart swelled with pride. The women of the Sinclair family weren't like other socialites. They—including Alexander—had never cared for material wealth.

Compared to the most dazzling diamond in the world, this foundation was the perfect gift for Valentina, who had secretly spent years donating and volunteering to help underprivileged children.

She had done it all without the family's knowledge, believing Alexander was unaware. Little did she know, he had known all along—and had been planning this surprise for months.

"I know how much charity means to you, Valentina. You've anonymously helped so many children over the years. I thought this would be the most meaningful gift I could give you," Alexander said, his gaze tender as he took her hand.

"Alexander... how did you know?" Valentina's voice trembled on the verge of tears.

"No tears, my love. Not today."

Alexander smiled gently, brushing away a stray tear from her cheek.

"As an initial donation, I'm contributing fifty million to the foundation. I hope everyone here will join me in supporting the Valentina Foundation. On behalf of Sinclair Holdings, I thank you all in advance," Alexander announced, his commanding presence silencing the room.

A stunned hush fell before the crowd erupted into applause.

"Alexander didn't give Valentina some flashy gift—he donated fifty million to her charity. That's incredible!"

"Most high-society birthday gifts are predictable. Alexander's is not only original but meaningful. It elevates Valentina's reputation and the Sinclair family's standing. A masterstroke!"

At a nearby table, Harrison, Nathaniel, and Sebastian sat together.

"That old man," Nathaniel muttered jealously. "What kind of sorcery is he using? Why doesn't he age?"

He turned to Sebastian beside him. "Sebastian, what's your father's secret? He looks younger every year. Tell me."

"Just good lighting," Sebastian replied with a faint smile.

"Ha! I knew it!" Nathaniel leaned in eagerly. "Where does he get his makeup done? It's flawless. Can you introduce me?"

Sebastian could only sigh.

Harrison chuckled under his breath.

The Sinclair family sat at their table, clapping enthusiastically, their faces alight with joy.

Amid the celebration, Lillian found herself blinking back tears. Seeing her mother so happy and loved overwhelmed her.

"Lillian, why are you crying?" Eleanor asked softly, concern in her eyes.

"Mother, I'm just... so happy for Valentina," Lillian sniffled, dabbing at her eyes with a tissue.

A wave of warmth filled Eleanor as she gently stroked her daughter's silken hair.

In their large, complex family, all her children—including Isabella—called her Eleanor. Only the youngest, Lillian, still called her "Mother."

It was a small thing, but it meant the world to her.

"You should be happy," Eleanor reassured her.

"But I've always thought Father didn't have room in his heart for you," Lillian confessed, her emotions tangled. "And I'm the biggest disappointment among his children. Your daughter is destined to be the future First Lady of Helgen, my sister is a star in the design world and helps manage his hotels. And me? I can't do anything. I'm just... useless."

"Lillian, don't say that," Eleanor murmured, pulling her close. "Your father has said many times that he only wants you—the youngest Sinclair—to live freely. To him, success doesn't matter. Happiness does. And he loves you deeply. Just because he doesn't say it doesn't mean he doesn't feel it. Actions speak louder than words, don't they?"

Lillian nodded, resting her head against Eleanor's shoulder as fresh tears glistened in her eyes.

Then, the guests began presenting their gifts—each more extravagant than the last.

"Next, a gift from Mr. Adrian of the Vanderbilt Group!" the host announced.

All eyes turned to Adrian, illuminated by a spotlight.

Even Isabella glanced over, curious.

"He prepared a gift in secret?" Dominic muttered through gritted teeth. "Always trying to win favor with the Sinclairs. Always stealing the spotlight!"

"What's the point?" Oliver scoffed, swirling his wine. "Adrian's clever, but he doesn't realize he's already angered Father. The Vanderbilt Group is still under Father's control."

As predicted, Reginald did not look pleased.

His jaw tightened as he glared at Adrian.

Then, his gaze shifted to Mrs. Vanderbilt, and his lips twitched.

Adrian's gift was brought forward, and the room fell silent in anticipation.

Valentina hesitated, glancing at Alexander.

"It's a token of respect. Let's see what it is," Alexander suggested, slipping an arm around Valentina's waist as they lifted the covering cloth together.

In an instant, Alexander's expression darkened. His eyes flicked toward Adrian, unreadable.

When the guests saw the gift, gasps of awe rippled through the crowd. It was no less shocking than Nathaniel's dress.

Isabella's brows furrowed. Her pulse quickened.

Beneath the cloth was a porcelain vase—an antique so rare it could belong in a museum. At auction, it would easily fetch three million dollars.

Adrian presenting such an extravagant gift to Valentina—one that surpassed even Reginald's—was a blatant insult to his father.

Isabella shook her head. And then she realized—Sebastian was missing.

Her heart skipped a beat as she scanned the room for him.

"Valentina," Adrian began with a respectful bow, "this is my birthday gift to you—a Ming dynasty porcelain vase. May you and Chairman Alexander enjoy a long, happy, and healthy life together."

Valentina was stunned. "Mr. Adrian, this is too generous."

"It is," Alexander said lightly, though his tone carried an edge. "If I didn't know better, I'd think it was a gift for me."

Adrian adjusted his glasses, his smile unreadable.

"A Ming dynasty vase!"

"That's a million-dollar antique!"

"Adrian never attends Vanderbilt family events, yet here he is, making such a grand gesture. Remarkable!"

"But isn't it inappropriate that his gift overshadows Reginald's?"

Indeed, it was. Reginald's face had turned an alarming shade of green.

What they didn't know was that this seemingly ill-timed move was calculated. And it was only the beginning.

The Vanderbilts' troubles were just starting.

"Next, a gift from Mr. Sebastian, president of the Abernathy Group!" the host announced.
###Chapter 318

Evadne jolted upright, her pulse racing as her eyes locked onto the stage.

Debby, seated closest to her, immediately noticed the shift in her sister's demeanor and the sudden intensity in her gaze.

The crowd's attention swiftly diverted from Avery back to the spectacle unfolding before them.

"Look! This is from my grandson, my very own grandson!" Hamilton beamed, enthusiastically patting Cassius on one shoulder and Jeff on the other.

He'd known his grandson wouldn't let him down. "That sly Chambers boy wasn't about to steal the spotlight, was he?" Hamilton thought smugly. "Tell me, Jeff, doesn't your youngest have his eye on our Evadne?" His snowy eyebrows danced mischievously.

"Our Evadne?" Jeff echoed, perplexed.

"I mean Evadne. That's what I call her—force of habit," Hamilton corrected with a chuckle.

Jeff pressed his lips together, his expression inscrutable. "My youngest has always marched to his own beat. I can't claim to understand his thoughts."

"You don't?" Hamilton laughed heartily. "On Myra's birthday, your boy pulls out a three-million-dollar antique. If that's not courting Emeric's favor, what is? Seems he's set his sights on Evadne."

"The younger generation's affairs are... complicated," Jeff replied stiffly.

"Be that as it may, I'll say my piece." Hamilton reclined comfortably, triumph gleaming in his eyes. "Evadne will end up with my grandson. So Jeff, my advice? Tell your boy there are plenty of eligible ladies out there. With Avery's talents and looks, he'll find someone more suitable. No sense wasting time on what he can't have."

Jeff could only muster an awkward smile in response.

Even Cassius beside him couldn't conceal his surprise, his lips quirking slightly.

Mr. Hamilton, ever the strategist. It was clear why he'd been such a formidable force in his youth.

In the shadows, a handsome face darkened with icy displeasure.

He'd anticipated Thaddeus would present a gift, but not this grand gesture. It had caught him completely off guard!

At that moment, the host brought forth another tray draped in crimson silk, placing it ceremoniously on the display table.

Simultaneously, measured footsteps approached from behind Avery.

With a cold glance, he turned to see Thaddeus making his entrance—composed, dignified, every inch the aristocrat.

"Mrs. Myra, this is my birthday gift to you," Thaddeus announced, taking his place beside Avery. His chiseled features seemed carved from marble, his eyes sparkling with genuine warmth. "Wishing you the happiest of birthdays."

His courtesy was impeccable, his bearing that of true nobility.

Hamilton couldn't suppress his grin. His grandson had clearly outshone that bespectacled upstart!

Evadne studied Thaddeus, her emotions a turbulent sea.

What intrigued her most was what this infuriating man had chosen for Myra.

Avery had set the bar astronomically high with his rare antique. What could Thaddeus possibly present to surpass that?

"Thank you for your kind wishes, Mr. Thaddeus. We're honored by your presence tonight," Myra responded graciously, her warmth enveloping the room.

Emeric observed Thaddeus with a sardonic smile. Outwardly composed, inwardly seething.

After all, this was the man who'd broken his precious Evadne's heart.

Yet here he stood, bold as brass at an Ashbourne family event.

The audacity was almost impressive.

"My gift isn't particularly valuable, but it comes from the heart. I hope it pleases you, Mrs. Myra," Thaddeus said with quiet dignity.

Evadne rested her chin on her hand, watching him with amusement.

The usually aloof Thaddeus was showing an unexpectedly charming side.

She had to admit—he was quite the performer.

"Since it's a token of Mr. Thaddeus's sincerity, let's see it," Emeric said airily, as though granting a favor.

Myra hid a smile. His dislike for Thaddeus was practically genetic.

Noticing Emeric's expression, Avery smirked.

No matter how Thaddeus tried to ingratiate himself, it was futile. He'd wounded Evadne deeply—and in doing so, alienated the entire Ashbourne clan.

Some breaches were irreparable.

Together, Myra and Emeric lifted the crimson cloth.

Inside the crystal case lay a golden phoenix crown, adorned with lustrous pearls.

Myra's eyes widened, her hand flying to her mouth as she fought back tears.

"Myrie? Are you all right?" Emeric asked softly, squeezing her hand.

Myra quickly composed herself, though her eyes still shimmered. "Emeric... I love Mr. Thaddeus's gift. Truly, I do."

Her heartfelt words echoed through the banquet hall, stunning everyone—including Evadne!

She couldn't fathom why this crown, which looked more like an elaborate prop than a priceless artifact, had moved Myra so deeply.

"Myrie, I don't understand," Emeric admitted.

Myra didn't explain immediately. Instead, she turned to Thaddeus, eyes shining. "Mr. Thaddeus, might I ask where you found this?"

"It's quite a story," Thaddeus replied solemnly. "After extensive searching, I located it with a retired prop master who'd kept it all these years. He refused to sell—until learning it was for your birthday. Then he gave it freely."

Myra's breath caught. "Is it from... 'Love In A Fallen City'?"

Thaddeus nodded. "Indeed."

Myra covered her mouth, overwhelmed.

Evadne quickly searched the series on her phone.

It was a wildly popular drama from over two decades ago—the role that made Myra a star!

The iconic queen Myra portrayed had worn this very crown.

"Of course!" Evadne murmured, her gaze softening toward Thaddeus.

However much she disliked him, she couldn't deny the thoughtfulness of his gift.

He'd clearly gone to great lengths to find something so meaningful to Myra.

Emeric, listening quietly, was visibly moved. His hostility toward Thaddeus faded. "Well done, Thaddeus. This was exceptionally considerate."

"You honor me, Chairman Emeric," Thaddeus replied, his heart soaring.

Tonight, sleep would be impossible—he'd be floating on cloud nine!

Avery watched Thaddeus's triumph, fury rising like a tide.

He prided himself on cunning, yet Thaddeus had outmaneuvered him with a mere gift!

"There's more," Thaddeus added, his smile radiant. "My grandfather and I wish to donate thirty million dollars to the Myra Foundation."

Gasps filled the room.

Thirty million!

The Abernathy Group certainly knew how to make a statement.

Emeric's sharp eyes gleamed with approval.

Avery had been thoroughly eclipsed.

Seeing an opening, Jeff raised his hand casually. "I'll donate as well—forty million, if I may."

Cheers erupted. "How generous!"

If Abernathy acted, Chambers couldn't lag behind!

"Much obliged!" Emeric laughed, waving at him.

"Forty million? That's outrageous!" Byron grumbled.

"To Father, it's worth it to salvage Avery's dignity," Matthew observed, watching Avery's pallid face with amusement.

After presenting their gifts, Thaddeus and Avery returned to their seats.

"Mr. Thaddeus, I underestimated your cunning. My compliments," Avery said coldly, adjusting his gold-rimmed glasses. "This round is yours—but only this one."

"Choose your words carefully, Mr. Avery." Thaddeus lifted his chin, his handsome face imperious. "You didn't 'let' me win. You lost."

"Thaddeus." Avery's jaw clenched, his eyes darkening—he despised losing.

"But do you know why you lost, despite your efforts?" Thaddeus's gaze was calm, his lips curving in a beautiful, mocking smile. "However cunning I may be, it's only to win Evadne's heart. Your motives... aren't so pure."

With that, Thaddeus strode away.

Avery's breath came harshly, his expression savage.

The banquet continued in high spirits.

Pleased with his victory, Thaddeus slipped out for a celebratory smoke.

He hadn't gone far when a voice stopped him cold.

"Thaddeus!"

He turned swiftly.

Evadne approached, her stilettos clicking rhythmically, her movements graceful as a summer breeze.

Her luminous eyes sparkled, her glossy hair swayed, her lips like a midnight rose.

Suddenly, desire overwhelmed him.

He longed to pull her into his arms, to hold her, to kiss her.

In moments, she stood before him.

Their gazes locked, the air between them charged with unspoken electricity.

No words were needed—the tension was palpable.

"I didn't expect your gift to be the highlight of Myra's evening," Evadne said lightly, her eyes dancing. "Among all the presents, yours clearly moved her most. You've outshone even me."

"What?" Thaddeus blanched, hastily explaining. "I only thought she'd appreciate it. I never meant to—Evadne, I'm sorry, I didn't intend to overshadow you. You're her family—she must cherish your gift above all."

"Stop apologizing!" Evadne frowned impatiently, her lips pursing. "How many times must I say it? Your constant 'sorries' make me feel like a bully! I came to thank you."

Thaddeus stared, stunned.

Her anger he could handle—her blows, her temper.

But gratitude? That left him reeling.

"It's been ages since I've seen Myra so genuinely happy," Evadne admitted, her smile soft. "For that, thank you."

"Family means everything to you. That's beautiful." Thaddeus gazed at her tenderly, his affection plain.

Evadne's heart skipped. Emotions surged within her.

'You used to be everything to me too,' she thought.

"Evadne, come with me." Suddenly, Thaddeus took her hand. "I have something for you."
###Chapter 319

Sebastian's fingers intertwined with Isabella's as they rushed down the opulent, empty hallway.

They were like two rebellious aristocrats, defying society's expectations, shattering conventions—embarking on a thrilling escape.

Isabella, mesmerized by the man's broad shoulders and striking profile, felt an unfamiliar warmth spread through her chest. Her pulse quickened. Her palms grew damp.

At this moment, she couldn't deny it—she was falling for him all over again.

And she hated herself for it.

For falling for him ten years ago. Five years ago. And now, just because he held her hand.

How infuriating! He didn’t deserve this!

Sebastian, pleased with himself, guided her swiftly through the corridor before stopping in front of an extravagant suite.

Flustered, Isabella yanked her hand free, cheeks burning. "Sebastian! What are you scheming? Do you really think I won’t call my brothers and have them tear you apart?"

Sebastian chuckled, amused by her assumption. "Where is your mind wandering, Isabella? I just stored your gift in here."

Isabella blinked, lips pursed like a delicate rosebud, her face flushing deeper.

"Even if all your brothers came at me, I could handle them," he murmured, stepping closer. His voice dropped, teasing yet restrained. "But I'd rather behave. For now."

Isabella turned away sharply. "I'd rather die than go back to your place!"

"Windermere was never my home, Isabella," Sebastian said softly, a shadow crossing his eyes. "I don’t have one."

Her chest tightened.

"Only with you could I ever have a home," he admitted, voice rough with emotion. "Without you, I’d rather stay lost."

Isabella met his gaze, slow and deliberate, like a patient who had endured too much pain.

The look shattered him.

He had been too reckless. Too impatient. He shouldn’t have said it.

"You were in the military once, weren’t you?" Isabella asked abruptly. "A peacekeeper."

Sebastian tensed, sensing danger.

"Those years you spent wandering—you know exactly why you were exiled." Her voice was sharp. "And it wasn’t for me."

The words struck like a blade.

He couldn’t escape this.

Sebastian’s lips parted, but no sound came out.

Then—a soft click.

The door swung open, breaking the suffocating tension.

"Mr. Sebastian! Miss Sinclair!"

Gordon stood there, grinning. "I heard voices and thought I’d check."

Neither spoke.

"Did I... interrupt something?" Gordon swallowed, sensing the icy atmosphere.

"No."

Isabella strode inside, expression cool, avoiding Sebastian’s gaze.

Sebastian followed, lips pressed into a thin line.

Gordon hesitated, but Sebastian shut the door in his face with a curt, "Stay out."

Gordon snapped to attention. "Yes, sir!"

Inside, Isabella’s breath caught.

On the coffee table sat an exquisite ebony box—antique, priceless.

Her fingers itched to touch it.

"It’s stunning," she whispered.

"Don’t just admire the box," Sebastian murmured, stepping behind her. "Open it."

His attention was fixed on her—every flicker of emotion on her face.

Isabella wiped her damp palms on her dress, a nervous habit Sebastian found unbearably endearing.

Carefully, she lifted the lid.

Inside lay a breathtaking porcelain cup—delicate pink and celestial blue, a masterpiece of craftsmanship.

Isabella gasped, hands flying to her mouth.

Even her father’s private collection lacked something this rare.

"I found it three months ago in Aetheria," Sebastian said, watching her. "Negotiations were... intense. But seeing your smile now? Worth every second."

"It’s perfect," she breathed, eyes shining.

Too awed to touch it, she hovered her hands just above.

Sebastian’s arms encircled her from behind, his warmth seeping into her skin.

"You can touch it," he murmured, guiding her fingers with his.

His breath tickled her ear, sending heat rushing to her cheeks.

Their heartbeats synced. Shadows merged.

The air thickened with something intoxicating.

"Sebastian—"

Before she could protest, he pulled her flush against him, arms locking around her waist.

"Scold me later," he murmured.

Right now, he just needed to hold her.

Meanwhile, the ballroom buzzed with life.

The birthday girl, Seraphina, danced gracefully with her father, Reginald, under the glittering chandeliers.

Guests watched, enchanted.

Nathaniel swayed with his wife, Evelyn, while Adrian led a reluctant Lillian onto the floor.

"Adrian, I don’t dance!"

"I’ll teach you," he promised, hands gentle on her shoulders.

Lillian’s heart raced. "Really?"

"Really."

Elsewhere, the Lockwoods reveled in the festivities.

Vanessa, tipsy, twirled with her sister, laughing.

Margaret danced with her son, Dominic, much to Nathaniel’s amusement.

"Mom, dance with Dad or me. Why Dominic?"

Margaret scoffed. "Art isn’t for the unrefined."

The room erupted in laughter.

In a quiet corner, Camille sat alone, wineglass in hand.

Her eyes stung as she watched happy families around her.

"Miss Camille."

She looked up—Dominic stood before her, hand extended.

"May I have this dance?"

Camille accepted, but he noticed the glimmer in her eyes.

"Were you crying?"

"Yawning," she snapped.

Dominic played along. "Ah, my mistake."

"You are mistaken."

The room laughed again.

Camille seethed. "You must be blind—that’s why you hit my car."

"Oh, one more thing." Dominic spun her gracefully. "The police confirmed it was your fault."

Camille’s jaw dropped.

"And the insurance will call you tomorrow." He smirked. "Saving you the trouble."

What?

How dare he?!

Camille fantasized about stomping on his foot.

Across the room, Alexander lingered by his mother’s side, though his gaze kept searching.

Isabella was gone.

So was Sebastian.

His stomach twisted.

"Alexander, go find her," his mother urged, guilt in her eyes. "I know how you feel about her. Don’t waste this chance."

Alexander smiled gently. "There’s time, Mother."

Then—

"Alexander!"

His head snapped up, expression turning glacial.

His mother flinched at the voice, clinging to him.

"Alexander, come here. Now." His father’s tone was sharp.

Alexander didn’t move. "Father, are you blind? Your wife is right here."

The air turned to ice.
###Chapter 320

"You ungrateful brat! I'm your father—how dare you speak to me like that?" Nathan roared, his face turning crimson with rage.

If it weren't for the crowd of guests surrounding them, he would’ve slapped the insolence out of his son right then and there. In his generation, discipline was meted out with force—only the weak needed words. And this defiant little devil? He deserved to be stripped bare and whipped raw.

"If you show my mother the respect she deserves, I might pretend you're still my father. But if you keep insulting her, I won’t hold back."

Sebastian laughed, his lips curling into a mocking smile, but his eyes remained cold and hollow.

It was a laugh devoid of warmth, sharp as a blade—so chilling that even Nathan felt a shiver crawl down his spine.

The two men stood on the balcony, the night air thick with tension.

The winter chill was nothing compared to the frost between them.

"What the hell do you want?" Nathan demanded, his voice like ice.

"I didn’t realize my gift to Evelyn would overshadow yours. If you feel humiliated, then I apologize." Sebastian shrugged, feigning indifference. "Ignorance is bliss, isn’t it?"

"This isn’t about the damn gift!"

Nathan took a step forward, his knuckles white. "Why did you bring her here? To provoke me? To shame me in front of everyone?"

Sebastian burst into laughter, tears glistening in his eyes. "Oh, I thought this was serious. Turns out it’s just your fragile ego."

"Sebastian!" Nathan’s fists trembled.

"My mother—the woman you once vowed to love in sickness and health, till death do you part. Now, she’s nothing but an embarrassment to you?" Sebastian’s voice cracked with fury. "You abandoned her in Helgen for fifteen years without a second thought. Now that I can finally give her the life she deserves, all you do is sneer at her. I’ve tolerated your disrespect long enough."

"You insolent—!"

Nathan’s palm struck Sebastian’s cheek with a sharp crack.

A red mark bloomed across Sebastian’s pale skin, but his lips still curled into a smirk. "You’ve gotten weaker, Father. Are they not feeding you well?"

"Shut your mouth!"

Nathan’s finger shook as he pointed at his son. "Take her and leave. Now. Or I’ll have her dragged back to Helgen myself."

"Try it."

Sebastian’s hands clenched, veins bulging at his temples—a far cry from the composed gentleman he’d been moments ago. "Touch my mother tonight, and I’ll kill whoever lays a finger on her."

Nathan’s breath hitched.

The murderous glint in his son’s eyes was unmistakable.

"Every member of the Prescott family is welcome here—including my mother. And let’s not forget, Evelyn herself invited us. If you throw us out, you’re slapping her in the face. And if you offend her, good luck salvaging whatever deal you’re scheming for."

Sebastian turned to leave.

"I never wronged your mother! She betrayed me first!" Nathan exploded, his face red with fury. "If she hadn’t been unfaithful, if she hadn’t lost that child—she could’ve been the respected wife of Prescott Group’s chairman instead of a laughingstock!"

"My mother loved you. She would never have betrayed you."

Sebastian’s voice was raw with grief, his shoulders shaking. "I’ve told you a thousand times—it was Adrian, Harrison, and Margaret who framed her! You never investigated. You never listened. You just threw her away like trash. Marrying you was the worst mistake of her life!"

"I saw it with my own eyes! What more proof did I need?" Nathan snarled.

Every time he remembered that night, he wanted to strangle her.

And this bastard standing before him.

"Fool."

Sebastian scoffed and walked away.

He hadn’t meant to bring it up again—it only reopened his mother’s wounds. But the rage had boiled over.

He no longer expected Nathan to see the truth.

Because soon, the ones who’d orchestrated it would pay.

One by one.

In the dimly lit suite, the air was thick with tension.

Isabella struggled against the arms wrapped around her, her breath coming in short gasps. The heat of his body against hers was suffocating.

"Let go, or I swear I’ll hit you!"

Even her anger sounded breathless, her voice barely above a whisper.

"Isabella, would you really hurt me?" Alexander murmured against her neck, his voice rough with desire.

"You’re not mine. Why wouldn’t I?"

Her reply was cold, but the way her body trembled betrayed her.

Alexander’s grip tightened. "After everything I’ve done for you?"

Her chest burned.

He didn’t know—she had once saved him too.

When she didn’t respond, panic flickered in his eyes. "I’m sorry. I’m nothing but your dog. Your loyal, devoted dog."

Isabella bit her lip, fighting a laugh. Alexander Kingsley, the untouchable heir of Elmsworth, calling himself her dog? The women of this city would riot if they heard.

"Prove it," she challenged. "Bark for me."

It was cruel. But she didn’t care.

"Woof."

She froze.

He did it again, his cheeks flushed with humiliation.

If it made her happy, he’d bark all night.

"Alexander, have you lost your mind?"

"I don’t want to die," he whispered. "Because then I’d never see you again."

He turned her to face him, his dark eyes burning with emotion.

"Alexander—"

Before she could finish, he pulled off his tie and held it out to her.

"Take me home."

She stared at the silk in his hand, stunned.

His gaze dropped to her lips as he leaned in—

Her phone rang.

She shoved him away and answered.

"Daniel? What’s wrong?"

"Miss Isabella, where are you?" His voice was frantic.

"At the hotel. What happened?"

"It’s Evelyn. Something terrible—"

"Tell me!"

Alexander tensed at the name.

"Old scandals about Evelyn just exploded online. Photos, videos—everything. It’s everywhere!"

Her stomach dropped. "How bad is the backlash?"

"Out of control!"

"Does Evelyn know?"

"Of course! And so does every reporter in the city. They’re swarming the hotel!"

Daniel was nearly shouting now. "Chairman Reginald is sending Evelyn and Ms. Eleanor home. He wants you to escort them to Skyrim. He and Mr. Harrison will stay to handle the fallout. If we all leave, it’ll look like we’re running."

"I’ll find them now. Track down who leaked this!"

When she saw the photos, her hands shook with rage.

"Isabella, what’s—?"

"Stay out of it!" she snapped.
###Chapter 321

Nathaniel was stunned, his outstretched hands frozen mid-air.

"I saw you were upset. I just wanted to—"

"Let me repeat myself. My business is none of yours!"

Isabella had no patience for male theatrics. She shoved past him, phone clutched in her grip, and sprinted away.

The door slammed shut behind her with a deafening crash.

Nathaniel felt the warmth between them vanish instantly. Everything that had just transpired—every tender moment—was nothing more than a fragile bubble, floating beautifully before she popped it without hesitation.

The priceless antique he'd gifted her? Left behind without a second glance.

To Isabella, family came first. Everything else was disposable.

A sharp pang twisted in his chest.

But now wasn’t the time for self-pity. He snapped into action, striding out of the room.

"Mr. Kingsley! Mrs. Sinclair just stormed out. What happened?" Preston asked, concern lacing his tone.

"Seraphina is in trouble," Nathaniel replied, his voice heavy.

"What? That explains the commotion earlier!"

Preston immediately pulled out his phone, fingers flying across the screen.

His expression darkened. "Mr. Kingsley, look at this!"

Nathaniel glanced down at the video playing on Preston’s phone.

His handsome face tensed instantly. He snatched the device, gripping it tightly.

The footage was grainy, years old, but unmistakable—Seraphina on stage, hands clutching her stomach as liquid trickled down her legs.

Gasps erupted from the audience.

Cameras flashed relentlessly, the blinding lights swallowing her whole.

"My mother was Seraphina’s biggest fan. She told me how her career ended in disgrace—drug rumors, and... this," Preston muttered, unable to watch. "Back then, the internet wasn’t widespread. Phones couldn’t record. But my mom saw it live on TV."

Nathaniel’s jaw clenched.

A woman at the peak of her fame, humiliated in front of thousands. It was worse than death.

"By the next morning, every newspaper headline was about the scandal. But within hours, they all vanished. Someone made them disappear."

Nathaniel’s eyes narrowed.

Of course. Chairman Reginald.

Only a man of his influence could erase a nationwide scandal overnight.

"Whoever leaked this planned it carefully. They’re powerful—and patient," Nathaniel muttered, his mind racing. "Either an insider from the TV station or someone involved in the original incident."

"Brilliant deduction, as always, sir!"

"Track down the source. Every journalist, every account that shared this—detain them. Now."

"Yes, sir!"

Without another word, Nathaniel turned on his heel and strode away.

"Mr. Kingsley! Where are you going?" Preston called after him.

Nathaniel didn’t look back. "Isabella’s facing hell for her family. I’m going to stand beside her."

It didn’t matter if she didn’t love him.

She was in his blood. That was enough.

——

The resurfaced scandal spread like wildfire.

Reporters descended on the Windsor Estates like vultures.

Online, the backlash was brutal.

[I’ve seen stars fall from grace, but this? Disgusting.]

[Did she really pee on stage? How pathetic.]

[Old-timers know the truth. Seraphina was a drug addict. That’s why she lost control.]

[Is this real?]

[Why would Chairman Reginald want her? The Sinclairs are elite. This is disgraceful.]

[Throwing a birthday party for a woman like this? The Sinclair heiress must be seething.]

Isabella sprinted toward the banquet hall, scrolling through the comments.

Her fingers trembled with rage.

Outside, Sebastian, Oliver, and William were locked in heated discussion.

"Isabella!" they called in unison.

"Where’s Seraphina? Is she okay?" she demanded, breathless.

"Dad sent bodyguards to escort her out," Sebastian said, stepping forward to wipe her sweat with his handkerchief.

She shoved his hand away. "How is she?"

The brothers exchanged glances.

"Pale. Shaking. Terrified," Oliver admitted. "Having this dredged up on her birthday? It’s cruel."

"Damn it!" William yanked at his hair. "I’m calling Cyber Security. We’ll find who did this!"

"Stop." Sebastian’s voice was steel. "You’re a public official. This is a private matter. Don’t abuse your power."

William froze, chastened.

A sudden crash silenced them.

Isabella had punched through the fire hydrant’s glass casing. Shards littered the floor.

"Oh my God! Isabella!"

Her brothers lunged forward, panic-stricken.

"You’re bleeding!" Oliver gasped, eyes wide.

"Call an ambulance!" William shouted.

Isabella scoffed. "It’s a scratch."

With a swift motion, she ripped off Oliver’s tie and wrapped it around her bleeding hand.

William whistled. "That was badass."

"Isabella, calm down," Sebastian pleaded, gripping her shoulders. "We’ll handle this together."

"Find who’s behind this. I’m getting Seraphina and Nydia home."

She spun on her heel and ran.

"Isabella! Your hand!" Oliver called uselessly.

"Let her go," Sebastian murmured. "She needs to do this."

——

Isabella didn’t stop for Chairman Reginald. She bolted to the parking garage.

"Miss Sinclair! You can’t go down there!" A bodyguard blocked her path.

"Move." Her glare was lethal.

"Mr. Sebastian’s orders. It’s chaos. Our team will secure their exit!"

"I don’t trust you."

She dodged them effortlessly.

Seconds later, she found her family surrounded by reporters.

"Mrs. Sinclair! Care to comment on the scandal?"

"Is the video real? Were the drug allegations true?"

The mob pressed closer, ravenous.

Nydia clung to Seraphina, while Arabella and Victoria shielded them, snarling at the press.

"Watch your words! We’ll sue for slander!" Arabella snapped.

"Seraphina is innocent!" Victoria added, though her voice shook with fury.

"Innocent?" A smirking reporter jeered. "I was there that night. I saw her wet herself on stage!"

The crowd erupted.

Wet herself.

The words hung in the air like a death sentence.

Who could reconcile the once-glamorous icon with such humiliation?

The scandal had just exploded all over again.
###Chapter 322

A ripple of muffled laughter spread through the gathered press corps.

Each venomous stare directed at Isabella carried its own poison—malice, mockery, disdain, loathing. The collective gaze felt like insects crawling under her skin, gnawing at her soul.

"Mom, don't be afraid. I've got you!"

Natalie wrapped her arms protectively around her mother, shielding her with her own body as she glared defiantly at the hostile crowd. The usually timid girl now stood fierce and unyielding. "No one's going to hurt you. Not on my watch!"

"It's alright... I'm alright," Isabella murmured dazedly, her once-bright eyes clouded with confusion.

Natalie's restraint finally broke. Tears spilled freely, soaking into her mother's hair.

"What did you just say? Repeat that!" Vanessa jabbed an accusatory finger at the male reporter, her face flushed with fury.

"Vanessa, this doesn't concern you. Why get so worked up?" another journalist sneered.

Sophia's brow furrowed. She saw their game clearly—these were planted troublemakers.

"Worked up? Isabella is family! Insulting her is insulting me!" Vanessa's chest heaved with barely contained rage, fingers itching to break the man's ribs.

"Family?" The reporter smirked knowingly. "Such a touching public display. But behind closed doors? We journalists know the truth. What woman wouldn't resent sharing a husband?"

Vanessa lunged, but Sophia clamped a hand over her mouth just in time.

As representatives of the Sinclair family, they couldn't afford impulsive actions that might embarrass Alexander and Sebastian.

"Vanessa, walk away. They're not worth it." Sophia steered her toward their waiting car.

The instigator smirked. "Running away? Just like Isabella fled the entertainment industry after that drug scandal? Some things never change—"

His words cut off as a blur streaked past.

Gasps erupted.

No one saw where Evelyn came from. Like lightning, she materialized before her family.

The reporter gaped at the Sinclair heiress's breathtaking beauty—an almost unnatural perfection that eclipsed every starlet he'd ever photographed.

Other women killed with their looks.

Evelyn was the weapon itself.

"Ten pounds of sewage couldn't make your breath smell worse."

Without waiting for a reply, Evelyn seized the man's collar with her left hand and delivered a stinging slap with her right.

The crisp sound silenced the crowd, including the Sinclairs.

"Evelyn..." Natalie stared in awe, admiration swelling.

"Hell yes, Evelyn!" Vanessa cheered, itching to join in.

Sophia barely restrained her.

"You—you assaulted me!" The reporter clutched his burning cheek in disbelief.

"A slap is just the beginning." Evelyn's voice remained ice-calm. "I'll sue you into oblivion for defaming my family. Being press doesn't give you license to slander. Think past victims' silence made you untouchable? Tonight, I'll show every gutter journalist what happens when you cross the Sinclairs."

Her commanding presence awed the crowd.

Even as the aggressor, her fearless beauty made it impossible to condemn her.

"Defamation?" The reporter scoffed. "That TV station scandal years ago—new reporters might not know, but we remember!"

"Memory isn't evidence." Evelyn's piercing gaze never wavered.

The man's confidence faltered.

"Cat got your tongue?" Evelyn glanced at his press badge. "Expect a lawsuit from Sinclair Holdings' legal team."

He paled visibly.

As Evelyn turned to leave, a sudden commotion erupted.

"Isabella! You whore, die!"

A masked figure burst from the crowd, crowbar raised.

Natalie screamed.

The bodyguards reacted instantly, but the attacker moved with military precision—straight for Isabella's head.

Evelyn spun, shielding her aunt with her own body.

"Evelyn!" Sophia and Vanessa shrieked in unison.

Evelyn braced for impact.

A sickening crack.

A pained grunt.

No pain came.

Instead, a familiar voice gasped in her ear, making her heart stop.

Nathaniel.

It was Nathaniel.

Evelyn turned slowly, eyes burning.

Nathaniel stood between her and danger, his strong frame absorbing the blow. His breathing grew labored.

"Evelyn... you okay?"

"Are you insane? I should be asking you!" Her throat tightened.

Despite his blurring vision, Nathaniel managed a weak smile. "If you're worried... then I'm fine."

Then darkness claimed him.

"Nathaniel!" Evelyn caught his collapsing form, voice raw.

Security subdued the attacker immediately, handing him to authorities.

Through tears, Evelyn lunged at the captive.

Sebastian restrained her. "Don't dirty your hands, Evelyn. Let the law handle this scum."

"I'll kill him! I swear I'll—"

The assailant smirked through the police car window as it drove away.

"Sebastian! Don't let him walk!"

Sebastian nodded grimly before following the officers.

Left trembling in the cold, Evelyn felt arms encircle her.

"Evelyn." Alexander pulled her close. "Nathaniel's at Sinclair Medical. Father's arranging our best specialists. He'll pull through."

"Through that?" Evelyn's voice broke. "That was a steel bar! He's lucky to be breathing!"

Oliver winced at his poor attempt at comfort.

"I know every doctor at that hospital. None are better than me." Evelyn pulled away. "If Nathaniel suffers any complications, that man won't live to see trial."

Watching her retreat, the brothers exchanged glances.

"Did I mess up?" Oliver asked sheepishly.

Alexander sighed. "Nathaniel just took a crowbar for Evelyn. Joking wasn't appropriate."

"I know! I just—" Oliver groaned. "Alexander, help me out here. Evelyn's scary when she's mad."

"She won't stay angry. But watch your words about Nathaniel from now on."

Meanwhile, on the Windsor Estates' second-floor balcony...

Adrian observed the chaos below through narrowed eyes, his secretary approaching cautiously.

"Mr. Vanderbilt... Ms. Evelyn was nearly attacked protecting Isabella. Nathaniel intercepted the blow—with his head."

Adrian's jaw tightened.

"Must have military training to survive that," the secretary mused before catching Adrian's murderous glare.

"Did he die?" Adrian's voice dripped ice.

"Critical condition."

"And Evelyn?"

"Gone with him to the hospital."

"Perfect." Adrian's sudden laugh chilled the air. "Play the hero all you want, Nathaniel. Soon, I'll erase every trace of you from Evelyn's heart."

At Sinclair Medical's ER, Nathaniel was rushed into surgery.

Alexander personally assisted Reginald Vanderbilt, Nathaniel's grandfather, as the elderly man nearly collapsed from distress.

"Reginald, our hospital has the finest specialists. I've summoned our top team. Nathaniel will recover!" William Sinclair assured, though worry lined his own face.

"How... how did this happen?" Reginald slumped into a chair, tears brimming. "My boy... hold on."

"Grandfather."

All turned.

Evelyn approached, dust-covered and pale, before kneeling before Reginald.

"My dear..." Reginald started at her bloodshot eyes.

"Grandfather, forgive me." Her voice cracked. "Nathaniel's condition... it's my fault."
###Chapter 323

Hamilton's eyes widened in shock at Evadne's words, his face paling as he stared at her in disbelief.

"Chaos erupted out of nowhere. A thug lunged at us. I was shielding Myra and couldn't react in time. The attacker was skilled—even our bodyguards couldn't stop him."

Evadne's voice trembled as she recalled how Thaddeus had thrown himself in front of her, taking the brutal blow meant for her head. Tears welled in her eyes, her throat tight. "At the last second, Thaddeus pushed me out of the way. If he hadn't, I'd be the one on that operating table right now. Grandpa, this is my fault. I was too slow. Punish me. Scold me. I owe him everything."

Emeric's heart ached at the sight of his proud daughter humbling herself for the sake of the Abernathy heir. "Evadne."

"My foolish girl, why must you be so reckless?"

Tears glistened in Hamilton's eyes as he pulled Evadne into his arms. "Whether it's you or Thaddeus lying there, my heart would shatter. But if it were you? I wouldn't survive it."

"Grandpa." Emotion clogged Evadne's throat, her fingers clutching his sleeves.

"Listen to me, child. Thaddeus chose to take that hit for you. Don't you dare blame yourself."

Hamilton stroked her hair, his weathered face softening. "That bastard broke your heart for three years. If this is his karma, then so be it! Let him suffer—maybe it'll knock some sense into that thick skull of his!"

Evadne knew her grandfather was putting on a brave front.

Hamilton had watched Thaddeus grow up. How could he not be devastated?

"Mr. Frederic!"

Mr. Murray rushed over, his expression grim. "Mr. Frederic and his wife have arrived."

Hamilton's face darkened. "I thought we agreed not to inform them yet?"

"I followed your orders, sir, but news like this spreads fast."

Before Mr. Murray could finish, a commotion erupted down the hall.

"Thaddeus! Where is my son?" Frederic's voice boomed as he stormed toward them.

He rarely showed concern for his second son, but now, hearing that Thaddeus had been struck in the head with an iron rod, he was frantic, his usually composed demeanor shattered.

Elspeth, seeing Frederic's sudden protectiveness over his illegitimate child, seethed internally. Still, she forced a look of distress and joined in the shouting. "Thaddeus! Where is he?"

Even Glynnis cringed at the theatrics, rolling her eyes behind her stepmother's back.

"Enough! Are you trying to summon the dead?"

Supported by Evadne and Mr. Murray, Hamilton rose to his feet, his glare sharpening at the sight of Frederic and Elspeth. His blood pressure spiked, irritation flaring.

"Father! How is Thaddeus?" Frederic demanded.

Hamilton exhaled sharply. "He's still in surgery. Your shouting won't help. Sit down and wait like the rest of us."

"Chairman Emeric!" Frederic whirled on Emeric, his voice venomous. "I heard my son is in this state because he was protecting your daughter. Explain this!"

If not for his reputation, Frederic would have already grabbed Emeric by the collar.

Cassius stepped between them, his tone firm but calm. "Mr. Frederic, let's discuss this rationally."

"Rationally? If it were your brother lying there, would you be rational?" Frederic snarled, his fury directed squarely at the Ashbournes.

Ever since Thaddeus divorced Evadne, his family had been plagued with misfortune. And now, because of her, his son's life hung in the balance.

How could he stay calm?

Elspeth smirked inwardly, relishing the chaos.

She had only meant to ruin Myra. But Thaddeus had thrown himself into the line of fire for Evadne.

If he wanted to die, she wouldn't stop him.

"Mr. Frederic, I understand your anger. But right now, Thaddeus is fighting for his life. Your outbursts won't change that."

Emeric kept his voice steady, though frustration simmered beneath the surface. "Ashbourne Group Hospital, in partnership with Bright Medical, is the top facility in the country. Your son is receiving the best care possible. He will pull through."

Hamilton scoffed. Best? Abernathy Medical was just as advanced.

Emeric always had to boast.

Just then, the operating room doors swung open.

Two of the nation's leading neurosurgeons stepped out, their expressions grave.

Evadne's heart clenched.

She wanted to rush forward, but fear rooted her in place.

"Doctors! How is my grandson?"

Frederic helped Hamilton forward, the older man's legs trembling. Evadne's chest ached at the sight.

"Mr. Thaddeus's condition is critical. He's not out of danger yet." The doctor's tone was heavy.

The words hit like a sledgehammer. Hamilton swayed, his face draining of color.

Frederic paled. "How... how is this possible?"

"If this were a first-time injury, treatment would be straightforward. But our scans revealed an old trauma—a blood clot in his brain that was never fully resolved."

"An old injury?"

Hamilton looked stricken. "My grandson has lived a life of privilege. Who would dare hurt him?"

A memory slammed into Evadne—her time as Thaddeus's wife, treating his chronic headaches with acupuncture. He'd always brushed off her questions, refusing to speak of it.

Had this happened during his years in Zenithia? Was this the source of his pain?

"The clot has shifted, pressing against his brain. Without immediate removal, he risks brain death."

The Abernathy family reeled.

Frederic's knees buckled while Hamilton clung to his son, looking seconds from collapse.

"My poor Thaddeus! He's so young!" Elspeth wailed, crocodile tears streaming as she rounded on Evadne. "Evadne, all he did was divorce you! He never mistreated you in those three years. Why can't you let him go? He skipped my birthday to celebrate Myra's with your family. He was fine when he left, and now he's on death's door! Are you trying to kill him?"

"Elspeth, watch your tongue!"

Cassius, usually unflappable, stepped forward, his voice icy. "In their marriage, Thaddeus was the one who wronged my sister. The Abernathys know exactly how she suffered. We're all concerned for Thaddeus, but don't you dare twist this to vilify Evadne. One more word, and I won't be responsible for my actions."

Emeric stood silently behind Evadne, his presence a shield.

Elspeth shivered but pressed on, knowing Frederic's rage was on her side. "Am I wrong? Since Thaddeus got involved with your sister, has anything good happened? She's a curse!"

"You're the one who's cursed! My grandson is the fool chasing after Evadne. Shut your mouth!" Hamilton wheezed, still defending his beloved granddaughter.

Elspeth's face twisted, colors flickering like a broken neon sign.

"Doctor, what's the next step? How do we save my son?" Frederic ignored the drama, his focus solely on Thaddeus.

His eldest son was already a ghost of a man. He couldn't lose his heir.

The doctor wiped his brow. "Mr. Thaddeus needs an emergency craniotomy."

Silence.

"Do it. Whatever it takes to save him," Hamilton ordered.

"The problem is, we don't have a surgeon qualified for this procedure on-site."

Frederic whirled on Emeric. "Chairman Emeric! You boasted about your hospital's capabilities! What now?"

Emeric's jaw tightened.

"We do have someone."

Evadne stepped forward, her voice steady. "I'll perform the surgery."

Shock rippled through the room—even Emeric and Cassius stared.

They knew Evadne had medical training from her time with Doctors Without Borders.

But this wasn't a field dressing. This was brain surgery.

"What did you say?" Frederic gaped.

"Evadne, you can do this?" Hamilton's eyes lit with hope.

"Yes, Grandpa."

She squeezed his hand, forcing a smile. "Trust me. I'll bring him back to you."

"That's a bold claim. What if you fail?" Glynnis sneered.

Evadne's gaze turned arctic. "If I fail, you can have my head as compensation."

The room fell silent.

Cassius winced. Gruesome.

Jareth only learned of Thaddeus's condition upon arriving at the hospital.

"Mari, there's been an incident with your brother. I'll take you home first. Rest, and don't wait up for me."

He carefully helped Mari into the coat Lily brought, bundling her against the chill. His touch was tender, his voice soothing. To spare her worry, he downplayed Thaddeus's condition.

"What happened to Thaddeus?"

Mari was perceptive. Despite Jareth's calm, she sensed the gravity. "Jareth, don't hide this from me. Tell me!"

"Go home and sleep. When you wake, I'll explain."

He pulled her close, his lips brushing hers in a soft kiss.

Lily discreetly looked away.

"Let's go."

Jareth's eyes crinkled with warmth as he took Mari's hand, leading her out.

Their world had narrowed to just each other, the air between them sweet with unspoken affection.

"Jareth!"

A sharp voice cut through the moment.

Jareth stiffened, his head snapping up in shock.

"Mother? What are you doing here?"

A few paces away, emerging from a sleek black car, stood Mrs. Jareth—and Edith.
###Chapter 324

Edith stood tall beside her mother, dressed like royalty, every inch the princess she pretended to be.

The pitiful act she had put on earlier—crocodile tears and endless apologies—had vanished. Now, her gaze burned into Mari with pure venom, as if she wanted nothing more than to rip her apart.

"Mom, let me introduce you."

Edith forced a smile, locking eyes with Mari. "This is the girl I told you about—Ms. Mari, my junior high school classmate. And now, she's my brother's girlfriend." She sneered the last word. "Funny how life works, isn't it? Almost like fate is playing a joke on us."

At the mention of "girlfriend," Mari's heart twisted painfully. Her cheeks flamed, and she instinctively tried to pull her hand from Jareth's grip.

But he held on tighter, refusing to let go.

"Edith, have you said enough?" His voice darkened, edged with barely restrained fury.

With her mother's backing, Edith laughed boldly. "Jareth, what did I say that was wrong? Or is it that you only dare to spoil her in private but can't stand by her in front of Mom?" Her smile turned cruel. "Deep down, you know she's not fit to be a Fairhaven, don't you?"

"Edith, shut your mouth!" Jareth's control snapped, his eyes blazing with rage.

Lily, standing behind them, clenched her fists so hard her nails bit into her palms.

"Look at you, so angry." Edith smirked. "If I hadn't hit a nerve, would you be this furious?"

"I don't have time for this."

Jareth, ever the composed man, refused to engage in a petty argument with his sister. He turned to Mari and Lily, voice low. "Let's go."

"Wait."

Mrs. Fairhaven's icy voice cut through the air.

Jareth froze, his grip on Mari's hand tightening further.

His mother approached, an unreadable smile on her lips—one that made Jareth lower his guard for just a second.

Then, without warning, her expression twisted.

SLAP!

Mari's head snapped to the side, her cheek burning. Tears welled in her eyes from the humiliation.

"Mom!" Jareth's voice was raw with disbelief, his entire body trembling with fury.

Lily bit her lip hard, but she stayed silent. She was just an employee—she couldn't interfere.

"Do you really think you're good enough for my son?" Mrs. Fairhaven ignored Jareth's rage, her voice dripping with disdain. "I wasn't even satisfied with your sister, Glynnis. Did you really believe I'd accept you—a broken, unstable girl—into this family?"

"Mom!" Jareth stepped between them, his fists clenched so tight his knuckles turned white. "If you ever lay a hand on her again—if you ever insult her again—then you no longer have a son."

Edith gasped, stunned.

Her brother had always been the obedient son, the one who never defied their mother. And yet, for Mari, he was willing to cut ties?

"Jareth, you'd abandon me for this girl?" Mrs. Fairhaven's voice shook, her eyes filled with betrayal.

"She's not just some girl," Jareth said, his voice raw. "She's the woman I love. And if you can't accept that, then you don't accept me."

Edith's mind raced. This wasn't going as planned.

"Jareth, think about what you're doing!" she cried, playing the concerned sister. "How many women have you been with? This is just another phase! Once it passes, you'll regret hurting Mom like this!"

Mari flinched, her fingers tightening around her teddy bear.

She loved Jareth—she knew she did—but doubt crept in. Was she really worth him losing his family?

"Mom," Jareth said, his voice breaking, "I've never asked you for anything. Not once. But now, I'm asking you—begging you—to let me have this. Let me have her."

"No."

Mrs. Fairhaven's answer was absolute. "Over my dead body will that girl step foot in this house!"

Jareth's eyes burned. "Then you leave me no choice."

"You're my only son!" she screamed. "The heir to Fairhaven Corporation! If you throw everything away for her, how will I face your father in the afterlife?"

Edith smirked inwardly. Perfect.

"Jareth, think about Grandpa," she said sweetly. "Do you really think he'd approve?"

Jareth ignored her, turning back to Mari—only to find her gone.

"Mari?!"

Lily gasped. "She disappeared!"

Panic seized him. He didn't care about his mother's shouts, his sister's gloating—he only cared about her.

He ran.

The snow fell softly, blanketing the park in white.

And there she was—sitting on a swing, her dark hair dusted with snowflakes, her red coat nearly buried beneath the frost.

She looked like a lost winter spirit.

Jareth's heart shattered.

"Mari," he whispered, kneeling before her.

She blinked up at him, surprised. "How did you find me?"

"Because I'll always find you." His voice was rough with emotion.

She looked away. "Frank is coming to take me home."

His breath hitched. "You're leaving me?"

Mari shook her head quickly. "I don't want to cause you trouble. Your mother—she's right. You should listen to her."

"I only want to listen to you." He cupped her cold face, his thumb brushing her stinging cheek.

"Jareth, you should go."

He swallowed hard. "Before I do... I need to ask you something."

She waited.

His voice was barely a whisper. "Do you love me?"

For a long moment, she didn't answer.

His heart cracked.

Then—

Slowly, hesitantly, she reached up and covered his hands with hers.

"I love you, Jareth."

His breath stopped.

She continued, soft but sure. "I don't know when it happened. Maybe the first time you kissed me. Maybe when I drew you in secret. Maybe every time you stood by me, no matter what." She met his eyes. "I don't understand love well... but I think this must be it."

Jareth pulled her into his arms, holding her so tightly he feared she might break.

The snow kept falling.

But for the first time in his life, he felt warm.
###Chapter 325

Dawn barely broke when Jareth rushed to the hospital after ensuring Mari was safely tucked in bed. The Ashbourne and Abernathy families had already gathered in tense anticipation.

Hamilton, the aging patriarch, was visibly exhausted. Frederic guided him to a private hospital room to rest.

Cassius stepped into the hallway to answer Aaron’s call.

“Cassius, I just finished interrogating that bastard.” Aaron’s voice crackled through the phone, sharp with frustration. “Years of detective work, and I could tell right away he was hiding something. But he’s stubborn as hell—won’t confess!”

“What did he say?” Cassius’s tone remained steady, unreadable.

Aaron scoffed. “Claims he attacked Myra because he was some obsessed fan. Said he felt betrayed when she retired after that scandal. Absolute bullshit. Myra was stunning—he just couldn’t handle that she was never his to begin with.”

Cassius’s brow furrowed. “Get to the point.”

“Right, sorry.” Aaron exhaled. “He insists seeing Myra back in the spotlight triggered him. But I don’t buy it. Someone put him up to this. His phone’s clean—too clean. I bet he’s got a burner.”

“Dig deeper,” Cassius ordered. “If he was paid, this wasn’t his first job. Find other victims.”

“And if it was his first time?”

Cassius’s voice turned icy. “Then his confession’s a lie. This was planned. Whoever’s targeting Myra won’t get away with it.”

“Understood. I won’t let our family be wronged.” Aaron hesitated. “How’s Thaddeus?”

“Critical.” The word tightened Cassius’s throat.

Aaron fell silent.

“But he’ll make it,” Cassius added, forcing conviction into his voice. “Evadne’s performing the craniotomy. It’s been five hours already.”

“A craniotomy?” Aaron choked. “Does she think skulls are as easy to crack as coconuts? Damn, Cassius, your sister’s revenge on her ex is next-level.”

A faint smirk tugged at Cassius’s lips. “For Dr. Eve? Opening a skull is probably easier than slicing fruit.”

“Wait—Dr. Eve?” Aaron’s shock was palpable. “The miracle surgeon from all those medical journals? That’s Evadne?”

Cassius’s pride was unmistakable. “That’s our little sister.”

Aaron let out a low whistle. “Holy hell, she’s terrifying.”

By 9 a.m., the Abernathy Group had reconvened outside the OR. Frederic supported Hamilton as they both stared at the sealed doors, willing them to open.

Elspeth had retreated home with Glynnis, citing exhaustion. Hamilton despised her; she couldn’t care less about Thaddeus. No point pretending otherwise.

Emeric paced, anxiety gnawing at him. “Why isn’t Evadne out yet? It’s been too long.”

Cassius rested a reassuring hand on his father’s shoulder. “Craniotomies aren’t quick. A full day isn’t unusual. Evadne’s capable—she’ll succeed.”

“I’m not worried about that,” Emeric muttered. “I’m worried about her. Standing for hours—has she eaten? Drank anything?” His fingers twitched, itching to barge in and check on his daughter.

Cassius smirked. “Dad, I thought you were worried about the one inside the OR.”

Emeric shot a glance at Hamilton’s hunched figure and grimaced. “That boy saved my girl. I’ll give him credit—he’s gone from negative to zero in my book.”

Cassius pressed his lips together. He’d promised Evadne to keep their secret: this wasn’t the first time Thaddeus had nearly died for her. Misty Mountain still haunted him.

Before Cassius could speak, a shrill voice cut through the tension.

“Thad! Thad!”

Edith stormed down the hallway, heels clicking, face streaked with tears.

Jareth intercepted her, voice sharp. “Edith, not here. Go home.”

She met his gaze—cold, unfamiliar. The sibling bond they’d shared for twenty years had shattered.

With a furious shove, she pushed past him and lunged toward the Abernathys.

“Mr. Hamilton! Mr. Frederic! How is he? Is he awake?” Her voice cracked, her delicate frame trembling.

Hamilton blinked, bewildered. “Who is this?”

Frederic softened. “Dad, this is Jareth’s sister, Edith. She and Thaddeus grew up together—practically siblings.”

Edith wiped her tears. “Thad’s always been kind to me. When I heard what happened, I had to come. Jareth tried to stop me, but I couldn’t stay away.”

Frederic patted her hand. “Your concern touches us.”

Edith’s cheeks pinked. “We’ve always been close. I’ll always be here for him.”

The subtext was obvious.

Jareth’s jaw clenched.

Emeric nudged Cassius. “She’s into Thaddeus?”

“Seems so.”

“And him?”

Cassius shook his head. “Not a chance.”

Emeric huffed. “What’s so special about that Abernathy boy? My sons are right here.”

Cassius coughed. “Not my type.”

Emeric’s eyebrows shot up.

“Ms. Edith,” Cassius clarified smoothly, “is already spoken for.”

Hamilton’s patience wore thin. “Thank you for your concern, but prayers won’t help. Science will.”

Edith’s eyes flashed. “Of course! But I know Thad. I’d never hurt him—unlike some people.”

Jareth grabbed her arm. “Enough.”

Hamilton’s voice turned dangerous. “Are you blaming Evadne?”

Edith bit her tongue. Obviously. But Hamilton adored Evadne—she couldn’t say it.

Then—

The OR doors burst open.

The hallway erupted into motion.

Medical staff emerged first, followed by slow, deliberate footsteps.

A woman stepped out, her beauty undeniable even in oversized scrubs and a mask.

She removed the mask.

Edith’s breath caught.

Evadne.

“Evadne!” Hamilton and Emeric rushed forward, each grasping one of her trembling hands.

Her face was pale, eyes red-rimmed, mask lines etched into her skin.

Hamilton’s voice wavered. “How is he?”

Evadne squeezed his hand, her smile fragile but triumphant. “The clot’s gone. Surgery was successful.”

The crowd erupted in relief.

Jareth sagged against the wall, whispering thanks.

Frederic clasped his hands. “Blessed be!”

Hamilton shot him a look. “Thank her, not God.”

Frederic stiffly approached Evadne. “Ms. Evadne… thank you for saving my son.”

She shook her head. “He saved me first. This was my duty.”

Hamilton pulled her into a hug, voice thick. “We owe you everything.”

Over his shoulder, Evadne’s icy gaze locked onto Edith—still frozen in shock.
###Chapter 326

A shiver raced down Isabella's spine, forcing her to take an involuntary step back.

Under the intense scrutiny of the gathered crowd, Seraphina moved toward her with effortless grace. Even in heels, Isabella stood a full head shorter than Seraphina.

It wasn’t just the height difference—it was the sheer dominance Seraphina exuded without saying a word. Isabella felt insignificant, like a shadow in her presence.

"What do you want?" Isabella's face paled.

"Answering a question that's been eating at you," Seraphina replied coolly. She pulled off her surgical cap, letting her hair tumble down in a cascade of elegance. "Your precious Nathaniel is out of danger. No need to keep praying."

Then she leaned in, her whisper sharp as a blade. "Though, if you'd just asked me, it would’ve saved you the trouble. Since he got hurt because of me, I was the one who fixed him. His life is my responsibility now. You can stop worrying."

Isabella's shoulders trembled, her cheeks burning with humiliation. The realization that Seraphina had overheard her earlier words twisted like a knife in her gut.

Before she could retaliate, Daniel cut in, eyes sparkling with admiration. "Seraphina, you can perform surgeries too?"

"Obviously. Did you think a donkey did it?" Seraphina wiped the sweat from her brow, exhaustion clear in her voice. She wasn’t in the mood for idle chatter.

"No, no! I mean—you're incredible. Absolutely brilliant!" Daniel fumbled for words.

"If you'd paid attention in school, you'd have a better vocabulary for compliments," she shot back, shaking her head. She couldn’t fathom why Olivia was interested in someone so inelegant.

Isabella seethed, wishing she could silence Daniel permanently.

Then, hurried footsteps echoed down the corridor.

"Chairman Reginald! President Kingsley! I just heard of your arrival—forgive my delay in greeting you!" Mr. Whitmore, the hospital dean, rushed forward with his deputy and two specialists, his tone dripping with deference.

"No need for formalities, Mr. Whitmore. We didn’t want to disrupt your work," Reginald replied warmly, devoid of arrogance.

"Ah, Mr. Whitmore, allow me to introduce my daughter, Seraphina!" Reginald beamed, seizing the chance to show off his prodigy like a peacock flaunting its feathers. "You won’t believe it—my daughter is a surgical genius! She just led a ten-hour operation!"

Kingsley and Daniel both stiffened at the term "lead surgeon."

Mr. Whitmore and the deputy dean exchanged stunned glances. "Chairman Reginald... she's your daughter?"

Reginald frowned. "What kind of question is that? If she’s not mine, is she yours?"

"No, no! I mean—do you even know who your daughter is?"

Reginald blinked. "Know what?"

Mr. Whitmore inhaled deeply, then announced with reverence, "Her skills are legendary. She’s the renowned Dr. Eve!"

Gasps rippled through the crowd. The Sinclair heiress—already a masterful hotelier and design prodigy—was also a miracle doctor?

Unbelievable!

Harrison and Frederick stood frozen. As men of influence, they knew Dr. Eve’s reputation well.

Her surgical prowess was unmatched. To have her operate was considered divine intervention.

Yet Dr. Eve was an enigma—never revealing her identity, never granting interviews. Only a select few, like Kingsley and Mr. Whitmore, knew the truth.

The Sinclair heiress was Dr. Eve.

Frederick was speechless, struggling to process the revelation.

The quiet girl who had lived under his roof for three years—this was who she truly was?

A crushing wave of loss and inadequacy washed over him. He’d never find another daughter as extraordinary as Seraphina.

Seraphina sighed, a wry smile touching her lips. "You weren’t supposed to tell my father. I asked you to keep it quiet."

"Ms. Seraphina, you’ve saved this hospital countless times these past three years. How could I keep such news from Chairman Reginald? Even if the world doesn’t know, your father deserves to!" Mr. Whitmore’s eyes shone with admiration.

"You little rascal."

Reginald was torn between pride and irritation. He wanted to scold her but couldn’t bring himself to. Instead, he pinched her cheek. "Hiding this from your own father? Do you need a spanking?"

"Reginald! There are people here!" Seraphina hissed, her face flushing crimson.

"Grandpa..."

Harrison’s eyes brimmed with tears as he approached, gripping her shoulders as if she might vanish. No matter how long he looked, it wasn’t enough. "Seraphina, I’m sorry. The Vanderbilt Group failed you."

"Grandpa, what are you saying? Don’t talk like that."

"No. Our family wronged you."

The weight of his regret pressed down on him. He couldn’t let go. "What do I do? I don’t want anyone else near my grandson. No one but you can be my granddaughter! I’m being selfish, shameless—but I don’t care! I want you, Seraphina!"

Reginald scowled, ready to intervene, but Kingsley held him back.

"Grandpa, you’re acting like a child," Seraphina muttered, her cheeks pink.

At that moment, she was the sun—everyone adored her, worshipped her.

And on the outskirts, ignored and forgotten, Isabella stood with a face like death. Even her own brother didn’t spare her a glance.

Harrison’s words were daggers in her heart, each syllable twisting deeper. The pain and hatred coiled inside her, fueling fantasies of Seraphina’s demise—over and over again.
###Chapter 327

Four days.

That's all it took for him to wake up.

After major brain surgery, most patients would remain unconscious for at least ten days.

But Thaddeus Chambers was no ordinary man.

A former elite operative, his body was built for endurance, for survival.

So when his heavy eyelids finally lifted on the fourth day, the first thing he saw was Gordon's haggard face—his beard unkempt, his cheeks hollowed from exhaustion.

"Mr. Chambers! You're awake!"

Gordon's voice was hoarse from days of waiting, but the relief in his tone was unmistakable.

Thaddeus groaned, his vision swimming as he adjusted to the harsh hospital lights.

His head throbbed. His ears rang.

And the first coherent thought that formed?

Evadne.

"Where is she?" His voice was rough, barely more than a growl.

Gordon blinked, momentarily stunned.

Even half-dead, Thaddeus' priority wasn't his own condition—it was her.

"Mrs. Abernathy is fine," Gordon assured him quickly. "You saved her. She's unharmed."

Thaddeus didn't relax.

His last memory was a blur of violence—a thug swinging a metal rod toward Evadne's head.

Had he reached her in time?

If he hadn't—

His pulse spiked, his breathing turning ragged.

Before Gordon could react, Thaddeus shoved himself upright, ignoring the sharp protest of his injuries.

"I need to see her. Now."

The medical team rushed in, alarmed by his sudden movement.

But Thaddeus wasn't listening.

His entire body burned with urgency, his mind consumed by one thought: Evadne. Evadne. Evadne.

Then—

"Thaddeus Chambers, if you don't get back in that bed this instant, I swear to God I'll sedate you myself."

The room fell silent.

Standing in the doorway, Evadne Abernathy crossed her arms, her expression icy.

But even in her irritation, she was breathtaking.

Thaddeus' breath hitched.

Gordon and the medical staff took that as their cue to leave.

The door clicked shut.

Evadne didn't move.

"You just had brain surgery," she snapped. "Act like it."

Thaddeus didn't care.

In three strides, he was in front of her, his hands gripping her waist as he pulled her flush against him.

Her scent—vanilla and something uniquely her—flooded his senses.

"Evadne," he murmured, his voice rough with emotion.

She stiffened. "You're hurt—"

"I don't care."

His lips found hers before she could protest.

It wasn't gentle.

It was desperate.

A starving man finally given a taste of salvation.

Evadne's hands pressed against his chest, but the moment his tongue slid against hers, her resistance crumbled.

His body was hot, his grip unyielding.

And his heart—

God, his heart was pounding so hard she could feel it through his hospital gown.

When he finally pulled back, they were both breathless.

Evadne's cheeks burned.

Thaddeus, the bastard, looked smug.

"You—" She shoved at his chest. "Unbelievable."

His lips curved. "You liked it."

"I did not—"

He kissed her again.

And again.

By the time Evadne escaped, her lips were swollen, her pulse erratic.

She stormed into Dr. Larry's office, her composure in tatters.

The doctor took one look at her flushed face and wisely said nothing.

"The scans," Evadne demanded.

Dr. Larry handed them over.

Her stomach dropped.

The surgery had been a success—technically.

But the side effects...

She clenched her jaw.

"His emotional regulation is compromised," Dr. Larry confirmed quietly. "For now, sedation is our only option."

Evadne's grip tightened on the scans.

Failure.

The word burned in her chest.

And the worst part?

She knew exactly what had stabilized him earlier.

Her lips still tingled from the proof.

Midnight.

The Velvet Haven's most exclusive private room was bathed in dim light.

Avery Chambers lounged on the sofa, his sharp features cast in shadow.

Two women in slitted dresses hovered nearby—close enough to pour his drinks, but not close enough to touch.

Everyone knew better than to test Avery's patience.

One woman, too bold, spilled wine on his shoe.

Her face paled.

"Clean it," Avery said, his voice devoid of emotion.

She dropped to her knees.

Lick by lick, she obeyed.

When she finished, Avery dismissed her with a flick of his wrist.

The moment the door closed behind them, his secretary stepped in.

"Mr. Chambers," he murmured. "Miss Elsie is here."

Avery's lips curved.

The game was just beginning.
###Chapter 328

Avery's exhausted gaze finally ignited with life after a night of dark contemplation.

"Let her in."

"Right away, Mr. Chambers!" The secretary bowed and retreated.

Moments later, the sharp click of stilettos pierced the silence of the private room.

"Ave."

That sultry voice preceded the entrance of a woman whose every movement was calculated elegance.

Avery's eyes narrowed, his lips curling into a smirk as he studied Elsie—his masterpiece, sculpted to perfection.

Elsie, proprietress of The Velvet Haven, was a woman forged in the fires of the underworld. Her approach was intoxicating, exuding sophistication rather than cheap seduction.

But the most startling thing was her face.

The moment she stepped inside, Avery's pulse spiked.

Raven-black hair, crimson lips, that self-assured smile—features he'd meticulously refined over the years. She was a near-perfect replica of Evadne.

The only difference? The aura. That untouchable magnetism Evadne possessed could never be replicated, no matter how hard Elsie tried.

"Come here, Elsie." Avery's throat bobbed as he crooked a finger.

She obeyed instantly, gliding toward him. He seized her wrist and yanked, sending her tumbling into his lap.

"Ave."

Her eyes brimmed with devotion as her fingers toyed with his tie, loosening the knot. Her lips parted, aching for his—

"Have you forgotten my warning?"

Avery's voice turned glacial, his warmth vanishing. "You may look like her, but you are not Evadne. Know your place. My kisses belong to her alone."

"I—I understand. Forgive me." Elsie recoiled as if burned, her fingers trembling.

Among all of Avery's subordinates, only she was permitted to call him "Ave."

Most assumed it was favoritism. Only she knew the truth—her privilege existed solely because of her resemblance to the woman he could never have.

Elsie bit her lip, heart aching.

She'd been with Avery since she was fifteen, molded by his hands. All these years, his obsession with Evadne never waned.

What kind of woman could inspire such relentless longing?

"You seem troubled, Ave. Is it about Evadne?" Her voice was soft, probing. "She and Thaddeus are growing closer."

Avery's eyes darkened with venom. "Even divorced, they're drawn to each other. And I can't interfere."

"Tell me how to help you," she whispered, desperation burning in her gaze.

"I've invested years in perfecting your face. Now, it's time to prove its worth." His fingers traced her jaw, possessive and cold.

A knock interrupted them.

"Mr. Chambers, it's me."

"Enter."

The secretary stepped in, startled—as always—by the uncanny resemblance between Elsie and Evadne.

"What is it?" Avery bit into the fruit Elsie had offered him.

"Your informant at Ashbourne Hospital sent word."

News of Thaddeus' awakening spread like wildfire.

Hamilton and Frederic rushed to the hospital. The moment Hamilton saw his grandson conscious, he nearly collapsed with relief, pulling him into a crushing embrace.

"Thaddeus! You reckless boy! Do you know how terrified I was?"

"Forgive me, Grandfather." Thaddeus returned the hug, guilt gnawing at him.

"How do you feel? Any pain? Dizziness?" Hamilton reached to touch his head but hesitated—this was a skull reassembled after ten hours of surgery. Priceless. Fragile.

"I'm fine."

Thaddeus saw his grandfather's fear and gently guided the old man's hand to his head. "See? Still in one piece."

"Stubborn fool!" Hamilton chuckled, eyes glistening.

Frederic lingered awkwardly. When Thaddeus was unconscious, he'd barely slept. Now that his son was awake, he couldn't muster a single kind word.

"Don't pull this stunt again," he grumbled. "Protecting your woman is one thing, but throwing yourself into danger? Foolish."

Hamilton scoffed. "Oh, shut it. At least my grandson has the sense to cherish the right woman. Unlike some people still pining after vipers."

"Father!"

Frederic's face flushed crimson. Before he could retort, his phone buzzed.

His breath caught.

It was his eldest son—calling from overseas.
###Chapter 329

"Son! What a wonderful surprise to hear from you!"

Frederic's stern face instantly softened, his voice dripping with warmth—a stark contrast to his usual cold, authoritative demeanor.

Thaddeus blinked slowly.

In all his years, his father had never spoken to him with such affection. Never once had Frederic called him "son" with such tenderness.

That term of endearment had always been reserved for his older brother. So, in Frederic's heart, was Elspeth truly the only woman he had ever loved? And his eldest son the only child he cherished?

The irony burned, but Thaddeus swallowed his words.

"Dad, how have you been?" Chad's deep, resonant voice carried through the phone.

Chad's voice was unmistakable—rich and steady, the kind that could command a room even through a receiver.

"I'm well, son. And you? How’s your health? Everything going smoothly? Any setbacks?" Frederic had flown to the States last year to visit his eldest but hadn’t been able to make the trip this year.

"I’m fine. Don’t worry."

A pause. Then, concern laced Chad’s next words. "I heard Thaddeus was injured and hospitalized. How is he? Is it serious?"

Thaddeus’s jaw tensed.

He didn’t resent his brother’s concern. But it was unsettling—Chad, who hadn’t stepped foot in Elmsworth in over a decade, somehow knew about his condition.

Frederic explained, "Thaddeus just had major surgery. He was unconscious for days, but he’s awake now."

"Are you at the hospital with him?"

"Yes, your grandfather and I are in his room."

"Could you pass the phone to Thaddeus? I’d like to speak with him."

Frederic obliged, handing the phone over. "Your brother wants to talk to you."

Thaddeus hesitated before accepting. "Chad."

"Thaddeus, I heard about your injury. I’m deeply concerned. If I could, I’d fly back to see you." Chad’s voice was thick with worry.

"Chad, I’m fine. Don’t trouble yourself with the long flight."

Thaddeus forced a small smile, though his brother couldn’t see it. "I’m recovering well. There’s nothing to worry about."

"Your surgery was performed by Miss Evadne, wasn’t it?"

Thaddeus stiffened. "Yes."

"I know. Miss Evadne is my sister-in-law. You two divorced this year, yet she still operated on you despite everything. She’s truly remarkable—forgiving and generous."

Chad’s voice held a note of admiration. "Even if you two can’t be together, given her character, you should maintain a good relationship with her."

Thaddeus’s lips pressed into a thin line.

His brother, living oceans away, seemed to know every detail of his life.

"Chad, it was my fault things ended the way they did with Evadne. I didn’t appreciate what I had. I brought this on myself, and I owe her more than I can ever repay."

His fist clenched, resolve hardening in his eyes. "But I’ve made up my mind—I’ll win her back, no matter what it takes. My wife was Evadne in the past. And in the future, it will only ever be Evadne."

Frederic’s eyes widened.

His son was dead serious about tying his life to the Ashbourne girl forever.

He couldn’t deny Evadne was exceptional—far above most women. But was she worth upending his life for?

"Well said! Absolutely well said!" Hamilton, on the other hand, was thrilled, slapping Thaddeus’s back so hard he nearly coughed.

Silence stretched on the line before Chad chuckled. "Good. That’s the right mindset. I wish you and Miss Evadne a successful reunion."

"Thank you, Chad." Thaddeus’s reply was quiet.

For some reason, the phrase "successful reunion" left an uneasy weight in his chest.

Hamilton took the phone, his tone bright. "Chad! How’s life overseas? I hear the beaches are stunning. When are you inviting me over for a vacation?"

"Grandpa, no matter how beautiful it is abroad, it’s not home."

Chad’s laugh was gentle. "You’re getting older, and the journey is long. I wouldn’t want you exhausting yourself. Maybe soon, when my health improves, we can meet in Elmsworth."

Thaddeus gave no outward reaction, but his chest tightened inexplicably.

"Ha! That would be wonderful! Having you back would make us whole again!"

Hamilton sighed. "But don’t push yourself. I know your condition. Even if you can’t return, I’ll come to you. A private jet makes it easy—just a few hours. No strain at all."

They chatted a while longer before hanging up.

"Dad, did Chad just say he’s planning to come back? Is that true?" Frederic’s eyes lit up with hope.

Hamilton’s expression flickered, but before he could respond, Mr. Murray knocked and entered.

"Mr. Frederic, Miss Evadne, Mr. Jareth and Mari are here."

"Who? Mari too?"

Frederic barely had time to process before Evadne and Jareth walked in—hand in hand with Mari.

Boldly. Unapologetically. As if making a public declaration.

Mari hid shyly behind Jareth, her cheeks flushed.

Evadne watched them, irritation prickling under her skin. But what could she say? They were clearly smitten. She couldn’t play the villain.

"Jareth, what is this?"

Frederic stared at their intertwined fingers, shock rippling through him.

"Uncle Frederic." Jareth’s smile was disarmingly charming.

The room froze.

Evadne nearly choked on her coffee. Since when did the Fairhavens address Frederic so familiarly?

Frederic stiffened. "Jareth, what do you mean by this?"

Jareth took a deep breath, lifting their joined hands. "Uncle Frederic, Mari and I are in love. Deeply, irrevocably in love. My feelings for her run as deep as the Grand Canyon."

Thaddeus and Evadne facepalmed in unison. Who taught him these cheesy lines?

"Jareth, please stop. It’s embarrassing." Mari squeezed his hand, her face burning.

"So," Jareth barreled on, nerves making his voice shake, "I’m asking for your blessing to marry her! I know my past isn’t spotless, but I swear I’ll be the best husband—better than Thaddeus is to Evadne! I’ll make her the happiest woman alive. Please, let me marry her!"

He squeezed Mari’s hand so hard it turned red.

Evadne shot Jareth a icy glare for using Thaddeus as a benchmark.

Thaddeus smirked. Better than me? Good luck.

Jareth’s speech was rushed, his face stiff, but his eyes burned with sincerity.

Hamilton sighed. Poor kid’s desperate.

"Jareth, I don’t doubt your intentions." Frederic, a seasoned businessman, was nearly bowled over by the sudden proposal.

"Thaddeus!"

Mari hurried to his bedside, eyes wide. "Jareth said you were hurt. Are you okay? Does it still hurt?"

Thaddeus gently cupped her face. "Not anymore. Your sister-in-law saved me. She took excellent care of me."

Jareth’s jaw twitched at the contact. Even if it was her brother, jealousy flared.

"That’s good."

Mari suddenly grabbed Evadne’s hand. "Evadne, please stay with Thaddeus until he’s better. He’ll recover faster with you here."

Evadne’s heart skipped. She bit her lip.

Thaddeus gazed at her like a lost puppy.

Both siblings—impossible to refuse.

"Your brother got hurt because of me. It’s my responsibility."

Her smile was soft as morning dew. "I’ll take care of him until he’s healed."

"Yay!" Mari clapped.

Thaddeus exhaled in relief.

"Thank you, Evadne." His voice was thick with emotion.

Evadne feigned indifference, but her pulse betrayed her.

With an important meeting, Frederic had to leave.

Now that Evadne’s identity as Dr. Eve was out, she became Thaddeus’s primary physician. His follow-ups fell to her.

After checking on him, she sent him for tests with Jareth and Mr. Larry.

Only Evadne, Hamilton, and Mr. Murray remained.

"Evadne, you’ve been distracted. What’s wrong?" Hamilton seized the moment to ask.

Evadne stiffened. "Nothing, Grandpa."

"You can’t fool me." His worry deepened. "Is something wrong with Thaddeus’s injury?"

"Grandpa..."

"Tell me straight. I can handle anything. But if you keep secrets, I’ll lose sleep over it!"

Evadne hesitated, then turned to Mr. Murray. "Could you give us a moment?"

Once alone, she confessed.

"So, Thaddeus has PTSD?" Hamilton’s heart clenched.

"Yes. It’s all my fault."

Guilt weighed her down. "If I’d been better, this wouldn’t have happened."

"Evadne, don’t blame yourself. Without you, Thaddeus and I might not be here."

Hamilton gripped her hand. "But you must promise me—keep his condition secret. The fewer who know, the better."

"Only Mr. Larry and I know. He’s trustworthy."

She frowned. "But Grandpa, when his episodes hit, sedatives are the only solution. I can’t predict when they’ll strike. Eventually, people will find out."

"We’ll hide it as long as possible. At least until Thaddeus secures his inheritance—the majority of Abernathy Group’s shares and assets."

Hamilton’s eyes blazed. "The company’s future rests in his hands alone. If his illness leaks, not just his inheritance but his CEO position could be at risk!"

Evadne was puzzled. "Traditionally, the eldest son inherits. Shouldn’t Chad be the heir? I assumed you chose Thaddeus because of Chad’s health. But from your tone, that’s not the case. Why must it be Thaddeus?"

Hamilton’s throat worked. He said nothing.
###Chapter 330

The grimace on Harrison's face told Arabella she'd stumbled upon sacred ground in the Kingsley family history.

She knew better than to pry, but this involved Alexander. She couldn't help herself. "Grandfather, is there tension between Alexander and Dominic? Does it trace back to their childhood kidnapping?"

Harrison's eyes widened. "You know about the kidnapping?"

"I'm sorry, Grandfather. I didn't mean to overstep."

Arabella's throat tightened as she continued softly, "Alexander mentioned his older brother once. He said he'd tell me everything when the time was right. He didn't want to hide anything from me. At the time, I resisted knowing, but... I was curious."

Harrison listened, a smile softening his features as he noticed the faint blush on her cheeks. It was as if the shy girl from years past had returned, lifting the weight from his shoulders.

This was progress.

Arabella was no longer pushing Alexander away. She was even showing interest in him. Their relationship was evolving.

"Bella, if Alexander is willing to share his past with you, it means he trusts you completely. He's opening his heart to you."

Harrison exhaled heavily, the pain of the past still raw. "My grandsons were taken by a notorious criminal syndicate—drug traffickers, murderers, bank robbers. They specialized in kidnapping heirs from wealthy families."

"You mean the Moreau syndicate?"

Arabella had heard of them. Seraphina had mentioned them.

Moreau had once been a subordinate under Seraphina's father but broke away to build his own empire.

Back then, Moreau was ruthless. He taunted law enforcement, vowing to retire only after amassing ten billion. When he was arrested eighteen years ago, the nation celebrated. But Moreau showed no remorse. He smirked for the cameras.

Seraphina once said her father's greatest regret was not eliminating Moreau when he had the chance.

"Yes." Harrison sighed. "Despite our precautions, Moreau took my grandsons."

A chill ran down Arabella's spine. "What happened after?"

"They demanded two hundred million—one hundred per child. Back then, that sum was equivalent to a billion today. I didn't hesitate. Nothing mattered more than my grandsons. But Moreau was cunning. He kept changing the ransom drop location, toying with us. Alexander and Dominic were held for half a month. We couldn't involve the authorities."

Harrison lowered his gaze, shaking his head. "Eventually, Alexander escaped. He was only eleven. I never thought he'd make it out alive."

"Alone?" Arabella was stunned. "How could an eleven-year-old escape trained criminals? Did someone help him?"

"Yes. Dominic did."

Arabella inhaled sharply.

Dominic had been fifteen—taller, stronger. But still just a boy. Unarmed. Unprepared. How had he distracted the kidnappers long enough for Alexander to flee?

"Grandfather, how did Dominic escape?"

"We paid the ransom. Half a month later, Dominic was found naked outside Kingsley Manor." Harrison's face paled. "When he returned, he was barely alive. Covered in blood. Tortured. His health was ruined."

"Why?"

Harrison's lips trembled. "Dominic told us later—after helping Alexander escape, he enraged Moreau. Since they hadn't received the ransom yet, they couldn't kill him. So they made him suffer. Starved him. Beat him. Locked him in an airtight shipping container. By the time he reached the hospital, his organs were failing. We barely saved him. Even now, his immune system is weak. He often needs a wheelchair. We failed him."

Now, Arabella understood.

This was the source of Alexander's guilt—why Reginald treated him so harshly.

Alexander had escaped because of his brother's sacrifice. And Dominic had paid the price. Alexander had carried that burden ever since, enduring Reginald's cruelty as penance.

"Bella, don't mention this to Alexander. If he doesn't bring it up, pretend you don't know." Harrison's voice was heavy with worry.

Arabella smiled gently. "I understand, Grandfather."

"But Bella... do you think less of Alexander now? Do you see him as selfish for surviving when his brother didn't?"

A pang of sadness struck her. She moved closer, placing her warm hand over his aged one.

"Grandfather, I could never look down on him. If I did, I wouldn't have married him. He was just as much a victim. The only difference is that he had a brother willing to sacrifice for him—and the luck to return to you safely. I pity Dominic. But Alexander doesn't deserve scorn. I know he would have saved Dominic if he could. He's carried that guilt for years."

Harrison was deeply moved. He pulled her into a tight embrace. "Oh, Bella... with you beside him, I can rest easy. Even if I'm gone one day, I know he'll be in good hands."

Arabella's cheeks flushed. She patted his back gently, unable to find words.

After his medical check-up and IV drip, Alexander noticed night had fallen.

Nathaniel heard Seraphina's stomach growl. She was too shy to admit she was hungry, so he decided to leave.

"I should get home and cook for Seraphina," he said, pulling her close. They were inseparable.

Alexander nearly choked on his water. "Nathaniel, are you delirious? If you've got brain damage, have Arabella check you immediately. Don't keep my sister waiting."

Arabella smirked. "Decided to become a chef after years of debauchery? It's like a courtesan turning over a new leaf. Admirable."

"It's my first time cooking," Nathaniel admitted. He'd never stepped foot in a kitchen before.

"Nathaniel, don't push yourself," Seraphina said worriedly.

Arabella rolled her eyes. "If you want to poison yourself, fine. Just don't drag Seraphina into it."

Alexander kept his lips pursed. "If the oil catches fire, turn off the heat and cover the pan. Don't use water."

"I'll remember," Seraphina said obediently.

Nathaniel scowled. "I'm not an idiot! I know how to handle a kitchen!"

Before Arabella could retort, Nathaniel swept Seraphina into his arms and bolted.

Silence returned, thick with awkward tension.

Alexander hadn't showered since his injury. The room smelled faintly sour.

Yet even disheveled, he was devastatingly handsome.

Arabella cleared her throat. "Since we're alone, let's discuss something serious."

His voice was low. "You want to investigate the man who attacked Lady Margaret. Find out who he really was—and why he did it."

Her eyes gleamed. "Yes."

"Arabella, I'll handle this. Once I'm discharged."

"I can't wait." Her voice was steel. "Do you know how traumatized Margaret is? I've been too busy operating on you to investigate. But I will find who's responsible."

Alexander merely smiled. He knew she would.

"Arabella, revenge requires patience. The mastermind won't escape."

She bit her lip, emotions swirling.

There was another reason she needed answers—one she couldn't voice.

That man had nearly killed Alexander. If she hadn't been there...

The thought haunted her. She needed justice, or she'd explode.

"Alexander, even though you took the hit for Margaret and me, this involves the Sinclair family. Focus on recovering. Leave this to us."

"It's a Sinclair matter, but Arabella—I'm your husband." His voice was rough, gaze intense.

She stared, speechless.

"So I will help you."

"Enough. I'm leaving."

She couldn't stand his nonsense any longer.

"Arabella! Don't go!"

Desperate, Alexander sat up abruptly—then dizziness struck. Nausea overwhelmed him.

Just as he swayed, the scent of roses filled his senses.

Strong arms caught him.

"Alexander."

Emotion choked him. He pulled her close, burying his face in her hair, inhaling her scent like a man starved.

Before, she'd been within reach.

Now, she felt miles away. Regret consumed him.

Arabella struggled to breathe in his crushing embrace.

How could a man fresh from brain surgery be so strong?

"Alexander."

She shoved against his shoulders, but he was immovable—like forged steel.

"Get off. You reek."
###Chapter 331

The moment Alexander Kingsley fell for Isabella Sinclair, he understood one thing.

Isabella was like a coconut—hard and unyielding on the outside, but inside, tender, sincere, and full of warmth.

He had nothing left to offer her, so he clung shamelessly, desperate for every second he could steal with her.

Before, it was her who sought him out, carving out moments just for them.

Now, the tables had turned.

In the end, Isabella couldn’t bring herself to leave the hospital room. She sighed, relenting.

"Don’t misunderstand. I’m not staying because of you. I promised Grandpa and Mari," she said, steadying her voice as she sat up from the bedside. "I’ll sleep in the next room. Call if you need me."

Alexander’s dark eyes burned as he caught her wrist. "Stay here tonight."

"The couch is uncomfortable," she countered, trying to pull away. His grip tightened.

"Then share the bed." His voice was low, coaxing.

"Alexander Kingsley, is it that hard for you to ask nicely?" She wished she had a ruler to measure the depths of his audacity.

"Don’t overthink it. I won’t force you." A pause. "Though I want to."

Heat radiated from his body as he leaned closer.

Want to? Go to hell.

"You reek," she snapped, recoiling and pinching her nose. "I’d rather not suffocate in my sleep."

"Reek?" He sniffed his shirt, frowning. "When I was in the military, I went weeks without a shower. This is nothing."

Her breath hitched.

She knew his past, the scars he carried. No one understood him like she did.

She didn’t despise him. She was just… afraid. Even now, with his walls down, she couldn’t bring herself to step closer.

She’d loved him once, recklessly, like a moth to a flame. But when he’d extinguished that fire, her heart had turned to ash. Reigniting it wasn’t easy.

"I’ll clean up," he said abruptly, moving to rise.

"Don’t. Your stitches can’t get wet." She pried his fingers off her wrist. "I’ll go shower."

Alexander was weaker than he let on. Pride kept him from showing vulnerability. He believed men should be strong, protectors.

Yet here he was, laid low by a head wound. Pathetic.

The sound of running water filled the room. For the first time in years, he felt peace.

Then, memories struck like daggers.

Their marriage. His impatience. Her slow baths, her meticulous skincare, the meals she’d cooked—all wasted on him.

The bathroom door opened.

Isabella emerged, hair wrapped in a towel, skin flushed from the steam.

His breath caught.

"You look better without makeup."

"Stop repeating yourself," she muttered, flopping onto the couch. "And if you can’t compliment me properly, don’t bother. I’m always stunning. A goddess, really."

"You are," he agreed, gazing at her like she hung the moon. "You’ve always been beautiful."

"Always? Prove it."

"Even when you were my wife," he said, voice raw.

She scoffed. "If I was so beautiful, why did you ignore me for three years?"

He shut his mouth. The more he spoke, the deeper he dug his grave.

But he’d chip away at her walls. He knew her heart wasn’t stone—just a coconut.

A knock interrupted them.

"Mr. Kingsley, are you and Mrs. Kingsley awake?" Gordon called.

Before she could answer, Alexander said, "Come in."

The door swung open.

Gordon and two bodyguards staggered in, hauling a massive bed.

"Your order, sir!" Gordon panted, wiping sweat.

Isabella’s jaw dropped. The bed was identical to her custom-made one at home—worth two hundred thousand dollars.

"What is this?" she hissed.

"You won’t sleep on the couch. You won’t share my bed." He shrugged. "So I bought another."

She marched over and punched the mattress.

Damn. Soft.

Outside, winter winds howled. Inside, warmth settled.

Their beds sat side by side. Gordon, ever the opportunist, nudged them closer.

By the time she noticed, it was too late. The men fled, leaving her trapped with her infuriating ex-husband.

She lay stiffly, eyes shut.

Alexander mirrored her, heart racing at her nearness. His fingers inched toward her.

"Don’t," she warned.

He froze.

"Or you’ll lose that hand."

A bead of sweat slid down his temple.

Silence stretched. Eventually, her breathing evened out.

Gently, he laced his fingers with hers.

"Isabella," he whispered. "I love you. Goodnight."

He drifted off, content.

Minutes later, her lashes fluttered open.

"Jerk," she murmured. "Goodnight."

Two days later, Isabella returned to her Skyrim estate.

She needed to check on Myra—and consult Suri about Alexander’s condition.

"Nydia, how is she?" Isabella asked, hugging her tearful cousin.

"Hiding in her room. Won’t eat. Won’t sleep." Nydia trembled. "Evadne, what if she—"

"She’s stronger than you think," Isabella soothed, noting Nydia’s weight loss. "Jason!"

The bodyguard hurried over, dark circles under his eyes. "We’ve been guarding her in shifts. She’s safe."

"I left you to care for Nydia," Isabella snapped. "Look at her! Skin and bones!"

Jason paled. "I’m sorry, Miss Sinclair. Punish me."

"Evadne, no!" Nydia clung to him. "He’s exhausted himself for me!"

Isabella rolled her eyes. "Fine. Your punishment? Take Nydia out. Dinner. Dessert. Don’t come back before dark."

Nydia gaped.

Jason’s lips curved. "Ms. Nydia, you’re stuck with me."

Her heart soared.

Isabella shooed them off, then sought Suri.

"Don’t rush Myra," Suri warned. "She won’t even see your father."

Isabella hesitated. "Suri… I need a favor."

"Favor?" Suri poked her cheek. "Since when do we stand on ceremony?"

Isabella rested her head on Suri’s shoulder. "Your nephew—Chasel Bright. The neurosurgeon. Can you ask him to come?"

Suri blinked. "Oh? Is this a secret romance?"

Isabella groaned.

"You’re eloping? Perfect! A doctor and an heiress—"

"Suri!" Isabella pinched her brow. "Alexander’s injured. I need Chasel’s expertise."

Suri’s smile faded. She still resented Alexander—but he had saved Isabella.

"Suri?"

"I’ll try," Suri sighed. "But Chasel’s… eccentric. If he refuses—"

"Then I’ll call Elvis," Isabella said darkly. "He’ll ship Chasel here if he has to."
###Chapter 332

Suri hesitated to approach Elvis. The bitterness he harbored toward her and the entire family was palpable.

Despite pouring her heart into loving this family, despite her genuine affection for Emeric and his children, she remained the villain in his eyes—the woman who shattered his father's monogamy. Then came Myra. Then Aviana.

Would Emeric have taken so many lovers if she hadn't been the first?

The saying "the early bird gets the worm" had never felt so cruel. Being first meant bearing the brunt of judgment, the weight of guilt, the relentless scrutiny.

"I shouldn't delay this any longer. I'll call Chasel now."

For Evadne, Suri would move mountains. Without hesitation, she grabbed her phone and dialed her nephew.

After a few rings, a voice laced with youthful charm answered. "Aunt Suri! I was just thinking about you."

"Were you? Or were you too busy partying to remember your old aunt?" Suri feigned irritation.

"Never. How could I forget you? Especially when you're still the most beautiful woman in the room."

Evadne arched a brow, amused.

Chasel's smooth-talking reminded her of the roguish protagonist from one of her favorite romance novels.

"Chasel, you're not a boy anymore. When you were younger, flattery was cute. Now it's bordering on sleazy." Suri laughed, teasing him.

"Sleazy? I'm twenty-seven! Sleazy doesn't start until thirty."

He chuckled, then added with a smirk, "Unless I'm mistaken, all my older cousins have crossed that threshold, haven't they? Aunt Suri, you've been surrounded by too many sleazy men. Maybe you should visit me—get some fresh air with a charming, dashing gentleman like myself."

Evadne's amusement vanished. He was insufferable—like bad cologne in an elevator.

"Enough joking."

Suri cleared her throat, her tone shifting to seriousness. "Chasel, I need your help."

"Name it. No need for formalities."

She hesitated, then lowered her voice. "Could you come back for a while? I have a patient—severe head trauma, nearly fatal. He's stable post-craniotomy, but the aftereffects are severe. You're the best neurosurgeon I know. Will you examine him?"

"Who is he?"

Suri glanced at Evadne, whose anxiety was palpable. "I'll explain when you arrive."

"You know my rule. No patient without full disclosure. Otherwise, I refuse."

Suri exhaled sharply. "His name is Thaddeus. He's... a very important friend of Evadne's."

"Thaddeus? The Thaddeus Abernathy?" Chasel's voice turned icy.

"Yes."

"Aunt Suri, I'm busy. Goodbye."

"Wait—!"

But the line went dead.

Suri sighed, defeated. "Evadne, I'm sorry. He won't even listen to his parents. I don't know what else to do."

Evadne forced a smile, squeezing Suri's hand. "It's not your fault. You tried. I'll find another way."

Alone in her room, Evadne paced before dialing Elvis.

"Miss me already?" His voice was lazy but warm.

"Are you free?"

"Just finished training. What's up?"

"You're with the National Intelligence Agency, right? So investigating someone domestically would be... straightforward for you?"

"Not easy, per se. But let's just say I have my ways."

"Perfect."

Her grip on the phone tightened. "I need intel on someone. Chasel Bright—Suri's nephew, a neurosurgeon."

"I know him."

Evadne blinked. "What?"

"Classified. Can't elaborate. What do you want with him?"

"Leverage. Weaknesses. Anything to force his cooperation."

Her jaw set. "He seems like a playboy. Would a honey trap work? If necessary, I'll do it myself."

Elvis choked. "Excuse me?!"

"I need him in Elmsworth, Elvis. Whatever it takes."

"Over my dead body! If we're resorting to seduction, I'll wear the damn dress. What the hell is going on?"

Evadne pressed her lips together. "That's confidential."

Elvis groaned. Kids these days—too many secrets.

"You really think this will work?" Evadne asked, skepticism lacing her voice.

"With you? No. With me? Maybe."

She frowned. "Explain."

Elvis grinned. "Because Chasel's gay. Women don't interest him."

Evadne froze. "What?"

"If you want to bait him, send a man. A woman won't even register."

His smirk widened. "Hey, why not use Thaddeus? Broad shoulders, tight ass—he's exactly Chasel's type. One look, and the Bright heir would be drooling. Hooked in seconds."

Evadne's eye twitched.

Was this Elvis's first compliment to Thaddeus?

Weeks later, Thaddeus was discharged.

Hamilton personally collected him, avoiding the media circus. The entire ride home, his grip on Thaddeus's hand never loosened, his gaze fixed on his grandson's head.

"Grandpa, is there something on my head?" Thaddeus finally asked.

"You look good with a buzz cut." Hamilton ruffled the short strands.

"I had this in military school. They called me the handsomest cadet."

"Evadne did excellent work. The scar's barely visible."

At her name, warmth flooded Thaddeus's chest.

"Windermere or dinner with me?" Hamilton asked.

"I want to see Evadne."

Thaddeus leaned forward, anticipation lighting his dark eyes. His heart was already racing toward her.

"Good! At least you know where your wife is!"

Hamilton laughed, clapping his shoulder. "I'll take you to her. You're lucky. Don't mess it up."

Mr. Murray chuckled from the front seat.

Thaddeus's cheeks flushed. "Thank you, Grandpa. I hope you're right."

Thirty minutes later, the car stopped at the K-Orld Hotel's underground garage.

When Thaddeus strode through the lobby, his sharp buzz cut drew stunned stares from the staff.

He'd learned his lesson.

Evadne hated unannounced visits. So he approached the executive secretary politely, his calm demeanor belying his pounding heart.

"Hello. I'd like to see President Ashbourne. Could you inform her? I'll wait as long as necessary."

The secretary blinked. "Mr. Abernathy... didn't she tell you? She's no longer here."
###Chapter 333

Thaddeus's jaw dropped. "What did you just say?"

"Two days ago, there was an internal announcement at the hotel. President Ashbourne has been recalled to K Group headquarters, stepping down from her role as General Manager of the K Orld Hotel. Her new position will be determined later."

"And the hotel? What happens to it now?"

"An executive from K Orld Hotel's overseas branch will be reassigned here to take over the Elmsworth location."

The executive secretary thought of Evadne's tireless efforts and the unforgettable moments working alongside her. A satisfied smile curved her lips. "In less than a year, President Ashbourne turned this failing hotel around. She motivated the staff and achieved performance levels unseen in the past decade. Chairman Emeric is beyond pleased with her work. This recall was inevitable. With her talent, she belongs on a bigger stage—not confined to a single hotel. It would be a waste otherwise."

Thaddeus nodded in agreement.

His woman was extraordinary, capable of working miracles. Managing a mere hotel was beneath her.

Wait—that wasn’t the issue here!

The real issue was—why hadn’t Evadne told him about this?

"Where is President Ashbourne now?" Thaddeus demanded, urgency sharpening his tone.

The secretary chuckled. "How would I know her whereabouts? Mr. Thaddeus, with your influence, surely you’re not worried about finding her, are you?"

Thaddeus felt a pang of frustration.

Worried? He was practically pulling his hair out!

Skyrim, K Group Headquarters

The towering skyscraper of K Group stood proudly in the city’s most prestigious district, a landmark of power and wealth.

At three in the afternoon, employees peeked from their offices as a procession of suited executives hurried to the lobby.

News of the Ashbourne heiress’s arrival had spread like wildfire. Even the janitors knew.

"Wow, this reception is insane! Are all these people here just to greet her?"

"Even if she’s Chairman Emeric’s daughter, she’s not officially part of K Group’s leadership. Why the red carpet treatment?"

"Rumor has it she turned the Elmsworth hotel’s profits around tenfold in under a year. Chairman Emeric noticed. She’ll probably take a high-ranking position soon."

"Pfft. Who’s to say she did it alone? Maybe her brother pulled strings behind the scenes. A woman in her early twenties running a corporation? Doubtful."

"Shh—she’s here!"

In the lobby, executives stood in rigid formation, clad in identical black suits—a K Group tradition for welcoming dignitaries.

The Rolls-Royce halted at the entrance. Jason stepped out first, opening the door with practiced grace.

The first to emerge was Cassius, tall and imposing.

"Good afternoon, President!" Two executives bowed deeply.

Cassius acknowledged them with a nod before extending his hand toward the car, his lips curving into a doting smile.

"Evadne."

"Coming."

A pair of slender legs in black-and-gold heels stepped out, the hem of her skirt swaying with each movement. Her porcelain skin seemed to glow. Any man would feel his pulse quicken at the sight.

Evadne placed her hand in her brother’s as she descended.

"Good afternoon, Miss Ashbourne!"

She inclined her head slightly. "Apologies for the wait. It’s chilly out—let’s head inside."

The moment the siblings appeared, they commanded attention, drawing murmurs of admiration.

"She’s stunning. A thousand times more beautiful in person than on TV!"

"Even with President Cassius standing right there, I can’t take my eyes off her. She’s the kind of beauty who could make anyone fall for her."

Skepticism melted away the second Evadne stepped into view. Without lifting a finger, she’d already won over a crowd.

"Welcome, Miss Ashbourne!"

The executives bowed in unison as Evadne and Cassius strode forward, gazes fixed ahead.

"Would you like a tour of the headquarters first?" Cassius asked softly, his smile warm.

"Later. I want to see my new office." Evadne smirked, poking his arm discreetly.

Cassius’s eyes softened. "As you wish."

They moved toward the elevators, Jason trailing behind.

"My dear niece and nephew!"

The siblings turned.

A polished middle-aged man approached, grinning broadly, flanked by his secretary and subordinates.

"Uncle Bevis." Evadne offered a languid smile.

Bevis Ashbourne, Emeric’s younger brother and K Group’s vice-chairman, lacked his brother’s striking looks but exuded charm. Where Emeric was stern, Bevis was affable, always wearing a smile.

"Evadne! More breathtaking every time I see you!"

"You’ve aged remarkably well yourself, Uncle."

"Still as sweet as ever!"

Bevis turned to Cassius. "Showing Evadne her office? I heard from Emeric she’s joining the company. Which department? I’ve got time—I could give her a proper tour."

Cassius remained composed. "Father will decide her position. We’ll inform you once it’s settled."

"Ah, of course. Looking forward to it."

Bevis suddenly brightened. "Oh! Dolores left a gift for you in your office. Don’t forget to check it out."

Dolores, Bevis’s daughter and Evadne’s cousin, had always been close to her despite their infrequent meetings.

"How thoughtful of her." Evadne’s smile didn’t reach her eyes.

They continued toward the office.

"Miss Evadne, what’s that?" Jason pointed ahead.

Two massive wreaths adorned her office entrance. Passing employees whispered, stifling laughter.

"Uncle Bevis," Cassius said coldly, "is this Dolores’s idea of a welcome?"

Bevis’s smile faltered. The wreaths bore his daughter’s unmistakable signature.

"Ah, you know Dolores—straightforward as ever! In Oldrun, wreaths are traditional for celebrations."

"We’re not in Oldrun. Does she lack common sense?" Cassius retorted.

Evadne, surprisingly, waved it off. "Everyone has their customs. K Group employs thousands—we can’t cater to all."

Cassius nodded. "Evadne’s right."

Bevis’s irritation simmered. His daughter was an Ashbourne too, with equal standing in the company. Their condescension grated.

"Jason, remove these, please." Evadne sighed. "No offense, Uncle. I appreciate the gesture, but I’d hate for Dolores to be embarrassed by her… questionable taste."

Subordinates bit back laughter. Bevis’s smile turned rigid.

Inside the office, Evadne sank onto the couch, arms crossed. "Dolores is picking a fight before I’ve even started."

Cassius exhaled. "She’s been competing with you since kindergarten and never wins. At this point, it’s just pathetic."

"If she crosses me, family ties won’t save her." Her eyes darkened.

Cassius nodded. "You’ve never backed down. But remember—this is a different battlefield. Uncle Bevis has allies here. Father indulges him as his only brother. Tread carefully."

"I know."

Evadne’s gaze, deep and unreadable, hardened with resolve. "If they stay in line, we’ll coexist peacefully. But if they scheme against me, I won’t hesitate to destroy them."

Cassius arched a brow. "Little sister, don’t forget—Uncle Bevis is Vice Chairman."

Evadne lifted her chin. "And Father is Chairman. Who should be afraid of whom?"

"By the way," Cassius said suddenly, "did you tell Thaddeus you’re leaving the hotel?"

Evadne blinked, touching her lips. "Why would I? Who does he think he is?"

Cassius smirked. "Fair point."

Just then, her phone buzzed.

Her pulse jumped. Please don’t be him. The irony would be unbearable.

She checked the screen.

Avery’s name flashed back at her.

Cassius glanced at the phone, expressionless, though his brow twitched.

He’d have preferred Thaddeus.

"Ave?" Evadne answered neutrally.

"Evadne, I’m in Skyrim."

Avery’s voice was tender, the sound of sea breeze faint in the background. "You must be here too. Are you free? I’d like to see you."

Evadne checked her watch. "Now?"

"If you’re busy, I’ll wait. However long it takes."
###Chapter 334

Opposite the towering K Group headquarters.

Isabella Sinclair rested against the sleek hood of his sports car, hands tucked into his tailored trousers. The fading sunset painted him in golden hues as his somber gaze remained fixed on the building's entrance.

He had been waiting.

Waiting for Evelyn Prescott to reach out—even a single text would have sufficed.

But silence was his only answer, confirming what he already knew.

The woman he loved had no room for him in her heart.

Yet, he was certain she still held a flame for Alexander Kingsley. The scars of their divorce kept them apart, but denial couldn't erase the truth.

The thought darkened his expression. Adjusting his gold-rimmed glasses, he exhaled sharply, his entire presence radiating a chilling aura that even the warm light couldn't soften.

"Alex."

The sweet voice shattered his gloom. His lips curved into a smile as warm as a summer breeze.

"Evelyn. You finally came."

She approached with quick, confident steps, hands clasped behind her back, tilting her head playfully. "Finally? Did I keep you waiting? You just got here, didn't you?"

Her carefree demeanor mirrored the girl who had pulled him from darkness fifteen years ago.

Every time he saw her, his gaze lingered, captivated—not by mere beauty, but by the light she carried.

"I've been waiting much longer," he admitted, a trace of bitterness in his voice. "Ever since we met at Margaret's birthday party. I've been hoping to see you again."

Evelyn hesitated.

She remembered leaving abruptly that night, without a proper goodbye to him or Mrs. Vanderbilt.

Rude, indeed.

"Sorry about that. You know what happened. It was chaos. I had to get to my family."

"You owe me an apology, Evelyn." His tone turned serious.

She blinked. "Huh?"

"You were in trouble. Why didn't you ask for my help?"

He stepped closer, his voice low and rough with reproach. "Don't you trust me? Do you think I couldn't have handled it?"

"That's not it, Alex."

"I hate that I wasn't fast enough that day. If I had been, I could've been the one protecting you." His breath hitched, pain flickering in his dark eyes.

"No, no. That iron rod would've cracked your skull open."

She waved her hands frantically, uncomfortable under his intense stare. "Alexander took the hit because he could handle it. You didn't need to."

"Why him and not me?" His voice strained, eyes reddening. "Do you think only he can protect you?"

Evelyn leaned back slightly, startled by his intensity. "That's not what I meant. I don't want you hurt either. Why would you insist on getting hurt for me?"

A rare warmth bloomed in his chest. His gaze softened. "Evelyn... do you care about me?"

Her pulse stuttered.

The question echoed too familiarly—Alexander had asked the same thing, over and over, after their divorce. She'd always retaliated with sharp words, leaving him bruised.

Yet, deep down, it had always ached.

But when Alex asked, she felt nothing but calm. The contrast was telling.

"If it were you, I might not have been able to save you," she deflected quickly. "Alexander has a freakishly strong constitution. His survival rate was higher. If it were you, I might've failed. Wouldn't you resent me forever?"

His smile faded, a weight settling in his chest.

"Anyway, welcome to New York. Let me treat you to dinner tonight." She offered a bright smile, not wanting his trip to be wasted.

"Come back to Elmsworth with me," he countered, eyes alight. "Dinner there. And... there's a place I want to take you. I think you'll love it."

She hesitated, then nodded.

Not because she particularly wanted to go, but because she needed to return anyway—to meet Adrian and uncover who had framed Margaret.

Dinner was pleasant, though Evelyn's mind wandered, worry flickering in her eyes.

"Has Margaret's situation not been resolved yet?" Alex sipped his tea, watching her closely.

"That thug is still in custody. He confessed to everything." Her grip tightened around her cup.

"Any leads?"

The question made her tense. "Why? Do you know something?"

He smirked, tapping his phone screen swiftly.

Ding. Ding. Ding.

Evelyn checked her phone, eyes widening at the photos—detailed records of the attacker.

"This man was a stagehand twenty years ago, then a stunt double," Alex explained casually, refilling her tea. "An accident broke his leg, ending his career. He's lived in poverty ever since."

She recalled his limping gait when arrested.

"Back then, Margaret and Alexander's stepmother, Victoria, were rival actresses. Constant competition. On Margaret's birthday, Victoria moved her own celebration to the same day, hoping to steal the spotlight. Instead, all her guests went to Margaret's party. Even Mr. Hamilton publicly snubbed her."

He arched a brow, smile sharp. "Think she might hold a grudge?"

Evelyn exhaled slowly. "Honestly, Victoria was my first suspect. But I had no proof."

Alex sent more photos.

"What's this?"

"His apartment."

The images showed a grim, cluttered space—walls plastered with Victoria's old posters, like a shrine to obsession.

"That man worships her. Motive enough?"

Evelyn gaped. "You had someone break into his place?"

He dabbed his lips with a napkin, unfazed. "Simple task. No thanks needed."

"That's illegal."

His smile turned icy. "Does someone who nearly destroyed your family deserve rights? He's no better than an animal."

Fair point.

After dinner, Evelyn excused herself to the restroom.

Her phone buzzed on the table.

Alex glanced at it, then slid it toward himself with one finger.

He answered silently.

"Evelyn? Can you talk now? Evelyn?"

Alexander's voice, tender and hopeful.

Alex smirked and hung up.

The phone rang again instantly.

With a quiet chuckle, he blocked the number and returned the phone to its place.

"Ready?" Evelyn reappeared, lips freshly glossed, skin glowing.

Alex swallowed, offering a warm smile. "Let's go."

She settled into his passenger seat as they sped east.

"Where are we going?"

"You'll see."

Twenty minutes later, they arrived at a pristine equestrian center.

"A riding club?" Her eyes sparkled.

"Remember when we were kids in New York? You'd sneak me into your family's stables to feed the horses?" His smile turned nostalgic.

"You were terrified to touch them!" She laughed.

He chuckled ruefully.

He hadn't been scared—just fastidious about dirt.

"This is a Vanderbilt Group property. Just finished construction, not open yet."

After parking, they approached the entrance.

"Stop!" Two guards blocked them. "Private property. No visitors."

Evelyn blinked, glancing at Alex, whose expression remained blank.

Everyone knew Reginald and Oliver Vanderbilt. But him? Denied entry.

The injustice burned, even for her.

"Evelyn, I'm sorry." His smile was bitter. "Our first outing in so long, and this happens."
###Chapter 335

Evadne felt no embarrassment—only indignation on Avery's behalf.

She was a woman of strong principles, never one to look down on others. That wasn't how she'd been raised.

"No big deal. If we're not allowed in, we'll come back when it's open." She shrugged. "Let's go."

Not wanting to cause trouble for Avery, she casually suggested, "If you want to ride, you can come to my family's ranch. It's just as good."

But as she turned to leave, Avery caught her hand, his grip firm but gentle. "Evadne, don't go. We need to get in there tonight."

Her fingers twitched, instinctively trying to pull away, but his hold was unyielding.

His tone left no room for argument.

This was a side of him she hadn't seen since they'd reconnected.

The two bouncers exchanged glances before one sneered, "Leave now, or don't blame us for being rough. Mr. Byron is entertaining guests inside. No riffraff allowed."

Evadne nearly rolled her eyes.

Riffraff? They must not have brushed their teeth—their words stank.

"Oh, really?"

Avery remained composed. He stepped forward. "What if I insist on going in?"

"Looking for trouble?"

One bouncer lunged at him, ready to shove him back.

But before his hand could even graze Avery's shirt, there was a blur of movement—then a sharp cry of pain as the man hit the ground, writhing.

Evadne's eyes widened.

Avery had flipped him effortlessly.

The second bouncer charged—only to meet the same fate.

"Evadne, let's go."

Avery pulled out a pristine handkerchief, wiping his hands with deliberate grace. His voice was soft, his demeanor that of a refined gentleman—as if the violence moments ago had never happened.

Evadne was speechless.

Avery's lips curved into a tender smile. He reached for her hand again, leading her away without hesitation.

"Wait—who the hell are you?" the fallen bouncer gasped.

Avery paused, chuckling lightly. "My name is Chambers."

The color drained from their faces.

Meanwhile, Thaddeus sat in his luxury car, gripping his phone, anxiety gnawing at him.

"Mr. Thaddeus, still no luck reaching Mrs. Abernathy?" Gordon asked nervously.

"No. Even when she despises me, she never ignores my calls." His palm was slick with sweat, his expression tight with worry. "Gordon, did I do something to upset her? My memory's been spotty since the injury. Help me think—did I say or do anything wrong?"

Gordon blinked at the usually unshakable CEO, now reduced to anxious uncertainty.

"Uh... you haven't seen Mrs. Abernathy in days. No chance to upset her, right?" He scratched his head. "Unless... she had a bad dream about you and woke up furious?"

Thaddeus shot him a withering look. "A dream?"

Gordon nodded sagely. "Happened to me once. My college girlfriend dreamed I cheated and gave me hell for a week. We broke up soon after."

Thaddeus's expression darkened. "You think my wife is as irrational as the women you dated?"

Gordon paled. "N-no, sir! Of course not!"

Thaddeus exhaled sharply.

How could he control what she dreamed?

But he had been a monster in the past. The scars he'd left on her heart ran deep.

"Maybe try President Ashbourne?" Gordon ventured. "Since Mrs. Abernathy returned to Skyrim, her brother must know where she is."

Thaddeus glared. "As CEO of the Abernathy Group, I can't find one person and have to call her family? What if Cassius doesn't know either? Should I phone all her brothers one by one?" He waved a hand. "Get out."

Gordon fled.

The moment the door closed, Thaddeus dialed Cassius.

"Mr. Thaddeus. How's the injury?" Cassius's voice was calm, revealing nothing.

"President Ashbourne, is Evadne with you?" Thaddeus's urgency bled through.

"She's not. Can't you reach my sister?"

"No. I've called repeatedly. No answer."

"Ah. That's normal."

Thaddeus clenched his jaw.

"I don't know where she is either. She's an adult—she doesn't report to me. There was a time she cut off the family for years because of you."

"Because of me?" Thaddeus stiffened. "Why?"

Cassius caught his slip. "Mr. Thaddeus, is this urgent? Are you feeling unwell?"

"No. I'm just... worried."

"Don't be. Evadne always knows how to take care of herself. If she's avoiding you, she has her reasons."

The words were a needle to Thaddeus's heart—sharp, subtle, the pain spreading relentlessly. He hung up, lost in thought.

But Cassius's slip intrigued him.

She'd cut off her family for years—just as he had.

So where had she been during that time? What had she done? And why had she never mentioned it?

At the ranch, Avery still held Evadne's hand.

"Ave? Ave? Mr. Avery!"

It took three calls before he snapped back to reality. "Hm?"

Her lips pursed. She gave him a pointed look, then lowered her gaze to their joined hands.

"Sorry." His fingers loosened reluctantly.

The air grew awkward.

They were both adults, single, unattached. She'd been married before. A touch shouldn't be a big deal.

Right?

Evadne took a breath and addressed it head-on. "Why didn't you just reveal who you were earlier? No need for violence."

"Would it have helped?" Avery smiled faintly. "They'd have called my brother. Same outcome."

She didn't press further. The Chambers brothers' feud wasn't her business.

"Ave, why bring me here? To ride?"

"To see a horse. You'll love it."

As he spoke, he instinctively reached for her hand again—then stopped, fingers hovering midair.

Evadne's pulse skipped.

Just then, Avery's secretary rushed over, panting.

"Mr. Chambers! Trouble!"

Avery frowned. "What?"

"Your horse—the one for Ms. Evadne—Mr. Byron took it to the ranch!"

Avery's glasses glinted coldly. His expression darkened like a gathering storm.

Meanwhile, Byron was showing off a magnificent champagne-coated stallion to his guests.

"Byron, this is a real thoroughbred! Only heard of them, never seen one!"

"Must be worth at least a million, right?"

"Lowballing it," Byron scoffed, stroking the horse's sleek coat. "This is a rare Whiteguard breed. Worth 1.5 million, minimum."

Gasps of awe followed. Phones came out for pictures.

1.5 million was pocket change for this crowd—but spending it on a horse? Only the Abernathy, Chambers, or Ashbourne families could afford such extravagance.

"Let me ride it! I want to feel its power!"

Byron eagerly mounted—just as a cold voice cut through the air.

"Who said you could touch my things?"

Startled, Byron lost his balance and tumbled off.

The trainer caught him, but the humiliation burned.

"Careful, Byron!" The crowd feigned concern, secretly amused.

Byron shoved the trainer aside and whirled—only to freeze.

Avery and Evadne stood side by side, a striking pair that commanded attention.

"Who's that woman? Gorgeous—and familiar!"

"That's Evadne Ashbourne! Daughter of Skyrim's richest man!"

"And the man beside her... damn, they look good together."

"That's Avery Chambers. Didn't know he was close to the Ashbournes. Must be powerful."

Byron's face twisted with rage at being upstaged.

Evadne ignored him, her gaze locked on the golden stallion. "So beautiful," she breathed.

Avery watched her, lips curving as her eyes sparkled, cheeks flushed like peach blossoms.

"What are you doing here, Avery?" Byron forced a smile, dusting himself off.

"Checking on my horse. Enjoy showing off with stolen goods?" Avery tilted his head, mocking. "You could've asked. But taking it? What does that make you?"

Byron flushed.

"Even if you had asked," Avery added coolly, "I'd have said no."
###Chapter 336

Byron's face drained of color, turning an unsettling shade of green at the words.

The crowd stood frozen in shock.

Mr. Avery's tone was sharp, deliberate, laced with provocation.

Whispers broke out among the guests.

"Seems like there's no love lost between the Chambers brothers."

"No love? More like open warfare!"

"Did Mr. Avery just imply the horse was his? Did Byron really take his brother's property without asking?"

"That doesn't sound right, does it?"

The murmurs reached Byron's ears, his jaw clenching as he fought to keep his fury in check. "Avery, it's just a horse. Was this spectacle necessary?" he snapped coldly.

"Absolutely."

Avery's reply was ice, his piercing gaze matching his tone. "If it were just a horse, I wouldn't care. But you laid hands on a gift meant for Miss Evadne before she even saw it. Do you find that acceptable?"

Evadne, still dazzled by the sight of the prized stallion, stiffened at his words.

"Byron, have you forgotten all decency over the years?"

Avery didn't hold back, his mockery cutting deep, brotherhood be damned. "Didn't our father teach you that stealing is beneath you?"

Byron felt the sting of a public slap, his composure crumbling.

The embarrassment over the horse was one thing. But with Evadne watching, the humiliation burned a thousand times hotter, his pulse roaring in his ears, blood boiling with unchecked rage.

"If the horse was meant for Miss Evadne, why was it tied here? I assumed it belonged to the Chambers stables. As a Chambers, I have every right to take it."

Avery adjusted his glasses, a smirk playing on his lips. "So if you're tied up here, does that mean I can drag you away too?"

"You—"

Laughter erupted from the crowd, turning Byron's face scarlet. He lunged forward, fists clenched, only stopped by his secretary's restraining grip.

"Avery, let it go. It's not worth ruining the evening over."

Evadne's fingers brushed Avery's arm, her voice soft but firm. "We shouldn't disrupt Byron's event. Let's go."

"Fine."

Avery's reply was quiet, but his grip on the stallion's reins was firm as he led Evadne away under the crowd's watchful eyes.

In that moment, he looked every bit the knight, strolling under the moonlight with his princess.

Byron seethed. Avery's public humiliation was bad enough. But seeing him walk off with Evadne, as if he didn't exist? Unbearable.

In the lounge, Byron downed a glass of whiskey and shattered it against the wall.

"That bastard. Over a damn horse, he dares to humiliate me!"

"Mr. Byron, his arrogance isn't about the horse," his secretary said carefully. "It's about having the perfect excuse to shame you publicly."

Byron's glare could have burned through steel. "Are you saying I handed him that excuse?"

"No! I'm just—I'm furious on your behalf! You're the one Mr. Jeff chose for the Ashbourne alliance!"

"I don't need your anger. I need a solution!"

His hands trembled, his breathing ragged. The secretary hastily poured another drink. The whiskey steadied him, smoothing the tremors, masking the truth—that the poised man the world saw relied on liquor to keep his demons at bay.

"He made you uncomfortable. Return the favor. At the very least, don't let his date with Miss Evadne go smoothly."

A dark glint flashed in Byron's eyes. After a beat, he motioned his secretary closer.

"I have a plan. Make it happen. Now."

Thaddeus was unraveling.

No word from Evadne. No answers from Cassius. His mind was chaos, his pulse erratic, a swarm of thoughts buzzing relentlessly.

"Mr. Thaddeus, Mr. Frederic expects you at tonight's gala. It's your first public appearance since your recovery. The team needs to see you're well."

Gordon, ever efficient, laid out the facts. "You're the CEO. Your presence reassures them."

Thaddeus stared blankly at his silent phone.

"Mr. Thaddeus, love shouldn't consume you."

Gordon sighed. "I know you're worried about Mrs. Abernathy, but she's a capable woman with powerful allies. What could possibly happen? You were never this irrational. A man must prioritize his career."

"You think putting her first is wrong?"

Gordon swallowed hard. "That's not what I meant."

"I used to be a machine. Work was everything. I had a wife, but she was never my priority. I thought without my position, I'd have nothing."

Thaddeus closed his eyes, lashes trembling. "But when I lost Evadne, I realized the truth. Without her, I have nothing."

He exhaled sharply. "None of it means anything."

"Mr. Thaddeus, you once told me you climbed to the top—knowing it's lonely—because power protects those you love. You wanted to honor your late mother!"

The mention of his mother's death twisted like a knife.

"And yet, you're so focused on winning Mrs. Abernathy back, you're neglecting everything else. What happens if you end up beneath her? A kept man? Is that how you want to live?"

Thaddeus's jaw tightened.

Harsh words. But not wrong.

"Get the car. We're leaving."

"This breed is the Ferrari of horses—Whiteguard's treasure. I begged my father for one, but he was too afraid I'd get hurt."

Under the moonlight, Evadne ran her fingers through the stallion's golden mane, its warmth sending a thrill through her.

Suddenly, her mind conjured Thaddeus—bare-chested, muscles taut, wild and untamed.

Her fingertips tingled. Cheeks flushed.

That man, when he let go, was just as untamable as this stallion.

"Evadne, do you like it? Evadne?"

"Huh?"

She blinked, touching her heated face. "I do. Horses have always been my favorite."

Damn it. Why does everything remind me of him?

Avery stepped closer, his shadow enveloping her.

"I remember," he murmured, studying her delicate profile. "You told me as a child you wanted to be an equestrian. That was your dream."

"It was."

She smiled faintly. "But dreams change. I know now I wasn't cut out for it."

She didn't mind Avery bringing up their past, even if some memories were hazy.

But the difference between them was clear—she looked forward. He clung to the past.

"Evadne, what's your dream now?"

Avery's voice was tight, his breath uneven.

"For a long time, I wanted to be a great doctor."

She couldn't fight beside Thaddeus, but she could be his support. She'd always prayed he'd return safely—but if he didn't, she wanted to be the one to mend his wounds.

"Now? I don't have one."

Her chest ached, the admission bitter. "Now, I just want everything handed to me. To sit back and enjoy. To have it all without lifting a finger."

Avery's lips curved. "Evadne, can you read minds?"

His breath warmed her ear. "We're thinking the same thing."

She arched a brow. "You're a grown man, not even thirty, and you want to be a kept man? That's not very ambitious."

"You misunderstand." His voice dropped, desire darkening his gaze. "I want my future wife to live without a single worry. Her only job? To stay as beautiful as a rose."

He leaned closer. "Being my woman means having everything. No struggles. No wandering. Only a weak man lets his woman suffer."

Evadne's breath hitched. Was that a jab at someone?

Before she could respond, a deafening neigh shattered the quiet.

"Mr. Chambers! Miss Evadne! Look out!"

A gust of wind kicked up dust.

Evadne whirled around—just as a black stallion burst through the fence, charging straight for them!
###Chapter 337

Isabella's breath caught in her throat as her entire body went rigid, her lips trembling in shock.

She wasn't slow to react—but the attack came without warning. A massive, muscular stallion was charging straight at her, its hooves pounding the ground like a speeding bullet.

Human reflexes weren't built for this.

"Mr. Kingsley!"

The secretary's voice cracked with panic as he shouted for Alexander, but it was already too late.

The horse, eyes wild and nostrils flaring, was mere feet away from trampling Isabella.

Her legs locked in place, frozen by sheer terror.

"Isabella!"

Alexander lunged forward, wrapping his arms around her and yanking her out of harm's way just as the beast thundered past.

They crashed onto the ground in a tangle of limbs, dust swirling around them.

Alexander took the brunt of the impact, shielding Isabella with his body. Aside from a few scrapes, she was unharmed.

But the force of the fall sent a sharp jolt through her, twisting her stomach into knots.

If she was feeling this shaken, how much worse was it for him?

"Alex! Are you okay?" Her voice trembled, eyes glistening with unshed tears.

"I'm—watch out!"

His face paled as he tightened his grip on her, rolling them both aside just as the horse reared up again, hooves slashing the air where they'd been seconds before.

A pained groan escaped Alexander as sweat drenched his suit.

"Alex!"

Her chest constricted, making it hard to breathe.

Finally, the secretary and two trainers managed to subdue the frenzied animal, injecting it with a sedative. The horse's wild thrashing slowed, its crazed gaze dulling.

"Mr. Kingsley! Mr. Kingsley!"

The secretary rushed over, face ashen. Seeing Alexander still on the ground, he turned on the trainers.

"How could you let this happen?" he snarled. "If Mr. Kingsley is seriously hurt, I swear you'll both pay for it!"

The trainers cowered, unable to defend themselves.

"Enough about me—get him medical attention!" Isabella ordered, wiping sweat from her brow.

She checked Alexander for injuries, her doctor's instincts kicking in.

"Where does it hurt? Describe the pain while you're still conscious!"

Despite the agony, the corner of his mouth lifted. "Seeing you worry over me like this... makes the pain worth it."

"Alexander, this isn't the time for jokes!" she snapped, frustration and fear sharpening her tone.

He bit back another wince. "My arm and back... mostly my arm."

Her fingers found the fracture instantly.

Guilt twisted inside her as she recalled the moment he'd thrown himself between her and danger.

"It's fine, Isabella," he murmured, voice soft.

"Fine? Your arm is broken!" Her eyes burned, voice breaking.

Even now, injured because of her, he was the one comforting her.

"Don't worry. I'll take care of you." His gaze held hers, steady. "If a bone is broken, I'll mend it. If all your bones were broken, I'd fix every single one. I promise."

I'll take care of everything.

The words wrapped around her like warmth.

No one had ever said that to him before.

But Isabella had. And that was just one of the countless reasons he adored her.

"This doesn't make sense," one trainer muttered, scratching his head. "This horse is the gentlest in the stable. It's skittish, sure, but never violent. What could've set it off?"

The secretary shot him a glare. "You're asking us? Figure it out!"

"Horses only react like this when they're severely frightened," Isabella said, frowning.

"But how?" the other trainer protested. "It was resting in its stall all day. No one went near it. Nothing happened."

At that, both Isabella and Alexander exchanged a grim look.

Meanwhile, at the Sinclair Convention Center, the elite mingled under glittering chandeliers.

Frederic Sinclair stood among business titans, wine glass in hand, engaged in polite conversation.

"Mr. Sinclair! It's been too long!"

Frederic turned to see Bevis approaching, champagne in hand and a practiced smile in place.

"Ah, Bevis. Good to see you." His response was cool, bordering on indifferent.

Despite being Emeric's younger brother and Vice Chairman of K Group, Bevis held little real power. The company's shares and assets remained firmly in Emeric's control—soon to be passed to Cassius, his eldest son.

Bevis was, at best, a placeholder.

The business world worshipped power, and Frederic had no patience for those without it.

"Bevis, where's Emeric tonight? Did you come alone?" another guest asked.

"My brother is... preoccupied with family matters," Bevis sighed, feigning concern. "His wife, Myra, hasn't been well lately. You've heard the rumors, I'm sure. Emeric fears she might do something drastic, so he refuses to leave her side."

Frederic's expression remained neutral, but his grip tightened slightly on his glass.

"Such a shame," someone murmured. "Those rumors are ancient history. Who would dredge them up now?"

"Jealousy, plain and simple," another scoffed. "She's beautiful, wealthy, adored—of course people would try to tear her down."

Frederic's jaw clenched.

Though no names were mentioned, the implication pricked at him.

"Emeric is a man of honor," a guest remarked.

"Indeed. Myra was just an actress when they married, yet he's stood by her all these years. That speaks volumes."

Bevis's smile stiffened.

He'd hoped to invite ridicule, but instead, his brother was being praised.

Pathetic sycophants.

Frederic checked his watch, scanning the room for Thaddeus.

"Mr. Sinclair, such an important event tonight—where is Thaddeus?" Bevis pressed.

"He'll be here shortly."

"Excellent!" Bevis's eyes lit up. "Actually, K Group has a promising environmental project. My brother assigned it to me, and we're seeking partners."

He launched into a pitch, and Frederic nodded politely, though his attention was elsewhere.

"My daughter, Arabella, has drafted two solid proposals. She'll be joining us later. After the gala, I've arranged a private meeting. You and Thaddeus should attend—we can discuss further."

Frederic's brow furrowed. "Your daughter?"

"Yes, Arabella. Just four months younger than Evadne. Graduated top of her class at Oxford, worked as a translator for the Prime Minister. Now she's K Group's Director of Product Design—earned the position on merit, of course."

The nearby guests exchanged knowing glances.

On merit? Please.

"She sounds... accomplished," Frederic said flatly.

"Then it's settled! I'll arrange everything after the gala."

Frederic blinked.

Settled? When did I agree?

He wasn't senile. Bevis's "business discussion" was clearly a thinly veiled setup—an excuse to parade his daughter in front of Thaddeus.

"Bevis, my father never agreed to anything."

A chill swept through the room as Thaddeus strode forward, his icy gaze cutting through the crowd.

"Thaddeus! There you are." Frederic exhaled in relief.

Bevis's smile faltered.

"If you were serious about business," Thaddeus said coolly, "you'd have scheduled a proper meeting. Not ambushed us at a social event."

"Mr. Sinclair, I merely thought—"

"And if your real goal was to introduce your daughter?" Thaddeus's voice turned glacial. "Save your breath. I don't participate in matchmaking games."
###Chapter 338

The room fell into stunned silence.

Mr. Alexander Kingsley certainly didn’t mince words.

The business moguls, despite their practiced poker faces, couldn’t help but shoot disdainful glances at Nathaniel Prescott.

Honestly, if he wanted to discuss business, then discuss business. But to suddenly extend an invitation and insist on including his daughter—his intentions were as transparent as glass!

Nathaniel, however, clearly hadn’t expected Alexander to be so brutally direct. The moment his scheming thoughts surfaced, Alexander crushed them without hesitation.

Nathaniel, usually a master of masking his emotions, struggled to maintain his smile, his expression stiffening by the second.

"Mr. Kingsley, you're absolutely right. My apologies for the abruptness. I should have sent a formal invitation. I was just so thrilled to see Mr. Frederic tonight."

"If you're thrilled to see my father, then invite him. He’s the Chairman of the Kingsley Group. You can speak to him directly."

Alexander shot Nathaniel an icy glare before shifting his gaze, his tone dropping even colder. "I do wonder, does Chairman Reginald know you’re negotiating with the Kingsley Group behind his back?"

Nathaniel froze, then forced a laugh. "My brother entrusted me with this project. Of course, I’d prioritize partnering with a powerhouse like the Kingsley Group. If he knew we were collaborating, he’d be overjoyed and fully supportive."

Alexander smirked, his eyes sharp as blades. "And if Chairman Reginald knew you were privately approaching the ex-husband of Miss Isabella Sinclair, would he still be overjoyed?"

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

Frederic’s brows furrowed deeply as he reprimanded, "Alexander, must you bring this up here?"

Nathaniel’s mouth hung open, his mind racing.

Ex-husband?

Alexander Kingsley was Isabella’s ex-husband?

When had they married? When had they divorced? The Sinclair family kept their secrets well.

"Some things are better said outright to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings."

Alexander’s voice was frigid. "Aside from Chairman Reginald and Miss Sinclair, I won’t discuss business with anyone else from the Vanderbilt Group. And I certainly won’t meet any woman privately behind Isabella’s back—not even your daughter. I won’t risk upsetting her over something so trivial."

The crowd erupted in murmurs. This was practically a public love confession!

Frederic cleared his throat, shooting his son a warning look. "Alexander, there’s no need to be so blunt."

"I had no idea you and Isabella shared such a history. My apologies for the oversight."

Nathaniel forced another laugh. "Though you’re divorced, it’s admirable how deeply you still care for her. A man of honor indeed!"

"The marriage ended. The feelings didn’t."

Alexander’s thoughts drifted to Isabella—her radiant smile, those mesmerizing eyes. His expression softened. "I love Isabella. Even divorced, I’ll win her back someday."

Nathaniel paled, humiliation burning his cheeks.

The party continued, and Nathaniel slipped into the hallway to answer a call from his daughter, Victoria.

"Dad, have you arrived at the event?"

"I’ve been here. Where are you? Why aren’t you here yet?" Nathaniel’s mood was foul after Alexander’s humiliation.

"Oh, tonight’s too important. I had to look perfect before making my entrance."

Victoria’s voice brightened. "Has Mr. Kingsley arrived?"

"He’s here."

"Did you mention the new project? Make sure he knows the proposal was my idea!"

Victoria laughed arrogantly. "A man like Alexander Kingsley has seen countless beauties. But someone like me—educated, cultured, brilliant, with a prestigious family name—will stand out. Once he notices me, he’ll be drawn to my intellect. And then, he’ll fall for me."

Her tone suggested she’d already won him over, inching closer to the Kingsley fortune.

"Don’t celebrate just yet," Nathaniel muttered darkly.

"Dad, what do you mean?"

"Alexander’s been divorced before."

"What? Divorced? When?" Victoria gasped.

"You’re asking me? I have no idea. But that’s not the point. Do you know who his ex-wife is?"

Of course, Victoria wouldn’t know. She’d spent the year buried in studies and research in Paris, focused on her own reinvention.

"Your cousin. Isabella Sinclair!" Nathaniel spat the name through gritted teeth.

Silence. Only shallow breathing filled the line.

Then Victoria burst into mocking laughter. "Oh, Dad, you’re joking, right? Isabella’s father worships her. He’d throw a parade for her wedding. How could she marry in secret? To the CEO of Kingsley Group? That wedding would’ve been legendary!"

"I don’t know the details, but Alexander is divorced now."

"So what if he’s divorced? Even eight times over, he’d still be the crown prince. The divorce wasn’t his fault—it was Isabella’s. She couldn’t keep a man like him."

Victoria sneered. "Honestly, it’s better this way. Isabella’s a discarded woman now. She won’t be in my way. I’ll have even more to mock her about when I see her."

"Alexander just admitted in front of everyone that he still loves her. He wants her back! If you’re aiming for him, it won’t be easy."

"Men care about pride. When you and Mom divorced, you were keeping mistresses, yet you played the devoted husband in front of Uncle Reginald."

"A man like Alexander, with his status, has to maintain appearances. Divorce isn’t exactly flattering." Victoria sounded dismissive.

Nathaniel seethed. "Ungrateful girl! Haven’t I given you everything? The half-million you blew on surgeries and starlets in Paris last year—who covered that? Me! If you don’t appreciate me, fine. But keep your mouth shut unless you want your cards canceled."

"Oh, Dad, I was just teasing. My loyalty’s always with you."

Victoria laughed, brimming with arrogance. "You want repayment? Watch me. Once I get close to Alexander, your daughter will be the future Mrs. Kingsley."

Meanwhile, the event moved to its next highlight—the keynote speech by Elmsworth’s business titan.

Originally, Frederic was to deliver it, but with Alexander present, he passed the spotlight to his son. After all, Alexander’s recent injury required public appearances to quell damaging rumors.

"You showed up tonight without dressing up—fine. But you couldn’t even bother to style your hair?"

Frederic shot him a disapproving look. "What CEO sports a buzz cut? You’re not in the military anymore. And with those surgery scars? At least wear a wig."

"I’m not hiding my injury. Everyone in Elmsworth knows. Covering it would raise suspicions. Besides, what’s wrong with a buzz cut? I’d still look good bald." Alexander’s tone was cool, dripping with confidence.

Frederic pressed his lips together.

As much as he disapproved of his son’s defiance, he couldn’t deny Alexander inherited his parents’ striking looks. The man was effortlessly handsome.

"I’ll have a realistic wig made for you tomorrow," Frederic insisted.

It wasn’t about the wig. He simply couldn’t stand Alexander’s defiance. Control was all he craved.

"Do what you want. I won’t wear it. Isabella likes my hair like this. As long as she does, I’m keeping it." At the mention of Isabella, Alexander’s voice softened, warmth seeping in.

"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Mr. Alexander Kingsley!"

Applause erupted.

Alexander rose gracefully, ignoring Frederic’s glare, and strode to the stage.

Standing before the microphone, poised and commanding, he showed no trace of his recent surgery—only vitality and strength.

Just as he began to speak, his phone vibrated.

Normally, he’d ignore it. But tonight, his beloved was missing. He’d kept his phone close all evening, terrified of missing her call.

So when it buzzed, his heart lurched.

He discreetly checked the screen.

Instantly, his pupils contracted.

The photos flooding in sent his pulse skyrocketing, his heart hammering wildly against his ribs.

Without hesitation, he spun on his heel and sprinted offstage, leaving the bewildered crowd in his wake.

Murmurs spread. "What’s happening?"

Frederic shot to his feet. "What the hell is he doing?"

Lawrence, stationed by the back door, panicked and chased after Alexander.

Outside the banquet hall, Alexander moved swiftly, his face pale, his strides urgent.

Then, a vision in white Chanel appeared—long flowing hair, delicate features, poised like a blooming rose.

Victoria Prescott.

Seeing Alexander charging toward her, she fluttered her lashes, lifting a hand in greeting. "Mr. Kingsley."

"Move."

"Ah!"

He brushed past her like a hurricane, his shoulder knocking into hers. The impact sent her stumbling, pain shooting through her arm.
###Chapter 339

Thud!

Isabella stumbled, her arms flailing wildly as her designer handbag went flying. With a look of dismay, she landed hard on her back.

"Ouch! That hurts!"

She sat there on the ground, tears welling in her eyes from the pain, her lips trembling.

Any decent man would have helped a woman like her—especially if they were the one who caused the fall.

But Alexander barely spared her a glance. With a swift stride, he disappeared from her sight.

At that moment, Daniel also rushed over.

He glanced at Isabella, who was now in a pitiful state, then followed Alexander without hesitation.

In just a few seconds, Isabella began questioning her usually unshakable confidence in her beauty.

"Isabella? What are you doing on the ground? You look ridiculous!"

Harrison had just stepped out for a smoke and frowned at his daughter's predicament.

"Dad! You see your own daughter fall and don't even help? Instead, you mock me?"

Isabella used the coffee table to pull herself up. Her ankle was swollen, and her Maison de Valois heels were broken. Angrily, she kicked the ruined shoe away.

"I bumped into Mr. Kingsley. If it weren't for him, I wouldn’t be in this mess. But I don’t know why he was in such a hurry." She sat on the sofa, wincing from the pain.

She had hoped tonight would leave a lasting impression on Alexander. Instead, it was a disaster. Frustration brought her to the brink of tears.

Harrison noticed the urgency in Alexander’s departure, his expression darkening.

In the underground parking lot.

"Mr. Kingsley! Where are you going? What’s happening?"

Daniel, sweating profusely, followed Alexander, his voice trembling with anxiety.

"Seraphina is in trouble. I need to find her—now." Alexander’s voice was ice, his jawline sharp with tension.

The veins on his hand stood out as he yanked open the door of his sports car. His storm-dark eyes burned with barely contained fury.

"I’ll come with you! Backup is always good!"

"No. You drive too slow. Stay here and handle any fallout."

The engine roared to life. Like an arrow released, the car shot out of the parking lot.

Daniel watched the dust settle in its wake, his heart heavy with worry.

"Mrs. Kingsley has to be okay. Mr. Kingsley, bring her back safe."

The sleek Lamborghini tore through the streets of New York like lightning.

"Seraphina, I’m coming. You have to be okay. You have to be."

Alexander’s forehead was creased, his heart pounding as he pressed the accelerator to the floor.

On the passenger seat, his phone displayed a blurry, obviously sneaky photo.

In it, Seraphina was held by a stranger in a suit. Her hair cascaded like silk, her eyes smoky and seductive, lips parted in a way that made his blood boil.

Who was this man?

Was she drunk?

No. Seraphina never drank with strangers. The only times she’d been intoxicated were with her brothers.

Drugged?

The thought sent a sharp pain through his chest. His grip on the wheel turned his knuckles white.

At a hotel in the West District.

Alexander’s suit was damp with sweat. The moment he stepped into the lobby, his phone buzzed.

An anonymous call.

"Hello." His voice was low, rough with tension.

"Mr. Kingsley. Room 2051, twentieth floor."

A strange male voice spoke, cold and detached. "The key card is in the plant pot by the staircase. If you want to save Ms. Seraphina, hurry. If you’re late… well, you’ll regret it."

Alexander moved forward, then paused. "Who are you? Did you send the photo?"

The man confirmed.

"Are you a paparazzo? Or working for someone? How do you have the key?" Alexander demanded, sharp.

"Good questions. But I can’t answer them. Just know—I have my reasons."

Something felt off. But with Seraphina’s safety at stake, he didn’t have time to think.

He took the elevator to the twentieth floor. The key card was exactly where the caller said.

As he approached the door, his pulse hammered in his throat.

The entire way, his mind had raced through every possible scenario.

None of them good.

Beep.

The door unlocked.

Alexander stepped inside, his throat tight.

The room was dim, silent. The faint scent of flowers lingered in the air.

But there was no chaos. No scene he couldn’t bear to witness.

"Seraphina?"

His voice was hoarse.

No answer.

Heart pounding, he moved toward the bedroom.

Then—a rustling sound.

His blood ran cold.

"Seraphina!"

He threw the door open.

A scream pierced the darkness.

And there, standing before him—completely naked—was Victoria.

Her porcelain skin glistened under the soft light, her long hair draped over her chest. She trembled, the picture of vulnerability.

But her eyes?

They held a glint of triumph.

Alexander recoiled, turning away instantly. His fists clenched so hard his knuckles cracked.

The realization hit him like a truck.

He’d been played.

"Alexander… how did you get in here?" Victoria’s voice was soft, trembling. "Did you… see everything?"

"Get dressed." His voice was steel.

"I—I’ll call my brother. He’ll take you home."

He moved to leave.

"Alexander! Don’t go!"

Victoria lunged, pressing her naked body against his back. Her arms locked around him like a vice.

"I’ve never had a boyfriend. My body is untouched. Now that you’ve seen me… you have to take responsibility!"

"Responsibility?" Alexander’s laugh was ice. "The only woman I’m responsible for is Seraphina."

He wrenched free, sending Victoria sprawling onto the bed.

Before she could react, he was already at the door.

"Alexander! You’re really going to ignore me? Why?!"

Victoria pounded the mattress, her hair wild, her expression twisted with rage.

Alexander didn’t look back.

He yanked the door open—

And was immediately blinded by camera flashes.

A crowd of journalists blocked the exit, snapping photos furiously.

Alexander’s breath froze. His face went pale.

Now he understood.

This had been a trap from the start.

One designed to exploit his love for Seraphina.

"Alexander! Oh my God—why are there so many reporters?!"

Victoria’s shrill voice cut through the chaos.

She stood in the doorway, barely covered by a towel, playing the perfect damsel in distress.

"Is that Victoria Sterling?!"

"It is her! Front-page material, boys!"

"Alexander Kingsley and Victoria Sterling caught in a hotel room—half-naked! This is gold!"

Victoria clung to Alexander, her eyes wide with fake fear.

Alexander’s expression was stone.

"Mr. Kingsley! Are you and Miss Sterling involved?"

"Come on, admit it! Nothing to be ashamed of!"

"Miss Sterling! Care to explain?"

Alexander’s voice cut through the noise like a blade.

"Get. Out."

The reporters flinched.

But the damage was already done.
###Chapter 340

The sterile white walls of the hospital room seemed to close in around Adrian Chambers. Dressed in a thin hospital gown, he lay motionless on the bed, his usually sharp features now drained of color. His lips, pale as winter roses, parted slightly as he struggled to draw breath.

"Mr. Chambers, what were you thinking?" His secretary, Preston Walsh, stood rigid by the bedside, his voice trembling with barely contained panic. "That horse could have killed you! All your sacrifices, everything you've built in Helgen—gone in an instant!"

Adrian's eyelids fluttered open, revealing a faint, exhausted smile. "Preston," he murmured, "I didn't know you cared so much."

Preston's throat tightened. He had served Adrian for eight years—first as a stable boy, then as his most trusted aide. Titles changed, but loyalty never wavered.

Adrian was a fortress, his heart guarded by walls of ice. No one got close. No one, except Evangeline Ashbourne.

And now, for the first time, Preston saw a crack in those walls.

"Your health is everything, sir," Preston insisted, voice thick with emotion.

"For Evangeline," Adrian whispered, his gaze softening at her name, "I'd do it again. I need her to know—I can bleed for her too. Not just Thaddeus."

A bitter edge crept into his tone. "Next time she needs saving, I want her to think of me first."

Preston nodded slowly. "You mean... a man like Thaddeus, tangled in scandals, isn't worthy of her."

Adrian's jaw clenched. He didn't answer.

A vibration cut through the silence.

Adrian glanced at his phone—then swiftly tucked it under his pillow as the door swung open.

"Adrian?"

Evangeline's voice was like sunlight piercing through storm clouds. Adrian's lips curved into a warm smile, though his fingers dug into the sheets beneath him.

"Evangeline, I told you—I'm fine."

She stepped inside, her sharp gaze sweeping over his battered form. Guilt twisted in her chest.

This was her fault.

"I said I'd take responsibility," she replied, her tone softer than usual as she approached.

Adrian's heart swelled.

"Ms. Ashbourne," Preston interjected carefully, "you took a fall too. Are you hurt?"

"Scratches. Nothing compared to his broken arm, fractured ribs, and five stitches." Evangeline's voice was steady, but her fingers twitched at her sides.

Adrian chuckled weakly. "I don't need a hospital. I know my limits."

"Oh, for—" Evangeline threw up her hands. "What is it with you men? Thaddeus just had brain surgery and refused to stay put either. Is there some macho rulebook I missed?"

The moment Thaddeus's name left her lips, she froze.

Adrian's smile turned brittle. "You really do think of him often, don't you?"

Evangeline met his gaze, unflinching. "Do you want the truth?"

His breath hitched.

"Yes. He matters. More than I'd like." Her voice was calm, but the ache in her chest was anything but. "We were married for three years, but I've known him far longer. When he left, it felt like losing half my soul."

Her nails bit into her palms. "Could you forget that?"

"Evangeline—"

"I'm not pining for him," she cut in, waving a dismissive hand. "I just need time."

Adrian's face paled further. He struggled to sit up, but Evangeline shoved him back down.

"Stop! You're injured!"

"Ten years. Twenty. A lifetime." His voice was raw. "I'll wait. Until you heal. Until you see me."

His hand shot out, gripping hers with desperate strength.

"Let go!" She yanked free—and Adrian nearly toppled off the bed.

Preston lunged to catch him, shooting Evangeline a pleading look. "Ms. Ashbourne, please—he saved you."

"Preston, don't." Adrian coughed, sweat beading on his brow. "I'm asking too much."

Evangeline's lips pressed into a thin line.

Then—a chime.

Another.

And another.

All three phones buzzed in unison.

Evangeline frowned, pulling out her device. A Twitter notification glared up at her:

[THADDEUS FAIRHAVEN CAUGHT IN HOTEL SCANDAL WITH EDITH FAIRHAVEN]

Her blood turned to ice.

"Oh my God," Preston gasped, scrolling frantically. "Ms. Ashbourne, Mr. Chambers—have you seen this? Thaddeus and the Fairhaven heiress? The photos—the video—this is explosive!"

Adrian remained still, his expression unreadable.

Evangeline's fingers trembled. "I have to go."

"Evangeline!" Adrian called after her.

She paused at the door, shoulders rigid.

"No matter what," he vowed, "I won't betray you. Ever."

The bathroom door slammed behind her.

Alone, Evangeline sank onto the closed toilet seat, her phone shaking in her hands as she scrolled through the damning evidence.

Comments flooded in:

"Men like Thaddeus are trash. First Evangeline, now Edith?"

"He's just using the Ashbournes for their money!"

"Edith's a stick compared to Evangeline. What's his damage?"

Her vision blurred.

Then—her brother's call.

"Evangeline? Evangeline?" Cassius's voice was urgent.

"I saw it," she whispered.

"Are you—"

"I'm fine." Her laugh was hollow. "Edith is Jareth's sister. Good for him. The Fairhavens will boost his career."

"Evangeline," Cassius said quietly, "you knew Thaddeus for thirteen years. Does this sound like him?"

Her grip on the phone tightened. "Even if it's a setup, he walked into that room willingly."

A beat of silence.

"Flies don't bite seamless eggs," she spat.

"At least hear his side—"

"No." Her voice cracked. "We're done."

She hung up—just as another call lit up her screen.

Thaddeus Fairhaven.
###Chapter 341

The caller ID didn't display a name—just a string of numbers.

One.

Alexander Kingsley always had two numbers: one personal, one for business. Isabella Sinclair remembered them both.

He only ever used his personal phone to call her privately. This was unusual.

A knot twisted in Isabella's stomach as she answered, pressing the phone to her ear in silence.

"Isabella!" Alexander's voice was raw, barely recognizable.

She bit her lip, lashes fluttering.

"Isabella, you have to believe me. I was set up!"

Alexander knew how rare it was for her to even pick up his call. He didn’t waste time. "This is a trap—a complex one. Victoria Sterling couldn’t have orchestrated this alone. Someone else is behind her. And the bait wasn’t Victoria. It was you."

"Meet me in half an hour."

Isabella’s voice was hollow, her eyes shadowed. "The playground near The Regal Palace Hotel."

If she hadn’t gotten that call from Sebastian Lockwood earlier, Alexander wouldn’t have had this chance.

Now, she wanted to hear his explanation.

"Mr. Kingsley, Ms. Sinclair just left the hospital alone."

Harvey rushed back to report to Nathaniel Whitmore. "She was in the restroom for a while. When she came out, she looked furious—and paler."

Nathaniel leaned against the headboard, a smirk playing on his lips.

Good. Let her rage burn. The hotter, the better.

Only searing pain could cauterize Alexander from her heart completely.

"Send someone to follow her. And get a car ready. I’ll be right behind her."

Harvey hesitated but nodded. "I’ll arrange the car—and a fresh suit."

"No suit." Nathaniel winced as he shifted, sweat beading on his brow. "A patient should look the part."

Harvey sighed.

Nathaniel was invested in this game—obsessed, even.

But Harvey didn’t understand. Nathaniel, always so calculated, never let emotions rule him.

Yet here he was, unraveling over love.

But Nathaniel knew exactly what he was doing.

In love, dominance wasn’t always power. Sometimes, retreating was the deadliest strike.

Especially with a woman like Isabella.

She’d suffered enough under Alexander. Nathaniel would give her the pride she deserved.

His phone buzzed.

Harvey handed it to him. "Mr. Whitmore, it’s Ms. Moreau."

Nathaniel’s expression darkened as he answered. "Speak."

"Did my little performance work?"

Vanessa’s voice was honeyed, triumphant. "I sent those photos to Alexander, and he ran to that hotel like a desperate fool. So much for his genius reputation. Pathetic."

"You sent them via text?"

"Of course."

"Perfect." Nathaniel smirked. "You’ve done well. Thank you."

"Thank you?" Vanessa’s voice softened, dripping with devotion. "Nathaniel, my life is yours. I’d do anything for you."

His tone turned icy. "I’ll have a new ticket and funds wired to you. Enough for a year abroad. Contact Harvey if you need more."

A sharp inhale. "You’re sending me away?"

"Alexander isn’t stupid. He’ll investigate. Lay low. Harvey will handle The Velvet Haven temporarily."

"But—"

"Obey."

"...Yes, Mr. Whitmore."

Isabella arrived first.

The park was deserted, snow falling heavily, the cold biting through her coat.

She sat on a bench, staring at the empty playground.

She used to come here often, watching couples share ice cream, families laughing.

She’d wondered, back then—would she ever have that?

Would she and Alexander ever walk hand in hand, carefree, like normal lovers?

A sharp ache pierced her chest.

An ice cream truck passed. She flagged it down, buying vanilla.

Before she could take a bite, footsteps crunched through snow toward her.

"Isabella."

Her grip tightened on the cone. Slowly, she looked up.

Alexander stood before her, snow dusting his shoulders, his face flushed from cold—but his eyes were red-rimmed, raw.

For a heartbeat, the scene she’d imagined a thousand times unfolded before her.

"Isabella, don’t sit here. You’ll freeze."

His voice cracked as he reached for her.

Smack.

She slapped his hand away, colder than the storm around them. "Say what you came to say."

"It’s a setup, Isabella. Someone’s trying to destroy me—to tear us apart!"

"Us?" She laughed bitterly. "What us?"

The words gutted him.

"And even if there was an 'us,' we’re divorced. There’s nothing left to ruin."

"Is that really how you feel?" His voice was shredded steel.

She stood, meeting his gaze. "Alexander, even if it was a setup, you still met Victoria at that hotel. Seems the Fairhaven heiress means something to you."

"I didn’t go for her! I went for you!"

He stepped closer, breath ragged, eyes burning. He tried to pull her into his arms.

"Don’t touch me!"

She recoiled, flinging her ice cream at his chest.

"Isabella, I’m telling the truth!"

His hands hung in the air, desperate. "I called you all night—you never answered! I thought something happened to you!"

She froze.

Called her? When?

She checked her phone. No missed calls.

Then—

Her breath hitched.

She opened her blocked contacts list.

Alexander’s name sat there, silent.

Her blood ran cold.

The luxury car sped toward the hospital.

Isabella and Nathaniel sat in tense silence.

"Are you angry with me?"

Nathaniel studied her profile. "I was just worried."

"You didn’t do anything wrong." Her voice was flat.

He clenched his fists.

She pulled out her phone, checking her call log again.

Nothing.

But Alexander wouldn’t lie about this.

Unless—

Her fingers trembled as she opened her blocked list.

And there he was.

Her vision blurred.
###Chapter 342

"Isabella? What's wrong?" Nathaniel could tell by the look on Isabella's face that something was off, his voice laced with concern.

"I just realized—I never blocked Alexander on my phone. So how is he on my blocked list?"

As she spoke, Isabella's sharp gaze slowly shifted to Nathaniel's innocent face.

"Isabella."

"Did you do this?"

Isabella asked bluntly, "Apart from you, I haven't met anyone privately tonight. Alexander told me he tried calling me all night but couldn’t get through because he was on my blocked list."

Nathaniel's hands clenched subtly, a cold glint flashing briefly behind his polished glasses.

"I’ve been thinking, and the only time I left my phone was when I went to the restroom at the restaurant. So, you blocked him then, didn’t you?" Isabella narrowed her eyes slightly.

"Isabella, are you accusing me?" Nathaniel's eyes remained as clear and guileless as ever.

"I’m not accusing. I’m stating facts."

Sympathy clearly wasn’t on the table.

A crushing weight of loss settled over Nathaniel, making it hard for him to breathe. "Isabella, I admit, I shouldn’t have touched your phone. But I didn’t want Alexander to ruin our date, and you have no idea how much I’ve looked forward to tonight. I was selfish, and no matter how I try to explain it, it’s my fault. I’m sorry."

"This is the first and last time. It won’t happen again."

Too much had happened tonight, and Isabella simply didn’t have the energy to argue. "Whatever is between Alexander and me is our business. I don’t want anyone interfering. When we divorced, I didn’t even block him then, and I don’t want to say goodbye in such a petty way. After all, we might still have to work together in the future. As long as he’s dead to me, that’s enough. Anything more would just prove I haven’t moved on."

Nathaniel, who had been tense, brightened at her words. "Isabella, have you really let him go?"

Isabella’s eyes were deep red. She nodded slowly.

"I’m so glad, Isabella."

A surge of excitement rushed through Nathaniel, his hands moving almost on their own. "Isabella, now that you’ve let go of Alexander, could you give me a chance? I want to be the man by your side, to protect you from the storm. I may not have been part of your past, but I want to be in your future."

"Nathaniel, I’m not ready for a relationship right now. I’ve told you this before."

Isabella was exhausted, physically and emotionally, her breath faint. "I’m too tired. I don’t want to fall in love again. I’m sorry."

"With me, you won’t have to do anything. Just let me love you."

Nathaniel’s gaze was intense as he leaned closer, his breath warm against her skin. "Isabella, why don’t we try? Give me a chance to treat you right, okay?"

Isabella pressed her lips together, at a loss. "A relationship isn’t like online shopping. There’s no trial period, Nathaniel."

"You don’t have to do anything. Just let me love you!"

Nathaniel’s uninjured arm braced against the car window, his body looming over hers. His slightly upturned eyes brimmed with affection, threatening to drown her. "I’ll always be here for you. If you ever think I’m worth it, I’ll be waiting, no matter when you look back."

"Nathaniel, thank you for saving me tonight. But please, don’t risk your life like that again."

Isabella frowned, a complicated emotion swirling inside her. "I’m not worth that kind of sacrifice. It’s not too late to walk away."

Walk away?

Nathaniel’s hand, pale against the cold window, clenched slowly. A faint redness tinged the corners of his eyes.

Those words cut deeper than any rejection.

"Everyone’s love is precious. I don’t want you to end up like me."

All love, in the end, was a mistake.

When Alexander returned to his car, the night was already deep.

Gordon had bought hot coffee from a 24-hour supermarket across the park. Handing it over, he noticed Alexander’s hands were frozen stiff, unable to even hold the cup.

His heart ached. He cranked the car’s heat to maximum, draped his coat over Alexander’s shivering frame, and pressed the warm coffee into his palm.

"Mr. Kingsley, there’s a hospital nearby. We should get your hands checked. They’re cracked from the cold."

"How did they do it?" Alexander stared at his phone, his voice mechanical.

Gordon blinked. "Mr. Kingsley?"

"The photos were on my phone. No one touched it. I didn’t delete them. So how were they erased?" Alexander bit out each word through gritted teeth.

"Could it be a virus? Or a hack?"

Gordon’s mind raced. "You sent me to study cybersecurity before. Advanced hackers only need your phone number and model to access your device and delete unencrypted files. You always delete sensitive messages or store them encrypted. Could someone have hacked you?"

Alexander exhaled sharply, his forehead damp with sweat.

Right. He’d learned about hacking in military school. How had he forgotten?

Text messages couldn’t be altered—but they could be deleted.

"Investigate this."

Alexander’s face was pale as marble, his voice thunderous. "Check the hotel where Evelyn was tonight. Pull the surveillance footage. Find that woman who looks exactly like Isabella."

"Exactly like her? That’s impossible!"

Gordon was stunned, thinking his boss had lost his mind. "Mrs. Kingsley is one-of-a-kind. No one could compare, let alone look identical."

"Just do as I say."

Alexander remembered the face in the photo—so eerily similar to Isabella’s. A chill ran down his spine. That woman couldn’t be Isabella.

But if she existed, with a face nearly identical to Isabella’s, she could be used to harm her.

His urgency to find her was no longer just about uncovering a conspiracy.

"As for the deleted messages, I’ll trace the source."

The rumors of Alexander’s secret rendezvous with Evelyn continued to spread online.

Both Kingsley Enterprises and Fairhaven Group dispatched PR teams, but the scandal had gone viral. Despite efforts to suppress it, the photos and videos kept circulating.

When Mrs. Fairhaven saw the trending topic, she gasped, dropping her phone and tumbling down the stairs. Thankfully, the fall was short, but she still twisted her ankle and hit her head.

Sebastian panicked, rushing her to the hospital.

In the hospital room, Mrs. Fairhaven lay in bed with an IV, clutching Sebastian’s hand, tears welling in her eyes.

"Sebastian, what do we do? Evelyn is only twenty-two. How will she face the world after this? How will I face your grandfather and father?" She burst into sobs.

"I’ll handle it, Mom," Sebastian said hoarsely.

"But how? There’s photo evidence! Evelyn isn’t even married yet. Who will want her now?"

"Evelyn is my sister. Anyone who dares gossip will regret it." Sebastian’s eyes burned with fury.

"Innocent words can destroy reputations. Do you think this is the old days when the Fairhavens could silence anyone? We live under the law now. Can you control this?"

Mrs. Fairhaven pounded the bed in frustration.

The Fairhavens had underworld roots. His grandfather, Reginald Fairhaven, had fought ruthlessly to build their empire. Over time, he’d legitimized the business, but traces of their past remained. His father had clashed with Reginald over their methods.

Sebastian always thought his father was too soft.

If he were in charge, the Fairhaven Group would’ve been unstoppable, and his scheming uncle wouldn’t dare challenge them.

"And what about your so-called best friend? He hasn’t said a word since this happened. Does he think he can just ignore it?" Mrs. Fairhaven cried harder.

"Mom, don’t talk about Alexander like that. He’s not that kind of man!"

"The evidence is everywhere. How can he deny it?"

"There’s an explanation. Alexander has never shown interest in Evelyn. He loves someone else! He would never touch her!" Sebastian’s voice cracked.

"Evelyn is your sister! She’s been violated, and you’re still defending him?"

"Mom!"

"There’s only one solution. Alexander has to take responsibility for Evelyn!"

Sebastian’s expression darkened. "Responsibility? What do you mean?"

"I’ll discharge myself soon, pick a date, and go to the Kingsleys to propose marriage!"

"You’re out of your mind! Even at gunpoint, Alexander won’t marry Evelyn!" Sebastian shot up from his seat, furious.

"That’s not his decision."

Mrs. Fairhaven’s eyes turned icy, a stark contrast to her usual gentleness. "If he’s a man, he’ll take responsibility. If he refuses, he’ll be opposing the entire Fairhaven Group. Even if I do nothing, do you think your grandfather will let his granddaughter be humiliated? Don’t think being Frederic Kingsley’s son makes him untouchable!"
###Chapter 343

Meanwhile, at the Sinclair Estate.

Just like Alexander, Mr. Vanderbilt didn't live with his sons but maintained his own sprawling estate. Though slightly smaller than the Kingsley's Windsor Estates, it remained one of the country's top ten properties.

By now, every member of the Sinclair household, from the highest-ranking to the lowest servant, knew about the scandal. Even the maids whispered about Isabella's disgrace during their breaks.

With Nathaniel and the Kingsley family maintaining radio silence, Isabella appeared as nothing more than a discarded plaything. The Sinclair name had been dragged through the mud without mercy.

"Has Ms. Isabella arrived yet?" The maids huddled together, voices hushed.

"She's here, sobbing in Mr. Sebastian's study. Poor thing! She's really going through it!"

"What good will crying do? As the Sinclair heiress, how could she be so reckless? A woman's reputation is everything. Being caught in such a compromising position with the Kingsley CEO—who'd want her now?"

"Maybe Nathaniel would. They were seen together at that hotel—something must've happened. Now that it's public, he has to take responsibility!"

"Please. He's clearly avoiding it. The man's dodging accountability like a pro."

"Aren't Mr. Sebastian and Nathaniel close friends? This is beyond awkward."

"Shh! Quiet—here comes Mr. Dominic!"

The servants scattered, dipping into quick curtsies. "Good afternoon, Mr. Dominic!"

The man ascending the stairs, his dark hair impeccably styled and navy suit pristine, was none other than Barry Vanderbilt's second son—Sebastian's uncle, Dominic Vanderbilt.

With a chilling smile, Dominic passed them, tossing a warning over his shoulder. "Keep gossiping, and it won't be me you answer to. My nephew isn't as forgiving."

The maids paled, trembling.

"Grandpa, you have to help me! I can't show my face anywhere now!"

Isabella collapsed into Barry's arms, her sobs uncontrollable, eyes swollen to the size of marbles.

"My dear, stop crying! You'll ruin those pretty eyes!" Barry patted her shaking back, his own eyes misting. "Don't worry. If your mother and brother won't handle this, I will!"

"Father's absolutely right." Dominic strolled in, feigning concern. "Isabella is our family's pride. Now that Nathaniel's disrespected her, we can't let this slide."

"Uncle Dominic!" Isabella wailed louder.

Barry frowned. "Dominic, you know about this?"

"Rumors spread like wildfire in Elmsworth. Especially juicy ones." Dominic lounged on the sofa, plucking an orange from the fruit bowl. "My suggestion? Force Nathaniel to marry her."

Barry's bushy white eyebrows shot up.

Isabella hid her smirk in her grandfather's sleeve.

"Despite being illegitimate, Nathaniel will inherit Kingsley Group. Marrying him would make Isabella a Kingsley matriarch. Not a bad deal." Dominic popped an orange slice into his mouth.

"Uncle Dominic!" Isabella flushed crimson.

"I've thought it through. We'll tell the press they've been dating privately to avoid media frenzy. Young couples deserve privacy. The public overreacted—look how they've traumatized our Isabella."

Dominic owned several PR firms. Spin doctoring was his specialty.

"Your talent for rewriting narratives is truly impressive. A masterclass in deception."

A mocking voice cut through the room as Sebastian strode in, his towering frame radiating menace.

"Sebastian." Isabella shrank deeper into Barry's embrace.

Dominic's smile faltered, the orange in his hand crushed. "Sebastian, in a foul mood? Taking it out on your dear uncle?"

"Mind your tone with elders," Barry snapped.

Sebastian's lips curled into a frosty smile, his handsome face glacial. He sat opposite Dominic, radiating dangerous charm. "Since becoming CEO, you've meddled in every Sinclair affair. No children of your own, so you're living vicariously through Isabella's marriage plans? How pathetic."

Dominic's throat tightened as fury surged.

Childlessness was his greatest shame.

Publicly, he blamed his wife. Only she knew the truth—he was impotent.

But he couldn't lose his temper here. Gritting his teeth, his eyes burned crimson.

"Sebastian! How dare you speak to your uncle like that?" Barry slammed the armrest.

"Just joking, Grandpa." Sebastian flashed a cheeky grin at Dominic. "Uncle loves me too much to stay mad, right?"

The audacity was infuriating.

Dominic maintained his smile while mentally shooting his nephew a thousand times.

"As for Isabella's marriage, don't bother. I'll find her a worthy match—but it won't be Nathaniel." Sebastian punctuated each word, dropping the room's temperature.

Isabella's face fell from smug to shattered.

"Sebastian, explain yourself. If not Nathaniel, then who?" Dominic adopted a stern tone. "After this scandal, if Kingsley Group rejects her, it's a direct insult to Sinclairs. Does Nathaniel think our family is beneath him?"

Before he finished, Isabella burst into fresh tears. "Grandpa, Uncle Dominic—I'd rather die than face this humiliation!"

"Calm down, my dear! I'll get justice!" Barry, a man of influence, wouldn't tolerate this. Enraged, he shattered his teacup. "Nathaniel thinks he can play with her and walk away? He's crossed a line! Sebastian, is it true your mother was hospitalized over this?"

Sebastian swallowed hard, silent.

"Once she's discharged, you'll propose to the Kingsleys. If you refuse, I'll go myself!"

"Grandpa, be reasonable!"

"Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't you and Nathaniel like brothers?" Dominic crossed his legs, enjoying the show. "This would unite our families. Why oppose it?"

"Exactly because we're close that I know his character." Sebastian's voice turned icy. "Nathaniel's in love with Evadne Ashbourne!"

The name "Evadne" froze all three Sinclairs.

Even Barry's gaze flickered with unease.

"Isabella, you've thrown yourself at Nathaniel repeatedly. Did it work? Has he ever glanced your way? You had to scheme just to get a moment with him. So how could he possibly have been with you at that hotel? Face reality!"

Sebastian's voice rose, a vein throbbing at his temple.

He tolerated Isabella's tantrums—but not her manipulations.

"Grandpa, hear how he talks about me?" Isabella played the victim flawlessly. "I'm his sister, yet he makes me sound like some cheap seductress! Yes, I love Nathaniel—but it takes two. If he didn't want me, why go to that hotel?"

Her suggestive pause spoke volumes.

"Even if Nathaniel loves Evadne, that's over now." Barry stroked Isabella's hair, jaw clenched. "My granddaughter gets what she wants. End of discussion."

Isabella peeked up, tears masking her triumph.

"Grandpa!" Sebastian's fists trembled.

"What a joyous occasion—Sinclairs and Kingsleys united." Dominic stood, bowing mockingly. "Congratulations in advance, Isabella. I'll gift you something exquisite."

Dominic exited Barry's mansion, his expression stormy.

His secretary followed, confused. "Sir, why support this match? Nathaniel would never agree."

"You think I don't know that?" Dominic smirked. "Nathaniel nearly died for Evadne recently. Anyone with eyes sees their bond. Isabella's delusional. That's exactly why I'm stirring the pot—the more chaos, the better for us."

"Brilliant!"

A sinister glint flashed in Dominic's eyes. "Nothing destroys friendships like a woman. Brothers? What a joke."

As he descended the stairs, a thought struck him. "That girl Sebastian's keeping—what's her name?"

"Sophia!"

"Watch her closely. She might be useful."

"Sebastian! You're hurting me! Let go!"

Sebastian dragged Isabella into an empty room, his grip brutal.

He slammed the door and flung her to the floor.

Isabella cried out, her arm already bruising.

"Tell me what really happened at that hotel!" Sebastian barely restrained his rage.

"I don't know what you're talking about!" She clutched her arm, defiant.

"You're not smart enough to orchestrate this alone. Who helped you?"

Sebastian loomed over her, eyes blazing. "Who's pulling your strings?"

Isabella's heart pounded, sweat beading her brow.

How could she tell him? She didn't even know.

Gritting her teeth, she spat, "It was all me!"

"Still lying?" Sebastian's voice turned deadly.

"What'll you do? Hit me? Kill me?" Isabella laughed bitterly. "Go ahead!"
###Chapter 344

The woman standing before him, laughing manically with a wicked smile, was pushing Jareth to his breaking point. Every word she spoke, every gesture she made, was a slap to his face. It was impossible for him to reconcile this cruel, twisted version with the sweet sister he had once adored.

When had she become like this? When had his beloved Edith, the girl he had cherished and shielded, turned into this uncontrollable, venomous creature?

"Answer me, Edith. Who's manipulating you?" Jareth demanded, his voice raw with fury and desperation.

"No one controls me, Jareth. No matter how many times you ask, my answer won't change," Edith retorted, rising gracefully from her seat. She smoothed the fabric of her designer dress, then flicked her long, wavy brunette hair over her shoulder with deliberate provocation.

"Jareth, I'm about to marry your best friend and become the First Lady of the Abernathy Group. You know Thaddeus. Despite your pathetic attempts to set me up with some wealthy stranger, I've always loved him. I'd never settle for anyone else. Aren't you happy for me? You used to dote on me. Was that all just an act?"

"Edith, what the hell are you saying?" Each word she spoke was like a knife twisting in his chest.

"Oh, right. You've found a replacement for me. I suppose I'm not as important as Evadne now, am I?" Edith laughed hysterically, tears streaming down her face.

"Mark my words—Thaddeus will never marry you. Don't delude yourself!" Jareth gritted his teeth. "And Evadne was never your enemy. She isn't."

"My future sister-in-law? That dimwit?" Edith sneered. "Even if I accepted her, Mother and Grandfather would never allow a Fairhaven to marry into the Abernathy family. Face reality, Jareth. No matter how much you love her, she'll always be your dirty little secret. I bet Mr. Frederic would rather die than let his precious daughter marry you."

Jareth's breath hitched, his heart clenching painfully. "My marriage is none of your concern. Stay out of it!"

"Then my marriage is none of yours either."

Edith, done wasting time on him, strode toward the door, rubbing her bruised arm.

"Edith, you're returning to Aetheria tonight. Without my permission, you are not setting foot in Elmsworth again!" Jareth's eyes burned with fury and betrayal.

"Jareth, do you really think you can still control me?" Edith leaned against the doorframe, chin lifted in defiance. "Grandfather wants me to stay with him until the wedding. Once I'm Thaddeus' wife, do you honestly believe you'll have any say over me? Think again."

"Edith."

Jareth inhaled sharply, his handsome face pale with rage. "If you walk out that door today, from this moment on—I am no longer your brother."

Edith's gaze was icy, devoid of emotion, as if he were nothing more than a stranger.

"If my own brother won't support me, then I don't need him."

Rumors spread like wildfire in Elmsworth, and the scandals of the elite were far more tantalizing than any tabloid gossip. After all, nothing thrilled the masses more than watching the mighty fall.

Meanwhile, Evadne had no time for idle chatter. She had more pressing matters to attend to.

"Evadne, you're incredible!" Aaron and his sister sat across from her in the corner of the hotel café.

Aaron slid several photos toward her. "Just as you predicted, that criminal had a hidden room filled with pictures of Elspeth. He wasn't Myra's obsessed admirer—he was fixated on her."

Evadne pressed her lips together, lowering her voice. "Aaron, did you find anything else?"

Aaron hesitated before producing a sealed evidence bag. Inside was a tarnished diamond earring, its design outdated and its quality mediocre.

Evadne's memory was sharp. She flipped through the photos until she found the match.

"This earring belongs to Elspeth. There are photos of her wearing it. It's identical."

Aaron, a seasoned detective, was impressed. "Evadne, you're wasted outside law enforcement."

She smirked. "I lack patience. I'd probably execute criminals on the spot."

Aaron had no response.

"It seems Elspeth and this man had a close relationship. She even gave him her favorite earring. Do you think there was something between them?" Evadne's eyes narrowed.

"Even if there was, it's irrelevant now. This only proves they knew each other—not that Elspeth conspired with him to attack Myra," Aaron said seriously.

"I know. But this evidence is enough to put Elspeth under scrutiny."

Evadne held the earring up to the light, her gaze icy with determination. "Aaron, your men interrogated him. He won't talk. If he's truly loyal to Elspeth, there won't be any suspicious transactions linking them. We can't pin the attempted murder on her. So now, I need to use what we do have to gather more evidence—and deliver the final blow."

Aaron's eyes widened. "Evadne, what are you planning?"

She leaned back, fingertips drumming against the table, exuding an aura of lethal elegance.

"I'm paying a visit to the Abernathy family. It's time for a little chat with Elspeth."

After parting ways with Aaron, Evadne received a call from Debby. Her sister would be returning to Helgen early the next morning. Rushing back to Silveke Harbor, Evadne found Debby and Suri in the living room, tearfully exchanging farewells.

"Mom, you're being dramatic," Debby said lightly, though her eyes were red-rimmed. "Helgen isn't far. You can visit anytime."

"You say that, but last time I barely saw you. You were too busy with your husband," Suri sniffed, clutching her daughter's hand.

Debby sighed. "I'm sorry, Mom. D’arcy had last-minute obligations, and as his wife, I had to accompany him."

"Debby!" Evadne hurried in, reluctance heavy in her voice. "Can't you stay longer? We haven't had proper time together!"

"There's always next time, Evadne." Debby stood, embracing her sister tightly. "After the election, I'll bring D’arcy back for a longer visit. We'll make up for lost time."

"Hmph. I'll hold you to that, Future First Lady of Helgen."

"Miss Evadne!" Jason appeared, his suit dusted with flour.

"Jason, have you been cooking?" Evadne raised a brow.

"Myra and Ms. Nydia are in the kitchen. I thought I'd help." He looked both embarrassed and concerned.

"What? Myra's cooking?" Suri stood abruptly. "Why didn't you stop her? She fainted this morning!"

Evadne's stomach dropped. "Myra fainted? I need to see her!"

In the kitchen, Nydia hovered anxiously as Myra chopped vegetables with unsettling speed.

"Mom, are you okay?" Nydia fretted.

"I'm fine. We can't keep everyone waiting for dinner."

A sharp gasp.

"Mom! You're bleeding!" Nydia's voice trembled.

"Myra!"

Evadne and Jason arrived just as blood dripped from Myra's finger.

"Jason, get the first aid kit from my room. This needs stitches!" Evadne ordered.

Within moments, Jason returned, and Evadne expertly stitched the wound. Nydia watched in awe—her sister was capable of anything.

"Ms. Nydia, don't worry. Miss Evadne has it handled," Jason murmured, resting a comforting hand on her shoulder.

Nydia, sensing Evadne needed privacy, discreetly wiped her tears and followed Jason out.

"Myra, rest assured. The injustice you've suffered won't go unanswered." Evadne's voice was low as she bandaged the wound.

"I appreciate your kindness, but please don't act on my behalf. I'm fine!" Myra's eyes were dazed.

"Twenty years ago, someone harmed you without consequence. If she dares try again now, she's only hastening her own downfall." Evadne's tone turned icy. "If she's courting death, I'll grant her wish sooner than she expects."

Myra snapped to attention, gripping Evadne's wrist. "Evadne, do you know who did this?"

"I do. And I think you've guessed too."

Pain flickered in Evadne's eyes. "You should tell Emeric. When his woman is hurt, how can he stand idle?"

"Evadne, I don't want revenge. I just want peace for our family." Tears rolled down Myra's cheeks like fallen stars.

Evadne exhaled sharply. They both knew Emeric's temper. If he learned Elspeth was involved, he might resort to extreme measures.

Evadne preferred a more refined approach. To deal with a viper like Elspeth, she'd play a far more cunning game.

"Myra, do you recognize this man?"

Evadne showed her a photo of the attacker.

Myra's eyes widened. "That's Dunn. He used to work at the TV station, running errands for the actors."

"So he had unrestricted access to the building back then?"

"Yes. He even filled in as an extra sometimes." Myra frowned. "Evadne, why are you asking about him?"

Evadne's brow furrowed, a chilling realization dawning.

Leaving Myra's room, Evadne's expression was grim.

"Miss Evadne." A servant approached. "A gentleman has been waiting for you outside. He's been there quite some time."

Her pulse spiked. Unbidden, an image of Thaddeus standing in the snow, waiting silently for her, flashed through her mind.

"You didn't tell anyone, did you?" Her voice was hushed.

"No. He asked me to inform you discreetly."

"Understood."

Steadying her breathing, Evadne crossed the courtyard, her heart pounding as she neared the antique door.

Despite their recent fight, she felt no lingering resentment—only an erratic, uncontrollable anticipation.

She didn't understand her own heart anymore.

The door creaked open.

"Evadne."

The voice was warm, affectionate—but it wasn't his.

Her hopeful heart plummeted.

The man before her, holding the reins of a majestic horse, his smile bright as morning sunlight, was Avery.

Not him.

Not Thaddeus.

"How did you get here?"
###Chapter 345

Isabella Sinclair choked back her shock, biting down the "What are you doing here?" that threatened to spill from her lips.

Nathaniel Prescott stood before her, impeccably dressed in a tailored suit, leading a magnificent stallion that glowed like starlight against the night sky. He looked every inch the aristocratic prince from a gothic romance novel.

"Just wanted to check on you."

"How's your injury? The doctor said you needed eight weeks of recovery. And the cast on your arm?" Isabella couldn't help the concern creeping into her voice as she remembered the terrifying accident.

"With you worrying about me, no injury could possibly hurt." Nathaniel's gaze softened as it lingered on her face.

Isabella found herself speechless.

"I didn't just come to see you. I brought this." He gestured to the stallion. "You left in such a hurry last time, you couldn't take him with you."

"Nathaniel, he's stunning. But this is too much. I can't accept." Isabella shook her head firmly.

"Did I do something wrong? Are you still upset about what happened?" Nathaniel's voice dropped to a whisper.

"No, I'm past that. My relationship with Alexander Kingsley is effectively over, blocked or not." She forced a light laugh.

Nathaniel tightened his grip on the reins. "I chose this stallion specifically for you. Had him shipped from Argentina and stabled him secretly at Prescott Holdings' facilities. But after what happened with my brother taking over the stables..." He exhaled sharply. "I've got nowhere to keep him. Would you mind looking after him? Just temporarily."

Isabella hesitated, caught between principle and temptation.

"Fine, but only until you find proper accommodations." Her eyes sparkled as they traced the stallion's powerful lines. "And I mean it - the moment you have space, you're taking him back."

"Of course." Nathaniel's lips quirked upward as snowflakes began dusting his shoulders. "It's freezing out here at Silvermoon Estate. Any chance I could come in for some coffee?"

Flushing at her lack of hospitality, Isabella quickly ushered him inside.

Nathaniel followed with a satisfied smile, casting one last glance over his shoulder at the shadowed figure watching from across the street. "Pathetic," he muttered under his breath.

Meanwhile, Alexander Kingsley stood motionless by his penthouse window, cigarette dangling from his fingers.

The crystal ashtray overflowed with crushed butts, the room thick with smoke that mirrored the storm in his chest.

Regret clawed at Alexander's throat. Pride and anger had blinded him, and only after Isabella walked away did he realize the depth of his mistake.

His phone vibrated violently. Daniel Carter's name flashed on the screen.

"Mr. Kingsley, I've been watching Ms. Sinclair's residence as instructed. She's just appeared," Daniel reported, voice carefully neutral.

"And?" Alexander's knuckles whitened around the phone.

When the photos arrived, Alexander's stomach dropped. The angle made it look like Nathaniel was whispering intimately into Isabella's ear.

White-hot rage licked through Alexander's veins. His love for Isabella didn't erase his pride or self-respect.

The crimson in his hazel eyes deepened dangerously.

CRASH!

His fist shattered the windowpane, the explosion of glass nearly giving Daniel a heart attack through the phone.

"Sir, if you can't take this, go see her yourself! Nathaniel's at her house right now. Letting this slide is admitting defeat!"

"See her? Why the hell should I?" Alexander's entire body trembled with barely contained fury, his breath coming in ragged bursts. His eyes glistened with the wounded look of a stray dog left out in a thunderstorm.

"She made it clear she never wants to see me again. Fine. I'll grant her that wish."

There's only so much torment a man can take, Isabella.
###Chapter 346

The Fairhaven mansion stood eerily quiet tonight. With Emeric and Cassius overseas for business negotiations, the household was dominated by feminine energy.

Avery wasn't exactly a stranger here, but given the late hour and Myra's recent identity crisis, she didn't want to cause a scene. Evadne guided him to the parlor instead.

Neither expected to find Debby there, nursing a cup of espresso alone.

"Debby, you're still awake." Evadne blinked in surprise before gesturing to her companion. "This is my friend."

"Mr. Chambers. We met at Myra's birthday gala." Debby set down her cup with practiced grace, offering a polite smile. "Evadne's never brought a male friend home before. You're the first."

"The honor is entirely mine." Avery's deep voice carried quiet amusement as he adjusted his glasses. "And meeting Helgen's future First Lady privately? That's a privilege few can claim."

Evadne stiffened. She hadn't anticipated this turn in conversation.

Debby's expression remained unreadable. "I'm simply Evadne's sister. My husband is merely one voice in Helgen's parliament. Your flattery is unnecessary."

Avery's lips curved slightly, neither confirming nor denying.

"Enjoy your visit." Debby rose gracefully. "I'll leave you two alone."

Though Evadne maintained her smile, tension prickled between them—something unspoken, something dangerous.

Once the door clicked shut, Debby's composed mask shattered. She whipped out her phone, fingers flying across the screen.

"Did you find what I asked for?"

"Yes, ma'am. Avery Chambers' full dossier just hit your secure inbox."

"Good."

Avery didn't linger long—it was late, after all.

Back in the car, Harvey couldn't contain his excitement. "Sir! Ms. Evadne invited you inside! That's progress!"

Avery loosened his tie with a single practiced tug. "Drive."

The truth stung—she hadn't welcomed him willingly. As always, he was the one chasing, the one sacrificing. Evadne remained just out of reach.

"With Thaddeus out of the picture, you're clearly the frontrunner!" Harvey babbled. "No man in Elmsworth compares—"

"Are you implying I'm inferior to Thaddeus?" Avery's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper.

Harvey paled. "N-never, sir! Forgive me!"

"Evadne may have moved on," Avery mused, watching streetlights blur past the window, "but Thaddeus hasn't. Stay vigilant."

"About the investigation, sir..." Harvey produced a sealed evidence bag containing a syringe. "The racetrack attack? We found traces of neural stimulants in the horses' bloodwork. Surveillance confirms Byron's men planted it."

Avery's chuckle held no warmth. "Byron lacks his brother's finesse. Sloppy work for such a small mind."

"We can't let this stand!" Harvey hissed.

"Of course not." Avery leaned back, eyes closing. "An eye for an eye seems appropriate, don't you think?"

"More than appropriate! You're showing mercy by not eliminating him outright!"

"Mercy?" Avery's lips twisted. "If Evadne had been harmed that day, do you think Byron would still be breathing?"

Later, freshly showered and wrapped in silk pajamas, Evadne finally relaxed—until Debby knocked.

"Come in!"

Debby entered like moonlight incarnate, her blue nightgown shimmering. "Still awake?"

"Obviously." Evadne patted her moisturizer-laden cheeks. "Wow, if Helgen's First Lady looks this radiant at midnight, no wonder their approval ratings are soaring."

"That golden horse outside—it's blindingly ostentatious." Debby perched on the edge of the bed. "Avery's?"

"His. He offered it to me. I declined."

"You adore horses, yet resisted a purebred? Impressive self-control." Debby nodded approvingly. "That eases my mind."

Evadne's ears perked up. "Eases your mind? Why?"

"His feelings for you are painfully obvious. The way he looks at you... it's practically tangible."

Evadne groaned. "He already confessed. God, is there a manual called 'How To Be Less Attractive'? At this rate, I'll join a convent."

"Because Thaddeus broke your heart?" Debby teased.

"Broke? More like gnawed on it like a rabid dog!" Evadne winced as she accidentally slapped her own face.

"Aviana's riding that horse right now, by the way."

"What? I haven't even—!" Evadne shot upright.

"Relax. You gift million-dollar jewels like candy, but begrudge your sister a joyride?"

Aviana's distant laughter floated through the window. Evadne sighed. "Fine. Whatever makes her happy."

Debby hesitated, fingers twisting in her lap. "Evadne... about Avery..."

"You investigated him." It wasn't a question.

"Elementary school friends who vanish for fifteen years are essentially strangers," Debby said carefully. "He's... complicated in Helgen. His business ties intersect with organized crime. My husband's first act as president was cracking down on that very corruption."

Evadne's stomach dropped. "Sounds like you two have your work cut out."

"Focus." Debby's gaze turned razor-sharp. "Avery was investigated—and acquitted—on drug trafficking charges. The prosecutor? Your brother-in-law's most incorruptible student."

"No smoke without fire," Evadne whispered.

"Exactly. Be friendly, but keep him at arm's length."

Evadne exhaled slowly. "I'm not that naive girl anymore, Debby. I've seen war. I'll be careful."

Five days later, a convoy of black SUVs rolled up to Windermere Estate.

Edith and her mother emerged first, followed by Barry Fairhaven—resplendent in his frock coat, leaning heavily on his gold-tipped cane.

"Last time you came begging, that Abernathy brat couldn't even be bothered to show his face?" Barry's voice dripped venom.

Mrs. Fairhaven flinched. "Yes, Father."

"Pathetic." Barry's cane struck marble. "The Fairhavens bow to no one! That arrogant whelp will marry Edith, or I'll make Abernathy Group regret crossing us!"

Meanwhile, inside a VIP lounge at Club Noir, Glynnis Abernathy was living up to her wild-child reputation. Half-naked male models surrounded her as she poured champagne down her décolletage, shrieking with laughter.

"Miss Glynnis!" Her assistant pushed through the throng. "The Fairhavens are at Windermere—Barry himself!"

Glynnis froze mid-giggle. "Old Man Fairhaven? Now this I've got to see!" She sprang up, eyes gleaming. "Get my car!"
###Chapter 347

The grand Abernathy residence was eerily quiet.

Nathaniel sat rigidly on the velvet sofa, his fingers scrolling through the latest headlines with increasing tension.

Despite deploying the nation's top crisis management team, the scandal involving Alexander and Seraphina showed no signs of fading. The internet was a wildfire of speculation, and Alexander's silence only deepened the shadows cast over the Abernathy name.

Across the room, Victoria lounged at her gilded vanity, meticulously brushing her waist-length hair—a vanity project costing over a million annually.

Back in the day, this very hair had ensnared Nathaniel, becoming his obsession during their most intimate moments.

"Nathaniel," she purred, twisting in her seat to crook a finger at him.

"What?" He didn’t glance up from his phone.

"Come here. Touch it. I’ve spent thirty years maintaining this for you." Her voice dripped honey, eyes gleaming with practiced allure. "Tell me it still feels the same."

"Victoria."

A question burned in Nathaniel’s throat—Did you have a hand in Evangeline’s downfall?—but he swallowed it.

Instead, he deflected. "At the hospital, when Alexander was admitted, Julian confessed his feelings for Arabella."

Victoria shot up, her face alight with triumph. "When did this happen?"

"During Alexander’s hospitalization. Julian brought Arabella to visit."

"Perfect!" She clapped her hands, giddy. "And your father’s reaction? Julian’s practically his second son! This match is ideal—he approved, didn’t he?"

"You were so adamant about pairing Genevieve with Julian before," Nathaniel remarked coolly. "Why the sudden enthusiasm for Arabella?"

Victoria sidestepped smoothly. "Darling, don’t make me sound heartless. Arabella is my daughter too. If Julian loves her, why shouldn’t I celebrate?"

"Celebrate all you want," Nathaniel muttered. "But until it’s official, things can still change."

"You don’t want her marrying into the Lockwoods?" Victoria’s voice sharpened.

"Did you see Eleanor Lockwood’s face when she left last time? Furious. Julian is her only son—do you really think she’ll accept this?"

Victoria fell silent.

She remembered Eleanor’s blazing eyes, the unspoken venom. But no—this wasn’t over.

If Julian was willing, she’d move heaven and earth to secure this match.

With a sigh, she glided to Nathaniel, kneading his shoulders. "You’ve been tense lately. Let me fix this."

"How?"

"Let Alexander marry Seraphina. Everyone wins. If we accept Seraphina, Eleanor will accept Arabella."

"Alexander only loves Evangeline. You know that."

Victoria laughed coldly. "Love means nothing if it’s unrequited. After the divorce and now this scandal? Evangeline would rather die than take him back."

She’d rather die.

Before Nathaniel could respond, urgent knocking interrupted.

"Sir, the Lockwoods are here."

"Tell them I’m not home."

"Sir... Mr. Reginald Lockwood is with them."

Nathaniel’s stomach dropped.

Victoria smirked. "See? Until Alexander marries Seraphina, this won’t end. Even Reginald is involved now."

Reginald Lockwood sat like a king on the Abernathys’ sofa, his presence suffocating the room.

"Mr. Lockwood," Nathaniel greeted stiffly. "Had we known you were coming—"

"I’m here because your family disrespects mine," Reginald cut in, icy. "My granddaughter visits, and your son can’t even be bothered to see her?"

Seraphina, nestled against Eleanor, wept silently into a handkerchief.

Victoria interjected sweetly, "Alexander wasn’t avoiding you—"

"I asked him," Reginald snapped, not sparing her a glance.

Victoria flushed crimson.

Eleanor hid a smirk. This social-climbing actress thought she could speak to Reginald Lockwood?

"Last time, you claimed Alexander wasn’t home," Reginald continued. "Today, I won’t leave without seeing him." He pulled Seraphina forward. "Will he hide forever after what he’s done?"

Hide?

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened.

Then—

"I believe Seraphina knows exactly why I’ve stayed silent."

A voice, cold and controlled, sliced through the tension.

All eyes turned.

Alexander descended the staircase, his tailored suit accentuating his imposing frame.

Seraphina’s breath hitched.

This man was every woman’s fantasy.

She would have him.

"Are you implying my granddaughter is at fault?" Reginald demanded.

Alexander smirked. "If you understood, why ask and humiliate her further?"

Silence.

Seraphina paled.

Reginald’s face purpled with rage.

"Alexander!" Nathaniel hissed.

"Rude?" Alexander’s gaze locked onto Seraphina. "Then let’s settle this. Swear to me, Seraphina."

Her pulse spiked.

"Swear you were innocent that night. That you knew nothing."

Her lips trembled. "Thad—why would you say that? You invited me to the hotel!"

His eyes narrowed.

"We agreed on Room 2051. I showered while waiting. You arrived right after. That’s what happened!" Tears spilled. "I’ll swear—if that’s what you want!"

She raised three fingers. "I swear everything I said is true. If I lie, may I be struck dead the moment I step outside!"

A hollow oath.

She believed in no divine justice—only getting what she wanted, by any means necessary.
###Chapter 348

The moment was utterly absurd to Nathaniel.

He'd believed that despite Arabella's flaws, she still held some remnant of childhood innocence. After all, she was the only sister of his closest friend.

But he'd been wrong.

She shared nothing with Sebastian but blood.

She was spoiled rotten—perhaps always had been. He'd only seen her through rose-tinted glasses because of Sebastian.

Well, if that was the case, he no longer needed to hold back for his friend's sake.

"What nonsense are you spouting? Getting hit by a car? If something happened to you, how would your mother survive?" Mrs. Vanderbilt clutched her chest, tears welling in her eyes.

"Arabella is my only granddaughter, the jewel of my heart! We've given her everything the Vanderbilt name can offer. She's never known hardship! She'd even curse herself just to prove her innocence to you—that alone should tell you she's speaking the truth!"

Dominic stroked Arabella's hair, glaring at Nathaniel. "Arabella may be pampered, but she's never lied! Is the heir of the Kingsley Group so spineless that he won't take responsibility for his actions?"

Nathaniel's eyes darkened, his fists clenching as he suppressed his fury.

"Mr. Dominic, your words are crossing a line."

Frederic couldn't tolerate his son being insulted so brazenly in front of everyone. "Stick to the matter at hand. If you have a grievance, state it plainly."

"Our families are among the most respected in New York. Your presence here tonight has already caused enough chaos. Do you truly wish to start a feud with the Kingsley Group?"

Arabella's eyes gleamed with malice.

She'd brought her grandfather here for one purpose—to force Nathaniel into marrying her.

She wouldn't let this opportunity slip away.

"Mr. Frederic, I have two demands."

Dominic's expression hardened. "First, I want your son to apologize to Arabella immediately. Because of him, my granddaughter was hounded by the press, nearly ruining her reputation!"

"Originally, I wanted the Kingsley Group to hold a press conference, but you're right—we're both public figures. A private apology will suffice. Your son admits his mistake to Arabella, and I'll consider the matter closed."

The Kingsley staff watching from the sidelines seethed with anger.

Their young master, a man of such stature, being bullied by this old man?

They wanted to unleash the hounds on him.

"Mr. Dominic! What has Mr. Nathaniel done wrong? Why should he apologize to Ms. Arabella? Isn't this blatant bullying?"

All eyes turned as Olivia stormed forward, standing defiantly in Nathaniel's defense.

Eleanor hid behind Frederic, first startled—then smirking.

She'd long despised Olivia, who'd grown bold under Nathaniel's protection, daring to disregard her authority as the lady of the house.

Now that she was sticking her neck out for this bastard, she'd get what she deserved.

"Olivia, step back," Nathaniel warned in a low voice.

"Mr. Nathaniel, I can't stand by and watch them bully you!" Olivia's eyes brimmed with tears.

She'd been watching from upstairs, her anger boiling over when Dominic demanded an apology.

"Mr. Frederic, Eleanor, has your household staff grown so bold they dare interrupt guests? How disrespectful!" Mrs. Vanderbilt sneered.

"Mrs. Vanderbilt, you may not be aware. Olivia, though a maid, holds a special position in our home."

Eleanor couldn't resist twisting the knife. "She answers to no one—not even us, the masters."

"You know exactly why Olivia holds such a position, Eleanor."

Nathaniel moved to shield Olivia, his gaze icy as it pinned Eleanor in place. "After my mother passed, Olivia cared for me as if I were her own. She is family. In my heart, her place is no less than my mother's."

"Mr. Nathaniel..." Olivia's voice trembled with emotion.

"And as I've said before, in this house, Olivia serves only me. She is not your maid. Why should she care about you, Eleanor?"

A ripple of laughter spread through the room.

In the Kingsley household, Olivia was far more respected than Eleanor and her daughter.

Eleanor gritted her teeth, but she couldn't retort without making a scene.

"Beyond the apology, there's a second demand."

Dominic, uninterested in the women's squabbles, continued coldly. "Mr. Frederic, given the circumstances, there's only one proper resolution—a marriage alliance. Your son must wed Arabella."

Gasps filled the room.

"Marry Arabella?"

Nathaniel laughed, his dark eyes glacial. "Mr. Dominic, do you think so little of me that any woman will do? That any woman is worthy of being my wife? I may not chase skirts, but that doesn't mean I lack standards."

The room fell silent, stunned.

Not a single insult, yet every word cut Arabella to the bone.

Her lips trembled, her face white with rage.

"Nathaniel, mind your tongue!" Frederic snapped. He disliked the Vanderbilts' bullying but didn't want an outright feud.

Dominic slammed his cane against the floor. "How dare you insult my granddaughter! She's too good for you!"

"In this life, there is only one woman who will ever be my wife. It was her before, and it will be her in the future."

Before Nathaniel could finish, the butler rushed in. "Mr. Frederic, Mr. Nathaniel—Miss Isabella has arrived!"

The sharp click of heels echoed through the hall—confident, commanding.

Nathaniel's breath caught, his gaze locking onto the stunning figure striding toward them. He memorized every detail, as if imprinting her image into his soul.

Arabella watched, jealousy twisting her features, helpless as Nathaniel's entire being focused on Isabella.

His heart, his eyes—there was room for no one else.

If not for the desperate measures she'd taken, she might never have shared a room with him.

"Mrs. Kingsley!" Olivia gasped.

"It's really her!"

The staff whispered excitedly, their eyes alight with anticipation.

By now, everyone knew—Nathaniel's heart belonged to his ex-wife.

What was she doing here now?

Had she come to rescue him from the Vanderbilts' forced marriage?

Isabella wore a sleek black dress, a tailored velvet blazer draped over her shoulders. Her raven hair cascaded down her back, her lips a bold crimson. She was breathtaking—radiant yet commanding.

Two seemingly contradictory qualities melded perfectly in her, inspiring awe.

One glance from her was enough to crush Arabella, leaving her unable to lift her head.

Mrs. Vanderbilt clutched her chest, her heart pounding.

She'd heard of Isabella's brilliance. Even with the Vanderbilt fortune, they stood no chance against this woman.

"Grandfather, that's Isabella," Arabella whispered urgently. "She's bullied me before. You have to help me!"

Dominic studied Isabella's striking features, his expression conflicted.

Though this was their first meeting, her father, William, was an old acquaintance.

They weren't friends, but William was a man of integrity. He could feud with Frederic, but William's daughter? That gave him pause.

"Good evening, Mr. Frederic. My apologies for intruding." Isabella's smile was polite as she inclined her head toward Dominic. "Isabella Sinclair, at your service, Mr. Dominic."

Her manners were impeccable—exactly what one would expect from William's daughter.

"Grandfather! Why aren't you saying anything? She bullied me! She stole Nathaniel from me!"

Dominic pressed his lips together. He couldn't bring himself to confront a young woman.

As a man of power and pride, bickering with a girl was beneath him.

Nathaniel's gaze burned as he drank in Isabella's beauty.

Logic told him this woman had hurt him deeply—he should be furious.

But his body betrayed him, desire coursing through his veins.

"Miss Isabella, what brings you here so late?" Frederic asked, his tone cool.

"Yes, Miss Isabella," Eleanor added with a smirk. "We're entertaining important guests. If there's news, we'll inform you."

Her words dripped with provocation.

Nathaniel's expression darkened, but before he could speak, Isabella laughed lightly.

"Eleanor, you misunderstand. I have no interest in your family affairs. I'm here to see you."

The room buzzed with confusion.

Eleanor frowned. "Me? Why?"

"Shall we speak privately, or would you prefer I say it here?" Isabella's eyes glinted with icy amusement.
###Chapter 349

The grand hall was deathly silent, the air thick with tension as Isabella's commanding presence sent chills down everyone's spines.

Her aura was just as formidable as Dominic's—a man feared in both legal and underground circles.

Victoria, who had been smirking in anticipation of drama, froze. She'd assumed Isabella had come to confront Nathaniel over the Vanderbilt family's marriage proposal. She thought this was going to be a showdown between Isabella and Evelyn over Nathaniel.

Victoria had been ready for a vicious catfight, but her smirk vanished when Isabella declared she was there for her.

"Ms. Isabella, you're looking for me?" Victoria scoffed, though her eyes betrayed her shock. "I don't recall us having any unfinished business."

"Whatever issues we had ended the day Nathaniel and I divorced," Isabella replied coolly, her tone glacial. "But you still have unfinished business with an old friend of yours."

Her words, though softly spoken, detonated like a bomb, leaving the room in stunned silence.

"Evelyn! What is Ms. Isabella talking about? An ex-wife? What's going on?" Dominic demanded, his face darkening.

"Grandfather, I told you about this," Evelyn said weakly.

"You told me? When? I may be old, but I'm not senile! You never mentioned Nathaniel was divorced!"

Dominic, who had spent most of the year overseas, had no idea Nathaniel had been married before—let alone that his ex-wife was Reginald Sinclair's daughter!

The realization that he'd been deceived made his blood boil.

"Mr. Dominic, what's the big deal about Nathaniel being divorced?" Margaret, who had endured enough of his theatrics, snapped. "Nathaniel is a catch. Even if he divorced ten times, women would still line up to marry him! Besides, isn't your granddaughter desperate to marry him? If she doesn't mind, why should you?"

"Who gave you the right to speak, you insolent woman!" Dominic roared.

"This is the Kingsley estate, not the Vanderbilt mansion. I can say whatever I please," Margaret shot back, turning away dismissively.

Dominic seethed but refused to stoop to arguing with a servant.

William, who had stayed silent, smirked when Margaret put Dominic in his place. He might disapprove of Nathaniel's choices, but no one insulted his son in his own home.

Nathaniel took a deep breath, his pulse racing as he approached Isabella. "Isabella," he murmured, voice low, "if you need to say something, say it to me. I can help you."

"Afraid I'll ruin your precious engagement?"

Isabella's lashes fluttered, her gaze sharp as ice. In a whisper meant only for him, she said, "Relax. I'm not here to sabotage your little meeting. I only came for Victoria. Once I'm done with her, I'll leave."

"I told you—if you're in trouble, I'll help you," Nathaniel insisted, his dark eyes stormy with emotion.

"You can't help me. And I don't want your help."

She turned away, her attention locking onto Victoria. There was no warmth in her eyes.

"Ms. Isabella, you came all this way. Stay for a drink before you go," Victoria said, chin lifted arrogantly. "But between you and me, there's nothing to discuss. As for your so-called 'old friend,' I have no idea what you're talking about."

"Nothing to say about Seraphina?" Isabella's voice was like a blade, slicing through Victoria's composure.

Victoria's heart lurched. Why was Isabella bringing up Seraphina? Had she found out? Had that man betrayed her?

No. Impossible.

Isabella was bluffing.

"Ms. Isabella, perhaps we can talk another time," William interjected, sensing the tension. "As you can see, we have guests. This isn't the best moment."

Before Isabella could respond, Nathaniel grabbed her wrist and dragged her toward the stairs, ignoring her protests. "Nathaniel! Let go of me!" she hissed, cheeks flushing, but his grip was unrelenting.

Once Nathaniel made up his mind, nothing stopped him.

"Oh my!" Margaret gasped, covering her mouth.

Nathaniel was ruthless.

And Mrs. Kingsley was adorable when flustered.

"Nathaniel! Nathaniel, where are you going? Come back here!"

William's shouts fell on deaf ears. Nathaniel and Isabella vanished upstairs, leaving the Vanderbilts standing awkwardly in the hall, the meeting in shambles.

Evelyn, in particular, was trembling with rage.

Every time Isabella appeared, she stole the spotlight. She was the heroine, the center of attention—always.

Evelyn finally understood.

Her hatred for Isabella wasn't just because Nathaniel loved her.

It was because Isabella shone in a way she never could.

In Evelyn's world, she was supposed to be the sun. She couldn't stand being outshone.

"Dad! Mom! I'm home!"

Amelia stumbled in, reeking of alcohol.

She had changed into presentable clothes, but her face was pale, her lips overly red, and dark circles shadowed her eyes. She looked like a ghost.

Victoria recoiled in disgust, wishing she could shove her daughter into a closet. Disgraceful.

"Amelia, where have you been? You smell like a distillery!" William frowned.

"Just had a few drinks with friends," Amelia slurred, belching loudly.

"Someone, take Miss Amelia to her room!" Victoria snapped.

"Oh, Evelyn!"

Drunk and bold, Amelia waltzed over to Evelyn with a mocking grin. "Congratulations! After scheming to get rid of Arabella and Isabella, you're finally marrying my brother! You must be thrilled."

Dominic's expression darkened.

The Vanderbilt women paled.

"Amelia, are you mocking me, or are you just drunk?" Evelyn hissed, her patience snapping.

"I know what you're thinking," Amelia sneered. "You're bitter because you wanted to marry my brother, and when I didn't help you, you held a grudge."

Dominic's gaze turned scathing.

Thank God his grandson had standards. This drunken mess was not fit to be a Vanderbilt.

Amelia's eyes bulged with fury.

Evelyn smirked. "No matter how much you whine, it won't change anything. My brother chose me."

"Pfft." Amelia clutched her chest, laughing bitterly. "The feeling's mutual. My brother doesn't love you either, does he?"

Evelyn's face twisted.

"When I got here, I saw Isabella's limited-edition Bugatti parked outside," Amelia drawled, yawning. "She's already here, huh? And my brother's gone with her, leaving you here like a fool?"

"Amelia!" Evelyn's eyes burned with hatred.

"Oh, Evelyn, darling," Amelia cooed, "you'll get used to it. When he was married to Isabella, he was obsessed with Arabella. Now that he's with you, he still can't forget Isabella. Men are all the same—always wanting what they can't have. Isabella endured it for three years. Since you're so in love with him, I'm sure you'll adjust faster, right?"

The room erupted in gasps.

This wasn't just an argument—it was war.

If the elders hadn't been present, Evelyn would have lunged at Amelia.

"Amelia! Are you out of your mind?!" Victoria shrieked, her blood pressure skyrocketing. "Someone take her away now!"

"Nathaniel! Let me go!"

Nathaniel strode ahead, dragging Isabella with him, her wrist red from his grip.

He was furious.

No—he'd been furious for a long time, and now, she was his outlet.

"Where are you taking me?" Isabella demanded, her almond eyes blazing.

"You were my wife," he growled, not looking back. "This was your home for three years. You know every room here better than I do. So tell me—where do you think I'm taking you?"

"Nathaniel, are you that arrogant, or do you just assume you know me?"

Isabella suddenly yanked her wrist free and bit his arm.

"Ah—!"

Nathaniel hissed in pain, instinctively releasing her.

Isabella stumbled back, rubbing her bruised wrist, glaring at him. "I never considered this place my home. To me, it was always a cage."

The cage hadn't trapped her body—it had trapped her heart.

Nathaniel's chest ached. Even in his rage, the pain was unbearable.

His eyes darkened. Before she could react, he swept her off her feet.

"Ah—!"

Isabella gasped as he lifted her effortlessly, her hands instinctively clutching his shirt.

"Nathaniel! You bastard! Put me down!"
###Chapter 350

Evadne's cheeks burned crimson. Her slender frame twisted in protest, her toned legs kicking wildly against his hold.

Her delicate hands, once clutching his collar, now formed tight fists. She pounded against his unyielding chest with all her strength. Each strike sent a dull ache through her knuckles, yet to him, it was nothing more than playful resistance—something he clearly relished.

"Behave," he warned, voice low and dangerous. "Or I'll carry you out of here myself."

Thaddeus' gaze darkened, though a flicker of something warmer danced beneath the icy surface.

Control? He had none when it came to her.

And if love could be controlled, was it even love at all?

"Listen to you? Why should I?" Evadne spat, her embarrassment fueling her defiance. "Who do you think you are to me? I won't—I refuse!"

His lips curved, predatory. "Keep struggling, and I'll silence you the only way that works."

Her breath hitched. "You wouldn't dare—"

But he did.

With a sudden, wicked grin, he released her.

A startled gasp tore from her lips as gravity yanked her downward. Instinctively, her arms flew around his neck, clinging for dear life.

Cold amusement glinted in his eyes, softening just slightly as he secured her against him once more. Without another word, he hauled her upstairs, leaving the stunned crowd behind.

The Fairhavens stood frozen, humiliation burning through them.

They had come expecting a marriage negotiation. Instead, they were being publicly dismissed.

"Dad," Mrs. Fairhaven hissed, gripping Barry's arm. "This is a disaster. Thaddeus won't even entertain the idea of Edith. He's made that painfully clear."

"Grandpa!" Edith wailed, tears streaking her face. "Are you just going to let them humiliate me like this?"

Barry's jaw clenched. Any other man would have already erupted into curses. But he prided himself on restraint—though it was wearing dangerously thin.

"Mr. Frederic," Barry bit out, his voice trembling with suppressed fury. "Your son has disgraced my granddaughter. And now, he flaunts his ex-wife in front of us? Do you take the Fairhavens for fools?"

With a sharp motion, he snatched a teacup from the table and hurled it to the floor. The porcelain shattered like their fragile negotiations.

At the sound, the Fairhaven bodyguards moved as one, encircling their employers. Elspeth paled, shrinking behind Frederic.

Everyone knew the Fairhavens' reputation. Their underworld roots were no secret in Elmsworth.

This was escalating into a standoff.

"Barry," Frederic growled, "you forget who you're dealing with. The Abernathys don't bow to threats."

Barry smirked. "Oh, I wouldn't dream of resorting to violence. We live in a civilized society, after all." His eyes turned glacial. "But when I'm angry, consequences follow. And your son has made me very, very angry."

Frederic's fists tightened.

This wasn't just a warning—it was a declaration of war.

The Fairhaven Group was a powerhouse, with influence spanning continents. If they allied with the Chambers family, the Abernathys would face unprecedented pressure.

"Grandpa, must you always cause trouble the moment I step away?"

A new voice cut through the tension.

Jareth strode in, his presence commanding immediate attention.

Elspeth's eyes brightened. This was the man she hoped would soon call her "mother."

The Fairhaven guards bowed in unison. "Mr. Jareth."

Barry scowled. "What are you doing here?"

Jareth smirked. "Saving you from embarrassing yourself further."

His gaze swept over the tense gathering before landing on Edith. The hatred in her eyes struck him like a blade.

This wasn't the little sister who once clung to him, begging for ice cream.

"Romantic moment?" Barry scoffed. "Don't be absurd. They're divorced!"

Jareth shrugged. "Love doesn't follow rules. And let's be honest—Evadne outshines Edith in every way. Looks, talent, pedigree. Why would Thaddeus settle for less?"

Barry choked on his retort. He had seen Evadne. There was no denying her allure.

"You're her brother!" Mrs. Fairhaven shrieked. "How can you betray her like this?"

Jareth's expression hardened. "I'm not betraying her. I'm exposing the truth."

He pulled out his phone. "Edith's call records show no contact with Thaddeus before their so-called rendezvous. And then there's this."

He played a recording.

Edith's voice, smug and eager, filled the room.

"Everything's set. I'll be waiting. He will come, won't he? Thank you—I owe you!"

Gasps erupted.

A trap.

Thaddeus had been set up.

"Lies!" Edith screamed, her face contorted with rage. "You edited that! Evadne put you up to this!"

She turned to Barry, sobbing. "Grandpa, how could he do this to me?"

Barry's frown deepened as he studied his granddaughter. Doubt crept in.

Jareth crossed his arms. "The question isn't whether I'm lying. It's who helped you orchestrate this."

Silence fell.

The real puppet master remained hidden.

And the game was far from over.
###Chapter 351

Isabella Sinclair never imagined Alexander Kingsley would carry her back to the bedroom where she'd spent three solitary years.

"What the—"

Alexander meant to place her gently on the bed, but the fiery woman in his arms twisted like an angry kitten. His grip slipped, sending her face-first onto the mattress.

Thankfully, Isabella's nose remained intact. That fall could've ended badly.

"Your own fault for squirming," Alexander muttered, fighting a smirk at her undignified position. "I didn't plan to drop you."

"Men always make excuses," Isabella snapped, pushing up from the bed.

Alexander caught her ankle in one swift motion, pinning her beneath him. "Let go! You some kind of creep?" She kicked wildly, nearly flashing her underwear. Mortification burned through her.

Her struggles proved useless against Alexander's strength. Like challenging an Olympian to arm wrestle.

His grip tightened as his gaze traveled from her flushed cheeks to her cherry lips, down her slender neck to the delicate collarbone peeking from her blouse.

His breath hitched. Blood roared in his ears.

Suddenly, sharp pain lanced through Alexander's skull. He squeezed his eyes shut, palms pressing against his temples. "Isabella...it hurts...so much..."

"Just breathe. It'll pass."

"I'll be gentle with you. Promise."

Unfamiliar memories flooded his mind—sensual moans, tangled sheets, heated whispers. As if he'd shared an intimate night with a woman in this very room.

Impossible. He'd never been with anyone.

Seizing his distraction, Isabella drove her foot into his stomach.

"Get off!"

Though she barely used force, Alexander staggered back, catching himself against the wall.

Isabella's eyes widened. Sweat beaded on his suddenly pale forehead.

Before she could speak, Alexander rasped, "Why did you really come to see Margaret?"

"None of your business." Her gaze turned arctic.

That look pierced Alexander's heart. He gritted his teeth. "If you're here about Cassandra, pick another night. Tonight's not the time."

"Why not?" Isabella arched one perfect brow, sitting up with regal grace. Legs crossed, back straight—every inch the untouchable queen. "Oh, is it because Mr. Vanderbilt, Mrs. Lockwood, and Seraphina are here? Afraid I'll ruin your little matchmaking soirée?"

Alexander's frown deepened. "What soirée?"

"The one where you're courting, discussing marriage plans." Mischief sparkled in her eyes. "Congrattions on your uing nuptials, Mr. Kingsley."

"Shut up!" Alexander's chest constricted, vision tinged red.

Isabella continued as if he hadn't spoken, smile widening. "This time you've outdone yourself. Seraphina's younger, more beautiful, and from the prestigious Vanderbilt family. A two-for-one deal with her brother Nathaniel. Your father must be thrilled."

"You think I care about that?" Alexander's control frayed.

"Honestly? I don't care what you care about." She stood, brushing invisible lint from her dress. "Stay out of my way, and I'll stay out of yours."

She'd come tonight to confront Margaret, not get tangled with this man. Every second in this room choked her.

The walls pulsed with memories—three years of loneliness, of unreciprocated love. And worst of all, the memory of losing her virginity here to a man who still couldn't remember their shared past.

Perhaps forgetting was kinder.

Remembering only brought pain.

As she moved past him, Alexander grabbed her arm and slammed her against the wall with near-savage force.

"Are you insane?" Her vision swam from the impact.

Before her, Alexander's eyes burned crimson. Beautiful. Dangerous.

"Did we ever...you know..." His whisper scorched her ear, making her pulse stutter.

"What?" Her voice cracked.

"Nothing." He shook his head sharply.

Madness. Why ask such a question?

But those phantom memories—moans, tangled limbs—what were they? Some belated teenage fantasy at thirty?

"Enough." Isabella shoved against his chest, cheeks flaming. "You saved my life once. I don't want to hate you. But keep harassing me, and I won't hold back."

"Do you truly despise me that much?" The raw ache in his voice startled them both.

In love's cruel alchemy, even kings could become beggars.

"Alexander, do you know how much I hate this room?" Her gaze lifted to the chandelier she'd stared at through countless sleepless nights. "All I see here is heartbreak. You should be with Seraphina. In her world, you're perfect. In mine? You're just broken pieces that'll never fit back together."

She took a shuddering breath. "I wish us both happiness. In separate lives that never intersect."

"Never again." Alexander released her, pain twisting his features. "Well said, Isabella. Very well said."

He'd wanted to explain. To make her understand.

But suddenly he saw—she didn't want explanations. Didn't care about his innocence.

She wanted him gone. Forever.

The evidence Nathaniel presented, while circumstantial, was damning. Things were escalating.

Thankfully only the Kingsleys and Vanderbilts witnessed tonight's spectacle. Had this happened publicly, Seraphina's reputation would be ruined.

As her brother, Nathaniel wouldn't allow that.

Seeing tensions rise, Reginald Vanderbilt decided to retreat and investigate further. "Nathaniel, Seraphina, we're leaving."

"Going so soon, Mr. Vanderbilt?" A crystalline voice rang out. Isabella descended the staircase with effortless grace, as if Windermere Estate belonged to her. "Have you settled your granddaughter's marriage?"

Margaret's face purpled.

"Ms. Sinclair, what a...surprise." Reginald's smile didn't reach his eyes. "Since you and Mr. Kingsley have history, I'll leave you to...reminisce."

"Oh, we've nothing to reminisce about." Isabella waved a careless hand. "Consider what happened earlier temporary insanity. As his ex-wife, I've never understood what goes on in that handsome head."

Her blunt admission stunned the room.

Alexander, following behind, darkened at her words. Temporary insanity? Really?

Would he have to wait until his next life for this woman to see him clearly?

"Margaret." Isabella's voice turned glacial. "Let's talk."

"I'm tired, Ms. Sinclair. Another time."

"We have all night." Isabella positioned herself before the gathered crowd. "And since you refuse privacy, don't blame me for airing dirty laundry publicly."

Her smile turned lethal. "At Cassandra's birthday gala, when she was attacked by that viin—you were involved, weren't you, Margaret?"

Gasps filled the room. All eyes snapped to Margaret.

The departing Vanderbilts froze.

"Ms. Sinclair!" Margaret's voice shook. "Our past connection doesn't justify these baseless accusations!"

"Fine. Let me rephrase." Isabella's eyes gleamed. "The viin who attacked Cassandra—the one who nearly killed Alexander—he was an old friend of yours, wasn't he?"

An old friend?
###Chapter 352

The room erupted in shock, as if struck by a seismic wave. Every gaze snapped toward Elspeth, eyes wide with disbelief.

Frederic and the Fairhavens were no exception.

Only two remained composed—Evadne, and Thaddeus.

He had suspected Elspeth long before Evadne voiced her doubts. But back then, he'd been recovering from a near-fatal head injury, his investigation derailed by Edith's theatrics.

Tonight, when Evadne confronted Elspeth alone, he'd tried to stop her.

He couldn't bear the thought of her in danger. If Elspeth dared attack Myra in public, she wouldn't hesitate to strike Evadne too.

He would be her shield. Her hands would stay clean.

He'd carry the weight of vengeance.

Yet she hadn't trusted him. The sting of that betrayal still burned, but his love for her eclipsed everything else.

"Elspeth," Frederic's voice was tight. "Is it true? You know this man?"

Elspeth's eyes flashed with wounded indignation. "Frederic, you're questioning me too? Evadne waltzes in with baseless accusations, and now you turn against me?"

Her melodramatic reaction belonged in a soap opera.

Glynnis, now sober, stumbled out of the room, her heart hammering.

Her father had always doted on her mother, defending her against Hamilton's wrath. Yet now, a single word from Evadne had him doubting?

"I'm not questioning you," Frederic said tersely, fists clenched.

"Of course I don't know him!" Elspeth's perfectly coiffed hair clung to her sweat-dampened temples. She glared at Evadne. "You despise me, Evadne. I've let our past grievances go, but now you're pinning your family's misfortunes on me? I'm not your scapegoat!"

Evadne smirked. "Elspeth, why so defensive? I merely asked if you were acquainted. Guilty conscience?"

"Evadne!" Elspeth seethed. "I'm tolerating you out of respect for Emeric and Hamilton. Don't push me!"

Jareth's knuckles whitened, barely restraining himself.

Thaddeus stepped forward, his voice glacial. "Elspeth, if you value your position as Mrs. Abernathy, mind your tone."

The audacity! Thaddeus was nothing but Evadne's attack dog!

"I am the lady of this house," Elspeth spat, "and I won't let some upstart slander me in my own home!"

Evadne's laughter was razor-sharp. "Lady of the house? Does Hamilton acknowledge you as such?"

The room gasped.

Glynnis watched her mother's face drain of color.

Evadne continued, hands in her pockets, radiating arrogance. "Let's be honest—your title exists solely because Frederic pampers you. The Abernathy Group? Elmsworth's elite? None of them recognize you as their matriarch."

She tilted her head. "If we're speaking of true hostesses, it should be Chad's mother—Frederic's lawful wife. Or perhaps Thaddeus's mother, Cynthia Winter."

The name Cynthia hung in the air like a ghost.

Thaddeus's jaw clenched, his nails biting into his palms.

Frederic's breath hitched, murmuring, "Cynthia... Cynthia..."

Elspeth's rage ignited. "Cynthia? That mistress? She was nothing but a servant in this house! How dare you compare her to me?"

"Elspeth!" Frederic roared, startling everyone. "She was not a mistress! And she's dead—show some respect!"

"Respect?" Elspeth sneered. "For a woman who couldn't even secure her place in society?"

A shadow fell over her.

Thaddeus stood before her, eyes black with fury.

Then—crack!

The slap echoed through the hall.

Elspeth staggered, her cheek flaming, blood trickling from her lip.

"You crossed the line," Thaddeus growled. "Cynthia was my mother. You will not insult her."

Frederic stood frozen, whispering Cynthia's name like a prayer.

Elspeth touched her stinging face, staring at the blood on her fingers. "You hit me?"

"Yes," Thaddeus said coldly. "Because unlike you, I honor the dead."

Silence.

The past had risen, raw and bleeding.

Elspeth stumbled back, catching herself on the couch.

"Thaddeus." Evadne's pulse raced, her chest tight with something fierce.
###Chapter 353

The force behind the slap was brutal, holding back just twenty percent of Thaddeus's full strength.

He knew the power in his hands—honed by years of military training, capable of wielding weapons with lethal precision. Had he struck with everything he had, Elspeth wouldn't just be scrambling for her teeth on the floor. She'd be unconscious.

But he didn't want to give her an excuse to flee. Not when Evadne still had unfinished business with her.

The room froze in shock. No one dared intervene.

In this household, even Frederic couldn't control Thaddeus. Who else would dare?

Glynnis shrieked, hands clapped over her mouth, her entire body trembling violently.

Watching her mother get struck, she didn’t even have the spine to step forward.

The Fairhavens stood stunned.

Elspeth had crossed a line, yes, but she was still Frederic's wife—Thaddeus's stepmother, technically an elder. And he’d just slapped her across the face in front of everyone?

The audacity. This wasn’t just a strike against Elspeth. It was a direct insult to Frederic himself.

Only Jareth watched with admiration, a slow smirk curling his lips.

He knew better than anyone how much Thaddeus had endured in this house.

"Frederic, I—I can't hear!" Elspeth wailed, clutching her ears as she collapsed against him. Blood trickled from her lips, her perfectly styled hair now a tangled mess, her makeup smeared by tears. The dignified lady of the house was reduced to a hysterical wreck. "Your son made me deaf! Are you just going to let him do this? How dare he strike an elder?"

Evadne’s sharp eyes caught the blood seeping between Elspeth’s fingers. She glanced at Thaddeus, his expression unreadable, carved from stone.

No doubt about it—Elspeth’s eardrum had ruptured.

Damn, that felt satisfying.

Frederic’s gaze darkened as he studied Elspeth.

There was pain in his chest, but he knew it wasn’t for her. It was for the woman he’d buried in his heart long ago.

"Thaddeus," he said, voice tight. "What’s gotten into you? Striking an elder?"

Thaddeus smirked, cold and mocking. "Elder? What tree did she crawl out from to earn that title? In this family, my grandfather is my elder. You are my elder. Alva is my elder. She doesn’t even rank among those I respect."

"Mr. Thaddeus." Alva, acknowledged, dipped her head gratefully.

Elspeth’s face burned scarlet, humiliation and fury boiling inside her.

Was he implying that even a lowly maid like Alva outranked her?

This bastard!

"I tolerate you for your age and your service to my father. But elder?" Thaddeus laughed, the sound icy. "Don’t flatter yourself."

The Fairhavens exchanged glances. They couldn’t leave now.

This was too entertaining to miss.

"My mother is my line in the sand," Thaddeus said, voice lethally calm. "Cross it, and don’t expect mercy. I’ll take your life without hesitation."

His gaze flicked to Evadne for the briefest second.

He didn’t say it aloud.

She was his line too.

But in her heart, was he even close to Avery?

The thought twisted something inside him. Anger. Frustration. Loss. He forced his eyes away, refusing to look at her again.

Yet at that exact moment, Evadne glanced at him.

Seeing his cold, distant expression, her chest tightened.

Elspeth trembled, her heart lodged in her throat.

Frederic couldn’t control Thaddeus anymore. Her once-solid shield was crumbling.

What if he found out the truth? That she’d been the one to worsen his mother’s depression all those years ago?

She’d be ruined.

She’d bribed Cynthia’s trusted maid to swap her medication—drugs that stimulated the nervous system, worsening her symptoms, inducing hallucinations, making her final months a living hell.

That secret could never come to light.

The day it did would be her last.

"Frederic," she whimpered, clinging to him, tears streaming. "Are you really going to let him treat me like this? I’m your wife."

If aggression failed, she’d play the victim.

She knew his weakness.

Frederic exhaled sharply, his grip on her stiff. "Go clean yourself up. Glynnis and the secretary will take you to the hospital."

"No." Thaddeus’s voice cut through like a blade.

"Thaddeus," Frederic warned.

"A slap won’t kill her," Thaddeus said coldly. "But the matter between Elspeth and Ms. Evadne ends tonight."

Evadne’s fingers curled into her palms.

"How many times must I say it? I had nothing to do with Myra’s situation! I don’t even know the culprit! Evadne is slandering me!" Elspeth shrieked.

"Elspeth," Evadne drawled, smirking. "Maybe you should take Frederic’s advice. Get checked for early-onset dementia."

Elspeth’s face paled. "Evadne!"

Barry Fairhaven arched a brow. "This Ashbourne girl has quite the sharp tongue."

"Indeed," Mrs. Fairhaven muttered disapprovingly.

Barry chuckled. "Nothing wrong with a little fire. Especially when her pedigree matches her temper. Shame she’s already been married once. Otherwise, she’d make a fine match for Jareth."

Mrs. Fairhaven gaped.

Edith’s jaw dropped. "Grandfather! That woman was discarded by Thaddeus! She’s not worthy of my brother!"

"Discarded?" Jareth smirked, eyes glinting. "A woman like Ms. Evadne could divorce a hundred times and still have men lining up to be her next husband."

He leaned in, voice dropping playfully. "Grandfather, I’ll confess—the moment I saw her, I was smitten. Pursued her relentlessly."

Edith seethed.

"You did?" Barry blinked. "And?"

Jareth sighed dramatically. "She wasn’t interested."

Barry huffed. "Not even you? Does she plan to marry God himself?"

But then again, considering her ex was Thaddeus, losing to him wasn’t exactly shameful.

"Alex," Evadne said coolly, turning back to Elspeth. "The rogue who worked at the TV station thirty years ago. Collaborated with you on multiple shows. Served you tea. Even Myra and the directors knew him. Yet you claim you don’t?"

She tilted her head. "If it’s not dementia, then what is it?"

Elspeth’s lips curled. "Just because he knew me doesn’t mean I knew him!"

"Your memory fails you, Elspeth. Let me refresh it."

Evadne descended the stairs gracefully, poised as a queen.

Then she dangled something in front of Elspeth’s face.

A silver lily-shaped platinum pendant.

Elspeth’s blood ran cold.

How?

How did Evadne get this?

Frederic frowned, feeling Elspeth’s violent trembling.

"What is this?" Elspeth snapped, looking away.

"Elspeth," Frederic said slowly. "Isn’t this your necklace?"

Elspeth’s breath hitched.

"You wore it constantly when we first met. Said it was your mother’s keepsake—the only thing left from your past. Then one day, you stopped. Said you’d lost it during filming." His voice hardened. "It was this lily pendant."

Elspeth’s ears rang.

She’d spun so many lies to climb this far. She couldn’t even remember half of them.

"So," Evadne mused, swinging the pendant. "This was your mother’s keepsake. Precious to you."

Her smile turned icy.

"Then how did it end up in that rogue’s hands?"
###Chapter 354

The interrogation room was freezing.

For three relentless days, Alexander had been grilled under the blinding fluorescent lights. His body ached, his mind frayed—but he refused to break.

Every time his resolve wavered, he thought of Elara. And the daughter he could never claim.

He would endure hell itself for them.

The door creaked open.

Aaron Ashbourne strolled in, his posture loose, his expression unreadable. The air around him crackled with danger—this wasn’t the polished heir of the Ashbourne fortune. This was a predator.

"Still holding up?" Aaron yawned, dragging a steel chair across the floor. The screech of metal made Alexander’s teeth grind. "Get him coffee. The night’s just starting."

"Yes, Captain Ashbourne."

Alexander smirked bitterly. "Don’t you get tired of this routine?"

Aaron leaned back, flashing a sharp grin. "Not at all. I’ve got stamina."

"I’ve told you everything. Ask me a thousand times—my answers won’t change."

Aaron’s fingers drummed the table. Then, without warning, he slid a photograph forward.

Alexander’s breath hitched.

The platinum lily necklace glinted in the photo. His pulse spiked, his fingers twitching against the cuffs.

"Recognize it?" Aaron’s voice was deceptively light.

"No."

Aaron laughed. "You kept it wrapped in silk. Locked in a jewelry box. And now you’re telling me you don’t know it?" His smile vanished. "Try again."

"You searched my house?" Alexander’s voice was raw.

"You’re a suspect. Did you think I wouldn’t?" Aaron tilted his head. "This belonged to Elara. Funny how you’ve held onto it all these years. Almost like you were obsessed."

Alexander’s jaw clenched. "I stole it. That’s all."

Aaron’s eyes darkened. "Your old coworkers disagree. They said you followed Elara like a shadow. That you’d do anything for her." He leaned in. "Including murder."

Sweat dripped down Alexander’s temple. "They’re lying."

"Your apartment’s full of Elara’s photos. Not a single one of Myra. No shows, no movies, nothing." Aaron’s voice dropped to a whisper. "You never loved Myra. This was always about Elara."

Alexander’s lips curled. "So what if it was? I killed for her. I’d do it again."

Aaron’s fist slammed the table.

But then—he smiled. Cold. Calculated.

"Let’s talk off the record." He flicked off the recorder. "You think you’re protecting Elara? If the press finds out you two had a special relationship, how long before they turn on her? The Abernathys already hate her. Frederic will think she ordered the hit."

Alexander’s blood ran cold.

"You wouldn’t."

Aaron’s grin was vicious. "Try me."

The Abernathy Mansion

Elara’s hands shook as she clutched Frederic’s sleeve. "That necklace was stolen! I lost it years ago—he must’ve taken it!"

Evadne arched a brow. "Strange. He kept it like a treasure."

Elara’s voice pitched higher. "How would I know what a thief thinks?"

Evadne stepped closer. "Your coworkers say you and Alexander were close. That he’d do anything for you." Her smile was lethal. "Including murder."

Elara’s face drained of color. "You have no proof!"

Frederic’s grip tightened on her arm. "Enough."

Evadne ignored him. "Insult Myra again," she murmured, "and I’ll ruin you."

The room fell silent.

Elara’s lips trembled.

Evadne pocketed the necklace. "No need to rush. The truth always comes out."

As she turned to leave, Mrs. Fairhaven called after her. "Next time, handle your family drama privately."

Evadne didn’t look back. "Or what? You’ll clutch your pearls harder?"

The door shut behind her.

Thaddeus’s knuckles whitened.

He wanted to follow.

But he didn’t.
###Chapter 355

Isabella Sinclair's breath caught in her throat as she watched the scene unfold before her.

Margaret Fairhaven suddenly choked, her hand flying to her chest where her heart was pounding erratically.

"Pathetic," Isabella scoffed, her lips curling in disdain. "You couldn't even outwit Arabella, yet you dare to challenge me?"

"Isabella!" Evelyn Prescott cried out, clinging to Harrison like a lifeline. "How dare you speak to my mother that way? Show some respect!"

Nathaniel Kingsley's expression darkened at the sound of Evelyn's voice, his contempt for her barely concealed.

"Age doesn't automatically command respect," Isabella shot back, her icy glare making Evelyn shrink back in fear.

Evelyn trembled, her lips quivering as she wisely chose not to respond further.

Margaret knew Harrison wouldn't make a scene over something so trivial, but she couldn't help shooting a pleading look at Sebastian, silently urging him to intervene.

Sebastian cleared his throat awkwardly. "Isabella, I—"

Her frosty gaze silenced him mid-sentence, making him quickly change tack. "Let me drive you home. It's late, and the roads aren't safe."

"No need. I have my car."

With that, Isabella turned on her heel and strode out of the mansion, the sharp click of her stilettos echoing through the grand hallway.

Sebastian ran a hand through his hair sheepishly, much to Harrison's visible annoyance. "Let's go," Sebastian announced, leading the Fairhaven family's retreat.

"Oh, my head," Arabella moaned dramatically, collapsing against Frederick as if her bones had turned to jelly. "I feel so faint."

"Always playing the victim," Vanessa muttered under her breath, rolling her eyes. "With acting skills like that, I'm surprised Eleanor kept you under her thumb for so long." Arabella heard every word, her face turning crimson with rage.

Frederick, pale-faced, turned to Vanessa. "Help her to her room."

"Apologies, Mr. Frederick," Vanessa replied coolly. "I only attend to Mr. Nathaniel's needs. And I doubt Arabella would want my assistance anyway."

With that, Vanessa walked away, leaving Frederick speechless.

Nathaniel stood rooted to the spot, his face a mask of conflicting emotions.

"Nate! What are you still doing here?" Sebastian approached, clapping him on the shoulder. "Isabella's leaving. This might be your last chance to explain things between you and my sister."

Nathaniel's breath hitched, his feet suddenly feeling like lead weights.

During the car ride home, Margaret was still seething. Accustomed to being protected by her husband and son, she'd never experienced such humiliation.

"Don't worry, Evelyn," she reassured her daughter through gritted teeth. "This isn't over. I'll make sure you get your revenge."

"But how?" Evelyn wailed. "Sebastian controls everything, and he's so close with Nathaniel and Isabella."

Margaret's lips curled into a sneer. "If he won't let you have Nathaniel, then he can't have that Sinclair girl either. Your grandfather won't allow the Fairhaven name to be tarnished. He'll ensure you marry Nathaniel."

"But Sebastian's so protective!" Evelyn protested. "And he guards Eleanor like she's his most prized possession. How can we possibly get to her?"

"There will be an opportunity," Margaret assured her darkly. "He can't watch her every moment of every day."

As Isabella exited the Windsor Estates and slid into her car, she exhaled deeply, as if escaping a toxic environment. But as she drove away, her grip on the steering wheel tightened.

Under the dim glow of streetlights, Adrian Lockwood leaned casually against his electric blue sports car, his posture relaxed yet elegant. There was no telling how long he'd been waiting, but not a trace of impatience showed on his handsome features.

When Isabella's car approached, his deep-set eyes lit up. He pushed off from the car, waving at her with boyish enthusiasm.

Her car screeched to a halt before him.

"What are you doing here?" Isabella asked as she stepped out, her eyes wide with surprise.

"Waiting for you," Adrian replied, his gaze softening like ripples on a tranquil pond.

"Waiting for me? Why?"

"I pulled some strings to find out you were headed to the Kingsley estate," he explained. "I didn't mean to intrude—just didn't want you facing them alone."

With a self-deprecating smile, he added, "Turns out I couldn't even get past the gates. But seeing you makes the trip worthwhile."

Isabella blinked, a mix of emotions swirling within her. She'd always valued her independence above all else. The idea of someone tracking her movements unsettled her.

"I can handle myself," she said, forcing a smile. "The Kingsleys aren't lions. I lived there for three years, remember? I come and go as I please."

Adrian's expression darkened just as he was about to speak.

In the distance, Nathaniel stood frozen, his handsome face etched with sorrow. He was so still, so pale, he might have been a statue carved from moonlight.

"Adrian, I—" Isabella began, only to be cut off as she was suddenly pulled into a firm embrace.

All at once, she found herself pressed against Adrian's chest, feeling his ragged breath against her skin. His arm around her waist tightened possessively.

"Adrian! What are you doing?" She pushed against his shoulders, panic rising.

To Nathaniel, however, her struggle looked more like coy resistance.

Adrian didn't respond, only pulling her closer, his gaze locking with Nathaniel's as a mocking smirk played on his lips.

Despite Isabella's struggles, he refused to let go.

Nathaniel felt as if a thousand knives were piercing his heart. Watching Isabella in another man's arms was more painful than any battlefield wound.

Pale-faced, Nathaniel turned and staggered away like a man who'd drunk too much whiskey.

As he left, Adrian finally loosened his grip, allowing Isabella to wrench herself free, her eyes blazing with anger.

"Mr. Lockwood, don't ever do that again," she warned, her voice trembling with fury. "Or we can't even be friends."

"I'm sorry, Isabella," he said quickly, his hands hovering awkwardly in the air. "I know you only see me as a friend, and I'm trying to respect that. I lost control. It won't happen again, I swear. Can you forgive me? I was just worried about you."

Isabella sighed in frustration. "I hate when men other than my brothers touch me without permission. Remember that."

Adrian clenched his fists, his heart aching. Why can't you accept me? What about Nathaniel? Even your secretary gets closer to you. Is it just me you reject, Isabella?

"Thanks for your concern. It's late. I should go," Isabella said, suddenly sensing a familiar yet unsettling presence. She turned, but found only empty darkness behind her.

Nathaniel dragged his heavy feet back to the mansion.

"Nate!" Sebastian called out, having stayed behind instead of leaving with the Fairhavens. Seeing Nathaniel return alone, he rushed forward.

But Nathaniel walked right past him, his mind clearly elsewhere.

"Nate! Nate!" Sebastian shouted, grabbing his arm. "Where's Isabella? How did your talk go? Did she forgive you?"

"Why would I need her forgiveness?" Nathaniel replied, his red-rimmed eyes filled with exhaustion. "I've done nothing wrong. I'm tired, Sebastian. If she doesn't want to stay, if no amount of chasing can catch her... then let her go."
###Chapter 356

Isabella's mind was a storm of emotions as she sped back to her villa in Windsor Estates.

She had intended to confront Arabella, but the entire drive home, all she could see was Alexander pressing her against the wall.

His burning gaze had locked onto hers. In the depths of his passionate eyes, her own reflection had been dark and sorrowful. His anger had been laced with helplessness, humiliation—an image she couldn’t shake. Her fingers, white-knuckled around the steering wheel, had gone numb, as if electrified.

His eyes had been filled with affection.

But what did that prove?

Even if his gaze could sear through her, it didn’t change the fact that he was still the same Alexander—sneaking around with Victoria behind her back!

Stepping out of her car with a grim expression, Isabella was startled to find Sebastian, Nathaniel, and Preston waiting for her at the villa’s entrance. "Isabella!"

"Sebastian, Nathaniel, Preston. What are you all doing here?" she asked, forcing a composed tone.

"Nathaniel told us you went to the Vanderbilt mansion alone—without even bringing Preston. What were you thinking, going in there by yourself?"

Sebastian sighed, stepping forward to wrap an arm around her shoulders. "But then we heard Alexander was home tonight. That eased my mind. With him there, he wouldn’t let anyone hurt you."

"Why wouldn’t they hurt me just because he was there?" Isabella frowned, her lips tightening in displeasure.

"Because he cares about you. He’d protect you."

"That’s a terrible joke, Sebastian."

Isabella’s heart twisted, her voice turning sharper. "I was his wife for three years. Three years of humiliation and suffering in the Vanderbilt family because of him, and he never once stood up for me. Now we’re not even strangers. Why would he defend me?"

"Exactly, Sebastian."

Nathaniel stepped forward, hands in his pockets, smirking. "Alexander is a heartless, ungrateful bastard. Even if he didn’t love Isabella, she was still his wife. He had a duty to protect her. But look what he did! A leopard doesn’t change its spots. He barely started pursuing her again, and he’s already back to his old ways!"

"Nathaniel, what ways?" Preston asked, confused.

"He’s back with Victoria—Dominic’s unlucky sister!" Nathaniel’s tongue was as sharp as ever, a trait inherited from their father and uncle, perhaps even sharper.

Preston coughed lightly, choosing not to comment.

"Well, Nathaniel, you certainly have a way with words. Keep going." Isabella nodded in approval.

Suddenly, Sebastian’s expression hardened as he looked past her.

"Mr. Lockwood?"

Startled, Isabella turned.

In the dim glow of the streetlights, Adrian’s sleek sports car was parked a short distance away. The engine was off, the lights dark—so silent it might as well have been invisible.

He hadn’t stepped out. Instead, he sat in the driver’s seat, leaning forward, forearms resting on the steering wheel, his gaze fixed intently on her.

Isabella bit her lip, meeting his eyes.

She didn’t greet him. She didn’t approach.

Under the faint light, she could see Adrian slowly lower his body, burying most of his striking face in his arms, leaving only his hauntingly lonely eyes visible.

That wounded, pitiful look—like a lost puppy—was the same expression he’d worn fifteen years ago when she’d seen him being punished by his father in the rain.

"Wait, when did he follow us here? Didn’t even make a sound. Creepy." Nathaniel shuddered, a chill running down his spine.

Sebastian glanced at Adrian’s car, then back at Isabella with a complicated expression. "He followed you to the Vanderbilts?"

"Yes."

Just then, the sports car roared to life, turned smoothly, and vanished into the night.

"Huh? He just left?"

Nathaniel frowned in disbelief. "Isabella, who are these men chasing after you? Either they’re scoundrels or stalkers. How am I supposed to rest easy when you’re out there alone?"

"Let’s focus."

Isabella didn’t want to dwell on Adrian. She turned serious. "Nathaniel, what’s the update on Dominic’s side? Is he still refusing to talk?"

Nathaniel exhaled in frustration. "It might take more time. That bastard is more loyal than we thought. He’s devoted to Arabella. Anyone would think they’re married!"

"I expected that. He was willing to kill for her. Of course he wouldn’t crack easily."

Isabella crossed her arms, her gaze icy. "That’s why I told you to interrogate him my way. Break his will. When his defenses are weak, we strike—right at his feelings for Arabella."

"Isabella, whatever you need, we’re with you!" Nathaniel rubbed his hands together, eager to make them pay.

"But just having Dominic testify against Arabella isn’t enough."

Isabella clenched her fists, fury blazing in her eyes. "For all the humiliation my mother endured because of her, for all the pain she caused, I want her to suffer a hundred—no, a thousand times over!"

"Isabella, Nathaniel, I think we should dig deeper into Dominic and Arabella’s relationship."

Sebastian’s expression was stone-cold, his eyes sharp with logic. "Arabella ordering Dominic to hurt your mother must’ve been impulsive. The fact that one call from her could make him kill without hesitation means they’ve been in contact all these years. There are probably countless shady dealings no one knows about—all carried out by him on her behalf."

"Exactly. They might even have a secret love child. Reginald probably married a woman who’s been unfaithful this whole time and never even realized!" Nathaniel sneered.

Isabella took it as a joke—but couldn’t help considering it seriously.

If true, it would be the ultimate scandal. Arabella would never recover.

But Arabella, with her pride as Reginald’s wife—would she really stoop so low as to have an affair with a lowly extra?

"Hmph, if they really did have an affair, I hope Genevieve is the illegitimate child. Then this treacherous mother-daughter pair can be thrown out of the Vanderbilt family. Finally, justice for Mrs. Sinclair!" Preston gritted his teeth.

Isabella paused, then asked softly, "Sebastian, has Oliver contacted you? When is he bringing the Bright family’s son to Windsor Estates?"

"Oliver called. Said he’s still negotiating with the Bright heir. He’ll bring him to you as soon as possible."

Sebastian’s large hand gently squeezed her shoulder. "Don’t worry. You have me. Whatever you want, I’ll get it for you. Whatever you want to achieve, I’ll make it happen."

"And me! I’ll help too!" Nathaniel raised his hand eagerly, eyes sparkling.

"And me, Mrs. Sinclair." Preston gave her his usual warm smile.

Isabella’s heart softened. She leaned lightly against Sebastian’s shoulder, feeling some of her exhaustion fade.

Late that night, Dominic returned to his love nest with Genevieve, his expression troubled.

A light snow had begun to fall before he reached home. By the time his car pulled up to the villa, Lillian was already waiting at the door, holding a large black umbrella.

"Mr. Blackwood, you’re back."

Seeing him step out, she quickly bowed, shielding him from the snow while she stood exposed.

"Where’s Genevieve? Is she asleep?" Dominic asked urgently.

"She refused to sleep until you came home. I couldn’t persuade her."

Lillian smiled helplessly but fondly. "Don’t scold her. She was just worried about you."

Dominic’s throat tightened. Warmth spread through him as he strode inside.

Not wanting Genevieve to feel any chill, he changed into the pajamas Lillian had laid out downstairs, then crept upstairs, hoping to surprise his delicate wife.

He pushed the bedroom door open gently. The bedside lamp was still on, a half-read copy of The Nightingale and The Rose lying on the sheets—but Genevieve was nowhere in sight.

His heart skipped a beat. Just as he was about to call her name, he heard faint rustling from the bathroom.

Without hesitation, he moved toward the sound.

Suddenly, silence.

"Genevieve?!"

Ever since falling for her, Dominic had treasured her like a fragile bloom, constantly paranoid about her safety.

The sudden quiet terrified him. He lifted his leg and kicked the door open—nearly sending it off its hinges!

"Ahh!"

Genevieve, standing in front of the mirror, shrieked in fright. She clutched her head, spinning to face him—

Dominic froze, his Adam’s apple bobbing as a rough sound escaped him.

His heated gaze trailed down—from her delicate face to her damp, smooth skin, finally landing on the full, rounded curves of her chest.

They’d seemed modest under clothes. Now, exposed, they were lush and perfect.

His mind blanked. Lust darkened his eyes. His fingers twitched, aching to touch.

"Ahh!"

Recognizing him, Genevieve screamed again. She squeezed her eyes shut, arms crossing over her chest as she spun away.

But it was too late.

Naked and vulnerable, her slender back was now on full display—only making his pulse race faster.

"Genevieve, I—" Dominic’s voice was hoarse, his breathing ragged.

"I just showered. I didn’t know you’d be back." Trembling, her voice was both enticing and pitiful.

The steam-filled bathroom only heightened the tension between them.

Unable to resist, Dominic stepped forward, his forehead damp with sweat.
###Chapter 357

Isabella heard the heavy footsteps approaching from behind, but she couldn't bring herself to turn around. Instead, she wrapped her arms around her delicate shoulders, trembling like a startled fawn.

The sound only made Alexander seem more imposing—like a predator ready to strike.

"Isabella." His voice was rough, his eyes tinged with red.

His hand lifted, trembling with restraint, aching to touch her porcelain skin. Just then, Isabella murmured, "I just showered. I still need to apply lotion. I couldn't reach my back. Otherwise, I would've been in bed... waiting for you."

Alexander's breath hitched. His fingertips burned. Every nerve in his body screamed.

He'd seen countless women before—some brazen, others desperate. None had ever made his pulse race like this, leaving him utterly undone.

"Alexander... will you help me?" Isabella's voice was barely a whisper, her shoulders quivering.

"May I?"

His voice was thick with need. Isabella bit her lower lip, then slowly lowered her arms and nodded.

Alexander's heart hammered as he reached for the bottle. He squeezed the lotion into his palm, then carefully smoothed it over her flawless skin with his large, veined hands.

"I won't do anything. I won't."

This was his ultimate test.

He repeated the mantra in his head, fighting the fire in his veins. But the moment his fingers brushed her, restraint shattered. He yanked her against him, his gaze molten with hunger.

"Alexander." Her voice was breathless, cheeks flushed like she'd drunk too much wine.

"Don't say my name." His rough tone sent shivers down her spine.

"Alexander."

"Say it again, and I can't promise I'll stop."

"Alexander."

The next second, she was lifted off her feet.

Alexander's strong hands gripped her waist, seating her on the edge of the bathtub where a towel had been conveniently placed. Her hips settled perfectly against it.

Isabella turned crimson, her lips parting in a silent gasp.

His rough touch left faint marks on her skin, spreading like wildfire across her trembling body.

A soft whimper escaped her.

She clutched at his toned waist for balance, her arms winding around his neck.

Alexander's mind went blank. He crushed his mouth to hers, kissing her with a desperation that bordered on violence.

It had been too long. His kiss was fierce, almost punishing. Isabella melted into him, her lips and tongue aching—yet the pain only heightened the pleasure coursing through her.

"Isabella... if you want me to stop, bite me."

He pulled back just enough to speak, his breath hot against her lips.

The steam in the bathroom had long since faded. Now, sweat glistened on his skin as if they'd already made love.

"If you don't want this—"

Before he could finish, Isabella sank her teeth into his lower lip, then kissed him back with clumsy sweetness.

Ecstasy flooded him. She hadn't spoken, but her answer was clear—in the blush on her ears, the love in her eyes, the rapid rise and fall of her chest.

That night, they loved each other—from the bathroom to the living room, and finally, the bed.

Isabella's soft, delicate skin drove him wild.

He'd never felt so fulfilled—body and soul.

Exhausted, Isabella collapsed against his chest, her slender frame trembling.

Alexander, sated like a lion after a feast, watched her with lazy satisfaction.

One arm held her close, his hand gently stroking her back. The other lifted the sheets.

A single crimson bloom stood stark against the white fabric.

He couldn't help but smile, his heart swelling. He kissed her again, deeply, possessively.

"Mmm... tickles." She barely stirred, lost in sleep.

"Isabella... you're mine now."

He nuzzled her hair, fingertips tracing the curve of her arm. His whisper was a vow: "The hard days are over. I'll love you forever... Mrs. Kingsley."

The sharp crack of the slap echoed in Seraphina's ears, loosening a tooth.

How much hatred did he have to hit her that hard?

Vanessa rushed Seraphina to the hospital. The entire ride, Seraphina clutched her face, spewing curses at Evelyn and Nathaniel. The more she ranted, the angrier—and more painful—it became.

The driver stared, stunned, in the rearview mirror.

Who would believe the usually poised Mrs. Lockwood could be this vicious?

"What are you looking at?!"

Vanessa caught his gaze and snapped, "Drive and keep your mouth shut! If word of this gets out, your family won't survive in Elmhurst!"

"Y-Yes, Ms. Lockwood!" The driver paled and focused on the road.

"Useless girl! All my love wasted on you!"

With no one else to vent on, Seraphina jabbed Vanessa's forehead hard, making her stumble. "You just stood there while that brat Evelyn humiliated me? Not a single word from you!"

"I couldn't win against Evelyn! Interfering would've backfired!"

Vanessa clenched her fists. "Why blame me? What about Isabella? She's off fooling around with men while you suffer! What does Mr. Kingsley even see in her? He must be blind!"

"Ha! You dare compare yourself to your sister? She snagged Alexander without lifting a finger! Being his mother-in-law is an honor—far better than your pathetic groveling!" Seraphina's disdain was palpable.

She'd tried to deny it, but Vanessa was hopeless. No matter how she was raised, her lowly nature couldn't be erased. She was worse than Seraphina's defective child with Reginald!

If only she'd focused on Isabella sooner. What a waste!

At the hospital, after treatment, Seraphina was admitted.

She lay in bed, her cheek swollen, her ear throbbing too much to sleep. Fear gnawed at her.

She dreaded Evelyn uncovering her affair with Adrian. Worse—the truth that Vanessa's real father wasn't Reginald, but Adrian.

If that got out, they were finished.

Seraphina stayed three days, Vanessa by her side.

By the third day, the swelling had faded—but Reginald never came.

Vanessa called repeatedly, asking when he'd visit. His replies were cold dismissals.

She expected Seraphina to break down. What woman wouldn't crumble if her husband abandoned her in the hospital?

But Seraphina remained eerily calm. No tears. No outbursts. Just... normal.

It unsettled Vanessa.

In her memory, Seraphina couldn't live without Reginald.

Now, staring at her mother's icy expression, Vanessa wondered if she'd ever loved him at all.

"Mom, Dad hasn't come in three days. Aren't you worried?"

"Men are all the same. The more you cling, the more they pull away. Indifference is the only way." Seraphina smiled, but her mind raced.

She hadn't contacted Reginald—not out of pride, but fear.

She was ready to leave, but she stayed, hiding under the guise of recovery.

That night with Evelyn, she'd seen the suspicion in Reginald's eyes.

She needed time to think—to salvage this.

Just then, the door opened.

"Wait outside. I'll see my wife alone."

"Yes, Mr. Lockwood."

At Reginald's voice, both women froze.

Seraphina grabbed her compact, dusting her lips pale to appear frail.

As he entered, she slumped weakly against the pillows, eyes brimming with tears.

"Vanessa, I'm so thirsty. Could you...?"

The tears fell on cue, reminding Vanessa of that deceitful woman, Lillian, who'd vanished without a trace.

"Dad! You're here!" Vanessa feigned surprise.

Reginald's gaze locked onto Seraphina. His expression was unreadable, but his stare made her skin crawl.

"Vanessa, you've done enough. A maid will take over. Go home and rest."

"Of course. Mom, Dad... I'll go."

Vanessa shot Seraphina a meaningful look before slipping out.

"Ms. Lockwood, let me drive you." The bodyguard offered.

"No. Give me the keys. I need to clear my head."

Vanessa headed to the parking garage, frustration simmering.

Three days in that sterile hellhole left her craving a hot bath and new clothes.

As she reached her car, a sharp pain pierced her neck.

"Ah—!"

Darkness swallowed her.

Behind her, Natalia's cold smile appeared.

"Take her away."

Two shadows emerged, dragging Vanessa into the night.
###Chapter 358

The hospital room was suffocating with unspoken tension.

Isabella Sinclair had once been Harrison Kingsley's entire world. The man might neglect his duties to the company, but whenever Isabella showed the slightest discomfort, Harrison would drop everything to be by her side, no matter how packed his schedule was.

Three days without a visit? Unheard of. Until now.

"Harrison."

Isabella leaned weakly against the pillows, her lips trembling as she wiped away a smudge of faded lipstick. Her eyes shimmered with unshed tears as she gazed at him. "You've been so busy lately, haven't you? With corporate affairs and everything... I understand. It's nothing serious—just a perforated eardrum. The surgery's already done."

Before she could finish, Harrison cut her off, his voice grave. "Isabella, I came here to ask you something. Was what Evelyn said true?"

Isabella froze. Her pupils flickered like candle flames in the wind. "Harrison, how could you doubt me? I'm your wife! You know me better than anyone! I gave you two daughters—I nearly died giving birth to Sophia! I've sacrificed so much for you. How could I possibly be involved with a murder suspect? Harrison! Do you not love me anymore? When love fades, everything becomes suspicious, doesn't it?"

Her words were sharp, but beneath them, her heart hammered with terror.

Her indignation was nothing but a shield for the panic clawing at her insides.

"I'm not talking about that man, Adrian. Whatever history you have with him, I'll uncover it myself."

Harrison's gaze never wavered. "I'm talking about Victoria. Did you orchestrate the attack on Victoria?"

"No! No! It wasn't me!"

Isabella's voice cracked as she vehemently denied it. "Why would I hurt her? What would I gain? Why would I take such a risk?"

Harrison simply watched her, his fingers tightening around the phone that had grown warm in his grip.

Over the past three days, he'd discreetly investigated the connection between Isabella and Adrian. While it wasn't as damning as Evelyn had claimed—that Isabella had given Adrian her name as a token of love—there was truth to it. Isabella did know Adrian. They had been in contact.

And then there was the call log.

Though Isabella's phone showed no records of communication with Adrian, Harrison had checked Sophia's call history.

One number stood out—unfamiliar, unregistered, its location matching Adrian's hideout.

Harrison's stomach twisted.

His daughter, raised among elites, had never mingled with the dregs of society. She wouldn't even know how to find the slums, let alone venture there.

There was only one explanation for Sophia contacting Adrian.

"Isabella," Harrison exhaled sharply, his voice low. "Do you know what first drew me to you?"

Isabella blinked, caught off guard.

She'd always assumed it was her beauty, her youth. Men were simple creatures, after all—drawn to pretty faces and little else.

But she'd forgotten one crucial detail.

As the heir to the Kingsley empire, Harrison had his pick of society's finest—debutantes, starlets, heiresses. Yet none had captured his heart.

Back then, Isabella had been a nobody—an actress with mediocre looks and no pedigree.

So why had he chosen her?

"Because of your eyes," Harrison said quietly. "They were clear. Untouched by deceit. You made me want to protect you, to cherish you. With you, I felt like the man I was meant to be."

Isabella's breath hitched.

Clear? Untouched?

Those words didn't describe her. They sounded more like they belonged to Evelyn Ashbourne—the woman Harrison had truly wanted.

The thought made her blood boil.

"But it seems you don't need my protection anymore," Harrison continued, his voice hardening. "You've learned to fight your own battles—using whatever means necessary to destroy those who cross you."

His eyes darkened. "But this is the last time. From now on, you will behave. No more harming innocents. No more dragging the Kingsley name through the mud. Or I will send you away—far from Elmsworth, far from the chaos you've created."

The threat struck like a slap.

Isabella's entire body stiffened, shock and fury warring inside her.

"Harrison, what are you saying? You're discarding me? Locking me away like some unwanted mistress? Is this because of Evelyn's lies? Or is it because you've set your sights on Emeric Ashbourne's daughter? Using me as an excuse to replace me?!"

"Enough!" Harrison roared, his composure shattering.

"Did I strike a nerve?" Isabella sneered, her voice dripping with venom. "You're guilty, aren't you? When Victoria was still on the runway, the rumors about you two were everywhere! They said you pulled strings for her, that you wanted to keep her!"

Harrison's jaw clenched, his silence deafening.

"She was the one you really wanted, wasn't she? I was just the consolation prize!"

The words spilled out like poison, festering for years. Isabella was equal parts enraged and relieved. "If Victoria hadn't ruined herself with drugs, she would've been the lady of the Kingsley estate—not me!"

"Shut your mouth," Harrison growled, a vein throbbing at his temple.

"You adored her, defended her—yet when she humiliated herself on stage, where were you? Why didn't you rush to her side like Emeric? Why didn't you marry her then? Because you were afraid! Afraid a scandal would tarnish your precious reputation!"

Harrison snapped.

His hand lashed out before he could stop it.

The slap echoed through the room.

Isabella reeled, her cheek burning, tears streaming down her face.

Harrison staggered back, horrified. He'd never struck a woman before. But Isabella had pushed him too far.

"You hit me?"

Her voice was a whisper, trembling with disbelief. Then, like a switch flipping, she sprang from the bed, bare feet slapping against the cold floor as she bolted for the balcony. "If this is how you treat me, I'd rather die!"

Harrison's blood ran cold. "Stop her!"

The door burst open. His secretary and bodyguard lunged forward, grabbing Isabella just as she reached the railing. They hauled her back like a criminal, her face streaked with tears, her dignity in tatters.

"Assign two maids to watch her. You two guard the door. If anything happens to her, it's on you," Harrison ordered, his voice hollow.

"Yes, Mr. Kingsley!"

Without another glance at Isabella, Harrison turned and walked out, his footsteps heavy with exhaustion.

Isabella collapsed to the floor, legs giving way beneath her.

Tears hadn't worked. Tantrums hadn't worked. Even threatening suicide hadn't made him stay. He hadn't even looked back.

Did Harrison no longer love her?

Or had he never loved her at all?

A hysterical laugh bubbled up from her throat, startling the guards. "Mrs. Kingsley, are you—"

"Good," she whispered, her smile chilling. "We're finally on the same page."

He never loved her.

And she?

She never loved him either.

But Harrison would never know the truth—that the woman he'd truly loved, the one he'd secretly yearned for all these years, had been destroyed by her hand.

Pain.

That was the first thing Sophia Kingsley registered when she woke.

Her head throbbed. Her limbs ached. The air smelled damp, musty—like rotting wood and mildew.

Blinking against the dim light, she realized she was in an abandoned warehouse.

And she wasn't alone.

Two rats scurried past her feet.

"Ah!" She scrambled back, grabbing a broken brick and hurling it at them. The rodents darted away, their squeaks almost mocking.

"Hello? Is anyone there? Help!"

Just as her screams reached a fever pitch, the warehouse door creaked open.

A silhouette stepped into the sliver of light—a woman, curves accentuated by a tight leather suit, every inch the femme fatale.

"It's you," Sophia gasped. "You're the woman with Mr. Fairhaven!"

Lily smirked, adjusting her gloves. "Good evening, Ms. Kingsley. You were out for quite a while. I was starting to get bored."

"Did you kidnap me?" Sophia's voice shook with rage. "Do you have a death wish? I'm the heiress to the Kingsley Corporation! Let me go now, or I'll ruin you!"

Lily's grin widened.

Seeing words weren't working, Sophia bolted for the door, screaming. "Help! Some—"

A sharp kick to her stomach sent her flying.

She crashed onto the concrete, pain exploding through her body. Every bone felt shattered. Every breath was agony.

And Lily?

She just stood there, smiling.
###Chapter 359

"You struck me. I'm Glynnis Abernathy!"

Glynnis writhed on the ground, her body slick with sweat, moaning and curling into herself like a wounded insect.

But the more she screamed, the weaker her voice became, fading into pathetic whimpers.

How could a woman's kick be this devastating? It was inhuman!

"You're Glynnis Abernathy, so what? You're not Mari Abernathy. What's stopping me from hitting you?"

Lily smirked, rolling her neck, her gaze so icy it sent shivers down Glynnis' spine. "Your life only matters to you. To me, you're no different from that rat in the corner."

Humiliation burned through Glynnis.

Clenching her teeth, she forced herself up, summoning a surge of defiance, ready to fight this demon in human skin.

But before she could even steady herself, Lily's boot slammed into her ribs again—harder this time.

Glynnis collapsed like a broken doll, sprawled in an undignified heap. Pain twisted her insides, her face streaked with tears, snot, and dirt, making her look even more pitiful than the rodent she'd been compared to.

Lily wasn't a man. She had no reservations about beating a woman senseless. Just as she raised her foot for another strike, Jareth's cool voice crackled through her earpiece.

"Enough, Lily. You're overdoing it. One more hit and she might not make it."

Lily lowered her foot. "Understood."

Glynnis whimpered, barely conscious, catching fragments of the brutal woman's conversation but unable to decipher the words.

"You're letting her off?"

"Just slap her around a little. Wake her up." Jareth's tone was lazy, dripping with amusement.

Meanwhile, inside the sleek Rolls Royce, the warehouse scene played out on the car's screen.

Jareth watched Glynnis' suffering with cold satisfaction.

No, satisfaction wasn't enough.

Every cruelty she'd inflicted on Mari flashed through his mind. He wanted to break her bones, cut out her tongue, crush her hands—make her pay tenfold for every tear Mari had shed.

But Mari was still the Abernathy heiress. He didn't yet control Fairhaven Group. Starting a war now would only hurt Mari.

He wasn't afraid of chaos—he was afraid of dragging her into it.

The thought of their uncertain future weighed on him, a heavy pressure in his chest.

His breath ghosted over the delicate ear of the woman curled against him.

"Mmm..."

Mari stirred, blinking sleepily up at him.

"Did I wake you?" Jareth's voice was rough. He pressed a kiss to her flushed earlobe, savoring the warmth of her skin.

He could never get enough of her. Holding her, kissing her—it was never enough.

"No, I was already awake."

Though still innocent in many ways, Mari had grown bolder since their first night together. Now, as Jareth's lips trailed down her neck, she recognized the hunger in his touch.

Her cheeks burned, and she buried her face in his chest, knowing exactly what he wanted.

"Don't move. Let me kiss you."

Jareth tilted her chin up, his tongue claiming her mouth with possessive heat.

Mari melted into him, dizzy, pliant, letting him take whatever he desired.

The air in the car grew thick, charged with need. Then—

CRACK.

A sharp slap echoed through Jareth's earpiece, loud enough to make him wince. He pulled back, removing the earpiece with a frown.

"Jareth, is that my sister?" Mari's grip tightened around his waist as she stared at the screen, where Lily was mercilessly striking Glynnis.

"Yes. Who else could be that repulsive?" Jareth watched Glynnis' swollen, bloody face with disgust.

Mari flinched as Lily yanked Glynnis up by her hair and delivered another brutal slap.

Glynnis' once-beautiful features were now a grotesque mess—her lips split, nose broken, eyes swollen shut.

Lily was a trained fighter. Every strike was precise, brutal.

"I was wrong! Stop! Please!" Glynnis sobbed, her words slurred by her swollen tongue.

The more she begged, the darker Jareth's satisfaction grew.

"Why are you hitting her?" Mari trembled, shaking his arm. "Make Lily stop!"

"My love, why should I?" Jareth stroked her cheek.

My love.

The endearment sent a flush creeping down Mari's neck.

"I told you—I won't just protect you. I'll make sure anyone who hurts you regrets it for the rest of their miserable lives."

His voice was soft, but his eyes were glacial. "Glynnis has gotten away with tormenting you for too long. She'll repay every ounce of pain she's caused you—ten times over. And this is just the beginning."

Mari's chest tightened.

The man before her was still tender, still hers—but his gaze had shifted into something terrifying.

She knew this side of him existed. To the world, he was a predator. Only with her did he show gentleness.

Sometimes, she didn't agree with his methods. But that never stopped her from loving him.

"Just relax and enjoy the show," Jareth murmured, pulling her closer. "Staying cooped up at home is dull. Fresh air and a little entertainment will do you good."

Mari watched Glynnis' battered form, fear clawing at her throat. "Jareth! Please, spare her! She's my sister! Mom's favorite!"

Her pleas grew frantic, her nails digging into his arm.

Something in Jareth's expression shifted. He wrapped his arms around her and ordered Lily to stop.

Lily obeyed instantly, releasing Glynnis' hair.

Glynnis crumpled to the floor, her sobs the only sound left in the warehouse.

"Stop! Just stop!" Mari was crying now, her tears soaking Jareth's shoulder.

"Alright. It's over." Jareth cradled her, stroking her back. "Don't cry, sweetheart. I'll always listen to you."

Zoey, Jareth's longtime driver, watched in awe.

This girl was a miracle.

Since Mr. Fairhaven's death, Jareth had lived in darkness—violent, cynical, devoid of love.

But Mari changed him. She made him human again.

Mari's sobs slowly quieted, her body limp against Jareth's.

Each shuddering breath she took twisted his heart.

Her innocence often made him forget—she wasn't like other women. She had autism.

He'd searched tirelessly for a cure, consulting specialists worldwide. All they offered was patience, time, and unwavering support. A long, grueling road few could endure.

But he would.

Mari was his. He'd chosen her. He would never let her go.

"Jareth, thank you," Mari whispered. "Thank you for sparing her."

"She hurt you. Humiliated you. Why protect her?" Jareth's voice was gentle, but his brows furrowed in frustration.

Mari sniffled. "Because she's my sister. Mom and Dad love her. Seeing her hurt would break their hearts."

The logic was baffling.

To earn her parents' affection, she'd forgive the one who tormented her.

Jareth's chest ached, sharp needles of pain spreading through him.

"Mari, you're too kind."

So kind it hurt.

She was the light that had shattered his darkness—so pure, so incompatible with his world, yet he'd cling to her forever.

Just as the thought settled, Mari suddenly lifted her head. Her soft lips brushed against his Adam's apple.

Jareth's control snapped.

Heat coiled low in his stomach, his body tightening with need.

"Jareth... do you want to do it here?" Mari murmured, pulling back slightly.

She didn't know how else to phrase it.

The innocent question nearly undid him.

Zoey, sensing the shift, discreetly raised the privacy partition.

The car became their own secluded world.

"Mari, you're playing with fire," Jareth growled, sweat beading on his brow. His hands slid possessively over her curves.

"No, I'm not. I just wanted to thank you." She blinked up at him, pouting. "But forget it. Pretend I didn't say—"

Jareth crushed his lips to hers, swallowing her words.

His tongue plunged into her mouth, claiming her with desperate hunger.

His hands roamed, leaving faint red marks on her delicate skin.

"What's said is said, darling."

Jareth loosened his tie, his voice a dark promise. "You started this. Now you'll put out the fire."
###Chapter 360

Midnight.

Isabella Sinclair emerged from her steaming bath, wrapping herself in a delicate peach silk robe. Her damp hair was tucked neatly into a towel, her cheeks flushed pink from the heat. A soft hum escaped her lips as she descended the stairs.

Despite the chaos that had recently upended her life, she knew better than to despair. She was, after all, a Sinclair. There was nothing she couldn’t conquer—except for one man.

The mere thought of Alexander Kingsley sent a sharp pang through her chest.

She had truly believed he loved her. Somewhere along the way, she had even begun to trust him.

But reality had struck hard.

Men were either faithless or cruel.

And Alexander was no different.

The more she dwelled on it, the tighter her jaw clenched.

"Ms. Sinclair, I made chamomile tea. It’s calming and won’t affect your figure."

Standing in the living room, Nathaniel Whitmore was impeccably dressed in his usual suit and tie, though now adorned with an apron. His warm smile was meant to comfort her.

Seeing him fussing over her like this, Isabella felt an unexpected twinge of guilt. "Nathaniel," she said gently, "you’re my assistant, not my housekeeper. I’ll have Margaret send someone from the estate to handle meals. You’ve done enough today."

"But Ms. Sinclair," Nathaniel protested, suddenly worried his position was in jeopardy, "Mr. Sinclair assigned me to you not just for work, but to ensure your well-being. That’s always been the arrangement."

Isabella shook her head. "I’ve told you before—focus on someone who deserves your attention. Like Seraphina."

At the mention of Seraphina, Nathaniel’s hands clenched.

"You’re already stretched thin working for me. Don’t waste your energy on trivial things. Just treat Seraphina well. That’s all I ask." Isabella’s tone was firm. She cared deeply about her sister’s happiness.

"Ms. Sinclair, Seraphina and I are just friends."

"Nathaniel, any updates from the hospital?" Isabella wasn’t in the mood for explanations. Love was the last thing on her mind.

All she wanted was to make Cassandra Whitmore suffer.

Nathaniel hesitated, pressing his lips together. "According to our sources at the hospital, just as you predicted, Cassandra and Harrison had a massive fight. Harrison hasn’t been back since. Congratulations, Ms. Sinclair—your plan worked perfectly."

"Once doubt takes root, Harrison will never see Cassandra the same way again. Her life in the Vanderbilt family will only get worse."

A cold smirk curled Isabella’s lips. "As long as they’re divided, and we keep pushing Cassandra, she’ll eventually reveal her true nature."

To break someone, you had to drive them to madness.

"One more thing," Nathaniel added. "I looked into Cassandra’s routine as you asked. She visits a cosmetic clinic weekly, where she’s… quite close with a certain plastic surgeon. He’s in his forties. Charming, apparently."

Now that was interesting.

"Got it."

Crossing her arms, Isabella scoffed. "He’s forty and probably not as… energetic as a younger man. For someone like Cassandra, who has… certain appetites, can he really satisfy her?"

Nathaniel cleared his throat. "In my opinion, that doctor might be the one suffering."

"One pays for beauty, the other for pleasure. A fair trade."

Suddenly, the doorbell rang.

"Who could that be at this hour?" Nathaniel frowned.

"Nathaniel, answer it. It’s a guest I invited."

A guest? She hadn’t mentioned anything.

Without another word, Nathaniel went to the door.

Standing there was a young woman in her twenties, dressed in a simple tracksuit and a black baseball cap.

"Can I help you?" Nathaniel eyed her warily.

"I—I’m Evelyn. I work for the Vanderbilts. I take care of Ms. Vanderbilt." The girl spoke nervously, glancing around.

Realizing she was one of Arabella’s maids, Nathaniel stepped aside.

"Evelyn, I’m sorry I couldn’t pick you up myself. I hope the trip wasn’t too difficult." Isabella hurried over, taking the girl’s cold hands and leading her inside. "You must be freezing. I told you to take a cab—don’t skimp on things like that."

"It’s fine. The bus and light rail were easy." Evelyn’s cheeks were red from the cold.

Once a Vanderbilt lady, now seeing the genuine concern in Isabella’s eyes, Evelyn felt a lump form in her throat.

Thinking of Evelyn walking through the biting wind, Isabella’s chest tightened. She knew the girl was trying to save money.

Nathaniel quickly brought her tea and a hand warmer.

Once settled, Evelyn finally spoke. "Ms. Sinclair, thank you for your kindness—for everything you’ve done for Ms. Vanderbilt."

Her voice was soft but firm. "I saw how you treated her at the Vanderbilts. I’d do anything for you—for her sake."

Isabella studied the girl’s earnest eyes—so much like Arabella’s.

She wasn’t sure if this was right, but she needed someone close to Cassandra.

And aside from Nathaniel, Evelyn was her only option.

Nathaniel pressed his lips together, realizing Isabella’s plan.

"Evelyn, I need you to gain Cassandra’s trust. Stay close to her. If possible, plant a listening device in her room."

Isabella’s gaze darkened. "I want to know her every move."

Evelyn froze, gripping the hand warmer.

"I know it’s dangerous. Cassandra is Arabella’s mother. There’s risk involved."

"I’ll do it."

Evelyn’s eyes burned with resolve. "I’ve seen how Ms. Vanderbilt suffers. To Cassandra, only Genevieve matters. Arabella might as well be a servant. Only when Mr. Harrison or Mr. Alexander are around does she get treated like a lady."

Isabella’s throat tightened.

"I care for Ms. Vanderbilt, but I won’t excuse their cruelty. If not for Mr. Lockwood, I don’t know who else would truly help her."

The memory of Sebastian and Arabella, hands entwined, flashed in Isabella’s mind.

Arabella had found her safe harbor.

Where was hers?

"Ms. Sinclair, you’ve been good to her. I’ll help you, no matter what."

Isabella squeezed Evelyn’s hands. "Thank you. But be careful. If there’s any danger, contact me immediately. The mission can wait—your safety comes first."

Evelyn nodded fiercely.

Since the girl hadn’t eaten, Isabella cooked her a hearty bowl of pasta with meat and eggs, served with pickled vegetables Margaret had made. Simple, but made with care.

Evelyn devoured it, clearly starving.

"Good?" Isabella smiled.

"Yes! It’s amazing!"

Evelyn wiped her mouth. "Ms. Sinclair, you’re an incredible cook! Mr. Kingsley is lucky to have you!"

Isabella’s smile turned wry. "Too bad he doesn’t appreciate it. I’d rather be with someone who does."

Genevieve Vanderbilt had been beaten badly by Sebastian’s men. Too ashamed to face her family, she fled to Switzerland for reconstructive surgery.

Lillian was Sebastian’s girl—she wouldn’t have acted without his approval.

If Genevieve dared to complain, not only would she lose face, but she might provoke Sebastian’s wrath.

Trapped in that filthy cellar, surrounded by rats, enduring those brutal strikes—she never wanted to relive that nightmare.

But she wouldn’t let this go.

Never.

After surgery, Genevieve sneaked back to New York, her face still bandaged. The moment she got into her car, her phone rang.

"Where have you been? Why aren’t you answering?" Victoria Sterling’s imperious voice grated on her nerves.

"Victoria, watch your tone. I’m a Vanderbilt, not your servant!" Genevieve snapped, wincing as her face throbbed.

"Look at you! Last time, you humiliated me in front of Alexander. I haven’t even settled that score, and you dare snap at me?"

Victoria laughed mockingly. "Fine, I’ll forgive you. Tomorrow, I’m sending someone to pick you up. You’re coming with me to try on dresses for my engagement party."

"Engagement? What engagement?"

"My engagement to Alexander, of course!"

"What?!"

Genevieve’s blood ran cold. "Alexander would never agree to marry you unless he’s lost his mind!"

"He hasn’t agreed yet, but he will."

Victoria’s voice dripped with arrogance. "Just wait. He’ll surrender to me, and soon, I’ll be your sister-in-law."
###Chapter 361

Glynnis felt like she was negotiating with a deranged woman who'd made such outrageous demands.

Thaddeus was the formidable CEO of the Abernathy Group, a man whose influence eclipsed even Frederic's. What could the Fairhaven family possibly do against him?

But she didn't bother pointing that out. She'd rather sit back and watch them humiliate themselves, letting all of Elmsworth witness their idiocy.

"Sure, whatever makes you happy," Glynnis muttered, clutching her throbbing cheek. "Here's to a long and blissful marriage with Thad." Her congratulations dripped with sarcasm.

"By the way," Edith suddenly shifted the topic, "remember when you told me about Mr. Bartley's son? The one who was interested in you, but you turned him down?"

Glynnis stiffened.

She remembered.

Her mother, Elspeth, had dragged her to a golf course to meet the Bartleys, hoping to set her up with their son. But the Bartleys hadn't been impressed—instead, they'd wanted to meet her dim-witted sister. The humiliation still burned.

Later, to save face, she'd lied to Edith, claiming she'd rejected the Bartleys because she could do better.

"Why bring him up now?" Glynnis snapped.

"Oh, nothing much," Edith said, a smug smirk curling her lips. "Except he's currently pursuing me."

Glynnis scoffed. "You're about to become the Abernathy Group's CEO's wife. Why would you care about some mayor's son?"

"Of course, Thad is my only choice. So, I turned him down." Edith's grin widened, malice glinting in her eyes. "But he said he'd do anything for me. Anything."

Glynnis's stomach twisted. "What are you planning?"

"I want him to marry Mari."

Glynnis sucked in a sharp breath. The sheer audacity of the demand left her speechless.

The Fairhaven family had truly raised a monster.

"You're Mari's sister," Edith continued smoothly, her voice laced with cunning. "There are things I can't do alone. I need your help to make this marriage happen."

She leaned in, her tone dripping with poison. "My family is powerful. If Mari marries into an ordinary family, my brother won't give up on her. But if she marries into the Bartleys? His hopes will be crushed forever."

The cruelty of the scheme sent a chill down Glynnis's spine.

"I still remember how you 'helped' me last time," Glynnis hissed, her face throbbing with pain. "You nearly got me arrested. And now you want my help again? Why should I?"

Edith smirked. "Because I'm about to be your sister-in-law. Shouldn't we maintain a good relationship?"

She tilted her head, feigning innocence. "Besides, Mari stole the man you love. Don't you want revenge? Who else can help you but me?"

Glynnis's fists clenched.

She remembered Jareth's brutal beating, the humiliation, the pain.

Her heart burned with hatred.

"Fine," she spat. "What do you want?"

Meanwhile, chaos reigned in the Chambers family.

Two nights ago, during a storm, Byron had been in a horrific car accident.

The driver died instantly. The bodyguard in the passenger seat was barely clinging to life.

Byron, seated in the back, had survived—but with a severe head injury, glass embedded in his face, and his legs crushed beyond repair.

Jeff had consulted every top surgeon in the country. None could restore his son's ability to walk.

Now, the family sat in the living room, shrouded in gloom.

Margaret wept dramatically, dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief. "How could this happen? He drove that road every day! Why now?"

Avery, lounging elegantly on the sofa, sipped his tea. "Just because a road is familiar doesn't mean accidents can't happen."

Margaret shot him a venomous glare. "You seem awfully pleased about this."

"Pleased? No." Avery adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses. "I'm just not hysterical like you, mourning someone who isn't even dead."

"Enough!" Jeff slammed his hand on the armrest. "Byron is suffering, and all you do is argue? If you can't help, at least don't make things worse!"

Margaret fell silent, seething.

Avery set down his tea. "Actually, Father, I might have a solution."

Jeff's eyes lit up. "Speak."

"Evadne has a secret identity—she's a renowned surgeon. She once performed a complex craniotomy on Thaddeus. In medical circles, she's known as 'Dr. Eve.'"

Matthew's head snapped up, his gaze sharpening.

Jeff's jaw dropped. "Evadne? A surgeon?"

Avery nodded. "She's brilliant but humble. If anyone can help Byron, it's her."

Jeff's expression shifted from shock to hope. "Then we'll go to Skyrim tomorrow. You'll accompany me to personally request her help."

"Of course."

Jeff clasped Avery's shoulder, his voice softening. "You've always been close to her. She'll listen to you, won't she?"

Avery smiled modestly. "Evadne has a kind heart. She'd help regardless."

Jeff beamed, his approval of Avery growing.

Matthew watched, his teeth grinding.

Later, in the hallway, Matthew cornered Avery.

"Your act is impressive," he sneered. "Gaining favor while playing innocent."

Avery yawned. "It's late. I'm going to bed."

"Byron's accident was your doing, wasn't it?" Matthew hissed. "You sabotaged his car—not to kill him, but to cripple him."

Avery adjusted his glasses, then burst into laughter.

The sound echoed eerily through the empty hall.

"Matthew, with that imagination, you should've been a novelist instead of a CEO." He wiped a tear from his eye. "If you insist I'm responsible, then I must be his bad luck charm."

With that, he strolled away, leaving Matthew fuming.

Back in his room, Avery poured himself a glass of wine, satisfaction curling his lips.

Sometimes, making someone suffer was far more rewarding than killing them.

A knock. His assistant, Harvey, entered.

"It's done," Harvey murmured. "The driver took full responsibility. He won't talk."

"Good." Avery swirled his wine. "Tomorrow, Jeff and I will visit Evadne. We'll ask her to 'save' Byron."

Harvey frowned. "But what if she actually cures him?"

Avery smirked. "She's a doctor, not a miracle worker."

Byron's legs were beyond repair—by his own design.

"This way," Avery mused, "Jeff will see me as the devoted son who risked everything to help. Even if it fails, he'll be grateful."

Harvey's eyes widened in understanding.

Avery gazed out the window, his reflection dark against the glass.

"Even if Byron was his favorite, what does it matter now?" He took a slow sip. "Emeric would never let his precious daughter marry a cripple. In the end, I'll be Jeff's only hope."
###Chapter 362

Jefferson was desperate to save his son.

He had confirmed with Edmund over the phone that he and Evangeline were at home. So, the next day, he would visit the Ashbourne family in Skyrim, along with Adrian.

"Edmund! Edmund! You have to help your nephew this time!"

Jefferson burst through the entrance, his voice thick with urgency, his usual composed demeanor shattered in front of his longtime friend.

Edmund and Sylvia rushed out to greet them.

Seeing Jefferson’s disheveled appearance and the deep lines of stress etched into his face, Edmund couldn’t help but smirk inwardly.

Finally, this man, who had spent years competing with him in looks, was showing his age.

"Mr. Chambers, what in the world happened?" Sylvia asked, startled by his frantic state.

Jefferson, in his haste, tripped over a loose stone and tumbled right at Edmund and Sylvia’s feet.

They could only watch in stunned silence as he groaned, clutching his ankle.

"Dad! Are you all right?" Adrian rushed to help him up, barely suppressing a laugh.

Jefferson’s devotion to his son was undeniable.

Without bothering to regain his dignity, Jefferson grabbed Edmund’s arm. "Edmund, Brandon was in a terrible car accident a few days ago!"

Edmund and Sylvia gasped. "What happened?"

"It was a rainy night. He was driving home. The roads were slippery, visibility was low. A massive truck was speeding and slammed into his car."

Adrian, steadying his father, added grimly, "His legs were crushed. The bones are shattered. The doctors say they might have to amputate."

"Amputate?!" Edmund was stunned.

"You’ve watched Brandon grow up. You can’t just let him become a cripple, can you?"

Jefferson’s eyes burned with desperation. "Adrian told me Evangeline is a brilliant surgeon. Can she help Brandon?"

"Mr. Chambers."

Just then, Evangeline’s elegant figure appeared in the doorway.

Bathed in the morning light, her flawless face was breathtaking. She had clearly just woken up, her eyes still slightly drowsy. Her freshly washed hair glistened with droplets of water, her makeup-free skin glowing with a natural flush.

Adrian’s gaze locked onto her, his throat tightening.

It was dangerous to meet someone so beautiful when you were young. For fifteen years, he had carried nothing but longing for her—an unfulfilled ache.

"Evangeline, please! You have to save Brandon!" Jefferson rushed forward, seizing her hands, his voice breaking.

"I heard most of what you said earlier."

Evangeline’s tone was gentle but firm. "I’m a doctor. Saving lives is my duty. Since Brandon is your son, I won’t refuse."

She didn’t know Brandon well, but given her father’s friendship with Jefferson, she couldn’t turn away.

"Thank you. Thank you, Evangeline!" Jefferson’s shoulders sagged in relief.

"But, Mr. Chambers, I need to be clear. I’m just a surgeon, not a miracle worker. I’ll need to examine Brandon myself before giving you an answer."

"Evangeline, if anyone can save him, it’s you! Adrian told me about the brain surgery you performed on Thaddeus!" Jefferson insisted.

Evangeline sighed. "That was neurosurgery."

"If you can operate on a brain, then fixing Brandon’s legs should be nothing for you!"

Evangeline pressed her lips together, her eyes flickering to Adrian’s.

He gave her a soft smile, warmth in his gaze.

"Fine. I’ll do my best."

That afternoon, Evangeline, Jefferson, and Adrian returned to Elmsworth.

To the Chambers family, Evangeline was a godsend. They treated her with the utmost respect and hospitality.

But Evangeline, focused solely on saving Brandon, brushed aside all formalities and went straight to his hospital room.

At that moment, Brandon was still unconscious. He should have woken by now, but the doctors had increased his sedation—afraid he wouldn’t be able to handle the truth about his condition.

An hour later, Evangeline emerged with the hospital’s chief surgeon and two professors, their expressions grave.

"Evangeline, how is Brandon?" Jefferson rushed to her.

The rest of the Chambers family, along with secretaries and bodyguards, crowded around.

Evangeline’s delicate brows furrowed. After a long pause, she spoke quietly. "Mr. Chambers, Brandon’s condition is severe. The fractures are extensive. Even with metal pins, reconstruction is unlikely. The damage is too great. The chance of him ever walking again is less than twenty percent."

The room erupted in gasps.

Jefferson swayed, needing Matthew and Bertha to hold him up.

Only Adrian remained in the corner, unnoticed, his gold-rimmed glasses reflecting a cold light, a faint smirk playing on his lips.

"Ms. Ashbourne! Even if there’s only a one percent chance, please save my brother!" Matthew begged, desperation in his eyes.

"Of course. Since I’m here, I’ll do everything I can."

Evangeline hesitated, her gaze flickering.

Jefferson noticed. "Evangeline, if there’s something else, just say it!"

"Mr. Chambers… are you sure Brandon’s injuries were from a car accident?"

The question sent a ripple of shock through the room.

Only two people remained unreadable—Matthew and Adrian.

"What do you mean?" Jefferson demanded.

"In my career, I’ve treated countless fractures. Based on the injury patterns, I can usually tell what caused them. This… doesn’t look like a car accident. There are signs of blunt force trauma—possibly from something like an iron rod."

A collective gasp filled the air.

"Ms. Ashbourne, are you saying someone attacked my brother after the accident?"

Matthew shot a glance at Adrian, feigning concern. "Does this mean the accident was staged?"

Staged?!

The room erupted in murmurs.

"Dad! I told you there was something suspicious about this!" Bertha cried.

Jefferson’s face darkened.

"I can’t confirm if it was staged. I’m just stating my medical findings. The amputation surgery will take time, Mr. Chambers. You should rest. Maybe at the Grand Marquis Hotel. I’ll update you when it’s over."

"I’m not leaving! I’ll wait here!"

Jefferson couldn’t help but admire his future daughter-in-law.

He was determined to make her part of the Chambers family.

The surgery dragged on—starting at one in the afternoon and ending at nine at night.

Finally, the operating room lights dimmed.

Evangeline, leaning heavily on an assistant, emerged. Her surgical gown was drenched in sweat, her legs trembling from hours of standing.

"Evangeline!"

Adrian was the first to reach her, his hand steadying her shaking body. "You must be exhausted."

"I’m fine. The surgery was what mattered."

Suddenly, dizziness hit her. She swayed, her vision blurring.

"Evangeline, careful!" Adrian tightened his grip around her waist, pulling her close.

The Chambers family exchanged knowing glances.

The Ashbourne heiress seemed awfully close to Adrian. Maybe there was something between them.

But given Adrian’s standing in the family, he wasn’t exactly a suitable match.

"I’m okay." Evangeline steadied herself, gently pushing him away.

She didn’t want rumors, not under everyone’s watchful eyes.

Adrian’s hands clenched at his sides.

Jefferson rushed over. "Evangeline, how is he?"

"I did everything I could."

She wiped her forehead, breathing deeply. "Brandon’s left leg was too damaged. I managed to save it, but..."

"And his right leg?"

"It had to be amputated."

The word hit Jefferson like a hammer.

"That’s… that’s all right. You saved one leg. That’s more than we hoped for."

"Also, Brandon woke briefly near the end. He said someone deliberately broke his legs."

Jefferson paled. "Who? Who did it?"

"You’ll have to ask him when he’s stable."

Thanks to Evangeline’s skill, the surgery was a success—saving one leg was nothing short of a miracle.

Brandon was moved to recovery, and the Chambers family crowded around him.

Only Adrian stayed behind, sitting with Evangeline on a bench, handing her a steaming cup of coffee.

"Here. You must be exhausted."

"Thanks." She took it, her tired eyes meeting his.

"I should be thanking you. Even if he never walks properly again, it’s better than losing both legs."

"Adrian."

She hesitated, then asked quietly, "Was it you?"

His heart skipped. "What?"

"Never mind."

She didn’t press further, standing slowly. "I need to eat. I’m starving."

"I’ll come with you."

He stood too, not wanting her to go alone.

Suddenly, Evangeline swayed, her vision swimming.

She hadn’t eaten all day. Hypoglycemia hit hard.

Adrian caught her just as she collapsed, his arms locking around her slender frame.

"Evangeline."

"Vanessa?!"

A familiar voice cut through the haze. Evangeline turned weakly.

Her heart stopped.

Hamilton sat in a wheelchair, staring at her in shock.

And behind him, tall and imposing, his gaze icy—

Thaddeus.
###Chapter 363

The corridor plunged into an eerie stillness.

Alexander watched as Isabella cradled Evelyn, her delicate frame nestled against him like a fragile bird seeking shelter. The sight drove a dagger through his heart, bringing an unexpected sting to his eyes.

In his absence, they'd grown alarmingly close.

The more Alexander dwelled on it, the more bitterness seeped into his veins. He lowered his gaze, refusing to look at Evelyn. The blue veins on his hands stood out starkly as they gripped the wheelchair's armrest.

"Evelyn, you just completed a major surgery. You're exhausted and need immediate rest."

Avery knew the Kingsley family stood nearby, but he didn't flinch. His entire focus remained on Evelyn, his gaze soft with concern. "I'll take you home."

"Grandfather Kingsley!"

Yet Evelyn ignored Avery's tender offer, her concern solely for Reginald. She knelt before him, taking his weathered hands in hers. "Grandfather Kingsley, why are you at the hospital? Are you unwell?"

Alexander pressed his lips together, bitterness coating his tongue.

She acted as though he, a grown man, were invisible—selectively blind.

Apparently only Avery existed in her world now.

"Child, I'm fine. Just an old heart condition acting up. Alexander insisted we come for a checkup." Reginald's expression remained fond when looking at Evelyn.

"Grandfather Kingsley, you mustn't neglect your health. Promise me you'll get regular checkups," Evelyn urged, concern evident in her voice.

"Evelyn, who is this gentleman?" Reginald's gaze shifted to Avery with a speculative gleam.

"Mr. Kingsley, I'm Avery Lockwood." Avery stepped forward with a polite bow.

"Ah, I remember now—from Margaret's birthday gala. Mr. Lockwood's youngest son." Reginald nodded approvingly. "A fine young man."

Despite his words, discomfort prickled at seeing Evelyn and Avery's closeness.

The atmosphere between the former couple crackled with tension, more strained than during their initial separation.

What could he do?

Just as Reginald prepared to pull Evelyn aside, a shrill voice shattered the silence.

"Grandfather Kingsley! How are you feeling?"

Evelyn looked up coldly to see Victoria, clad in a nightgown, rushing toward them. Two bodyguards trailed at a discreet distance. At the sight of Victoria, Reginald's lips thinned as he shot Alexander a pointed glance.

Alexander's expression darkened, his icy gaze landing on Victoria. "What are you doing here?"

"I heard Grandfather Kingsley was ill. I couldn't sleep, so I came without telling Mother."

Victoria's delicate face flushed, her curls disheveled. Her nightgown and slippers betrayed her haste and concern for Reginald's health.

"You must be Nathaniel's sister?" Reginald asked, an ambiguous glint in his eyes.

"Yes, I'm Victoria." Her hands twisted nervously, cheeks deepening to crimson.

Knowing this marked her first formal meeting with Reginald—and her impending entry into the Kingsley family—her attire now seemed woefully inappropriate.

"Just call me Victoria."

She bent forward earnestly. "Tonight, Alex and I will stay by your side. If you're hospitalized, I'll remain with you as long as needed!"

Alexander's frown deepened, his expression visibly darkening.

Evelyn caught his reaction. Unlike typical CEOs, Alexander wore displeasure openly. His business success stemmed from ruthless strategy, not emotional intelligence.

When they'd first married, he'd worn that same sour expression around her.

So—was he displeased with Victoria?

Evelyn averted her gaze, refusing him another glance.

After all, despite his current displeasure, he'd certainly been delighted knocking on Victoria's hotel door that night.

"Ms. Sterling, I've already been examined. It's minor, and I can leave now."

Reginald called Nathaniel affectionately by name but addressed Victoria formally as Ms. Sterling. His lack of warmth was palpable. "Ms. Sterling, if you stay at the hospital with me, it's as if you're hoping I won't be discharged."

His words held jest—but to Victoria, they struck like a slap.

Long ago, she'd heard Margaret complain about Reginald—how he couldn't distinguish friend from foe. He doted on Evelyn while neglecting his own granddaughter Margaret. Not only had he opposed Evelyn and Alexander's divorce, but he'd gifted Evelyn the family heirloom jade bracelet upon their separation!

Fortunately, Arabella had smashed it in a rage before leaving.

At least she'd accomplished one good deed.

"No, Grandfather Kingsley, that's not what I meant—" Flustered, Victoria turned pleading eyes to Alexander.

But Alexander ignored her silent signals completely.

"Ms. Sterling, I appreciate your concern, but Alexander and Ms. Sinclair are with me. That suffices. It's late, and unsafe for you to be out. Your bodyguards will escort you home." Reginald's tone remained mild, unwilling to make a scene with a young girl.

Yet Victoria's face paled with humiliation.

She'd been dismissed by this old man, with no offer from Alexander to see her home. The message was clear: leave as you came.

How dare they!

Once she officially joined the Kingsley family—once that old man was confined to a dementia nursing home—she'd bribe the staff to torment him, withholding meals and forcing him to drink bathwater!

"Evelyn, come here!" Reginald's expression shifted instantly, beckoning Evelyn with a grin while ignoring Victoria.

"Yes, Grandfather Kingsley."

Though resisting Alexander internally, Evelyn wouldn't upset Reginald. She moved toward him obediently.

Seeing this formidable woman take timid, delicate steps before her grandfather—presenting such vulnerability—yanked Alexander's thoughts back three years, to when she'd first become his wife.

Deep inside, something tender stirred silently.

Truthfully, he adored every version of her—but back then, he hadn't understood his own feelings, nor how to express them.

But what did it matter now?

Behind Alexander's profound gaze, his scrutinizing eyes held only distress and sorrow as they rested on Evelyn.

"Evelyn, come home with Alexander and me tonight. Stay at Kingsley Manor."

Reginald stroked Evelyn's hair gently. Fearing refusal, he added quickly, "The house is spacious—plenty of rooms. You can stay beside mine. Tomorrow, I'll have Alexander cook for you. Tonight, he'll prepare your foot bath! Rest for days while he does all the work!"

Alexander's lips pressed together, his brow twitching.

Preparing a foot bath? Fine.

But cooking?

"Grandfather Kingsley..." Evelyn hesitated, eyes flickering.

Just as she formed her reply, Avery stepped forward leisurely, an elegant smile playing on his lips. "Mr. Kingsley, I'm afraid Evelyn can't accompany you tonight."

"Why?" Reginald frowned.

Avery sighed deeply, his gaze warm with concern as it lingered on Evelyn's weary face. "Evelyn just performed major surgery for my brother today. She stood nearly ten hours. After the operation, she was completely drained—almost fainted."

"What?" Reginald started, leaning forward instantly.

Alexander stiffened, his heart clenching.

Unreasonable. Unbelievable. A tumult of emotions left his gaze perplexed.

She'd performed major surgery? No wonder she looked so exhausted—her complexion almost ill.

Alexander's jaw tightened, lips parting slightly.

He wanted to speak—but the words lodged in his throat.

What was he resisting? Hesitating over?

"So I'm taking Evelyn home now. My house is right behind hers—very convenient."

Avery's arm hovered near Evelyn's shoulder without touching her, demonstrating gentlemanly decorum before the Kingsleys. "Mr. Kingsley, I know you care for Evelyn. But she and Mr. Kingsley are divorced. Having her stay under the same roof with him—as an outsider, I find it inappropriate. If you truly care for Evelyn, consider her feelings."

The statement, neither humble nor pushy, remained calm—yet it ignited fury in Reginald's heart. Even Alexander's icy gaze burned with anger.

How dare he speak so audaciously!

Alexander's brows furrowed, poised to retort—when Evelyn interjected calmly, "Avery, Grandfather Kingsley is family. Everything he does is for my benefit. Such words are better left unsaid."

TL©´- TH

"My goodness, Mr. Kingsley! What a coincidence meeting you here!"

All turned to see Jeffrey approaching hastily with his secretary.

Evelyn couldn't help her surprise.

Truly a tycoon—just moments ago weeping over his son's condition, now chatting amiably and composed before rivals.

Understandable. The Kingsleys and Lockwoods had been business rivals for years. Jeffrey wouldn't show weakness before competitors.

"Jeffrey, I heard about your son's condition. Is everything alright?" Reginald asked with concern.

"Byron had a car accident. Initially, the prognosis wasn't promising—"

Jeffrey then looked gratefully at Evelyn. "But Evelyn saved him with her remarkable skills! Others may fail to appreciate Evelyn's worth, but to the Lockwoods, she's a treasure—someone we value deeply! Nathaniel and I are like brothers. Naturally, I treat Evelyn as my own daughter!"

The insinuation hung heavy in the air.

Jeffrey had long known Evelyn was divorced—her ex-husband being Alexander.

He'd previously voiced outrage, claiming she deserved better.

Marrying into the Kingsley family was bad enough—but wedding the illegitimate son? Even his own son Avery surpassed Alexander.

"Mr. Lockwood, are you thirsty? Let me take you for tea." Evelyn, uncomfortable, attempted to redirect.

But Jeffrey missed the hint entirely. "Evelyn, I'm not thirsty! I haven't finished praising you yet!"

Victoria seethed, teeth grinding.

Why did every elite in Elmsworth favor this wretch? Were other women extinct?

Alexander's frosty gaze rested on Evelyn, his heart aching as much as his eyes were cold.

"You seem fond of daughters. One isn't enough—you must acquire goddaughters too."

Reginald caught Jeffrey's jab. "I'm different. I want only one granddaughter-in-law. And only Evelyn will do."

Avery smiled, but his hand behind Evelyn's back clenched in hidden frustration.

Humiliation and shame washed over Victoria, tearing at her heart.

She regretted coming. She should've stayed home, letting her grandfather and mother scheme her way into the Kingsley family.

Every independent attempt ended in humiliation!

Jeffrey paused mid-sentence when Alexander's cold, clear voice cut through.

"Grandfather Kingsley, Ms. Sinclair and I divorced over half a year ago. Ms. Sinclair has chosen someone else. It's unfair to force her."

The hallway fell silent.

Evelyn's heart contracted sharply—but only momentarily. Her lips curled in resignation.

Why regret? This wasn't the first time Alexander had let her go.

All men's promises were false. What man could chase a woman forever? Love her eternally?

Not even Nathaniel, so principled, had managed it.

Never mind. Her tycoon father's love life was a joke.

"What nonsense are you spouting, boy!" Reginald glared at his grandson, teeth gritted.

Were they alone, he'd have slapped him.

"Seems Mr. Kingsley has moved on. If both parties have, isn't that the best outcome?" Avery asked lightly, a smile playing on his lips.
###Chapter 364

Isabella was finally escorted home by Nathaniel, thanks to Julian's intervention.

Theodore pushed Reginald's wheelchair toward the parking lot, with Vanessa trailing behind him like an unwanted shadow.

"When are you going to stop following me?" Theodore suddenly stopped, his voice cold.

Vanessa nearly collided with him, stumbling awkwardly.

"I just want to help you take Grandpa Reginald home, Theo," she said with a pitiful expression. "He just got discharged. He'll need assistance—"

"Assistance? What can you do?" Theodore scoffed, cutting her off.

"I've seen how your mother and brother coddled you. You've never lifted a finger in your life. What help could you possibly offer?" His tone was merciless.

"Theo—"

"You know who Grandpa Reginald really wants." His eyes softened at the thought of Isabella. "Go back and focus on your own family."

With that, he wheeled Reginald away, leaving Vanessa flustered and humiliated.

On the drive home, their chauffeur took the wheel. Mr. Bennett sat in the passenger seat while Theodore and Reginald occupied the back.

The car was warm, but Reginald's icy expression made it feel like a freezer.

Theodore knew he was furious.

But the truth was, he and Isabella were divorced. Their irreconcilable differences were undeniable.

Theodore had fought for her, risked everything—yet it still wasn't enough to earn her trust.

He wasn't afraid of loving her unconditionally. What terrified him was that she had never truly trusted him.

When they arrived at Kingsley Manor, Theodore stepped out to help Mr. Bennett with the wheelchair, intending to assist Reginald.

"I don't need that damn thing. I'm not an invalid," Reginald snapped, shoving Theodore aside. "Mr. Bennett, fetch my cane."

Within moments, the cane was in his hand.

Reginald's lips pressed into a thin line. Without warning, he swung the cane hard against Theodore's back.

A sharp crack echoed. Theodore winced, his jaw tightening.

"Useless boy! What good are you? You might as well be dead!" Reginald roared, striking him again. "Isabella is a gem! You were finally making progress, and then you ruined it! Are you out of your mind?"

Theodore took the blows in silence, his handsome face shadowed with guilt under the moonlight.

"Are you blind? Can't you see how much that Chambers boy cares for her? How close they've become? How Julian wants her as his daughter-in-law?"

Reginald's voice trembled with rage. "Even if you're innocent, you should've fought for her! Proved your loyalty! Held onto her no matter what!"

Could he do that?

Could he stand by and watch her with Nathaniel without losing control?

"Grandpa, I said what I said. I did what I did." Theodore clenched his fists, his eyes glistening. "Hit me if you must. But when you're done, please... let Isabella and me go."

"Let go? So you can marry that Sterling girl?" Reginald nearly collapsed if not for Mr. Bennett's support.

"Do I have to remarry? One marriage was enough. I don't care about weddings. I don't even like kids."

The words twisted like a knife in his own chest.

He did like children. But if he couldn't have them with the woman he loved, they meant nothing.

He wouldn't promise to love them fully. That wouldn't be fair.

"Why should I let go of such a remarkable girl? Unless I'm dead, she'll always be part of this family—my future granddaughter!"

Reginald struck the ground with his cane. "To you, she might just be the woman you love. But to me? She's the child who saved my life! Two years ago, on Christmas Eve, if not for her—if she hadn't gotten me to the hospital in time—I wouldn't be here!"

Theodore's expression darkened. "I know, Grandpa. The car accident was severe. Without Isabella—"

"You only know she took me to the hospital. But do you know how badly she was hurt?"

Reginald's voice cracked, tears streaking his face. "I was unconscious. You were all overseas. Only Isabella and Mr. Bennett were there. She was covered in blood, but she made him swear not to tell us. She didn't want us to worry!"

Theodore's breath hitched.

The revelation felt like a blade twisting in his chest, shredding his heart.

Mr. Bennett lowered his gaze, sorrow etched into his features. The secret weighed heavily on him, but he was bound by professionalism—and Isabella's request.

"Grandpa, is this true?" Theodore's voice was hollow.

"Why would I lie now?"

Reginald's emotions overwhelmed him. He collapsed into his wheelchair. "What she sacrificed for you—what she endured—you can never repay her. Even if she spends a lifetime resenting you, you deserve it!"

With that, he wheeled himself away, leaving Theodore frozen in the chilling silence.

"Mr. Kingsley, let me help you inside," Mr. Bennett urged anxiously.

"No! I don't want to see anyone right now!"

The air turned frigid, suffocating Theodore.

"Mr. Bennett, as you can see, Grandpa doesn't want me here." Theodore swallowed hard, his voice rough. "I'll stay at a hotel nearby. If anything happens, call me immediately. I won't upset him further."

"Mr. Kingsley, wait!" Mr. Bennett called, unease in his eyes.

"What is it?"

"Is there really no hope for you and Ms. Sinclair?"

Theodore's chest ached. "I don't know."

"There are things about Ms. Sinclair you still don't know." Mr. Bennett clenched his fists, struggling.

Theodore turned slowly. "What things?"

"She made me promise never to tell." Mr. Bennett looked torn. "But I hope one day, she'll tell you herself."

The words ignited Theodore's curiosity.

Isabella had hidden her identity as the Sinclair heiress, married him, loved him for thirteen years—those secrets alone had shattered him.

What else was she keeping from him?

Could it be even more unbelievable?

Two days after the amputation, Byron finally woke.

Isabella arrived early that morning. She hadn't just performed the surgery and left—Julian had asked for her help, and she felt obligated to oversee Byron's recovery.

In the hospital room, Isabella and two attending physicians examined Byron's reattached left leg. His right had been replaced with a prosthetic.

"My leg..."

Byron's face was ghostly pale. "I'm ruined. My life is over."

"Byron, stay calm." Isabella's voice was steady behind her mask, only her striking eyes visible. "You saved one leg. That's more than many can say."

"Someone tried to kill me. Nathaniel tried to kill me!" Byron suddenly grabbed her wrist, his grip frantic.

Isabella stiffened, glancing at the other doctors.

Luckily, they were across the room and hadn't heard his slurred words.

She dismissed them, shut the door, and faced Byron. "You mentioned this under anesthesia. Do you have proof?"

Byron trembled violently, as if reliving a nightmare.

"After the crash, the driver died instantly. My secretary was still alive. I was trapped—but my legs weren't broken. I could move them."

Isabella's brow furrowed. "And then?"

"Then... a black car pulled up. A man got out—wearing a mask and cap. But I recognized his build, his eyes. It was Nathaniel."

Byron's pupils dilated with terror. "He walked over... had a metal rod. He killed my secretary right in front of me."

Isabella's pulse spiked.

"Then he raised the rod—and smashed my leg! I screamed... then everything went black."
###Chapter 365

Isabella Sinclair stood frozen, her mind reeling from the shocking revelation.

Could Alexander Kingsley, with his polished manners and refined demeanor, truly be capable of such brutality? It seemed implausible that he would dirty his own hands when he had countless others who could handle Byron Prescott for him.

She steadied herself, her voice firm. "Byron, these are serious accusations. We need concrete evidence. You should take this to Mr. Chambers and the authorities, not me."

"Miss Sinclair, you saved my life. You're my savior!" Byron's eyes burned with desperate sincerity. "I can't just stand by and watch you walk into his trap! I know Alexander has been pursuing you, spending time with you. I don’t want you deceived by his act. That man has been a monster since childhood! His gentlemanly facade is just that—a mask. Underneath, he’s nothing but a wolf in sheep’s clothing! He’s only after you for the Sinclair family’s influence. He doesn’t care about you!"

Even if Alexander wasn’t a saint, Byron was no better. The incident at the equestrian club had been his own doing.

Of course, he knew Alexander had retaliated on Isabella’s behalf, taking sadistic pleasure in personally making him suffer.

Now, with his condition and any chance of marrying Isabella gone, he was determined to expose Alexander’s true nature. If he couldn’t have her, no one would.

Stepping out of the hospital room, Isabella’s expression was pensive.

The Chambers family members hovered by the door, questioning her about Byron’s state. She answered mechanically, her thoughts elsewhere.

That was when she spotted Alexander, leaning casually against the wall in the corner.

She bit her lip and strode toward him.

"Isabella, you’ve had a long day." Alexander straightened instantly, his warm smile softening his sharp features.

Nothing about him resembled the monster Byron had described.

"Alex, we need to talk." Her tone was calm, but her eyes were serious.

"Of course."

As they walked away together, Jeff Chambers nodded approvingly.

"Matthew, don’t you think Alexander and Isabella make a perfect match?"

Matthew lowered his voice. "Are you really giving up on Byron?"

"Given the circumstances, do you honestly think Isabella would still marry him?" Jeff watched Alexander’s retreating figure thoughtfully. "Alexander and Isabella share a childhood bond. Their feelings for each other are undeniable. If they end up together, it wouldn’t be the worst outcome. I may not favor Alexander, but he is still my son."

Matthew’s expression darkened.

Across from the hospital, in a secluded café booth, the two sat facing each other. Alexander, ever attentive, ordered Isabella’s favorite strawberry tart, sensing she might be hungry after the morning’s chaos.

"Eat. You’ve always had a healthy appetite, and you love strawberries."

"Alex, do you consider me a friend?" she interrupted abruptly.

His lashes flickered. "Of course. Aside from my mother, you are the person I value most in this world."

"Then I need you to be honest with me." She took a deep breath. "Did you have anything to do with what happened to your brother?"

"Did Byron tell you that?" Alexander’s hand stilled around his coffee cup.

"I have my reasons for asking."

"If I said no, would you believe me?"

He lifted his gaze slowly, his eyes glistening with hurt. "You’re asking because you doubt me. You’re questioning my integrity. Am I less trustworthy than Byron in your eyes?"

Isabella stared at him, stunned.

For a fleeting moment, she thought of Nathaniel Hawthorne.

That man had once demanded, almost desperately, why she couldn’t trust him.

"Byron lost a leg. He wouldn’t go this far just to frame you."

"Byron was Matthew’s pawn. He’s made countless enemies in Elmsworth. Plenty of people would want him dead." Alexander’s jaw tightened. "Besides, he deserved it."

Then, he recounted everything that had transpired at the equestrian club.

"It was Byron who orchestrated it all."

Isabella watched him silently.

"Alexander, I’ve never cared about the Chambers family. If I wanted revenge, I wouldn’t resort to something so crude. It’s beneath me." He straightened, sipping his coffee with effortless elegance.

For fifteen years, he and his mother had fought to survive in Helgen, their consciences long abandoned, their lies more convincing than the truth.

Even to the woman he loved, he lied instinctively, again and again.

Some lies were necessary.

To Isabella, he believed his lies were justified. In a way, they were his twisted form of love.

Isabella’s piercing gaze made even him, hardened by years of deception, falter.

"Alex, I value honesty, integrity, and kindness. I’m not accusing you. I just hope that no matter what happens, you’ll always hold onto the pure, kind-hearted boy I once knew."

Alexander’s fingers twitched against the table, his heart crumpling like paper.

He forced a weak smile, stabbing a piece of cake and shoving it into his mouth, chewing aggressively.

Just like his love for her, irreversible.

Some things could never be undone.

After parting from Alexander, Isabella felt emotionally drained.

Just then, Sebastian Sinclair called, and she answered immediately.

"Sebastian."

"Isabella, Oliver has secured what you wanted." His voice held a hint of amusement.

"What? What is it?" She frowned in confusion.

"Chasel Bright."

Isabella nearly choked.

"Oliver went to great lengths to bring him back to Elmsworth. Make sure you thank him properly when you see him tonight."

"Oliver’s coming back tonight? That’s wonderful! I’ve missed him so much!" Her voice cracked with emotion.

Ever perceptive, Sebastian caught her vulnerability. "I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have spoiled his surprise. I was just... excited."

"Sebastian, I don’t need surprises. I just want my family close."

But she knew that was easier said than done.

"Isabella, are you still at the hospital? With Byron?"

"Yes."

"I’ll pick you up."

"That’s not necessary. I can’t leave yet."

"It’s not just my decision. Father insists." His tone darkened. "He said you’ve done enough for Byron. There’s no need to push yourself further. Besides, the Chambers household is chaos right now. Even though we’re close, it’s best we keep our distance. Father wants me to bring you home."

Isabella’s brow furrowed.

She’d interacted extensively with the Abernathy family because of Nathaniel and his grandfather, clashing with Elspeth and her daughter. Yet Emeric had never erected such barriers before.

Her father’s disdain for the Chambers family ran deeper than she’d realized.

"I understand, Sebastian. You don’t need to come. I’ll drive back myself."

As night fell over Skyrim...

A sleek Maserati sped through the back gates of Silverlake Harbor, executing a sharp drift before parking in the courtyard.

It had been six months.

Oliver Sinclair stepped out and sprinted toward Sebastian.

"Sebastian! I missed you!"

"Me too."

They clasped hands in their usual默契 greeting. Sebastian glanced at the tinted car window. "Is Mr. Bright inside?"

"Yeah." Oliver smirked. "He’s... not very cooperative."

"Even the most stubborn tend to behave around you."

Sebastian’s gentle eyes flickered with concern. "You didn’t hurt him, did you?"

"Physically? No. Mentally? Maybe."

Oliver suddenly grimaced. "Damn! I need to pee! Be right back!"

Before Sebastian could respond, he was already sprinting away.

Sebastian shook his head, amused. "What has he been doing all these years? His bladder’s gotten worse."

A moment later...

Sebastian noticed the car rocking slightly before going still.

Curious, he approached cautiously.

As he neared, the occupant seemed to sense his presence, struggling more violently.

Sebastian narrowed his eyes and yanked the door open.

The next second, he froze.

There, bound and gagged in the back seat, was a strikingly handsome man, his furious protests muffled by the tape.

Angry. Pitiful.

This was Chasel?

Sebastian was stunned, quickly leaning in to rip the tape off.

Chasel gasped, his flawless face damp with sweat, his lips red and slightly swollen.

Even in distress, he was breathtakingly beautiful—more so than most women.

But what caught Sebastian’s attention were his eyes—wide, frightened, and glistening with unshed tears. In their depths, Sebastian saw a familiar innocence that always unsettled him, no matter how much time passed.

Their gazes locked, and for a moment, time stood still.

"Hey! That hurt, you know!" Chasel snapped, though his eyes never left Sebastian’s.

"My apologies." Sebastian’s tone was sincere.

"Untie me now!"

Chasel kicked his bound legs. "I’m losing circulation! I’ll die!"

"I can’t."

"What?!"

"I’ll wait for Oliver to release you."

Sebastian’s lips curved slightly. "If you run, I doubt I could catch you. After all, it’s better for the doer to undo what he’s done."
###Chapter 366

Chasel's fox-like eyes, red-rimmed and glistening, widened in shock.

What the hell was this man saying?

If not for his striking features, Chasel would've sworn he was facing a demon.

"Are you one of them? Some kind of kidnapper?!" Chasel's voice shook with fury.

"Mr. Bright, welcome to Elmsworth."

Cassius tilted his head slightly, extending a hand with effortless grace. "Cassius Ashbourne, CEO of K Group. A pleasure."

"K Group?" Chasel froze. "Wait—my aunt—are you—?"

"Exactly what you're thinking."

Cassius flexed his fingers, an awkward chuckle escaping him. "Let's shake hands once Elvis unties you."

"Cassius!"

Elvis stormed back, muttering curses. "That damn bathroom was miles away. Nearly pissed myself. What’s the point of a house this big?" Cassius arched a brow, torn between amusement and exasperation.

No matter how grand the Ashbourne estate was, to Elvis, it was just a gilded cage. Both he and Evadne were wild spirits, chafing under restraint.

The thought made Cassius’ chest tighten. Evadne’s three-year marriage to Thaddeus must have felt like a life sentence.

Chasel’s face twisted in disgust at the sight of Elvis.

At least the bastard was easy on the eyes. Otherwise, he’d be downright terrifying.

Elvis leaned against the car door, smirking. "Remember what I said, kid. Me touching you and letting you ride shotgun? That wasn’t free. Everything comes with a price."

Cassius blinked, processing that statement with growing alarm.

"Ugh."

Chasel recoiled. "You’re disgusting! Using your looks to manipulate me? Pathetic."

Elvis scowled. "You think I enjoyed it? I’m straight. You traumatized me, you little menace."

Chasel’s face burned crimson. "I’m not a kid. I’m a grown man. You’re the one who looks like he hasn’t hit puberty yet!"

Elvis’s eyebrow shot up. "Excuse me?"

"You’re clearly impotent." Chasel’s gaze dropped pointedly.

Elvis lunged, but Cassius blocked him. "Elvis, Mr. Bright is Suri’s nephew and Evadne’s guest. Control yourself."

"Damn it. If it weren’t for Evadne, I’d wreck him!" Elvis growled.

Cassius sighed, finally understanding why Elvis had gagged Chasel earlier.

He stepped forward, untying Chasel’s restraints himself.

Chasel’s skin was porcelain-pale, the ropes leaving angry red marks. Something protective stirred in Cassius.

"Ouch, that hurts." Chasel rubbed his wrists, wincing.

Elvis rolled his eyes. "Drama queen."

Cassius eyed Chasel’s swollen ankles. "Can you stand?"

Chasel bit his lip, attempting to rise.

His legs, numb from hours of confinement, buckled instantly.

He pitched forward—straight into Cassius’s arms.

Cassius reacted instinctively, one arm locking around Chasel’s waist to steady him.

Two grown men, tangled like some cheesy romance scene. Elvis gaped.

"Sorry." Chasel’s cheeks flushed.

Normally, he’d be seething. But wrapped in this man’s embrace, his anger dissolved.

"Don’t apologize. We’re the ones who should."

Without hesitation, Cassius swept Chasel into his arms.

Chasel’s heart hammered.

He wasn’t a saint. He’d indulged in plenty of reckless flings, especially when drunk. That’s how he’d fallen into Elvis’s trap.

But this? This felt different.

Before he could think, his arms looped around Cassius’s neck.

"What the hell is this?"

Evadne, Arnold, and Jason arrived, jaws dropping.

"Is that a man or a woman in President Ashbourne’s arms?" Jason squinted.

Arnold’s eyes lit up. "Wait—is that our future brother-in-law?"

Evadne stared. "That’s clearly a man!"

Arnold and Jason leaned in. "A man?!"

Sure enough, a slender, fox-eyed man nestled in Cassius’s hold.

Arnold sighed. "Damn. I thought one of you Ashbourne men might finally settle down."

Jason smirked. "Why’s he so eager to carry another dude?"

"Mr. Bright, you must be exhausted." Evadne stepped forward, all poise. "Apologies for my brother’s behavior."

"You’re the Evadne my aunt raves about?" Chasel sniffed, still cradled like royalty.

"I am."

Evadne’s smile didn’t waver. "You’re probably starving. How about dinner and a hot bath before we talk?"

"Ms. Ashbourne, this is kidnapping. I could sue you." Chasel’s glare could melt steel.

"I know. We’ve been terrible hosts." Evadne’s eyes sparkled. "To make it up to you, how about K Group’s CEO joins you for dinner?"

She tilted her head. "And if you’d like, he can even help with your bath."

Chasel’s breath hitched.

The room erupted in shock.

The Ashbourne princess was pimping out her own brother without blinking.

In the living room, Evadne curled into Elvis’s side. To an outsider, they might’ve looked like newlyweds.

"Elvis, you outdid yourself this time." She smiled sweetly.

"Just bringing home a stray. No big deal." He ruffled her hair, gaze soft. "If it makes you happy, I’d kill for you."

Jason paled. Arnold nearly spat out his tea.

Cassius descended the stairs.

"He’s asleep."

"Poor thing. Let him rest." Evadne sighed. "I pushed too hard. If he refuses to help now—"

"Evadne, relax." Cassius draped an arm around her. "We’ll handle what you can’t."

"Yeah," Arnold chimed in. "Let us be useful for once."

Evadne’s eyes welled up.

She never took their love for granted.

"Hey, listen to this." Elvis grinned. "When I was abroad, I saw a woman who looked just like you. I tapped her shoulder—turned around and screamed at me. First person besides you to ever yell at me."

Arnold snorted. "Wow, she can’t even yell at you now? You’re something else." He sipped his tea. "And Evadne’s one of a kind. No way there’s a doppelgänger."

"You asking for another ass-kicking?" Elvis glowered.

"Elvis, did she really look like me?" Evadne asked, curious.

"Identical. I never mistake faces." Elvis rubbed his chin. "You think Dad had another kid?"

Evadne and Arnold groaned.

Cassius shook his head. "The world’s big. Doppelgängers exist. Stop reading horror stories."

Suddenly, Evadne stiffened.

That snowy night flashed in her mind—Thaddeus gripping her arms, desperate.

He’d sworn he was innocent.

That he’d followed her to the hotel because he saw her double with a stranger. That’s how he got caught in that scandal.

Her pulse spiked.

What if he’d been telling the truth?

What if that woman really existed?

But then—why was Edith there? And why did he enter her room?
###Chapter 367

"Hey, why the thousand-yard stare?"

Elijah noticed Elara zoning out completely and snapped his fingers in front of her face to bring her back.

"Elijah."

Elara hesitated, her voice trailing off as she recalled the woman who looked eerily similar to her.

"What's up, Elara? You're never this hesitant. Spit it out," Elijah pressed, brows furrowed.

"It's nothing."

Just a woman he'd stumbled upon years ago in another country.

Even if she had suspicions, digging into this woman's identity wasn't an option. Her only lead was through Edith.

But what was the point?

Thaddeus had made it crystal clear—in front of her grandfather, no less—that they were over. No take-backs.

So why was she hesitating? Why was she mourning?

Elara let out a quiet, bitter laugh and drained her lukewarm tea.

How pathetic was she, pining for a man who'd abandoned her twice? Shouldn't she be relieved she hadn't repeated the same mistake?

Beside her, Cassian took in her conflicted emotions without a word. Instead, he wordlessly wrapped his warm fingers around her cold ones, squeezing gently.

"Did you tell Serena and Emery about Chase?" Elara asked softly.

Emery had taken Mira abroad to help her recover, and Serena and Ava had tagged along. They were staying in separate villas, though.

The grand Ashbourne estate felt unusually empty these days, with just the two of them there.

"We called Serena already."

Cassian smiled faintly. "She said not to treat him like a guest. Handle him however you see fit. She'd even disown him if it made you happy."

Elara couldn't help but laugh. She knew they all adored her.

"Damn, talk about cutting ties for justice—or just cutting ties, period," Adrian muttered, jaw slack.

Elijah pulled a cigarette from his jacket pocket and lit it, the picture of effortless cool. "Helping others is justice. Helping that bastard Thaddeus? That's just disowning family."

Silence.

Elara blinked but said nothing.

"Elara, there's something I want to say, but I'm not sure if I should."

"Then don't," Elara cut in, already knowing where this was going.

It wouldn't be pleasant.

"Thaddeus has severe neurological damage because of me. His nervous system's compromised. We don't know what'll happen—intermittent blackouts, paralysis..." Her voice was tight.

Elijah frowned at her words.

"I don't want anything to do with him, but I don't want to feel like I owe him either."

Elara met Elijah's gaze, her eyes clear but pained. "I'm not trying to save him. I'm trying to save myself."

The air in the room grew heavy.

Adrian, ever the opportunist, suddenly blurted, "Hey, Cassian, is Chase really a guy?"

Cassian didn't miss a beat. "Yes."

"What's it like holding him?"

Elijah smirked. "Damn, Adrian, I thought you were straight. Didn't know you had those kinds of interests. Next time, just say so. No need to make me seduce him for you."

"What the hell are you talking about?" Adrian's eyes nearly bulged out of his skull. "I've just never seen a guy that pretty before. Curiosity, okay?"

Elara was speechless.

"Who gets that curious about other guys?" Elijah teased.

"It's called being young! Old people lose their sense of wonder!" Adrian shot back.

The brothers bickered until the night wound down.

The Next Day

Chase, thanks to jet lag, slept until noon.

He'd just cracked his eyes open when insistent knocking rattled his door.

At first, he ignored it. But the person outside was relentless.

"Jesus, what?" Chase groaned, yanking the door open.

Cassian stood there, impeccably dressed.

Chase blinked.

Cassian's gaze flickered from Chase's toned chest to his abs before landing on his—

Cheerful boxer shorts.

His expression darkened slightly.

"Like what you see, cousin?" Chase leaned against the doorframe, smirking.

He was shameless by nature. Nudity wouldn't faze him.

But Cassian—tall, composed, and unfairly handsome in that suit—made his pulse skip.

"Your shorts are... cute," Cassian murmured, voice low.

"Sleep well?"

"Could've been better. Would've helped if someone warmed the bed," Chase grumbled, still sore about being kidnapped. "Can I come in?"

Chase pressed his lips together and stepped aside.

They moved to the living room, where Chase sprawled on the sofa, legs propped on the coffee table. His dark eyes locked onto Cassian. "What's so urgent you had to wake me?"

Then he noticed the first-aid kit on the table.

Before he could react, Cassian dropped to one knee and grabbed his ankle.

Heat shot to Chase's cheeks. He recoiled. "W-what are you doing?"

"You've got a scrape. Let me treat it."

Cassian didn't wait for permission. He swabbed the wound with alcohol.

The sting was sharp but oddly soothing. Chase's toes curled.

As a doctor, he knew the injury was minor. But he wasn't used to being cared for.

Living abroad, far from family, he hadn't made many real friends.

So when Cassian tended to him, his chest tightened.

The room was quiet, thick with tension.

"Keep it dry. Even small wounds can scar."

Cassian packed up the kit, voice soft. "You've got skin like my sister's. Too perfect to ruin."

"Cassian." Chase leaned in, smirking. "Ever heard 'Beware Greeks bearing gifts'?"

Cassian met his gaze head-on.

Their faces were close. Too close.

Cassian's pulse jumped. "What are you implying?"

"Are you buttering me up for Elara, or do you actually care?"

Chase's voice wasn't feminine, but it was undeniably alluring.

"You're Elara's guest and Serena's nephew. It's only right I look after you."

Cassian's eyes dropped.

"Always the diplomat." Chase scoffed and turned away. "Leave. I'm booking a flight home tomorrow."

"Still mad?" Cassian settled beside him.

"What do you think?"

"What can I do to make it up to you?"

"Have that asshole Elijah apologize, and I'll consider it."

Chase was still fuming over being kidnapped.

"How about something else?"

"No. That's what I want."

"Even if I ask, he won't do it. He's probably already gone." Cassian smiled. "Name anything else."

Chase thought for a second, then grinned. "Careful, Cassian. Don't make promises you can't keep."

"Try me."

"Stay with me tonight. Can you do that?"

Chase propped his chin on his hand, admiring Cassian's profile.

Cassian suddenly loosened his tie.

Chase swallowed hard.

Normally, he'd pounce. But Cassian's presence was overwhelming.

Knock, knock, knock.

"Cassian? Is Chase awake? Lunch is ready."

Elara's voice floated through the door.

Cassian stood smoothly. "You must be starving. Elara's an amazing cook. She doesn't cook for just anyone."

Chase wanted to refuse, but his stomach growled.

Fine.

He'd make the best of it.

After lunch, Cassian retreated to his room and locked the door.

He sat at his desk, expression hardening.

He undid his tie and unbuttoned his collar, finally breathing easier.

A silver cross pendant slipped free, glinting in the dim light.

Cassian closed his eyes, steadying his racing heart.

But the face that surfaced wasn't Chase's—it was another man's.

A man he thought he'd forgotten.

The man he'd once loved.

Cassian pulled two books from the shelf.

A hidden compartment clicked open, revealing a safe.

He entered the man's birthday—and his own.

Inside were framed photos, a sealed file, and a velvet box.

Cassian opened the box. A pair of diamond rings gleamed.

He slid one onto his left ring finger, then picked up the photos.

In them, a handsome, smiling man had his arms around Cassian. Their intimacy was undeniable.

They'd been together.

The man had fox-like eyes—just like Chase's.

Seeing those eyes last night had unraveled him.

Cassian's breath hitched. He pressed his lips to the photo.

On the back, neat handwriting read: Cassian, I hope one day, the world forgives us.

"But you didn't wait for that day," he whispered.

Death wasn't the worst part.

The worst was being reminded—over and over—of what he'd lost.

Elara had cooked a feast for Chase.

Despite her hiatus, her skills were impeccable. Even their family chef wanted lessons.

Chase's mouth watered.

"Just some home cooking. Hope you like it." Elara grinned.

But Chase was stubborn.

"Ms. Ashbourne, even if you're Serena's favorite, your charm won't work on me. I don't treat the elite. Thaddeus has doctors lining up to kiss his ass. They don't need me. My answer's final."

Hmm.

Had Cassian's efforts failed?

Elara stayed calm.

She knew men cared about two things: pride and competition.

She sipped her tea. "As a top surgeon, you've never lost a patient. You only take cases you're 100% sure you can handle, right?"

The mood shifted.

A challenge hung in the air.
###Chapter 368

Chasel's pupils dilated as if struck by an insult to his very soul. His porcelain skin flushed crimson, lips trembling before he managed to choke out, "Excuse me?"

"Has Dr. Bright spent so long overseas that he's forgotten his native language?" Evadne's gaze sharpened like honed steel, her smile laced with unspoken dominance. "Shall I translate for you?"

Few women wielded such a smile—one that blended regal command with reckless daring, effortlessly crushing Chasel's rebellious aura beneath its weight.

"Are you implying I refused Thaddeus because I couldn't cure him?" His jaw clenched.

"Is there another explanation?" She shrugged.

"Ridiculous!"

Chasel slammed the table, rattling the teacups. "Have you forgotten my reputation abroad eclipses even Dr. Eve's? I've tackled impossible cases, snatched lives from Death's grip—he toasts me! And you dare question my skills?"

Evadne merely watched, silent, savoring his unraveling composure.

Then, like a fox catching its own tail, Chasel leaned back with a smirk. "Ah, almost fell for your bait, Ms. Ashbourne. Your tactics might work on vain men, but I don’t chase pride."

"Of course. A man of principle." Her tone dripped irony. "Yet Thaddeus Abernathy isn’t just another wealthy patient. His philanthropy has saved thousands. Surely you’ve heard of his foundation?"

She paused, startled by her own words.

Even divorced, praising Thaddeus came unnaturally easy. Strip away the heartbreak, and he was exceptional—flawless, save for love. No wonder she’d adored him for thirteen years.

"Your flattery changes nothing." Chasel crossed his arms. "You dragged me here against my will. That’s not respect—it’s tyranny. I’m leaving. Try stopping me, and I’ll call the police."

As he turned, Evadne sipped her tea. "Pity. Even Dr. Eve failed. I thought you might succeed."

He froze. "Dr. Eve treated him?! Why would she—"

"Bother?" Evadne’s cup hit the saucer with a sharp clink.

"Nothing! She’s my idol!" Chasel’s voice turned reverent. "Though we’ve never met, her brilliance is unmatched. Her surgical breakthroughs would take others decades to replicate."

Evadne rubbed her chin. If only he knew.

"A man Dr. Eve deemed worth saving," she pressed. "Do you really doubt his character? Or are you questioning hers?"

Moral blackmail? Perhaps. But with this slippery fox, she’d use every weapon.

Chasel exhaled, pulling a chair back. "...Fine. For her, I’ll examine him."

A smirk tugged Evadne’s lips. "On behalf of Dr. Eve, thank you."

Elvis Ashbourne wasn’t one to idle. Home for a rare visit, he reverted to old habits—sleeping by day, prowling by night.

"People will think you’re a vampire," Arnold teased when Elvis dragged him to a bar.

They chose a shadowed booth, but anonymity was futile. The Ashbourne brothers attracted stares like moths to flame. Women approached relentlessly, forcing them into a drinking game: one shot per interruption.

By midnight, Elvis was done. When a brunette pressed against him, he dodged and flashed his phone. "My wife. Gorgeous, isn’t she?"

Arnold choked on his whiskey. The screen showed Evadne.

"Elvis!" Arnold hissed. "Using your sister as a shield? That’s twisted!"

"Why hide her?" Elvis drained his glass, bitterness seeping into his grin. "Unlike that cheating bastard who took her for granted."

Arnold sighed. "Thaddeus?"

"Who else?" A cigarette dangled from Elvis’s lips. "I don’t get why she’s helping him. He deserves to rot."

"Think of it as rescuing a stray."

"Will Chasel agree?"

"With Evadne involved? Definitely."

Elvis exhaled smoke. "Before I leave, maybe I’ll sneak into the OR and—" He drew a finger across his throat.

Arnold paled. "Don’t. You’ll start a war."

"Relax. Joking." Elvis stood, swaying slightly. "Need to sober up."

He vanished into the pulsating dance floor, where strobe lights painted the crowd in neon. Women pressed close, but one scent cut through the haze—familiar, intoxicating.

A body collided with his. Soft. Warm.

Under the flickering lights, he squinted—then stiffened.

"E-Evadne?!"

No. This woman had a beauty mark above her brow. Evadne would never wear this cloying perfume.

Recognition struck.

Her. The woman from his time abroad. The one he couldn’t forget.

"Handsome, you know me?" She draped her arms around his neck, breath hot against his skin. "I don’t know you... but I like your approach."

Elsie Archer smiled, drunk and daring.
###Chapter 369

Elvis's pulse raced, his heart hammering against his ribs like a trapped bird.

It wasn't often his composure shattered like this, but the woman in his arms—restless, intoxicating—had thrown him off balance.

Not that he was falling for her.

No, it was the uncanny resemblance to Evadne that unsettled him. Holding a woman who looked like his sister while she flirted shamelessly? Disorienting didn’t even begin to cover it.

"Ugh. I think I'm gonna be sick." Elsie's voice was a fragile whisper, her eyes glistening with unshed tears as she swayed dangerously.

Too much alcohol. Too much dancing. Now her stomach revolted.

"Help me to the bathroom," she gasped, clutching his arm. "Please."

Under normal circumstances, Elvis would’ve walked away without a second thought.

But that face—so eerily familiar—made refusal impossible.

With effortless strength, he scooped her up, her slender frame feather-light in his arms, and strode toward the restrooms.

The dance floor buzzed with whispers.

"Damn, did you see that? He carried her like she weighed nothing!"

"Dream boyfriend material right there."

"Wait—doesn’t she look exactly like Evadne Ashbourne? The socialite who’s always trending?"

"Pfft, as if the Ashbourne heiress would be here without bodyguards. Probably some wannabe who paid for the face."

Elvis couldn’t take her to the women’s room, so he barged into the men’s instead.

Two startled patrons froze mid-zip, gaping as the icy-eyed stranger deposited a stunning woman by the sink.

"Finished?" Elvis kicked the door shut behind them. "Get out."

They scrambled away, not daring to argue.

Elsie hunched over the sink, retching violently.

Elvis leaned against the wall, lighting a cigarette, watching her through the haze of smoke.

The longer he studied her, the more differences he noticed. Evadne was elegance incarnate—untouchable, refined.

This woman? Raw, reckless.

When she finally straightened, her reflection stared back—pale, sickly, like a ghost of the woman she mimicked.

Avery’s careful masterpiece.

A sharp pang twisted her chest. She pressed a hand over her heart, forcing a bitter smile.

"Done?" Elvis’s voice cut through the silence.

Elsie startled, as if noticing him for the first time. "Y-You—"

"Me," he confirmed dryly. "The guy you begged to bring you here while calling me 'hottie.' Now you’re just gonna walk away?"

Her cheeks flushed. "I never—this is the ladies' room. You shouldn’t be here."

Elvis smirked, nodding toward the urinals. "Pretty sure those disagree."

Mortified, Elsie spun to leave—only for his hand to snap around her wrist, yanking her back.

She collided with his chest, the impact sending sparks through her veins.

His gaze burned into her. "No 'thank you'?"

"Th-Thank you," she stammered, pulse erratic.

"Has anyone ever told you," his breath brushed her ear, "you look like someone?"

Her heart lurched. She twisted free, but he held firm.

"No," she lied. "I’m just me."

A lie that tasted like ash.

This face wasn’t hers. It was Evadne’s. Avery’s obsession.

"Then tell me," Elvis challenged, "who are you?"

Before she could answer, her phone rang.

BOSS flashed on the screen.

Her blood turned to ice.

Wrenching free, she bolted like a hunted animal, fleeing through the back exit.

Elvis followed, curiosity piqued.

Outside, blinding headlights pinned her in place.

A bodyguard stepped forward. "Miss Archer. The boss is waiting."

Her stomach dropped.

The sleek black car loomed like a coffin. Inside sat the man she loved—and feared.

The door opened. She slid in, trembling.

Avery’s voice was a blade in the dark.

"Did I not forbid you from returning to Elmsworth?"

Elsie’s throat closed. "I—I’m sorry, Mr. Chambers."

Cold fingers clamped around her neck, cutting off air.

"Sorry?" Avery hissed. "Your face is my investment. My weapon. You don’t get to disobey."

Her vision blurred.

Harvey intervened frantically. "Sir, she’ll pass out!"

Avery released her with a disgusted flick, wiping his hands on a handkerchief before tossing it away.

"Fix your face when we return. If not for it, you’d be dead."

Elsie choked back tears. "Thank you... and thank Ms. Ashbourne."

Avery adjusted his glasses. "Did that man touch you?"

"No!" she lied instantly. "I was drunk. It was nothing."

His gaze turned glacial. "Harvey. Find out who he is."

As the car sped away, Elvis emerged from the shadows, memorizing the license plate.

"Elsie Archer," he murmured.

Meanwhile, across the bar, Arnold’s night took another turn.

A half-conscious Camille struggled against two leering foreigners.

"Let me go!"

"Let her go."

Arnold’s voice cut through the chaos, cold as steel.

Camille’s bleary eyes met his—and for the first time that night, she felt hope.
###Chapter 370

Camille's breath hitched, her lips pressing into a tight line as she fought to stay silent.

One of the foreigners turned to Arnold with a sneer. "Who the hell are you? This isn't your fight—back off!"

Arnold smirked, unfazed. "Wasn't my business until I saw it. Now it is."

Damn.

The way he stood there—confident, unshaken—sent a jolt through Camille.

Evadne's brothers weren't just handsome. They carried themselves like royalty, sharp-edged and untouchable.

And Arnold? The way he shielded her, the way his voice dropped low—dangerous—made her pulse spike.

"You got a death wish?" The second foreigner snarled, signaling to his men. "Get rid of him!"

Arnold's expression hardened. "Try it."

Within seconds, bodyguards swarmed from the shadows, surrounding them.

Camille's stomach lurched. These weren't just hired muscle—they moved like professionals.

Arnold's jaw clenched. He hadn't brawled in years, but Emeric had drilled combat into all his children. Still, outnumbered like this?

"Arnold, go!" Camille's voice cracked. "Get out of here!"

His gaze locked onto hers. "Not without you."

Then he lunged.

The first two bodyguards went down before they could blink. Arnold moved like lightning, his strikes precise, brutal.

Camille barely had time to gasp before another guard raised an iron rod behind him—

"No!"

She shoved forward, crashing into Arnold just as the rod swung.

A deafening crash echoed.

The attacker crumpled, a metal trash can rolling beside him.

Camille's vision swam. When she looked up, Elvis stood there, hands in his pockets, grinning.

"Took you long enough," he drawled.

Arnold exhaled sharply, his grip tightening around Camille. "Elvis—"

"Go." Elvis cracked his knuckles. "I'll handle cleanup."

Arnold didn't argue. He scooped Camille up and bolted.

Outside, the night air was sharp against her flushed skin. Arnold flagged a cab, bundling her inside.

"Your brother—" Camille stammered.

"Elvis can take care of himself." Arnold shrugged off his jacket, draping it over her trembling shoulders. "He's been itching for a fight."

Camille swallowed hard. "Those men... they're connected. They won't let this go."

"Which is why you're not going home alone." Arnold's voice left no room for argument.

Her eyes widened. "What?"

"My place. Until this blows over."

Camille bristled. "I don't need a babysitter."

Arnold leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. "You nearly got dragged into a backroom tonight. Forgive me if I don't trust your judgment right now."

The driver cleared his throat. "Where to, lovebirds?"

Arnold rattled off an address.

Camille's nails dug into her palms. "This is kidnapping."

Arnold smirked. "Call it protective custody."

The cab pulled away, leaving the chaos behind.

Camille huffed, crossing her arms. "You're insufferable."

Arnold's gaze darkened. "And you're reckless."

Silence stretched between them, thick with tension.

Then, quietly, Camille muttered, "Thank you."

Arnold's fingers brushed hers—brief, electric. "Don't make a habit of needing saving."

She glared. "Don't make a habit of playing hero."

The corner of his mouth lifted. "Too late."

The city lights blurred past, but all Camille could focus on was the heat of Arnold's hand, still wrapped around hers.

And the unsettling realization that she didn't want him to let go.
###Chapter 371

Elvis had already taken care of the two foreigners, along with their useless bodyguards who were no match for him. He left them battered and bruised, noses bleeding, faces swollen, locked inside the restroom stall with a "Do Not Disturb" sign hanging outside.

Pathetic.

They barely gave him a warm-up.

But he couldn’t afford to make a scene. This was Elmsworth, not overseas. Given his position, he had to keep things low-key.

As he stepped out of the nightclub, his phone buzzed—Arnold calling.

"All done," Elvis said, stifling a yawn. "You can relax and enjoy your time with your girlfriend now. They won’t be bothering her again."

"She’s not my girlfriend," Arnold snapped, his tone sharp enough to cut glass.

Elvis smirked. "Oh, please. The way you swooped in like some knight in shining armor? The way she knew your name and practically threw herself into your arms? Don’t insult my intelligence."

He whistled. "What’s the big deal? Dating isn’t a crime. Or are you planning to stay single until you’re forty and officially labeled an old bachelor?"

"Elvis," Arnold growled, taking a deep breath. "Do me a favor."

"Name it."

"Dig into those two guys who harassed Camille tonight. We only handled half the problem. I don’t want them coming after her again."

"Already on it," Elvis said. "They’re just high-ranking execs from some foreign construction company. Not exactly big players in Elmsworth."

"Construction company?"

"Yeah. Your girlfriend sure knows how to pick her acquaintances."

Elvis chuckled. "Evadne’s going to love this juicy gossip."

Arnold’s voice turned icy. "If you care about Evadne’s peace of mind, don’t breathe a word of this to her."

A pause.

"Camille is her best friend," Arnold continued, his tone softening slightly. "If she finds out, she’ll lose sleep over it."

Elvis blinked. "Well, well. Small world."

"Shut up. I’m hanging up."

And just like that, the line went dead.

Elvis grinned, then pulled out his sleek, ultra-thin laptop—a piece of cutting-edge tech standard for senior agents like him. With a few taps, he pulled up the license plate of the luxury car from earlier.

The results flashed on screen.

"Chambers Group?" He arched a brow. "Interesting."

His gaze darkened as he thought of that face—so eerily similar to Evadne’s.

"Ms. Archer," he murmured. "Whose side are you really on? Matthew’s? Byron’s? Or Avery’s?"

Arnold brought Camille back to his apartment in Elmsworth.

For the prestigious heir of the Ashbourne family, his place was surprisingly modest—simple, clean, nothing extravagant.

Camille blinked, taking it in.

"You can stay here tonight," Arnold said, leading her to a guest room. "There’s a bathroom inside, and some spare pajamas in the closet. If you don’t mind wearing them."

Camille sighed. "Why are you so stubborn?"

Arnold crossed his arms. "Because you’re Evadne’s best friend. I can’t just walk away."

"About her—"

"Don’t worry," he cut in. "I won’t tell Evadne. I don’t want her worrying any more than you do."

Camille exhaled, relieved.

Evadne wasn’t just the person who’d saved her years ago—she was family. The last thing Camille wanted was to burden her.

Then her phone rang.

Her face paled as she glanced at the screen, fingers tightening around the device.

Arnold sensed the shift in her mood. Without a word, he stepped out, closing the door behind him.

But he didn’t leave.

He lingered, listening.

It wasn’t right, he knew. But something about Camille—something broken and guarded—made him want to protect her.

And despite his questions, she hadn’t told him the full truth.

As a prosecutor, he could spot evasion a mile away.

Inside the room, Camille took a shaky breath before answering.

"Dad."

"What the hell happened tonight?" Mr. Evert’s voice was cold, sharp with accusation.

"There was... an incident. The dinner ended early." Her voice was hoarse.

"What kind of incident? Do you have any idea how important this was?"

Mrs. Evert’s shrill voice cut in. "I told you she’d ruin everything! She’s useless!"

Camille’s fists clenched, her knuckles white.

One secret even Evadne didn’t know—Camille was the illegitimate daughter of the Evert Group’s CEO. Unacknowledged. Unwanted.

At sixteen, she’d nearly been raped by her uncle. Her mother, in a fit of rage, had stabbed him to death. The Everts, desperate to avoid scandal, had pulled strings—her mother was declared mentally unstable, locked away in an institution.

For years, they’d controlled Camille. Even now, as a successful designer, they held power over her.

Mrs. Evert had two golden children—a son, the heir, and a daughter, her pride.

Camille? She was nothing.

"Where are you?" Mr. Evert demanded.

"At a friend’s place."

"Tomorrow, you will come with me to apologize to those executives!"

Camille’s stomach twisted. The memory of their hands on her, their leering faces—

"No." Her voice was steel. "I won’t go."

"What did you say?!"

"You heard me. If you want to grovel, do it yourself."

Mrs. Evert sneered. "Do you have any idea what you’ve cost us? Thirty million dollars, Camille! How do you plan to repay that? With your pathetic little designs?"

"I’ll find a way to cover the loss."

"With what? Your sewing money?"

A laugh echoed in the background—her half-sister, Eunice.

"Come home now," Mr. Evert ordered.

"No." Camille’s voice cracked. "Did you know? Did you know what they were going to do to me?"

Silence.

Then, softer but no less cruel: "Camille, the family is in trouble. Sacrifices have to be made. Your sister is marrying into the Ger family for this very reason."

Tears burned her eyes. "You knew. And you sent me there anyway."

No answer.

Camille’s voice broke. "Is this what family does? Throw their own daughter into the fire?"

Arnold, standing outside, caught enough to piece it together.

His blood boiled.

What kind of monsters were these people?

A soft thud came from inside.

Worried, he knocked. No answer.

He pushed the door open—

"Camille?!"

She lay on the floor, unconscious, her face deathly pale.

Arnold dropped to his knees, checking her pulse.

Nothing.

Fear spiked through him.

"Stay with me!"

He started CPR, counting under his breath.

No response.

"Camille!"

Her lips were turning blue. Without hesitation, he leaned down, sealing his mouth over hers, breathing life back into her.

One breath. Two.

Her chest rose—then she gasped, eyes fluttering open.

Dazed, her hand reached up, brushing his cheek.

Arnold froze.

Then—

She pulled him down.

Their lips met.

Soft. Warm.

Her fingers tangled in his hair as she deepened the kiss, her breath sweet with lingering alcohol.

Arnold’s restraint shattered.

He kissed her back, hard, his hands gripping her waist.

He didn’t know how they’d gotten here.

But one thing was certain—

He didn’t want to stop.
###Chapter 372

Camille's sudden collapse sent shockwaves through the room. Arnold didn’t hesitate—he scooped her up and rushed to the nearest hospital, his fingers dialing Evadne’s number before he even reached the car.

He knew his sister. If he kept this from her any longer, the fallout would be catastrophic.

The next morning, Evadne stormed into the hospital, Jason trailing behind her like a shadow. Her usually composed face was twisted with worry, her nails digging into her palms.

“What the hell happened?” Her voice cracked, tears threatening to spill. “Since when does Camille have a heart condition?”

Arnold exhaled sharply. “The doctors said it’s mild, but she’s always been fragile.”

A heart condition?

Evadne’s knees nearly gave out. Jason caught her elbow, steadying her before she could collapse.

Guilt gnawed at her. Camille wasn’t just her student—she was family. And yet, Evadne had been blind to her suffering.

The memory of Camille’s phone call the night before flashed in Arnold’s mind. His jaw tightened. “She was upset. That’s what triggered it.”

He’d already told Evadne about their chance encounter, but he’d left out the ugly details. The screaming. The tears. The way Camille’s voice had shattered.

“Upset about what?” Evadne demanded, her eyes blazing.

Camille was sunshine personified. Nothing ever shook her.

Arnold rubbed his temples. “Ask her yourself when she wakes up.”

Jason cleared his throat. “Mr. Ashbourne, you stayed with her all night?”

Evadne’s eyebrows shot up.

Her brother—the man who recoiled at the mere thought of romance—had brought a woman home?

Arnold didn’t flinch. “She needed help.”

Evadne grabbed his arm. “What else happened?”

He flicked her forehead. “Nosy.”

But his pulse betrayed him. Did Camille remember the kiss? The way she’d melted against him?

The door creaked open. A nurse stepped out.

“She’s awake.”

Evadne didn’t wait. She shoved past, her heart in her throat.

Jason lingered, studying Arnold’s flushed face. “You okay?”

Arnold blinked. “Fine.”

Inside, Camille sat propped against the pillows, her skin as pale as the sheets. The morning light made her look ethereal—and heartbreakingly fragile.

“Camille.” Evadne’s voice trembled.

Camille flinched, tucking her IV-laden hand under the blanket.

“Who hurt you?” Evadne demanded.

Camille bit her lip.

“Tell me,” Evadne growled. “I’ll burn them to the ground.”

“It was just low blood sugar.”

“Bullshit.” Evadne grabbed her hand. “You have a heart condition. My brother said you got a call last night. Who was it?”

Camille’s lashes fluttered. “Evadne, please. Some things… I need to keep to myself.”

“No.” Evadne’s grip tightened. “You’re my family. Whoever did this will pay.”

Camille’s breath hitched. “Stay out of it.”

The words were a slap. Evadne recoiled.

When she stormed out, Jason stayed behind. She dragged Arnold to the hospital café, her mind racing.

“It’s her family,” Arnold said quietly, stirring sugar into her coffee. “I looked into it.”

He handed her his phone. The screen displayed a dossier on Camille Evert—illegitimate daughter of Spencer Evert, CEO of a mid-tier real estate firm.

Evadne’s blood boiled. “They used her?”

Arnold nodded. “Those men at the club were business associates.”

Evadne slammed her cup down. Coffee sloshed over the rim. “I’ll handle Spencer. You stay with Camille.”

Arnold hesitated.

“Promise me,” she snapped.

“Fine.”

Her phone buzzed. Cassius.

“Thaddeus will be at the gala tonight,” he said.

Evadne’s stomach twisted. “I’ll go.”

Back in Camille’s room, Arnold found her by the window, her voice shaking with rage.

“I’ve given enough!” she hissed into the phone. “What more do you want? My blood?”

Arnold snatched the phone.

Camille whirled, her tear-streaked face a mask of shock.

“Hello,” Arnold said coldly.

Spencer’s voice dripped with disdain. “Who the hell are you?”

Arnold’s lips curled. “Someone who’ll ruin you if you bother her again.”

He hung up before Spencer could retaliate.

Silence.

Camille stared at him, her chest rising and falling rapidly.

Arnold cleared his throat. “I had to say something.”

“I know.” She smiled bitterly. “Thank you.”

He studied her. “Do you remember last night?”

Her brow furrowed. “You saved me.”

So she didn’t recall the kiss.

Disappointment curled in his gut.

“What do you want to eat?” he asked abruptly.

“Pasta.”

Arnold rolled up his sleeves. “With eggs?”

Camille’s eyes softened. “Two.”

He grinned. “Done.”

By seven that evening, the pasta was gone—and Arnold’s resolve had hardened.

He wouldn’t let Spencer break her. Not again.
###Chapter 373

The Abernathy Hotel glittered once more with the elite gathering of Elmsworth's most powerful figures. After a marathon of business negotiations, the city's tycoons and socialites converged here to continue their networking over cocktails.

Behind the wheel of her sleek black Bugatti, Isabella Sinclair sped through the city streets with Nathaniel Whitmore gripping the passenger door, his knuckles white. He stared rigidly ahead, afraid that opening his mouth might result in last night's dinner making an unwelcome reappearance.

When they finally reached the hotel, Isabella executed a perfect drift into the parking spot, the tires screeching to a halt.

"Out," she commanded, unbuckling her seatbelt.

Nathaniel remained frozen, his face as pale as the moon.

Isabella blinked her almond-shaped eyes, waving a hand in front of his face. "Hey, earth to Nate. You alive in there?"

"I think I'm going to be sick," Nathaniel managed, his complexion taking on a distinctly greenish hue.

Isabella yelped and shoved the door open, pushing him out. "If you're going to puke, do it outside! Not in my car!"

The moment his feet hit the pavement, Nathaniel doubled over, emptying his stomach in the most undignified manner imaginable.

For a man of his refined upbringing, it was a first.

Thankfully, Sebastian wasn't around to witness it—otherwise, Nathaniel might have wished for the ground to swallow him whole.

Once he'd finished, Nathaniel weakly leaned against the car door, panting as he glared at Isabella. "Are all you Sinclairs insane? Driving like you're in a damn Formula One race!"

"You're a grown man getting carsick?" Isabella crossed her arms, shaking her head in disbelief. "My driving is smoother than silk. If you can't handle it, that's a you problem."

She tossed him a bottle of water, showing a shred of mercy.

Nathaniel rinsed his mouth, slowly regaining his composure.

"Don't forget our deal," Isabella reminded him, a faint smirk playing on her lips.

"I remember," Nathaniel muttered.

"You fix Adrian, and I introduce you to Dr. Sinclair. My word is gold."

If only Nathaniel knew that the woman currently tormenting him was the very Dr. Sinclair he idolized, he might have had a few choice words—and possibly a minor existential crisis.

Just then, a sleek black Bentley glided past them.

Isabella's eyes narrowed at the vaguely familiar license plate.

The Bentley parked nearby, and the driver stepped out to open the door.

Out stepped two people Isabella knew all too well—her scheming uncle, William Sinclair, and his equally conniving daughter, Arabella Sinclair.

"Dad, how do I look tonight?" Arabella asked eagerly, twirling in her one-shoulder pink evening gown, her silver diamond-encrusted clutch glinting under the lights. Her long hair cascaded over her shoulders, giving her the appearance of a wealthy heiress.

But Isabella could spot a knockoff from a mile away.

That designer would never lend an original to someone like Arabella, who lacked both social clout and commercial appeal. It would be brand suicide.

"Stunning! You'll be the belle of the ball tonight!" William gushed, showering his daughter with praise.

Arabella preened, already basking in imaginary admiration.

"Being the center of attention doesn't matter," she simpered. "What matters is whether Mr. Kingsley notices me."

Isabella's eyebrows shot up at that.

Nathaniel, meanwhile, felt his nausea returning at Arabella's theatrics.

"Just be yourself, sweetheart. Show him your best qualities, and he'll fall for you in no time," William encouraged, then couldn't resist adding with a sneer, "You're already miles better than that wild child, Isabella. You just need the right opportunity. Isabella and Mr. Kingsley were never a good match—no wonder they divorced."

Isabella listened impassively, her expression unreadable.

Nathaniel gaped as William and Arabella strutted away.

"Adrian is your ex-husband?" he blurted.

"Yep. Not exactly a state secret," Isabella replied flatly.

"Well, you're certainly the most... interesting ex-wife I've ever met," Nathaniel teased. "Most divorced couples want to strangle each other, but here you are, going out of your way to cure your ex's illness. Old flames still burning, or does he have dirt on you?"

"I just want a clear conscience. Let's go." Isabella turned on her heel and strode toward the hotel.

Nathaniel watched her retreating figure—strong, icy, and radiating an aura that could cut through steel. For a woman in her early twenties, she carried herself like a force of nature.

He couldn't help but grin. "Isabella Sinclair, you just keep getting more fascinating."

William had stopped to schmooze with some acquaintances, leaving Arabella to enter the banquet hall alone.

She sauntered up to the entrance with an air of entitlement, presenting her invitation to the staff.

"Miss Sinclair, please come in."

"Thank you."

As Arabella flipped her hair and prepared to make her grand entrance, the sharp click of heels behind her made her turn.

Her face fell.

Isabella and Nathaniel were walking toward the banquet hall side by side.

Arabella's jaw clenched. Why was this witch here? There had been no warning!

And who was that ridiculously handsome man beside her? A new fling?

"Cousin! What a surprise to see you here!" Arabella's expression instantly morphed into fake warmth.

Nathaniel scoffed. Had he not witnessed their earlier exchange in the parking lot, he might have believed they were close.

This was exactly why he avoided high society—too much hypocrisy.

"What's so surprising? You're here. Why wouldn't I be?" Isabella didn't even glance at her, her red lips curling into a smirk.

"Well, you've always been so... reclusive, cousin. You never attend these events."

"Get used to it." Isabella's gaze sharpened. "From now on, I'll be making regular appearances. We'll be seeing a lot more of each other."

Arabella forced a smile while internally seething.

"Miss, may I see your invitation?" a staff member asked Isabella politely.

"I don't have one," Isabella admitted breezily.

Arabella couldn't suppress a giggle. "Oh cousin, have you been away from society so long you forgot you need an invitation? You're embarrassing yourself."

The staff looked uncomfortable. "I'm sorry, miss, but without an invitation, you can't enter."

"I'm Isabella Sinclair," she said simply.

The name hit like a thunderbolt. The staff members froze.

In the past, Isabella might have said, "My father is William." But now, her name alone carried weight.

"Ms. Sinclair! Our apologies!" they stammered.

"No need. I had last-minute business with Mr. Kingsley. My oversight." Isabella smiled graciously. "Since I don't have an invitation, I understand if I can't enter. Could you inform him I'm here?"

"No need! Ms. Sinclair, please come in!" The staff fell over themselves to accommodate her.

"Thank you. This is Mr. Whitmore, my guest. May we enter together?"

"Of course! Right this way!"

Isabella and Nathaniel were ushered in with deference.

Arabella was left standing alone, her face burning with humiliation.

It was always like this. No matter what she did, Isabella stole the spotlight the moment she appeared.

Meanwhile, Adrian Kingsley and Lucas Grant were approaching the banquet hall.

"How's Seraphina settling in at your place?" Adrian asked, his tone neutral but concern flickering beneath.

"She's doing well. Planning to take her on vacation after wrapping up some business." Lucas's eyes softened at the mention of Seraphina. "Found a psychologist to help with her autism and trauma."

"Trauma? What trauma?" Adrian stopped walking.

"Not sure. Lillian mentioned it. Probably from that witch Glynnis. But don't worry—I made sure she won't bother Seraphina again." Lucas's smile turned icy. "If she tries, I'll pluck her bald."

Adrian raised an eyebrow. "You did something to Glynnis?"

"Just curious."

"Just disfigured her a bit." Lucas grinned, recalling Glynnis's wails in the warehouse.

"That explains why she's been hiding lately." Adrian mused, then fixed Lucas with a stern look. "Seraphina's been with you a while. You haven't... overstepped, have you?"

Lucas's mind flashed to their intimate moment in the bathroom last night, heat rising to his face.

Before he could stammer a reply, Gordon rushed over.

"Mr. Kingsley! Ms. Sinclair is here!"

Lucas's eyes widened. Adrian seemed momentarily dazed. "Who?"

"Ms. Sinclair! Isabella! She's in the banquet hall now!" Gordon couldn't hide his excitement.

He'd missed Mrs. Kingsley. Whether Adrian admitted it or not, he clearly did too.

"Isabella came to see you? Finally!" Lucas clapped Adrian on the back.

"Half of Elmsworth's elite are here tonight." Adrian suppressed the flutter in his chest. "She's probably just networking. She'll inherit Sinclair Holdings someday."

"You're impossible." Lucas groaned, then asked Gordon, "Did she come alone? Or with Sebastian?"

"Neither. She's with a man," Gordon said.

"Please don't say it's that Chambers bastard," Lucas growled, thinking of Alexander.

"No. Exceptionally handsome—almost pretty." Gordon had only glimpsed Nathaniel from afar, but his beauty was undeniable.

Adrian's expression darkened.

Not her brothers. Not Alexander. Someone new.

He'd thought he'd moved on, but anything concerning Isabella still pulled at him.

Adrian quickened his pace toward the banquet hall.

The moment he entered, his eyes locked onto Isabella, radiant as ever in the crowd.

She wore a tailored black suit, her red lips a sinful contrast against her porcelain skin. Just seeing her made his carefully constructed walls tremble.

Lucas discreetly retreated, avoiding third-wheeling.

Once, he'd loved making grand entrances. Now, with Seraphina in his life, he avoided crowds—especially those with women. His heart belonged to one.

Isabella sensed Adrian's presence before she saw him.

To her, he was like a flame in the dark—impossible to ignore, no matter how hard she tried.

Infuriating.

When would this man stop haunting her?

The room buzzed with chatter and clinking glasses.
###Chapter 374

The world around them seemed to vanish the moment Alexander Kingsley and Isabella Sinclair's gazes met.

Dolores Ashbourne's heart raced when she spotted the man she'd been obsessing over.

She fumbled for her compact, hastily powdering her nose and smoothing her hair. With trembling hands, she took tentative steps toward Alexander—only to be blocked by a swarm of socialites who had already encircled him.

Frustration burned through her as she clenched the fabric of her dress.

Why was it so impossible to get near him?

And how had Isabella—of all people—managed to marry someone like him? The unfairness of it all made her blood boil.

Determined, Dolores shoved her way forward, ignoring the glares.

Just as she reached Alexander, she feigned a stumble and flung herself into his arms.

His expression darkened as he tried to step back, but the crowd trapped him in place. The cloying scent of her perfume made his head spin.

"Oh, Mr. Kingsley! I'm so sorry—I lost my balance!" Dolores pressed her hands against his chest, batting her lashes.

But when she looked up, his icy stare sent a chill down her spine.

From the staircase, Elspeth and Glynnis watched the scene unfold.

Glynnis, her face still healing beneath layers of makeup, squinted. "Who is that woman?"

Elspeth yawned, still exhausted from her late-night tryst with a certain young doctor. "Some Ashbourne girl, apparently. Desperate, if you ask me."

Glynnis smirked. "Rumor has it she and Isabella don’t get along."

Elspeth’s lips curled. "Now that makes things interesting."

Meanwhile, Isabella observed the spectacle, her expression unreadable.

Chasel sipped his champagne lazily. "I see why you divorced him. Too much trouble."

Isabella shot him a glare. "Shut up."

Alexander finally shoved Dolores away with such force she stumbled back, landing ungracefully on the floor.

Gasps filled the room.

Bevis Ashbourne, who had just entered, paled at the sight of his humiliated daughter.

Then, the sharp click of heels echoed through the hall.

"Mr. Kingsley."

The crowd parted instantly.

Alexander’s breath caught as Isabella approached, cool and composed.

Whispers erupted.

"It's Isabella Sinclair!"

"She’s even more stunning in person!"

Alexander didn’t hesitate. He stepped over Dolores as if she were nothing and followed Isabella out.

The garden was quiet, the night air crisp.

"You didn’t come with Mr. Chambers," Alexander said coldly.

"And you didn’t come alone," Isabella countered. "Though I didn’t expect you’d take an interest in my cousin."

His jaw tightened. "We’re divorced. Who I associate with is none of your concern."

She smiled thinly. "If you like Dolores, I could introduce you properly. Maybe we’ll be family again."

Alexander’s fists clenched.

No one could provoke him like she did.

No one.

He closed the distance between them, caging her against a tree. His voice was low, dangerous. "If you chose to leave me, why do you keep appearing in front of me?"

Isabella met his gaze, unflinching.

His lips brushed her ear as he whispered, "I loved you. But that doesn’t mean you get to trample my pride."

The words cut deep.

Neither moved.

The silence between them was louder than any argument.
###Chapter 375

The words struck Isabella like a blade—sharp, merciless, drawing blood.

"Alexander," she said, her voice trembling with restrained fury, "I never once trampled on your pride. After the divorce, wasn’t it you who kept chasing after me? Every. Single. Time?"

Tears welled in her eyes, but her lips curled into a defiant smirk—beautiful yet heartbreaking. "You threw away your own dignity, and now you’re blaming me? Have you lost all sense of shame?"

She shouldn’t have cared.

She shouldn’t have given him another thought.

She should’ve let him drown in his own misery.

Alexander's breath hitched. A wave of dizziness crashed over him, making his tall frame sway slightly.

"What the hell are you doing?!"

Whoosh!

Before she could finish, a small stone flew through the air, striking Alexander squarely on the back of his head.

He winced, his brows knitting together in pain.

In an instant, Daniel was striding forward, reaching to grab the man’s collar.

But Alexander was faster.

With a swift sidestep, he dodged, leaving Daniel stumbling forward like an uncoordinated insect, limbs flailing.

Isabella, still seething, bit her lip to suppress a laugh at the ridiculous sight.

Tilting his head, Alexander rubbed the back of his neck, his expression darkening with dangerous amusement. "That’s your idea of a sneak attack?"

"I may be sneaky, but at least I’m not the one acting like a thug in the middle of the night!" Daniel dusted himself off, still shaken by Alexander’s reflexes. "You’re divorced, yet you still lay hands on her. Is this how the CEO of Kingsley Group behaves?"

"And what exactly is your relationship with her?" Alexander’s gaze turned icy, his voice laced with menace.

This weak, sniveling man had the audacity to attack him—for her.

Clearly, he cared for her too.

Before Daniel could answer, Isabella spoke softly, "This is Daniel Carter. A neurosurgeon I brought from overseas."

A neurosurgeon.

Alexander understood immediately but said nothing.

"I came here for one reason," Isabella said, her tone clinical, detached—like a doctor assessing a patient. "Your condition."

That cold, indifferent look infuriated him.

"I’m not sick."

"Don’t lie to yourself. No one knows better than you how bad it is." Her gaze was steady. "After that head injury, even though I operated on you, the procedure wasn’t perfect. Now, when your emotions flare, your body trembles uncontrollably. If this continues, you’ll start hallucinating, fainting—eventually, paralysis. Do you really want that? Do you think your grandfather could bear seeing you like that?"

Daniel stared at her in disbelief.

She had performed Alexander’s brain surgery?

"Dr. Carter is one of the top specialists in the field," Isabella continued. "I brought him here specifically for your post-op recovery."

"Leave. I don’t need it." Alexander’s refusal was immediate, his voice flat.

"Do you think I’m here to negotiate with you?" Her eyes flashed.

"And do you think I’m here to negotiate with you, Isabella?" His gaze was glacial. "My life is none of your concern. Stay out of it."

"If you want to return to the party, go. If you’re only here to argue, then take him and leave."

With that, he turned and walked away without another word—as if they had never known each other at all.

"Bastard! Do you have a death wish?!" Isabella shouted after him.

He didn’t stop.

"Alexander! Stop!"

But his figure disappeared into the darkness.

Isabella stood frozen, the cold wind biting into her skin, seeping into her bones.

A crushing sense of loss settled over her.

"Once, someone offered me ten million dollars for a consultation," Daniel mused, leaning against a tree with a smirk. "I refused. And now, here I am, offering my services to Mr. Kingsley—only to be ignored." He chuckled. "Should I call him stubborn or just plain stupid?"

"Stupid," Isabella muttered, her eyes rimmed red.

"Yeah. Thought so. Just didn’t want to say it out loud."

Daniel watched her trembling silhouette, then asked softly, "Hey. Are you still in love with him?"

Her heart clenched as if pricked by a needle. "What did you say?"

"I asked if you’re still in love with Alexander."

"What’s it to you?"

"You are." His smile was knowing. "The fact that you didn’t deny it says everything."

"Daniel," she said slowly, turning to face him, "let me make one thing clear. I did love him. So much that I thought my heart would beat for him forever. Even if he never loved me back, I would’ve stayed by his side for life." Her voice wavered. "But now? All I feel is guilt. I just don’t want to owe him anything anymore."

With that, she forced a careless laugh and waved a hand. "Let it go. The past is the past."

Daniel’s smile faded.

He didn’t believe in love.

But if it existed, he respected it.

Meanwhile, in the underground parking lot.

Scarlett sat in the car, sobbing hysterically, her mascara streaking down her face.

"Enough!" Richard snapped, irritated. "Look at yourself—a pathetic mess!"

"I was humiliated in front of everyone! Can’t I even cry?!" She sniffled, wiping her tears. "Mr. Kingsley didn’t even help me up! He just walked right past me! That witch Isabella has him wrapped around her finger!"

Richard’s jaw tightened. He, too, had seen the way Alexander looked at Isabella—possessive, unapologetic.

"Dad, he’s still obsessed with her! What do we do?!"

"Obsessed? If he were, they wouldn’t be divorced," Richard scoffed. "Right now, Isabella isn’t your only problem. There’s also that girl from the Fairhaven family."

Scarlett’s stomach twisted at the mention of Evelyn.

Rumors swirled about Evelyn and Alexander’s secret hotel rendezvous—and whispers of a potential alliance between the Fairhavens and the Kingsleys.

But Evelyn? She was nothing.

Isabella, though—she was a blade hanging over Scarlett’s head, a constant thorn in her side.

"Yes, there’s her," Scarlett muttered. "I get it if Mr. Kingsley still wants Isabella, but Evelyn? Am I not even comparable to her?"

"You’re usually sharp, but now you’re being dense!" Richard clicked his tongue. "Alexander doesn’t want Evelyn. That hotel stunt was probably her doing—trying to trap him into marriage. If he really wanted her, why hasn’t he announced anything? This ‘alliance’ is far from settled."

Scarlett’s eyes lit up.

Her father was always right.

"If the Fairhavens can play dirty, so can we," Richard said, his gaze calculating. "Now’s the time to strike."

"Dad, what do you mean?"

"Sweetheart, you can’t catch a wolf without sacrificing the sheep. If you want Alexander, you’ll have to go all in."

Scarlett’s lips curved.

Pride? She had none.

Going all in? Absolutely.

"Dad, tell me what to do!"

Richard leaned in, whispering his plan.

Scarlett’s frown melted into a grin.

"Got it. To be Mrs. Kingsley, I’ll do anything."

Alexander returned to the party, his expression stormy.

Nathaniel approached, studying him. "What happened? Did you and Isabella fight?"

"We had nothing to say to each other." Alexander slumped onto a sofa, downing his champagne in one gulp.

The thought of her suffocated him.

His breathing grew ragged, his eyes burning.

"Man, you couldn’t even try to be nice? She agreed to meet you—that means she’s softened! Why didn’t you seize the chance to win her back? Or do you really want to marry Evelyn? Because I’ll be the first to object!"

"From the beginning," Alexander said coldly, "do you think I was the only one who did wrong?"

Nathaniel blinked. "Are you seriously blaming her?"

"I don’t know."

"Alexander, after everything she’s sacrificed for you, you have no right to resent her. If you love her, then she’s always right. Don’t argue with women—it’s pointless."

Before Alexander could respond, footsteps approached.

"Mr. Kingsley, Mr. Fairhaven, what a pleasure!"

They looked up to see Richard and Scarlett.

Alexander’s gaze turned arctic.

Nathaniel, ever the gentleman, stood with a polite smile. "I’m afraid I don’t recognize you. May I ask who you are?"

"Richard Ashbourne. Managing director at K Group." Richard grinned. "Though Mr. Kingsley might know our family better—given his past with my niece."

"Your niece?"

"My brother’s beloved daughter, Isabella. She’s my dear Scarlett’s cousin—they grew up together, very close!"

Nathaniel’s eyes widened.

So Richard was William’s brother?

Scarlett preened. The Ashbourne name did have its perks.

"Do you need something?" Alexander’s voice was ice.

Richard chuckled. "My daughter was a bit forward earlier. I brought her to apologize. But she’s not some reckless girl—I hope you won’t misunderstand, Mr. Kingsley."

"Mr. Kingsley," Scarlett said sweetly, clasping her hands, "I’m so sorry for my behavior earlier."
###Chapter 376

Nathaniel didn't even glance at Arabella. His fingers tightened around the whiskey glass as he took another sip, his voice detached. "Forget it. I'm not offended."

"Arabella, you must learn to control your temper." Dominic chastened his daughter sternly. "You're a Vanderbilt now. This behavior is unbecoming."

"Father, I was wrong." Arabella bit her lower lip, eyes glistening with unshed tears. "I'll learn from my cousin Isabella. If I work hard enough, surely she'll accept me one day? She wouldn't look down on me forever."

"Look down on you?" Nathaniel's frosty gaze snapped up, brows knitting together. "I was married to Isabella long enough to know her character. She's never looked down on anyone - not even the staff at Kingsley Manor. Why would she disdain her own cousin?"

Lucas nodded in silent agreement.

Nathaniel might be blunt, even harsh at times, but he was never unfair.

"That's not what I meant!" Arabella stammered, cheeks flushing crimson.

"I know Isabella, so I don't believe your implications." Nathaniel's piercing stare bore into her. "But I suggest you refrain from speaking about her this way to others - especially if your relationship is as close as your father claims." The warning in his tone was unmistakable.

Arabella panicked, shooting Dominic a desperate look.

"You can't even express yourself properly, making Mr. Kingsley misunderstand!" Dominic attempted damage control. "Arabella, apologize properly. And Mr. Kingsley, please forgive her youthful indiscretion for Isabella's sake?"

His obsequious manner was painfully obvious.

But Dominic had no choice. Without groveling, Nathaniel might walk away without hesitation.

Deep down, Nathaniel respected Reginald. As Isabella's uncle, Dominic deserved some courtesy for the family connection.

Just then, a waiter arrived with champagne flutes.

Arabella seized two glasses - one for herself, the other for Nathaniel.

"Mr. Kingsley, let me toast to you. I'll choose my words more carefully in future."

Nathaniel's glass happened to be empty. When Arabella offered the champagne, he accepted and drained it in one go.

Arabella smiled behind her own glass as she drank.

"Mr. Grant," Dominic turned to Lucas with sudden enthusiasm, "some K Group partners are very interested in your Grant Enterprises. Why not join us? There might be lucrative opportunities."

Lucas' eyes lit up at the prospect.

He wasn't just a connoisseur of beauty, but of wealth too. Business opportunities never escaped his notice. To compete with his uncle, he needed every advantage.

"Nathaniel, I'm heading over!"

With that, Lucas followed Dominic, leaving Nathaniel alone with Arabella. His expression remained stormy.

"Mr. Kingsley," Arabella fluttered her lashes hesitantly, "there's a dance later. Would you—"

Before she could finish, Nathaniel's glacial stare silenced her.

"You're aware I'm your cousin's ex-husband." His profile was sharp, intimidating. This was the first time he'd addressed her directly, yet the topic always circled back to Isabella.

"Yes, I know." Her voice wavered.

"Then you should know better than to behave inappropriately, especially in your cousin's presence. You shouldn't even approach me."

Arabella misinterpreted his words, cheeks flushing as she whispered, "Does that mean when Isabella isn't here, I can see you?"

"Under normal circumstances, we have no reason to meet. Don't delude yourself." Nathaniel finished his drink, gaze never warming.

Humiliation burned through Arabella. Her advances toward this unfeeling man were met with nothing but disdain.

She'd always been pursued, never the pursuer. This was the first time she'd lowered herself to chase a man.

But Nathaniel was worth it.

If she could become his woman, she'd never need her father or uncle's approval again.

As Nathaniel drank more, his condition deteriorated rapidly. Though known for his alcohol tolerance, tonight was different. After just a few glasses, his head swam, breath shortened, eyelids grew leaden. The ball had begun, but no one noticed the tension between him and Arabella.

Gasping, Nathaniel tugged at his Windsor knot, throat parched, cheeks flushed. Heat radiated from his core, teasing his nerves like phantom fingers.

"Mr. Kingsley, are you unwell?" Arabella feigned concern, though her lips curved secretly.

She knew the drug was taking effect.

Nathaniel leaned back, eyes closed, fighting the wildfire in his veins.

What was in that drink? The reaction was too intense.

Or was it Isabella who'd unsettled him, making him vulnerable?

"I'm fine. Not your concern." His tone remained icy.

"But you're burning up!" Boldly, Arabella pressed against him, her soft curves molding to his body as she reached for his forehead.

SMACK!

"Ah!" Nathaniel slapped her hand away violently, leaving an angry red mark.

"Don't touch me!" he roared through gritted teeth, eyes bloodshot. "Get out!"
###Chapter 377

His crimson gaze burned into her like molten lava.

Isabella Sinclair froze, her breath hitching in her throat. "Mr. Kingsley, I swear I didn’t mean any harm! I was just worried about you!"

Alexander Kingsley braced himself against the sofa, his muscles trembling as he forced himself to stand.

The moment he rose, the world tilted. A scorching heat surged through his veins, relentless and consuming.

His breathing was ragged, sweat glistening on his chiseled jaw. Even weakened, his raw magnetism left Isabella breathless.

Alexander staggered toward the exit, his body swaying as he leaned against the wall for support.

But Isabella wasn’t about to let this opportunity slip away. She followed him without hesitation.

Tonight was her chance.

If she could claim Alexander, no one—not Evelyn, not Edith—could stand in her way.

In the deserted hallway, she made her move, proving her father right—she had no shame.

"Mr. Kingsley, you can barely walk. Let me help you to your room," she purred, reaching for him.

"Get away from me!" Alexander snarled, shoving her back with what little strength he had left. His eyes blazed with fury, his disgust unmistakable.

As if she were something vile.

Frustration twisted her features. She lunged again, desperate.

"What the hell do you think you're doing?"

A cold voice sliced through the tension, startling Isabella into releasing her grip.

Daniel Carter stormed forward, his expression thunderous as he wrapped an arm around Alexander, putting distance between them.

"Ms. Ashbourne," he hissed, "care to explain yourself?"

Isabella straightened, but the Fairhaven heir’s aura was suffocating. A cold sweat broke across her skin. "Mr. Kingsley had too much to drink. I was just helping him."

"Drunk?" Daniel scoffed. "I know his tolerance better than anyone. He was fine before you showed up."

Her cheeks burned. "Are you implying I did something to him? My father is a respected man in K Group! I would never stoop so low!"

Daniel didn’t flinch. "Funny. Women with better pedigrees than yours have tried worse."

He turned his attention to Alexander, his voice softening. "You okay, man?"

"Get me out of here," Alexander rasped.

Daniel hauled him toward the exit, muttering under his breath, "See? You can live without a woman, but not without me."

"Wait!" Isabella called after them.

Daniel shot her a withering glare. "Give it up, Ms. Ashbourne. He’s not yours to have."

"Why not?"

"Because his heart belongs to someone else. And you? You’re not even in the same league."

"Evelyn?" she spat, her competitive fire igniting. "They’re divorced! If he loved her, why end it?"

Daniel laughed, cold and mocking. "You wouldn’t understand. Their marriage ended, but not his love. Even if Evelyn remarries, no one will ever replace her in his heart."

As they disappeared, Isabella’s legs gave out.

She screamed into the empty hallway, her voice raw with fury.

"I don’t believe you!"

Daniel shoved Alexander into the car, his jaw clenched.

It was obvious—Alexander hadn’t been drinking. He’d been drugged.

But how?

The waiter had brought a tray of champagne. Isabella had picked two glasses at random. Had she spiked them all?

"Damn," Daniel muttered, starting the engine. "I’m taking you to the villa. You can’t go home like this."

Alexander groaned, his fingers clawing at his collar. Two buttons popped off, revealing his flushed skin.

Daniel whistled. "No wonder they can’t resist you."

As he leaned over to fasten Alexander’s seatbelt, a name slipped from his lips—weak, desperate.

"Evelyn."

Daniel smirked. "Still denying your feelings, huh?"

He clicked the belt into place. "Don’t worry, buddy. I’ve got you."

Evelyn had just wrapped up her meeting when her phone rang.

Daniel’s name flashed on the screen. She almost ignored it, but the incessant ringing wore her down.

"What?" she snapped.

"Evelyn! Alexander’s in trouble!"

Her stomach dropped. "What happened?"

"I don’t know, but it’s bad. I took him to his villa. You’re a doctor—get over here!"

Her mind raced with terrifying possibilities. His lingering condition had always been her biggest fear.

"Send me the address."

She hung up, her knuckles white on the steering wheel.

Her companion, Preston, barely had time to protest before she locked the doors.

"I have to go. Call my brother."

The engine roared to life, leaving Preston gaping in the dust.

The villa loomed before her, stirring memories she’d tried to bury.

This was Alexander’s sanctuary—where he retreated when Windermere Estate suffocated him.

Alva had once told her, hoping to ease her loneliness.

But Evelyn had refused to come.

She knew why he stayed away.

Now, standing at the door, she hesitated.

The past pressed down on her—humiliation, heartbreak, the child she’d lost.

Acacia’s voice echoed in her mind. "He gave me this villa. Did he ever tell you?"

That night, she’d nearly bled to death.

But she’d survived.

She’d moved on.

Taking a deep breath, she rang the bell.

No answer.

Frowning, she pushed the door open.

It was unlocked.

Unease prickled her skin as she stepped inside.

The villa was cozy, nothing like the cold grandeur of Windermere.

"Daniel?" she called.

Silence.

She checked every room, her pulse quickening.

Finally, she reached the master bedroom.

The air was thick with heat, the scent of sandalwood and sweat intoxicating.

Through the half-open door, she heard labored breathing.

"Alexander?"

No response.

She pushed inside.

The room was dim, the bed a mess. Alexander lay sprawled, his shirt open, his skin flushed.

"Evelyn," he groaned, his voice rough. "I feel... awful."

She rushed to his side.

Suddenly, his hand shot out, gripping her wrist.

Her world spun.

In an instant, she was beneath him, his body burning against hers. His eyes—dark, desperate—locked onto her.

"Alexander, let go!"

"Someone drugged me," he panted. "I’m burning up."

Her fingers brushed his forehead. "You’re feverish!"

He caught her hand, pressing it back to his skin. "Touch me again."

His voice was raw, aching. "Evelyn... I’ve waited so long for this."
###Chapter 378

Isabella's breath caught as she met the man's burning gaze, her pulse racing uncontrollably.

There was something shattered in his eyes—a fragile desperation barely contained, a wildness barely restrained.

It was the same look that had ensnared her two years ago, on that unforgettable night when their bodies had tangled in passion. "Alexander, please—mmph!"

Her plea was swallowed by his searing kiss, fierce and possessive, like a starving predator claiming its prey.

His lips moved hungrily over hers, tasting, devouring, as if he wanted to consume her very essence.

He needed her. Craved her with a madness that bordered on obsession.

God only knew how he had survived these past months without her. Each day had been agony, a hollow existence devoid of meaning.

A soft whimper escaped Isabella as her body responded, heat flooding her skin, her breaths turning shallow.

Once again, she melted beneath him, her weak attempts to push him away only fueling his desire. Her hands pressed against his bare chest, but the gesture felt more like surrender than resistance.

No—truthfully, every glimpse of her, even in his dreams, was a temptation he couldn’t resist.

Lost in the intensity of his kiss, Isabella soon found herself drowning in him. Their lips moved together with such fervor that the slick, intimate sound of their passion filled the room.

Alexander’s rough hands traced up her thigh, exploring with bold possessiveness.

"No." Sweat-slicked and trembling, Isabella shoved him back.

"Isabella," he rasped, pulling away just enough to meet her gaze. His breath was ragged. "Help me."

His voice was raw, desperate. "I don’t want anyone else. Only you can save me."

Only you can save me.

Two years ago, she had been his salvation. His antidote. And now, even after everything, their fates remained entwined.

His kisses grew feverish, rough yet achingly tender as he trailed them down her throat, her collarbone.

Tears pricked Isabella’s eyes as she arched into him, her fingers tangling in his hair. The love in his touch was undeniable—so different from their first time.

Yes. She was falling for him all over again.

Once more, she surrendered, melting beneath him like spring thawing winter’s grip.

Their bodies moved together in perfect harmony, a dance of passion and longing.

By the time they were spent, Isabella’s body ached, her limbs heavy with exhaustion.

The aphrodisiac had turned him into an insatiable force, leaving her trembling and sore. Wrapping herself in a blanket, she sat up, her gaze lingering on Alexander’s sleeping form.

He still held her in his arms, his face breathtakingly serene.

Biting her lip, she reached out, tracing the sharp lines of his jaw. Her heart hammered wildly.

His forehead was cool now—the drug’s effects had faded.

With a quiet sigh, she slipped from the bed, gathering her scattered clothes. After a moment’s hesitation, she pulled on Alexander’s shirt.

When she had been his wife, she used to steal his clothes when he was away, wrapping herself in his scent.

She hadn’t expected to feel that same comfort now.

Assuming he wouldn’t wake soon, she padded to the kitchen for water, hoping to calm her still-racing heart.

Had he been celibate all this time?

Because what they’d just done hadn’t been lovemaking—it had been annihilation.

A faint smile curved her swollen lips as she drank, the cool water doing little to ease the lingering heat in her veins.

Curiosity led her to explore the villa.

The kitchen, the garden, the living room—each space was elegantly simple, yet warm.

She remembered Victoria’s taunts, claiming this was Alexander’s love nest for her.

Was it true?

She had just made love to him in what was once their home.

A sharp pang twisted in her chest, stealing her breath.

Heavy-hearted, she turned back toward the bedroom—only to wander into the study instead.

Her breath hitched.

An entire wall was covered in framed photographs.

Trembling, she picked one up.

A young boy with melancholy eyes stared back—Alexander as a child.

Beside him sat a stunning woman with captivating eyes—his mother.

Isabella exhaled softly. "So beautiful."

None of Emeric’s wives could compare. Only her own mother had ever rivaled such grace.

Men were fools. They never cherished what they had.

She studied more photos—Alexander and his mother, her portraits.

Then—

Her hands shook.

Victoria.

There, in a frame, stood a younger Victoria, laughing against Alexander’s shoulder in matching school uniforms.

They looked perfect together.

A bone-deep chill settled over Isabella.

She had thought Victoria was in the past. That she was beyond pain.

But this photo dragged her back into the vortex of heartache.

Meeting someone too dazzling in youth was a curse.

For her.

For Alexander.

Just then—

The door creaked open behind her.
###Chapter 379

The glass frame slipped from Isabella's trembling fingers, shattering against the hardwood floor.

Sharp fragments bit into her delicate skin, drawing tiny beads of crimson.

"Why are you here?"

Alexander's voice cut through the silence, deep and rough with sleep.

She didn’t turn. "I was just leaving."

He watched her from the doorway, his shirt hanging loose on her slender frame. Moonlight painted her in silver, making her look both ethereal and heartbreakingly fragile. His fingers twitched with the urge to pull her back into his arms.

His throat burned.

He’d woken in a cold sweat, reaching for her—only to find the bed empty.

Her dress still lay discarded on the floor. Her heels by the door. She hadn’t left. Relief had flooded him—until he heard the crash.

Now, the memory of last night burned behind his eyelids. The way she’d gasped his name. The way she’d clung to him.

Had he been too rough?

Had he hurt her?

Guilt twisted in his gut. He stepped forward.

Isabella turned sharply, trying to brush past him.

Alexander moved faster, catching her wrist. "Stay."

"You don’t get to tell me what to do."

"We slept together."

His grip tightened as he pulled her close. His gaze locked onto hers, unrelenting. "Isabella. We slept together. Don’t you have anything to say about that?"

"No." Her voice was ice. "Let go."

"I don’t take this lightly. Divorced or not, I won’t just walk away."

She laughed, cold and sharp. "It was one night. We’re adults. Move on."

With a sharp twist, she wrenched free. "Next time, Mr. Kingsley, watch who you let into your bed."

"Isabella!"

His hands clamped down on her shoulders.

"Don’t touch me!"

Her fists pounded against his chest, her voice cracking. The sound tore through him.

Was she crying?

Because of him?

He pulled her against him, ignoring her struggles. "I’m not letting you go."

"I don’t want your responsibility!"

Her tears seared his skin. "I hate you. I hate you so much."

"Then who else am I supposed to want?" His voice broke.

"If you cared about responsibility," she choked out, "why did you divorce me? Why didn’t you say this when it mattered?"

Alexander froze.

Her words struck like a blade.

She took advantage of his shock, biting down hard on his arm. He hissed, grip loosening—and she was gone.

The door slammed behind her.

Alexander stood there, her words echoing.

Then his gaze dropped to the shattered frame on the floor.

The photo of him and Natalia from years ago.

His stomach turned.

Isabella drove blindly through the city, tears blurring her vision.

The collision was inevitable.

Metal crunched. Glass shattered.

The other driver staggered out, pale-faced—until he saw her car. A limited-edition Aston Martin. His relief was palpable.

She didn’t move.

Her hands shook as she dialed the only person she trusted.

"Sebastian," she whispered when he answered. "I need you."

Twenty minutes later, his Rolls-Royce screeched to a halt.

Sebastian vaulted out, heart in his throat at the wreckage. His usually composed demeanor shattered.

Beside him, Nathaniel tensed, already scanning for injuries.

"Isabella!" Sebastian yanked open her door, hands skimming over her arms, her legs. "Are you hurt?"

"I’m fine," she whispered.

But her face was ghostly pale. Her eyes swam with tears.

Sebastian knew.

Something had broken her.

"Minor injuries," Nathaniel said quietly. "But we should check for a concussion."

Without a word, Sebastian lifted her into his arms and carried her to the car.

Nathaniel followed, something twisting in his chest as he watched Sebastian cradle her.

The Ashbournes were nothing like his own family.

They loved fiercely.

They fought for each other.

And right now, Isabella was breaking.

In the car, Sebastian held her close, murmuring reassurances.

"It hurts," she finally whispered, pressing a trembling hand to her chest. "Here."

Sebastian’s jaw clenched.

Only one man could destroy her like this.

Alexander Kingsley.
###Chapter 380

Barry Fairhaven had called Jareth into an urgent meeting when Thaddeus' frantic call interrupted. Without hesitation, Jareth excused himself, ignoring the bewildered stares of his colleagues as he bolted toward Sunset Ridge.

"What the hell—?"

Before he even reached the gates, thick plumes of smoke curled into the sky, turning his blood to ice. He sprinted inside, heart hammering.

Thaddeus stood in the backyard, methodically feeding items into a blazing metal barrel.

The flames cast eerie shadows across his ashen face, his expression hollow, like a marble statue amidst ruins.

Jareth's stomach dropped. "Thad? What are you doing?"

Before he could react, Thaddeus tossed another object into the fire.

A photograph.

Of him and Acacia.

"Did you bring me here after I was drugged?" Thaddeus' voice was eerily calm.

"Yeah. I knew this place was safe. Didn’t you used to come here all the time?" Jareth’s pulse spiked. "I couldn’t take you back to Windermere Estate in that state, and my place wasn’t an option. This was the only choice."

Thaddeus' eyes snapped open. "Did you call Evadne?"

Jareth swallowed. "You kept begging for her while delirious. I thought I was helping." His gaze darted around. "Wait—where is she? Did she leave?"

A deafening crash shattered the air.

Thaddeus kicked the barrel over, embers exploding like fireworks.

Jareth barely shielded his face in time, but the sparks still seared holes into his designer suit, singeing his hair.

"Jesus Christ, Thad! Are you trying to cremate me too?" He batted at the smoldering fabric.

Thaddeus swayed, sweat-drenched and trembling, his eyes burning with raw fury.

"How could you bring her here?"

"What’s wrong with this place?" Jareth demanded, baffled.

"This villa was a gift for Acacia." Thaddeus' voice cracked. "And you dragged Evadne into it. Were you trying to destroy her? Make her hate me?"

Jareth recoiled.

In all their years of friendship, he’d never seen Thaddeus unravel like this—never directed that rage at him.

Evadne meant everything to him.

"Thad, I didn’t know."

"I told Gordon to sell this place months ago." Thaddeus clawed at his hair, voice breaking. "All of Acacia’s things—I ordered them destroyed. If I’d known Evadne would see—"

His knees buckled.

Jareth lunged, catching him before he hit the ground. "Thad! What’s wrong? Are you sick?"

"Jareth." Thaddeus' fingers dug into the dirt, tears glistening. "The one thing Evadne couldn’t bear was my past with Acacia. When she saw those photos... it was over. We’re over."

"Bullshit!" Jareth’s throat tightened. "This is my fault! You’ve been drowning in work, barely holding it together. I should’ve handled this. I’ll fix it—I’ll explain to Evadne!"

Thaddeus gripped his arm, shaking his head with a broken laugh. "Explaining won’t erase how I hurt her."

Jareth’s breath hitched.

Was there anyone who suffered more in love than this man?

Upstairs, Thaddeus collapsed into bed, exhaustion swallowing him whole.

Jareth watched, gut twisting. The PTSD episodes were worsening. If this leaked, everything Thaddeus had built would crumble.

Gordon arrived, face drawn with guilt. "Mr. Fairhaven, I—"

"Not your fault." Jareth scrubbed a hand over his face. "I’m the idiot who screwed this up. But Evadne won’t even see me now."

"I’ll resign," Gordon said hoarsely. "If my failure cost Mr. Abernathy her forgiveness—"

"Don’t be stupid. He needs you." Jareth exhaled sharply. "Just keep this quiet. Especially from Hamilton."

Gordon nodded grimly.

Exhausted, Jareth returned to the penthouse he shared with Mari.

The moment the door opened, she launched herself at him, wrapping around him like a koala. "Jareth!"

"Call me honey," he murmured, kissing her flushed cheeks.

"Honey," she whispered, melting against him.

Their lips met, slow and deep, until Jareth carried her to the bedroom, stripping her gently before drawing a bath.

"I can do it myself," Mari protested weakly as he lifted her into the steaming water.

"Where’s the fun in that?" His hands slid over her curves, mischief glinting in his eyes.

Mari shivered. "Bathing with you is... exhausting."

"You don’t like it?" He feigned offense.

"I love it." Her shy confession reignited him.

Later, as he toweled her off, Mari studied his quiet expression. "Something’s wrong."

Jareth hesitated, then confessed everything—Thaddeus’ breakdown, Evadne’s rage, his own guilt.

Mari’s eyes widened. "Evadne and Thaddeus... they’ve been together before."

"What?"

"Two years ago." She bit her lip. "I saw her sneak into his room one night. He came home drunk, and... they didn’t leave until morning."

Jareth’s jaw dropped. "You never told him?"

"Evadne didn’t want him to know." Mari’s voice trembled. "She was terrified he’d despise her for taking advantage."

Jareth pulled her close, heart aching. "The bastard wronged her and doesn’t even remember."

"Can they fix this?" Mari whispered.

"They have to." Jareth kissed her hair, praying he wasn’t lying. "If she still loves him, there’s hope."

Ashbourne Hospital.
###Chapter 381

Evadne lay in the hospital bed, an IV drip attached to her arm. Exhausted in both body and mind, she stared blankly at the ceiling, unable to sleep.

Cassius sat beside her, cradling her foot in his lap as he carefully tended to the wound on her ankle with a cotton swab.

Only then did Evadne register the sting of pain. Her brows twitched slightly, but she remained silent.

"Evadne," Cassius murmured, his voice gentle but strained, "you didn’t come home to Elmsworth or Skyrim last night. Where were you?"

His hands trembled as he applied the ointment, but Evadne didn’t react.

"Did you go to see Thaddeus?"

The name hung in the air like a detonated bomb. Every time Cassius uttered it, he did so with caution. "Chasel said you took him to see Thaddeus yesterday, and it didn’t go well. Then you got a call and left alone. Did you go back to him?"

"Cassius."

After a long pause, Evadne finally turned her hollow gaze toward him, her voice raw. "I hate who I am right now. I feel so pathetic."

"Don’t say that."

Cassius’s chest tightened. He leaned in, pulling her into a fierce embrace. "No one gets to insult my sister. Not even you."

The bond between them was unbreakable.

All he wanted was for her to be happy.

Evadne buried her face in his shoulder, her body shaking with silent sobs. She didn’t understand why the sight of Thaddeus with Acacia had shattered her so completely.

It felt like her soul had been torn apart.

Just then, a nurse entered the room.

"President Ashbourne, it’s time to change Ms. Ashbourne’s dressing."

"Of course."

Cassius reluctantly released Evadne and stood, his expression heavy with worry.

The nurse helped Evadne out of her loose hospital gown, revealing a delicate silver silk slip beneath. Her skin was pale as porcelain, her arms fragile.

Though Cassius had cared for her when she was younger, she was a woman now, and he knew better than to stay during such a private moment.

As he turned to leave, his gaze caught on the vivid red marks trailing down her neck and collarbone.

His breath hitched.

In an instant, his entire body went rigid.

The nurse, sensing the shift in the air, quickly excused herself.

Cassius strode forward, gripping Evadne’s shoulders with bruising force.

"Did he touch you?" His voice was rough, barely controlled. "Did Thaddeus lay a hand on you? Did you two—?"

Evadne met his gaze, her lips dry and cracked.

Her silence was answer enough.

"Did he force you?" Cassius ground out.

"No." She swallowed hard. "I wanted to."

The words struck like a physical blow.

Cassius staggered back, his vision blurring.

When he finally left the room, his face was storm-dark.

News of Evadne’s accident had spread quickly. Arnold and Aaron, who had been working at Elmsworth, rushed to the hospital. Nydia, who had been in the middle of a meeting, dropped everything to come. Even Elvis, usually unshakable, arrived in record time.

For Evadne, the Ashbourne siblings rarely gathered like this. Only Bet, still stationed with the military, was missing.

"Cassius, how could Evadne have a car accident out of nowhere?" Nydia, the most sensitive of them all, was already on the verge of tears.

Jason watched her, aching to comfort her, but with the Ashbourne brothers present, he knew his place.

All he could do was stand silently, his gaze never leaving her.

"Exactly," Elvis muttered, running a hand through his hair. "Evadne’s a damn racing queen. She doesn’t rear-end people—people can’t even catch her taillights. Something’s off."

On the way here, his usual calm had deserted him. He’d faced criminals without flinching, but the thought of Evadne hurt left him paralyzed.

Arnold and Aaron exchanged uneasy glances, the tension in the hallway suffocating.

Cassius stood motionless, his jaw clenched so tight it looked painful.

"Cassius?" Arnold nudged him. "Say something."

"Evadne’s injuries aren’t serious," Cassius finally said, his voice flat. "Just some scrapes and bruises. She’s shaken, but she’ll be fine."

He took a slow breath, forcing himself to remain composed. "I need you all to take turns staying with her. Let’s not tell Dad or the others—they’re busy with Myra’s wedding. Evadne wouldn’t want to worry them."

"Cassius, cut the crap."

Elvis scowled. "She’s our sister. Of course we’re staying. You don’t even have to ask."

"Yeah," Arnold and Aaron chimed in immediately. "Nothing’s more important than Evadne."

"Arnold and Aaron, you both have work," Nydia said softly, glancing at Jason. "I don’t. I can stay with Jason to look after her. You guys should rest."

Their eyes met, an unspoken understanding passing between them.

"I’m free too," Aaron protested. "I already cleared my schedule."

He sighed, running a hand through his hair. "As her brother, I’ve never done enough for her. Now that she needs someone, I’m not leaving."

The Ashbourne siblings had never been like other wealthy families, tearing each other apart for power.

They stood together, their bond unshakable.

"Cassius," Arnold said slowly, his prosecutor’s instincts kicking in, "you’re asking us to stay, but what about you? Do you have something else to do?"

Something was off about Cassius. He was holding back fury.

"I have business to attend to."

Cassius glanced at the hospital room door, hesitating before stepping inside.

Evadne had been redressed and was lying still, eyes closed. It was impossible to tell if she was asleep.

Cassius’s throat tightened. He bent down, pressing a gentle kiss to her forehead.

"Rest, princess," he whispered. "I’ll be back soon."

"Cassius."

Evadne didn’t open her eyes, her voice barely audible. "I’m okay. Don’t worry about me."

Her forced strength cut deeper than any wound.

Cassius’s eyes burned, but he refused to let the tears fall.

He turned and strode toward the parking garage, his expression unreadable.

Just as he reached his car, Chasel’s voice stopped him.

"Cassius."

Cassius froze, then slowly turned.

The garage was dimly lit, but it was enough for Chasel to see the redness in Cassius’s eyes, the tears he couldn’t quite hide.

Something inside Chasel twisted.

Cassius, unaware of how devastatingly vulnerable he looked in that moment, straightened.

"What is it?"

Chasel stepped closer, his gaze intense.

Then, without warning, he reached up, brushing his fingers lightly over Cassius’s damp lashes.

Cassius’s breath caught.

"I get it," Chasel murmured, his voice low. "You’re worried about your sister. I understand."

His thumb traced Cassius’s cheekbone. "But don’t do anything stupid. Don’t make her worry about you. And don’t make me worry about you."

Cassius’s pulse roared in his ears.

"I know you’re busy," Chasel continued, stepping back with a smirk. "I won’t ask for a ride. I’ll just grab a rental. Know any good dealerships? Maybe you can hook me up with a discount."

Before he could finish, Cassius grabbed his wrist, yanking him forward.

Chasel’s eyes widened.

"I have time," Cassius growled, pulling him flush against his chest. "When we get back to Silveke Harbor, pick any car from the garage."

Thaddeus had been unconscious for two days, surviving on nothing but water.

Gordon hovered over him, frantic. He’d rather endure the pain himself than watch Thaddeus suffer like this.

Without Evadne, Thaddeus was a shell.

"Gordon, how is he?" Jareth’s voice crackled through the phone. "Is he awake? I’m coming over."

"Mr. Fairhaven, don’t bother. He took his meds and is sleeping."

"Are they meds or sleeping pills? He’s been out since he started. We need to get him to a hospital. I’ll arrange it—discreetly."

"No." Gordon’s voice was heavy. "Even Dr. Eve couldn’t help him. What can anyone else do?"

He stared at Thaddeus’s still form, his stomach churning. "I don’t know if these meds are worth it."

"What do you mean?"

"The side effects are brutal. They stop the shaking, but he vomits constantly, and he’s always drowsy. It’s just trading one hell for another. If this keeps up, he’ll be destroyed."

Jareth fell silent.

"Mr. Abernathy has done so much for Ms. Ashbourne," Gordon burst out, reckless in his frustration. "Why can’t she give him a chance?"

"Gordon."

Jareth sighed. "Evadne never wronged him. Thaddeus is paying for his sins. You saw those three years. You know what she endured. He should suffer for it."

Gordon’s chest ached.

He remembered Evadne—quiet, devoted, loving.

Tears spilled down his face.

Thaddeus was in agony.

But so was Evadne.

Gordon, unwilling to leave Thaddeus unattended, slept on the couch in his bedroom. The next morning, he jolted awake, his instincts screaming.

The bed was empty.

Thaddeus was gone.

"Mr. Abernathy?!"

Gordon bolted up, heart pounding, and tore through the house.

Then the bathroom door opened.

Thaddeus stepped out, impeccably dressed—tailored suit, polished shoes, every detail flawless.

He looked every inch the powerful CEO, nothing like the broken man of the night before.

"Something wrong?" Thaddeus adjusted his cufflinks, his voice rough but steady.

Gordon gaped. "Sir, you should be resting!"

"There’s a critical meeting today. I can’t miss it."

Gordon paled. "I forgot! But sir, you’re not well—"

Thaddeus silenced him with a look.

"I’m fine. Get the car."

At exactly ten a.m., a sleek Rolls-Royce pulled up to Abernathy Group’s headquarters.

The rare license plate drew whispers.

"That plate was auctioned for over two million!"

"Who the hell owns that?"

"Someone we’ll never meet."

Inside the car:

Cassius sat rigidly, a Bible open on his lap, a crucifix clutched in his hand.

When he finished praying, he closed the book with a quiet "Amen."

Then he looked up.

His eyes were bloodshot, burning with fury—like a demon unleashed.
###Chapter 382

The car door swung open with force.

Jason stepped out from the passenger side, his tailored teal-gray suit sharp against the morning light. His piercing gaze swept across the entrance of the Abernathy Group, indifferent to the admiring glances from female employees.

Without hesitation, he opened the rear door and bowed.

"President Ashbourne, we've arrived."

Cassius emerged, his expression unreadable, a statue carved from ice. The moment his polished shoes touched the pavement, whispers erupted.

"God, he's breathtaking. That face could launch a thousand fantasies."

"Greedy much? You're already dreaming about Mr. Abernathy every night."

"Please, they're completely different. Mr. Abernathy is devastatingly handsome, but this man? He's the kind of dangerous that makes your pulse race without even trying."

"Who is he? Why is he here?"

Cassius ignored them all, striding toward the entrance with Jason at his heels. Their presence alone seemed to thicken the air, pressing down on those around them.

At the reception desk, Jason spoke first, voice like steel. "We're here for Mr. Abernathy."

The receptionist blinked. "Mr. Abernathy?"

No one just walked in demanding to see the CEO.

"Do you have an appointment?"

"No."

"Then I'm afraid—"

Cassius cut her off. "Tell Thaddeus that Cassius Ashbourne, CEO of K Group, is here."

The name hit like a thunderclap.

The receptionist scrambled for the phone.

Before she could finish dialing, Cassius and Jason were already stepping into the elevator, ascending to the executive floor.

Security blocked their path at the corridor.

"Mr. Abernathy is in a meeting. You can't go in."

Cassius didn't slow. "Move."

When the guards reached to stop him, Jason struck—two precise blows sent them crashing to the ground.

"Pathetic," Jason muttered, rolling his shoulders. "If this is the best Thaddeus has, no wonder he's losing his grip."

Cassius walked past without a glance.

Gordon burst from the conference room, face dark. "President Ashbourne! You can't just—"

Cassius grabbed his arm, twisted, and shoved him aside. Gordon hit the floor with a cry, his shoulder dislocated.

The conference room doors flew open.

Every executive froze as Cassius stepped inside, his presence slicing through the tension like a blade.

Thaddeus didn't look up from his papers. "Meeting adjourned."

The room emptied in seconds.

Only the three of them remained, the air thick with unspoken fury.

Cassius spoke first. "You touched my sister."

Jason's breath caught. His hands curled into fists.

Thaddeus finally met his gaze. "I'll marry her. If she'll have me."

A bitter laugh escaped Cassius. "You think she'd ever choose you again?"

Jason couldn't hold back. "You lost that right the day you divorced her! How dare you lay a hand on her now?"

Thaddeus's jaw tightened. "What's done is done."

Cassius moved like lightning.

One second he was across the table—the next, he had Thaddeus pinned to the floor, a dagger glinting at his throat.

"President Ashbourne!" Jason shouted.

The blade pressed deeper, drawing blood.

Then—

"Cassius! Stop!"

Jareth crashed into them, shoving Cassius back. The knife grazed Thaddeus's neck, leaving a crimson trail.

Jareth panted, gripping Cassius's wrist. "If you kill him, what then? Will Evadne thank you for it?"

The name was a tether. Cassius's grip loosened.

He stood, sheathing the dagger. "You're not worth the blood on my hands."

As he turned to leave, Thaddeus spoke again, voice raw.

"I'll marry her. If she says yes."

Cassius didn't look back. "She'd rather burn the world than take you back."

The door slammed shut behind him.
###Chapter 383

The whispers spread like wildfire through the skyscraper—Cassius Ashbourne, CEO of the K Group, had made an unexpected visit to the Abernathy Corporation.

Jareth supported a visibly weakened Thaddeus back to the office, with Gordon following close behind, concern etched on his face.

Thaddeus's arm was dislocated, the pain so excruciating it had drenched his shirt in sweat. Yet he hadn’t uttered a single complaint.

Jareth had sensed something was wrong and discovered Gordon’s injury. Despite Gordon’s protests, the staff rushed him to the hospital for treatment.

"That Cassius," Jareth muttered, shaking his head. "Always so composed and refined. Who knew he could turn into such a brute?"

It had been terrifying.

"He did it for his sister. I understand that," Thaddeus rasped, slumping onto the couch, his head falling back in exhaustion.

If someone had hurt Evadne, Thaddeus knew he would have reacted even more violently than Cassius.

The memory of Cassius’s parting words sent a chill through his veins, freezing his blood.

"Fair enough. If it were Mari, I wouldn’t have stayed calm either."

Jareth’s gaze lingered on the shallow knife wound on Thaddeus’s neck. The cut wasn’t deep, but the blood had stained his pristine white shirt a stark crimson. "You should get that checked."

"It’s nothing," Thaddeus breathed.

"Why did Cassius turn on you like that?" Jareth asked, his brow furrowed with worry.

"He found out Evadne and I were intimate."

Jareth let out a dry chuckle. "So in Cassius’s eyes, Evadne isn’t just his sister anymore—she’s practically his daughter. You’re lucky he didn’t come in guns blazing."

Thaddeus clenched his fists. "It’s my fault. After the divorce, I shouldn’t have touched her."

His voice cracked as he dragged his hands through his hair. "But Jareth, I couldn’t control myself. That night, she was right there—so close. All I could think about was possessing her."

Possessing her. Owning her. Making her his.

Jareth winced, recalling Mari’s words. "Thad, I don’t blame Cassius for wanting to kill you. What you did to Evadne was monstrous."

Thaddeus stiffened. "What are you talking about?"

"Two years ago, you took Evadne’s virginity—and you don’t even remember it. What kind of beast does that?"

Thaddeus’s eyes flew open. His hand shot out, gripping Jareth’s wrist. "Is that true? Who told you?!"

He had doubted Evadne’s words that day, but the truth was too devastating to accept.

"Mari saw everything."

Jareth sighed, relaying Mari’s secret.

Thaddeus’s mind reeled. The shock was so intense he nearly blacked out.

They had been intimate.

Why hadn’t Evadne told him?

She was so foolish. So unbearably foolish.

"Mari is reliable. If you don’t believe anyone else, believe her." Jareth shook his head. "Honestly, I’m amazed you don’t remember sleeping with a woman. That’s just bizarre."

"I don’t know. I don’t remember."

Thaddeus pressed his palms against his temples, his chest aching with regret. "It was the anniversary of my mother’s death. I drank too much. I kept dreaming of being with Evadne. I thought they were just dreams. I never imagined they were real."

Jareth’s expression darkened. "Two years ago, you were still involved with Acacia. You told me you’d get back with her and divorce Evadne because she meant nothing to you. Remember those heartless words, Thad? You confided them in me."

Each word was a dagger to Thaddeus’s heart. He slumped forward, images of Evadne’s tear-streaked face flashing in his mind.

What had she thought when he took her virginity?

How much had she loved him to endure such torment and still stay by his side?

He deserved to die.

Cassius’s dagger should have gone deeper.

"Thad, I think you’ve loved Evadne for a long time. But you didn’t understand love—or how to love. Acacia manipulated you, using your childhood guilt to control you. That’s why you couldn’t accept Evadne or your own feelings."

Jareth exhaled, torn between anger and sympathy. "I came here today to tell you this. I was going to convince you not to give up on Evadne—to fight for her. But after seeing Cassius’s reaction, I think some things just aren’t meant to be. You two are star-crossed. Forcing it will only bring more pain."

Too many obstacles stood between them.

Jareth couldn’t bring himself to push Evadne to forgive Thaddeus. It felt like torture.

"Jareth."

Thaddeus’s voice was hollow, his eyes aged with pain. "I need to see Evadne. I need to apologize."

Avery Chambers had rushed to the hospital the moment he heard about Evadne’s accident.

"Mr. Chambers," Harvey reported eagerly, "President Ashbourne stormed into the Abernathy Corporation today and confronted Thaddeus. It was chaos—some staff got hurt."

Avery’s eyes narrowed. "Oh? What happened?"

"Details are scarce, but President Ashbourne is fiercely protective of his sister. This was clearly about Evadne."

Avery’s expression darkened.

Had Evadne’s accident been connected to Thaddeus?

Something must have happened to make the usually composed Cassius lose control.

"Regardless," Avery murmured, a smirk playing on his lips, "this works in my favor. Cassius once favored Thaddeus over me. Now that they’re at odds, I might even have the advantage."

"Of course you do," Harvey sneered. "How can that illegitimate bastard compare to someone of your standing? Thaddeus is just Frederic’s pawn. If he weren’t useful, the Abernathy Corporation wouldn’t even spare him a glance."

Avery’s gaze flickered with something unreadable.

After a pause, he asked, "Any updates on that man getting close to Elsie?"

Harvey paled. "I—I couldn’t find anything. His records are sealed tight."

Avery arched a brow. "Interesting."

His lips curved, but his eyes remained cold. "Keep watching Elsie. I don’t want her causing trouble."

At the hospital, Avery and Harvey were blocked by Cassius’s bodyguards.

"Do you know who Mr. Chambers is to Ms. Ashbourne?" Harvey snapped. "Even if you don’t, you should know the relationship between the Ashbourne family and the Chambers Group!"

The bodyguards remained unmoved.

Avery adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses, his smile fading.

Just as he was about to speak, a lazy voice cut in.

"All this talk about relationships sounds like a tongue twister."

Avery looked up—and froze.

The man from the club. The one who had been with Elsie.

Who was he, and why was he here?

Elvis Waverley leaned against the wall, hands in his pockets, his sharp gaze locked on Avery.

"So, what is Mr. Chambers’s relationship with my sister? I’m curious."

Avery’s fists clenched.

Sister?

Did he mean Evadne?

"May I ask your name?" Avery forced a polite smile.

"Waverley." Elvis tilted his chin slightly. "Elvis Waverley."

Avery’s blood ran cold.

Evadne’s mysterious brother.

The one no one ever talked about.
###Chapter 384

Elvis's lips curled into his signature rebellious smirk as he subtly studied Avery.

That night at the bar, the woman who looked eerily like his sister had slipped away into a Chambers family car.

The alley was pitch black, the car's interior unlit. Elvis couldn't make out the man inside clearly.

But as a top agent, his observational skills were razor-sharp. The silhouette alone gave him seventy percent certainty—the man beside Ms. Archer that night had been Avery.

"Elvis, what a pleasure to finally meet you." Avery's expression shifted effortlessly into a warm, charming smile as he extended the greeting first.

"Oh? You know me?" Elvis arched a brow, mildly surprised.

"Evadne and I have been close since childhood. My father and Mr. Ashbourne were good friends. I practically grew up at your house."

Avery spoke smoothly, his tone unhurried. "Mrs. Ashbourne has five children. Evadne has four older brothers, while you and Bet took your mother's surname."

Elvis narrowed his eyes, waiting.

"Bet Waverley—I've met him. He's serving in the military now. But you? Never had the chance."

Avery smiled lightly. "Doesn't matter. You're Evadne's brother. That makes you family to me too."

"You're well-informed about my family." Elvis tilted his head, amused. "Seems you've done your homework."

"Anything about Evadne, I make it my business to know." Avery's gaze gleamed with sincerity.

Elvis had already heard from Arnold—Avery Chambers was head over heels for Evadne.

As her brother, he'd naturally keep tabs on her suitors. He wouldn't let history repeat itself, not after the disaster with Thaddeus.

But something about Avery unsettled him.

Thaddeus deserved to be blacklisted forever, but Avery? He wasn't quite right either.

And that night at the bar...

Even if he wasn't a hundred percent sure it was Avery, the doubt gnawed at him.

"Elvis, I heard about Evadne's accident." Avery stepped closer, urgency lacing his voice. "I need to see her. Please."

Before Elvis could respond, a soft voice interrupted.

"Elvis."

He turned to see Nydia closing the hospital room door, approaching them with light steps.

"Is Evadne asleep?" Elvis asked quickly.

Nydia pressed her lips together, shaking her head. Then, glancing at Avery, she said, "She thought she heard Mr. Chambers. She wants to see him."

Avery's eyes brightened instantly.

"If Evadne wants it, then go ahead." Elvis stepped aside, his tone indifferent.

"Thank you, Elvis."

Avery's smile remained warm as he brushed past Elvis and entered the room.

The moment the door shut, Elvis pulled Nydia aside.

"What's really going on between Avery and Evadne?"

Nydia tapped her lips thoughtfully. "Childhood sweethearts? Innocent schoolmates?"

Elvis's eyes widened. "Seriously?!"

"It's true. In primary school, they were inseparable. Avery was always getting bullied, and Evadne was the one who protected him. Later, Mr. Jeff brought Byron and Avery to our house. Mom said he wanted to arrange a marriage between Evadne and one of them."

"Did Emeric agree?" Elvis pressed.

Nydia shook her head. "No. From what I heard, Dad wasn't impressed with either Chambers boy. But Mr. Chambers seems determined—like Evadne's already his daughter-in-law."

Elvis scoffed. "In his dreams. Evadne's a goddess. Marrying her off to any Chambers would be a crime. At least Emeric has taste."

Nydia smiled faintly.

Inside the room, Avery approached Evadne's bed with quiet steps.

She sat up weakly, her gaunt face twisting his heart.

He was a man of schemes, guilty of unforgivable deeds.

But his love for Evadne? That was real.

In this lifetime, he'd marry no one but her. Fifteen years hadn't changed that.

"Ave, you came." Evadne blinked away her daze, offering him a tired smile. "Thank you for visiting. Have a seat."

She gestured to the couch, but Avery wanted to be closer.

He ached to hold her, to kiss her.

Instead, he sat beside the bed, his voice rough with emotion. "Where are you hurt? Does it still hurt? What happened?"

"Just scratches. Nothing serious." Her eyes were clear but shadowed. "Shame about my limited-edition car, though. Probably totaled."

"Who cares about a car?" Avery reached for her hand, his grip warm and firm. "I'll get you any car you want. Even if there's only one in the world."

He'd give her anything.

Evadne pulled her hand back, unease flickering in her gaze. The rejection stung.

Why?

Thaddeus was out of the picture. Why wouldn't she even consider him?

Was he that unworthy?

"Evadne—"

"Avery, thank you for caring." Her voice was soft but final. "But I'm done with love. Now or ever. Don't waste your time on me."

Night deepened in the hospital corridor.

Nydia, exhausted from the day, dozed off against Elvis's shoulder.

Startled at first, he didn't dare move.

Growing up, he'd never considered his half-siblings family.

But time and shared hardships had softened him.

When Nydia woke, embarrassed by the drool on his shirt, Elvis only smiled.

"Elvis, I'm so sorry! I'll wash it—"

"Don't worry about it." He patted his thigh. "Here. More comfortable."

Nydia blushed furiously. "I can't."

"Evadne used to sleep like this all the time."

She hesitated, fingers twisting nervously.

Elvis understood—she was too timid, too unsure of her place in his life.

With a sigh, he draped his trench coat over her shoulders.

"Elvis, I'm not cold—"

"Keep it." His voice gentled. "If you really see me as your brother."

Tears welled in Nydia's eyes. Thanks to Evadne, she had a brother who cared.

A noise echoed down the hall.

"Nydia, wait here." Elvis stood, his expression hardening as he walked toward the sound.

When he saw Thaddeus and Jareth, his blood ran cold.

Jareth recognized Elvis instantly—the man who'd once beaten Thaddeus senseless.

"Damn, it's him!"

"You've got nerve showing your face here." Elvis's muscles coiled, his voice a lethal whisper. "Get lost. Now."

Thaddeus's face was pale, his eyes bloodshot. "I need to see Evadne. I have to talk to her."

"She's got nothing to say to you."

Thaddeus stepped forward, desperate. "I'm not leaving until I see her."

As he tried to push past, Jareth struck—a stun baton to Elvis's lower back.

Elvis crumpled, paralyzed.

"Sorry, mate. Just rest a bit." Jareth smirked, twirling the baton. "Had to play dirty with you Ashbournes."

Thaddeus sprinted to Evadne's room, only to be blocked by Nydia.

"Let me see her." His voice cracked.

Nydia studied him, then sighed and stepped aside.

"If you knew it'd come to this, why start at all?"

Thaddeus froze, his chest heaving.

Inside, Evadne's face turned to ice the moment he entered.

Avery shot him a venomous glare.

"Get out." Evadne's voice was steel.

"I came to apologize." Thaddeus's throat worked. "For two years ago. For hurting you. I'm sorry."

Avery frowned. Two years ago? Before the divorce? What had happened?

Evadne's entire body trembled. Then, in a flash, she hurled a water glass at Thaddeus.

He didn't dodge.

The glass shattered against his forehead, blood welling instantly.

"Who wants your apology?!" Her scream tore through the room. "We're over! Stop torturing me!"
###Chapter 385

Why had he come here to discuss this with her?

Why had he apologized?

What she wanted from him was never an apology. It was something far deeper, something he had never truly understood.

Disappointment and shame coursed through Evadne’s body, making her tremble with fury.

She wasn’t one to cry easily, but now, the tears wouldn’t stop.

Avery had never seen Evadne like this—broken, vulnerable. The confident, spirited woman he knew was crumbling before his eyes. "Evadne, please," he whispered, his voice thick with concern.

Without hesitation, he pulled her into his arms, letting her collapse against him.

Her body was weak, her head resting heavily on his shoulder as her tears soaked through his shirt.

Avery’s heart raced, a quiet satisfaction curling at the edges of his lips.

For the first time, he felt needed. Wanted.

Thaddeus watched, his chest caving in as if struck by a wrecking ball.

He stumbled back, pressing against the wall, his entire body numb.

"Thaddeus, aren’t you leaving?" Avery’s voice was ice.

"If you truly care about her, you’ll walk away. Every second you stay just rips open old wounds. She’s finally free—don’t drag her back into the past."

Thaddeus didn’t remember leaving the room.

The bruise on his forehead stood out starkly against his ashen skin, as if all the life had drained from him.

He couldn’t face Jareth now.

All he wanted was to disappear.

The stairwell was dark, silent.

He sagged against the wall, his tall frame buckling under the weight of his grief. Then—light.

The door swung open, harsh fluorescent beams cutting through the dimness.

Thaddeus straightened instantly, masking his turmoil.

"Still here? Persistent, aren’t you?"

Avery stood before him, smirking. "You saw what happened. She doesn’t need you. She needs me." His smile sharpened. "But I should thank you. If you hadn’t broken her heart, she never would’ve turned to me."

Thaddeus clenched his jaw, refusing to engage.

Just the sight of Avery made his blood boil.

Once, he would’ve thrown a punch without hesitation.

But now?

What right did he have?

As he moved to leave, Avery’s voice stopped him. "Why did you apologize? What did you do to her two years ago?"

Thaddeus froze, his vision blurring.

Memories flooded him—her skin against his, her breath hitching as he whispered I love you against her ear.

She had melted into him, soft and willing.

She never said the words, but he knew.

Back then, there was still hope.

And he had destroyed it.

His chest ached, tears burning behind his eyes.

"You really want to know?" His voice was raw.

"Of course. As the man who’s loved her for fifteen years, I deserve to know everything."

Thaddeus stared at him, eyes dark as a storm.

Then, slowly, he smiled—cold, humorless. "Two years ago, when she was still my wife, we slept together."

Avery’s face twisted in shock.

"Evadne has been mine for a long time."

"You bastard!"

Rage exploded in Avery’s chest. His fist flew toward Thaddeus’ face—

Only for Thaddeus to catch it effortlessly.

His grip was iron.

"Evadne can hit me. She can stab me. I’d let her." Thaddeus’ voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "But you? You don’t get to touch me."

With a sharp twist, he threw Avery back, sending him crashing into the wall.

Avery gasped, pain shooting through his wrist.

He had underestimated Thaddeus.

"You’re still fighting for her, aren’t you?" Avery laughed, low and dangerous. "Do you really think you can win?"

"I’m not fighting you." Thaddeus’ gaze was steel. "If you love her, I won’t stand in your way."

Because he had failed her.

If someone else could make her happy, he would let go.

"But remember this, Avery." His voice turned deadly. "I’ll be watching. Cross a line, and I’ll destroy you."

The door slammed behind him, the sound final.

Avery adjusted his glasses, his angelic face twisting into something dark.

With a roar, he drove his fist through the glass of the fire extinguisher box.

"Thaddeus," he hissed. "The price for challenging me is death."

Jareth waited outside the hospital, chain-smoking.

When Thaddeus emerged, pale and hollow-eyed, Jareth called out—

But Thaddeus walked right past him, silent.

The car ride was suffocating.

"Gordon said the villa’s been sealed," Jareth murmured. "Everything’s been packed—your mother’s photos are safe. The rest is gone."

No response.

"Thad? Are you listening?"

"I’m not going home." Thaddeus’ voice cracked. "Take me to my grandfather. I need to see him."

Jareth’s breath caught.

Thaddeus was crying.

In twenty years, he had never seen him shed a tear—not even at his mother’s funeral.

But for Evadne?

He was shattered.

Cassius drowned himself in wine, hidden away in his cellar.

"Mom," he whispered, swirling the dark liquid. "I failed her. She’s hurting. Tell me—how do I fix this?"

The door creaked open.

Chasel leaned against the frame, smirking.

"You shouldn’t drink alone."

Cassius’ heart stuttered.

For a second, he saw him.

Chasel sat beside him, pouring a glass. "You’ll ruin your liver."

"Since when do you care?"

"I always have." His fingers brushed Cassius’ hand, lingering. "You’re not married yet. Shouldn’t you take better care of yourself?"

Cassius scoffed. "I’m not getting married."

"Why not?" Chasel’s eyes gleamed. "You’re the Ashbourne heir. The future of K Group."

"That belongs to Evadne."

Chasel arched a brow. "You’d give up everything for her?"

"Everything."

Chasel leaned closer, his breath warm against Cassius’ skin. "Then what’s stopping you from loving someone else?"

Cassius stiffened.

"I’ve loved before," he said quietly. "And because I have, I won’t do it again."

Chasel’s gaze darkened.

Before Cassius could react, Chasel kissed him—hard, possessive.

Cassius’ glass slipped from his fingers, wine spilling like blood.

Emeric’s phone rang the moment he landed.

"Avery?"

"Evadne was in an accident. She’s in the hospital."

Emeric’s world tilted.

"Why wasn’t I told?!"

"She didn’t want to worry you."

"That foolish girl!" Emeric’s voice shook. "Where is she?"

"I’m outside the airport," Avery said smoothly. "I’ll take you to her."

A pause.

"There’s something else we need to discuss."
###Chapter 386

Emeric delivered the news to the triplets, who were visibly stunned. They all insisted on accompanying him to visit Evadne, but he refused, adamant on going alone.

After much persuasion, he finally convinced them to stay behind and sent them back to their homes in Skyrim.

Emeric stepped out of the airport, flanked by his secretary, Mr. Dn, and a bodyguard. True to his word, Avery stood waiting beside a sleek luxury car, tall and composed.

"Mr. Emeric, it's good to see you." Avery greeted him with a warm smile and a respectful bow.

After a brief hesitation, Emeric slid into Avery’s car, while his bodyguard and secretary followed in their own vehicle.

Avery had mentioned he had something important to discuss—something concerning Evadne.

Under normal circumstances, someone of Avery’s standing wouldn’t even get an audience with a man of Emeric’s influence, despite being Jeff’s son. But when it came to Evadne, Emeric couldn’t afford to ignore it.

The car glided smoothly toward the hospital.

"Mr. Emeric, I’ve been by Evadne’s side these past few days," Avery said, his voice heavy with sorrow. "Her mood has been unstable—deeply depressed. I’ve known her for years, but I’ve never seen her like this. If you saw her now, it would break your heart. I know how much you care for her."

Emeric felt as though an arrow had struck him, the pain unbearable.

It was no secret that among all his children, Evadne was his favorite. No one else came close.

Hearing that his daughter was suffering was like having his heart ripped out and fried in agony.

And Avery knew exactly how to play this.

He knew Evadne was Emeric’s greatest weakness.

"Avery, tell me," Emeric demanded, his voice tense. "What happened while I was away? What trouble has Evadne gotten into? Who reduced my daughter to this state?"

"Mr. Emeric, who else could break a strong woman like Evadne?"

Avery clenched his fist, his eyes turning icy. "Who hurt her? Who discarded her with his own hands? Who keeps tormenting her, reopening her wounds?"

"Thaddeus?" Emeric’s thick brows furrowed deeply.

"There’s no one else it could be."

"Did that bastard have anything to do with Evadne’s car accident?"

Avery adjusted his glasses, his expression grave. "All I know is that on the day of the accident, Evadne went to see Thaddeus. Whatever happened between them left her so distraught that she lost focus on the road. The car was totaled, but thankfully, she wasn’t seriously injured."

"What will it take for him to leave my daughter alone?!" Emeric slammed his fist against the car door, his rage uncontrollable.

"There’s something else, Mr. Emeric. I don’t know if I should tell you." Avery hesitated.

"Tell me! Whatever that bastard has done to my daughter, I want to know everything!" Emeric’s eyes burned with fury, his entire body trembling.

Avery’s gaze darkened, and in a low voice, he recounted how Thaddeus had taken advantage of Evadne when she was unconscious.

He was clever. From Thaddeus’s apology that day to Evadne’s reaction, and their interactions since, he had pieced together enough of the story.

Even the gaps he didn’t fully understand didn’t matter.

Whatever Thaddeus couldn’t bring himself to say, Avery would fill in the blanks.

Emeric listened in silence, not uttering a single word.

Only his heavy, hate-filled breathing echoed in the dimly lit car.

"Mr. Emeric, please don’t let this upset you too much. Your health comes first." Avery’s voice was laced with concern.

"That Abernathy boy," Emeric seethed, clutching his chest. "How much more does he intend to torment my daughter?"

His heart ached as if it were bleeding.

"Though Evadne has suffered in the past, what matters is that it’s behind her now. From this moment on, I will protect her."

Avery’s gaze locked onto Emeric’s, burning with sincerity. "I swear, all my love belongs to Evadne. I will make her the happiest woman in the world. Mr. Emeric, my love for her has nothing to do with her being your daughter, or any ties to the Chambers Group or the Ashbourne Group. I love her for who she is. Since childhood, no other woman has ever come close to her in my heart. Never."

Emeric stared at him, shocked by the raw earnestness in his eyes.

Before, he had harbored resentment toward Avery and the entire Chambers family. He had never believed in arranged marriages, and he didn’t want Evadne trapped in a loveless union.

But now, it seemed Avery truly loved her.

As a man who had loved deeply himself, Emeric recognized the genuine devotion in Avery’s gaze.

Perhaps it was time to stop indulging his daughter’s whims.

She had always claimed she was pursuing happiness, but what had it brought her? A man who couldn’t control his desires—a scoundrel.

"Avery Chambers."

Emeric rarely addressed him so warmly, but his tone was firm. "You know my daughter’s situation. She once loved Thaddeus with all her heart, gave him everything. It may take years—decades—for her to heal. No matter how sincere or passionate you are, she may never return your feelings. Evadne is my daughter. I know her best. Can you endure that? For ten, twenty years? Will you still stand by her then? Will you regret it?"

"I know Thaddeus still holds her heart. But I don’t care."

Avery’s eyes glistened with tears, his voice breaking. "I want to marry Evadne. No matter what she’s been through, it doesn’t matter to me. The only woman I love is her."

Emeric’s brows furrowed. It would be a lie to say he wasn’t moved.

"Mr. Emeric, I’m asking for your blessing. Give me a chance to be with her."

By the time they reached the hospital, Evadne was asleep.

Emeric had so much to say, but seeing her pale, fragile face, the words died on his lips. He simply sat beside her, silent. What more was there to say?

There was no going back. Any further words would only wound her again.

Early the next morning, Cassius and Arnold arrived.

"Dad, you should go home and rest. Evadne will be discharged tomorrow. We’ll take her home," Cassius said gently.

"I’m not tired." Emeric’s tone was cold, his resentment palpable.

"Dad, we were wrong to keep this from you."

Arnold sighed deeply. "But we did it for your health. You’ve raised us. Isn’t it our duty to protect you when it matters? We can handle Evadne’s situation."

"Handle it? If you could handle it, my daughter wouldn’t be lying here in pain." Emeric scoffed.

Cassius’s expression darkened, and he said nothing.

Arnold pressed his lips together, uncharacteristically speechless.

"Cassius, come with me. We need to talk." Emeric stood stiffly, his back aching from sitting too long.

"Yes, Dad."

Cassius quickly moved to support his father, and they left the ward.

In the lounge, Emeric dropped a bombshell.

"You want Evadne to be with Avery? Why?" Cassius was stunned, his pupils contracting.

"If we truly want Evadne to move on from Thaddeus, the best way is for her to start anew—with someone who truly loves her."

Emeric’s gaze was resolute. His mind was made up. "Avery is devoted to her. Our families are well-matched. I’ve known him since he was a boy. I trust his character. Let them try. Maybe he can heal her heart. She can’t go on like this. She needs a fresh start."

"Do you really know Avery? Do you trust him that much?"

Cassius’s voice grew heavier with urgency. "Avery has been involved in shady dealings under Helgen’s command—things that wouldn’t stand scrutiny. Are you comfortable letting Evadne be with him?"

"That’s overseas, not here. And if he treats her well, I don’t mind helping him clean up his act."

"Dad!" Cassius choked on his anger. "How can you change your stance so suddenly? Evadne won’t be happy with this!"

"And if I don’t, will she ever be happy?"

Emeric stood abruptly, his eyes blazing. "I’ve never interfered with her choices—not when she became a doctor, not when she pursued her dreams. I gave her freedom. And where has it gotten her? A failed marriage. A broken heart. Torment. Even now, Thaddeus takes advantage of her! Is my daughter worthless? Just because she left him, does she deserve to be alone forever?"

Cassius was speechless.

He realized Emeric knew about the unspeakable things between Evadne and Thaddeus.

But aside from the two of them, only he knew. He hadn’t told his father. So how had he found out?

Who had told him?

"The youngest son of the Chambers family may not hold power in the Chambers Group, and his relationship with Jeff may be strained. Right now, he’s not the ideal match. But if he truly loves Evadne, I’ll support him."

Emeric’s rage simmered as he thought of Thaddeus’s sins against his daughter. "Thaddeus Abernathy’s days as the golden boy of the Elmsworth family are numbered."

Cassius was frustrated.

Emeric’s tone made it clear—he intended to groom Avery as his future son-in-law.

"Did you even ask Evadne about this? Would she agree to you meddling in her love life?"

"No need to ask."

Emeric waved a dismissive hand. "In time, she’ll understand. The man she loves isn’t right for her. Only someone who truly loves her is worth a lifetime. At least this way, she won’t be hurt again."
###Chapter 387

The steaming bathwater had finally eased the tension in Isabella's muscles. She examined her surgical scars in the mirror, satisfied with their healing progress. A glass of rich red wine was exactly what she needed now.

"Margaret? Margaret!" Isabella called out sharply.

The maid, Eleanor, rushed in immediately. "Yes, Ms. Isabella?"

Ever since Evangeline had assigned her to spy, Eleanor had been working tirelessly to gain the trust of both Isabella and Arabella. While Arabella remained suspicious and distant, Isabella proved far more gullible—easier to manipulate.

So Eleanor made herself indispensable, catering to Isabella's every whim. Otherwise, as a low-ranking maid who once served under Margaret, she would have been thrown out of the Sinclair Estate without hesitation.

"Fetch me a bottle from the wine cellar. Something expensive," Isabella ordered, smoothing a sheet mask over her freshly enhanced features. Eleanor nodded and hurried off.

Then Isabella realized she'd left her phone in the third-floor theater room. She couldn't function without it, so she had no choice but to retrieve it herself.

As she walked down the dimly lit hallway, a shadow flickered past. Isabella gasped, nearly dropping her mask. A few steps ahead, a pale woman with tangled hair emerged from the darkness.

Isabella exhaled in relief. "Mother? Is that you?"

Arabella, hunched and wrapped in a cashmere shawl, peered at her through unkempt strands. Isabella was stunned—her once-elegant mother looked like a ghost of herself.

Arabella suddenly seized Isabella's arm, dragging her back to the bedroom.

"Mother, what's wrong? You're hurting me!"

"Quiet!" Arabella hissed, silencing her with a venomous glare.

Once inside, Arabella locked the door and scanned the room frantically. "Mother, what happened?" Isabella pressed, anxiety clawing at her throat.

Arabella collapsed onto the sofa, shivering despite the warmth. "I made a mistake tonight. I said something I shouldn't have."

"What? What did you say?"

"I went for another treatment. Dr. Laurent gave me an injection—said it would relax me better than my usual medication." Arabella's voice trembled.

"I fell asleep. When I woke up, he asked me about Seraphina!"

Isabella's blood ran cold. Goosebumps prickled her skin.

"Mother, what did you tell him? Who is this Dr. Laurent? How could you—"

The truth about Nathaniel's mother's death wasn't a secret to Isabella. In many ways, Arabella had orchestrated Seraphina's suicide.

Arabella had manipulated Seraphina's maid into tampering with her antidepressants, spread vicious rumors, and ultimately driven her to jump from the balcony.

It was Arabella's proudest achievement—one she could never boast about.

"I don't know how much I revealed. I don't even remember what I said." Arabella's eyes were glazed, her voice unsteady. "But Dr. Laurent swore confidentiality. He won't betray me."

"Mother! How can you trust him? He's not family—what if he blackmails you?"

A faint rustling sound cut through the tension. Isabella tiptoed to the door and flung it open—but the hallway was empty. She exhaled shakily, her forehead damp with sweat.

If anyone had overheard, it would mean ruin for both of them.

"He would never betray me! He works for me!" Arabella insisted, though her confidence wavered.

But what choice did she have? She was utterly dependent on Dr. Laurent now—emotionally and physically.

"Mother, listen to me." Isabella gripped Arabella's icy hands. "You need to distance yourself from him. He's dangerous. And Seraphina's death? That secret dies with everyone who knows it. As long as he's alive, he's a threat to you."

"It's been twenty years. All evidence is gone."

Arabella shuddered, curling into Isabella's arms. "Unless that wretched Seraphina rises from the grave to accuse me, no one will ever know the truth."

"What about Genevieve?"

"She's nothing! A discarded pawn. If she ever dares return to Elmsworth, she'll keep her mouth shut if she knows what's good for her."

Arabella's breathing steadied, her rationality returning. "That maid—the one I bribed, Seraphina's loyal servant. Have you been monitoring her?"

"Yes. She runs a diner in R-town. She owes us. She won't talk."

Isabella's expression darkened. Though she resented Arabella at times, she understood their fates were intertwined. If Arabella fell, Isabella's life in the Sinclair family would crumble. The entire Sinclair Group would fall into Nathaniel's hands—and she'd be left with nothing.

After helping Arabella back to her room, Isabella returned to hers, shaken.

The sight of needle marks on Arabella's arms haunted her. With Reginald and Arabella barely sharing a bed since the incident with Margaret, their marriage was hanging by a thread.

Eleanor stood waiting with the wine. Isabella snatched it and slammed the door in her face.

Eleanor remained frozen, her uniform damp with sweat.

Alone, Isabella had no appetite for wine.

Dr. Laurent's name gnawed at her. She needed to investigate him—discreetly.

After removing her mask and washing her face, she opened her wardrobe to change. A strange scent hit her—someone had been inside.

She grabbed her phone and pulled up the hidden surveillance feed.

Her blood turned to ice.

Foolish as she was, Isabella had installed cameras in her room.

The footage showed Eleanor entering shortly after she'd left—hiding first in the room, then in the closet.

Isabella's phone clattered to the floor.

That wretched maid had heard everything.

She knew the truth.

Trembling, Isabella paced, her mind racing. She snatched up her phone and dialed Arabella.

"What is it? I was about to sleep."

"Mother, we have a problem!"

Isabella huddled on the bed, voice shaking. "Eleanor overheard us. She was hiding in my closet. The cameras caught her!"

Silence.

"Mother? Did you hear me? What do we do?"

"That maid cannot stay."

Arabella's voice was glacial. "Act normal for now. Don't alert her. Watch her closely. When the time comes, we'll make her disappear—permanently."

Evangeline was finally discharged from the hospital.

The entire Ashbourne family came—even the three aunts flew in from Skyrim, though Elijah refused to see Reginald. Seeing their beloved Evangeline so frail, the women wept.

"My dear, you've suffered," Margaret murmured, pulling Evangeline into a tearful embrace. "We failed you. I'm so sorry."

"The fault is mine," Evangeline whispered, bitterness swelling in her chest.

"How have you been? Has Reginald treated you well? Bought you bags? Jewelry?" Evangeline teased weakly. "He's not that stingy, is he?"

"Margaret isn't materialistic, but she did bring back enough gourmet ingredients to cook for you for a month," Seraphina chuckled, arm around Sophia.

"What? I'm not an invalid!" Evangeline protested, though secretly touched.

Across the street, Nathaniel stood alone in the shadows, his gaze fixed on Evangeline.

Her smile—once his to cherish—now felt like a distant dream.

He'd canceled an important meeting to be here, yet all he could do was watch from afar, like a ghost haunting his own life.

Pain lanced through his chest, sharp and unrelenting.

How had it come to this?

Was it Genevieve's fault? Adrian's?

No. The blame was his alone.

"Evangeline," he whispered, stepping forward involuntarily.

Just then, a vintage Rolls-Royce pulled up—Reginald's prized possession, one of a kind in the country.

Mr. Donovan stepped out first, opening the rear door.

Evangeline expected her father—but the man who emerged was impeccably dressed, his presence commanding.

Adrian.
###Chapter 388

The moment Isabella stepped out of Alexander's Rolls Royce, the Sinclair family froze in shock.

Eleanor's brows knitted together in disbelief.

Alexander Kingsley was notorious for his impeccable standards and icy demeanor.

Apart from his own children, no one—not even Sebastian, the most powerful among the Vanderbilts—had ever been granted the privilege of riding in his car.

Yet here was Isabella, not only sharing his vehicle but standing shoulder-to-shoulder with him. The sight was nothing short of astonishing.

If Eleanor's memory served her right, Alexander had been downright dismissive of Isabella just days ago. What could have caused this dramatic shift?

"Isabella, you're looking much better. I'm so relieved," Eleanor finally broke the tense silence.

With warmth sparkling in her emerald eyes, Isabella approached Eleanor holding a bouquet of vibrant pink peonies. "To celebrate your discharge from the hospital."

Eleanor blinked at the fresh blooms, momentarily speechless.

"Thank you," she murmured, accepting the flowers.

"I picked these at dawn from the greenhouse. They reminded me of you—radiant and resilient." Isabella's sincerity shone through her words.

The Sinclair siblings exchanged loaded glances, sensing the charged atmosphere.

"That's... very thoughtful of you." Eleanor's grip tightened around the stems, her lips parting slightly as her gaze grew distant.

"I'd do anything for you." The intensity in Isabella's voice made Eleanor's breath hitch.

Eleanor bit her lower lip, at a loss for words.

This unexpected declaration hit harder than the fragrance of the peonies.

Sebastian watched their interaction, his throat burning with a bitterness that tasted like copper.

Then his chest constricted.

Alexander emerged from the vehicle, standing protectively beside Isabella like a father presenting his prized heir.

Isabella smiled up at him with effortless familiarity, blending seamlessly into the Sinclair dynasty.

When Alexander patted her shoulder approvingly, Sebastian's vision tinted red. His fist collided with a nearby oak tree.

He couldn't stomach this!

But what could he do? Storm over and upset Eleanor further?

He'd rather die than cause her more pain.

"Thought you were made of tougher stuff," a mocking voice drawled behind him. "Turns out you're just punching trees like some lovesick teenager."

Sebastian turned slowly to meet Oliver's derisive smirk.

"The mighty Sebastian Vanderbilt, reduced to a pathetic spectator." Oliver's contempt dripped like venom. He'd always loathed Sebastian, and now made no effort to hide it. When it came to protecting his sister, Oliver recognized no moral boundaries.

Anyone who hurt Eleanor was lower than scum in his eyes.

"I know I shouldn't be here," Sebastian rasped, eyes bloodshot. "But can't I at least look at her from afar?"

He hadn't slept properly in days, surviving on stolen glimpses until dawn.

It felt like his heart was being slowly shredded.

Oliver narrowed his eyes, joining Sebastian in observing Eleanor. "Let's be clear—I fucking hate you."

Sebastian's lips pressed into a thin line.

"But I also can't stand Isabella. My sister deserves better than either of you." Oliver spat on the ground. "First Alexander acts all high and mighty about standards, now he's practically shoving them together. If he tries to arrange their marriage, I'll crash the damn wedding myself!"

Sebastian blinked.

He'd heard of jealous exes disrupting weddings, but angry brothers?

Then again, Oliver had always been recklessly unpredictable.

"Listen up, asshole." Oliver jabbed a finger at Sebastian's chest. "Hypothetically—if Isabella actually marries my sister someday, would you have the balls to object?"

The question felt like a knife twisting in Sebastian's ribs.

Isabella and Eleanor—married.

The mere thought made him physically ill.

"Forget it!" Oliver snarled. "Neither of you deserve her! You're both worthless!"

"I just want Eleanor to be happy," Sebastian whispered hoarsely. "I'd sacrifice anything for that."

"Then help me break them up," Oliver demanded through gritted teeth. "I can't watch this charade anymore!"

Sebastian stared at him, stunned.

"Don't flatter yourself—this isn't for you." Oliver's jaw clenched. "Eleanor can't see what I see. There's something off about Isabella. I won't let my sister be manipulated."

Sebastian gave a barely perceptible nod.

"Then it's settled. We sabotage this... whatever it is." Oliver cracked his knuckles ominously.

"And if she truly wants to be with Isabella?" The question tore Sebastian apart as he asked it.

"Based on fifteen years of knowing Eleanor? Not happening." Oliver's laugh was ice-cold. "I know what she looks like when she's in love—better than anyone."

Sebastian swallowed hard, cheeks burning with shame.

He knew exactly what Oliver meant.

Once, Eleanor had loved him with her entire being—fervent, unconditional devotion.

He'd held paradise in his hands and squandered it through arrogance and blindness.

"That's why we act now," Oliver continued. "Before whatever this is takes root. Nip it in the bud."

His eyes darkened. "If we wait, even stone erodes under constant dripping. You in or not? Not that you have a choice—our motto's always been 'if I can't have her, no one can.'"

With that, Oliver turned to leave.

"Are you helping me because of our boarding school days?" Sebastian suddenly asked.

Oliver paused, eyebrow arched. "Took you long enough to remember. But no—that's ancient history. See you around, Vanderbilt."

During the return journey, Alexander insisted Eleanor ride with Isabella—a blatant matchmaking ploy.

Meanwhile, the Sinclair siblings crammed into one car, buzzing with theories.

"Is Father actually playing cupid?" Arabella gasped. "God, if this works out, Isabella's hitting the jackpot. Marrying into the Sinclair empire? She'd be living every gold-digger's dream!"

"The Lockwoods are old money," Margaret pointed out dryly. "Hardly gold-digging material."

"But Eleanor's always been hung up on Sebastian," Seraphina interjected sharply. "Has she really moved on so quickly?"

"Best way to get over someone is to get under someone new," Arabella quipped.

"What's bizarre," Margaret mused, "is Father's sudden change of heart. He always said the Lockwood boys were unremarkable. Why the about-face?"

Margaret's delicate features tightened.

The Lockwood heir was proving more cunning than anticipated.

In the other car, Eleanor stared resolutely out the window, making no effort to converse.

Isabella sat quietly beside her, drinking in her presence like a man starved.

Just being near her was intoxicating.

"You've barely left my side this whole week," Eleanor finally said, still not looking at him. "You must be exhausted. Rest at home—no need to visit for a while."

"Don't you want to see me?" Isabella's voice cracked.

Eleanor turned then, her gaze cool. "I don't know what you told Alexander, but if you value our friendship, let this end here. There's no future with Sebastian—or with you."

"Isabella, I swear I didn't—"

"Fifteen years have passed," Eleanor cut him off. "I'm not your childhood savior anymore. Cherish the bond we have—don't destroy it. If you persist, I'll have no choice but to cut ties."

Each word landed like a dagger, leaving Isabella's heart in tatters.

His pale hands clenched unseen.

'You're breaking my heart, Eleanor,' he thought bitterly. 'How can you be so cruel?'

The tense silence shattered when Eleanor's phone buzzed.

Seeing Adrian's name, her pulse spiked. She answered in hushed tones.

"Ms. Eleanor! Can you meet tonight? It's urgent!" Adrian's whisper was frantic. "I'm at the Vanderbilt estate—can't talk freely here!"

Eleanor checked her watch. "I'll come to you."

Isabella watched intently, though her words were too soft to decipher.

"No! Too dangerous!" Adrian insisted, voice trembling. "I'll come to you—just name the place!"

"Texting you now." Eleanor hung up quickly.

Troubled, she massaged her temples. "Change of plans—drop me at The Chateau Royale instead."

Isabella's expression crumpled. No matter how hard he tried, an invisible barrier kept Eleanor forever out of reach.
###Chapter 389

Erica's footsteps echoed nervously through the rose garden after ending the call with Evadne.

Her hands trembled. Never in her twenty years of service had she dared such treachery.

The mansion loomed before her like a gilded prison. She took a steadying breath and stepped inside.

Her heart stopped.

Thaddeus Kingsley stood in the grand foyer, his tailored suit cutting an imposing silhouette against the marble.

"Mr. Kingsley!"

The words tumbled out before she could stop herself. Sweat beaded on her brow as she approached the master of the house.

Though she'd polished every inch of this estate, she'd never directly addressed its owner. Yet today, desperation made her bold.

Thaddeus arched an aristocratic brow. "Yes?"

"I...that is..." Her tongue turned to lead. The damning words lodged in her throat.

"Speak freely." His voice held unexpected patience - a change she attributed to Evadne's influence.

Erica's nails bit into her palms. Should she reveal everything now? Expose Elspeth's murderous secret?

Would this powerful man believe a lowly maid over his own stepmother?

She edged closer, voice dropping to a whisper. "Sir, tonight I'm meeting Ms. Evadne at the Windsor Café. Could you—"

"Erica!" Glynnis's shriek shattered the moment.

Erica whirled to see her mistress glowering from the balcony, face twisted in suspicion.

Thaddeus noted the maid's sudden pallor. Interesting.

"Hurry up! My new wardrobe won't organize itself!" Glynnis snapped.

"Yes, Miss Prescott!" Erica bobbed a curtsy.

As she turned, Thaddeus stepped close enough for his cologne to sting her senses. "Gordon will contact you," he murmured. "Give him the location."

The maid's quarters felt like a sanctuary after Glynnis's chambers. Erica folded silk blouses with robotic precision while her mistress lounged like a pampered cat.

"What were you whispering about with my brother?" Glynnis swirled her merlot, eyes sharp as broken glass.

Erica kept her voice steady. "Mr. Kingsley requested a bottle of Château Lafite for his study."

"Liar." The wineglass hit the table with a crack. "My brother has staff for such errands. Unless..." A cruel smile curled her lips. "You think you can climb into his bed?"

Relief flooded Erica at the baseless accusation.

"Know this, servant." Glynnis leaned forward, venom dripping from each word. "Cross me, and you'll regret it."

"Yes, Miss Prescott."

"Good." Glynnis stretched like a satisfied predator. "I'm dining out tonight. Don't wait up."

Erica nearly dropped the Dior gown in her hands. Divine intervention!

"Consider this your night off." Glynnis waved a dismissive hand.

"Thank you, Miss Prescott."

The door hadn't fully closed before Glynnis snatched her phone. "Mother, I've set the trap."

Elspeth's voice turned glacial. "Explain."

"Erica's clearly working for someone. By giving her freedom tonight, we'll catch whoever's pulling her strings!"

"Idiot child!" Elspeth's roar made the phone vibrate. "The only enemies we have are Thaddeus and that Abernathy girl! What if she meets Evadne tonight?"

Glynnis's blood ran cold.

"Erica knows everything!" Elspeth hissed. "If she talks, we're finished!"

The wine turned to acid in Glynnis's stomach. Her brilliant plan now seemed monumentally stupid.

"Cancel your plans." Elspeth's command brooked no argument. "That maid doesn't leave this house alive."
###Chapter 390

Thaddeus retreated to his private study, waiting for Gordon's arrival.

The words the young maid had whispered to him lingered in his mind. Standing by the window, cigarette smoke curling around him, his gaze was dark and unreadable—yet his pulse hammered violently in his chest. So, she had been in secret contact with Evadne all this time?

Why?

Evadne, what were you planning? Why did you always manage to unsettle him like this?

A sharp knock at the door shattered his thoughts. Thaddeus exhaled smoke, flicking ashes from his cigarette with rough fingers. The door swung open, and Gordon strode in, shutting it firmly behind him. He extended a folded note with both hands.

"Mr. Thaddeus, this is the address Erica gave me. She'll be meeting Ms. Evadne there tonight."

Thaddeus' fingers tightened around the cigarette, the paper trembling slightly in his grip.

He took the note, scanned the address, and committed it to memory.

"What else did she say?"

Gordon shook his head. "Sir, I suspect she might be a spy planted by Ms. Evadne within the Abernathy household."

"Of course she is," Thaddeus rasped, crumpling the note in his fist.

Evadne—always moving pieces behind his back, manipulating events right under his nose.

"What does Ms. Evadne want?"

Gordon's eyes lit up. "Wait—could it be she still has feelings for you? Maybe she left a spy to keep tabs on you! If that's true, then Mrs. Abernathy still cares, sir! That's fantastic news!"

Thaddeus shot him a withering glare, the smoke he exhaled thick with exasperation.

He wasn't arrogant enough to believe Evadne would go to such lengths over lingering affection. The Ashbourne heiress was ruthless, ambitious—she didn't waste time on sentiment.

There was only one explanation.

Something within the Abernathy estate had caught her attention—something she couldn't ignore.

Was it about Myra? Was she still plotting revenge against Elspeth?

If so, why had Erica exposed their plan to him today? They could have kept it hidden.

Unless they wanted his help.

Thaddeus' eyes darkened, a surge of protectiveness igniting in his chest.

"Sir, should I accompany you tonight?" Gordon asked, concern lacing his voice.

Thaddeus shook his head. "No. Erica only invited me. That means they don't want others involved."

Gordon hesitated. "But what if Mrs. Abernathy doesn't know you're coming? If this is just Erica's idea, she might be furious when she sees you."

"Then I'll follow from a distance."

The hardness in Thaddeus' gaze softened at the thought of Evadne. "She’s always stirring trouble. I can’t take my eyes off her."

At precisely nine o'clock, Glynnis slipped out of Windermere Estate through the back door, dressed in black, a baseball cap pulled low over her face.

The moment her cab disappeared into the night, a sleek black car emerged from the shadows.

"Ms. Glynnis, should we tail her?"

The driver—Elspeth's most trusted enforcer—spoke in a monotone. His loyalty was unquestionable, his hands stained with blood from years of dirty work. Tonight, he was at Glynnis' disposal.

"No need. Tonight, that traitor gets what she deserves. If we follow too closely, we risk being caught on camera." Glynnis smirked, having learned well from her mother.

"Understood. I'll await Madam's signal." Mr. Ward replied mechanically.

"How do you plan to handle it?"

Glynnis tilted her head, feigning indifference. "Is Mother planning to make her disappear temporarily—or permanently?"

"Madam prefers permanent solutions."

"How ruthless."

"Without ruthlessness, would you be living this life, Ms. Glynnis?"

Glynnis' lips twisted in irritation.

Elspeth schemed because she had to—to climb from mistress to matriarch.

But Glynnis was different. She was Frederic's blood, the true Abernathy heir.

She was sick of being called foolish.

This time, she'd prove herself.

"Mr. Ward, I have an idea." She leaned forward, malice dripping from her words. "Instead of stopping Erica, why not let her meet Evadne? Then we take them both out at once."

Mr. Ward studied her. "And you're certain Erica is Evadne's spy?"

"Absolutely. Thaddeus wouldn't stoop to this. And if she were his, why risk sneaking out?"

A slow nod. "So you want me to eliminate Evadne?"

Glynnis' heart raced—fear, excitement, anticipation.

Killing Evadne was a fantasy she'd savored.

But Evadne was Emeric Ashbourne's daughter. If she died, he'd burn the world to find her killer.

Yet tonight—Evadne was vulnerable.

"Do you dare?"

Mr. Ward smirked. "I've killed before. One more means nothing."

Glynnis' eyes gleamed. "Then tonight will be Evadne's last."

Evadne and Jason waited in the deserted west district park.

With her status, public meetings were risky—Erica’s safety was paramount. Jason checked his watch, tension coiling in his muscles. "She's late. Something's wrong."

Evadne frowned.

"Miss, do you think Erica found something crucial about Elspeth?"

"We'll know when she arrives."

Footsteps—frantic, uneven—echoed through the darkness.

"Ms. Evadne! Run!"

Erica stumbled toward them, face pale, sweat soaking her back. "They followed me! They know you're here! Go—now!"

Evadne caught her, grip firm. "I won't let them hurt you."

Before she could finish, shadows closed in.

Jason moved instantly, shielding them, fists clenched.

Erica trembled, but Evadne stood firm, eyes locked on the three men in black.

Their leader—Mr. Ward—stepped forward.

Evadne assessed him instantly. A killer.

"Who are you?" Jason snarled.

Mr. Ward ignored him, staring at Evadne. "You must be Ms. Evadne."

"I am."

"Beautiful. A shame."

Evadne's blood boiled.

Audacious bastard.

"So Elspeth sent you to kill me?"

"You meddle in affairs that aren't yours. Now you pay."

Evadne laughed—sharp, fearless. "Then make sure you kill me. Because if you fail, I'll make sure you—and whoever hides behind you—die screaming."

Mr. Ward chuckled. Empty threats.

"Miss, go!" Jason urged.

Evadne shoved Erica away. "I'm staying."

Jason met her gaze—fierce, unyielding.

Loyalty beyond death.

Erica turned to flee—only to find two more men blocking her path.

Trapped.

"Make it quick." Mr. Ward tilted his head. "I'll handle Evadne myself."

Jason lunged, fists flying. But outnumbered, outmatched—blood sprayed as blades found flesh.

A knife buried in his shoulder, twisted viciously.

Jason screamed.

Evadne snapped an assailant's arm, snatched his blade, and drove it into another.

Mr. Ward watched, amused.

She was impressive. A pity.

Evadne fought toward Jason—then froze.

Cold steel pressed against her back.

"Miss!" Jason roared.

The dagger rose—death descending.

A black Lamborghini screeched to a halt.

Thaddeus stormed toward the park, phone pressed to his ear.

"Gordon, send backup. Now."

The call had come from Erica—cut short by a scream.

Evadne was in danger.

His heart pounded.

Fate bound them—whether by love or war, he couldn't say.

But he wouldn't let her die.
###Chapter 391

"Ms. Isabella!"

Evelyn, pale with terror, squeezed her eyes shut in panic.

Isabella felt her world collapse in that instant. Her pupils contracted violently, her heart turning to ashes.

Time seemed to freeze.

Memories of Alexander flashed before her eyes like a flickering film reel—their electrifying first encounter thirteen years ago, the battles they fought side by side in Zenithia, their wedding, their divorce, and the rare moments of solace they shared.

A shuddering breath escaped her, tears spilling down her cheeks.

They said in the face of death, one’s truest emotions surfaced. Was she thinking of Alexander because she still loved him—or because she hated him too much?

A sharp whistle of wind sliced through the air.

But the fatal blow never came.

Mr. Ward staggered back, his wrist exploding in pain as the knife was kicked from his grip, clattering into the pool.

Isabella whipped her head around.

And there he was.

Alexander stood before her like an avenging god, his icy demeanor cutting through the chaos. The moment their eyes met, the ruins of her shattered gaze ignited into wildfire. Her heart hammered, unshed tears burning behind her lashes.

He had come.

He had actually come.

Alexander’s breath hitched as his gaze locked onto hers—brief, intense, searing. Then his eyes dropped to the blood staining her arm, and fury erupted in his chest. His fists clenched so tight his knuckles turned white.

Mr. Ward, a man who killed without blinking, felt his blood run cold under that murderous glare.

But what terrified him more was Alexander’s sudden appearance.

Alexander stepped forward, shielding Isabella like an impenetrable fortress. "I recognize you. You work for Elspeth, don’t you?"

Isabella’s breath caught. Jason, slumped on the ground, seethed silently.

She could understand Elspeth wanting her dead. But what she couldn’t fathom was why Elspeth would act so recklessly now, after maintaining their fragile truce for so long.

Unless... Elspeth’s real target was Evelyn?

But why? Had Evelyn uncovered something damning?

The remaining three thugs exchanged panicked glances. There was no turning back now.

"Elspeth? Never heard of her," Mr. Ward sneered, massaging his throbbing wrist. "But it doesn’t matter. None of you are walking out of here alive."

He dared to threaten Isabella.

Alexander’s lips curled into a lethal smile. "I was going to let you surrender. But since you laid a hand on my woman—now, I just want your life."

His woman.

Heat flooded Isabella’s cheeks.

But there was no time to dwell on his words. Alexander lunged at Mr. Ward, their brutal exchange sending shockwaves through the air.

The three thugs closed in, knives aimed at Alexander’s vitals.

"Alexander! Behind you!" Isabella’s voice was raw with fear, her body drenched in cold sweat.

She knew he wasn’t at full strength. Taking on Mr. Ward alone was dangerous enough—now, with three more attackers, the odds were impossible.

And they fought dirty.

Alexander didn’t even turn. He caught the nearest thug’s wrist and twisted—hard. A sickening crack echoed, followed by a scream.

Isabella’s heart pounded as she watched him move with lethal precision. The fearless soldier from Zenithia had returned.

He drove the knife into the man’s abdomen—swift, brutal, but deliberately missing vital organs.

Even after years of luxury, his combat skills hadn’t dulled.

"Was it you?" Alexander’s voice was a deadly whisper, his grip tightening on the bloodied knife. His eyes burned with storm-dark rage. "Did you cut her?"

Mr. Ward bared his teeth in a sneer.

"If she loses a single hair, I’ll break your legs. If she sheds a drop of blood, I’ll take your life." Alexander’s chest ached at the sight of Isabella’s wound.

But he couldn’t look at her. One glance might shatter his control.

Isabella’s lips trembled, emotions churning inside her.

Mr. Ward’s smirk turned sinister.

Chaos wasn’t enough. He needed certainty.

His hand slid to his waist, fingers closing around cold metal.

The gun’s muzzle locked onto Isabella’s face.

He hadn’t used it earlier to avoid attention. But now?

Bang!

A gunshot shattered the night.

"NO!" Alexander’s scream tore through the air.

Isabella braced for impact—

—only to hear a weak gasp.

Her eyes flew open.

"Evelyn!"

Evelyn stood before her, arms outstretched, before crumpling like a broken doll.

Alexander and Jason froze.

Isabella caught her, her palm instantly slick with warm blood. Trembling, she lifted her hand—and sobbed.

"Evelyn!"

"Ms. Isabella..." Evelyn’s voice was a fragile whisper, her lips barely moving. "Listen... Elspeth... killed Alexander’s mother. The proof... is on my phone..."

Ice speared through Isabella’s chest.

She looked up at Alexander, who had just disarmed Mr. Ward. Sirens wailed in the distance.

Seeing his escape cut off, Mr. Ward plunged into the pond.

Alexander fired twice—click. Empty.

The water swallowed Mr. Ward whole.

"Evel—Evelyn, stay with me!" Isabella pressed her coat to Evelyn’s wound, tears streaming.

But she knew.

As a doctor, she knew.

"Evadne!"

Gordon led the Abernathy security team, followed by her brothers, Elvis and Aaron.

"Evadne!"

She barely heard them. Her world had narrowed to Evelyn’s fading pulse.

Cassius reached her first, clutching his cross.

Gordon moved to support Alexander but paused to help Jason up. "You’re hurt bad. Ambulance is here."

Alexander’s gaze never left Isabella.

Then Elvis appeared, pulling her into his arms. "I’ve got you. Let’s get you to the hospital."

Paramedics whisked Evelyn away.

"Elvis..." Isabella’s voice was hollow. "Will she wake up?"

Elvis held her tighter. "She’ll be fine."

His eyes met Alexander’s over her head—a silent nod of gratitude.

Alexander watched them leave, his heart in shreds.

Aaron approached, expression grim. "Mr. Kingsley. We need your statement."

Gordon bristled. "You think he did this? He saved her!"

"Enough," Alexander said quietly. "I’ll cooperate."

Aaron hesitated, then lowered his voice. "You can see her first. She’s... not stable right now."

The hospital was suffocating.

Jason was already in surgery—his shoulder injury severe enough to risk permanent damage.

Isabella had tried to force her way into the OR, but Cassius and Elvis held her back.

"Evie, the best surgeons are on it," Cassius murmured, stroking her hair. "We’ll save his arm."

"It’s my fault," she choked out.

"Don’t say that." Elvis’s voice cracked.

Footsteps echoed.

"Evadne!"

Arnold and Bet rushed in.

"Bet." Elvis’s eyes lit up.

Bet gave a curt nod before turning to Isabella.

She looked up at him, broken. "I messed up, Bet."

His throat tightened. He took her icy hands in his. "Even if the sky falls, I’ll be here."
###Chapter 392

"Bet, the mess I've made this time... the debts I owe... I'll never be able to repay them in this lifetime."

Evadne's voice broke as she buried her face in Cassius' chest, her shoulders shaking with silent sobs.

Her brothers had seen her cry before—countless times, ever since they were children.

To the world, she was the fierce, untouchable queen of the Ashbourne family. But to them, she was just their little sister—fragile, human, and in desperate need of comfort.

But this... this was different.

The weight of this grief was crushing her. It wasn't something she could shake off easily.

On the way to the hospital, Arnold and Bet had learned the full extent of the tragedy.

Jason was severely injured, but at least he was alive.

Erica, however... when they wheeled her into the ICU, she was barely clinging to life.

Evadne had nearly collapsed, begging the doctors to save her.

Now, they could only wait and pray.

"Big bro," Arnold said quietly, "Jason's hurt pretty bad. Have you told the Dempseys yet?"

Cassius' expression darkened. "Jason made me promise not to tell them before they took him into surgery. His mother's health is fragile—if she finds out, it might push her over the edge."

"But he's going to need months to recover," Arnold pointed out. "We can't keep this from them forever."

"Then we'll tell them after the surgery," Elvis cut in firmly. "Once he's stable. It'll be easier for them to handle."

Just then, Aaron rushed down the hallway, his face pale.

"Brothers! You're all here?"

The Ashbourne brothers stood together—each a force in his own right, united in their determination to protect Evadne.

But some wounds couldn't be shielded.

How could they possibly comfort her after this?

A girl had taken a bullet meant for her.

Erica had fallen right in front of her eyes.

No one with a conscience could walk away from that unscathed.

"Aaron, weren't you supposed to be at the police station?"

Elvis' question trailed off as his gaze landed on the figure standing a few paces behind Aaron.

Thaddeus.

Silent. Unmoving. Watching.

Gordon hovered behind him, tense.

Even if Thaddeus and Evadne had reconciled, the road ahead wouldn't be easy.

The Ashbourne brothers exchanged glances, their expressions unreadable.

Evadne wiped her eyes and walked toward Thaddeus, her steps heavy.

His pulse hammered as she approached.

"Are you hurt?" His voice was rough with worry.

She didn't answer. Instead, she met his gaze and whispered, "Erica's still in surgery."

"She'll make it," he said softly. "I'll wait with you. We'll get through this together."

His fingers twitched, aching to pull her into his arms.

"Why did you come tonight?" Her lashes were damp, her voice hollow.

"Erica came to see me this afternoon. She told me about your meeting." He didn't lie. "I was worried, so I followed."

And his fears had been justified.

Evadne's entire body tensed as she remembered Erica's last words—the secret she'd whispered before the gunshot.

Should she tell Thaddeus?

Her hand drifted to her jacket pocket, where Erica's shattered phone lay hidden.

Thaddeus frowned, shrugging off his suit jacket and draping it over her shoulders.

She didn't resist. Her mind was elsewhere—consumed by guilt, by grief, by the need for answers.

"Did they catch him?" she asked numbly.

"Not yet. But he won't get far." Thaddeus' voice was steel. "Every exit out of Elmsworth is locked down. Airports, highways, trains—he'd need wings to escape. And even then, I'd shoot him out of the sky."

His jaw clenched. "Attempted murder, illegal firearms—he'll pay with his life."

Erica's bloodstained face flashed in Evadne's mind again.

She pressed her hands over her ears, squeezing her eyes shut.

Thaddeus recognized the stress response instantly. His chest ached as he pulled her close, murmuring soft reassurances.

The Ashbourne brothers watched, their expressions a mix of frustration and reluctant gratitude.

Bet took a step forward, but Cassius and Elvis stopped him.

"I know you hate him," Elvis muttered. "So do I. But if he hadn't been there tonight..."

He didn't finish the sentence.

Bet's face paled.

Elvis shoved his hands in his pockets. "They were together for three years. If anything, he's the one who got the short end of the stick back then. He doesn't owe us anything—but he still came through for her tonight."

Arnold and Aaron exchanged glances.

Even Cassius looked surprised.

Elvis had been the most furious when Thaddeus secretly married Evadne. He'd nearly stormed the Abernathy headquarters.

But when it came down to it, Elvis had his own code.

Suddenly, the ICU doors swung open.

Evadne lunged forward.

Thaddeus was right behind her.

"Doctor! How is she?" Her voice was raw with desperation.

The doctor's gloves were stained with Erica's blood.

Everyone held their breath.

"The bullet pierced vital organs. She lost too much blood." The doctor shook his head. "By the time she got here, it was already too late. I'm sorry—we did everything we could."

We did everything we could.

Evadne knew what that meant.

Her brothers bowed their heads. Bet removed his cap, his face grim.

They'd braced for the worst, but hearing it confirmed was like a knife to the heart.

Evadne couldn't accept it.

"No. No, she was strong—she wouldn't just—" She grabbed the doctor's arm, shaking him. "You have to try again!"

"Evadne, stop!" Thaddeus wrapped his arms around her, absorbing her pain. "Erica didn't suffer. But the living have to keep going. We'll get justice for her."

Erica wasn't family. She wasn't even a close friend.

But she'd died for Evadne.

The guilt was suffocating.

"It's my fault," Evadne choked out. "I killed her."

Tears streamed down her face as she dug her nails into her chest, wishing she could tear her own heart out.

Thaddeus watched her unravel, his throat tight with grief.

When Evadne woke again, she was in a hospital bed, an IV in her arm.

Arnold and Elvis were at her side.

"Elvis," she whispered.

"I'm here." He squeezed her hand.

"Before Erica died... she said there was evidence on her phone. But it's broken. Can you fix it?"

"Easy." Elvis forced a smile. "Even if it's in pieces, I'll recover the data."

Evadne nodded weakly before closing her eyes again.

Arnold leaned forward. "Evadne, what kind of evidence? Is this connected to the attack? To Erica's death?"

"Yes. But I need proof before I can explain."

Her fists clenched, nails biting into her palms.

The pain kept her sharp.

It fueled her rage.

She would have revenge.

For Jason.

For Erica.

For everyone Elspeth had hurt.

At the end of the hallway, Thaddeus stood by the window, staring into the darkness.

He'd called Jareth, who arrived as soon as he could.

Jareth had tucked Mari into bed, left Lily to watch over her, and sped to the hospital.

"Don't worry," Jareth said, lighting a cigarette before remembering where he was and stashing it away. "The cops and my guys have the city on lockdown. That bastard won't get far."

"Thanks." Thaddeus' voice was rough.

"Did you tell Mari about Erica?"

"Hell no." Jareth ran a hand through his hair. "She loved that girl. If she finds out..."

"Yeah. Keep it from her."

Thaddeus exhaled. "Gordon checked—Erica's parents are gone. Only her grandmother's left."

"Life's cruel," Jareth muttered.

"I'll have Gordon bring her to Elmsworth. Top-tier care, whatever she needs."

Jareth nodded. "Might help Evadne, knowing she's taken care of."

He studied Thaddeus. "You need to watch Evadne. Don't let her spiral. She needs someone right now."

"I know."

Thaddeus smirked faintly. "You've changed, Jareth."

"How?"

"You're almost human now."

Jareth scowled. "What the hell does that mean?"

"Before Mari, you were a ghost."

"Fuck off."
###Chapter 393

The news hit Elspeth and Glynnis like a freight train.

A shooting. Evadne injured. Jason hurt. And now, Ward—a wanted man.

Their hearts pounded with terror, their breaths coming in short, panicked gasps.

"Mom," Glynnis whispered, her voice trembling. "What do we do?"

A sharp crack echoed through the room.

Elspeth's palm connected with Glynnis' cheek, sending her stumbling back into a coffee table. The impact rattled the glass, and Glynnis barely caught herself before collapsing.

Pain flared across her face, her skin burning.

Elspeth, usually so composed, now stood shaking with fury, her delicate hands curled into fists.

Glynnis touched her swelling cheek, her vision blurred by tears. She glared at her mother through tangled strands of hair, resentment simmering in her gaze.

"You incompetent fool!" Elspeth hissed, her voice low but venomous. "I told you to deal with the maid, not Evadne!"

Glynnis staggered to her feet, her voice thick with tears. "I did this for you! You said it was the perfect opportunity—Evadne meeting Erica in secret, no bodyguards. Ward could’ve ended her easily!"

"And yet, he failed!" Elspeth snapped. "Now he’s on the most wanted list!"

She wanted to strangle her daughter.

Instead, she wrapped herself in a blanket, her body trembling.

She needed Victor’s injection. Without it, she couldn’t sleep. Couldn’t think.

"First Alex, now Ward," Elspeth muttered. "Two of my best men—gone because of you!"

"Alex was your mess!" Glynnis shot back. "You wanted to ruin Myra. Don’t pin that on me!"

At least Alex hadn’t betrayed her.

But Ward?

He was being hunted by the police—and Thaddeus.

Would he crack under pressure?

The sudden ring of her phone made them both jump.

Elspeth snatched it up, her fingers shaking.

A private number.

She answered, her voice barely above a whisper. "Hello?"

"Mrs. Abernathy."

Ward’s voice was rough, the connection unstable.

"Where are you?" she demanded.

"Safe. For now." He paused. "I need twenty million. And a boat. Arrange it within three days."

"Twenty million?!" Elspeth’s eyes widened. "Are you insane? You’re the one who screwed up!"

"After everything I’ve done for you?" His tone turned icy. "Securing your position as the Abernathy CEO’s wife wasn’t easy. Twenty million is a small price to pay."

She gritted her teeth.

"And let’s not forget," he added, "your secret account in Country R. Fifty million, at least. Embezzled from Abernathy projects."

Her blood ran cold.

If Thaddeus or Evadne found out—

Prison.

A lifetime behind bars.

"Fine," she spat. "You’ll have your money. But after this, you disappear. Forever."

"Three days is too long," Ward countered. "I need it by sundown tomorrow. Or things get messy."

The line went dead.

Elspeth hurled her phone across the room, shattering a vase.

Alva, passing by with Thaddeus’ freshly tailored suit, froze at the sound.

"Crazy witch," she muttered, rolling her eyes.

Her phone buzzed—Thaddeus calling.

"Mr. Abernathy," she answered, stepping into a corner. "Are you coming home tonight?"

"Are Elspeth and Glynnis there?" His voice was calm, but Alva knew better.

"Yes. And they’re tearing the place apart."

A pause. "Keep an eye on Elspeth. If she leaves, call me immediately."

"Understood."

"And Alva—don’t confront her. She’s dangerous."

The call ended just as Elspeth’s door swung open.

Dressed in black, she looked like a widow in mourning.

Alva ducked behind a curtain, watching as Elspeth slipped into a car and sped away.

She dialed Thaddeus.

"She just left. Dressed like she’s going to a funeral."

Two days later, Thaddeus still hadn’t left the hospital.

He stayed in the room next to Evadne’s, watching over her like a shadow.

Only when she was asleep, sedated, did he allow himself to stand at her door.

Through the glass, he traced the outline of her face with his fingertips, his heart aching.

He could live like this—loving her silently.

But what if she didn’t even want that?

The smoking room door opened.

Elvis stepped inside, his smirk sharp as a blade.

"Give me a cigarette," he said, holding out his hand.

Thaddeus arched a brow but obliged, lighting it for him.

No one made Mr. Abernathy play servant.

But for Evadne’s brother?

He’d do anything.

Elvis exhaled a slow stream of smoke. "You’ve got impressive self-control. Watching her from afar like some tragic hero."

Thaddeus stiffened.

"If it were me," Elvis continued, grinning, "I’d have stormed in, kissed her senseless, and—"

"Enough," Thaddeus growled.

Elvis laughed, but his expression sobered. "I need your help. When we find the bastard who hurt her, I’m killing him myself."

"No," Thaddeus said flatly. "I’ll handle it."

"You can’t."

"Why not?"

Elvis met his gaze, deadly serious. "Because if you want a future with my sister, you stay clean. I’m used to blood on my hands. You’re not."

Thaddeus clenched his jaw. "I’ve killed before."

"Not like this." Elvis crushed his cigarette. "Don’t make her choose between loving you and hating what you’ve become."

Silence.

Then, softly, Thaddeus said, "Thank you... brother."

Elvis choked on his smoke.

"Did you just—"

His phone rang, cutting him off.

"What?" he barked.

"Mr. Waverley, Avery’s here. Demanding to see Miss Ashbourne."

Elvis grinned. "Perfect."

He hung up and clapped Thaddeus on the shoulder. "Come on. Let’s go punch something."

Outside Evadne’s room, Avery stood rigid, his golden-rimmed glasses glinting coldly.

"Let me in," he ordered.

The bodyguards didn’t budge.

"Mr. Chambers, you’re not on the list."

Avery’s jaw tightened. "Do you know who I am to Chairman Emeric?"

A lazy voice drawled from behind him.

"Oh, do tell. Because last I checked, my father only had four sons."

Avery spun around—

And froze.

Thaddeus and Elvis stood side by side, their expressions equally dangerous.

"What’s he doing here?" Harvey muttered.

Elvis smirked. "From the way you’re talking, one might think you’re some long-lost love child."

Avery’s face darkened.

Thaddeus stepped forward, his voice icy.

"Leave. Now."
###Chapter 394

Only Isabella and Oliver Sinclair in the entire Sinclair family dared to speak with such reckless audacity.

The bodyguards couldn't suppress their laughter, amplifying Nathan's humiliation.

Sebastian Kingsley arched a brow discreetly. The usually composed Mr. Prescott was unraveling before their eyes.

And if he claimed he took no satisfaction in that, he'd be lying.

"I'm here to check on Isabella. Must Oliver be so hostile?" Nathan's tailored suit did little to mask his rising fury, his chest heaving. "Just say you're here for her. Why drag William into this?"

Oliver's disdain was palpable as he leveled Nathan with a cold stare. "He's not your father, and we're not children anymore. Spare us the theatrics."

Nathan's expression darkened, his brows knitting together.

But Nathan was no ordinary man. His years of hardship in Seattle had forged a resilience in him, an ability to adapt swiftly.

He exhaled, softening his tone. "Oliver, I meant no offense. I'm just concerned about her. I heard she was injured. I only want to see how she's doing."

"Our family kept this quiet. Impressive how quickly you caught wind of it, Mr. Prescott." Oliver's sharp eyes narrowed, laced with sarcasm. "But Isabella is still recovering. The doctor advised against stress. She can't see you. Leave."

Nathan refused to yield. "Oliver—"

"One more thing. Even if you brought William, it wouldn't change a thing. Don't waste your time."

Oliver flashed Sebastian a grin. "Seb, let's go."

Seb?

Sebastian stiffened at the unexpected familiarity.

A chill ran down his spine.

"What are you waiting for? Move!" Oliver clapped Sebastian's back.

"Right, brother-in-law," Sebastian drawled.

Oliver's brows shot up.

Once he adjusted to the dynamic, he found it... oddly satisfying.

Especially the way Sebastian said it.

Nathan's chest tightened, his face paling.

He had no idea what had transpired in the past few days—how Sebastian had managed to win Oliver over when he himself had failed.

Suddenly, Oliver paused. "Mr. Prescott, you should know—forcing things never ends well. Some things, some people, aren't yours no matter how hard you try. Besides, you already have a beautiful woman by your side. She must be your type, or you wouldn't keep her so close, right?"

Nathan's breath hitched, fists clenching, heart pounding.

His eyes burned as he watched Oliver and Sebastian disappear down the hall, the weight of their words crushing him.

"Mr. Prescott."

The oppressive aura of the Sinclair heir left Nathan's assistant sweating. "What did Mr. Kingsley mean by that? The 'beautiful woman'—was he referring to Ms. Archer?"

Who else could it be?

But Nathan's greater concern was that Oliver already knew about the woman in Elmsworth who bore an uncanny resemblance to Isabella—and that she was by his side.

"Did Oliver see me that night at the bar with Elsie?" Nathan's voice was low, dangerous.

"You said the bar was too public, so you stayed in the car. He couldn't have seen you."

Harvey replied quickly, "Mr. Prescott, maybe he's bluffing? Your car's plates trace back to Prescott Group. He could be provoking you."

"Let's go." Nathan gritted his teeth.

"Where to, Mr. Prescott?"

"The Velvet Haven."

Sebastian and Oliver stood outside Isabella's hospital room.

"Thanks for earlier." Sebastian's voice carried rare sincerity.

"Don't mention it. Consider it payback for the 'brother-in-law' bit." Oliver smirked. "Besides, I wasn't just helping you. Putting Nathan in his place is always satisfying—and using you was the perfect way to do it."

He chuckled at the memory of Nathan's stunned face.

"I don't mind." Sebastian's lips twitched.

"I can't stand that Prescott bastard. Always riding on others' coattails. Bringing up William was a low blow. He’s all polish, no substance. No wonder his family doesn’t respect him."

Oliver shot Sebastian a teasing look. "You should thank him, really. He makes you look good by comparison."

Sebastian blinked.

So... he owed Nathan gratitude now?

"Mr. Kingsley."

A weak voice interrupted them.

Both men turned, startled. "Jason?"

A few steps away, Jason limped toward them, one arm in a cast, the other gripping a crutch.

Sebastian reacted instantly, striding forward to support him.

"Thank you, Mr. Kingsley," Jason murmured.

"Don't mention it. I should be thanking you for protecting Isabella." Sebastian's tone was casual, but his voice held depth.

"No need. Protecting Miss Sinclair is my duty." Jason's gaze was steady.

He'd do it all over again. No regrets.

After this ordeal, Jason's hostility toward Sebastian had eased. After all, Sebastian had saved Isabella—again.

"Jason! Are you trying to lose that arm? Who told you to get up?!" Oliver snapped.

"Do you know how close you were to losing it? William flew in the country's top surgeon for a two-day bone graft to save it. If you don’t care about your arm, at least respect his effort."

"Mr. Kingsley—"

"If you don’t listen, I’m calling your parents to babysit you." Oliver wasn’t joking.

Jason paled. "Mr. Kingsley, I—I keep dreaming about that night. I need to see Miss Sinclair."

"She's fine. The wound on her arm is healing. She just needs time alone." Oliver sighed.

Sebastian thought of Isabella's injury, bitterness flooding his mouth.

They'd been divorced a year, yet she kept getting hurt. He’d failed to protect her.

Risking his life for her meant nothing if he couldn’t keep her safe.

"I heard about Erica." Jason's voice was thick with grief. "Any news on that monster?"

"Not yet. I’ve been watching Elspeth and Glynnis. Elspeth went out tonight—probably meeting Ward. My men should report back soon."

Sebastian's eyes darkened. "Rest assured, I want him dead more than anyone. I looked into him. He’s killed before—not just Erica. Elspeth’s been covering his tracks."

"Elspeth’s wasted talent playing stepmom to you." Oliver scoffed. "Your family’s a den of vipers."

Jason shook his head. "More like a spider’s web."

"I’ll have to thank Elspeth if I see her tomorrow." Oliver smirked.

Sebastian frowned. "Thank her?"

"For not killing Isabella during those three years of marriage." Oliver’s tongue was sharp.

Back in their military days, he’d been the quiet one. Clearly, that had been an act.

Just then, the door opened, startling them.

Isabella stood there, dressed in her usual black suit, no makeup, yet breathtaking.

"Isabella?!"

"Miss Sinclair!"

Sebastian’s ears burned, heart racing.

He nearly called her name but hesitated.

In the chaos, he’d had reason to hold her close. Now, what excuse did he have?

"Jason, are you okay?" Isabella’s gaze locked on his injured shoulder, voice thick.

"I’m fine, Miss Sinclair."

Jason tried to lift his arm but winced. "I’ll recover soon. Then I’ll be back at your side."

"Once you’re healed, you won’t be my secretary anymore."

"Miss Sinclair, are you firing me?" Jason’s lips trembled as he stumbled toward her. "I know I’m not the best at combat, but I’ll train—"

Isabella smiled faintly. "I’m taking over William’s position at K Group. I want you to lead the legal department. You’ll still be helping me and Dad. Isn’t that better?"

To anyone else, it would be a promotion.

But Jason looked like a abandoned puppy.

To him, she was pushing him away.

She didn’t realize what he truly wanted—to stay by her side, always.

But after this, he knew he couldn’t protect her.

The only one who could was Sebastian.

Jason’s eyes welled as he glanced at Sebastian, who was staring at Isabella like she was his entire world.

"Focus on healing first." Isabella composed herself, forcing a bright smile. "K Group doesn’t need dead weight."

Jason nodded heavily, knowing her mind was made up.

"Oliver, is Erica’s body still at the morgue?" Isabella’s voice was hoarse.

"Yes. We brought her grandmother to Elmsworth yesterday. She begged us for justice."

Oliver’s expression darkened.

"Give Erica a proper funeral. And support her family—financially, emotionally. Whatever they need."

"Understood."

Oliver studied her. "You’re leaving the hospital? William will skin me alive."

"Lying here won’t change anything. Did you fix the phone?"

Oliver blinked. "It’s repaired. But I didn’t do it."

"Who did?"

"Aaron. Erica’s phone was evidence—sent to forensics. He said it’d be ready today."

Isabella’s gaze darkened as she stepped toward Sebastian, locking eyes with him.

Sebastian’s pulse spiked, fingers curling into his palm.

"Sebastian, come with me to the police station."

Her stare was intense, piercing his soul. "We need to cooperate with the investigation. And there’s something important I have to tell you."
###Chapter 395

Avery stormed back into The Velvet Haven.

Elsie had already received word of his arrival and was waiting nervously in the suite.

The door burst open with a violent crash, rattling the crystal chandelier overhead.

At the sight of Avery’s furious entrance, Elsie shrank back, her delicate frame trembling. She couldn’t bring herself to meet his gaze, curling in on herself like a frightened animal.

Behind her, Harvey stood frozen, his face pale with terror. He had served under Mr. Chambers long enough to know—when Avery was angry, people died.

"Mr. Chambers," Elsie whispered, her voice trembling.

No matter how much she resembled Evadne, she could never replicate her poise.

"Mr. Chambers, please, maybe it’s not what you think—"

Before she could finish, Avery snatched the crystal ashtray from the coffee table, his eyes burning with rage, and hurled it at her.

Elsie screamed, throwing her arms over her head.

But the ashtray didn’t hit her. It whizzed past her ear, smashing into the wall behind her with a deafening crack.

The impact left a deep dent in the plaster.

"All of this is your fault," Avery snarled, cracking his knuckles. His crimson gaze bore into her like a predator eyeing prey. "I gave you this face. I told you how to use it. So why did you go behind my back?"

Tears streamed down Elsie’s cheeks, but she didn’t dare make a sound.

"Now Elvis might suspect our connection. If he digs deeper, if Evadne finds out there’s a woman who looks just like her in Elmsworth—do you think she won’t piece it together? Just like with Thaddeus and Edith?" Avery’s face, already pale, turned ghostly white with fury.

"Mr. Chambers, I’m sorry—"

Her apology was cut short as Avery’s hand closed around her throat, lifting her off the ground.

"Mr. Chambers, no!" Harvey choked out, horrified.

Avery ignored him, his grip tightening.

Elsie gasped, her face flushing red, then purple. Her arms hung limp at her sides, tears spilling from her wide, terrified eyes.

"Ave..."

The name slipped from her lips, weak and desperate.

At that moment, all Avery saw was Evadne’s smile.

His grip loosened.

Because of her, he spared the woman before him.

"I already lost once to Thaddeus," Avery hissed, his voice low and dangerous. "Don’t make me lose again."

He released her abruptly, letting her crumple to the floor.

Elsie coughed violently, her vision swimming. For a moment, she thought she had died.

Avery pulled a silk handkerchief from his pocket, meticulously wiping his hands clean. Just like that, the monster vanished, replaced by the composed gentleman.

"Mr. Chambers," Elsie rasped, still struggling to breathe. "This mess is mine. Let me fix it for you."

Avery scoffed. "Fix it? How?"

"Kill Elvis for you."

Elvis.

The name sent a strange flutter through Elsie’s chest. That night at the bar, his teasing smirk had haunted her dreams.

Avery’s lips curled into a cruel smile. "He’s my woman’s brother. And you think you can just kill him?"

Elsie flinched, sweat soaking her hair. "I—I didn’t mean—"

"I don’t want him dead," Avery interrupted, his voice dripping with malice. "I want you to seduce him."

Elsie’s breath hitched. "What?"

"You two seemed... close that night." Avery’s gaze darkened with contempt. "If he’s already interested in you, use it. Make him yours. Then destroy him."

Elsie stared at him, tears still spilling.

Avery leaned in, gripping her chin. His thumb brushed roughly over her lips, smearing the vibrant red lipstick he had forced her to wear—Evadne’s signature shade.

"You’re beautiful," he murmured, his voice icy. "Elvis won’t resist you."

Elsie swallowed hard, forcing a smile—one that mirrored Evadne’s perfectly. "If that’s what you want, Mr. Chambers... I’ll do it."

Meanwhile, Evadne and Thaddeus arrived at the police station where Aaron was waiting.

"Aaron!" Evadne rushed forward, and her brother immediately pulled her into a protective embrace.

"You reckless brat," Aaron muttered, though his grip was gentle. "Do I need to handcuff you to keep you out of trouble?"

Evadne smirked, her eyes glinting mischievously. "Handcuff me? That’s a little kinky, don’t you think?"

Aaron’s face flushed crimson. "Evadne!"

Behind them, Thaddeus stiffened, his jaw tightening.

Jealousy was a stupid, irrational thing—especially when directed at her own brother.

Evadne quickly sobered. "Aaron, did they fix the phone?"

Aaron nodded, leading them inside. "Our tech team managed to recover the data."

He glanced at Thaddeus. "Mr. Abernathy, we’ll need your statement later."

"Of course," Thaddeus replied smoothly, though his gaze never left Evadne.

She could feel his eyes on her, intense and unreadable. She pressed her lips together, refusing to meet his stare.

Inside the interrogation room, Aaron placed Erica’s shattered phone on the table.

Evadne’s fingers trembled as she picked it up.

The screen flickered to life, displaying a photo of Erica and her grandmother, smiling brightly with a small dog in her arms.

A sharp pain lanced through Evadne’s skull.

She gasped, clutching her head, her vision blurring. The memories—the blood, the screams—flooded back.

"Evadne!" Aaron moved to comfort her, but Thaddeus was faster.

He pulled her into his arms, one hand cradling the back of her neck as he guided her forehead to rest against his shoulder.

"Breathe," he murmured, his voice steady. "Just breathe."

Evadne clung to him, her body shaking.

Aaron watched, conflicted.

He hated Thaddeus for what he’d done to his sister.

But right now, Thaddeus was the only one who could calm her.

When Evadne finally steadied, she jerked away, flustered.

"Thanks," she muttered, avoiding his gaze.

Thaddeus simply nodded.

She noticed the damp patch on his shoulder—her tears. Guilt twisted in her chest. She reached out, brushing at the fabric.

"I’ll have it dry-cleaned for you."

Thaddeus chuckled, his eyes softening. "Don’t bother. I like it just the way it is."

The air between them grew thick, charged with something unspoken.

Aaron cleared his throat loudly.

Evadne quickly pulled away, her cheeks burning.

Time to focus.

She turned back to the phone.

They had a killer to catch.
###Chapter 396

Isabella Sinclair gazed intently at Alexander Kingsley's striking features, his current smile radiating a warmth she'd never witnessed before.

She cleared her throat softly, quickly looking away as if meeting his sparkling eyes for another second would reveal some unspoken truth. The transformation in him was undeniable.

Once, Alexander had been as cold as the Arctic winter, an impenetrable fortress of ice.

Now he surrounded her like the first warmth of spring, offering an unexpected sense of security.

"Ahem, well."

Aaron Ashbourne, ever the bachelor, shattered the moment. "It's just a suit. Why bother washing it? Our family could buy Mr. Kingsley a hundred new ones. Isabella, just get him another. I'll cover it!"

"Generous as always, Captain Ashbourne." Alexander's lips curved slightly, his expression unreadable.

"Aaron, are you sure about that?"

Isabella arched an eyebrow, her mood lightening. "Unless I'm mistaken, Mr. Kingsley's suit is bespoke from a royal tailor. Even if available, your annual salary might only cover one sleeve."

Damn! That expensive?

Aaron's face fell instantly. "I take it back! Forget I said anything!"

Alexander's smile deepened as his gaze lingered on Isabella. "Only a genius designer like you would recognize such craftsmanship at a glance."

Isabella blinked in surprise. "When did you figure it out?"

"At Myra's birthday gala, when she wore that stunning evening gown. No—truthfully, I should have known the first time I saw you handling fabrics in Ms. Eunice's studio." His confession came with tender admiration.

Isabella bit her lower lip, eyes shimmering with unshed tears.

A storm of emotions churned within her—too complex, too raw to name.

Alexander suddenly remembered the tattered suit still preserved in his closet, the one Isabella had sewn for him stitch by stitch during their marriage. Each thread had been woven with love.

That devotion, that care—he might never receive it again.

He should have recognized then how extraordinary she was. But he'd been blind.

Seeing her sorrowful expression now shattered what remained of his already fractured heart.

The debt he owed her was immeasurable.

A lifetime might not be enough to repay it.

"Isabella, does Erica's phone hold crucial evidence? You seem desperate to recover it." Aaron's curiosity broke the silence.

Isabella nodded grimly. "Before she died, she whispered that her phone contained proof of Elspeth's crimes. Her final message to me."

A heavy silence fell over them.

Even in her last moments, the brave girl had thought not of herself, but of exposing evil to the light of justice.

"Then Elspeth must have killed her to keep that secret." Aaron's frown deepened.

"Exactly. The normally cautious Elspeth wouldn't have acted so recklessly otherwise. She needed Erica silenced permanently." Isabella's fists clenched, fury blazing in her eyes.

"And she dared target you!" Aaron slammed the table. "With five brothers and our father behind you? Without Dad's intervention, any one of us could make her regret being born!"

Alexander's calm eyes darkened like a lake under storm clouds.

What could drive Elspeth to such extremes?

Isabella's lips pressed into a bloodless line. "The hit on Erica was Elspeth's doing. But the attempt on my life? That reeks of Glynnis acting alone. Elspeth's too calculated for such rashness."

Logical.

Alexander gave a barely perceptible nod.

"Damn, isn't Glynnis Elspeth's daughter? Perfect—mother and daughter can share a prison cell!" Aaron spat, wishing he could throttle them both.

Isabella inhaled sharply, her gaze locking with Alexander's.

"—Elspeth killed Cynthia. The evidence is in my phone."

Alexander froze under her intense stare, confusion flickering across his face.

Isabella unlocked Erica's phone, scrolling through galleries—nothing. Then the voice recordings.

There.

Her breath hitched as she pressed play.

The audio was muffled, recorded in some confined space.

But in the silent room, every word rang clear.

Elspeth and Glynnis's damning conversation unfolded.

"—Mom! You need to cut ties with Victor! He's dangerous! Cynthia's secret must die with everyone who knows it!"

Alexander's pupils contracted violently.

Cynthia?

"—Impossible! After twenty years? Unless that wretched woman rises from the grave, no one knows what really happened!"

Isabella's heart pounded, fury igniting in her chest.

Aaron looked equally stunned—this involved Frederic's late wife?

No wonder Elspeth was desperate.

"Isabella." Alexander's voice was barely audible.

Tears welled in his usually bright eyes, more devastating than shattered glass.

"—What about Acacia?!"

Even Acacia was involved?

Isabella shuddered, realization dawning.

Alexander's mother's death was no accident—it was murder.

When she'd been Mrs. Kingsley, she'd asked Alva about his mother. The maid had always hesitated, saying Alexander disliked discussing it.

She'd said he hadn't always been so cold—once, he'd been a joyful boy.

His mother's death had destroyed that boy.

Twenty years. The victim dead, the murderer living in luxury.

Where was the justice?

"—She's nothing! Just keep tabs on that maid I bribed—"

"—Yes, she's in R city, running a diner. She owes us; she'll stay silent."

"—Good. That bitch died consumed by guilt. Her son will never know the truth. Whenever I think of that bastard being fooled, it eases all my suffering!"

CRASH!

Alexander stood abruptly, chair toppling, his entire body radiating lethal fury. "I'll kill her."

Isabella recoiled at the raw hatred in his bloodshot eyes.

She'd never seen him like this—a man pushed beyond breaking.

His lips trembled; the pain of this revelation was worse than being flayed alive.

"I'll kill Elspeth. Everyone involved in my mother's death—I'll send them all to hell!"

He lunged for the door.

"Alexander! Stop!"

Isabella threw her arms around him from behind, clinging desperately.

"Aaron's right!" She pressed against his back, feeling his ragged breaths. "Murder isn't the answer! Stay rational! Elspeth deserves to die, but not by your hand! What would happen to me if you—?"

Her words, especially the last, struck like a tranquilizer.

Gradually, his breathing steadied.

But she didn't loosen her grip.

She understood his pain too well.

After an eternity, Alexander's cold hand covered hers. "Isabella... I'm sorry. I scared you."

Her heart ached. Even now, he apologized?

"You've done nothing wrong," she whispered.

"But what do I do?" Tears streamed down his face. "The murderer lived under my roof for twenty years, and I never knew. Tell me—how else can I avenge my mother?"

"Hold on. It's almost over." Her hand soothed his trembling back. "I want Elspeth and Glynnis to suffer too. I'm with you, Alexander. Whatever dangers come, we'll face them together. We'll watch them burn."

Alexander closed his eyes, gripping her hand like a lifeline.

This wasn't a vow before God, but it was truer than any oath.

They stood united—not for love, but for vengeance.

Yet Alexander found solace in that.

Mother, if you're watching... bless me now.
###Chapter 397

The night had been a relentless storm of shock and chaos.

Even for a hardened detective like Aaron, it was overwhelming. He'd planned to send Thaddeus home to rest, but the man refused, stubbornly insisting on aiding the investigation despite his shattered state.

His situation was dire.

Windermere Estate, the place now tainted by unbearable grief and fury, was no longer an option.

Returning to his grandfather’s home? Impossible. He feared losing control, burdening the old man with worry.

So there he stood, dazed at the police station entrance, a bitter smile twisting his lips.

Thaddeus Abernathy—billionaire CEO, a man with everything—now looked like a lost soul, homeless and broken.

Pathetic. Laughable. Tragic.

"You can stay at my place tonight."

Evadne’s soft offer made him freeze. He stared at her, wondering if grief had finally driven him mad.

Even in his wildest dreams, he wouldn’t have dared imagine this.

"I can manage a hotel."

"Don’t overthink it." Her lashes fluttered slightly. "You can’t go back to Windermere, and you won’t go to your grandfather’s. I won’t rest knowing you’re alone in some hotel, possibly doing something reckless."

Her voice hardened. "If something happens to you, revenge becomes harder. The fight drags on. I don’t like fighting alone."

His breath hitched.

Fighting alone.

He knew that feeling—giving everything, receiving nothing.

When she was young, she’d chased him relentlessly, and he’d ignored her.

Three years ago, she married him, and he’d never once returned her love.

He turned away, struggling to compose himself. He’d already broken down once in that interrogation room. He wouldn’t show weakness in front of her again.

"Whether you agree or not, I’m keeping an eye on you tonight. Hotel? I’ll stay with you. Bridge? I’ll sleep there too."

Her stubbornness was a force he couldn’t fight.

His pale cheeks flushed. His pulse raced.

He wasn’t arrogant enough to assume her motives, but her words still sparked something warm in his chest.

"Then... I’ll trouble you for tonight." His voice was rough.

"Enough. You’ve crossed every line with me. No need for formalities."

Her heart skipped. Afraid he’d hear it, she strode ahead.

Thaddeus swallowed, a faint smile tugging at his lips as he followed.

Evadne’s villa was cold, empty since Jason’s injury.

Thaddeus stepped inside, his usual indifference replaced by curiosity. He studied every corner, every trace of her presence.

This was her home.

A place he’d only ever stood outside of, drenched in rain, feeling small.

Now, he was inside.

A childish urge struck him—to snap a photo and send it to Jareth with a taunt: Who said only you could come here?

"Thaddeus."

Evadne’s voice snapped him back. She arched a brow. "You look like you’re plotting something."

"Sorry." He averted his gaze, embarrassed.

"Pick any room except the last one on the left upstairs. Jason left food in the fridge if you’re hungry. No chef here."

She turned toward the stairs.

"Why can’t I go in that room?"

"Because it’s my bedroom."

She paused, glancing back with an unreadable smile. "No dark secrets or ex-lovers hidden there. Feel free to look if you want."

Her tone was teasing, but the words carried an edge.

She still remembered the photos of that woman in his study.

She wasn’t a saint. She was allowed to hurt.

"Evadne." His eyes glistened.

He knew she was still wounded.

But hope flickered in his chest. If she truly didn’t care, why bring it up?

Her mentioning it meant she did care.

About his past. About him.

"Do what you want. I’m going up." Her voice darkened. "Pull yourself together. The fight’s about to start."

"I sold the villa." His chest tightened. "Everything inside is gone—except my mother’s photos."

Her gaze was icy. "That’s your business. Not mine."

"I know their existence hurt you."

"And you kept them because you couldn’t let go." She laughed softly, as if it no longer mattered.

"I forgot about it. I’d asked Gordon to sell it long ago, but he never got around to it."

His throat burned, but he forced the words out. "That night—I was drugged. I don’t remember anything. Jareth couldn’t send me to a hotel or Windermere. He took me there without thinking."

"Thaddeus." She held up a hand. "Enough. I’m tired."

"How can it not matter? Don’t you resent me for it?"

Sweat beaded on his forehead. His breathing turned ragged.

"There’s more than just that to resent you for."

The words pierced his heart. His fists clenched.

"But now? It’s all in the past."

She turned slowly, her tone casual—though she didn’t notice the tears welling in her eyes.

"Let’s look ahead. Even the deepest emotional wounds mean nothing compared to hatred, right? They just slow us down."

She started up the stairs.

Then—

A weight crashed into her back.

Thaddeus wrapped his arms around her, crushing her against him as if trying to fuse their bodies together.

His feverish chest pressed against her slender frame. His heartbeat pounded through her, dizzying, weakening her knees.

"Thaddeus." Her voice was hoarse.

She didn’t struggle.

"How can it mean nothing?" His grip tightened. "Twenty years ago, I lost the most important person in my life. Twenty years later, I found my only one."

His breath scorched her neck. "I won’t lose you again. Without you, every day is purgatory."

Death didn’t scare him. He’d die for her a thousand times.

But losing her? That terrified him.

His chin rested on her hair, his voice breaking.

This proud, untouchable man—now reduced to begging like a wounded animal.

Evadne’s heart ached.

She’d seen him fearless in battle. Ruthless. Unbreakable.

Now? He was shattered.

And she pitied him.

So tonight, she’d let it go.

"Ah—it hurts." She winced.

"Hurt? Where?" Panic spiked his voice.

"Here! Right here!"

At the police station, she’d used her body to calm him—reopening the wound on her arm. She’d ignored it, used to pain.

But this idiot hadn’t noticed. He’d held her too tight, squeezing until—

"Damn it!"

Thaddeus released her, horrified.

Blood stained his sleeve—her blood.

Her dark suit had hidden it.

"Silly girl! Why didn’t you say something?"

"Why are you yelling at me?" She bit her lip, glaring.

He froze.

Yell? He dared?

In front of her, he was nothing. A servant.

"It’s fine. Just a scratch—ah!"

Her vision blurred as he scooped her up, her body instinctively pressing against his chest.

"I’m taking you to your room. Where’s the first aid kit? I’ll bandage it."

"I don’t need help! I’m a surgeon!"

Her small fist thumped his chest—weak, like a kitten’s paw.

"And my arm hurts, not my legs! Why are you carrying me?"

"Because I want to."

The raw honesty stunned her.

Her cheeks burned.

Her bedroom was surprisingly simple—minimalist, despite her wealth.

He remembered her vibrant tastes at the Abernathy mansion. The weekly sheet changes. Fresh flowers.

Now? Bare. Functional.

"You’re so young. Why is your room like this?" He set her down gently. "If you want, I can bring Grandpa’s antiques. Alvae can help redecorate."

"No need. I like it plain."

"Sorry."

"Ugh. Are you a parrot? Say something else."

"I’m sorry."

She groaned. "Just stop talking."

His heart ached.

He found the first aid kit, helped her out of her jacket. When he saw her sweat-drenched shirt, his chest tightened.

"Don’t hold back anymore." His voice shook.

"Never again." Her eyes blazed. "My mercy got innocent people hurt."

Lost in her fury, she didn’t notice his fingers working at her buttons—one by one—until the last one slipped free.

Her lace bra peeked through, her skin like fresh snow.

Thaddeus’ gaze locked on the delicate bow between her breasts. Heat surged. His throat dried.

He was a gentleman.

But with her? Impure thoughts were inevitable.

"Ah!"

A sharp slap echoed through the room.

Her face burned crimson. She’d hit him.
###Chapter 398

The slap wasn't as harsh as before. This time, Alexander could almost mistake it for a caress, making the corners of his lips twitch into a rare, playful smirk.

"Did that bastard just smirk?" Isabella muttered to herself, a flush of irritation heating her cheeks. "He's getting bolder by the second."

She crossed her arms defensively, her face burning. "What do you think you're doing, stripping me?"

Alexander gazed at her with tender eyes. "I'm treating your wounds."

What a righteous excuse.

"You could've waited outside for me to change! Or used scissors to cut the sleeve! Was stripping me really necessary?"

Her eyes blazed with fury as she glared at him. "You're shameless, acting like some reckless playboy!"

"Isabella," he murmured, his voice low and rough, "we were married. We've been intimate before—during our marriage, and even after our divorce."

She bit her lip, her breath hitching at the memory of those heated nights.

His voice was thick with restraint, his gaze dark with hunger. "I've seen every inch of you, even the parts no one else has. Wouldn't it be hypocritical to pretend otherwise?"

He didn’t wait for her answer. Instead, he closed the distance between them, making her flinch as he peeled away her clothes, exposing her flushed skin to his ravenous stare.

"Isabella, relax. Let me take care of you." His voice was soft, coaxing, so tender it made her pulse race.

His hands trembled as he dressed her wounds, his eyes drinking in the sight of her.

"Thank you," she started, but he cut her off, pinning her beneath him.

"You can thank me another way."

Before she could protest, his lips crashed against hers in a desperate kiss, like a man starved finally finding water.

The air between them grew thick with desire. His mouth moved over hers with unrestrained hunger, yet every touch was laced with aching tenderness. The sensations overwhelmed her, drowning her in pleasure.

She couldn’t feel pain—only bliss, addictive and consuming.

Was this love?

She hated him, yet here she was, lost in ecstasy because of him.

The next morning, Isabella woke sore and exhausted.

Thirsty, she dragged herself downstairs. The sizzle of a pan and the rich aroma of breakfast greeted her.

She paused in the kitchen doorway, stunned.

Alexander stood at the stove, an apron straining over his sculpted torso. The sight of him—so out of place in a domestic setting—was both absurd and endearing.

His broad shoulders tapered to a narrow waist, his rolled-up sleeves revealing corded forearms. Every movement flexed his muscles, a living testament to raw masculinity.

Isabella’s lips curled mischievously. Barefoot, she crept up behind him unnoticed.

A puff of smoke rose from the pan. He wiped sweat from his brow, sighing in frustration.

"Burnt again."

Only then did she notice the pile of charred eggs in the trash.

"You idiot," she teased. "The heat’s too high, and the oil’s scorching. At this rate, you’ll single-handedly decimate the poultry industry."

He startled, spinning to face her. His eyes—usually so composed—were wide with guilt.

"Did I wake you?"

"No," she said dryly. "My internal clock did. Unlike some people, I don’t laze in bed."

She gestured to the trash. "If Daniel sees this, he’ll make you eat every last scrap. He despises waste."

Alexander shrugged. "I wouldn’t mind. The military drilled that into me."

She waved a hand hastily. "Relax, Mr. Kingsley. It was a joke. No need for extreme measures."

He exhaled, running a hand through his hair. "I underestimated cooking. Watching Margaret do it made it seem easy. Turns out, it’s a skill I’m far from mastering."

His admission softened her.

"I wanted to surprise you with breakfast," he admitted, frowning at the mess. "But it seems we’ll have to order from The Chateau Royale instead."

She saw right through him. He was willing to step so far out of his comfort zone—just for her.

This man, who had never set foot in a kitchen during their marriage. Margaret once confided that he’d hated the smell of oil since childhood, a remnant of the slums where he grew up, surrounded by greasy diners.

Touched, she nudged him aside. "Alright, enough destruction. I’ll handle it."

Suddenly, she coughed violently—the smoke triggering her allergy.

"Isabella!" He caught her shoulders, alarmed. "Are you sick?"

"No," she rasped. "Just smoke allergies. Open a window."

Smoke allergies?

Alexander froze.

Had she always had this? Had she suffered through it every time she cooked for him and his family?

Before she could reach for the spatula, he pulled her into his arms.

"Hey," she protested. "How am I supposed to cook like this?"

"Don’t." His voice was rough, his grip tight. "Never cook again."

He buried his face in her neck, his breath shaky. "I’ll learn. I’ll cook for you."

She scoffed. "Give it up. You’re hopeless."

Then she flushed, realizing how domestic that sounded—as if they were bound together forever.
###Chapter 399

Thaddeus didn't press further. His mind was consumed by her smoke allergy—guilt and frustration twisting inside him.

"I'll have Gordon deliver dinner. Or maybe he can cook it himself. His skills aren't as refined as Mr. Jason's, but they'll do."

His gaze dropped to Evadne's bare feet, pale and delicate against the cold tiles. With a frown, he effortlessly lifted her by the waist.

"What are you doing?" Evadne gasped, her fingers gripping his broad shoulders.

"You can't walk around barefoot. The floor is freezing."

He set her gently on the table, kneeling before her. His warm hands enveloped her feet, the heat familiar and comforting.

Evadne closed her eyes, savoring the sensation but careful not to show it.

"Alva once told me a woman's feet must never get cold. It leads to illness later in life." Thaddeus looked up, his expression stern. "Don't do this again."

"I was in a hurry!" she protested, cheeks flushing.

Thaddeus smirked. "In a hurry? Afraid I'd leave?"

Her toes curled in his palm.

"You were unconscious. Did you really think I'd walk away?"

As if he could.

He wanted to stay by her side every night, to claim a permanent place in her heart.

His hands slid up her legs as he stood, pulling her close. His lips brushed her forehead—a fleeting touch that only made him crave more.

Evadne's skin burned under his gaze, her face warm with embarrassment.

Even after everything they'd shared, his proximity still flustered her.

Just as his lips hovered over hers, the doorbell rang.

Again. And again.

Relentless.

Annoyed, Evadne pushed him away. "Who is it? Only my brothers have the passcode."

"Gordon." Thaddeus sighed, already regretting summoning his oblivious secretary. "I told him to come if there was news."

"What news?"

"About Elspeth and the murderer."

Her eyes lit up, and she scrambled to jump down—only for Thaddeus to scoop her into his arms.

"No shoes, remember?"

Evadne gaped at him. Only Emeric had carried her like this when she was a child, and she'd been much lighter then.

Hormones raged.

Ignoring her protests, Thaddeus opened the door.

"Mr. Thaddeus?"

Gordon froze, taking in the scene—Thaddeus holding Evadne like a bride, both disheveled as if freshly woken.

His mind short-circuited.

Were they finally back together? Could he finally retire in peace?

"Put me down!" Evadne hissed, mortified.

Thaddeus ignored her, addressing Gordon. "May I let him in?"

She glared but nodded.

"Ah, can I come in too?"

A familiar, irritating voice chimed in.

Jareth stood behind Gordon, grinning like a fox.

"Congratulations."

"For what?" Thaddeus scowled.

"For finally being allowed inside." Jareth winked at Evadne.

She rolled her eyes.

"Say what you came to say or leave," Thaddeus snapped.

"I do have news. Mind letting me in, lovebirds?"

Thaddeus: "Come in."

Evadne: "We are not lovebirds."

Jareth strolled past them, smug.

Thaddeus set Evadne down and knelt to slide her shoes on. She quickly put distance between them, but the damage was done.

In the living room, Thaddeus sat so close their thighs touched. When his arm snaked around her waist, she dodged—earning a chuckle.

So shy now, after last night.

He played with a strand of her hair, savoring her irritation.

Gordon cleared his throat. "Elspeth didn't meet Ward. Too risky with all the scrutiny."

"Then what?" Evadne leaned forward.

"She went to Elmsworth Bank. To transfer funds."

"How much?"

"Twenty million."

Jareth whistled. "Saving up for her funeral, huh?"

"Hush money for Ward," Thaddeus muttered.

"But here's the thing—she pulled it from a secret account in Country R. No way Frederic knows about it."

Evadne tapped her chin. "She has Abernathy Group shares. Dividends alone would cover that."

Thaddeus shook his head. "Frederic monitors her finances. That money's dirty. I suspect Moonlit Treasures was a front for bribes, but twenty million? That's beyond their reach."

"Why not expose it earlier?" Evadne challenged.

"Wouldn't have been enough to destroy her. And Frederic would've shielded her, damaging the company." His voice darkened. "Back then, I didn't know she killed my mother. I was... weak."

Jareth and Gordon exchanged shocked glances.

Evadne's chest ached. "You were young. Revenge takes time."

His gaze locked onto hers, gratitude and longing mingling.

If not for their audience, he'd have kissed her senseless.

"But you're right—current evidence isn't enough. Frederic will protect her."

Gordon slammed his fist on the table. "She needs to rot in prison!"

"Not just prison," Evadne and Thaddeus said in unison. "She dies."

Jareth smirked. "Question is—how do we make Frederic abandon her?"

Gordon shrugged. "Prove she cheated. Men like him can't stomach betrayal."

Evadne's lips curved. "Good thing she has cheated. Multiple times."

Three pairs of eyes widened.

"Besides Alex?" Thaddeus asked sharply.

"Remember Dr. Victor from the police recording?"

Thaddeus caught on instantly. "Your inside man?"

"Smart boy." Her praise made him blush. "He's a K Group scholar. Joined our revenge team willingly."

Thaddeus's jaw tightened. "A male scholar?"

Jareth cackled. "Oh, you're jealous! Is he younger? More energetic?"

Thaddeus shot him a murderous look.

Evadne grinned. "Maybe."

Thaddeus looked ready to combust.

Gordon steered the conversation back. "So you had Dr. Victor seduce Elspeth?"

"More than that." Evadne's smile turned icy. "She's addicted now. To a banned surgical anesthetic. Overdoses cause delirium... and incontinence."

The room fell silent.

Her fists clenched. Payback's a bitch, Elspeth.
###Chapter 400

The twenty million dollars belonging to Elspeth was securely deposited in the Bank of Country R. This was undeniable proof that the funds in her Country R account were the fruits of her embezzlement.

To be able to withdraw twenty million at a moment's notice meant she must have siphoned off staggering sums—likely from the Abernathy Group's various revenue streams and the bribes she collected as the chairman's wife.

"Gordon, has Elspeth transferred the money to Ward yet?" Thaddeus asked, his gaze as deep and unfathomable as the night sky.

"It's done. The transfer is complete."

"Has he withdrawn it?"

"Not yet. That kind of cash requires a damn armored truck! Carrying that much money is way too conspicuous, especially when he's trying to flee."

Thaddeus gave a slight nod. "Good. Contact the authorities immediately and freeze Ward's account."

"Right away, Mr. Thaddeus!" Gordon stood and strode out to make the call.

Freezing an account was child's play for law enforcement.

"That bastard won't get a single cent now," Evadne murmured, her sharp eyes gleaming with satisfaction. "And when he realizes he's been cut off, he'll turn on Elspeth in desperation."

"Our priority now is tracking Ward down," Evadne continued. "Once we have him, he'll have no choice but to expose Elspeth's crimes."

"Actually, we already have a lead on him." Jareth lounged back in his chair, one leg casually draped over the armrest.

Evadne and Thaddeus turned to him in unison. "What?"

"You think I came here just to chat? If I wanted a social visit, I'd have brought Mari along."

Jareth's arm rested lazily over the back of the couch, exuding the effortless dominance of a mafia prince. "One of our Fairhaven operatives picked up a trail at Sunset Harbor. Two fishermen spotted Ward sneaking onto a cargo ship under cover of darkness. The ship is bound for Country T. Looks like he's trying to slip out of the country."

"Country T?" Evadne frowned. "Do you think he might change course mid-journey?"

"Possible, but the neighboring countries along the route are backwaters. What's he going to do with twenty million there—burn it for warmth?"

Jareth smirked. "I've got men tailing him discreetly. We're monitoring all possible ports of call. But we have to be careful not to spook him. If he jumps ship or switches to a speedboat, things get messy."

He leaned forward, his expression turning serious. "Evadne, Thad, don't worry. Even if he makes it out of the country, the Fairhaven Group will drag him back—in one piece."

Smuggling was the Fairhaven Group's specialty, after all.

"My brother has connections in Country T," Evadne said eagerly. "I'll reach out to him. With his help, we can corner Ward before he slips away."

Jareth grinned. "Perfect. The more allies, the better."

Thaddeus shot Jareth a sharp look.

Since when had this guy become so insufferably smug?

With both Thaddeus and Jareth delivering good news, Evadne couldn't suppress her relief.

Ever the gracious hostess, she excused herself to prepare drinks at the bar.

The moment she was out of earshot, Jareth slid closer to Thaddeus.

"Aren't you cold?" Thaddeus asked dryly.

"Huh? No. Why?"

"Then move. Your cologne is giving me a headache."

Jareth scoffed. "Too bad. Mari loves it."

His gaze flickered over Thaddeus, lingering on a faint red mark peeking out from beneath his collar. Jareth's smirk widened. "So. You and Evadne finally did the deed last night, huh?"

Thaddeus's lashes lowered slightly, his dark eyes glinting. "What makes you say that?"

Despite his best efforts to remain composed, the faint upward curve of his lips betrayed him.

"Christ, you look like the cat that got the cream. One glance at you and I want to gag."

"Is there a problem?" Thaddeus met his gaze evenly. "Am I not allowed to be intimate with the woman I'm going to marry?"

"We're all adults here. No judgment if it's consensual." Jareth leaned in, lowering his voice. "But tell me you at least used protection."

Thaddeus blinked. "What?"

"Condoms, Thad. Did you use one? What about last time?"

Jareth had no qualms asking. They were men, after all, and Thaddeus—despite his ruthless reputation—was painfully inexperienced when it came to love. Evadne was his first and only.

"Last time," Thaddeus admitted, "I wasn't in any state to think about that."

"And this time?"

"I pulled out."

Jareth groaned, slinging an arm around Thaddeus's shoulders. "Buddy, if your swimmers are particularly determined, pulling out won't cut it. She could still end up pregnant."

He sighed. "Next time, wrap it up. You two just got back on track. Don't rush things."

His tone turned serious. "Evadne is Emeric's daughter. If you care about her, don't let her get pregnant before marriage. Society won't be kind to her—especially with her history."

"Jareth."

Thaddeus met his gaze, his voice low and intense. "If Evadne were pregnant with my child, do you honestly think I'd abandon her?"

His fingers curled into fists. "She's the only woman I want for the rest of my life. Married or not, she's mine. If she's pregnant, I'll propose to the Ashbournes immediately. I'll give her the grand wedding she deserves—everything I failed to give her before."

Jareth arched a brow. "You're getting ahead of yourself. You don't even know if Evadne would say yes."

He chuckled, shifting gears. "Mari and I plan to have five kids once we're married. How about you two? With your combined fortunes, you could buy a small country. Might as well populate it."

"If Evadne wants children, I won't object." Thaddeus's gaze softened, his mind drifting to a future filled with laughter and tiny footsteps.

"You like kids?" Jareth grinned. "I love 'em. Can't wait to take mine to amusement parks."

Thaddeus closed his eyes briefly, picturing Evadne's shy smile, her hands cradling a rounded belly. His pulse quickened.

"Yes. I like children."

But only if they were hers.

Unbeknownst to them, Evadne stood frozen on the other side of the wall, her hands trembling around the tray.

Their conversation burned into her memory.

"I like children too, Thaddeus," she whispered, her vision blurring. "I used to dream of having yours."

Her breath hitched. "But if you're pinning your hopes on me... I'm afraid that dream is impossible."

Tears welled in her eyes as she slid down the wall, her legs giving way.

Whether she could bear children no longer mattered.

After losing one, she would never have another.

News of Thaddeus and Evadne's night together reached Cassius swiftly.

Furious, the eldest Ashbourne brother prepared to storm over and give Thaddeus a beating for daring to touch his sister.

Elvis intercepted him.

"What's the point? It's done. They're adults—you couldn't have stopped it."

Cassius glared. "Are you condoning this?"

"At the very least, I don't support Evadne being with Avery."

Cassius shook his head. "Neither of them are good enough for her."

"But Thaddeus loves her. He made mistakes, but he's trying to make amends. Avery, on the other hand, has ulterior motives." Elvis crossed his arms. "And Emeric's sudden change of heart? You really think Avery didn't manipulate him?"

Cassius frowned, considering.

His usually detached younger brother had a point.

"I've had my suspicions," Cassius admitted. "The night Father and the others returned, Avery was at the hospital. He stayed behind while Father went upstairs—too convenient. That same night, Father announced he wanted to marry Evadne to Avery to ally with the Chambers Group."

His jaw tightened. "Arnold and I objected, but Father wouldn't budge."

Elvis's expression darkened. He crushed a glass in his hand, shards scattering.

"If Emeric dares force Evadne into this marriage," he growled, "I won't kill Avery—but I'll make sure he never fathers children."

Just then, the study door swung open.

Chasel sauntered in with a tray, startling both brothers.

"Mr. Bright," Cassius said coolly, "knocking is customary."

Chasel smirked. "My hands were full. Want me to go back and knock with my ass?"

Elvis lit a cigarette, eyeing Chasel with amusement.

The way Chasel talked to Cassius was oddly reminiscent of a lover's pout.

And damn, that ass was perky.

"What do you want?" Cassius asked.

"Aunt Suri made soup. Sent me to nourish you two." Chasel's tone dripped sarcasm.

Elvis stretched his legs out, cigarette bobbing. "I'd rather have a beer. And light this for me."

Chasel's face flushed. "You're pushing it."

"Elvis, behave." Cassius's deep voice cut through the tension. "Chasel is a guest. Show some respect."

Elvis sighed dramatically. "Fine, fine. I'm the villain." He stood, snagging a mug of soup. "Tastes like dishwater."

Chasel looked ready to flip the table.

What kind of genetic anomaly produced these Ashbourne brothers?

Elvis yawned and left, leaving Cassius and Chasel alone.

The air thickened with unspoken tension.

Cassius ignored Chasel, treating him like furniture.

The cold dismissal stung. Chasel, a seasoned flirt, found himself uncharacteristically flustered.

Was Cassius playing hard to get—or had that night meant nothing?

Cassius, his vision strained from overwork, reached for his glasses. The silver frames lent him a scholarly air, like a nobleman returned from abroad.

Chasel's breath caught.

Before he could stop himself, he swiveled Cassius's chair, caging him against the desk.

"Mr. Chasel," Cassius said calmly, looking up. "What are you doing?"

"Cassius," Chasel murmured, his fox-like eyes gleaming. "Has anyone ever told you how damn sexy you look in glasses?"

He braced a knee on Cassius's thigh, rubbing slowly.

Cassius's breath hitched.

His gaze dropped to Chasel's exposed collarbone, remembering how he'd torn that shirt open, his mouth tracing every inch.

Drunk or not, he'd been obsessed with that collarbone.

Because once, long ago, it had been his lover's favorite spot too.

"Cassius," Chasel whispered, arms looping around his neck. "Why do you ignore me when you're sober?"

His voice turned accusing. "You couldn't get enough of me that night. Now you act like I don't exist. Are all Ashbourne men this fickle?"

"Get off." Cassius's voice was soft but firm.

Memories of that night agitated him. His patience with Chasel was wearing thin.

Chasel, used to Cassius's gentleness, stiffened at his coldness. He clung tighter.

"You hypocrite. You took advantage of me. How can you treat me like this now?"

Cassius took a deep breath. "I'll count to three."

"One, two, three—so what?" Chasel challenged, eyes blazing.

Cassius shoved him away hard.

Chasel stumbled back, barely catching himself.

"Damn it!"
###Chapter 401

The impact sent Sebastian crashing against the bookshelf, sending a shower of leather-bound volumes tumbling down around him. One particularly heavy book struck his temple, leaving his ears ringing with a dull ache.

"Damn it, Alexander! What the hell was that?"

"I warned you, didn't I?"

A flicker of concern crossed Alexander's face as he took in Sebastian's pained expression, but it vanished just as quickly. "Sebastian, my sister needs your help, but that doesn't mean you can push me around. Whatever happened that night—it ends here. If you behave, we can still be family. If you keep this up, I can't promise I'll stay civil."

Patience had never been Alexander's strong suit.

Among the Ashbourne siblings, he was known for his explosive temper. A decade ago, anyone who dared lay a hand on him like this would've left with broken fingers.

"Alexander. So you're denying what happened that night?" Sebastian's voice shook, his fists clenched so tight his knuckles turned white.

"We kissed. We held each other. And then what? Did we go any further?"

Alexander slowly turned his chair, removing his glasses to reveal cold, detached eyes. "That's all there was to it. You know exactly how it happened, Sebastian. If you hadn't initiated it, nothing would've happened at all."

"But you could've stopped me like you did just now! You didn't!"

Sebastian glared at him, his eyes burning like a cornered fox's. "You do have feelings for me. Otherwise, with your personality, even if I stripped naked and threw myself at you, you would've shoved me away!"

"Sebastian, I've done my research. I know about your past. The number of men you've been with is... impressive."

Sebastian froze, suddenly feeling exposed under Alexander's piercing gaze.

"Let me ask you—when you slept with those men, did you actually love any of them?"

The question struck like a knife to the chest.

Love?

He'd never loved any of them.

Those fleeting encounters were just distractions, ways to fill the emptiness of lonely nights. He'd been searching for something—anything—to make him feel less alone.

"I think you have your answer. And coincidentally, my feelings for you are exactly the same."

Alexander's stare was unrelenting. "We're both adults, Sebastian. Don't be childish."

Before Sebastian could retort, a sharp knock interrupted them.

"Alexander? Sebastian? Are you in there?" Sophia's voice called from the other side.

Alexander exhaled, composing himself before walking to the door.

"Sophia," he greeted with a warm smile.

"Alexander, were you two arguing? I heard some noise. Is everything alright?" Sophia peered into the room cautiously.

"Everything's fine. Did you need something, or did you come for Sebastian?"

"Actually, I came to see you."

She hesitated before continuing in a hushed tone. "Next week, Emeric and I are attending the Elmsworth horse race. It's a high-profile event—could lead to a major business deal."

She quickly added, "I suggested Emeric take Myra or Aviana instead, but the Abernathy Group will be there. Elspeth will undoubtedly show up. Myra won't go, but Aviana might. If we all attend, the media will twist it into something else."

"Sophia, I understand. You don't need to explain. You've always been the one accompanying my father to these events because of your composure. He trusts you."

"Emeric also mentioned the Fairhaven and Chambers Groups will be attending."

Alexander's expression darkened. "I'll make sure Evadne stays away."

Sophia sighed. "I thought of that too, but Emeric insists she has to be there. Says it's important business."

"Important business?"

"I tried pressing for details, but he wouldn't say."

Sophia's worry was palpable. "Alexander, you have to be there. No matter what, we can't let anyone hurt Evadne."

"Of course. Thank you for telling me."

Once Alexander left, Sophia stepped inside.

"Sebastian, what happened? Did you fight with Alexander?"

Sebastian was gathering the scattered books, his back turned. "No. It's nothing."

"Don't lie. I heard the shouting. What were you arguing about?"

Sophia's disapproval was clear. "Alexander is the most patient man I know. In all these years, I've never seen him lose his temper. Yet you managed to provoke him in just a few days. This is your fault."

Sebastian bristled. "My fault? He's the one who wronged me!"

"Sebastian, watch your tone! You've grown reckless without guidance. You're becoming insufferable!"

"If you want to survive in the Ashbourne family, you have to play nice. But I can leave whenever I want. I don't need to kiss up to them!"

The words slipped out before he could stop them.

Sophia's face fell, her expression bitter.

An uncomfortable silence settled over the room.

Sebastian bit his lip, searching for a way to smooth things over when Sophia spoke quietly. "Sebastian, I'm sorry. I know I've brought shame upon you—upon the Bright family. I'm the stain that can never be erased."

"No, Aunt Sophia, I didn't mean—"

"I understand. I'm not fit to guide you. I'm just glad you came home this time. In the future... take care of yourself."

With that, she left, her head bowed.

"Aunt Sophia!"

Guilt twisted in his chest. He wanted to chase after her, but something caught his eye.

A fallen book had revealed a hidden compartment in the shelf.

Curiosity burned through him.

He reached inside—empty.

But the discovery sent his mind racing.

Meanwhile, after Jareth and Gordon left, Thaddeus hadn't seen Evadne emerge from her room.

Dinner came and went, but no matter how much he knocked, she refused to come out, claiming she wasn't feeling well.

Thaddeus was at a loss. She'd been fine that morning. What had changed?

He stood outside her door, wracking his brain—had he done something wrong?

No. Nothing came to mind.

Just as frustration mounted, the doorbell rang.

At the same time, Evadne's bedroom door swung open.

She stepped out in a peach silk nightgown, colliding with Thaddeus. Her forehead smacked against his chest.

"Ouch. Do you live outside my door now, Thaddeus? It's the middle of the afternoon—don't you have anything better to do?" She rubbed her forehead, her tone icy.

Thaddeus caught her shoulders, his palms damp with sweat. "I was worried about you. That's why I stayed."

He reached to check her temperature. "No fever. Is something else bothering you?"

"No."

She brushed his hand away. "Go answer the door."

With that, she sidestepped him.

Thaddeus could tell—something was off. She was distant, almost resentful.

Evadne opened the front door.

"Alva!"

"Mrs. Abernathy!"

Alva dropped her luggage and pulled Evadne into a tight embrace.

"Oh, Mrs. Abernathy! I've missed you so much!" The older woman wept like a child.

"I've missed you too, Alva. Seeing you well puts my mind at ease." Evadne patted her back, blinking back tears.

Thaddeus, who had followed, was surprised to see Alva.

He didn't need to ask—Evadne had called her.

"Alva, Thaddeus hasn't been feeling well lately, and I've been busy. I was worried I couldn't take proper care of him, so I asked you to come."

"Of course, Mrs. Abernathy!" Alva was on the verge of tears again.

She never thought she'd see Thaddeus and Evadne together like this again.

It was more than she'd ever hoped for.

Thaddeus's chest tightened.

Evadne wasn't one to rely on others or impose. He knew that better than anyone.

Yet she'd summoned Alva overnight for one reason—she didn't want to be alone with him.

She couldn't bring herself to kick him out, so she'd brought in a buffer.

The realization was a punch to the gut.

Last night, they'd been intimate.

Now, it was as if none of it had happened.

The whiplash was unbearable.

Alva immediately got to work—laundry, tidying, cooking. No amount of protest could make her rest.

After dinner, Evadne offered to clean up, but Thaddeus insisted.

"My lord, you've never done manual labor a day in your life! Let me handle this!"

"I used to do this when I was younger," Thaddeus said offhandedly.

The comment made Evadne pause.

She'd followed Thaddeus for years, yet knew almost nothing about his childhood.

While Thaddeus and Alva stayed in the kitchen, Evadne retreated to her room.

Clearly, she wanted as little interaction with him as possible.

Thaddeus felt the weight of her rejection like a physical blow.

Love made him desperate. Fearful.

"Sir, let me finish. You look unwell." Alva took the sponge from him, concern etched on her face.

"Alva... could you talk to Evadne for me?"

"Did you two have another fight?"

Thaddeus sighed. "I feel like I don't understand her at all. I can't reach her. Maybe... if you spoke to her, she'd open up."

After her bath, Evadne collapsed onto the bed with a heavy sigh.

Normally, she wouldn't let a man occupy her thoughts like this. She'd be out with friends, drowning her worries in wine.

But overhearing Thaddeus and Jareth's conversation that morning had reopened old wounds.

She didn't even want to look at Thaddeus right now.

She knew their lost child wasn't entirely his fault—but she couldn't move past it.

Not thinking about it didn't mean she'd forgotten.

A knock interrupted her thoughts. Assuming it was Thaddeus, she pulled the covers over her head.

"Mrs. Abernathy? It's Alva. I brought hot chocolate. Are you awake?"

Evadne sat up abruptly and opened the door.

Alva stood there, smiling warmly. Evadne glanced past her.

"Mr. Thaddeus isn't here. It's just me."

Flushing, Evadne let her in.

They chatted like mother and daughter. Alva's genuine care warmed Evadne's heart.

Once the hot chocolate was finished, Alva sat beside her.

"Mrs. Abernathy, Thaddeus told me everything."

Evadne stiffened. "Including Elspeth framing Cynthia?"

Alva's grip tightened, her palms suddenly clammy. "It was really her?"

Evadne realized Thaddeus had left out the most crucial detail.

Guilt gnawed at her for the slip.

Alva's eyes welled with tears. "I suspected her for years. Who else could've hurt the mistress? Acacia and Glynnis were just children—they couldn't have done it."

Evadne's gaze darkened.

Who said children couldn't commit evil?

Young Acacia and Glynnis might not have orchestrated it like Elspeth, but their cruel rumors had pushed Thaddeus's mother into despair.

Some children were just demons in waiting.

"But I had no proof. If I'd accused Elspeth, I would've been fired. Thaddeus was just a boy—what would've happened to him without me?"

Alva's guilt was palpable.

"Alva, there's something I need to ask you." Evadne hesitated. "What was Thaddeus's childhood really like?"

Alva didn't hold back.

She knew Evadne's doubts were why she kept pushing Thaddeus away.

Only by understanding him completely could Evadne truly forgive him.

So Alva told her everything—the slums, his sick mother, the humiliation, being brought to the Abernathy estate only to be scorned.

And then, the final blow—a teenage Thaddeus, shattered by his mother's death, slitting his wrists in the bathroom.

Evadne's breath hitched.

Tears spilled over, tracing silent paths down her cheeks.
###Chapter 402

"That watch Mr. Kingsley always wears? It's not for style. It hides the scar on his wrist."

As his former wife, Isabella couldn't have missed that mark.

She'd assumed it was a war wound—some battlefield honor from his military days. Never had she imagined such a tragic story lay beneath that jagged line.

"Perhaps you wonder, Isabella, why Mr. Kingsley clung so desperately to Victoria—a woman so vindictive, selfish, and vain. It's because he's fundamentally loyal. Before Victoria, he'd never been with another woman. The day he tried to end his life, she was the one who found him. Saved him. Without her intervention..." Margaret trailed off, rubbing her tired eyes. "And as a child labeled illegitimate? Schoolmates shunned him. Victoria alone stood by his side. I used to marvel at how a girl so young could show such maturity. Now we know—it was all Elspeth's manipulation. Using Victoria to control him. First she took his mother, then twisted the niece of his enemy around him. Must fate be so cruel?"

Margaret broke down, tears streaming.

Isabella stood frozen, as if struck by lightning. Numbness spread through her limbs, shock rendering her speechless.

She'd always despised Victoria.

Now she understood Alexander's obsession.

Perhaps he'd genuinely believed Victoria loved him. That she was his salvation.

No wonder he'd been blind to Isabella back then.

In his place? She might have clung just as desperately.

"Despite everything, Mr. Kingsley truly regrets the past," Margaret said, meeting Isabella's red-rimmed gaze. "He's completely let go of Victoria and the Sterlings. Daniel told me about Sunset Ridge—how you found that house. How angry you were, thinking he kept it because he still cared for her."

"Margaret." Isabella's voice came out hoarse, eyes dull.

"Daniel's usually so carefree, but that day? He wept like a child in my arms. Said if you and Mr. Kingsley couldn't reconcile, he'd consider himself a lifelong failure. Even threatened to resign after completing his current mission."

"Resign? Why?"

"He explained everything. The night Mr. Kingsley ended things with Victoria, he ordered the villa sold and every trace of her destroyed. But the Elmsworth market crashed—the property wouldn't sell. Preoccupied, Daniel forgot. When Mr. Kingsley woke there after Nathaniel brought him, and you saw... Well. He nearly ended their twenty-year friendship over it."

Isabella's breath hitched.

"Daniel's been terrified. Barely slept since. The house is handled now—everything connected to Victoria destroyed. He wants to apologize properly when the time comes. Says he'll accept any punishment you give, so long as you don't shut Mr. Kingsley out."

"That's past now." Isabella gripped Margaret's hand, voice rough. "I was angry. Couldn't stand any remnant of Victoria in his life. But with the truth known? The anger's gone. Truly."

"I believe you! Mr. Kingsley's a good man—not a wicked bone in him. His only flaw? Emotional intelligence of a rock sometimes!" Margaret's expression turned indignant. "Seeing you upset tonight—did he do something? Tell me, I'll tan his hide! Make him grovel properly!"

Tears welled in Isabella's eyes. She buried her face in Margaret's shoulder.

For a moment, she considered confessing about the baby.

But the words stuck in her throat.

"Thank you for telling me this. For caring. I'm fine. Really."

Late night. Silence.

Alexander sat alone, handsome features shadowed with sorrow.

All evening he'd wanted to check on Isabella—feared disturbing her.

Margaret hadn't explained Isabella's distress, but they'd spoken at length about Elspeth.

By the end, Margaret wept openly, yet promised discretion to avoid alerting their enemy.

Now vengeance burned bright—plans quietly unfolding.

At this critical juncture? No room for error. The slightest misstep could prevent exposing Elspeth's crimes.

"Mr. Kingsley, I sense Isabella carries some burden involving you. Since she won't share, I don't know how to help."

"And though tensions between you and Mrs. Sinclair have eased? She hasn't fully warmed. Still holds back. You must be endlessly patient. A woman's heart is fragile. Perhaps some past hurt resurfaced, making her distant. Whatever her behavior? Endure it. After all—you wronged her first."

Alexander sighed, massaging his temples.

Patience wasn't the issue.

He'd gladly spend a lifetime earning her favor.

He simply needed to understand her pain.

All night he'd agonized—heart aching, spirit drained—yet the answer eluded him.

Then—knocking.

Three light raps shattered his melancholy like sunlight through storm clouds.

Margaret had retired—her knocks more urgent.

Which meant...

His heart pounded. Three strides carried him to the door.

There stood Isabella, mesmerizing eyes locking onto his.

That scandalous pink silk robe still clung to her curves, white straps peeking provocatively. Enough to make his blood boil.

Her lips pursed tightly, flawless complexion glowing in the soft light—porcelain perfection that captivated him.

He stared, desire blazing.

Flushed like a drunkard, utterly helpless.

"Isabella."

"Can't sleep. Hungry." She avoided his heated gaze, lifting a white box. "Margaret mentioned you crave sweets when troubled. Brought cake. Want some?"

Suddenly his eyes stung. He crushed her in an embrace.

"Hey—want it or not?" She gasped against his chest.

"Isabella, I'm terrified," he whispered hoarsely.

This strong, aloof man now trembled like a scolded pup.

"Of what?"

"That you'll shut me out. The mere thought feels like daggers to my heart."

Her lashes fluttered—empathy surging.

She knew that fear intimately.

During their marriage, she'd lived it daily—terrified he'd ignore her. Leave her.

Now the tables had turned.

Entering, she opened the box. Strawberry cream cake—aroma mouthwatering.

Yet Alexander only had eyes for her.

Compared to dessert? He hungered for her.

Swiftly she portioned two slices, offering one. "Never knew you liked sweets. Never touched my pastries. Thought you despised them."

He took a large bite, throat working.

"Sweet. Thank you."

"Easy—no one's stealing it." She attempted levity. "Can have mine too."

He craved sweets because his childhood lacked them.

Back then? Candy was luxury. Cake? Unthinkable.

Later, as Abernathy heir, he could have anything.

But human nature? We covet what's denied. Once obtained? Interest wanes.

"Will I ever taste your pastries again?" he ventured.

Her heart skipped. She only smiled.

He forced a grin. "Fine. I'll learn to bake for you."

"Tomorrow." She speared a strawberry, feigning nonchalance.

"Tomorrow I'll make some."

"Me. I'll shop with Margaret. Bake for you." Cream on her tongue, lashes fluttering, voice soft.

His eyes lit up—brighter than Christmas morning.

"I'll join! Bake together!"

"Suit yourself."

His boyish excitement made her laugh. Then—disaster.

Cream splattered her décolletage.

"Oh!"

The silky dollop slid between her breasts, staining pink silk.

Alexander stared—her exposed curves whiter, more tempting than any frosting.

Breath ragged, blood pounding. Lips quivered with barely restrained hunger.

"Tissue? Hello—ah!"

Suddenly he was upon her, body pressing hers. Then—warmth. Shockingly, his mouth traced the cream's path, tongue lapping her skin.

Each hot, wet stroke electrified. His hand slid up her arm. Mind buzzing, body tingling, vision blurring. As she arched back, one thought surfaced: Damn you, Alexander Kingsley—you absolute animal!

Only when every trace vanished did he lift his head, gaze molten. "Better solution, no?"

"N-not at all."

Her chest now bloomed with love bites!

Flustered, she turned away—breath uneven, skin glistening.

He fared no better—both looked thoroughly ravished.

Different only in degree of composure.

"Alexander Kingsley, you overstep!" Pink lips pouted adorably.

That petulant tone—almost a whimper—undid him.

Torn between arousal and fear of her anger.

"Isabella, forgive me. Won't happen again."

Then—vision blurred.

Her arms encircled his neck. Slender waist arched against him.

Summoning courage, those rosebud lips silenced him—cherry tongue exploring his mouth with devastating ease.

Against her? Body and mind, he stood defenseless.

Alexander shuddered—heart wild, thoughts scattering.

His queen—nobility incarnate—bestowing her loyal subject's first kiss.

Reward. Coronation. Honor. Bliss worth dying for!

No longer restrained, his grip on her waist tightened—kissing back with near-brutal intensity.

Mouths tasting of copper—neither cared. Devouring as if tomorrow might never come.

Moonlight bathed their entwined shadows in romantic glow.

Passion's peak found their fingers interlacing—like true lovers.

After last night's lovemaking, then this? He feared her delicate frame might break, though his hunger remained unsated.

Dazed in his arms, Isabella struggled to describe this exhaustion laced with euphoria.

Gazing down, Alexander finally voiced his longing.

"Isabella, could we—"

"Hmm?"

He hesitated. Then—a bitter chuckle.

"Never mind. This is enough. Perfect."

She nestled closer, eyes drifting shut.

Truthfully? She knew his unspoken question.

But tonight? She wouldn't make answering easy.

Alexander sighed, kissing her forehead. "Isabella, whether you love me, want me—that's your choice. But I'll always be yours. Always love you."
###Chapter 403

The tension between them was palpable, even without physical intimacy. Every corner of the mansion seemed to hum with the unspoken passion that made Seraphina's cheeks flush and her pulse race.

Margaret prepared their meals three times a day. Seraphina, unwilling to let her shoulder the burden alone, insisted on helping. But both Margaret and Nathaniel stopped her.

"You're allergic to smoke, Seraphina. Stay out of the kitchen. I'll help Margaret. You can just wait for the meal," Nathaniel said. He stood behind her, his arms encircling her waist, his chin resting on her shoulder. Unable to resist, he pressed a kiss to her flushed earlobe.

In front of Margaret, Seraphina turned as red as a ripe strawberry, squirming in his embrace. "Don't act all heroic, Nathaniel. You're a pampered CEO. What can you even do?"

"I can learn," Nathaniel replied, a smirk playing on his lips. He leaned in, whispering in her ear, "I'm a fast learner, Seraphina. The other night... well, you know exactly how well I performed."

"You—stop it! If you keep talking like that, I'll step on your foot!" Seraphina's face burned, but there was nowhere to hide. Nathaniel had her completely wrapped in his arms.

Margaret watched with a warm smile, her heart swelling as if witnessing her own children sharing a tender moment.

In just a few days, Seraphina and Nathaniel's relationship had heated up rapidly.

They exchanged good mornings and good nights. They did chores together, even grocery shopping at the nearby supermarket.

To avoid unwanted attention, they wore hats and masks when they went out. After all, if the CEO of Vanderbilt Industries and the heiress of the Sinclair family were spotted together like an ordinary couple, the tabloids would explode. The shockwaves would rival two A-list celebrities announcing their engagement.

Not to mention the business world would be thrown into chaos, potentially affecting stock prices and major projects for both families.

These days, Nathaniel had swapped his usual tailored suits for comfortable business casual wear. But even in relaxed attire, he still stood out in a crowd, effortlessly commanding attention.

Today, the couple was at the supermarket, picking out groceries. It was a large warehouse-style store, and since it wasn’t the weekend, the crowd was sparse.

Seraphina had cooked for Nathaniel for years and knew his tastes well. She carefully selected ingredients that catered to his preferences.

Despite her sharp tongue, her actions betrayed her feelings for him.

Nathaniel felt this was the happiest, most fulfilling time of his thirty years.

He should have had this happiness three years ago, when he still had the right to it.

He followed silently behind Seraphina, watching her examine products on the shelves—checking ingredients, expiration dates. Her meticulousness showed no sign of a spoiled heiress. She was thorough, considerate.

His wife.

She might not be his wife now, but she would be.

Suddenly, a mother walked past them, pushing a cart with a little boy perched inside. The two were laughing, chatting happily.

"Seraphina," Nathaniel called, his eyes gleaming.

"What?" she asked, glancing at him.

He pointed at the shopping cart. "Get in. I'll push you."

Seraphina blinked.

"You've been walking for a while. It'll be easier for you. Just point out what you want, and I'll grab it."

"No way, that's ridiculous!" Seraphina took a step back, horrified.

"Come on. Don't worry about me. I won't get tired."

Nathaniel was growing bolder, more assertive—more like the CEO he was.

"I'm not worried about you! I just think it's embarrassing. Look around—do you see anyone over ten sitting in a cart?"

Seraphina shot him a disdainful look, turned on her heel, and walked away.

The moment she turned, her cheeks burned, her lips pressed together.

Nathaniel followed obediently, sighing inwardly.

Even though they had crossed certain lines, he could tell she hadn’t fully accepted him yet. The natural intimacy of a couple wouldn’t happen unless he initiated it.

She had given him her body, but her heart had only cracked open slightly.

Nathaniel clenched his fist, determination burning in his chest.

It’s fine. Things are getting better.

"Wow, look at that couple! They're stunning! The woman is gorgeous, and the man is so handsome! Are they models?"

A pair of passersby whispered excitedly.

"They're dressed so well. How can you even tell they're attractive?"

"Just look at their posture, their aura, their perfect proportions. Their faces have to match!"

"Who knows? The woman might have a face like a gargoyle, and the man might be a 'shrimp boyfriend.'"

The words reached the couple in question.

Seraphina gritted her teeth, itching to rip off her mask and shove her flawless face in theirs.

"Seraphina, what's a 'shrimp boyfriend'?" Nathaniel asked, curiosity flickering in his dark eyes.

"When you eat shrimp, what part do you not eat?" she snapped.

"The head."

"Exactly. It means a man who's only good for his body—implying he's ugly."

"Ah." Nathaniel nodded, as if filing away this new knowledge. "You're so clever, Seraphina."

Her mind was always full of sharp wit and fresh perspectives. Sometimes, he wished he could peek inside her brain just to understand how she thought.

Just then, the passersby continued.

"Ugh, what a waste. A guy that handsome, and he's already taken? Such a waste of resources!"

Seraphina's fists clenched.

How was she the waste? If anything, he was the lucky one!

"How do you even know they're together? They've kept their distance this whole time—not a single touch. Maybe they're siblings?"

"That's called couple's resemblance. You wouldn't get it!"

Nathaniel's brow furrowed, his jaw tightening.

"Come on, let's go. Margaret's waiting for us to start dinner," Seraphina nudged him, about to walk away—when suddenly, his hand closed around her wrist.

In the next second, she was pulled into his arms, his chest rising and falling like stormy waves.

Before she could react, his warm hand slid to her waist, gripping her possessively.

As she looked up in shock, Nathaniel's lips—hot and demanding—crushed against hers, ignoring the gasps around them.

The bystanders couldn’t help but sigh at the romantic display.

Even through the masks, the passion was undeniable.

Seraphina's small fists, pressed against his shoulders, slowly relaxed. Her tense body melted into his.

The onlookers eventually dispersed, embarrassed at witnessing such a public display.

When they finally pulled apart, Nathaniel's gaze was dark with emotion.

"You—you're too bold," Seraphina breathed, her lips tingling.

"I wanted to, so I did," Nathaniel murmured, adjusting her slightly mussed hair. "I didn’t think about it."

"What if someone recognizes us?"

"If they were going to, they would’ve the moment we walked in."

He wasn’t a saint. He had possessive instincts, especially when it came to the woman he loved. How could he stay silent when others spoke like that?

Seraphina, sharp as ever, saw right through him.

Teasingly, she pursed her lips. "What if people assume we're a couple now?"

Nathaniel stared at her, his gaze intense. Then he leaned in, his lips brushing her ear.

"I didn’t kiss you to let them know you're mine. I did it to tell them I am yours."

Seraphina's heart pounded, her cheeks burning beneath the mask.

She playfully punched his chest and left it at that.

Just then, her phone rang.

A second later, Nathaniel’s chimed in sync.

They took their calls separately.

"Hello? Adrian?"

"Seraphina, Cassandra’s autopsy is complete. The funeral is tomorrow." Adrian’s voice was somber.

Seraphina inhaled deeply. "Okay."

"Also, Sebastian and Dominic convinced her grandmother to stay at our rehabilitation center in Skyrim. It was her choice. After all, Elmsworth is where Cassandra died. Skyrim is by the sea—better climate, and it’s our territory. Easier to care for her."

"Good. I think Skyrim is best for her. Thank you."

Seraphina’s eyes glistened with sorrow. "I’ll be at Cassandra’s funeral first thing tomorrow. But keep it low-key. We don’t need media swarming and distressing the elderly."

"Don’t worry. The police have sealed the case. Sebastian used his influence to suppress the news. We’ve got it handled."

On Nathaniel’s end—

"Bro! We’ve got a lead on that bastard Dominic! He’s already smuggled himself into Country T, landed last night!"

"Keep eyes on him. Don’t lose him." Nathaniel lowered his voice. "What about the police? Are they in Country T yet?"

"Not yet. My men got there first!"

"Good. Tomorrow, you’re coming with me to Country T." Nathaniel’s eyes burned with fury.

"What? So sudden!"

"If you can’t leave Genevieve, send someone else. I’ll go alone."

"No, no. If you’re going, I’m with you. My biggest regret was not joining you on the battlefield back then. Well, that and letting my damn sister come back from Aetheria!"

Whenever he thought of Arabella, frustration boiled in him.

"I want Dominic before the police get him."

Men in love had a competitive streak.

They ended their calls almost simultaneously and turned back to each other.

"Tomorrow morning, we’ll attend Cassandra’s funeral together," Seraphina said, her eyes red-rimmed.

"Okay. Together."

Nathaniel hesitated, then—like a husband about to leave for a business trip—pulled her close.

"Seraphina, tomorrow I have an important meeting at the company. As CEO, I have to be there. I’ll be gone a few days."

"How many?"

"Five. Maybe ten."

Nathaniel felt guilty lying, even if it was a white one.

Seraphina’s eyes gleamed. "Where?"

"Aetheria." The word slipped out before he could stop it.

"Alright. Safe travels." Her expression remained calm.

Suddenly, Nathaniel hugged her tightly, reluctance thick in his voice. "Seraphina, wait for me to come back."

She didn’t answer—but slowly, her arms wrapped around him in return.

That was answer enough.

The night was misty, the moon hanging low.

Even though it was early spring, the recent rain had kept the air unusually cold.

"Tomorrow morning, the maid from the Vanderbilt family will be laid to rest."

In the lavish room of The Velvet Haven, Reginald sat on the sofa, swirling red wine, his back to Lawrence.

"Oh?"

"Ms. Seraphina will definitely go. After all, the maid took a bullet for her. And if Ms. Seraphina is going, won’t Nathaniel follow?"

Lawrence stepped closer. "Will you attend?"

"It’s just a maid. Even if she saved Seraphina, is it worth making a fuss?"

Reginald sipped his wine, his glasses hiding his cold, mocking gaze. "If she hadn’t taken that bullet, she’d have died a nobody. But now? Because of her choice, she’s Seraphina’s savior. Seraphina’s kindness will remember her forever. Her family will live comfortably off her sacrifice. However you look at it, her death was worth more than her life."

Lawrence listened silently, a chill running down his spine.

That was Reginald—twisting even the cruelest words into something that sounded reasonable.

His cruelty was subtle.

He always smiled gently, making people feel at ease—until they crossed him. Then he struck like a snake, ensuring they suffered before they died.

Reginald drained his glass, sorrow weighing on his heart.

It wasn’t that he didn’t want to go. He missed Seraphina—missed her so much it kept him awake at night.

But showing up unannounced would only deepen her resentment.

He had already lost to Nathaniel once. He couldn’t afford to lose again.

Just then, the door opened.

Audrey walked in, head bowed, holding a brown envelope.

"Mr. Vanderbilt, the man you sent has returned with something."
###Chapter 404

Avery turned away, his pale fingers flicking dismissively.

Elsie bit her lip and passed the envelope to Harvey, who handed it to Avery.

Once, she'd been the only woman besides Evadne allowed near him. She could sit in his lap, tease him, share jokes—and he'd never lose his temper.

Everyone assumed he favored her. They treated her like royalty.

Only Elsie knew the truth. She was nothing. Not even fit to lace Evadne's shoes.

To Avery, she was just a cheap stand-in. A plaything. When he was amused, he'd indulge her. When angered, he'd crush her without hesitation. One snap of his fingers, and her world would shatter.

So she kept her distance now. Even meeting his gaze filled her with dread.

Harvey presented the envelope with both hands.

Avery set down his glass, took it, and leisurely unfolded the contents.

Then—

A storm erupted.

Avery shot to his feet, his entire body radiating a chilling fury. Harvey and Elsie stumbled back, trembling.

A deafening crash followed.

Avery roared, eyes bloodshot, and kicked the coffee table over.

Expensive wine and crystal shattered across the floor.

"Damn bastard!"

He hurled the photo into the air, his rage burning like wildfire.

Harvey and Elsie caught it—and froze.

Even prepared, the image stunned them.

Thaddeus and Evadne. Locked in a passionate kiss.

"How? Why?"

Avery clutched his chest, shaking. It felt like a bomb had detonated inside him, obliterating everything.

"She hated him! She despised him in front of me! Why? Why are they together?"

"Sir, please—calm down!" Harvey tried to soothe him. "It might be a mistake. Maybe our informant misread the situation—"

"I know Evadne." Avery pressed a hand to his burning forehead, collapsing onto the couch. "If she dislikes someone, she won't even glance their way. Even if they didn't kiss—he held her. They were shopping together."

His breath came in ragged gasps. Tears spilled over, unchecked.

Harvey and Elsie stared, stunned.

In all their years with him, they'd never seen Avery cry over a woman. Never seen him so shattered.

How deeply must he love her?

Yet Evadne chose the man who'd abandoned and hurt her over giving Avery a second chance.

Harvey shot Elsie a pointed look.

But she kept her head down, not daring to move closer.

Once, as a stand-in, she could've comforted him.

Now, she knew better.

Evadne's shadow eclipsed everything. No one could replace her, not even temporarily.

Avery demanded the syringe. Only drugs could numb this pain now.

Otherwise, he might storm out and put a bullet in Thaddeus right in front of Evadne.

"Sir," Harvey said cautiously, putting the syringe away, "you should avoid this. It's untested—dangerous."

"I know. Just this once." Avery closed his eyes. "A drug lord controlled by drugs? Pathetic."

His real addiction wasn't the needle.

It was Evadne.

"Send these photos to Emeric. Anonymously." Avery's smile turned vicious. "He adores his daughter. He won't let her throw herself back into the fire."

Harvey nodded.

As he turned to leave, Avery stopped him. "What's today's date?"

"March 6th, sir."

Avery's eyes gleamed in the dark.

"March 6th."

His phone rang.

That evening, Evadne was unusually understanding. After dinner, she retired early, giving Thaddeus space.

Alone in his room, Thaddeus made call after call, coordinating with Jareth and his team for tomorrow's trip.

"Did Cassius send people too?"

"No word yet. But if we know, he knows. He won't sit idle."

Thaddeus nodded. "I need to catch Ward first."

"Does it matter who gets him? Don't be so competitive." Jareth sighed. Thaddeus had always hated losing.

Otherwise, he wouldn't have fought Evadne so viciously in the past. Now, he probably regretted it—almost lost her for good.

"Evadne has everything. I have nothing to give her." Thaddeus' voice cracked. "Right now, she wants revenge. So I'll make sure she gets it. Whatever it takes."

"Fine. But in Country T, my men will protect you."

"Don't worry about me. I was military. Watch your own back."

Thaddeus paused. "If anything happens to you, Mari would be devastated. You're everything to her."

Jareth gasped. "Thad! Does that mean you accept me as your brother-in-law?"

Thaddeus scowled. "Stop yelling. It's midnight."

"Brother-in-law!" Jareth crooned.

"Act human."

"Once we're back safely, I'm proposing. You have to help me!"

Thaddeus smirked. "The Fairhavens are elite. Frederic can't refuse. Elspeth won't have a say—she's about to lose all rights."

"Right."

"Get me a gun."

Jareth choked. Thaddeus asked as casually as ordering cutlery.

"Country T is lawless. Ward's allies could be waiting. We can't risk it."

Silence fell.

Then Frederic called.

Thaddeus' expression darkened as he answered.

"Tomorrow, Aether Dynamics' chairman is meeting us remotely. Strategic cooperation talks. You will attend."

"I can't. I have plans."

"Postpone them! This is critical!"

"No."

Frederic slammed his desk. "As president, you're irresponsible! Useless!"

"Am I?" Thaddeus chuckled coldly. "Aside from making you Elmsworth's richest man a decade early?"

Frederic seethed.

"Anything else? I'm busy."

"One day, you'll pay for this neglect!"

Thaddeus hung up, unfazed.

He cared about Abernathy Group. It was his life's work.

But Evadne came first.

The next morning, they dressed in solemn black.

At the villa's entrance, their eyes met.

Thaddeus studied Evadne—her custom suit, the white flower pinned to her lapel, her unpainted lips.

Beautiful. Poised. Heartbreakingly sad.

He'd always wanted to tell her:

The first time he saw her post-divorce, in that suit with red lips, his heart had raced.

"Good morning, Thaddeus."

"Morning, Evadne."

"Let's go."

His eyes burned. Blood pounded.

With Jason still hospitalized, Gordon drove them.

In the backseat, Thaddeus took Evadne's cold hand.

She didn't pull away.

"Jareth wanted to come. I refused."

"I understand. Mari would worry." Evadne sighed. "Erica was her friend."

Her voice broke.

"Don't cry." Thaddeus pulled her close. "Erica wouldn't want this. She'd want you strong."

Evadne leaned into him, drawing strength.

Erica's funeral was grand. Wreaths lined the entrance—Ashbourne, Abernathy, Fairhaven. Even Avery's, ostentatious and front-row.

Arnold scoffed. "That Chambers brat. Acting like it's his family's funeral."

Cassius shook his head. "Leave it. Let's not seem petty."

The Ashbourne brothers were all present. Even Jason, wheelchair-bound, pushed by Nydia.

She'd rushed to the hospital upon hearing of his injury, refusing to leave his side.

"Jason!" Cassius chided. "Evadne will be furious seeing you here."

"Erica saved her life. I had to come."

Arnold teased Nydia. "Can't control your man?"

Both blushed.

"Ashbourne women rule their men," Elvis added. "Right, Jason?"

"Absolutely."

Then—

"Miss Ashbourne has arrived!"

"Mr. Thaddeus Abernathy is here!"
###Chapter 405

The chapel was filled only with members of the Sinclair family today.

Alexander stood composed beside Isabella, his demeanor unshaken despite being the sole outsider present. If anything, this was the moment he needed to be her unwavering pillar of strength.

He wanted Isabella to feel completely secure, to know she could rely on him without reservation.

Behind them, Daniel trailed nervously, sweating under the intense gazes of all five Sinclair brothers. Note to self: never marry into a family with so many protective older brothers.

"Isabella!" The brothers rushed forward, surrounding their sister.

Their expressions toward Alexander were noticeably less hostile than before—progress from the cold shoulders they'd once given him.

"Thank you for everything these past few days," Isabella said softly before turning to Natalie, who was pushing Sebastian in his wheelchair. "And thank you, Natalie, for taking such good care of Sebastian."

"We're family," Natalie replied warmly, touched by Isabella's gratitude.

"Sebastian," Isabella took his hand in her left and Natalie's in her right, linking them together firmly, "get well soon and treat my sister right. From now on, the person you protect with your life should be Natalie."

Tears glistened in Sebastian's eyes as he looked past Isabella to the towering figure of Alexander behind her.

Yes. It was time to step back.

His girl had found someone far stronger to shield her now.

Alexander watched Isabella's slender yet resilient frame, his heart swelling. He ached to pull her close and declare to the world—she needed no one else.

The ceremony began.

Then Oliver burst in, face grim. "Isabella! Reporters just swarmed the gates. Someone leaked the memorial details!"

"What?" Isabella's eyes flashed. "Oliver, you're meticulous. No family member would've done this!"

"Our security says the guards outside are from Vanderbilt Industries." Oliver's gaze flicked meaningfully to Alexander.

"Not me," Alexander stated coldly.

"I know." Isabella raised a silencing hand. "If I doubted you, you wouldn't be here."

Alexander's chest tightened at her trust.

"Only Eloise and Giselle benefit from this. They know exactly how Emily died. They've been waiting for this moment—another chance to perform for the cameras and rehabilitate their image. But crashing a Sinclair memorial? They're digging their own graves."

Her commanding presence silenced all objections. Even Alexander and Oliver felt a chill.

"Ms. Isabella." Emily's grandmother trembled behind her. "Is something wrong?"

Isabella spun around, her anger melting into tenderness as she rushed to comfort the elderly woman. "Don't worry, Grandma. We're all here for you. Nothing will disturb Emily's peace."

Outside the chapel, reporters jostled for shots of the memorial—this was headline gold! Vanderbilts and Sinclairs together at a maid's funeral? The implications were explosive!

Just as Isabella predicted.

Eloise and Giselle had orchestrated this media circus.

Inside a black limo, Eloise dabbed pale powder on her cheeks, perfecting her grieving widow look. "Mother, must we really attend?" Giselle fretted, eyeing the chapel windows. "We always lose against Isabella. And with Emily freshly dead—shouldn't we lay low?"

"Lay low? It's too late for that," Eloise snapped her compact shut, her ghostly pallor accentuating her venomous glare. "If Isabella had proof, she'd have struck already. No evidence means she can't touch us."

Giselle nodded. Isabella's ruthless efficiency was legendary—if she'd had ammunition, the Vanderbilts would already be in ruins.

"Besides," Eloise smoothed her dress, "as Emily's employer, skipping her funeral makes me look heartless. This is our chance to win public sympathy." She eyed the envelope in Giselle's hands. "The compensation money?"

"Ready. But must we give so much?"

"Darling, it's pocket change to keep that secret buried."

Stepping out, they transformed into grieving saints, tears materializing on cue for the cameras.

"Eloise! Was the victim really your personal maid?" a reporter shoved a mic forward.

"Yes," Eloise dabbed her eyes with a lace handkerchief. "Emily was such a kind soul. Worked tirelessly for our family."

"Though she attended Giselle, I treated her like a sister," Giselle sniffled dramatically, subtly throwing Margaret under the bus.

The reporters ate it up. "Ms. Giselle, your compassion despite your status is remarkable!"

"As her employer, attending is my duty," Eloise proclaimed to the flashing cameras.

"And how will you handle this tragedy?"

"We accept partial responsibility for not safeguarding our staff better. This compensation is but a token of our remorse. May she rest peacefully."

The media's approval was palpable—their Vanderbilt redemption arc was working.

Then the chapel doors swung open.

All color drained from Eloise and Giselle's faces.

The Sinclair siblings stood like a thunderstorm given human form, with Isabella and Alexander at the forefront—their identical crimson gazes burning with murderous intent.

Giselle whimpered, suddenly finding it hard to breathe under Isabella's piercing glare.

"Ms. Isabella," Eloise forced composure, "the deceased deserves respect. Whatever our past, we're here only to pay respects."

Isabella took one step forward.

The Sinclair army advanced in unison, forcing the Vanderbilts back. Even the reporters recoiled—nobody crossed the Sinclairs lightly.

The brothers formed an impenetrable shield behind Isabella. Hidden in shadows, Oliver's hand twitched toward his concealed weapon—one wrong move, and the Vanderbilts would drop where they stood.

"Everyone may mourn Emily," Isabella's voice dripped venom. "Except you two."

"Why not?" Giselle squeaked.

"Because you're unworthy."

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

"Isabella! You can't—"

"Did I stutter?" Isabella tilted her head, a predator toying with prey. "Your presence here desecrates her memory."

Eloise's nails dug into her palms. "We came in good faith. Must you politicize a funeral? It disrespects the dead and embarrasses both families."

Isabella laughed coldly. "The only ones disturbing Emily's peace are you. Standing here, you stain her vision. Eloise. Giselle." Her voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "You know what you did to Emily. Do you truly believe you'll escape retribution?"

The room erupted in shocked murmurs. Cameras clicked furiously—was Isabella implying the Vanderbilts killed their maid?

Alexander's arm slid around Isabella's waist, feeling her tremble with rage. He squeezed gently, wordlessly promising: I'm here. Burn them to the ground.

Eloise and Giselle's masks cracked, panic twisting their features. Their media allies suddenly felt like vipers turning in their hands.

"Isabella!" Eloise's voice shook. "Are you accusing us of murder?"

"Did I say that?" Isabella feigned innocence. "I merely mentioned karma, and you jumped to conclusions. Guilty conscience?"

The reporters' lenses zoomed in on the Vanderbilts' ashen faces.

"You—" Giselle spluttered, "You're slandering us! We'll sue!"

"Stating facts isn't slander." Isabella's smile was glacial. "I know your crimes intimately—because I lived with the Vanderbilts for three years as Alexander's wife."

The bombshell detonated in silence.

Reporters froze. Eloise and Giselle gaped. Even Alexander and the Sinclair brothers stiffened in shock.

"Isabella—" Alexander began.

She cut him off. "No one knows your evil better than I do. Because I was there. As part of your family."
###Chapter 406

The revelation struck like lightning, plunging the crowd into stunned silence.

"Seraphina." Her brothers exchanged uneasy glances.

They never expected Seraphina, who had always treated her failed marriage as a forbidden topic, to openly admit—right in front of the flashing cameras—that she and Nathaniel had once been married.

Fearless. Unapologetic.

Once, she had seen their divorce as a stain on her life, something too painful to acknowledge.

But now, she had shed that weight.

She and Nathaniel had simply met at the wrong time.

Yet fate had brought them back together.

The next moment, the media frenzy erupted. Cameras flashed relentlessly, drowning them in blinding light. Nathaniel immediately stepped in front of Seraphina, shielding her from the invasive glare.

"Ms. Seraphina! Is it true you and Mr. Nathaniel were once married?"

"Was it a secret wedding? When did you divorce? Do you have children?"

"Why did the marriage end? Was it because of Cassandra’s interference? Was there infidelity?"

The reporters hurled questions like daggers, each sharper than the last.

"Yes, we divorced. But Seraphina did nothing wrong. The fault was entirely mine."

Nathaniel’s chest ached as he prepared to shoulder the blame, but Seraphina suddenly tightened her grip on his hand.

He met her unwavering gaze.

"You don’t owe them an explanation," she murmured, her voice low and rough near his ear. "It’s in the past. I don’t need your justification, and I never want to hear that name again."

Nathaniel’s throat tightened, the pain unbearable.

Her resentment would have been easier to bear than this quiet understanding.

"As for the reason Nathaniel and I divorced, that’s private," Seraphina stated coolly, then turned her piercing gaze back to Eleanor and her daughter. "I’m telling you this to prove my accusations aren’t baseless. I witnessed Eleanor and Giselle’s cruelty firsthand. Don’t let their masks fool you. Focus on the victims."

Her words rang with conviction.

"I believe every journalist here entered this field to seek truth—to expose injustice and give voice to the voiceless. There are countless shadows in this world where light doesn’t reach. If even the media won’t speak for them, who will?"

Her impassioned speech silenced the room.

These reporters had once been idealists, driven by purpose.

But Elmsworth’s media landscape was controlled by corporate interests, stifling truth. The era of viral gossip had lured them toward sensationalism—celebrity scandals, billionaire drama—anything for clicks.

Heroes were forgotten, while tabloid fodder thrived.

Then, one journalist bravely turned the mic on Eleanor. "Mrs. Eleanor, is it true, as Ms. Seraphina claims, that you abused your staff? Did Erica suffer unjust treatment before her death?"

Eleanor stiffened.

She hadn’t expected the media she’d invited to turn against her.

Nathaniel squeezed Seraphina’s hand.

"You’re incredible," he murmured. "Far stronger than I’ll ever be. I don’t deserve you."

He leaned closer, his breath warm against her ear. "For thirteen years, you followed me. For the rest of our lives, let me follow you."

Seraphina’s pulse skipped. Her fingers curled around his.

Other reporters joined the interrogation, surrounding Eleanor and Giselle.

The mother-daughter duo broke into cold sweats, stammering denials. "No! That’s not true! Don’t listen to her lies!"

"Mrs. Eleanor, what do you have to say for yourself now?"

A familiar voice cut through the chaos—fierce, righteous.

Seraphina and Nathaniel turned sharply.

It was Althea.

"Althea!"

"Mrs. Sinclair, Mr. Nathaniel."

Althea approached, her eyes red-rimmed. "I’m sorry. I came against your wishes. But Erica was like a daughter to me. I couldn’t stay away."

Nathaniel sighed. "We should’ve told you."

Seraphina pulled Althea into a wordless embrace.

After a moment, Althea glared at Eleanor, venom in her voice. "Every word Ms. Seraphina said is true. Not just Erica—countless Abernathy staff have suffered under Eleanor’s abuse. I’ve worked here thirty years. I know things even Ms. Seraphina doesn’t. I swear on my life, she hasn’t lied."

"Althea, have you lost your mind?" Eleanor shrieked. "After all we’ve done for you!"

Althea scoffed. "The only kindness I received came from Mr. Nathaniel and Miss Seraphina. Not you."

The crowd buzzed—a maid publicly defying a socialite.

"This is disgraceful," one reporter muttered. "Funerals should be private, especially for tragic deaths. The fact that Ms. Seraphina and Mr. Nathaniel kept this quiet proves their respect for the dead."

"Unlike Eleanor, who craves the spotlight."

"Exploiting the deceased for publicity—how vile."

Cornered, Eleanor clutched her chest dramatically. "You’re twisting my words!"

She pointed a trembling finger at Seraphina. "When you were married to Nathaniel, we clashed. But that’s in the past! Why can’t you let go?"

Seraphina’s expression turned glacial.

Nathaniel’s jaw clenched, a vein throbbing at his temple.

Eleanor’s voice dripped venom. "You knew Nathaniel loved Cassandra. You forced your way into their lives! Of course the marriage failed. And now you blame me?"

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

Was Eleanor the victim here?

Seraphina’s brothers seethed. Even Elias, lurking in the shadows, fingered a poison needle, ready to silence Eleanor permanently.

"We should eject these reporters," Adrian growled.

Cassius stopped him. "Too late. Some are live-streaming. If we act now, we’ll look guilty."

Eleanor had set a trap.

Nathaniel stepped forward, his voice icy. "You were never my mother. Seraphina endured your abuse for three years—yet she still treated you with respect. Why omit that?"

Seraphina’s nails dug into her palms, old wounds reopening.

Nathaniel squeezed her hand, his grip firm. "And Seraphina married me out of love. Is that a crime? The fault was mine—for not seeing Cassandra’s true nature, for hurting Seraphina, for failing to realize I’d fallen for her."

The cameras went wild.

The CEO of Sinclair Holdings had just admitted to infidelity—to protect his ex-wife.

Eleanor paled. Giselle gaped.

They’d underestimated Nathaniel’s love.

He’d rather shatter himself than let her bear a single scar.

Seraphina’s lips trembled. His unwavering defense moved her more than any confession.

"This is the last time I’ll say this," Nathaniel declared, his gaze sweeping the crowd. "Our divorce was my fault. If any media outlet slanders Seraphina, I will destroy them."

His words reverberated like thunder.

Eleanor and Giselle shrank back.

Adrian smirked. "Damn. Respect."

Cassius and Adrian nodded in approval.

Elias exhaled smoke, amused. "Finally acting like a man."

Then, a reporter dared to ask, "Mr. Nathaniel, if you’re divorced, why do you still protect her? Do you still have feelings for Ms. Seraphina?"

Nathaniel’s eyes burned. "Once, she was my wife. Now, I’m hers."

Their gazes locked, tears unshed.
###Chapter 407

The moment was electric.

Isabella didn't look away from Alexander's piercing gaze—those eyes brimming with raw emotion, shimmering like stars in the night sky.

Her heart raced. How deeply did he love her? Every time their eyes met, his would glisten, as if he were on the verge of tears.

Meanwhile, Victoria and her daughter stood trapped—blocked by Isabella and Alexander in front, swarmed by reporters behind. Their discomfort was palpable, their faces twisted in barely contained fury.

Then, Olivia stepped forward.

With a swift motion, she pulled out her phone and played a recording for all to hear.

Silence fell.

The voice that crackled through the speakers was unmistakable—Victoria's, laced with venom, spewing abuse at the household staff.

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

"Oh my God! Someone record this!"

"Is this how a socialite behaves? Even street vendors have more class!"

"This is going viral—no doubt about it!"

Amelia paled. She had tormented the staff too. What if her voice was next?

"Ladies and gentlemen, feast your eyes on the 'gracious' Victoria in her natural habitat!" Olivia taunted, waving her phone. "Kindness? Generosity? What a joke!"

"You wretched old hag! How dare you set me up!" Victoria shrieked, lunging for the phone.

But the Sinclair family bodyguards moved like a wall, shielding Olivia.

The media captured every second—Victoria's unhinged rage, her humiliation laid bare.

"One recording not enough, my dear?" Olivia smirked. "I've got dozens more. Years of your tyranny, all documented."

She played another.

A sharp slap echoed first.

Then Victoria's shrill voice: "Erica, you useless fool! The Abernathys don't tolerate incompetence!"

Victoria trembled, her face draining of color.

Erica's pained whimper followed. "I'm sorry, madam. I'll clean it up right—Ah!"

The recording cut deep.

Amelia's voice chimed in next, just as cruel. "Erica! Are you deaf? Move!"

Solid proof. Undeniable.

"Who gave you the right to abuse your staff?" Arnold roared, veins bulging. Cassius and Aaron barely restrained him.

"Arnold's terrifying when angry," Elvis muttered, shaking his head.

Isabella's eyes burned with fury, her throat tight.

Alexander pulled her close, his grip firm yet gentle. But the tension in his arms betrayed his own simmering rage.

Victoria and Amelia stood exposed, the media frenzy swelling around them.

"Let's go—now!" Victoria hissed, dragging Amelia toward the exit.

But fate had other plans.

A sudden gust of cold air swept past Isabella and Alexander.

They turned—just in time to see Erica's grandmother, face stone-cold, dump a bowl of scalding risotto over Victoria's head.

A scream tore through the air.

Victoria writhed, her scalp burning. The stench clung to her, humiliation complete.

Amelia, splattered too, gagged violently.

The crowd froze. Even Isabella and Alexander were stunned.

The frail old woman, bedridden days ago from grief, now stood tall—her frail frame radiating unshakable strength.

"Get out!" she snarled, clutching the empty bowl like a weapon. "You disgrace my granddaughter's memory!"

Her voice cracked but held steel. "I've lost everything. I won't hesitate to crack your skulls open!"

Victoria and Amelia fled, their grand exit reduced to a狼狈 retreat.

The reporters chased after them, hungry for more scandal.

Despite the chaos, Erica's funeral proceeded with dignity.

Her grandmother collapsed afterward, overwhelmed. The Sinclairs rushed her to the hospital, ensuring she received the best care.

In the lounge, Isabella sat stiffly, her expression dark.

They had won this battle. But the recordings of Victoria and Amelia's cruelty still haunted her, making her tremble with rage.

Cassius and Arnold handled damage control with the press. Though Alexander had already warned the media, precautions were necessary.

Aaron wanted to stay but duty called—cases piled up at the precinct.

Only the young couple—Jason and Nydia—Elvis, and Alexander remained with Isabella.

"Is the AC on? It's freezing," Isabella murmured, rubbing her arms.

Nydia frowned. "It's not. Are you okay? I'll get you a blanket."

Before she could move, Alexander shrugged off his suit jacket and draped it over Isabella's shoulders. His touch was tender, reverent.

She looked up, meeting his gaze—those deep eyes searching hers, as if peering into her soul.

"I understand," he whispered. "I understand you."

Simple words. Yet they unraveled her.

"I'm just cold," she lied, voice cracking.

Alexander pulled her into his arms, enveloping her completely. "Better?"

She shook her head slightly, melting into him.

"You'll never be cold again," he vowed, voice thick with emotion. "Not while I'm here."

He knew Erica's death still tormented her. Healing would take time.

But he had all the patience in the world.

Watching them, Elvis and the young couple exhaled in relief.

Nydia, moved to tears, suddenly felt warmth envelop her hand.

Jason laced his fingers with hers, his touch tentative.

Her cheeks flushed pink.

They stood there, hearts pounding, hoping this moment would never end.

Later, Isabella turned to Alexander. "Olivia can't stay at Windermere after this. If you both agree, I want her at Skyrim—working at Silverlake Harbor or retiring there. I won't risk her safety in Elmsworth."

Alexander nodded. "I was thinking the same. Skyrim is perfect."

"But she might refuse," Isabella teased. "She adores her godson too much."

Alexander's lips curved. "She won't. Home is where I am—and where you are, Mrs. Kingsley."

"Who's Mrs. Kingsley?" Isabella huffed, turning away.

Alexander chuckled, ruffling her hair.

Elvis, unable to stomach the sweetness, slipped out for a smoke.

Then Alexander's phone rang.

He glanced at the screen, tension flickering in his eyes. "I need to take this."

Isabella watched him leave, her chest tightening.

Outside, Alexander answered. Jareth's voice crackled through. "Everything's set. When do you leave?"

"Tonight. My jet."

"Take mine. Save your fuel!"

"Yours is slower."

"Damn, you're ruthless!" Jareth laughed, then sobered. "Did you tell Isabella?"

"I can't." Alexander's fist clenched. "She'd insist on coming. Country T is too dangerous."

"No one loves their wife like you do."

"No one loves their wife like we do," Alexander corrected, smiling faintly.

Once his enemies were dealt with, he prayed for peace—for Jareth, for his sister, and most of all, for Isabella and himself.

He lingered by the window, smoking, lost in thought.

Then—light footsteps.

A familiar scent.

Isabella pinned him against the wall, her lips inches from his.

Desire flared in Alexander's veins.

But before he could kiss her, she snatched his cigarette, took a drag—and coughed violently.

"Idiot," he chided, pinching her flushed cheek. "You don't smoke."

"It's disgusting!" She stomped the cigarette out. "You and Elvis are human, not chimneys! I'm putting anti-smoking ads on loop at home!"

Alexander tossed the rest of his pack away.

"I'll quit," he vowed, pulling her close. "For you."

Her eyes softened. "Just cut back. I'm not unreasonable."

"No. I'm done." He cupped her face. "But—can I still laze around your place all day?"

Isabella burst out laughing. "What a dumb question!"

Alexander adored her laugh. He'd play the fool forever to hear it.

"When do you leave?" she asked suddenly.

He checked his watch. "Now."

"Need me to see you off?"

"Rest. You've had a long day."

"Alexander."

She rose on her toes, kissing him—soft at first, then deeper.

He groaned, pulling her closer, savoring her.

When they parted, breathless, he smirked. "You're getting better at this."

Isabella punched his chest lightly, then smoothed his tie.

"Come back soon," she whispered. "Or I won't leave the door unlocked."
###Chapter 408

The footage of Isabella and her daughter causing a scene at the funeral spread like wildfire across the internet within hours!

Whether it was Nathaniel pulling strings behind the scenes or the media's collective disgust toward Isabella, the cameras focused solely on Evelyn standing up to her and Erica’s grandmother dumping soup on her. Alexander and Arabella were barely visible, shielded from the spotlight.

Initially, the most explosive revelation was about Arabella being Alexander’s ex-wife.

But with both President Sinclair and Alexander applying pressure, no journalist dared to publish this bombshell, fearing career suicide.

Though rumors of their secret marriage swirled online, the storm surrounding Isabella was so massive that the whispers barely made a ripple.

Netizens turned Isabella’s soup-drenched humiliation into endless memes and savage comments. The Vanderbilt Group’s PR team couldn’t keep up with deleting the posts.

[Long live Isabella! We need her scandals to keep life interesting!]

[Snakes like her, who trample on others’ dignity, belong behind bars for life!]

[The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree! Her daughters are just as rotten!]

[Isabella’s eldest is a spoiled brat, but the younger one’s never been in the spotlight. Maybe she’s the decent one?]

[A viper like Isabella only breeds more vipers!]

Isabella’s reputation was utterly destroyed.

Vanessa, with her own dark past, got dragged back into the limelight thanks to her mother’s theatrics.

But this wasn’t enough. What Arabella and Alexander wanted wasn’t just social annihilation—they wanted total destruction.

After handling business matters and Alexander’s affairs, Daniel was ready to head home to bid farewell to his beloved wife.

Seated in his car, he furiously scrolled through social media comments, using a fake account to obliterate anyone daring to slander Evelyn.

The proud heir of the Fairhaven family, usually arrogant and untouchable, was now cursing like a sailor, waging an online war to defend his fragile wife!

His driver was drenched in sweat, hands steady only from muscle memory as his body trembled.

"Olivia!" Daniel suddenly barked.

The driver paled, stammering, "M-Mr. Fairhaven, you asked Olivia to stay at the villa to care for Mrs. Fairhaven."

"Damn it, I forgot." He rubbed his temples, exhaling sharply.

Currently, everyone around Daniel had been ordered to address Evelyn as "Mrs. Fairhaven."

In truth, he’d also considered transferring half his shares and all his assets to her name.

He’d been mulling it over for a while. The only reason he hadn’t acted yet was because he wanted to wait until the storm passed before formally asking the Sinclair family for Evelyn’s hand.

But first, he had to help Alexander and Arabella crush Isabella—not just out of loyalty, but for his own sake.

Who’d want such a viper for a mother-in-law? It’d be like planting a time bomb in their peaceful lives!

Daniel couldn’t wait any longer and called Olivia directly. "Olivia, monitor the comments. If any media outlet dares to trash my wife, track down the journalist—I’ll personally beat them until their own mother won’t recognize them! For every troll, sue them into oblivion!"

"I’ve already started deleting negative comments about Mrs. Fairhaven. Like you, I won’t let this chaos touch her," Olivia replied, knowing him well after years by his side.

"Good! You’ll get a fat bonus!" Daniel nodded, satisfied.

"But there’s a bigger problem."

Olivia sighed guiltily. "This morning, news of Erica’s funeral reached Mrs. Fairhaven while she was watching TV."

Daniel’s heart clenched—his worst fear realized.

"My fault. I underestimated how fast the news would leak, especially after the blackout. No excuses. Punish me instead of the bonus."

"Not your fault, Olivia. You’ve been juggling Evelyn’s care and my work."

Daniel’s voice was thick with worry. "How is she?"

"Not well. She hasn’t stopped crying. You should come home."

"I’m on my way."

Hanging up, imagining his wife sobbing alone, Daniel’s blood pressure spiked. He kicked the driver’s seat. "Faster! You want your salary or not?!"

"Yes, sir!" The driver floored it, feeling his hemorrhoids protest.

Daniel stormed home, barely shedding his suit before bolting upstairs.

"Mr. Fairhaven." Olivia waited outside the door, bowing.

"Is she inside?" His heart pounded.

"Yes. She hasn’t eaten or drunk anything. Won’t come out."

Olivia bit her lip. "I didn’t dare enter. She needs you right now."

Daniel pushed the door open gently.

Despite daylight, the room was pitch-black, curtains drawn, lights off—oppressively dark.

"Sweetheart? Sweetheart?"

He checked the study, bedroom, closet, bathroom—no sign of her.

Panic set in. His shoulders trembled under his tailored suit, palms slick with sweat.

"Evelyn? Evelyn?!"

His shouts brought Olivia rushing in.

"She’s gone!" Daniel was frantic.

"Impossible! I’ve been guarding the door!"

Olivia’s words struck like lightning. Daniel’s face drained of color, heart hammering.

He yanked open the curtains and window, terrifying images flashing through his mind.

Gritting his teeth, sweat-drenched, he looked down—nothing.

Relief washed over him, his suit soaked through.

Olivia knew his fear. She shared it.

With Evelyn’s fragile mental state, they couldn’t risk her doing something drastic.

"Find her!"

Daniel slammed the windowsill, eyes blazing. "Tear this place apart if you have to!"

"Yes! I’ll search immediately!"

Olivia dashed off.

The room fell silent again. Daniel’s tension eased slightly.

Then—soft sobs.

His heart clenched.

"Evelyn!"

Overjoyed, he followed the sound to the bedroom closet. The sobs grew clearer, each one a knife to his heart.

He opened the closet door—and his breath caught.

Evelyn’s frail body was curled up like a lost kitten, trembling in the dark.

Her arms hugged her knees, sweat-matted bangs clinging to her forehead. Her pale face was flushed from lack of air.

"Daniel."

Seeing him, she burst into tears. "Is Erica really gone?"

Each word shredded his already aching heart.

He scooped her up, her skin burning hot from hiding so long.

Tears welled in his eyes. "I’m sorry, Evelyn. I’m so sorry."

He didn’t know what else to say.

"Is Erica really gone?" She kept asking, relentless.

"She’s just in a better place now," he repeated patiently.

Exhausted, oxygen-deprived, and grief-stricken, she finally passed out.

Daniel called their private doctor. The diagnosis: extreme sorrow and low blood sugar. Rest and IV fluids would help.

Kneeling by the bed, he pressed her hand to his lips, anxiety gnawing at him.

"Mr. Fairhaven, the car’s ready. It’s time to leave."

Olivia hesitated. "If you can’t bear to leave her, don’t. I’ll go to Country T for you. Hunting criminals is dangerous—you have someone to live for now."

"No. I’m going."

Daniel squeezed Evelyn’s hand, resolve hardening. "I promised Alexander. He’s my only brother. Besides, if it weren’t for that bastard who killed Erica, would my wife be like this? When I catch him, he’ll wish he was dead!"

With the Fairhaven family’s methods, the culprit wouldn’t leave Country T alive. But Alexander insisted on bringing him back for Arabella to deal with—making the mission trickier. Daniel had to help.

"Then wear the bulletproof vest I prepared for you and Mr. Sinclair."

"Fine! Olivia, you’re worse than my mom! I picked you because you’re quiet. Why so chatty now?"

Olivia pressed her lips together, stepping back.

Over the years, women had come and gone, but Olivia remained—secretary, bodyguard, confidante, even fake lover when needed.

She was used to being indispensable to Daniel. She’d never had another man.

They weren’t lovers, but sometimes closer than lovers. She didn’t know if it was love—only that it could never be. Especially now that Daniel had found his soulmate.

"Olivia, the next few days will be tough."

After kissing Evelyn’s lips, Daniel stood. "Stay with her 24/7. Move into her room. Lock everything at night. No mistakes."

"Yes, Mr. Fairhaven."

Olivia’s gaze sharpened like a hawk’s. "I’ll protect her with my life. She’ll be safe when you return."

Meanwhile, at Sinclair Holdings, chaos reigned as they scrambled to contain the fallout from Isabella’s scandals.

But in truth, William wasn’t cleaning up after Isabella—he was salvaging the company’s image from another PR disaster!

The higher the tree, the harder the wind blows. Since Alexander took over, his bold reforms had propelled Sinclair Holdings to rapid expansion across Elmsworth and beyond. But such growth bred enemies—competitors watched like vultures.

Now, with a crucial collaboration with a top financial group at stake, any scandal threatening their reputation or stock price could derail everything.

"William! How long will you protect that witch?!"

Outside the chairman’s office, executives flinched at the shouting within.

Inside, the room was a warzone.

Reginald Sinclair, seated in his wheelchair, had hurled everything on the desk at William. A pen holder struck his forehead, swelling instantly, but William stood frozen.

Throwing tantrums seemed to be a Sinclair family tradition.

"Our stocks are in freefall! Have you seen what the media’s saying about us?!"

Reginald’s voice shook with rage. "They’re calling us devils, cutthroats, vipers! The Sinclair name is mud because of that ungrateful woman!"

William clenched his fists, fury boiling inside. He’d warned Isabella repeatedly to lay low, but she’d ignored him, pushing her luck until it ran out.

She’d grown bold because he’d spoiled her. Now he regretted it—but wouldn’t admit his mistake to his father.

"Isabella’s confined to Windermere Estate, reflecting on her actions. She won’t leave without my permission."

William took a deep breath. "Father, I believe she went to the funeral to salvage our reputation. If things had gone as planned, there’d be no issue. This mess is partly your precious granddaughter-in-law’s fault—Ms. Sinclair!"
###Chapter 409

The mention of Seraphina sent a shadow creeping over Harrison's expression, his features darkening like an approaching tempest.

"What did you just say? Explain yourself."

"Seraphina and Arabella have always been like fire and ice—everyone knew that long before her divorce from Nathaniel. Think about it. Every time she appeared, chaos followed for the Sinclair Group. This time is no exception. Even if she disregards Arabella's feelings, she should at least respect the Sinclair family name!"

Sebastian had meant to downplay his own misjudgment, but the more he spoke, the more his bitterness toward Seraphina bled through. He was so convincing, he almost believed his own words. "The funeral was a sacred occasion. Why did she have to cause a scene then? Couldn't she wait? Her actions prove she's deliberately targeting the Sinclair Group. This mess is entirely her fault—her reckless behavior and relentless attacks on our family!"

"So you're blaming Seraphina for everything?" Harrison's piercing gaze narrowed.

"At the very least, she bears undeniable responsibility," Sebastian replied coolly, a master of deflection.

"Shut your damn mouth!"

Harrison's rage erupted. He snatched the phone from his desk and hurled it at Sebastian.

This time, Sebastian dodged. Had he not, his skull would've been cracked open like an egg.

"When a servant of the Sinclair family died, you and Arabella, as the masters of Windsor Estates, showed no regard for human life! Seraphina and her family were the ones who arranged that poor girl's funeral, giving her the dignity she deserved. You did nothing but let your reckless wife run wild. And now you're blaming Seraphina? A woman in her twenties? Have you no shame left?"

Harrison's voice trembled with fury when it came to his beloved granddaughter. His bloodshot eyes burned, his parched lips quivering. "Sebastian, when did you become so heartless? Or were you always like this, and I was just blind to it?"

Sebastian froze.

The fury in his father's eyes sent a chill down his spine. His temples throbbed. "You never truly accepted me, did you? Back then, compared to Felix, you'd have rather seen me in prison, wouldn't you?"

Harrison's pupils contracted. His grip on the wheelchair's armrest tightened. "You and your brother are both my sons. I've never favored one over the other. It's your own insecurity that made you feel neglected! But now? Now I regret not throwing you in jail to teach you a lesson! I regret not stopping you from marrying that viper Arabella! I regret failing to protect Nathaniel and his mother, leaving him motherless so young. You lost a woman who truly loved you!"

"Loved me? What did you say?" Sebastian's face paled, his voice shaking.

Harrison thought of Nathaniel's mother—Evelyn Lockwood. A pang of grief twisted his heart. "Evelyn only ever loved you. Her feelings never wavered, and she never looked at another man. I used to wonder where Nathaniel got his romantic nature. I thought it was from me, but no—it was from his mother."

"That's impossible," Sebastian muttered, his eyes clouded with confusion. "If she loved me, why refuse to marry me? Why push me away? She wouldn't even let me touch her."

"Because she was suffering—physically and mentally. She was drowning in depression, in constant pain. Every morning, her first thought was ending her life. Only thoughts of Nathaniel kept her going."

Sebastian staggered back, a sharp pain lancing through his chest.

He'd known about Evelyn's depression, but back then, mental illness was poorly understood. Her silence and seclusion seemed like mere quirks. Between his CEO duties, he'd overlooked the severity of her condition.

Harrison's eyes glistened with sorrow. "I thought she was distancing herself to manipulate you or because she'd fallen for someone else. But one day, while you were away on business, Evelyn came to me and confessed everything."

"Mr. Sinclair, I'm here to ask a favor."

Harrison remembered Evelyn—still breathtakingly beautiful, standing before him with no makeup, dressed simply. No wonder his son had been so captivated.

"I want your permission to leave Sebastian. To leave the Sinclair family."

"You want to leave? What about Nathaniel? Will you take him?" Harrison had nearly risen from his seat.

Evelyn shook her head.

"That's why I'm here. I intend to leave alone—taking nothing, not even Nate. He's my son, but he's also Sebastian's, your grandson. I've seen how much you love him. Knowing he has you will comfort me, no matter where I am. Besides... my health is failing. A mother like me would only torment him. In time, he'd grow to resent me. I won't let that happen."

Harrison had seen it then—Evelyn's quiet intelligence. The Sinclair name could offer Nathaniel opportunities she never could. Staying with the family meant the best education, the finest life, a future among the elite.

Every parent wants the best for their child.

"One question, Evelyn. Why leave now?"

Despite his relief she wouldn't take Nathaniel, curiosity gnawed at him. "Sebastian adores you. He'd move heaven and earth to make you happy. He wants to marry you. As his wife, you'd be a Sinclair. You've given him a son who could inherit the Sinclair Group. With all that within reach, you'd walk away? Or... is there someone else? Were you ever truly in love with my son?"

Harrison had immediately regretted the bluntness, but Evelyn showed no offense. She answered calmly.

"No, Mr. Sinclair. I love Sebastian. Truly. But in my current state, I'm unfit to be his wife or the lady of this house. I don't know how long I have left. The woman at his side should be strong, capable—someone who can care for him, their children, and support his career. I can't do any of that. I won't be his burden. Leaving now... it's kinder this way."

Tears welled in Harrison's eyes as he recounted this.

Sebastian stood frozen, his heart hammering against his ribs like a trapped bird.

"No... that can't be," he whispered, lips trembling, his cheek twitching.

Seeing his son's devastation, Harrison was reminded of Nathaniel. In many ways, his grandson surpassed his father—except in one fatal flaw: both were stubborn to the point of self-destruction, refusing to admit mistakes until it was too late.

"Evelyn made me swear to keep this secret. She wanted to vanish quietly, leaving no traces for you or Nathaniel to mourn."

Harrison shook his head bitterly. "I was a fool. I only cared about keeping Nathaniel in the family. I never anticipated Arabella. I never dreamed you'd replace Evelyn with such a monster. My greatest regret."

"If Evelyn hadn't been so cold, if she hadn't despised me, I'd never have married Arabella."

Even now, Evelyn held a place in Sebastian's heart Arabella could never touch. But pride was his poison. He'd never admit his mistakes, never yield. The golden boy who'd always gotten everything he wanted couldn't bear Evelyn's indifference—her refusal to love him. That was how Arabella slithered into their lives, how that venomous woman took over their home.

"Lawrence, bring out Evelyn's belongings."

"Yes, Mr. Sinclair."

Lawrence produced a wooden box from his briefcase, handing it to Sebastian. "Sir, these are the late Mrs. Sinclair's personal effects. She left them with Mr. Harrison before departing. She said discarding them would be a waste, but keeping them brought only pain. These tokens—the rings you gave her, the mementos of your love—should be returned to you."

Sebastian stared at the box, hands shaking but unable to take it.

"Let the past stay buried, Sebastian. You've replaced the old with the new. No need to cling to relics."

Harrison's gaze darkened. "But now, I think you should have them. Otherwise, you'll never see who you truly loved. Never realize how blind you've been."

Sebastian accepted the box, his throat too tight to speak.

As he left the office, Harrison slumped against the door, drained.

"Sir," Lawrence ventured gently, "Evelyn wanted those items destroyed. Why did you keep them?"

"Because I was waiting," Harrison murmured. "Waiting for him to see Arabella for what she is."

"But judging by his reaction, he's still defending her. It seems he hasn't truly awakened."

Harrison snorted. "No, he's defending his pride. If I don't understand my own son, who does? He's on the brink of abandoning Arabella. Right now, rekindling old love might be the final push. The dead often wound deeper than the living. This will make him see. Make him regret."

The luxury car sped toward Windsor Estates.

Sebastian clutched the wooden box the entire ride, only daring to open it after an eternity.

The box had two layers. The first held velvet pouches. Each one he opened sent fresh agony through his chest.

The diamond engagement ring seemed modest now, but thirty years ago, it would've made any woman swoon. The jade bracelet was a birthday gift he'd painstakingly selected.

Back then, he'd remembered every anniversary, every lovers' holiday. Now, he couldn't even recall the day Evelyn died.

Sebastian took a shuddering breath and opened the second layer—a stack of aged photographs.

Hands trembling, he flipped through them. His vision blurred with tears, a deafening roar in his ears.

He remembered. Evelyn always carried a camera, wandering Windsor Estates, capturing moments.

He'd never known what she photographed. Now he saw—every picture had one subject: him.

On each photo's back were her confessions—restrained, tender, overflowing with love.

"Dawn's light, dusk's clouds—walking or sitting, all I see is you."

"I don't know when it happened, but I've become someone who can't live without you. Perhaps this is what the Bible means—woman made from man's rib."

"Sebastian, I hope my humble origins, my regrettable past, my clumsy love haven't burdened you. I know my feelings are but a drop in your brilliant life. But Sebastian, it's all I have to give. I love you so."

Sebastian crumpled a photo, silent tears soaking the delicate handwriting.

"Why didn't you ever tell me?" His voice broke. "Evelyn... do you know I've always loved you?"
###Chapter 410

The moment the restriction was imposed, Isabella Sinclair erupted in fury within the confines of Windermere Estate. Her curses echoed through the halls, venom dripping from every word.

"I'm sorry, Mrs. Sinclair, but these are Mr. Sinclair's orders. We must comply."

Nathaniel Whitmore, Alexander Kingsley's secretary, regarded her with icy detachment, his tone laced with thinly veiled disdain. "I suggest you return to your quarters and spare us all the unnecessary drama. The Sinclair Group is already in turmoil because of you. The least you can do is not add to Mr. Kingsley's burdens."

"How dare you!"

With a sharp crack, Isabella's palm connected with Nathaniel's cheek, her eyes blazing with fury. "I am Alexander Kingsley's wife! You're nothing but a glorified servant. Who gave you the right to speak to me like that?!"

Nathaniel chuckled, unfazed. "Indeed, Mr. Kingsley has always treated me well. But tell me, Mrs. Sinclair, aren't you the one exploiting his power, flouting rules, and abusing those beneath you?"

Isabella froze, the implication of his words sinking in. The audacity—comparing her to a servant?!

Just as she raised her hand to strike again, Alexander strode into the room, his expression unreadable.

"Alexander!" Instantly, her demeanor shifted. Tears welled in her eyes as she flung herself into his arms. "You're finally back. I can't bear being without you."

The transformation was instantaneous—the shrewish rage replaced by trembling vulnerability.

Nathaniel scoffed, his contempt undisguised.

"You seemed perfectly capable of handling yourself in my absence—even disciplining my secretary," Alexander remarked coolly, his lips curling into a humorless smile. His gaze was glacial, sending a shiver down her spine.

"Alexander, I saw the rumors about me from the funeral have been suppressed online. You did that for me, didn't you?" Isabella sniffled, pressing closer. "I knew you wouldn't abandon me in my time of need."

Alexander stepped back abruptly, leaving her grasping at air.

Her eyes widened in shock as she met his icy stare.

"Who said I did it for you?" His voice was laced with derision. "I did it for the Sinclair family. For the Sinclair Group."

"Alexander..." Her voice faltered, disbelief etching across her face.

"I may be your husband, but my primary duty is as the CEO of the Sinclair Group—not as your personal cleanup crew."

He turned away, unable to stomach the sight of her. "This is the last time. Next time, I'll let the world tear you apart. If you become a pariah, it won't be my concern. Clean up your own messes. No one owes you that."

He moved to leave, but Isabella seized his arm. "Alexander! How can you say that? I'm your wife! Your family! How could you throw me to the wolves?!"

"Wife?" He laughed bitterly, prying her fingers off one by one. "Don't insult the word. The Sinclair family has no room for someone as reckless and destructive as you. I can no longer recognize you as my wife."

"Alexander! Are you divorcing me?!" Her voice rose to a shriek.

"Do you think I don't want to?!"

His patience snapped, fury erupting like a volcano. "If it weren't for the Sinclair Group's current crisis, if it weren't for the two daughters you bore me, do you honestly think I'd keep you around?!"

Isabella paled, her blood running cold.

She had always believed her position was secure—that her daughters and the company's reputation would shield her. But hearing the word "divorce" from his lips nearly shattered her.

She had truly lost him.

No—without her status as Mrs. Kingsley, she was nothing. Who would protect her then?

It was only Alexander's name that had kept Sebastian Lockwood and Evadne at bay. Without it, they would destroy her.

"From this moment on, you are forbidden from leaving Windermere Estate without my permission. If you disobey, I'll send you abroad. You'll never set foot in Elmsworth again."

"You're being unreasonable, Alexander! I went to that funeral with good intentions—to help settle matters! It was that viper Evadne who provoked me, trying to ruin the Sinclair Group! She's the one to blame!"

"Do you take me for a fool?!"

Alexander's voice was steel. "I checked. Those reporters were yours. You knew exactly what you were doing, provoking Evadne deliberately. If you choose to play the fool, don't blame others for treating you like one. Stay out of my sight!"

"Alexander! You can't do this to me!"

In their struggle, a wooden box slipped from Alexander's grip, crashing to the floor. Its contents scattered—photographs, trinkets, a jade bracelet now split in two.

His breath hitched, rage boiling in his veins as he stared at the remnants of Seraphina Lockwood's belongings.

Isabella recoiled, her face draining of color.

She recognized them—Seraphina's things.

Why did he still keep them? Why cling to the mementos of a woman dead for over two decades?

"Get out. Now."

Alexander dropped to his knees, gathering each item with trembling hands, his grief palpable.

"Alexander, I didn't mean—"

"OUT!"

His roar shook the room, raw and unbridled.

Late that night, the study was silent, bathed in silver moonlight that cast shadows over Alexander's haggard face.

Nathaniel entered with a glass of water and his blood pressure medication.

"Mr. Kingsley, it's late. You should rest."

"You've had a long night," Alexander murmured, his gaze fixed on Seraphina's photographs.

Nathaniel paused, understanding the unspoken reference to Isabella. "I've been with you for years. This is nothing. But... if Seraphina were here, she wouldn't want you tormenting yourself like this."

"Yes. Seraphina was always kind." His voice cracked, eyes red-rimmed.

"Are you planning to file for divorce?" Nathaniel ventured cautiously.

Alexander exhaled, shoulders sagging. "Not yet. The Sinclair Group can't afford more instability. And with my youngest daughter's condition... if I divorce Isabella, I'd have to send her abroad. I fear the separation would worsen Mari's health."

Nathaniel nodded in understanding.

"Have you located Sebastian?" Alexander asked abruptly.

"Apologies, Mr. Kingsley. You know how elusive he is. If he doesn't want to be found, he won't be."

Alexander said nothing, pulling out his phone to call Sebastian directly.

After several attempts, the line finally connected.

"What is it? It's late."

"Sebastian."

"If this is about the project meeting, save your breath. I'm not attending." The icy detachment in his son's voice stung.

Alexander clenched his jaw. "Sebastian, do you have time tomorrow? To visit your mother with me."

Silence.

Then a bitter laugh. "Are you joking?"

"I'm serious."

Alexander's voice was thick with shame. "I know I've failed her. All these years, I haven't visited her grave. I haven't been the husband I should have been."

"Failed?" Sebastian's voice was venomous. "You think that word covers twenty-three years of neglect? The pain you caused her? You have no right to stand before her grave. She has me. She doesn't need your belated remorse."

"I was her husband! The man she loved most!" Alexander's pride flared, childish in its desperation.

"Even if she did love you once," Sebastian hissed, "the moment she jumped from Windermere's balcony, that love ended. Sometimes, I think her death was a mercy. At least she didn't have to endure your betrayals, watching you share a bed with other women while playing the dutiful wife. That agony was worse than death. Her love for you was her greatest suffering."

The image of Seraphina's broken body flashed before Alexander's eyes.

His breath seized, the phone nearly slipping from his grasp. Nathaniel watched, uneasy but silent.

"I don't know what prompted this sudden guilt, but hear this: you will never have the right to face her. Not now. Not ever."

The line went dead.

Alexander slumped, sweat beading on his brow, his strength sapped.

"Mr. Kingsley? Are you alright?"

"Water. Please."

As Nathaniel left, Alexander collapsed onto the couch, guilt and grief crashing over him like a tidal wave.

Memories and voices swirled in his mind—

"I don't know when it started, but I can't live without you."

"Every morning, she thought of ending her life—but she stayed for Sebastian."

"The moment she jumped, her love for you died."

Suddenly, his eyes snapped open, heart pounding.

Nathaniel returned with the water.

"Nathaniel... how much do you remember about Seraphina's death?"

Nathaniel hesitated. "I have an excellent memory. That's why you chose me, isn't it? Ask what you need."

"Back then, Seraphina was diagnosed with depression. You cared for her. How severe was it?"

"The doctors called it severe, but under Sebastian's care, she improved."

"Then why?" Alexander's voice broke. "A woman who loved me, adored her son, just wanted to leave quietly—why would she suddenly kill herself?"

Nathaniel exhaled slowly. "Mr. Kingsley... I've waited twenty years to ask this. Did you ever suspect—even for a moment—that Seraphina was murdered?"

The question hung in the air, ringing in Alexander's ears.

Meanwhile, in a luxury suite in Country T, Sebastian stood by the window, fists clenched, his rage a living thing.

He had nearly revealed the truth—that Isabella had killed his mother. But he held back.

Not yet.

He wanted Alexander to realize the monster he'd cherished for twenty years in the most brutal way possible. To shatter his pride. To watch the world laugh at his folly.

Lucas Grant offered him a cigarette.

"Take one. Calm down."

Sebastian snapped it in half.

"I quit."

"What? Since when?"

"Since Evadne asked me to."

At the mention of her name, the ice in his eyes thawed, a faint smile touching his lips.
###Chapter 411

Jareth froze, his jaw slack. It took him several seconds to snap it shut.

"Thad, have you ever noticed you're a total masochist?" He shook his head in disbelief. "You're practically begging to be whipped. At this rate, you'll be handing over your entire wallet, and I'll be stuck paying for every damn outing."

"Haven't you been footing the bill all along anyway?" Thaddeus replied without missing a beat.

True enough. Thad was a homebody—work, gym, boxing, repeat. Jareth couldn't recall a single time Thad had initiated plans. It was always him dragging Thad out, driving to the Abernathy estate to pry him loose. But Jareth didn't mind. Not one bit.

Losing his father young had taught him the value of love. Thaddeus? The guy had everything and nothing all at once.

So Jareth made it his mission to inject some joy into Thad's life. Even if it was fleeting, even if it was just stupid outings—anything to keep the shadows at bay.

"Jareth, I like it when Evadne bosses me around."

Thaddeus' lips curled into a soft smile, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "It means she cares. I'd let her handcuff me to her 24/7 if she wanted. For Evadne, I'd surrender my freedom in a heartbeat."

"Jesus, man, you sound like a total freak!" Jareth shuddered, rubbing his arms as goosebumps erupted.

"You're too rebellious to understand." Thaddeus smirked, nudging him. "Lucky for you, Mari's gentle. She'd never dream of ordering you around. Who else would put up with your nonsense?"

"Hey! I've got women lining up like crops in a field—endless options!" Jareth huffed.

"Oh? Should I be congratulating you?" Thaddeus' gaze turned icy.

Jareth gulped, backtracking instantly. "No, no, I didn't mean—"

"Let me make this clear," Thaddeus cut in, voice low. "If you ever hurt Mari, Evadne and I will end you."

Jareth threw up his hands. "I swear on my life! Mari's it for me. Only her. Forever. Or may lightning strike me, the Fairhaven Group crumble, and I die penniless in a ditch!"

Silence.

"...I'll even get a vasectomy!" Jareth blurted.

Thaddeus finally cracked. "Fine. I'll ask Evadne. She knows some good doctors."

Jareth's face fell. He looked ready to cry while Thaddeus fought a smirk.

The mood shifted as Thaddeus' expression darkened again. Jareth hesitated before asking, "What's with your dad suddenly wanting to see Cynthia?"

"No idea. Some midlife crisis, probably." Thaddeus' jaw clenched. "Twenty years of pretending she never existed, and now this? Half-assed remorse is worse than indifference."

Jareth lit a cigarette, exhaling slowly. "You're ten times the man he is, but... well. Like father, like son."

Thaddeus' face went stormy. Trust Jareth to twist the knife.

"I know I messed up. I failed Evadne once. Now? I'd give her everything. Even my life." Thaddeus rubbed his temples, his mother's suicide flashing behind his eyelids. "Frederic? He's selfish to the core. He never loved my mom. He doesn't deserve forgiveness. Neither do I."

Jareth sighed, heart aching for his friend. Then his phone rang, shattering the heavy air.

"Report," Jareth barked, putting it on speaker.

"Mr. Fairhaven—bad news!" The agent's voice was frantic. "Just as Mr. Abernathy suspected, Ward's got a whole damn cartel waiting in Country T! These guys are connected—government, business, you name it. Drugs, arms, murder—they're untouchable!"

Thaddeus and Jareth exchanged grim looks.

They'd expected trouble. Not a full-blown warzone.

"Where is that bastard now? Don't tell me you lost him!" Jareth growled.

"Our teams tailed him to Star Island. He boarded a yacht. We engaged, but—" The agent swallowed hard. "His reinforcements came out of nowhere. Heavy artillery. Two of our men... didn't make it."

Jareth's fists clenched, veins bulging. These were his best men. His family.

"You're certain it's Star Island?" Thaddeus' voice was arctic.

"Positive. We scoped it after retreating. His yacht's docked there—no other landmass for miles. He's there."

"Good work. Leave the rest to me." Thaddeus' tone softened. "You'll be compensated."

"You're going in alone? Those guys are animals!" the agent protested.

"They're ex-mercs. You're outgunned."

"Thad, no!" Jareth grabbed his arm. "You die, and Evadne? Mari? They'll never forgive me!"

"I survived Zenithia's warzone. I'll survive this." Thaddeus smiled faintly. "Evadne's waiting. And my mom... she's watching."

Elspeth's real prison wasn't house arrest. It was withdrawal.

Two days without Victor's injections, and she was unraveling. Every escape attempt had failed. Frederic had turned Windermere into her gilded cage.

"Mom?" Glynnis knocked, tray in hand. "You need to eat."

Silence.

The unlocked door made her blood boil. The Abernathy staff were already writing Elspeth off.

Inside, the room was pitch black. Then—a moan.

Glynnis dropped the tray. Elspeth writhed on the bed, limbs rigid, face ghostly pale.

"I can't—I can't take it," Elspeth whimpered, clawing at her own skin.

"Mom?!" Glynnis backed against the wall, terrified.

"Find Victor. Now." Elspeth crawled to her, eyes wild. "I need my medicine!"

"You're an addict! That poison is killing you!"

"GET IT FOR ME!" Elspeth shrieked, yanking Glynnis' skirt. "If I fall, you fall! Frederic will discard you like trash! Mari has Jareth—what do you have? Only me!"

Glynnis paled. The truth hit like a slap.

She fled into the night, speeding toward the hospital. Rage burned through her. Why did Mari get everything? Why?!

Victor was packing when his phone lit up. Evadne's name made him smile.

"Ms. Ashbourne."

"Still in Elmsworth?"

"Yes, but—"

"Stay. Glynnis is coming." Evadne's voice was silk over steel. "Elspeth's desperate. Give her all the drugs she wants."

Victor paused. "Wouldn't cutting her off hurt her more?"

"Victor," Evadne chuckled, stroking Thaddeus' robe, "I'm no philanthropist. Let her drown in it. The deeper she sinks, the harder she falls."

The brilliance of it struck him. Clean Elspeth up now, and she might slip away. Keep feeding her addiction? That was a noose tightening.

As Evadne hung up, headlights pierced the hospital windows. Glynnis had arrived.
###Chapter 412

Seraphina Sinclair gripped the steering wheel of her Porsche, knuckles turning white as she gathered her resolve. After what felt like an eternity, she finally stepped out into the sterile hospital parking lot. She'd come alone—this was a matter too delicate for witnesses. The fewer people involved, the safer it would be.

The hospital doors swung open with an eerie creak before she even touched them. The empty lobby seemed to swallow her whole, the fluorescent lights humming like a warning.

Her phone vibrated violently in her clutch. The caller ID made her stomach drop—Dr. Nathaniel Whitmore's number flashed on screen, freshly saved from their last disastrous encounter.

"Hello?" Seraphina forced steadiness into her voice while her eyes darted across the vacant reception area.

"Miss Sinclair, I'm in my second-floor office. Don't keep me waiting." The line went dead before she could respond.

Jaw clenched, Seraphina took the stairs two at a time. The office door gave way under her trembling push.

There he sat—Dr. Whitmore lounging on his leather couch in that pristine white coat, that infuriating smirk playing on his lips. Now she understood why her mother was so obsessed with this man. With his chiseled jawline and predatory grace, he was every bit the silver fox the society pages claimed.

"Punctual. I'm impressed." He swirled a glass of amber liquid, the ice clinking like a taunt. "Most heiresses make me wait hours."

"Cut the crap, Nathaniel." Seraphina's manicured nails dug into her palms. "You know exactly why I'm here."

"How is Arabella these days?" He ignored her question, lips curling around her mother's name like a private joke. "I do miss our... sessions."

"Shut your filthy mouth!" Seraphina's cheeks burned with equal parts rage and shame. "My mother is a Sinclair—she's not some cheap fling for you to—"

"Who said I pursued her?" Nathaniel's laugh was all teeth. "Your precious mommy came crawling to me. Begged for it, actually."

The room spun. Seraphina stumbled back, bile rising in her throat. "Just give me the damn pills!"

"Tsk tsk." He produced a stainless steel case from his desk, dangling it just out of reach. "No 'please'? No groveling? Rich girls really are spoiled."

Seraphina lunged—only to grasp air as he yanked the case away.

"You think this is a game?!" she shrieked.

"Everything's a game, princess." Nathaniel's gaze raked over her body like a physical touch. "And right now, you're losing."

The unspoken demand hung between them. Seraphina's breath hitched—she knew that look. Men had been giving it to her since she turned sixteen.

Her fingers moved to the first pearl button of her Chanel dress. "If this is what you want..."

One by one, the buttons gave way until the dress pooled at her feet. The hospital air prickled against her exposed skin, her La Perla lingerie suddenly feeling obscene.

Nathaniel's laughter cracked like a whip. "Christ, is sex all you rich bitches think about? When did I say I wanted to fuck you?"

Humiliation burned through her veins. She scrambled for her dress, but his next words froze her mid-reach.

"Kneel." He pointed to the floor. "Beg properly, and maybe I'll consider it."

"You sick—"

"That sweet mother of yours?" Nathaniel checked his Rolex. "How long until withdrawal kicks in? Two hours? Three?"

Seraphina's knees hit the linoleum with a crack that echoed through the empty hospital.

Meanwhile, fifteen miles away, Isabella Kingsley watched the live feed from her penthouse study, cucumber slices sliding off her face as the scene unfolded.

"Damn it, Nathaniel," she muttered as Seraphina's bare knees met the floor. The security monitor showed every humiliating angle in crisp 4K. "I told you not to improvise."

Her phone buzzed—a text from her brother Christian: Package secured. Moving to phase two.

Isabella's fingers flew across the keyboard: Stay sharp. The viper's nest is waking up.

She didn't need cameras to know what came next. Seraphina would storm out, make a scene, then call her private security team. Exactly on cue, the monitor showed the heiress stumbling to her car, face contorted in rage.

Nathaniel whistled as he drove home, the medicine case safely stowed in his glove compartment. He'd just rounded the corner near his brownstone when headlights blinded him.

The impact came from nowhere—a black Escalade T-boning his Audi with bone-jarring force. Glass exploded as his car spun three times before slamming into a lamppost.

Hands dragged him through the shattered window. Pain exploded across his ribs as steel-toed boots connected with his kidneys.

"Boss says make it hurt," growled a voice above him. Cold metal pressed against his kneecap—a hunting knife catching moonlight.

Nathaniel braced for the slice when a gunshot rang out. His attacker screamed, collapsing like a marionette with cut strings.

Three more shots. Three more thuds.

Through bloodied vision, Nathaniel saw a shadow move with lethal precision—a masked figure dispatching the thugs with terrifying efficiency. The last attacker ran; the figure threw the knife. It found its mark between the man's shoulder blades.

The rescuer hauled Nathaniel into a waiting Maybach. The interior smelled like jasmine and gunpowder.

"Isabella?" Nathaniel coughed, tasting copper. "How—"

"Did you really think I'd let you walk into that viper's nest unprotected?" Isabella Kingsley tossed a medkit onto his lap, her emerald eyes flashing. "What part of 'follow the script' confused you, doctor?"

Nathaniel winced as she dabbed at his forehead wound. "I just wanted to—"

"To what? Humiliate Seraphina for fun?" Isabella's grip tightened on the antiseptic wipe. "That girl may be dumb as a post, but she's got her mother's vicious streak. You're lucky Christian was tailing you."

Outside the car, Christian Ashbourne removed his ski mask, revealing boyish features that belied his lethal skills. "Next time you feel like playing games, doc? Give us a heads-up."

Isabella's phone pinged. She paled reading the message. "They're in Country T already. Both of them."

Christian swore. "Your ex is either the bravest or dumbest bastard alive."

"Or both." Isabella's nails bit into her palms. "If Thaddeus thinks he can waltz into Ward's territory with just Jareth as backup..."

Nathaniel watched something dangerous flicker across her face—something between fury and fear.

"Call Cassius," she ordered Christian. "Tell him to mobilize every contact he has in Country T. And Christian?"

Her brother paused at the door.

"Bring me the black suitcase from the vault."

The men exchanged glances. That case only came out for war.

Isabella's smile didn't reach her eyes. "If Thaddeus wants to play hero? Let's make sure he lives long enough to regret it."
###Chapter 413

The next morning, Alexander and Lucas set off discreetly toward Star Island with their elite team.

The weather had been perfect when they departed, but within two hours of their voyage, the skies darkened violently. A sudden tempest unleashed its fury upon them.

For stealth and speed, they'd chosen sleek yachts over bulky vessels. The smaller crafts were harder to detect and could scatter if ambushed. But now, the storm revealed their fatal flaw.

"Mr. Kingsley! Mr. Grant!" A crew member shouted over the roaring winds, struggling with the helm. "The waves are too strong! We can't maintain course!"

A monstrous wall of water surged toward Lucas. His eyes widened in shock.

Then—Alexander moved.

He threw himself before Lucas, taking the full brunt of the crashing wave. The force would have shattered bones, but Alexander stood unwavering, a fortress against the storm.

"Alex! Are you hurt?" Lucas grabbed his arm, pulse racing.

Alexander's lips curved slightly, seawater glistening on his lashes. "Just a splash."

Their gazes locked. Lucas felt heat creep up his neck. "Damn it, stop looking at me like that. I might actually fall for you."

"Thank Isabella. Without her, I'd worry you'd develop real feelings." Alexander smirked before striding to take control of the wheel.

"Who said I was serious?" Lucas scoffed, wiping saltwater from his face. He studied Alexander's broad shoulders—the unshakable confidence that had saved them countless times. A pang of admiration struck him.

Years ago, he'd foolishly pursued Evelyn Ashbourne. When she rejected him, it had crushed his pride. Now, seeing how Alexander cherished her, Lucas understood. Evelyn had chosen right. And he? He'd found his own happiness with Isabella.

The sea raged on, but under Alexander's command, their yacht cut through the chaos. Two brutal hours later, they reached Star Island first. The remaining vessels arrived within thirty minutes.

Night had fallen, the storm finally relenting.

"Perfect cover for our operation." Lucas holstered twin pistols, eyes gleaming with adrenaline.

Alexander adjusted his tactical vest, muscles flexing. "This isn't a game. One mistake, and it's over."

"You've changed. You have Evelyn now. You're not some reckless lone wolf anymore."

Lucas stiffened. Isabella's tear-streaked face after Erica's death flashed in his mind. If he fell here... His once unbreakable heart now had fragile cracks.

"Mr. Kingsley! Mr. Grant!" A shout interrupted them. "Helicopter approaching!"

The team raised weapons, but Alexander remained calm. "Hold fire. If they were enemies, we'd already be under attack."

The chopper landed, kicking up sand. Through the haze, a tall figure emerged.

Alexander's breath caught.

"Holy hell—it's your brother-in-law!" Lucas ducked behind Alexander like a startled cat.

Cassius Ashbourne approached, his presence alone enough to make hardened men falter. The two alpha males locked eyes, tension crackling between them.

"President Ashbourne." Alexander's voice was steel. "What brings you here?"

"Same purpose as you. Need I explain?"

Their history hung heavy—Alexander's past abandonment of Evelyn, her three-year wait, her near-fatal injury saving him. Cassius would never forgive easily.

"I'll handle Ward. Your involvement isn't necessary."

Cassius's smile was razor-thin. "Evelyn is my sister. This is Ashbourne business."

"Lucas. We're leaving." Alexander turned sharply.

"Didn't you tell my sister this was a business trip, Mr. Kingsley?" Cassius's words struck like a blade.

Alexander whirled back, panic flashing across his features. "Don't tell her. If she learns I'm hunting Ward, she'll charge into danger. I can't—won't—let that happen. But if I don't protect what's hers, what kind of man am I?"

His raw emotion silenced the beach.

Cassius studied him. The man who'd once broken his sister's heart now stood ready to break himself for her.

"Fine. But we work together."

Meanwhile, chaos brewed at Kingsley Corp.

The crucial meeting with Aether Dynamics had begun without Alexander. Frederic sat stone-faced as whispers spread:

"Where's Mr. Kingsley? He's never missed a meeting!"

"Not since he started chasing that Ashbourne girl. Probably too busy playing lovebird."

Frederic's fist clenched. Then his phone vibrated—Chad calling. He silenced it.

The video conference connected. Onscreen appeared William Morris, his son... and Chad, laughing with them like old friends.

Gasps filled the room. "Dad?!" Chad waved casually.

William smiled. "Mr. Kingsley, shall we discuss terms?"

The deal was struck shockingly fast. Too fast.

When Hamilton received the news, his eyes darkened. "Chad signed it? Not Frederic?"

Mr. Murray nodded gravely. "Chad's connections with the Morris family run deeper than we knew."

"And Alexander?"

"Abroad. For Ms. Ashbourne."

Hamilton sighed. His grandson's weakness for Evelyn would be his undoing.

"Murray... there can't be two kings on one throne."
###Chapter 414

The moment Alexander finalized the contract, a heavy weight lifted from his shoulders. He exhaled deeply, relief washing over him.

This major deal had revitalized the company's reputation, restoring some of its lost prestige.

Back in his office, Alexander couldn't wait to call Nathaniel.

"Dad, congratulations. You've secured another significant partnership."

Nathaniel was already in the car, heading home. His soft brown eyes held warmth, and a faint smile curved his lips.

In terms of appearance, Nathaniel wasn't as striking as Sebastian, nor as sharp as Dominic. He lacked the delicate beauty of Evelyn.

Yet his relaxed, refined features carried a unique charm—approachable, inviting.

Despite his chronic illness confining him to a wheelchair, Nathaniel never wallowed in self-pity. His smile remained bright, his gaze steady—as if that traumatic kidnapping had never happened.

"Nathaniel, this partnership was all thanks to you. I should be thanking you." Alexander's voice brimmed with admiration.

"Dad, it's nothing. No need for formalities between us."

Nathaniel's lips quirked slightly. "Everything I do is for the Kingsley family—for Kingsley Group. It's my duty as a Kingsley."

Alexander was deeply moved. "How are you feeling, son? Any improvement from a few years ago?"

"I'm fine, Dad. Don't worry about me."

"I'll check my schedule soon. Let's arrange a family reunion."

Nathaniel chuckled. "No rush. We might meet in Elmworth sooner than you think."

"You're coming back?" Alexander's breath caught.

"Yes. Home is where the heart is. No matter how long I stay abroad, it's not home. I miss my family." His voice softened. "And Sebastian... I haven't seen him in years. I want to know how he's been."

Star Island wasn't large, but its dense forests and treacherous terrain made it perilous. As night fell, the jungle grew eerier, concealing unpredictable dangers.

After deliberation, Sebastian and Dominic decided to leave Harrison outside as backup.

"Damn it! Why? I'm itching for action!" Harrison kicked the dirt in frustration. "I might not be as skilled as you two, but I'm a sharpshooter! I never miss!"

Dominic, who usually found Harrison amusing, now thought him utterly foolish.

"You still want to marry Evelyn?" Sebastian asked flatly.

"More than anything!"

"Then stay here and behave."

"After twenty years of friendship, you're blackmailing me?" Harrison gritted his teeth. "Fine! Fine! But signal me if you need help, or we're done."

Sebastian had him right where he wanted.

"Be careful out there."

With a nod, Sebastian and Dominic vanished into the forest.

Come back safely with your brother, Harrison silently prayed.

At The Velvet Haven in Elmworth, Evelyn was toasting with Colonel Eden of Country T.

Their partnership had been mutually beneficial—Eden profited handsomely, while Evelyn gained influence in Helgen and Country T.

Now a tycoon in Helgen, Evelyn remained discreet about their dealings.

Elsie Archer played the charming hostess, her low-cut dress drawing Eden's hungry gaze.

The door opened. Harvey rushed to Evelyn's side. "Mr. Chambers, Sebastian and Harrison have arrived in Country T. They're heading into Star Island—likely to capture Ward tonight."

Evelyn sipped his wine. "Just the two of them?"

"And Dominic Ashbourne."

Harvey hesitated. "Should we proceed? If anything happens to Dominic, Evelyn Ashbourne won't take it well. He is her brother."

A cold glint flashed in Evelyn's eyes. "The Ashbournes are obstacles. Let's remove them permanently."

Harvey broke into a cold sweat.

Elsie's hand trembled as she poured wine. The image of Harrison—his roguish grin—flashed through her mind.

Why do these men obsess over Evelyn? My devotion should be enough.

Eden laughed heartily. "Bold as ever, Mr. Chambers!"

Evelyn smirked. "When's the wedding? I'll bring a generous gift."

"Soon. Whether it happens depends on your help, Colonel." His smile turned cruel. "I need two men dead."

"Who?"

"Sebastian. And Dominic."

Eden paled. "You're joking! Cassius Ashbourne's father is the richest man in Skyrim! If I'm linked to this—"

"I've covered every angle." Evelyn leaned closer. "The man they're after? One of your key operatives."

Eden's eyes widened.

"They're trespassing on your turf. The royal family won't tolerate it. Eliminate them first—earn their favor."

Temptation flickered in Eden's gaze.

"And in Country T, they're fish out of water. Dispose of the bodies at sea—no one will know."

Evelyn's voice dropped. "You're the best at this."

Eden licked his lips. "What's in it for me?"

"Name your price."

Eden's gaze slid to Elsie.

Evelyn yanked her arm, sending her crashing into Eden's lap.

"Tonight, she's yours."

Without a backward glance, Evelyn left.

Elsie lay broken on the bed, her red dress in tatters.

The door opened.

Evelyn stared at her bruised body. "I didn't expect him to share my brother's tastes."

Tears spilled down Elsie's cheeks. "Did you ever... love me? Even a little?"

Evelyn laughed coldly. "If I'd known you'd be this pathetic, I wouldn't have saved you."

The door slammed shut.

Rain lashed against Sebastian as he pushed forward.

Dominic matched his pace, impressed by his stamina.

Military training had honed Sebastian—privilege hadn't softened him.

Dominic admitted grudgingly: Sebastian might be the only man who could truly protect Evelyn.

"What a pity," he muttered.

"What?"

Before Dominic could answer, gunfire erupted.

Sebastian tackled him as bullets tore through the air.

Dominic's heart raced. A second slower, and he'd have been Swiss cheese.

"Thanks."

"Ambush. Stay sharp—unless you want Evelyn to lose both of us tonight."

Their men scattered under heavy fire.

"Who tipped them off?" Dominic reloaded.

Sebastian's eyes narrowed. "Someone with ties to Ward—and a grudge against us."

A name burned in his mind: Evelyn Chambers.
###Chapter 415

Thaddeus Abernathy had no doubt about Avery Chambers' involvement.

Ever since Avery had re-entered Evadne Ashbourne's life, Thaddeus had been meticulously investigating his ties to the Chambers family, his dealings in Elmsworth, and his activities in Helgen over the years.

Avery was cunning—most classified information remained beyond Thaddeus' reach—but his underworld connections in Helgen and his company, which fronted as a real estate and gambling enterprise while engaging in illicit operations, were no secret. His extensive network, the collusion between officials and businessmen, and the powerful protection he enjoyed had allowed him to thrive.

More alarmingly, Avery had deep ties to the military and political circles in Country T.

Thaddeus was certain Avery had the means to leak information to Country T and orchestrate their silent elimination in the chaos.

Even if the Abernathy and Ashbourne families pursued justice, they'd find no bodies, no evidence—just a dead end.

Cassius Ashbourne noticed Thaddeus' grim expression. "You know who's behind this, don't you?"

Thaddeus exhaled sharply. "Not the time. Let's focus on surviving first."

He couldn't accuse Avery without proof—it would make him look petty and damage his own credibility.

Cassius' eyes hardened. "Tell me."

Like his sister Evadne, Cassius was relentless.

Thaddeus clenched his jaw. "If they're from Helgen's underworld, I can't be sure. But if they're Country T's military... I'm ninety percent certain."

Before Cassius could press further, a voice boomed through a loudspeaker:

"This is a military-controlled zone. Lay down your weapons and surrender, or we will open fire!"

Cassius tensed. "The military?"

He hadn't expected their pursuit of a fugitive to draw Country T's armed forces. Who the hell was this Ward?

Thaddeus smirked bitterly. Avery. It had to be you.

The humid jungle air turned frigid with tension.

"Don't listen to their lies," Cassius warned, eyes sharp. "The moment we surrender, we're dead. I've used these tactics myself."

Thaddeus glanced at him, surprised. President Ashbourne had lived quite the life.

Footsteps crunched on grass. Thaddeus lowered his voice. "They're closing in. I'll draw them left—you take the others and find Ward's hideout."

"No. I won't leave you."

"If we both die here, you'll regret that choice."

"And if you die, how do I face Evadne?"

The standoff was cut short by approaching danger.

"Cassius," Thaddeus said suddenly.

The name struck Cassius like a blade—sharp, painful.

"Evadne told me her family means everything to her," Thaddeus said, locking eyes with him. "Get back to her."

"What about you? Doesn't she love you?" Cassius' grip tightened, his eyes burning. "She spent thirteen years waiting for you. How many more years of grief do you want to put her through?"

Thaddeus smiled bitterly. "After the divorce, I already died once in her heart. If it happens again... she'll move on."

Without waiting for a reply, he bolted into the darkness like an arrow loosed from its bow.

"Thaddeus!"

Cassius could only watch as Thaddeus vanished into the trees, enemies swarming after him like sharks scenting blood.

Thaddeus was the bait, drawing fire away so Cassius and the others could escape.

He was now ninety percent sure Avery had orchestrated this. If so, he was the target. Separating from Cassius gave them a chance.

Branches slashed his arms and face, but he barely felt it. Gunfire and explosions chased him through the jungle.

His combat experience was the only reason he was still alive.

Avery, you'd better pray I don't make it out of here. If I do, your end is coming.

A bullet tore through his left shoulder.

Agony seared through him, sweat drenching his back. Not fatal, but the pain was excruciating.

Country T's language echoed behind him. The gunfire ahead ceased.

"Mr. Abernathy."

Thaddeus turned, jaw clenched against the pain, to face Ward—grinning, submachine gun in hand.

"Didn't expect to see you so soon. Vacationing in hostile territory?"

His men smirked, weapons trained on Thaddeus. To them, he was just a rich fool they could break.

"Surrender, Ward," Thaddeus said coldly.

Laughter erupted. "Catch me yourself, Abernathy. Oh wait—can you even lift that arm?"

Thaddeus didn't flinch.

Ward's smirk faded. "Fine. Keep stalling, and you'll lose that arm."

Before he finished, Thaddeus raised his gun.

The mercenaries tensed, barrels aimed.

Ward arched a brow. Even now, Thaddeus dared to threaten him?

"Shoot me, and you die too," Ward sneered.

"I don't care." Thaddeus' voice was steel. "But believe this—my bullet will blow your head off. Test me."

Ward's face twisted. He'd done his homework. Thaddeus wasn't some spoiled heir—he was a decorated marksman.

"Your life's worth more than mine," Ward taunted. "Die here, and that pretty widow of yours will mourn forever."

Evadne's name was a knife to Thaddeus' heart.

He loved her. He ached for more time with her. But that didn't change his resolve.

A henchman muttered to Ward in their tongue. "Boss said take him alive."

Ward's eyes gleamed. "Rich boy's worth millions in ransom. Capture him!"

Greed lit their faces. Alive, he was a goldmine. Dead? Just a corpse.

Thaddeus seized the opportunity.

He fired, dropping men one by one. But his bullets ran out.

Unarmed, injured, he was at a disadvantage.

Yet he refused to be taken.

Snatching a fallen gun, he fired twice at Ward.

Ward dodged, using a lackey as a shield. The man collapsed, chest bleeding.

"Should've surrendered," Ward spat, raising his submachine gun. "Now you die."

Just then—

A roar of rotors split the night.

"Ward! Touch my man, and I'll skin you alive!"

The voice—clear, icy, furious—rang from above.

Thaddeus' heart stopped.

A white helicopter hovered, a rope ladder dangling. A woman stood on it, silver Desert Eagle gleaming, hair whipping in the wind. Moonlight bathed her, turning her into a radiant, terrifying angel.

No one else could be so breathtaking yet deadly.

Thaddeus' eyes burned. His lips curved.

His woman had come.

His queen had arrived.
###Chapter 416

The entire group froze in unison, their gazes locked onto the sky above.

If angels truly walked among mortals, this woman was their living embodiment. If goddesses descended to earth, she was their chosen vessel.

In the stunned silence, Evelyn's eyes narrowed. With practiced precision, she loaded her weapon and fired three consecutive shots at Ward.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Missed.

She adjusted her stance and fired again.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Rage burned through Evelyn’s veins, her focus unshakable as she emptied her clip toward Ward.

The Desert Eagle’s recoil was brutal, but Evelyn handled it like a seasoned marksman—her training evident in every controlled movement.

Yet, despite her skill, not a single bullet found its mark.

Ward moved like a shadow, darting through the jungle with unnatural speed.

"Elijah!" Evelyn shouted, frustration lacing her voice. "Can’t you get any lower? He’s still out of range!"

"I’m already skimming the treetops!" Elijah’s knuckles whitened around the controls, sweat beading on his brow. The relentless gunfire had his heart hammering against his ribs. "Evelyn, what the hell were you thinking? Get back here!"

"No!" Her eyes blazed with fury. "I want him to know what happens when he touches what’s mine!"

Another shot rang out, grazing one of Ward’s men.

Thaddeus tracked her every move, his body coiled tight with tension. Admiration warred with terror—he was too far to shield her, and the thought clawed at him.

"Damn it!" Elijah’s voice cracked. "I never should’ve let you come! This is the worst idea you’ve ever had!"

Desperate, he banked hard, ready to drag her back by force if necessary.

But Evelyn was faster.

She released the ladder and leaped.

"Evelyn!" Elijah’s heart stopped.

The wind roared in her ears as she plummeted. In that freefall, her mind cleared. All that mattered was reaching Thaddeus—standing beside him, fighting with him, even dying with him if it came to that.

Just as he had once shielded her in Zenithia’s war-torn streets, carving a path through blood and chaos.

Now, she would do the same for him.

Her breath hitched.

The truth struck her like lightning.

Thaddeus owed her nothing.

Thirteen years ago, he had saved her life. On Zenithia’s battlefield, he had given her a chance to survive.

Even if she had dragged him to safety afterward, without him, she would’ve been dead before dawn.

Their failed marriage paled in the face of life and death.

What mattered more than survival?

Without Thaddeus, there was no more.

Her body hurtled toward the earth—

"Evelyn!" Thaddeus’s heart lurched.

Pain forgotten, he sprinted forward, arms outstretched.

The impact wrenched his wounded shoulder open again, blood soaking through his shirt. But he barely registered it, relief flooding him as he caught her. A faint smile touched his lips.

She was his solace, his strength.

Holding her, he could endure anything.

Evelyn inhaled sharply, the metallic tang of blood thick in the air. His labored breaths shuddered against her, and tears spilled onto his chest.

"Liar," she choked out, pounding her fists against him. "You idiot! You could’ve died!"

Thaddeus cradled her like something precious, his thumb brushing her nape. "I was afraid you’d follow me."

Her voice broke. "And you weren’t afraid I’d worry?"

The question stunned him. A lifetime of believing himself unworthy of such care unraveled in an instant.

But there was no time for revelations.

In the next breath, Thaddeus shoved her behind him, snatched up a fallen machine gun, and mowed down the assassins ahead.

Evelyn didn’t hesitate. Back-to-back, she fired at the ones behind them.

A memory flickered in Thaddeus’s mind—Paloma.

The girl in the white coat from Zenithia.

He’d never seen her again.

Yet now, watching Evelyn fight, the resemblance was uncanny.

"Ward’s getting away!" Evelyn bolted after him.

"Evelyn, stop! It’s a trap—"

Thaddeus swayed, vision blurring. The chill of blood loss crept through his limbs, but he forced himself forward, leaving a crimson trail in his wake.

Star Island’s jungle was a labyrinth.

Brambles tore at Evelyn’s skin, but she barely noticed. Her focus was singular—catch Ward.

Then her foot snagged something hidden.

Her instincts screamed.

She twisted away just as a steel cage erupted from the ground, snapping shut where she’d stood.

Cold sweat slicked her brow. One second slower, and she’d have been trapped.

A chuckle slithered from the shadows.

"Show yourself, Ward!"

Her ears, honed from years of training, pinpointed his location. She raised her gun—

And froze.

Empty.

Panic spiked. Her spare ammo was gone, likely lost when she dodged the trap. She spotted it a few paces away—

Two bullets kicked up dirt at her feet. A warning.

Ward stepped into view, crossbow leveled at her chest. "Impressive, Ms. Ashbourne. You’re the first to escape my traps." His smirk widened. "No wonder Thaddeus fell for you."

"Enough." Her voice was ice. "Surrender and testify against Elspeth, or tonight is your end."

Ward laughed. "You rich brats really think you’re untouchable?"

"Touch me," she hissed, "and my brothers will burn Star Island to the ground. Your head will rot on a pike. Try me."

The threat gave him pause.

Unlike Thaddeus, this woman wasn’t bluffing. The Ashbourne brothers were notorious, and their father commanded even royalty’s respect.

Seizing his hesitation, Evelyn lunged for her ammo.

Ward fired.

Time slowed.

Evelyn braced for impact—

Then Thaddeus was there, taking the arrow meant for her.

Her world shattered.

He crumpled against her, his face ashen but his gaze tender. "Evelyn... you okay?"

Tears blurred her vision.

"I’m fine," he murmured, hand stroking her back. "I’m..."

His eyes rolled back.

"Thaddeus? Thaddeus!" She clutched him, screaming his name, but he didn’t stir.

"Evelyn! Thaddeus!"

Elijah’s voice cut through the chaos.

Cassius, Jareth, and the others arrived in a storm of gunfire. Two shots from Cassius shattered Ward’s kneecap and arm.

Ward still crawled toward his weapon.

Elijah stomped on his hand, bones crunching under his boot.

A scream ripped through the night.

The remaining assassins were subdued, their hideout raided. Weapons of mass destruction were uncovered, but there was no time to linger—Thaddeus needed a hospital now.

As they loaded him onto the helicopter, Evelyn clung to his hand, her tears falling unchecked.

"Why?" she sobbed. "Why couldn’t I see your worth sooner?"

Cassius pulled her into his arms. "He’ll make it," he whispered, though his own voice wavered. "God protects those who love fiercely."

Jareth, usually quick with a joke, stood silent, fists clenched.

The helicopter blades whirred to life, carrying Thaddeus toward the capital’s best surgeons.

Evelyn pressed her palms to her eyes, but the tears wouldn’t stop.

Cassius held her tighter. "He’ll live," he vowed, as if saying it could make it true. "For you. For both of you."

And in that moment, he would’ve traded his own life to ensure it.
###Chapter 417

The moment Thaddeus collapsed, Jareth didn't hesitate. He hauled his bleeding, barely conscious friend into the nearest high-end medical facility in Country T's capital.

Jareth wasn't the type to cry. But seeing Thaddeus—pale as death, barely breathing—being wheeled into emergency surgery? His chest tightened. Tears pricked at his eyes before he angrily swiped them away.

"Mr. Fairhaven."

A crisp voice cut through the sterile hospital air. Jareth spun around.

"You are?"

The man looked vaguely familiar. Someone Evadne had brought to that exclusive wine event at the Abernathy Hotel.

"Chanel. But you can call me Dr. Bright."

Before Jareth could respond, Chanel—already in scrubs—brushed past him. His voice was calm, steady. "Your friend is in good hands."

"You—you're a doctor?" Jareth's eyes widened. "Weren't you in Elmsworth? How the hell did you get here?"

"Cassius called me."

At the mention of Cassius, Chanel's expression darkened. His pulse kicked up. That infuriating, intriguing man. "He didn't give details. Just said he was handling something dangerous and might need backup. So I've been waiting here all night."

With a smirk, Chanel added, "Almost left. Good thing I didn't. Without me? Your friend wouldn't stand a chance."

Damn Cassius.

Even after wrapping Chanel around his finger, he still dragged him into this mess. Chanel—renowned in elite circles, pursued by countless—was reduced to a lovesick fool for that composed, unreadable man.

As Chanel pushed through the ER doors, Jareth shouted, "Hey! Can I trust you? His life's in your hands!"

Without turning, Chanel scoffed. "Hmph. Dr. Eve isn't the only skilled surgeon in the world."

Tonight's operation had crushed the arms dealer syndicate. But it also pissed off Country T's power players.

Ward was captured, but news had already reached local authorities. Now, they were trapped—unable to return to Elmsworth. No extradition treaty meant no backup from Aaron.

The situation was spiraling.

With no way home, Evadne decided to stay near Thaddeus at the hospital after securing Star Island.

Elvis kept Ward locked in one car. Evadne and Cassius rode in another.

Her fingers clenched around Cassius's. He covered her icy hand with his warm one, gaze heavy with concern.

"Evadne."

She looked up, eyes swollen, tears brimming.

It was like her soul had left her body—floating somewhere with Thaddeus, leaving behind an empty shell.

Cassius sighed. Unbuttoning his shirt, he removed the silver cross necklace he'd worn for years.

"When Thaddeus wakes up, give this to him."

He pressed the necklace into her palm, closing her fingers around it.

"Cassius, this is—?"

"Not worth much money. But it's kept me safe through every danger." His voice softened. "Right now? All we can do is pray he's strong enough to pull through."

Evadne broke. Sobs wracked her frame.

Cassius pulled her close. "Don't cry. When he wakes up, treat him better. At least stop causing him trouble."

The Ashbourne family arrived at the hospital. Jareth was already waiting in the underground garage.

Evadne sprinted toward him, eyes wild. "How is he?!"

"In surgery. By someone you know."

"Chanel?" Her mind was razor-sharp.

She turned to Cassius. He met her gaze, unreadable.

"Yeah. Three hours already." Jareth's voice cracked. "Evadne, I heard Dr. Bright is from Suri. Can we trust him? He acts like some lazy gamer. If he's not up to it, maybe you should step in. Didn't you operate on Thaddeus before?"

Silence.

"Gamer? Really?"

Elvis leaned against the car window, cigarette dangling. "Your Fairhaven education is lacking."

"Whatever. You get my point." Jareth grumbled, not in the mood to argue with Evadne's brother.

"Dr. Bright's skills rival Dr. Eve's."

Cassius's icy tone cut through the tension. "As a Fairhaven, you should know—there's always someone better."

Evadne and Elvis exchanged glances.

Was Cassius... defending Chanel?

Jareth—used to privilege—usually missed subtleties. But even he felt the chill in Cassius's gaze. He backpedaled fast. "I just—if President Ashbourne brought him, he must be good. I'm just worried."

"Dr. Bright is better than me." Evadne's voice broke. "Once Thaddeus stabilizes, we'll need his expertise. He's a neurology specialist."

Her words faded into a whisper.

Jareth had no response. Comfort wasn't his forte.

Fury rolled off him. "That bastard in the car—before we hand him over, he's paying!"

Tires screeched. A line of cars flooded the garage, heading straight for them.

"Bad news," Cassius muttered, pulling Evadne close.

"Very bad," she agreed, watching the approaching figures.

A high-ranking police official stepped out, flanked by armed officers.

They surrounded the group.

Elvis and Jareth tensed, ready to fight.

Ward—bound and gagged—recognized his savior. He writhed, muffled screams pleading for help.

Without a word, Elvis stabbed a dagger into Ward's thigh.

Ward convulsed in silent agony.

"Behave," Elvis warned, lighting a cigarette. "Or I'll think of a hundred worse things to do to you."

Ward froze. The Ashbourne heir was terrifying.

"We received reports of a hostage," the official barked. "Release him immediately. Surrender your weapons. Resist, and you'll face our full wrath."

Evadne laughed. "Your laws? A joke."

The official sneered. "Bold words for someone facing life in prison."

Ward smirked.

Elvis punched him. Blood gushed from his nose.

"The hostage is a criminal," Evadne spat. "Smuggling weapons, drugs—everything illegal. And you protect him. Where's your justice?"

Jareth grinned. "Damn. Tell him!"

The official's face purpled with rage.

"But Ward's crimes here? Not my concern." Evadne's smile was glacial. "What I care about? He murdered an innocent girl in my country. He's coming back with me—dead or alive."

"This man is ours!" the official roared. "Our laws apply! You have no authority here!"

At his signal, officers surged forward.

Cassius and Jareth shielded Evadne.

Elvis, still in the car, gripped his gun. Ready to fight.

The moment an officer grabbed Cassius, he twisted the man's arm and flung him.

The officer crashed to the ground, arm dislocated, tailbone shattered.

"Damn," Jareth breathed. "That was cool."

"You dare attack an officer?!" the official bellowed. "Take them down!"

Chaos erupted.

Evadne's eyes burned. She was ready to burn this place to the ground.

Then—

A car horn blared.

Everyone froze.

A sleek limo rolled into the garage, its silver roof gleaming under the dim lights.

Tension spiked.

Every nerve was on edge.
###Chapter 418

"Who the hell is this now?" Jareth growled, his jaw clenched in frustration.

He cursed himself and Thaddeus for rushing into this unprepared. They hadn’t brought enough manpower to deal with someone of this caliber.

Back in Elmsworth, even the mayor wouldn’t dare cross him. But here? A mere general was nothing.

"You’re a grown man, yet you panic like a headless chicken at the slightest challenge."

Elvis smirked, the cigarette between his lips bobbing as he spoke. But his grip on the gun was iron-tight. "I don’t care who’s coming. We’ll handle them all."

"Fair enough."

Jareth nodded, then snapped, "Who’s a headless chicken? You’re the damn chicken!"

Elvis just whistled, unfazed. "Even if I am, I’m still at the top of the pecking order. I outshine you any day."

Jareth seethed, unable to argue or fight back.

Just then, Evadne and the others noticed the entire parking lot had been cordoned off.

Rows of royal guards in crisp uniforms flooded the area, lining up with military precision.

The general immediately stepped aside, saluting with rigid formality.

"Well, well," Elvis mused. "Looks like someone important is making quite the entrance."

"From the looks of it, royalty," Cassius muttered darkly. "And given the corruption here, I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re protecting the very people we’re after."

His hand on Evadne’s shoulder was warm, steady. "Don’t worry. No matter who shows up, I won’t let anything happen to you."

Evadne covered his hand with hers. "We face this together. I’m not a little girl anymore—I can protect you too."

Cassius smiled, pride softening his sharp features. "Right. Our little girl has grown up."

The sleek black limousine rolled to a stop. Guards rushed to open the doors with practiced reverence.

Two figures emerged—one from each side.

From the left stepped a striking woman in an embroidered blue silk gown, radiating wealth and authority.

"Your Highness, the Duchess!"

The crowd dropped to one knee in unison, making the scene feel like something out of a historical drama.

Then, the woman on the right appeared.

Elegant. Regal. Her pristine white dress shimmered under the dim light, a diamond brooch glinting at her chest—a birthday gift from Alexander three years prior.

She treasured it dearly.

Seeing the Duchess and the woman walking hand in hand, the general paled and bowed deeply.

"G-Good day, Madam President!"

He never imagined the Duchess was close friends with the wife of Helgen’s president—so close they seemed like sisters.

"Debby!" Evadne gasped, her eyes welling up.

Cassius and Elvis stiffened in shock. "Debby?"

"Evadne." Debby’s voice trembled as she looked at her family. "Cassius. Elvis."

The Duchess gasped, covering her mouth. "They’re your family? No wonder you insisted on coming! It’s wonderful to meet them!"

"I’ve always wanted to bring you to Skyrim," Debby said softly. "But I never expected our reunion to be like this."

Composing herself, she strode forward.

As she passed the general, her warm gaze turned glacial. The man who’d been so arrogant moments ago now shrank under her presence.

Power. Authority. It radiated from her, demanding submission.

The general’s legs wobbled.

He never dreamed the wife of Helgen’s president was connected to these "criminals."

"Debby, why did you come alone?" Evadne rushed to her, frantic. "You and Alexander are high-profile targets. You should have guards!"

She’d only asked Debby to pull strings with the royal family—not come in person.

"I couldn’t stay away after hearing what happened." Debby cupped Evadne’s face, her own eyes glistening. "Are you hurt? Is everyone okay?"

"We’re fine. But Thaddeus—" Evadne bit her lip hard.

"Dr. Bright’s nephew is with him," Cassius cut in, jaw tight. "He’s one of the best. Thaddeus will pull through."

Debby exhaled in relief. "Good. With him there, Thaddeus will be fine." She wiped Evadne’s tears. "You always said he was unbreakable. He won’t die before giving you the grand wedding you deserve."

Evadne flushed. "Who said I want to marry him?"

After a quick exchange, Debby turned her icy gaze to the police chief. "Your Highness, my family came here for a peaceful vacation. We didn’t expect such a... warm welcome from your chief of police."

The chief’s teeth ground together, sweat beading on his brow.

The princess’s voice dripped with displeasure. "Chief Leonard, why have you surrounded my guests with armed men?"

"Your Highness, they broke our laws and killed our citizens!" Leonard stood his ground. "It’s my duty to arrest them!"

The princess had no real political power. He gambled that the authorities wouldn’t side with foreigners over their own.

"Citizens?" Debby scoffed. "The man they caught isn’t even from this country. And those shot were murderers protected by arms dealers. You turn a blind eye to their crimes yet dare to accuse us?"

Leonard choked on his words.

The princess deliberated, then said coolly, "Chief Leonard, kneel and apologize. Then assist in extraditing the real criminal."

Evadne’s eyes lit up. She squeezed Debby’s hand—they’d won.

"Not bad for Debby’s best friend," Jareth remarked, impressed.

Elvis smirked. "Since when are you two so close?"

Jareth glowered. "She’s Evadne’s friend, so she’s mine too."

Meanwhile, Ward sat in the car, his face red with panic.

"Your Highness, I was following orders!" Leonard refused to kneel. "This matter should be decided by the king!"

"Whose orders?" the princess pressed.

Just then, a man in royal attire approached and bowed.

"Who’s that?" Evadne whispered.

"The king’s personal secretary," Debby murmured. "Low rank, immense power."

The princess arched a brow. "Have you brought the king’s decree?"

Leonard smirked, confident the king wouldn’t upend decades of political balance for outsiders.

The secretary’s face turned grave. "By order of His Majesty, Chief Leonard is hereby dismissed and arrested for corruption, collusion, and dereliction of duty."

Silence.

The king had acted—for them?

The princess shot Debby a discreet thumbs-up, making her blush.

Ward nearly fainted.

"I was following Colonel Eden’s orders!" Leonard wailed, dropping to his knees. "He pressured me!"

The princess’s expression darkened.

So did Evadne’s and Debby’s.

The situation had been defused—thanks to Debby’s influence.

As Helgen’s first lady and close friend of the queen, her word carried weight. With recent diplomatic ties between their nations, the royals couldn’t afford to slight her.

When Leonard was stripped of his badge and dragged away, his legs gave out completely.

The queen embraced Debby before leaving, her eyes wet. "When will I see you again?"

"Soon," Debby promised, wiping her tears.

"You’re always busy."

"But we’ll always find a way."

Watching the limousine vanish, Debby sighed.

"I’m jealous," Evadne teased, linking arms with her. "You and the queen are so close."

Debby tapped her nose. "You’re the one surrounded by loyal friends, devoted subordinates, and a man who’d die for you."

Evadne’s heart skipped at the thought of Thaddeus.

"But the queen?" Debby smiled wistfully. "She only has me."
###Chapter 419

The royal decree was issued, shattering Nathaniel's hopes of survival in Country T.

This wasn't just about him. The royal family saw this as an opportunity to weaken the military's influence and strike a devastating blow to the underworld. Beneath the surface, a fierce power struggle raged between the crown and the armed forces.

Otherwise, a mere pawn like Nathaniel wouldn't have warranted such attention.

These were the details Arabella later shared with Evelyn. But Evelyn, sharp as ever, had already pieced it together.

What troubled her more was a name—Eden. The military officer Lucas had betrayed.

Something about this felt off. Suspicious.

But she couldn't dwell on it now. Her thoughts were consumed by one thing: when would Alexander wake up?

Nathaniel was locked up, awaiting deportation. Back in Elmsworth, Adrian had already briefed his superiors. He boarded a red-eye flight with his team to retrieve their target.

Dawn approached.

The hospital corridor was eerily silent, the air thick with tension.

Daniel and Dominic were glued to their phones—one coordinating with Adrian mid-flight, the other soothing his wife, Lillian, at home. He stole glances at the video call, watching her peaceful sleeping face.

Daniel's heart ached as he stared at Isabella on the screen. The longing was unbearable, his eyes burning with unshed tears.

Red-eyed, he traced her image with his fingertips, then leaned in, pressing a kiss to the screen.

"Seriously? Kissing your phone?" Dominic teased, startling Daniel, who quickly ended the call, not wanting to wake her.

"Mind your own business," Daniel snapped.

"Why would I? You're a walking joke!"

Dominic rolled his eyes. "If this is what love does, I'll stay single forever."

"Good. With that attitude, no woman would tolerate you anyway," Daniel shot back.

"You wanna keep this up?" Dominic raised a brow. "Should I tell your precious Isabella about how you chased after my sister? Let’s see how long you last on durian knees."

Damn him.

Daniel clenched his fists but held back. The only thing he feared was his wife's wrath.

"I don’t get it," Dominic mused. "Alexander’s usually so composed. How did he end up so close to you?"

The word idiot nearly slipped out.

"Hey! Without me, his journey would’ve been ten times harder!"

Ignoring the jab, Daniel’s expression darkened with concern. "Do you think Alexander chooses not to have friends? He just... can’t."

Dominic took a drag of his cigarette. "Why? Some psychological issue?"

"Got any manners?" Daniel scowled.

"If it’s not that, why did he reject my sister and end up with that cheating ex?"

Though Dominic had let go of his grudge, old habits died hard. The thought still made him want to punch Alexander—forgetting the man was fighting for his life.

"It’s his past. Bullied as a kid, he hid his wounds to spare his mother. Always brought her good news, never the bad."

"Damn those little monsters," Dominic muttered, crushing his cigarette pack. "Why didn’t he fight back? He’s an Abernathy!"

"You think one kid can take on a mob?" Daniel’s voice cracked.

Dominic fell silent, fists tightening.

"You—the legitimate heir, doted on since birth. Even me, raised in a loving home. We’ve never known Alexander’s pain. The weight of being the illegitimate son, the constant walking on eggshells."

Dominic exhaled sharply. Alexander’s life had been hell.

"So, all these years, he’s only had me. He’s built walls. Doesn’t trust easily. And he’s used to being alone."

But no one wants to be alone.

Sometimes, it’s the only choice.

"I take it back," Dominic said suddenly.

"What?"

"Your family upbringing wasn’t bad. At least you didn’t join in when others bullied him."

Daniel’s mind flashed to Edith Fairhaven—the chaos she’d caused, the cruelty she’d shown Isabella. He’d failed as a brother, letting his sister become a monster.

"You’re clueless, but you’re decent," Dominic admitted, clapping his shoulder. "From now on, Alexander won’t just have you."

Daniel’s heart skipped.

But Dominic was already walking away, vanishing like a cool breeze.

In the corridor outside the ER, Cassius and Arabella kept Evelyn company, waiting for Chase’s surgery to end.

"Sweetheart, it’s a long procedure. Rest for a bit," Arabella urged, feeling Evelyn’s trembling hands.

"I’m fine. I’ll wait here."

Evelyn blinked hard. "How could I sleep now?"

"Evelyn," Cassius cut in, serious. "What do you think about General Eden?"

Arabella frowned. "Cassius, give her a break. We can discuss this later. My husband’s already investigating. No one will get away with this."

"It’s okay," Evelyn said softly. "I want to talk about it."

She turned to Cassius. "Your mission on Star Island was classified. Alexander’s meticulous. There’s no way intel leaked. Even if Nathaniel’s men tipped someone off, why involve the military? It’s too calculated."

"Exactly. I think Eden’s men weren’t there for Nathaniel. They were targeting us."

Cassius recalled Alexander’s words, his breath hitching. "Alexander said he’s 90% sure who sent them, but we didn’t have time to discuss it."

Evelyn’s eyes widened. "Alexander met Eden? How?"

"No. He thinks someone here is colluding with Eden, using military power to eliminate threats."

Domestic?

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. Who had that kind of influence—and malice?

"I’ve got people digging into Eden’s local ties. Anyone in Elmsworth’s elite with connections to the Tide is a suspect." Cassius’s grim tone sent chills down their spines.

"When Alexander wakes up, he’ll give us answers," Arabella said.

Just then, Evelyn swayed.

"Evelyn, are you okay?" Cassius asked, concerned.

The ER doors burst open.

A nurse in bloodied scrubs rushed out. "We’re out of blood! The patient needs an immediate transfusion!"

"I’ll do it!" Evelyn stepped forward.

She remembered the last time Alexander needed blood—she’d been incompatible. Not this time.

"Me too!" Arabella raised her hand.

"Us too!" Daniel and Dominic volunteered. They’d give a kidney if needed.

"The patient is Rh-negative. Are you all matches?" The nurse was frantic.

Evelyn’s heart sank.

Rh-negative was rare. There wasn’t time to source more.

"Alexander’s a panda blood type? Of course he is," Dominic muttered, anxiety making him blunt.

"Dominic!" Cassius snapped.

Just then, a calm voice cut through the panic.

"I’m Rh-negative. I’ll donate."

Arabella gasped, tears welling. "Darcy!"

Evelyn was stunned.

Her brother-in-law, the President of Helgen, stood before them.

"Debby, I’m sorry I’m late," Darcy murmured, pulling Arabella into his arms. His voice cracked. "Do you know how terrified I was when I heard you came alone? What would I do without you?"

"Find another First Lady," she teased, melting into his embrace.

"Never." He kissed her hair. "Without you, none of this matters."

Watching them, Evelyn felt a pang of envy.

If only she could have that—openly loving someone, building a life together.

Alexander, wake up.

Or my future will taste like ashes.

Without delay, Darcy followed the nurse into the ER.

Arabella stared at the closed doors, sweating with worry.

"Darcy’s health isn’t great," Cassius said gently. "Can he handle this?"

"He’ll be fine," Arabella insisted, though fear flickered in her eyes.

Evelyn hugged her tightly, wordless gratitude in the embrace.

Time crawled.

At dawn, the ER lights dimmed. The doors opened.

Exhausted, they surged forward.

Evelyn’s heart pounded as Dr. Bright emerged, his scrubs stained, his face pale.

He removed his mask, revealing bloodshot eyes.

"Dr. Bright, how is Alexander?" Evelyn rasped.

"Mr. Abernathy—"

Chase swayed, vision blurring.

"Dr. Bright!"

Cassius lunged, catching him before he collapsed.

"Easy," Cassius murmured, holding him steady.

Chase blinked up at him, warmth flooding his chest.
###Chapter 420

Cassius's pulse quickened under that intense gaze, his cheeks flushing crimson.

"You're pushing yourself too hard. You look exhausted."

"Is that concern I hear?" Chasel's eyes sparkled with amusement.

Cassius swallowed hard before murmuring, "Yes."

That single word shattered Chasel's defenses. Every lingering resentment toward Cassius evaporated instantly.

He was powerless against this man—utterly, hopelessly smitten.

"I've operated on Mr. Abernathy. The bullet in his left shoulder and the arrow in his back have been removed."

Cassius helped Chasel sit up, the latter subtly leaning into his touch. "He's lucky the arrow wasn't poisoned. Otherwise, it would've been fatal. Even so, his condition is critical. The arrow missed his vital organs by a mere centimeter. If it had struck any deeper, not even Dr. Eve could've saved him."

A heavy silence fell over the room. Evadne's slender frame trembled, an invisible weight crushing her chest. Tears welled in her eyes.

As a doctor—as Dr. Eve—she understood exactly what Chasel's words implied. Thaddeus was teetering on the edge of death.

"And now? How is he now?" Jareth demanded impatiently.

"Despite removing the projectiles and administering a blood transfusion, his organs are showing signs of failure due to severe blood loss." Chasel maintained his professional composure. "Mr. Abernathy remains in critical condition."

The air grew thick with despair. Evadne felt ice-cold, as if every drop of blood had drained from her body.

In the past, Thaddeus would've sensed her distress instantly—offering his jacket, pulling her into his arms, shielding her from the world's harshness. No matter how fiercely she presented herself, to him, she would always be the girl who needed protecting.

"Can I see him?"

After a long pause, Evadne lifted her pale face, unshed tears glistening in her eyes.

"He's being transferred to the ICU. You'll have to wait until he stabilizes," Chasel replied gently.

Evadne nodded, her voice barely above a whisper. "Okay. I'll wait."

Chasel wasn't an emotional man, but seeing Evadne so shattered twisted something inside him.

After his transfusion, Darcy was moved to a recovery ward.

"Are you feeling alright? If you're uncomfortable, tell me immediately. Don't push yourself."

Debby hovered by her husband's side, her heart aching at how aged he looked overnight. "Remember when you ignored your appendicitis to lecture at the university? You collapsed right after and needed emergency surgery. The doctor said if you'd arrived any later—" Her voice cracked. "You never take care of yourself, and it terrifies me."

"Having you by my side is all the care I need." Darcy tenderly pinched her cheek, his gaze overflowing with affection.

"I'm serious!" Debby poked his waist playfully.

"Just a bit lightheaded and weak. Nothing more." He offered her a reassuring smile. "I asked the secretary to prepare soup for us."

"If you're going to eat, at least have something substantial—lamb or fish. Soup alone won't cut it." Evadne entered with a half-teasing tone. "Save the soup for when Debby's in labor."

"Evadne!" Debby's face flushed scarlet. "We haven't even discussed that yet!"

"Evadne's right." Darcy laced his fingers through his wife's. "Our careers are stable now, the election's over. Debby, it's time we expanded our family. I know how much you adore children. You've sacrificed so much for me these years. From now on, let's focus on our happiness."

"Darcy..." Debby leaned closer, tracing his handsome features with a smile as bright as a schoolgirl's. "Choosing you was my decision. You owe me nothing. If anything, you've given me everything."

Overcome, Darcy pulled her into a searing kiss, oblivious to their audience.

Initially shy, Debby soon melted into the embrace.

Evadne turned away, pressing her forehead against the wall as silent tears fell. She was genuinely happy for her sister.

Though Emeric had initially opposed their union—concerned about the age gap and Debby relocating to Helgen—every interaction between the couple radiated undeniable love.

When they finally parted, Debby was breathless. Darcy, however, remained composed, keeping an arm around her as he addressed Evadne.

"Don't worry. I spoke with the King of Country T last night. He's assigned the new Chief of Police to apprehend Eden. Once captured, we'll uncover who targeted Thaddeus and Cassius."

Despite being Cassius's elder brother-in-law by nearly a decade and now a head of state, Darcy remained humble and warm with his wife's family.

"Thank you, Darcy." Evadne's voice trembled with gratitude. "And thank you for donating blood to Thaddeus. It means everything."

"Don't mention it. If I couldn't do this much, what kind of brother-in-law would I be?" Darcy rubbed his neck sheepishly.

Just then, his phone rang. Recognizing the King's number, he answered immediately.

As the conversation progressed, Evadne noticed Darcy's expression darkening. Her stomach knotted with dread.

"What's wrong?" Debby asked the moment he hung up.

"Eden isn't in Country T. He's abroad." Darcy's tone was grave.

"Abroad? Did someone tip him off?" Evadne's brows furrowed.

"No. He's been in your country for a while. He wasn't in Country T when the attack happened."

"Where is he?!"

"Elmsworth."

Evadne's fists clenched. Cassius's words echoed in her mind—Thaddeus had suspected collusion with the enemy. And he'd seemed certain of the traitor's identity.

Someone in Elmsworth.

Why had he been so sure?

There was only one explanation: he knew this person intimately.

"Evadne." Debby hesitated before continuing softly, "With everything that happened yesterday, I didn't get to ask... What's your relationship with Mr. Chambers? Are you still close?"

"Avery and I are just friends." Evadne's gaze was unreadable. "We spent time together as children. After he moved to Helgen, we lost touch until he returned recently. He's helped me tremendously this past year—even saved my life twice."

"I don't doubt his feelings for you. But Evadne, you should distance yourself from him." Debby's tone turned urgent. "Thaddeus is the one who truly loves you. After all he's sacrificed, surely you can reconsider your future together. Avery Chambers is no match for him."

"Mr. Chambers? Which one?" Darcy interjected.

"Avery Chambers."

At the name, Darcy's gentle demeanor vanished. His voice turned icy. "Ah. The Chambers Group. An 'old friend,' you could say."

The words dripped with venom.

"You know Avery? Were you two... at odds in Helgen?" Evadne's eyes widened.

Darcy exhaled sharply. "Avery was known as the 'King of the Night' there—an underground boss controlling a capital group. He colluded with officials, ran illegal casinos, bribed authorities, even dabbled in narcotics! But he always stayed in the shadows. We could never pin anything on him."

Evadne recoiled. The gentle man she knew and the monster Darcy described were polar opposites—an angel and a demon.

"Worse, Avery meddled in Helgen's presidential election."

Debby shuddered, gripping Darcy's hand. "He targeted Darcy specifically, launching media smear campaigns. Thankfully, Darcy's record was spotless. Otherwise, he might've been imprisoned instead of elected."

A chill ran down Evadne's spine. "When did he become like this? How?"

"Helgen's social climate is cutthroat. As an outsider, Avery resorted to extreme measures to establish himself." Darcy's jaw tightened. "But there's a line between ambition and savagery. Cross it, and you're no better than a beast."

Evadne staggered back, her face ashen.

How had Avery concealed such darkness behind that gentle smile?

"That's why, when your brother mentioned a traitor in Elmsworth, my first thought was Avery." Debby studied her sister carefully. "It's just speculation—we have no proof. But please, be cautious around him. I know you value loyalty, but your safety comes first."

"I value loyalty only among those who uphold justice."

Evadne lifted her chin, her gaze hardening. "Whatever hardships he faced abroad don't excuse harming others. But I deserve to hear the truth from him directly."

"Mr. Chambers! You have to help me this time!"

Panicked after learning the King of Country T had ordered his arrest, Eden rushed to Velvet Haven. Leonard was already detained, and even military connections couldn't intervene.

"And how exactly should I help?" Avery swirled his wine, his dark eyes boring into Eden. "The royal family wants you, not me. I'm hardly in a position to interfere."

"This wouldn't have happened if you hadn't pushed me to eliminate Thaddeus and Cassius! You can't abandon me now!"

"Flattering. You acted to curry favor with your superiors." Avery smirked. "Don't pin this on me."

Eden's hands twitched with the urge to strangle him. But on Avery's turf, any rash move would be suicide.

"Fine! I knew you'd betray me!" He bared his teeth. "But I'm not without leverage. I recorded our last conversation. Imagine how your precious Ms. Ashbourne would react upon learning you plotted her brother's murder? So much for your happy ending!"

He drew a finger across his throat.

Avery's eyes flashed—first with shock, then lethal fury.
###Chapter 421

His gaze was terrifying.

It held a bone-chilling malice, a predatory hunger that reminded her of creatures lurking in the darkest abyss, never meant to see daylight.

"You don’t need to look at me like that!" Eden snapped, jaw clenched. "If you weren’t so cunning and unpredictable, I wouldn’t have had to resort to this, old friend!"

Avery’s lips curled into a cold smirk.

"After all these years, I’ve learned one thing about you," Eden continued, voice tight. "You never leave survivors. So I had to find my own way out."

Avery’s eyes narrowed. "Do you really have the recording?" His voice was icy, barely above a whisper.

Eden grinned. "Scared now, aren’t you?"

He leaned back, smug. "Did you think I’d be stupid enough to carry it on me? It’s hidden. If anything happens to me, the whole world hears it by tomorrow."

Avery exhaled sharply. "Name your terms."

When it came to deals, Mr. Chambers didn’t waste time.

"I want a private jet for me and my men," Eden demanded. "And money. A lot of it. I’ve cleaned up two of your messes. You owe me."

"How much?"

"One hundred million. Offshore account. Once it’s transferred, you get the recording, and I disappear."

Eden smirked, arrogance dripping from every word. "We’ve been partners for years. This is nothing for you. Consider it a parting gift."

Harvey, standing nearby, gaped.

Avery didn’t hesitate. "Deal. You’ll have it in three days."

Eden’s eyes flickered—regret. Maybe he should’ve asked for more.

"Stay in Elmsworth until then," Avery warned, swirling his wine. "The Abernathy and Fairhaven groups are hunting you."

"That’s not your concern. Just get me the money."

Harvey escorted Eden out.

The moment the door closed, Avery’s expression darkened. He tilted his glass, letting red wine spill onto the pristine carpet.

"To old friends," he murmured. "And their final journey."

Harvey returned, furious. "You’re really giving that bastard a hundred million?"

Avery’s smile was cold. "Of course. If Evadne finds out, how do I explain?"

He set his glass down. "But dead men don’t spend money."

Harvey’s eyes widened. "You’re going to kill him?"

Avery adjusted his glasses. "He threatened me with Evadne. Did you think I’d let him live?"

"Then why pay him?"

"Because once he leaves Elmsworth," Avery said softly, "he’s mine."

His gaze turned lethal. "Watch him. And the Abernathy and Fairhaven groups. He dies by my hand—not theirs."

Harvey nodded. "Understood."

Thaddeus was finally out of the ICU.

A week had passed since the rescue. Evadne hadn’t left his side, as if he were her lifeline. She barely ate, barely slept.

She was fading.

Tonight, with Cassius and Elvis’s help, she bathed him.

She remembered how particular he was about cleanliness. Even the smallest speck of dust made him discard a suit.

Now, she carefully wiped his body, leaving only his underwear.

Elvis stared at Thaddeus’s unconscious form, then at the obvious bulge. His face twisted with jealousy.

"Damn, is he faking?" Elvis muttered. "I’ve seen unconscious men. None of them were... like that."

He reached out to pinch Thaddeus’s thigh.

Evadne caught his wrist. "What are you doing?"

"Testing him," Elvis said, grinning.

"You don’t need to," Evadne blurted. "He’s always like that."

Silence.

Cassius and Elvis exchanged glances.

Evadne’s face burned. She scrubbed Thaddeus’s arm harder, as if polishing a car.

Cassius cleared his throat. "They were married. This is normal."

Elvis smirked. "Right, right. As long as he’s big, Evadne’s happy—OW!"

Cassius elbowed him sharply.

Evadne finished washing Thaddeus’s front. "Turn him over."

The brothers helped.

Outside, Elvis rubbed his ribs. "You broke me."

Cassius ignored him.

Elvis pouted. "We share the same mother. How could you?"

"You talk too much," Cassius said flatly.

Elvis huffed, then glanced back at the room. "She hasn’t left his side for days. Doesn’t she get bored?"

Cassius sighed. "When you love someone, you’re never bored."

Elvis frowned. "I don’t get it."

"You will," Cassius said softly. "One day."

Just then, Chasel approached, hands in his white coat pockets. His smile was like sunlight piercing through Cassius’s darkness.

Cassius’s breath caught.

In the room, Evadne whispered to Thaddeus.

Chasel had said familiar stories might wake him.

She wouldn’t give up.

"Wake up," she begged, tears welling. "I’ll tell you a secret. I’ll tell you anything."

She took his hand and wrote three words on his palm.

Her tears fell.

Then—his fingers twitched.

Her heart leaped. "Thaddeus?"

His voice was weak but clear. "Evadne."

She gasped. "I’m here!"

Slowly, he opened his eyes and intertwined their fingers.

"What did you write?" he whispered.

Evadne’s face burned.

"Say it," he urged.

She leaned close, voice trembling. "I love you."

Tears filled his eyes.

He pulled her into his arms, holding her tight. "I thought I’d never hear that again."

She curled against him. "You had it once and threw it away."

"All my fault," he choked out.

She smiled softly. "I forgive you."

Unnoticed, his tears fell.
###Chapter 422

In just under two weeks, Thaddeus had gone from the brink of death to fully conscious.

Most wouldn't have survived the emergency room. Even if they had, recovery would have taken months. According to Chasel, Thaddeus' military training and natural resilience played a crucial role in his rapid healing.

The next morning, Evadne accompanied Thaddeus for a thorough medical checkup.

He obeyed every instruction without protest, like a child being led by his mother.

"Have you ever seen Evadne like this?" Elvis muttered, watching her tuck a blanket around Thaddeus in the wheelchair. "So nurturing. I almost want to salute her."

"Face it," Jareth smirked. "Now that she's found her man, we're as relevant as old toys in the attic."

Elvis scowled. "I practically raised her! I made her toys, tied her shoes, took the blame for her messes! And this guy just waltzes in and steals her?"

"Because she loves him," Jareth yawned. "Get used to it. After everything they've been through, nothing's tearing them apart."

Cassius and Chasel approached, bathed in morning light.

"Elvis, you're not a child," Cassius chided. "Accept that Thaddeus is family now."

Chasel nodded. "Unless Evadne never marries, he's your only brother-in-law."

Elvis huffed. "Fine! But when he marries into the Ashbourne family, I'm making him cook, clean, and take my surname!"

Jareth grinned. "Don't stop there. Make him massage your feet too."

Evadne wheeled Thaddeus over, eyeing them suspiciously. "What are you plotting?"

"Nothing," Elvis grumbled. "Just discussing your beloved's future chores."

Cassius sighed. "Elvis, enough."

Evadne shook her head. "If your future wife even glances at another man, will you sulk for days?"

"Days? I'll make her bedridden for a week!"

The others groaned.

Thaddeus chuckled. Once, he might have been jealous. Now, he understood—this was their way of loving Evadne. He’d adapt.

Darey and Debby arrived, hand in hand like newlyweds.

"Glad to see everyone safe," Debby smiled, relieved at Thaddeus' recovery. "How are you feeling?"

"Better," Thaddeus replied. "I plan to leave tomorrow."

"Absolutely not!" Evadne squeezed his shoulder. "You need at least another week."

Thaddeus covered her hand gently. "Eden's hiding in Elmsworth. Ward needs interrogating. Every second counts."

His urgency was palpable. Their connection, though subtle, was undeniable.

"You can't rush this," Darcy said firmly. "Revenge can wait. Heal first."

Thaddeus nodded gratefully. "Thank you for the blood transfusion. I owe you."

"Call me Darcy. We're family now."

Thaddeus smiled. "Alright, Darcy."

Evadne blushed. Elvis rolled his eyes. "Smooth, Abernathy."

Cassius intervened. "We've arranged for you to stay at Ashbourne Medical. It's discreet, fully equipped. The jet has emergency facilities. You'll be safe."

Chasel puffed his chest. "And you've got me, a world-class doctor."

Jareth smirked. "More renowned than Evadne?"

Chasel froze. "Wait—Evadne is Dr. Eve?"

The others nodded. Chasel turned away, mortified.

The next day, they boarded the Ashbourne private jet.

Debby and Darcy couldn’t join—political duties called. Elvis stayed behind as backup.

In the air, Chasel dozed. The others strategized.

"Thaddeus," Evadne finally asked, "who's backing Eden?"

He hesitated. "Will you believe me?"

"Avery?"

Thaddeus stiffened. "How did you know?"

"Debby and Darcy suspect him too. He's had shady ties to Country T."

Jareth cursed. "That snake!"

Cassius' gaze darkened. "Avery and I have clashed before. Privately."

Evadne was stunned.

"I warned him to stay away from you," Thaddeus admitted. "He’s vindictive. No boundaries."

Cassius nodded. "I couldn’t risk your happiness with someone like that."

Evadne’s eyes welled. "Cassius..."

"Why didn’t you tell me sooner?" Cassius asked Thaddeus.

"Without proof, it was just suspicion. And..." Thaddeus glanced at Evadne. "He was your friend."

Her heart ached. All their past fights over Avery—now so foolish.

"You idiot," she whispered.

He smiled sheepishly. "I’ll do better."

As the jet soared, they leaned together, hands entwined.

Then Thaddeus noticed—her left pinky was stiff.

"Evadne," he frowned, "what happened?"

She tensed.

Should she tell him?

That she was the girl from Zenithia?

The one who dragged him to safety—and lost her finger in the process?
###Chapter 423

After a brief internal conflict, Isabella made her choice—silence.

Nathaniel was drowning in guilt and remorse. She did want to see him suffer for his past mistakes, but his relentless efforts to make amends—risking his life, giving everything to repay his debt—had been more than enough.

She still wanted him to shine in her life like a star. She refused to burden him with more guilt.

This was her quiet way of loving someone.

"Isabella? Are you really okay?" Nathaniel noticed her pale complexion, his chest tightening. His warm hand gently squeezed her shoulder.

"I'm fine."

She lifted her face and flashed him a bright smile. "What could possibly be wrong with me? I scraped my finger climbing a tree as a kid. It's nothing, doesn’t affect my life."

Despite her reassurance, he couldn’t shake his worry. He cradled her pinky delicately. "You have so many brothers. How did they let this happen?"

"My brothers take great care of me! But what can they do when I’m a wild child who refuses to be tamed?" Isabella pouted playfully, her coquettish charm making his pulse quicken. He couldn’t resist stealing a kiss from her tempting lips.

"From now on, you won’t need them. I’ll take care of you. Protect you."

His words sent heat rushing to her cheeks. His breath hitched at her reaction, his gaze darkening with desire.

"Ah! Speaking of which—" Isabella quickly pulled a small, elegant box from her coat pocket and handed it to him. "Here. A gift from Sebastian."

"From your brother?" Nathaniel was stunned.

She nodded shyly, cheeks flushing. "Yes. You were unconscious when he gave it to me. I thought it’d be better to wait until you woke up."

She valued presentation, so she’d chosen a sleek black velvet jewelry box for the gift.

Nathaniel’s throat tightened with emotion. He hadn’t received a gift in years.

Once, only Isabella remembered anniversaries and holidays. Only she cared. But he’d been blind to his blessings back then. He’d had someone who loved him unconditionally, yet he’d seen her as a burden, always trying to escape.

"Open it," she urged, leaning against him.

Nathaniel lifted the lid, his eyes widening at the sight of the cross pendant—the very one Sebastian always wore.

"Isn’t this your brother’s most treasured possession? He’s giving it to me?"

"Huh? He never shows it to anyone. How do you know he keeps it close?" Isabella caught the crucial detail.

Nathaniel gave a bitter smile.

When Sebastian had stormed into that meeting room and fought him, the pendant had slipped from his shirt. The intricate craftsmanship had caught his eye, and the unforgettable scene had left a lasting impression.

"It’s beautiful. Exquisite. I love it."

"It’s not expensive, but it means everything to him. Giving it to you is his way of accepting you." Isabella’s eyes sparkled as she watched him, sensing his genuine appreciation.

After all the twists and turns, she felt lucky the man she loved was still by her side.

What thrilled her more was that Nathaniel had managed to change her brothers’ opinions of him. She’d once thought they’d never forgive him, but thankfully, things were moving in the right direction.

Her only concern now was Reginald. He was a loving father but a hard man to win over—especially for someone already on his bad side like Nathaniel. But that was fine. They’d take it slow.

As long as their hearts were in sync, nothing could keep them apart.

Isabella fastened the pendant around Nathaniel’s neck, her slender fingers brushing against his firm chest.

His muscular physique was dangerously tempting. Just touching him sent her imagination spiraling.

"How should I thank him?" Nathaniel asked, his grip tightening around her waist.

His heart ached. When he used to hold her, he’d loved the softness of her waist. But now, he could feel how much thinner she’d become.

She must have barely eaten or slept while he was unconscious.

"You don’t need to—mmph!"

Before she could finish, Nathaniel pulled her into a crushing embrace.

The rest of her words were swallowed by his searing kiss, his tongue exploring every inch of her mouth.

When he finally pulled away, her lips were swollen, her eyes dazed. He smirked, his voice rough with desire. "Isabella, you taste so sweet."

She was dizzy, her ears burning. She gripped his shoulders. "Don’t get carried away. We’re not alone."

"They’re all asleep. Nothing to worry about."

Suddenly, his grip tightened, his lips grazing her ear as his breathing grew heavier. "I’ll be gentle."

Gentle? What was this man planning? Isabella’s body flushed with heat, but before she could react, Nathaniel’s lips claimed hers again, pressing her down onto the seat.

Oliver was sound asleep, nearly drooling, when he jolted awake as if from a nightmare. He would’ve tumbled from his seat if not for Sebastian’s quick reflexes.

"Ugh, how long was I out?" Oliver rubbed his bleary eyes.

"Three hours."

Sebastian studied his dazed expression, brow quirking. "Bad dream?"

"Yeah. You were yelling at me. Scared me awake." Oliver stretched lazily.

"Is it so hard for you to be serious?" Sebastian’s tone turned stern.

"As a doctor, I’m very serious. But every time I see you, it’s impossible." Oliver suddenly leaned in, his fox-like eyes glinting. "So whose fault is that, really?"

"Stop twisting words." Sebastian looked away, a faint smile tugging at his lips.

"Are you just realizing this? I’m as unreasonable as any woman." Oliver smirked.

"No need to generalize. The only difference between you and women is biology." Sebastian teased dryly. "If you were a woman, you’d be adorable."

"Am I not adorable now?" Oliver batted his lashes dramatically.

"Pathetic. Unlovable Oliver."

"Damn it!" Oliver exploded. "I could fill the ocean with the number of people who want me!"

"Thank you for helping Nathaniel."

Oliver blinked, caught off guard.

"Thanks to you, Nathaniel recovered." Sebastian took a deep breath. "You saved him, which means you saved Isabella. Not just Nathaniel—I owe you too."

"Ugh, don’t remind me." Oliver scowled. "Why didn’t you let Isabella, a world-class surgeon, operate on her own boyfriend? Instead, you dragged me here to embarrass myself in front of my idol! And you all kept it a secret! Was I just some joke to you? Did you ever consider my dignity?"

The memory of those days—living alongside his idol yet acting so casually—filled him with regret.

Watching Oliver’s dramatic rant, so reminiscent of Isabella’s fiery temper, Sebastian couldn’t help but chuckle. "I never meant to mock you. I brought you because I truly believe your skills rival hers. You just specialize differently."

Had he just… praised him? The usually stoic man had actually complimented him. Oliver bit his lip, flushing.

"Regardless, I owe you. I’ll repay you somehow."

"How? In kind?" Oliver arched a brow, eyes glinting mischievously.

"Oliver Bright." Sebastian scolded, though his tone held a hint of amusement.

Suddenly, Oliver straddled him, their faces inches apart. Sebastian’s pulse stuttered.

Their breaths mingled, Oliver’s gaze dripping with playful seduction, like a mischievous Ragdoll cat.

"You said you owe me, right?"

Before Sebastian could react, Oliver wrapped his arms around his neck, lips brushing close. "I want a kiss. Then we’re even."

Sebastian barely had time to process before Oliver’s lips crashed against his, tongue sliding in with practiced ease. High above the clouds, the jet soared as Sebastian lost himself in the moment, his hand instinctively gripping Oliver’s waist. Outside the window, fireworks of sunlight burst through the clouds, painting the sky in gold.

Five hours later, their private jet landed smoothly in Elmsworth. Medical staff Sebastian had arranged waited to escort Nathaniel to the hospital.

"No need. I’m fine," Nathaniel refused instantly.

"How could you?" Isabella’s eyes reddened. "You promised to go. Liar!"

Nathaniel sighed, pulling her close. "Isabella, I’m sorry. Hit me, scold me, but don’t shut me out."

"I’m not talking to you! Liar!" She turned away, pouting in his arms.

Sebastian and Oliver watched, amused, as if observing two bickering children.

Seeing her genuine anger, Nathaniel grew serious. "Isabella, right now, interrogating Vincent is crucial."

Her expression darkened at the name.

"Elspeth doesn’t know we’ve brought Vincent back. That gives us time to strategize. We need his confession—proof Elspeth hired him to kill Erica."

"But will he talk?" Isabella frowned. "Murder is a capital offense. Confessing won’t lessen his sentence. If he wants revenge, he’ll gladly be Elspeth’s scapegoat."

The group’s mood soured. She was right—Vincent was ruthless. They couldn’t rely on his conscience.

"So what do we do? Is there really no way to handle that monster?" Preston fumed.

After a pause, Nathaniel’s lips curved. "In that case, maybe we should let Elspeth know we have Vincent."

Isabella, sharp as ever, instantly grasped his plan. She threw her arms around him, her curves pressing against his chest as she grinned. "Wow, you’re evil. I wasn’t wrong to call you a scoundrel, was I?"

Nathaniel’s eyes darkened at her closeness, his voice rough. "Next time you praise me, be less subtle."

The other three groaned. This couple’s PDA was relentless.

"Ahem. Well, you handle Vincent. I’m out." Preston waved as he walked off. "Gotta get home to my wife. Good luck!"

With that, he was gone, leaving the others speechless.

"By the way," Oliver mused, nudging Sebastian, "the Bright family owns a top-tier hospital. Our neurology department’s excellent. Maybe Mr. Kingsley should swing by? Mention my name for a discount."

Sebastian, tall and unreadable, merely gave him a look, indulging his antics.

Isabella and Nathaniel nodded eagerly. "Sounds perfect!"
###Chapter 424

Nathaniel bid everyone farewell, his strides urgent as he headed straight home.

He'd been suppressing his emotions these past days, too proud to let his vulnerability show. Alone, he'd wrapped himself in blankets, scrolling through intimate photos of him and Isabella, his eyes burning with unshed tears.

Being away from his beloved wife was torture. His appetite vanished. Sleep eluded him. He was at his breaking point. Seeing Harrison and Seraphina flirt earlier had only stoked the fire of his longing, making it unbearable.

Night draped the sky in stars.

Elmsworth bloomed quickly in Nathaniel's absence. The garden burst with early signs of spring.

Five days without news from the young master. Olivia was sick with worry, her mind elsewhere, barely eating or sleeping. Every day, she did two things.

She cared for Isabella. And waited for Nathaniel to return.

Tonight, Olivia stood immaculately dressed by the door as usual.

She felt certain the young master would return victorious any moment. Maybe today. If not today, then surely tomorrow.

Suddenly, a white sports car streaked toward her like lightning.

It screeched to a halt before her. When Nathaniel emerged unharmed, striding toward her, Olivia trembled, clenching her fists to steady herself.

"Mr. Kingsley, you're finally back."

"Why are you standing out here alone?"

Nathaniel's eyes widened in surprise. "Have you been waiting here every night?"

"No," she lied smoothly. "I just couldn't sleep tonight. Came out for fresh air. By coincidence, you returned."

Her feelings for Nathaniel ran deep, but she never let them surface.

"Is Isabella asleep?" he asked anxiously.

"Yes, she just drifted off."

Nathaniel's shoulders slumped, disappointment flashing in his eyes. "Damn it. I raced home, nearly burned out my engine, and still missed her."

He knew his wife adored sleep. A true sleeping beauty.

In the past, if he hadn't kept her awake with his affections, she would've been asleep by now. And they'd have to wait till morning for... other activities.

Olivia forced a smile. "At least you won't have to stare at Ms. Isabella's photos anymore, tormented by longing."

True.

But desire still burned in him. His wife was asleep—what was he supposed to do? Take a cold shower and handle it himself?

Life was cruel.

As Nathaniel stepped inside, the dim light revealed a scab on Olivia's left cheek. A sharp cut.

Her left cheek was noticeably swollen.

"Wait." He frowned. "What happened to your face?"

"Nothing, Mr. Kingsley." She lowered her gaze.

"Nothing? You've clearly been struck. Do you think I'm blind?"

Rage ignited in his eyes, his voice icy. "Who did this? Who dared touch my people while I was gone? I'll skin them alive!"

Olivia knew she couldn't hide it. "This afternoon... Miss Arabella came. She wanted to see Ms. Isabella."

Nathaniel's heart skipped. "What did Arabella want?"

"She said she and Ms. Isabella were middle school classmates, close back then. She’s reflected on past mistakes and wanted to make amends."

"Do you believe her?" Nathaniel scoffed.

"I didn’t let her in."

"So she hit you because you refused?"

Olivia stayed silent.

"Ha. Her 'apology' was pure bullshit."

Nathaniel exhaled sharply, reining in his fury. "Arabella came with ulterior motives. Playing both sides. Does she think she's a saint?"

Olivia sighed.

"You're caught in our sibling rivalry while caring for Isabella. I'm sorry." Guilt laced his voice. "Take leave starting tomorrow. I'll handle Isabella. You love traveling, right? Take my credit card. Go enjoy yourself."

"You're too kind. I'm just doing my job."

Her face remained calm, but warmth spread through her chest.

Nathaniel tiptoed into the bedroom.

He moved silently, afraid to wake Isabella. No lights. No shoes. Like a thief in the night.

Moonlight cast shadows on the wall, familiar and comforting. He stood over her petite form, gazing down before pressing a featherlight kiss to her lips.

I'm back, darling. Sleep well. I'll be here when you wake.

As he turned to leave, slender arms wrapped tightly around his waist.

"Isabella." His heart lurched.

Tears welled in her eyes as she clung to him. "Nathaniel, you're finally back. Why were you gone so long? I thought you weren't coming home. That you didn't want me anymore."

Her tears soaked his shirt, piercing his heart.

She hadn’t been asleep at all.

Unsure if this was reality or a dream.

Nathaniel turned, crushing her against him. One hand cradled her head, fingers threading through her hair. He wished he could fuse her into his very being.

"Silly girl. I'd rather the world forsake me, become everyone's enemy—but I’d never leave you. You're my everything."

"But you were gone so long. You've never left me like this before."

Her small fists crumpled his crisp shirt.

"Catching a criminal isn't easy. They're slippery. Took a few extra days." His tone softened, soothing.

"Did you catch him?"

"With my own two hands." Pride colored his voice.

"Wow, Nathaniel! You're amazing!" Her eyes sparkled.

"I have to be, don’t I? To protect you." He grinned shamelessly.

"Now that he's caught... can Erica get justice?"

Nathaniel exhaled. "Yes. Your kindhearted friend can finally rest in peace."

Isabella clasped her hands, whispering a prayer for Erica. For the first time in days, a small smile touched her lips.

If she wasn’t sleeping, Nathaniel wouldn’t let her off easy.

Without bothering to shower, he stripped while kissing her, pushing her onto the bed.

Her nightgown hit the floor. Her legs trembled under his touch.

Moonlight bathed the room in silver, heavy breaths and soft moans filling the air.

Afterward, too spent to move, they fell asleep tangled in each other, skin damp with sweat.

"Darling, I'm sorry for making you wait." Guilt weighed on him. As someone with autism, Isabella needed his presence—but work often pulled him away.

She nuzzled his chest. "It doesn’t matter. I have everything I need with you."

Nathaniel tilted her chin up, gaze intense. "I want to give you more than just myself. The entire Kingsley Group as your gift."

She drifted off before fully processing his words.

Holding her close, he vowed to give her the world. Taking over Kingsley Group wasn’t just about revenge—it was about securing their future.

Meanwhile, Harrison had just moved into Seraphina’s villa. Hours tangled together left them exhausted.

Seraphina collapsed into sleep, still in her clothes.

Harrison carefully changed her into pajamas, chuckling when she mumbled about food in her dreams.

"Little glutton. I'll feed you when you wake." He kissed her forehead before leaving.

The next morning, Margaret was overjoyed to see Harrison and Mrs. Lockwood return.

"You kept the house perfect, Margaret. Thank you." Harrison’s arm curled around Seraphina’s waist.

The doorbell rang. Preston entered with two massive food containers from a famed restaurant. Despite the three-hour wait, he’d secured their favorites.

The aroma made Seraphina’s mouth water. They sat together—master and servant blurred into family—enjoying the meal.

After dinner, Seraphina and Margaret cleaned up while Preston pulled Harrison aside.

"Mr. Lockwood, while you were away... there were developments at Abernathy Group." His voice lowered.

"Did the Aether Dynamics deal fall through?"

Harrison had been unconscious, then recovering. Seraphina confiscated his phone, shielding him from stress. He’d been cut off from updates.

"No. It’s progressing smoothly."

"That’s good, isn’t it?"

Preston’s expression darkened. "The one pushing it isn’t Mr. Reginald. It’s his eldest son."

"My brother?" Harrison’s eyes narrowed.

"Yes. You missed the meeting. Mr. Sebastian stepped in to negotiate with the chairman."

Preston’s tone turned critical. "He’s always lived abroad, showing zero interest in Abernathy Group. Now he swoops in at this crucial moment? Too convenient. It’s like he’s exploiting the situation—stealing your role!"

"Preston, don’t say that." Harrison’s voice turned stern. "Sebastian saved my life. He risked everything rescuing me from those kidnappers, even catching a severe illness. If not for that, I wouldn’t be the heir."
###Chapter 425

That kidnapping incident remained a dark stain on the Sinclair family's history.

Back then, the Sinclair brothers had been abducted by a notorious criminal syndicate and held in a derelict warehouse deep in the woods—infested with rats and roaches. The kidnappers demanded an exorbitant ransom from the Sinclair patriarch.

Alexander couldn't recall how many days he'd been trapped there. The place was filthy, damp, and reeked of decay. He couldn't even see the sun rise or set.

As a child, he endured daily beatings and starvation. The kidnappers, fearing escape, only fed them once every three days. It was hell.

Then, his older brother, Sebastian—four years his senior—managed to distract their captors during a moment of carelessness. It gave Alexander the slimmest chance to run.

He stumbled through the woods, running blindly, never looking back. Eventually, he collapsed from exhaustion and tumbled down a steep slope.

Miraculously, a hunter tracking deer found him. Once conscious, Alexander immediately contacted the authorities, leading them to the kidnappers' hideout and reuniting with his family.

Sebastian wasn't as fortunate.

Enraged by the failed escape, the kidnappers beat him savagely and locked him in a cramped shipping container—without food or water—for five agonizing days. Sebastian survived by drinking his own urine.

Three days after receiving the ransom, the kidnappers stripped him naked, tied him up, and dumped him at the gates of Windsor Estates before vanishing in broad daylight.

The abuse and prolonged confinement left Sebastian with severe internal damage. His medical bills alone exceeded fifty thousand dollars daily.

For years, Sebastian teetered on the brink of death, sustained only by the Sinclair fortune.

The trauma scarred the family irreparably.

That was why Alexander always felt he owed Sebastian an unpayable debt.

And why Reginald, their strict and unforgiving father, showed blatant favoritism toward Sebastian while harboring resentment toward Alexander.

"But you're the heir now. He shouldn't interfere."

Nathaniel was furious. "You held back last time, and the board already questions your leadership. He took advantage, made decisions in your stead, even secured a partnership. Now half the company supports him, and Reginald's been in constant contact with him lately. Mr. Alexander, I know you value loyalty, but we Sinclairs aren't the Vanderbilts. Blood means nothing when power's at stake! You know better than anyone what you've sacrificed these years! Even if Sebastian saved you, even if he's been kind—he's still the eldest son. After all this time, can you honestly say he has no ulterior motives? That he doesn't want Sinclair Holdings?"

Nathaniel was practically spitting fire in his frustration.

Alexander's breath hitched, his gaze darkening.

"And one more thing—doesn't it strike you as odd?"

Nathaniel pressed on, sharp as a blade. "He claims to be above worldly affairs, yet he knew every detail of our deal with J Group. What does that tell us? That he's been watching you—watching the company—all these years! And during that meeting, he was seated right beside J Group's chairman on the video call. It was planned. He orchestrated it!"

Alexander remained silent, his expression unreadable.

"Mr. Alexander, you need to be careful. A thief in the family is worse than an open enemy. If you're not vigilant, you won't see the knife until it's in your back!"

"Nathaniel." Alexander's voice was barely steady. "If—just if—Sebastian recovers and returns from abroad, if he wants to reclaim the company and his position as CEO... what should I do? Should I just hand over everything I've built?"

"Why should he get it just because he wants it? On what grounds?"

Nathaniel's fists clenched in outrage. "Without you, Sinclair Holdings wouldn't be where it is today! You've bled for this company, nearly worked yourself to death inspecting construction sites! You haven't even tasted the fruits of your labor, and he thinks he can waltz back in and take it? Why? Because Reginald backs him? You have William's support—we're not at a disadvantage! No matter how capable a son is, he still answers to his father!"

"What 'son and father' nonsense are you spouting?"

Isabella's sweet voice drifted in before she entered the room.

Alexander shot Nathaniel a warning glance, then forced a warm smile.

Isabella carried a tray with two teacups. "What were you two discussing so intensely? Mr. Nathaniel, you look positively livid."

"Nothing important. He gets riled up over stray dogs fighting in the street. Youthful temper."

Alexander rose to take the tray from her, his voice dropping to a husky murmur. "Why the formality? Treating me like a guest now?"

"Just worried you'd get thirsty from all that talking." Isabella smirked.

"A kiss would quench me better than any drink."

He pulled her close, kissing her deeply, uncaring of their audience.

Nathaniel flushed and averted his gaze.

Isabella's heart pounded like a trapped bird. When Alexander tried to deepen the kiss, she gently pushed him away. "I came to discuss something serious. Can you focus?"

"Isabella, you're too tempting."

His eyes burned with restrained desire. "Around you, I can't pretend to be a gentleman."

She didn't dare meet his gaze, afraid she'd melt under its intensity.

They settled on the sofa, Alexander draping an arm around her shoulders as she instinctively leaned into him. The picture of perfect harmony.

Nathaniel nearly teared up. He never thought he'd live to see this reconciliation. Worth every second.

"Adrian called. They're starting Ward's trial today." Isabella clenched her fists.

"Lucas and I have had people watching every exit—airports, train stations, docks. Still no sign of Eden." Alexander enveloped her small hand in his, warming her chilled fingers.

"Someone's protecting him. Otherwise, with our reach, we'd have turned New York inside out. That bastard wouldn't stay hidden." Their eyes met, both knowing exactly who that someone was.

"No matter where Eden's hiding in this city, he won't escape. His protector won't change that." Alexander's gaze sharpened like a blade.

"We need to watch Avery too."

Isabella's mind raced. "If he's truly allied with Eden, he won't let him stay here. The moment Eden's captured and talks, Avery's exposed. He'll be desperate."

"You think Avery might silence him permanently?" Alexander's grip tightened.

Her breath hitched. "I hope not. Eden was a mercenary, ex-royal guard. He's not easy to kill. And he wouldn't come to New York alone. Even if Avery tried, it wouldn't be simple, right?"

Despite her words, Alexander's suspicion deepened her unease.

Sensing it, he laced their fingers together, voice softening. "Our enemies are strong, but it's okay if we can't take them all at once. At least we're not blind anymore. That's progress. For now, we focus on Elspeth—for Erica, for my mother, for justice."

Mentioning his mother, his voice cracked, eyes reddening. But for Isabella, he stayed strong—her anchor, her safe harbor.

Her chest ached. Trembling slightly, she pulled him into an embrace.

He held her back instantly, as if he'd been waiting for it.

"You don't have to say anything. I understand."

That night, in the police interrogation room.

Adrian and his team from Major Crimes had grilled Ward for ten exhausting hours.

Their seasoned tactics were useless against this mentally unshakable, shameless monster.

Threats, promises of leniency—nothing made Ward confess who pulled the strings.

At an impasse, Isabella and Alexander rushed to the station late that night.

"Isabella, I'm sorry."

Adrian raked a hand through his hair, frustration etching his handsome face. "I'm useless. I can't break him."

If Ward kept stalling, even if convicted, they'd have no direct evidence against Elspeth. The trail would go cold.

Worse—Ward was a citizen of Country T. By law, foreigners couldn't receive the death penalty here. Maximum sentence: 20 years.

After that, he'd be deported—where Country T's courts would resentence him.

The thought of this monster escaping execution made Adrian's teeth grind. "Just thinking about it feels like being fried alive, Isabella!"

"Don't say that. You're doing everything you can. Ward's just a demon."

She took a steadying breath, eyes sharpening. "Adrian, can you arrange for Alexander and me to see Ward?"

"You two?" He blinked in shock.

"Yes. Let us talk to him. It might help."
###Chapter 426

Aaron dramatically wiped his forehead, his eyes gleaming with excitement. "Isabella, you've helped us crack two murder cases before. In one, you found the crucial piece of evidence that broke the case wide open. In the other, you spotted a flaw in the suspect's alibi that led to a full confession!"

Nathaniel was stunned, his wide eyes fixed on the composed woman beside him.

This was it. He was done for.

How could Isabella be this extraordinary? No matter how hard he tried, he just couldn’t keep up.

Before, Nathaniel had considered himself decent, maybe even exceptional.

Now, standing next to Isabella, he felt as insignificant as a discarded tissue in a public restroom.

"Hut, I'm surprised you remember my shining moments, Aaron," Isabella teased, her eyes twinkling. "If it weren't for Alexander and Vanessa blocking my path, I might’ve joined the police academy and become a gun-toting officer by now. You’d probably be calling me 'Sergeant Sinclair' today."

"That’s because you’re our most precious gem," Aaron chuckled nervously, catching himself before he revealed too much. "We couldn’t risk you getting hurt playing with guns and knives. So, in the end, we stopped you."

Isabella arched a brow, and Aaron quickly clamped his mouth shut, nearly letting the truth slip.

With that, Aaron confidently led them to meet the Chief.

The Chief immediately recognized the sharp-witted young woman who had assisted in solving major cases with her keen observations.

What surprised him more was seeing Mr. Kingsley by her side!

The Kingsley Group, Nathaniel Kingsley—these names carried immense weight in Elmsworth!

"Mr. Kingsley! I didn’t expect you to come in person. My apologies for not greeting you earlier."

While meeting Isabella was a pleasure, seeing Nathaniel was an outright delight. The Chief went beyond pleasantries, even ordering Aaron, the head of the detective squad, to pour tea for Nathaniel!

Aaron blinked in disbelief. Nathaniel immediately stood. "I’ll do it myself!"

Letting his future brother-in-law serve him tea in front of Isabella? Was he out of his mind?

He still wanted to marry the Sinclair family’s daughter!

Aaron smirked, impressed by Nathaniel’s understanding of social etiquette.

"Oh no, no, how could I let you do that? Allow me!" The Chief personally served the tea, a move that made Aaron roll his eyes.

If this man knew the "Aaron" he’d been ordering around for years was the son of Skyrim’s wealthiest man, would he offer him his own office chair?

Nathaniel didn’t drink immediately. He tested the cup’s temperature, blew on it gently, then handed it to Isabella.

"It’s not too hot now. You can drink."

Aaron and the Chief gaped.

"Thank you. You should have some too." Isabella took a sip before passing it back.

Nathaniel accepted the cup, drinking from the exact spot her lips had touched.

The sweetness between them was enough to make the others envious.

"Chief, we came for one reason—to see Ward and speak with him."

Before the Sinclair siblings could speak, Nathaniel’s starry eyes turned serious, cutting straight to the point.

"Aaron, Mr. Kingsley wants to see him. Arrange it immediately," the Chief ordered.

The three of them froze.

That was it?

"Yes, sir." Aaron was just as shocked at how smoothly things were going.

"But Ward is extremely dangerous. It’s not safe for you to meet him alone. Let Aaron accompany you—"

"No need," Nathaniel declined calmly.

"It’s fine. Mr. Kingsley’s skills surpass even Ward’s and Captain Sinclair’s," Isabella said, tilting her head toward Nathaniel with a smile as sweet as pearls. "When he gets stubborn, you’d better have extra guards ready. I’m afraid Ward might not survive jail otherwise."

Aaron and two officers waited outside while Isabella and Nathaniel confronted Ward.

After a tense wait, Ward, clad in prison garb and shackles, was escorted in.

"Well, well, look who it is."

Ward smirked, lounging on the steel chair as his lecherous gaze raked over Isabella. "What’s the matter, Ms. Sinclair? Miss me?"

Isabella remained cold and composed, but Nathaniel’s fury was already at its peak. His jaw clenched, eyes burning with unrestrained rage. The beast inside him was ready to break free!

Seeing Nathaniel’s anger only amused Ward further. He threw his head back and laughed behind the iron bars.

Just then, Isabella firmly grasped Nathaniel’s trembling hand beneath the table.

Her warmth seeped into him, steadying his turbulent emotions.

"Get to the point. I need my beauty sleep," Ward sneered, clearly prepared to fight them to the end.

"Ward, we’re here to discuss a collaboration," Isabella began smoothly.

"A collaboration?" Ward barked a laugh. "Ms. Sinclair, do you think I’m a child? I nearly killed both of you, and now you want to work with me? That’s hilarious!"

"Yes, you tried. And failed," Isabella countered, her smile razor-thin.

Ward’s smirk faltered.

As a former mercenary, her words were a direct insult to his professionalism.

"You know our laws. Even foreign criminals serve no more than twenty years. But do you really want to rot here for two decades? By the time you’re shipped back to Country T at sixty, do you think your connections will still protect you? You know the conditions there. Do you think you’ll survive?"

Every word struck like a blade, leaving no room for deflection.

A born negotiator.

Nathaniel squeezed her hand, his gaze filled with admiration.

Ward’s smirk vanished.

Seizing the moment, Isabella narrowed her eyes. "We know Elspeth orchestrated this. Without her, none of this would’ve happened. Our real enemy isn’t you—it’s her."

"While you’re locked up, she’s living comfortably as the darling of the Kingsley Group, acting like your suffering has nothing to do with her. Can you really accept that?"

Ward let out a cold chuckle but stayed silent.

"Cooperate with us. Testify against Elspeth for Erica’s murder, and we’ll ensure you return to Country T within a year. My sister has ties to the royal family. With her influence, you might not even serve two years before walking free."

Her smile was sweet, but her words were lethal. "What do you say, Mr. Ward? Care to reconsider?"

Nathaniel’s eyes shone with awe.

In strategy and intellect, Isabella outmatched even the most seasoned businessmen.

Thank God she was on his side.

Otherwise, he’d have been outmaneuvered long ago.

Ward scoffed. "If this offer came from anyone else, I might’ve considered it. But from you, Ms. Sinclair? Not a shred of credibility."

"My current predicament is thanks to you. Now you need my testimony to take down Elspeth, using me as your pawn. Do you think I’m blind to your games?"

He stood abruptly, the chair screeching against the floor.

"Don’t waste your breath. Use this time to figure out how to beat Elspeth on your own."

When Isabella and Nathaniel left, their expressions were grim.

Aaron didn’t pry. Seeing the failed negotiation, he reassured them he’d push for Ward’s trial.

Back in the car, Nathaniel pulled Isabella close, his jaw resting gently on her head as he comforted her.

"Isabella, don’t lose heart. Even without Ward’s testimony, we have Erica’s recording. It’s not direct evidence, but after twenty years, exposing it will devastate Elspeth. She’ll be ruined, and Frederic won’t protect her anymore."

"Nathaniel, is that all you want?" Isabella’s voice was icy.

His breath hitched, heart aching.

He wanted more.

He wanted Elspeth dead.

"After twenty years, what can a recording really do?" Isabella pressed a hand to his pounding chest, feeling the resentment only she understood. "The statute of limitations is up. All evidence is gone. Without direct proof, we can’t give her a severe sentence. Just disgracing her, making Frederic abandon her—how is that enough? How is that justice?"

"Isabella." His voice was raw with restraint.

"Our only chance to make Elspeth suffer is using Erica’s death and Ward’s testimony to charge her with hiring a hitman!"

Tears brimmed in Isabella’s stormy eyes. "Erica sacrificed her life to uncover the truth about your mother’s murder. This is the opportunity she gave us. We can’t waste it!"

"Do you really think Ward will talk? He seemed defiant."

"He will," Isabella insisted. "I saw hesitation in him. Otherwise, why would he even listen to us? He wouldn’t have agreed to meet."

Nathaniel nodded slowly.

"But right now, he doesn’t trust me. He’s still comfortable. He doesn’t see the need to risk cooperating."

"A comfortable life?" A dangerous glint flashed in Nathaniel’s eyes. "Soon, he’ll realize cooperating is his only chance at survival—even if temporary."
###Chapter 427

The phone in Alexander's hand vibrated sharply. A call from Dominic.

"Mr. Kingsley! Everything's arranged! Tonight at seven, prime time—every major network will broadcast Ward's arrest. I guarantee Isabella will see it!"

"Good."

Alexander's lips curled into a satisfied smirk. "After that, monitor Isabella and the prison closely. If anything changes, contact Evelyn and me immediately."

"Understood, Mr. Kingsley!"

Dominic hesitated, then blurted out, "Congratulations on reconciling with Mrs. Sinclair, sir. Make sure you treat her like the queen she is from now on. Compensate for those lost three years!"

Before Alexander could respond, Dominic cheekily ended the call.

Alexander's brow twitched.

That little brat—daring to hang up on him?

And what was that nonsense about? Lecturing him on how to behave?

Evelyn cleared her throat, cheeks flushed. "I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but your assistant's voice is louder than a foghorn."

"I have no secrets from you. You're welcome to know everything."

Alexander's voice dropped to a husky murmur, laced with indulgence. "Next time, I'll put him on speaker so he can apologize directly to you, Mrs. Sinclair."

"Don't you dare. A little privacy is healthy!"

Evelyn's eyes sparkled with defiance. "And who's this Mrs. Sinclair you're referring to? All I have is a divorce decree—no marriage certificate in sight."

"Who else but the dazzling Ms. Ashbourne?"

Alexander captured her hand, pressing a lingering kiss to her knuckles. His gaze burned with tenderness. "If you'll have me, I'll spend a lifetime making you happy."

"Hmph. As if I care."

Evelyn's delicate fingers trembled in his grasp, her pulse fluttering wildly. Even the tips of her ears turned pink.

Alexander's eyes darkened with hunger. Mere touch wasn't enough. He claimed her lips in a searing kiss, savoring her sweetness like a man starved.

Evelyn wasn't one to lose herself to desire—yet with him, every nerve ignited. Her vision blurred, her body melted, and coherent thought evaporated.

When Alexander's hand slid beneath her dress, she gasped and grabbed his wrist. "You had Dominic leak Ward's arrest to provoke Isabella, didn't you?"

"Clever girl." His thumb traced circles on her inner thigh.

"And you're certain she'll take the bait? What if she stays calm?" Evelyn's voice hitched as his touch sent shivers up her spine.

"We cover every angle. You taught me that, Evelyn." His voice was rough velvet.

"Then let me fan the flames."

Her fingertip traced his jaw, a sly smile playing on her lips. Alexander recognized that glint—his cunning wife had another scheme.

At seven sharp, every news channel led with the shooting.

Ward's arrest dominated headlines, his face unmistakable in the footage Alexander provided.

Simultaneously, reports of an innocent maid's death sparked public outrage.

Citizens flooded forums, demanding justice.

[This Ward is a monster! Worse than an animal! He deserves the harshest punishment!]

[Finally, the media did right—exposing these beasts for the world to see!]

[That poor girl… gone so young. Heartbreaking.]

Just as public fury peaked, strategic comments surfaced like stones rippling a pond.

[Did you know Ward is Isabella's personal bodyguard? Worked for her for years. The Sinclairs knew.]

Shockwaves spread.

[Word is, he's ex-military from T country. Killed people before.]

[And Isabella whitewashed his record? Typical elite privilege.]

[The victim was her maid. Both served Isabella. Doesn't that seem… convenient?]

Speculations exploded.

[Is Isabella cursed? Everyone around her ends up dead or ruined.]

[Maybe the maid discovered Isabella's dirty secrets, so the witch ordered her silenced?]

The theories grew wilder—some absurd, others chillingly accurate.

"Ms. Ashbourne, the narrative's spreading as planned."

Jason, though still recovering, had mobilized their PR team. "Social media's alight. Isabella must be sweating bullets."

Evelyn was a maestro of public opinion. A few well-placed words, and the mob turned.

"Jason, I hate to burden you while you're healing, but you're our best strategist."

"Don't apologize." His tone softened. "I'll always have your back."

"Jason…" Evelyn's throat tightened.

Lately, her emotions ran closer to the surface. She blamed Alexander for making her soft.

"Besides, I'm bored stiff here. Nydia's cooking is turning me into a couch potato."

Evelyn smirked. "I heard she visits daily. Still bored?"

"She's feeding me into oblivion! My abs are vanishing!" His mock despair couldn't mask his happiness.

"Nydia inherited her mother's culinary genius. You're lucky."

A pause. Then Evelyn turned serious. "Once this settles and you've recovered, I'll speak to Reginald and Eleanor about you and Nydia."

"Us?!" Jason's voice cracked.

Evelyn laughed. "It's early days—you two need time. But know this: Nydia is Ashbourne royalty. They'll vet you thoroughly. I'll put in a good word."

"Ms. Ashbourne… thank you." Emotion thickened his voice.

She waved him off. "You've been loyal to our family. It's only fair. Plus, Nydia deserves happiness. I trust you'll protect her."

"I swear it. I adore her."

Evelyn smiled. "Congratulations to you and Mr. Kingsley. After everything, you've found your way back. I wish you both joy."

"We will be, Jason. All of us will." Her heart swelled with quiet hope.
###Chapter 428

Windermere Estate

The entire Sinclair household, staff included, was glued to their screens, watching the breaking news about Ward. Gasps echoed through the grand halls, whispers spreading like wildfire.

"That's Ward? Mrs. Sinclair's personal assistant?"

"Unbelievable! I knew he was trouble the second I laid eyes on him. Always had that slimy vibe."

"Oh, poor Erica! Such a kind soul, gone just like that..."

Tears welled in the servants' eyes, their quiet sobs filling the air.

"Elspeth is just as much to blame! How could she let a monster like that into this house? Does she think our lives are disposable?" one voice rang out, sharp with fury.

"You think the 'noble' ladies of this house see us as human?" A maid who'd been close to Enca scoffed. "Those two are worse than vipers. Enca suffered under them—called at all hours, bruises hidden under her sleeves. When I asked her about it, she just stayed silent."

"Disgusting! Elspeth and Glynnis are nothing but spoiled brats with foul mouths!"

Nods of agreement rippled through the crowd. The staff had long grown weary of the mother-daughter duo, but the Sinclair name held too much power to defy.

"Back when Mrs. Evadne Sinclair was married to Mr. Thaddeus, things were different. She treated us with respect, stood up for us. Now? If it weren't for the paycheck, I'd rather be scrubbing dumpsters!"

"Then go scrub dumpsters and stop whining!" A shrill voice cut through the murmurs like a blade.

Glynnis stood there, face flushed with rage, her designer heels clicking sharply against the marble as she stormed toward them. "What did you just say? Repeat it to my face!"

Silence.

"Pathetic! All bark, no bite!" Glynnis sneered, her lip curling. "You're nothing but lowborn servants, destined to grovel at our feet. Remember who signs your checks! One more word about Evadne, and I'll have your entire families thrown out of Elmsworth!"

"Since when do we need to grovel?" A young maid shot back, fire in her eyes. "We signed employment contracts, not slavery agreements! We're not your dogs!"

"How dare you?" Glynnis's face twisted, momentarily speechless.

"Mrs. Evadne Sinclair had class—inside and out. A thousand times the woman you'll ever be! You're just a rich brat with no manners. I quit!" The maid ripped off her name tag and hurled it at Glynnis.

"You vile little—!"

Glynnis lunged, her palm cracking against the maid's cheek.

The room erupted. Servants tore off their name tags in unison, a silent rebellion.

Glynnis staggered back, but her arrogance held firm. "You think this scares me? I'll have every last one of you arrested! Without the Sinclair name, you'll starve in the gutters!"

"Glynnis."

A single word, icy and authoritative, froze the room.

Everyone turned.

"Father?" Glynnis paled.

Frederic and Dennis stood behind her, their arrival unnoticed.

"What was that?" Frederic's voice was dangerously calm. "Did you just strike an employee?"

"Father, they insulted me! They disrespected Mother and me! Are you seriously taking their side?"

Frederic ignored her dramatics. "Is this how I raised you? To use your status as a weapon? To forget basic decency?"

Glynnis's chest heaved. "You're blaming me?"

The servants, sensing justice, began to disperse.

Frederic Sinclair, despite his flaws, had always treated his staff with dignity. That was the mark of true nobility—not wealth, but character.

"Windermere Estate runs smoothly because of your hard work. I won't let one incident drive you away. You're invaluable." His gaze shifted to Glynnis. "Apologize. Now."

Her jaw dropped. "You can't be serious!"

"No excuses. You will apologize."

Glynnis's face burned as she gritted out, "I'm... sorry."

The words tasted like ash.

Just then, the servants bowed in unison. "Miss Mari, good day!"

Frederic turned.

Jareth and Mari stood hand in hand, radiating newlywed bliss. Even Frederic couldn't deny the chemistry between them.

The way Jareth looked at Mari—it was the same devotion he'd once had for Cynthia.

"Is that Mr. Fairhaven? With Miss Mari?" The maids buzzed excitedly.

"Perfect match! He's handsome, wealthy, and heir to the Fairhaven Group. No one will dare bully Miss Mari now!"

Frederic's brow twitched at the last remark.

"Father," Mari murmured, her voice soft as always.

"Mr. Sinclair," Jareth greeted smoothly, lifting their joined hands. "Mari missed you. I couldn't say no."

Mari blushed, tucking herself against him.

Glynnis's jealousy burned like acid. She'd given up on Jareth after his public humiliation of her, but seeing her meek sister wrapped in his devotion? Unbearable.

"You look well, Mari," Frederic said, warmth seeping into his tone.

"I am. Jareth takes... excellent care of me." She nearly slipped and called him "honey," catching herself just in time.

Jareth smirked, whispering, "I liked the first version better."

Mari bit her lip, flustered.

"Thank you for looking after her, Jareth," Frederic said, tacitly approving their relationship. A union between the Sinclairs and Fairhavens? Ideal.

"My pleasure. In fact," Jareth's gaze darkened with possessiveness, "I plan to pamper her for the rest of our lives."

Frederic coughed, fighting a smile. Too soon to show full approval—Jareth hadn't even proposed yet.

The staff swooned. A wedding was clearly imminent.

Mari's eyes shimmered. "Jareth..."

"Mr. Sinclair, forgive the interruption," Jareth said smoothly. "But whatever Glynnis did, don't let it ruin your day. Thad mentioned you've been overworking yourself."

Glynnis trembled, her glare at Mari murderous.

Jareth's grip on Mari tightened.

This wasn't over.
###Chapter 429

"Alexander, I appreciate your continued concern for me." A faint smile touched Frederic's lips as he spoke.

"Not just me, Isabella and Sebastian are thinking about you too." Alexander's eyes crinkled into crescents, his words dripping with sweetness. This wasn't just about impressing his future father-in-law—it was also about scoring points for his best friend.

"I haven't seen Isabella in a while. Both of you, follow me to the study. Let's sit and catch up." Frederic's voice softened as he beckoned Isabella closer. "Come here, sweetheart."

As Isabella had grown older, her interactions with her father had lessened. But in her memories, he had always been the one who doted on her the most.

"Daddy." Her doe-like eyes shimmered as she released Alexander's hand and walked toward Frederic.

For some inexplicable reason, Alexander's eyes reddened, a bitter taste rising in his throat. No matter how much he loved her, no matter how devoted he was, he could never replace her family in her heart.

Perhaps in this world, many could live without love—but no one could bear the pain of losing their family, of being torn from their flesh and blood.

When Isabella reached him, Frederic opened his arms, enveloping her petite frame. His large, gentle hand stroked her silky raven hair as he held his long-absent daughter close to his chest.

She pressed her face into his shirt, and suddenly, her heart fluttered. A bitter emotion welled up, and tears trickled down, dampening Frederic's crisp dress shirt.

At that moment, Glynnis' rage finally boiled over. As Frederic's firstborn, she had always been the apple of the Abernathy family's eye. Proud of her intelligence and beauty, her competitive nature had ensured she remained the center of her parents' attention, overshadowing Isabella's existence. But now—Hamilton, Elspeth, and now Alexander. Isabella was stealing everything that had once been hers!

Even Frederic's affection had been stolen.

She was consumed by fury—an unbearable, seething fury.

Meanwhile, Elspeth, confined to the house, had been terrified by the news about Ward and the online rumors. Panic clawed at her, leaving her paralyzed with fear.

Frantically, she found the medication Victor had left her and injected herself twice. Only then did her convulsing nerves finally settle, allowing her to think clearly.

She had never expected Ward, who had fled to Country T, to be caught. Even less had she anticipated that the public outcry over Erica's death would implicate her.

The police hadn't summoned her yet, which meant Ward hadn't given her up. But she couldn't guarantee he wouldn't crack under pressure and reveal everything—how she had hired him to kill Erica. If that happened, it would be too late.

Currently, her movements were restricted by Frederic's house arrest. The only person who could run errands for her was Glynnis.

Glynnis, her eyes swollen from crying, came to see Elspeth, sobbing uncontrollably. But Elspeth had no patience for her daughter's emotional turmoil. She cut straight to the point.

"Ward's been captured. He might expose us. That man—he can't be allowed to live."

"Expose us? What did I do?" Glynnis sniffed, a cold glint in her eyes. "Wasn't it all your doing? Don't drag me into this."

"You ungrateful brat!" Elspeth's voice turned venomous. "You're trying to wash your hands of this now? Your own mother is in trouble, and instead of helping, you just want to hide? If I go down, you won't have a peaceful life either!"

They were far from mother and daughter—they were accomplices in crime.

"What do you want me to do?" Glynnis gritted her teeth, her voice laced with irritation.

Elspeth's expression darkened. "I want Ward dead."

"Dead? He's under police custody! How are we supposed to do that?" Glynnis, hardened by Elspeth's influence, didn't even flinch at the mention of murder. Her first thought was execution.

"Prisons are full of people willing to do dirty work for money. With so many inmates, it's easy to arrange an 'accident.'" Elspeth tossed a bank card toward Glynnis. "There's enough in here to handle it. Get it done quickly. I won't wait long."

Glynnis clutched the card like a blade.

"I'll do it," she said slowly. "But I have one condition."

"You dare bargain with your own mother? Have you no conscience left?" Elspeth sneered, her finger jabbing at Glynnis' face.

"Mom, let's be honest—Dad's tired of you. Isabella is always with Alexander, cozying up to Evadne. She's unreliable. You only have me now." Glynnis smirked.

Elspeth's brows furrowed. Her daughter was too much like her—and that resemblance sent a chill down her spine. "What do you want?"

"I know Alexander despises me. There's no chance for us. But if I can't have him, then Isabella won't either!" Glynnis' voice dripped with venom. "Tonight, Alexander brought her to see Dad. They were all so happy together. It's clear Dad approves of their relationship. You have to find a way to stop her from marrying into the Fairhaven family!"

Elspeth scoffed. "Alexander is obsessed with your sister. What can I do?"

"Then I suppose Ward stays alive." Glynnis' lips curled into a predator's smile. "Mom, you know as well as I do—you're stuck here. Who else can you rely on but me?"

Elspeth's eyes burned with fury. This insolent wretch was challenging her!

Seeing her mother's hesitation, Glynnis pressed on. "You want to ride Alexander's coattails to higher status. But think—even if Isabella marries him, what can she do for you? Alexander is Sebastian's best friend. Isabella is Evadne's little pet. Since your downfall, I've been the one looking after you. What has Isabella done besides frolicking with Alexander? She hasn't even married into the Fairhavens yet, and she's already forgotten the mother who raised her!"

Elspeth was stunned into silence.

Whether Isabella's marriage would benefit her was irrelevant. Right now, she was trapped, barely able to protect herself—let alone meddle in her daughter's love life.

Children were flesh and blood, but eventually, they became someone else's spouse. Survival was all that mattered.

"Fine. I agree!" Elspeth's voice was hollow, her teeth grinding. "As long as you deal with Ward, I swear—the Fairhavens will never accept Isabella!"

A vicious light sparked in Glynnis' eyes.

Even if Alexander insisted on marrying that fool, so what? If she couldn't enter the Fairhaven family properly, she'd forever be nothing more than a mistress.

In the study, the atmosphere was warm and harmonious.

Frederic and Alexander chatted idly. As the elder, Frederic inquired about his business ventures. Alexander, having prepared extensively for this meeting, answered smoothly.

He had grown up with Sebastian and knew the Windermere Estate better than his own home. But facing his future father-in-law, even the usually composed Alexander felt a flicker of nerves.

"Mr. Fairhaven, your tea. Miss Isabella, your favorite orange juice." Dennis approached with a tray.

"Thank you, Dennis." Isabella took the glass, her smile as innocent and radiant as spring flowers—unchanged from her childhood.

A warmth spread through Dennis' chest.

Glynnis and Isabella, though sisters, were night and day. Glynnis lacked the grace expected of a lady, behaving more like a wild child. But Isabella—she was pure, untouched by the world's cruelty.

He had once worried about her future, fearing her autism would condemn her to loneliness. But now, with Alexander's devotion, her happiness was assured.

Isabella took a sip of her juice, her lips glistening.

Alexander chuckled, pulling out a handkerchief to gently wipe her mouth. The practiced motion suggested he did this often.

"Ahem." Frederic cleared his throat, having indulged the sweet scene long enough. "Alexander, after everything, it's clear you care for Isabella. I've watched you grow up. If you wish to date my daughter, I won't stand in your way."

He paused, his expression turning serious. "But Isabella is young, sheltered. This is her first relationship—her first time spending nights away from home. She's never been out after dark, and you've broken our family rules."

"I apologize, Mr. Abernathy." Alexander grinned cheekily. "But with Isabella at my place, I can't let her go out at night. The world is full of dangerous men. How could I rest easy?"

Frederic shook his head. "I'm not talking about her safety. I'm talking about propriety. You're not married yet. If word spreads that you're living together, it won't affect you—but my daughter's reputation will suffer."
###Chapter 430

Though Evelyn had always been dismissed as "simple-minded" by Victoria since childhood, she was far from it. At the mention of "living together," her slender shoulders tensed, and the sweetness of her freshly squeezed orange juice turned bitter on her lips.

Nathaniel discreetly took her small, cool hand in his, gripping it firmly. "Mr. Sinclair, I know my past hasn't been spotless, but I'm asking for a chance to change—to start over. I may have had my wild days, but I've never been vulgar. And Evelyn is the first and only woman I've ever brought home."

"Nathaniel, what I mean is—"

"Let me be blunt. I can't live without her now."

Nathaniel's chest swelled with overwhelming love. He pressed a fervent kiss to Evelyn's hand, his gaze brimming with a devotion that was impossible to ignore. "If I go a single day without seeing her, I think I'll lose my mind."

His deep, tender voice sent a feather-light flutter through Evelyn's heart.

She felt the same. The thought of being apart from Nathaniel was unbearable. Without him, she couldn't eat, couldn't sleep—couldn't function.

Frederick's cheeks burned red. He'd encountered all sorts of people in his life, but never someone so shameless! To speak like this in front of an elder—utterly disgraceful!

"There's another reason I don't want Evelyn returning to Windsor Estates," Nathaniel continued, his tone turning serious.

Frederick frowned. "And what's that?"

"I'm afraid she might be mistreated."

"Preposterous!" Frederick's brows knitted tighter. "Evelyn is my treasure. Windsor Estates is her home. Who would dare bully her here?"

"Mr. Sinclair, you're rarely home, so it's understandable if you're unaware of what happens under your own roof. But you can't assume that just because Evelyn lives here, she's happy."

Nathaniel didn't outright accuse Victoria. After all, she was also Frederick's daughter. If he exposed her cruelties without tact, he'd humiliate his future father-in-law. More importantly, he believed he could protect Evelyn himself.

Even if Frederick knew everything, what could he do? He hadn't even realized the extent of his own wife's misdeeds—how could he confront Victoria?

Daniel stood silently nearby, watching Frederick with quiet intrigue.

Everyone at Windsor Estates knew Victoria had tormented Evelyn for years. Even Eleanor, the woman who raised them, was aware. Only Frederick, their own father, remained oblivious.

"Evelyn, who dares bully you in this house?" Frederick demanded, his gaze locked onto his timid daughter, struggling to contain his rising fury.

Evelyn's forehead glistened with sweat. She opened her mouth but couldn't force out a single word.

Nathaniel felt her palm dampen in his. He leaned closer, his voice soft but firm. "Evelyn, don't be afraid. You have me and your father here. If you've suffered, speak up. We'll stand by you."

He desperately wanted her to expose Victoria's cruelty—to demand justice for herself.

Two pairs of expectant eyes bore into her. After a long pause, Evelyn finally whispered, "No... no one bullies me."

"Evelyn." Nathaniel's heart sank. But when his hand brushed against her back, he realized her dress was soaked through with sweat.

His expression darkened, his chest tightening as if squeezed by an invisible fist. He was pushing her too hard. He shouldn't force her to relive her pain or seek vengeance.

The woman he loved didn't need to fight. He would fight for her.

"Was it your sister?"

Frederick's sudden question struck Evelyn like an arrow. She lowered her head, fingers twisting the fabric of her dress, but remained silent.

"Is it true? Has Victoria been tormenting you all this time? Tell me, and I'll make it right!"

"Mr. Sinclair, you know Evelyn's nature. She isn't like Victoria, who knows how to charm you. Because Victoria is family, Evelyn endures in silence—too kind-hearted to retaliate."

Nathaniel couldn't hold back any longer. His voice turned icy. "What's done is done. There's no point dredging up the past. Besides, you consider both your daughters precious, don't you?"

His words didn't name Victoria, but the implication was clear.

Frederick's face darkened, his large hand clenching into a fist on his knee.

Nathaniel helped Evelyn to her feet, his arm slipping possessively around her waist, pulling her close.

"The past stays in the past. For your sake, I'll let it go. But the future is different. Now that Evelyn is mine, I won't tolerate anyone hurting her. No matter who they are, they'll pay dearly."

After Nathaniel and Evelyn left, the study grew suffocatingly tense. Frederick could still feel the chilling weight of Nathaniel's words pressing down on him.

"So even Nathaniel knows Victoria has been bullying Evelyn?" Frederick turned to Daniel in disbelief. "The servants knew. Everyone knew—except me? Her own father?"

Daniel sighed. "Mr. Sinclair, don't be too hard on yourself. Managing an estate and a corporation—it's easy to overlook things."

Frederick buried his face in his hands. "I've failed her. I didn't realize how miserable she was at home."

"But that's over now. Evelyn has Nathaniel—someone who cherishes and protects her. You can rest easy." Daniel spoke earnestly. "She's grown, Mr. Sinclair. Keeping her locked away, sheltered from the world—it isn't healthy. And haven't you noticed? Since being with Nathaniel, she's happier. More alive."

Frederick nodded faintly. It was true—he hadn't seen his daughter smile so brightly in years.

"Victoria... I've spoiled her rotten! How could she treat her own sister this way!" The memory of Victoria's childhood innocence twisted like a knife in his chest.

Daniel hesitated before adding, "Mr. Sinclair, you know what they say—'You lie with dogs, you rise with fleas.'"

Frederick's jaw clenched.

A knock interrupted them. Victoria's saccharine voice floated through the door. "Daddy? Are you busy?"

"Come in."

Victoria entered, radiant, carrying a tray. "Daddy, I know I upset you earlier. I brought your favorite snacks to apologize. Don't be mad, okay?"

She set the tray down and moved to hug him, as she always did when seeking forgiveness. But this time, Frederick held up a hand to stop her.

"I hope this is the last time you disgrace yourself. You're a Sinclair—act like it. Or you're no better than a common social climber."

Victoria froze mid-step, forcing a smile. "Of course, Daddy. It won't happen again."

Frederick didn't touch the food.

"Daddy, the equestrian event is coming up. You loved my riding outfit last year, right? I had one made for you too. Want to try it on?"

Her attempts to placate him fell flat.

"Victoria, you won't be attending this year."

Her face paled. "What? You always take me!"

"This year is different."

"Why?" Panic flashed in her eyes. "All the elite families will be there! You can't exclude me!"

"This year, I'm taking Evelyn."

Victoria's mind reeled. "What?"

"Why not? She's my daughter too. A Sinclair."

Frederick finally met her gaze, his eyes colder than she'd ever seen. "You've gone for years—surely you're tired of it. Evelyn's never been. Most of Elmsworth doesn't even know her. From now on, she'll have these opportunities. It's only fair."

Fair?

After neglecting Evelyn for over a decade, now he cared about fairness?

Victoria's lips trembled. "But—Evelyn's condition! What if she has an episode?"

"Don't worry. Nathaniel will take care of her."

Her face drained of color.

"Leave. I have work to do."

As Victoria turned away, her eyes burned with hatred, teeth grinding in silent fury.
###Chapter 431

Ward hadn't slept properly since meeting Evadne and Thaddeus. Her words haunted him, replaying in his mind like a broken record.

That silver-tongued witch had offered him a deal too tempting to refuse. Even if it was all a lie, he was tempted. But he despised them too much—their perfect faces, their effortless wealth. One was Elmsworth's rising business tycoon, the other the dazzling heiress of the city's most powerful family.

Just thinking about them made his blood boil.

And he blamed them for his current misery. He wanted Elspeth to keep tormenting them from the outside, to turn that golden couple into fugitives.

For days, prison life had been uneventful. But recently, he'd felt eyes watching him—dark, sinister eyes that sent chills down his spine. It ruined his appetite, kept him tossing at night.

Tonight was no different. He lay on the filthy mattress, skin crawling, unable to sleep.

Just as exhaustion finally pulled him under, a faint rustling sound jolted him awake.

Too close.

Years as a mercenary had sharpened his senses—most wouldn't have noticed.

Ward twisted to face the threat, but he was too slow.

A sharp, searing pain exploded in his neck.

In the dim light, he saw a man from his own cell driving a sharpened toothbrush handle into his flesh. Blood gurgled in his throat, a sickening sound.

"Die."

The man shoved the makeshift weapon deeper.

Ward choked, gripping the attacker's arm. "Who—who sent you?"

"No grudge. Just business."

Business?

Elspeth.

The name flashed in his mind before darkness swallowed him.

Thaddeus had followed Evadne's orders, resting at home instead of returning to work.

But he wasn't idle.

Every night, while she slept, he slipped into the study, buried in paperwork until dawn. Only then would he return to bed, pressing soft kisses along her skin before finally sleeping beside her.

That afternoon, Evadne took him to the Ashbourne family hospital. Dr. Larry examined him personally.

The results were perfect. His wounds were healing faster than expected.

Evadne beamed, throwing her arms around him, pressing a kiss to his neck. "This is amazing!"

She didn't notice the fire in his eyes, the way his breath hitched.

Thaddeus swallowed hard, voice rough. "Yes. Amazing."

He leaned in, lips brushing her ear. "I've waited too long for this. Any longer, and I'd lose my mind."

Heat flooded her cheeks.

Dr. Larry cleared his throat. "Congratulations, Mr. Abernathy. I'll, uh, leave you two alone."

He bolted before Evadne could protest.

She tried to follow, but Thaddeus held her waist, trapping her.

"Let me go!"

"No." He kissed her nose, voice thick with want. "No excuses this time."

"Excuses?"

"You're not on your period. I'm healed." His gaze burned. "How will you reject me now?"

She remembered all the nights they'd spent like roommates, all the times she'd pushed him away for his own good. Even on the plane, when he'd pleasured her with his hands but denied himself.

Now, pinned beneath him, she pressed a hand to his chest. "Is this all you want from me?" Her voice trembled. "Am I just a toy for your pleasure?"

Thaddeus stilled. The hunger in his eyes softened. "Silly girl," he murmured, kissing her forehead. "I want you. Only you."

Tears welled in her eyes.

He sighed. "After everything we've been through, don't you know how much I cherish you? I want every day with you to feel like our honeymoon. Even when we're old, I'll still hold you like this."

Evadne stared at him, silent.

"Are you crying?" Panic flashed across his face. "I'm sorry. I won't—"

She cut him off with a searing kiss, arms locking around his neck.

Thaddeus lost control.

Her dress tore under his hands.

What started as her taking charge ended with her surrendering to his passion, consumed by fire.

Sweet, aching fire.

They slept tangled together until late morning.

Thaddeus woke first, watching Evadne sleep on his arm, unwilling to move despite the numbness.

When she finally stirred, they showered together—though it took twice as long as necessary.

Brushing their teeth side by side, Evadne answered a call from Dr. Victor.

"You're back already?" she asked around her toothbrush.

Thaddeus tensed.

"I couldn't stay away," Victor said softly.

Thaddeus scoffed.

Evadne shot him a look. "Where are you staying? Let me arrange something."

"No need. I'm safe." Victor lowered his voice. "Elspeth's medicine should be running out soon."

Evadne's eyes gleamed. "Good."

"Without it, she'll contact me. This time, I'll increase the dosage. She'll be too weak to fight back."

"Perfect." Evadne exhaled. "We're almost there."

Just then, Thaddeus's phone rang.

Mr. Gordon's voice crackled through. "Mr. Abernathy! Ward wants to meet you and Mrs. Abernathy!"
###Chapter 432

The deep resonance of Gordon's voice carried through the air, reaching even Isabella's ears.

"Dr. Nathaniel, I have urgent matters to attend to. I'll contact you later."

Isabella ended the call abruptly, her gaze immediately locking onto Alexander with a spark of excitement.

The corner of Alexander's lips curled into a smirk as his large hand tousled her hair. "What finally made him crack?"

"Last night, Ward was attacked by his cellmate—stabbed in the neck with a sharpened toothbrush. He barely fought back in time before the guards intervened and saved his life."

Alexander and Isabella exchanged a heavy glance. "How is he now?"

"Released on medical parole. The moment he was stable, he started demanding to see you and Mrs. Sinclair. Fear has a way of loosening tongues."

Gordon chuckled darkly. "A few days in, and someone already tried to kill him. How's he supposed to survive the next twenty years? Clearly, he's desperate for your mercy."

Isabella's eyes gleamed with satisfaction. She rose onto her toes, wrapping her arms around Alexander's neck and pressing a sweet kiss to his cheek.

Alexander's grip tightened around her waist, effortlessly lifting her against him. The sheer strength in his arms sent a thrill through her.

His other hand cradled the back of her head as he deepened the kiss, his lips claiming hers with possessive hunger.

The air between them grew thick, charged with unspoken desire.

"Brilliant as always," Isabella murmured, her nose brushing against his. "You saw right through that wicked stepmother's schemes."

"Only because I have you," Alexander admitted, his voice rough. "Your sharp mind keeps me on my toes. Without you, I wouldn't have thought of this."

He nipped at her lower lip. "Elspeth panicked when you used the media against her. She had to act fast to cover her tracks. Now she's under house arrest, Alex and Ward are behind bars—yet she still managed to orchestrate an attack from inside her gilded cage. Impressive connections."

Isabella arched a brow. "Don't forget your darling sister, Glynnis. When it comes to ruthlessness, she's in a league of her own."

"I only have one sister," Alexander growled, his grip tightening. "Mari."

His gaze darkened, predatory. "But you—you seem to have quite the collection of devoted male friends."

"Who? Dr. Nathaniel?" Isabella teased, tracing his jawline. "Are you jealous?"

"What do you think?"

The dangerous glint in his eyes sent a shiver down her spine.

"Any man who goes to such lengths for you—aside from your father, brothers, and me—clearly wants more than friendship."

"And what if they do?" She flicked her hair over her shoulder. "I'm a woman many desire. If you can't handle Dr. Nathaniel, you're in for a rough ride, darling."

Even knowing she was teasing, jealousy coiled in his chest.

Isabella relented, her breath warm against his ear. "Out of all the men in the world, I only want you."

Alexander's heart hammered.

Memories of the past flooded back—how cold he'd been, how much she'd endured. The thought of another man near her now made his blood boil. How had she stayed by his side through all those years of torment?

The guilt was a knife twisting in his chest.

"Hey." Isabella frowned, noticing his reddened eyes. "It was just a joke. Why are you getting emotional?"

"Nothing." He forced a smile. "Let's clean up and meet Aaron. Then we'll deal with Ward."

She tried to slip from his arms, but he held her tighter, their bodies pressed flush.

"Isabella," he murmured, his voice rough with need. "I'm hungry."

Without another word, he carried her toward the bedroom. "Feed me first. Then I'll have the energy to work."

She smacked his shoulder in protest.

God, maybe I should be the one hospitalized for a few days.

By the time they arrived at the prison gates, dusk had settled.

Though spring had arrived, the evening wind carried a biting chill.

Alexander shrugged off his suit jacket, draping it over Isabella's shoulders before pulling her close.

They stood in the shadows, listening to the rustling leaves, their expressions calm but hearts racing.

"He confessed," Isabella finally said.

"Yes. Everything." Alexander exhaled, relief washing over him. "It's almost over."

"Not yet. Eden is still missing."

"Eden's testimony won't change Ward's fate. He's not connected to Elspeth."

Isabella's eyes hardened. "That man nearly killed you and my brother. Whether he's tied to Elspeth or not, I won't let him walk free."

And then there was the mastermind—Avery.

But without concrete evidence, it was all speculation.

Eden was the missing link.

After a long silence, Alexander spoke. "Leave Eden to me and Jareth. You've been through enough with my injury and Elspeth's case. Let me handle this."

Isabella softened. "Alright. I trust you."

Alexander pulled her close, their hearts beating as one.

"Are you worried I'll overwork myself," she asked quietly, "or is this about Avery? Do you think I'll hesitate because of our past?"

Alexander remained silent.

"Are you overthinking this?" She poked his chest. "Avery and I were never more than friends. Even if we had been, I wouldn't forgive what he's done. I won't show mercy when it's time to act."

"What if the evidence proves Eden wasn't involved with Avery?" Alexander's voice was hoarse. "What if I was wrong?"

"That doesn't excuse his crimes. Not after what he did to Debby and her husband—or nearly destroying my brother-in-law."

The memories of her family's suffering made her fists clench.

Avery had crossed a line.

And for Isabella, that line was her family—and the man beside her.

"I've done terrible things too," Alexander whispered. "Why do you forgive me?"

"Are you comparing yourself to him?" She scowled.

"No. It's guilt."

"You're nothing like him." She rested her head on his shoulder. "I know you—better than you think."

Before he could respond, her phone buzzed.

Emeric's name flashed on the screen.

"What is it, Emeric?" she answered casually.

Alexander tensed, palms damp.

"Where are you?" Emeric's tone was sharp.

"What's wrong?"

"Are you in Elmsworth?"

"Is something happening?"

"Are you with Alexander?" His voice turned icy. "Not only are you together, but he's staying at your place?"

Alexander caught his name and stiffened.

Isabella's eyes darkened. "Are you having me followed?"

"I'm concerned about my daughter. Is that a crime?"

She scoffed. "I was alone overseas for six years, and you never sent so much as a birthday card. Suddenly you care?"

Her anger flared. "Did retirement make you nostalgic, or are you just bored?"

Alexander frowned.

Six years alone overseas?

Why would the Sinclairs, who adored her, allow that?

"Come home. Now." Emeric's voice was steel. "You're a Sinclair heiress, living with your ex-husband under the same roof. If you're not embarrassed, I am!"

"You married four times. If you're not ashamed, why should I be?"

Emeric nearly exploded.

Father and daughter—both sharp as knives.

As they argued, Alexander pieced it together. Emeric disapproved of their relationship.

The realization stung, but he didn't resent it. He'd brought this on himself.

"Regardless, return immediately," Emeric snapped. "The horse racing event is this weekend—a crucial partnership for our future. Every major family in Elmsworth will be there. You will attend with me."

Major families.

Meaning the Abernathys and Chambers would be present.

This would be interesting.

Isabella exhaled. "Fine."

"And stay away from that Abernathy boy!" Emeric's disdain was palpable. "My daughter deserves better than a man who abandoned and humiliated her. You may have forgotten, but I haven't."

His voice turned lethal. "Not unless I'm dead. Goodbye."

The line went dead.

Isabella sighed, glancing at Alexander's frozen expression. "Heard all that?"

"Yeah." His shoulders slumped.

"Emeric's stubborn. Given your history, his reaction isn't surprising."

"I understand."

"But it doesn't matter." She cupped his face. "We've come this far. I believe in us."

Her eyes sparkled. "If Emeric refuses to accept us—if the world turns against us—would you give up on me?"

Alexander searched her gaze. "Would you give up on me?"

She pretended to consider it, then shook her head.

"Never."

Alexander crushed her to his chest, his throat tight.

"If you stay, I stay."

No matter what.
###Chapter 433

The annual horse racing event in Elmsworth was the most anticipated social gathering of the year.

Noble families gathered at the prestigious racecourse, their smiles masking the ruthless power plays beneath the surface.

For the elite, this was more than a sporting event—it was a battleground of alliances and betrayals.

Deals worth millions were sealed with handshakes in the VIP lounges. Many would kill for an invitation, hoping to climb the social ladder.

Glynnis had been fuming ever since Frederic banned her from attending. The stress had given her mouth ulcers, making it painful to eat.

She couldn’t fathom why her father would punish her so severely over a few harsh words to the servants.

Was her disgrace somehow tied to Elspeth’s fall from grace?

Men. All the same—heartless beasts.

Her only solace was the hope that Jareth would discard Mari once he grew bored.

Then, she’d make sure everyone knew Mari was nothing more than a temporary plaything.

A knock interrupted her bitter thoughts.

"Glynnis, your mother wants to see you."

She found Elspeth in a state of agitation.

"Mom, what is it?"

The moment she stepped inside, a foul odor assaulted her senses.

"What is that smell?" Glynnis wrinkled her nose, moving cautiously toward the bedroom.

The sight that greeted her was shocking.

Elspeth, disheveled in a wrinkled nightgown, was on her knees, desperately scrubbing a yellowish stain on the floor.

"Mom, what—"

"Who told you to barge in?!" Elspeth snapped, her voice sharp with humiliation. "Knock next time!"

"You—you called for me," Glynnis stammered, realization dawning. "Mom... you didn’t—"

"Not another word!" Elspeth cut her off, eyes blazing. "Do you hear me?"

Glynnis nodded quickly.

"You have to stop taking that drug!" she pleaded, worry etched on her face. "It’s destroying you! Victor is poisoning you—look at what it’s done!"

For once, Glynnis spoke with genuine concern.

Elspeth exhaled shakily. "I know. But I can’t stop. Without it, I feel like I’m dying."

Glynnis had never experienced addiction, but the agony in Elspeth’s twisted expression was unmistakable.

"Did you take care of Ward?" Elspeth suddenly demanded, her tone dark.

Glynnis hesitated. "I arranged it, but... no news yet. It’s not easy inside a prison."

Elspeth’s eyes burned with fury. "Useless! All of them!"

"Mom, be patient. The man I hired is limited in what he can do. We’ll hear something soon."

"Patient?!" Elspeth’s voice cracked. "Every second Ward breathes, I can’t sleep! Evadne and Thaddeus have probably already gotten to him!"

Glynnis understood the danger but had no solution.

A sharp knock made both women jump.

"Who is it?" Elspeth called, moving to the door.

Dennis’s voice came through. "Ma’am, Mr. Abernathy sent me. He requests your presence at the horse races this weekend."

Elspeth’s face transformed. "Frederic wants me there? He’s not ignoring me anymore?"

"It’s tradition for you both to attend," Dennis replied smoothly.

"Yes, yes! I’ll be there!"

The moment the door closed, Elspeth nearly collapsed with relief.

After weeks of isolation, she was finally free. Did this mean Frederic had forgiven her?

But then reality set in. Without her medication, she had no control over her body.

If she had an accident in public, the humiliation would be unbearable. Frederic would never look at her the same.

Yet refusing to go would insult him further.

Glynnis saw her dilemma. "Mom, are you worried about... your condition?"

"What choice do I have?" Elspeth sank to the floor, defeated.

"I can’t function without that poison. I hear voices, see things... I’m losing my mind!"

The hallucinations were getting worse. Only Victor’s drugs brought relief.

"Wear adult diapers," Glynnis whispered. "No one will know but me."

Elspeth recoiled at the suggestion. But Glynnis was right—this was her only chance.

"Fine," she muttered.

"Now, my turn," Glynnis said, seizing the moment. "Convince Father to let me go too."

Elspeth glared. "You’re pushing it."

"Mom, listen! If I’m there, I can help you. Plus, all the eligible bachelors will be there. Don’t you want me married into power?"

Elspeth considered it, then nodded. "I’ll try."

Glynnis hugged her, a sly smile curling her lips.

That night, Evadne soaked in the bath with Thaddeus.

Later, wrapped in a robe, she sat before the mirror as he dried her hair.

"You’re surprisingly good at this," she mused. "If the CEO gig falls through, you could be a hairstylist."

"Only for you," he murmured, kissing her neck. "Do I get a tip?"

Evadne laughed, swatting him away. "Give me a break. I need energy for tomorrow."

Thaddeus relented, holding her close in bed.

"Evadne," he said softly.

"Hmm?"

"Could you make me another suit?"

She turned to face him. "You really like my designs?"

"I always did," he admitted. "I was just too proud to say it."

Evadne smiled. "I’ll make you one when I’m back."

The next morning, Cassius’s car arrived to take her home.

Thaddeus watched until the Rolls-Royce disappeared, already missing her.

Alva approached, dusting her hands. "Found a weird rock by the gate. Nearly gave me a heart attack."

Thaddeus flushed. "That’s... Lover’s Lookout."

Back in Silveke Harbor, Evadne found the house empty. Bored, she napped until her phone rang.

Victor’s voice was eager. "Elspeth contacted me. She’s desperate for more medication."

"Withdrawal symptoms?" Evadne yawned.

"Severe. Incontinence, hallucinations. She’s attending the horse races with Frederic and wants me there."

Evadne smirked. "Perfect. Tell her you’ll deliver it at the event."

A plan formed in her mind.

This weekend just got interesting.
###Chapter 434

The trio had spent the day at a charming countryside festival, followed by an indulgent shopping spree and a delightful stop at a chic tea salon before returning home in high spirits.

To outsiders, their dynamic as three women sharing one household might seem unconventional. Most would expect bitter rivalry or dramatic clashes, but their bond was more sisterly than anything. Even Evadne sometimes felt a twinge of envy witnessing their closeness.

Emeric must have performed miracles in a past life to deserve such unwavering devotion from these women.

"You went out without me? I'm seriously offended!"

Evadne perched on the garden swing, her feet barely grazing the ground as she swayed lightly, her posture as carefree as a teenager's.

"Oh, darling, it wasn't intentional!"

Aviana slipped behind her, wrapping her arms affectionately around Evadne's shoulders. "You decided to come home without warning us. If we'd known, nothing short of your father breaking a leg would've kept us away!"

Evadne's lips twitched.

Suri and Myra stiffened. "Aviana, don't tempt fate!"

"Relax! If something happened to Emeric, where would I find another sugar daddy as reliable as him?" Aviana laughed, hands on her hips.

The other three exchanged exasperated glances.

Thankfully, Emeric wasn't around to hear that.

Otherwise, he might've collapsed on the spot.

"Myra wanted to visit the festival, so we accompanied her for a change of scenery," Suri explained gently, taking Evadne's hand.

"I'm sorry, Evadne," Myra added, her voice soft. "I'll make your favorite dinner tonight to make it up to you." She turned toward the kitchen immediately.

"Myra, wait! I was joking!"

Evadne sprang up, pulling her back with a pout. "You're too easy to tease."

Seeing Myra's timid demeanor, a pang of sympathy struck her.

Living so cautiously must be exhausting.

"Myra, how have you been? Feeling better?" Evadne asked gently.

"Don't worry about me, I'm fine," Myra murmured, stroking Evadne's hair with tender concern. "But you—your father's been beside himself. He barely eats, he's lost weight. He misses you terribly."

"Exactly! Even Myra's cooking can't tempt him anymore," Aviana chimed in.

Guilt flickered in Evadne's chest, but she masked it well.

"Evadne, I heard Emeric shouting at you over the phone the other day. Did you two argue?" Suri ventured cautiously.

"Not exactly."

"Not exactly? Ever since then, he's been in a foul mood. This morning, he looked like a storm cloud," Aviana shuddered.

"Evadne, what happened? Your father rarely loses his temper," Myra pressed, worried.

Evadne inhaled deeply. "I got back together with Thaddeus."

Silence.

Then, in unison, the trio nodded. "No wonder. It's a miracle Emeric hasn't burned down the Abernathy estate or turned Thaddeus into a punching bag."

Before they could probe further, the butler hurried in. "Miss, Mr. Ashbourne requests your presence in the study."

"Alright."

Evadne stood, bracing herself. The trio exchanged glances and rose to accompany her, fearing Emeric's wrath.

In the study, Emeric sat stiffly on the sofa, his expression dark as he sipped his coffee. The usual warmth between father and daughter was absent, replaced by palpable tension.

"Why are you all here? I only need to speak with Evadne."

He set his cup down heavily, glaring at his wives. "She's grown now. Do you think I'm going to spank her like a child? If I were to hit anyone, it'd be that Abernathy boy first!"

Evadne's face fell.

"Emeric—"

Suri stepped forward protectively. "Thaddeus has risked his life for Evadne multiple times. He truly loves her."

"Risked his life? What do you mean? Has Evadne been in danger?!" Emeric lurched forward, panic flashing in his eyes.

"I'm fine. Suri's exaggerating," Evadne cut in quickly.

She wasn't hiding Thaddeus's devotion—she feared the shock might worsen her father's health.

She'd already lost her mother. She couldn't lose him too.

Emeric leaned back, his gaze sharp. "I don't care what spell that boy has cast on you. Even if he handed you the Abernathy Group as a wedding gift, I'd never approve. His life isn't worth the pain he's caused you or the years you've wasted!"

His anger was fierce, but unsurprising.

Everyone knew Evadne was his heart, his everything.

When Evadne was in elementary school, her doll-like beauty made her popular with boys—and a target for jealous girls. One spoiled classmate tormented her, ruining her homework, stealing her hairpins, even sabotaging her water bottle.

Young Evadne, sharp and resilient, brushed it off. She never told Emeric, not wanting to worry him.

Until the day that girl snipped off her braids.

When Emeric saw his daughter's ruined hair, he nearly wept. But little Evadne just smiled, comforting him.

Three days later, that girl vanished from school.

Her family went bankrupt. Her father was imprisoned. Her mother, realizing they'd crossed the Ashbournes, fell gravely ill and never recovered.

Given that history, Emeric's restraint toward Thaddeus was nothing short of divine intervention.

And that intervention was Evadne's doing.

If not for her pleas, Thaddeus would've been buried long ago.

"Dad, I share blame for my failed marriage," Evadne said firmly, dropping the casual "Emeric." "I pushed for it, knowing he didn't love me. Could you accept a marriage under those terms?"

"Evadne! Have you lost your mind? There are countless worthy men—why chain yourself to that coward?!"

Emeric slammed the table, trembling with rage. "He could've refused the marriage! But he caved to pressure, abandoning his lover like a spineless fool. He doesn't deserve you!"

Evadne's fists clenched, her heart leaden.

"Dad, it's not like that."

"Enough! Break it off—now. Or I'll do it myself." His voice was ice. "Your divorce is public knowledge. If you cling to him, people will assume no one else would have you. Have you no pride? No regard for our family's dignity?"

"I don't care what people think. No one dictates who I love." Her tone was steel.

Emeric's face flushed crimson. Suddenly, he swayed, gripping the sofa arm as the room spun.

"Dad?!"

Evadne lunged forward, catching his shaking form. The trio rushed over in alarm.

"I'm fine," Emeric muttered, eyes squeezed shut against the pain.

Suri calmly retrieved medication from the desk drawer, pressing pills into his hand.

"Take these."

Evadne snatched the bottle, her blood running cold at the label.

"Stroke medication?"

"From Bright Biopharma. Extremely limited supply," Suri explained, watching Emeric's labored breathing. "But lately, it's been less effective. He's had two minor strokes this year already."

"You all knew? And kept it from me?" Tears spilled down Evadne's cheeks.

"Cassius and Arnold don't know either. He didn't want to worry you kids."

Suri dabbed Emeric's brow with a handkerchief. "Don't be angry with him, Evadne. He loves you too much to see you hurt."

"Who dares look down on her?" Aviana snarled, eyes blazing. "Evadne is our treasure. Anyone who insults her will lose their eyes and tongue!"

Evadne clutched her father's cold hand, guilt crushing her.

She'd been selfish, chasing Thaddeus while oblivious to her family's pain.

A knock interrupted them.

Suri composed herself and answered. "Yes?"

"Madam, a visitor awaits outside," the butler said.

"At this hour? Who?"

"Mr. Avery Chambers."

Evadne's gaze darkened as she stood, a chill settling over her.

"Stay with Father. I'll handle this."

Outside, beneath the grand gate, Avery stood patiently, his tall frame silhouetted by the light. The rumors of his cruelty seemed at odds with his gentle demeanor.

Hearing the door open, he turned, his hazel eyes brightening behind gold-rimmed glasses. A warm smile curved his lips.

"Evadne."

His voice was tender.

She approached, her expression frosty.

"What do you want?"

Avery's smile faltered. "I saw Emeric at an event today. He seemed unwell. I came to check on him."
###Chapter 435

The dim light cast shadows across Isabella's face, accentuating the sharp angles of her cheekbones.

Once, she might have believed Nathan truly cared for her father. Now, all she sensed was deception.

If he could harm her sister and brother without hesitation, her father meant nothing to him.

Nathan had always been ruthless.

Only his obsession with her held him back—for now. Until he had her, until his hunger was satisfied, he wouldn’t dare lay a hand on her.

"My father is fine," Isabella said coolly, a frosty smile playing on her lips. "He’s as healthy as ever. Probably just ate something that disagreed with him. Nothing serious. You can leave."

"Are you sure?" Nathan’s brow furrowed in concern. "He looked terrible earlier. Pale, clutching his head—could it be something worse? A stroke, perhaps?"

"Are you wishing illness on my father, Nathan?"

Isabella’s voice cut through the air like a blade, her eyes flashing with fury. "Or are you just fishing for information about the Sinclair family?"

"Isabella, no. You’ve got it all wrong."

His eyes darkened with distress as he stepped forward, seizing her wrist. "I’m just worried about him. And I wanted to see you."

She recoiled as if burned, wrenching her arm free and putting distance between them.

"But I don’t want to see you."

"Isabella, what’s happened to you?"

Nathan’s lips trembled, his voice raw with desperation. He moved to close the gap again, but her icy glare stopped him cold. "Tell me what’s wrong. Please. Don’t shut me out like this."

So convincing. Isabella’s nails dug into her palms. Those eyes—so full of false innocence.

"You want to know? Fine." She took a sharp breath, her words dripping with venom. "You know Ethan, don’t you? He’s yours, isn’t he?"

"Ethan?" Nathan blinked, feigning confusion. "Who’s that?"

But beneath his tailored suit, tension coiled like a serpent.

He’d thought he’d buried every trace. Even if Isabella had suspicions—even if she’d connected him to his dealings in Helgen, his ties to Country T’s officials—she had no proof.

Without catching Ethan red-handed, she couldn’t pin anything on him.

Yet here she was, confronting him outright. Had she truly lost all faith in him?

"You’ve built an empire in Helgen," she said, crossing her arms. "You have connections everywhere—high-ranking officials, military leaders. Ethan is a lieutenant colonel in Country T’s army, and he started in Helgen. Are you seriously telling me you don’t know him?"

Her mocking laugh was beautiful enough to steal his breath.

"Isabella, I have some influence, but you’re giving me too much credit." Nathan’s voice cracked with urgency. "But if this Ethan has hurt you, I swear—I’ll destroy him for you."

She scoffed. "Of course you would. You’d want him dead more than anyone. He’s a loose end—one that could expose everything you’ve done."

"Isabella, how can you think that of me?"

Tears welled in Nathan’s eyes, his lips pale from biting them.

He played the wounded martyr perfectly, so lost in the role he forgot he was the one who’d brought danger to her doorstep.

Isabella just watched him, her expression unreadable.

"What happened?" Nathan pressed, desperation bleeding into his voice. "Tell me what I’ve done to make you doubt me. At least let me explain!"

She knew she wouldn’t get the truth. This was a warning—pressure him into slipping up. And a brutal reminder: whatever they’d had was over.

"Fine. You won’t admit to Ethan. Then what about my sister Diana and her husband?" Her voice shook with rage. "How did you exploit them in Helgen? Will you deny that too?"

"Nathan, some people in my company did cross lines with your brother-in-law," he admitted hoarsely. "But when I found out Diana was your sister, I stopped it immediately. The problem is, the company isn’t just mine. Other shareholders fought me every step of the way. I tried to protect them, but I couldn’t control everything."

His eyes burned with sincerity. "Isabella, I’ve loved you for fifteen years. How could I ever want to hurt your family?"

She stared at him, silence stretching between them like a chasm.

Finally, she turned away. "Leave. Now."

As she walked off, Nathan grabbed her from behind, pulling her against him. "Isabella, don’t go—"

"Let go of me!"

A shudder ran down her spine. She fought free like a cornered animal, her glare sharp enough to draw blood.

Nathan stumbled back, his face ashen.

"I’m with someone, Nathan. Even if I weren’t, you have no right to touch me." Her rejection was absolute.

"Your boyfriend? Alexander?" His voice shattered. "You’re back together?"

"Why wouldn’t I be?" Her throat tightened as she remembered Alexander’s battered body, the wounds he’d taken for her. "He nearly died avenging me in Country T. A man who loves me like that—how could I not want him?"

She turned, her voice steel. "Leave. I will uncover the truth about Ethan. And if you’re behind it, Nathan, you know what I’ll do. I don’t care who you are."

As she walked away, Nathan’s voice cracked behind her.

"Isabella... my mother is sick. Very sick."

She froze but didn’t look back.

"Late-stage Alzheimer’s. She barely recognizes me now. Can’t even feed herself. Her limbs are failing." His voice broke. "I’ve been at the hospital night and day. The only reason I’ve left at all is for you."

A tear slipped down his cheek. "She asks for you constantly. Even now, in her haze, she remembers you. Please... just see her once. It might help."

Isabella stood rigid, her back to him.

Just as she stepped toward the door, it opened.

"Sophia?" Isabella blinked at her stepmother’s sudden appearance.

Sophia gave her a gentle smile before turning to Nathan, her expression stern. "Mr. Prescott, my husband would like to speak with you. Please, come inside."

"What?" Isabella hissed. "He’s still recovering. What is he thinking?"

Sophia sighed. "I’m just relaying his request."

Nathan adjusted his glasses, a faint smirk tugging at his lips. "Thank you, Mrs. Sinclair."

Inside the study—a space reserved only for William’s closest confidants—Nathan stood before the patriarch, his posture impeccable.

Isabella sank onto the living room sofa, her mind racing.

"Your father has been meeting with Nathan frequently," Sophia murmured, taking her hand. "And with Jeffrey, too. I think... he’s serious about this."

"About what?"

"About marrying you into the Prescott family."

Isabella’s laugh was bitter. "Over my dead body."

"Don’t say such things!" Sophia scolded. "We won’t let him force you into a marriage you don’t want. Your brothers, your sisters—we’ll all stand with you."

"This isn’t about an alliance," Isabella said quietly. "It’s about keeping me away from Alexander. He’ll do anything to tear us apart."

She closed her eyes. "And I know exactly where he gets that stubbornness from."

Sophia squeezed her hand. "Out of all his children, you are the most like him."

A vibration in her pocket made Isabella start.

Her heart leapt at Alexander’s name on the screen.

"I’ll give you privacy." Sophia stood gracefully.

Isabella answered, her pulse racing.

"Can’t sleep?" Alexander’s voice was warm velvet, sending shivers down her spine.

"Not tired," she lied, stepping onto the balcony. The moon hung heavy in the sky.

"Missing me, then?" His chuckle was unfairly attractive.

"Please. I don’t need a man to sleep." Her cheeks burned.

"But I need you," he murmured. "You’re my everything."

The words sent heat flooding through her.

She missed him. God, she missed him.

"What did you do today?" She changed the subject.

"Breathed. Thought about you. Repeat."

"Alexander, flattery is nice, but tone it down." She rubbed her arms, goosebumps rising.

His tone shifted. "My contact in City R reached out."

"The maid Elspeth bribed to swap your mother’s medication?" Isabella’s mind raced.

"Found her in a small town. Her life’s fallen apart—husband gambled everything away, son’s in jail. Karma’s a bitch."

"She deserves worse," Isabella spat. "A life for a life."

"First, I need her alive," Alexander said darkly. "If Elspeth finds out, she’ll silence her permanently."

Isabella nodded. "How’s your father?"

"Fine. Everyone’s fine." She forced lightness into her voice.

"Isabella." His concern was palpable. "You’re hiding something."

"Nothing important." She exhaled. "Rest. I’ll see you soon."

His voice wrapped around her like a blanket. "I’ll always wait for you."

As they whispered sweet nothings, Nathan watched from the shadows, his jaw clenched.

Soon, Isabella. You’ll be mine—and only mine.
###Chapter 436

Evadne Ashbourne juggled caring for her family while secretly executing her carefully laid plans.

Emeric's deteriorating health demanded immediate attention. After consulting with her three trusted companions, Evadne decided to summon Cassius and Arnold home. As the eldest sons, their presence was non-negotiable.

Simultaneously, Suri discreetly arranged for Chasel Bright to examine Emeric.

Though Evadne was a brilliant surgeon, neurology was Chasel's domain.

The Ashbourne family gathered anxiously as Chasel conducted his examination, hanging onto his every word. Only Cassius lingered at the periphery, his piercing gaze fixed on the doctor in the white coat.

Their eyes locked briefly—Chasel's knowing, Cassius's guarded—before the latter looked away, pulse racing.

"Chairman Emeric's condition has declined," Chasel explained calmly, "but it's manageable with proper medication and lifestyle changes."

Myra, the family's culinary expert, immediately began mentally revising Emeric's meal plans.

Arnold groaned. "He'll hate this. No more midnight cake raids."

"At sixty, he should know better," Evadne chided, though her heart ached seeing her father's frailty.

Chasel's tone turned grave. "Most critically, avoid emotional extremes—especially anger. It exacerbates his condition."

Everyone nodded—except Evadne, whose lashes shadowed her troubled eyes.

Later at Silverlake Harbor, Emeric protested Myra's bland congee. "Not even pickles?"

The family chorused: "Absolutely not!"

When Emeric announced plans to attend the Elmsworth Derby, Suri hesitated. "Should you be traveling?"

"This isn't optional," Emeric insisted. "K Group needs visibility among Elmsworth's elite."

Evadne saw her opening. "Take Myra this time."

The room stilled. Myra flushed. "I'm no good at these events—"

"You enjoyed the county fair," Evadne countered.

Suri, sensing Evadne's intent, supported the idea. "The media already speculates why I always accompany you."

Emeric turned to Myra, taking her trembling hand. "Have I misunderstood your wishes all these years?"

Tears welled in Myra's eyes. Evadne's chest tightened seeing her stepmother's fragility—the once-radiant star now shrinking from the spotlight.

Ultimately, Emeric ordered bespoke attire for Myra, ensuring she'd shine at the event.

Later, Evadne cornered Myra. "You can't hide forever. Remember who you were—the nation's dream girl."

"That was manufactured fame," Myra whispered.

"For Nydia's sake, reclaim your strength." Evadne leaned closer. "And prepare for my surprise."

Meanwhile at Elmsworth Manor, Thaddeus Abernathy monitored developments with calculated precision. His mother's killer remained under surveillance, while Ward's "death" had been convincingly staged.

Gordon delivered the warden's confirmation: "The bait's been taken."

Thaddeus absently traced his phone's screensaver—a makeup-free Evadne bathed in sunlight.

"Mrs. Abernathy's breathtaking," Gordon blurted.

Thaddeus's glare could freeze magma. "Eyes to yourself."

When Gordon suggested visiting Evadne, Thaddeus shook his head. "She deserves this time with her family. And Emeric wouldn't welcome me."

His jaw tightened. Patience—their future had decades to unfold.

Across town, Glynnis Abernathy danced through the mansion upon hearing of Ward's demise. She rushed to Elspeth's darkened bedroom.

"He's really dead!"

Elspeth rewarded her with a sealed envelope. "Your compensation."

Glynnis clutched it like the Holy Grail. Inside lay Mari's psychiatric evaluation—the Abernathy family's best-kept secret.

Her laughter turned manic. This would destroy Mari's engagement to Jareth Fairhaven.

Edith Fairhaven answered Glynnis's call with bored disdain. "What now?"

"Meet me tomorrow. I have something that'll obliterate Mari's wedding dreams."

Edith yawned. "Your obsession is pathological."

"Just wait." Glynnis's smile turned feral. "The derby will be... enlightening."
###Chapter 437

The grandest social event of the year had arrived, right on schedule.

Every year, the prestigious Horse Racing Gala wasn’t just attended by the elite families of the nation—it was also broadcasted live across all major platforms by the government. Even royalty from allied nations graced the occasion, making it an affair of unparalleled grandeur.

The honor of hosting rotated among the wealthiest families.

This year, it was the Chambers family’s turn.

The race took place at the newly constructed Central Park Racecourse, a project spearheaded by the Chambers family and completed in less than six months. The venue hadn’t even been officially unveiled yet, and here it was, hosting an event of this magnitude. Jeff Chambers was over the moon!

Could there be a more perfect opportunity for publicity?

A flawless victory!

Over at the Abernathy Group, Hamilton, now retired and rarely seen at public functions, had passed the baton to his son. Today, it was Frederic Abernathy and his wife, Elspeth, who arrived at the racecourse, while Thaddeus would make his entrance alone.

Just as they were about to leave, Glynnis rushed out in towering stilettos, clad in a scandalously tight pink mini dress.

Frederic shot her a disapproving glance, his expression icy. "The racecourse is an open-air venue. What exactly do you plan to do when the wind picks up in that ridiculous outfit?"

With that, he turned and stepped into the car, leaving Elspeth and Glynnis standing there.

Glynnis seethed internally but kept her composure. Opportunities like this were rare, and she couldn’t afford to anger Frederic again.

As Elspeth moved to enter the car, Glynnis grabbed her arm and whispered, "Mom, did you put it on?"

Elspeth’s face twisted with discomfort.

That morning, she’d spent far too long mentally preparing herself to wear the adult diaper. Even though it functioned like a sanitary pad, the humiliation was unbearable. She was the wife of the Abernathy Group’s tycoon! At her age, to resort to such a thing—it was mortifying.

"Mom, did you bring extras? One won’t be enough!" Glynnis fretted.

"And where exactly am I supposed to carry them?" Elspeth snapped, her cheeks burning. "The ladies here carry clutches, not oversized bags! One will have to do. I’ll just avoid drinking anything. Besides, after today, I won’t need this wretched thing ever again!"

With that, Elspeth climbed into the car, leaving Glynnis standing there, puzzled.

After today?

The realization hit her like a freight train.

At precisely 10 AM, the Central Park Racecourse buzzed with excitement.

This year’s attendance had doubled, far exceeding expectations.

The prime seats on the second floor were reserved for the four great families—the Abernathys, the Chambers, the Fairhavens, and the Ashbournes of Skyrim.

Socialites and heiresses peered through their binoculars, green with envy.

A few had tried sneaking into the exclusive section, but security was impenetrable. Unless you were a member of the four families or their invited guest, entry was impossible.

"Glynnis and Edith are only here because of their last names. When it comes to grace and elegance, they’re nowhere near the caliber of the Ashbourne heiress!"

"Exactly! Evadne Ashbourne is in a league of her own—CEO, world-renowned jewelry designer. What do Glynnis and Edith have? Just their family names."

"Even divorced, Evadne is still the Ashbourne princess. Some people are just bitter."

The whispers reached Edith’s ears, making her blood boil.

She’d spent weeks picking out her outfit, yet Evadne still outshone her effortlessly.

What stung even more was Thaddeus, who had already dismissed everything—and everyone—to stride toward Evadne.

The Chambers family, as hosts, entered first.

Next came the Abernathys. Frederic and Elspeth walked hand-in-hand, dispelling rumors of marital discord.

Glynnis trailed behind, preening for the cameras as if she were on a red carpet.

Unfortunately, no one was looking at her.

All lenses were trained on Frederic and Elspeth. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn’t outshine her own mother.

Any publicity is good publicity, she told herself.

At least she wasn’t as infamous as Elspeth.

Pathetic.

"Is Mr. Abernathy not coming? I’ve been waiting forever!" a reporter whined.

"Just wait a little longer!"

"All four families will be here today. This is going to be explosive!"

Journalists adjusted their cameras, eager for drama. "Evadne will definitely show, and so will Edith. The ex-wife and the rumored mistress—what a showdown!"

"Remember when Evadne held that funeral for the Abernathy maid? Thaddeus declared in front of everyone that he belonged to her. That was bold."

"Men say anything to save face. What about his late-night hotel rendezvous with Edith? If Evadne takes him back after that, she’s a fool."

As the Abernathys entered, the Fairhaven motorcade arrived.

A sleek line of black cars rolled in, the epitome of the Fairhaven Group’s extravagant style.

Gary stepped out first, followed by his mother and Edith.

"Dad, take it slow."

"Grandpa, let me help!"

Gary and Edith played the perfect grandchildren, supporting Barry between them.

Barry, unusually, was in good spirits—until he paused, scanning the crowd. "Where’s my eldest grandson? Why isn’t he here?"

"Jareth must be tied up with something. He’ll be late," Mrs. Fairhaven said quickly.

"Or someone," Gary teased.

Barry frowned. "Who?"

"Who else? Elspeth’s second daughter, Mari."

Edith chimed in, feigning innocence. "Lately, my brother barely comes home. He and Mari have their own little love nest. When Mom was hospitalized last week, I was the one who accompanied her."

She sighed dramatically. "They say a son forgets his mother when he finds a wife. My brother isn’t even married yet, and he’s already forgotten us."

"Edith, enough," Mrs. Fairhaven chided softly—not defending Mari, but fearing Barry’s wrath.

Gary chuckled. "Mari must be something special. Jareth’s never been serious about anyone before."

"Elspeth’s daughter, stealing my grandson’s heart? Never!" Barry’s cane struck the ground. "Living together without marriage? Is this how a proper lady behaves? Elspeth’s reputation is in tatters, and clearly, her daughter is no better!"

"Don’t worry, Dad," Gary said slyly. "We Fairhavens have a son. We won’t be at a disadvantage."

Mrs. Fairhaven exhaled in relief.

A sinister smile flickered in Edith’s eyes.

No matter how much Jareth loved Mari, as long as she was Elspeth’s daughter, she’d never set foot in the Fairhaven mansion.

Suddenly, the crowd erupted.

"Mr. Abernathy is here!"

"It’s Thaddeus!"

Cameras flashed wildly.

Edith’s heart raced as she turned toward the red carpet.

There he was—Thaddeus Abernathy, standing alone in his black suit, his chiseled features as cold and unreadable as ever. His presence commanded attention, his dominance undeniable.

This aloof, untouchable aura was what drove women mad.

Including Edith.

"Edith, let’s go," Mrs. Fairhaven urged.

"He’s so handsome," Edith murmured, transfixed. "I want him so badly."

"Compose yourself. This isn’t dignified."

"Dignity?" Edith muttered. "Who needs dignity when I can have him?"

"Edith, what did you say?"

"Nothing. You go ahead. I’ll wait for Thaddeus. I want to enter with him."

She wasn’t about to miss this chance. If she walked in beside Thaddeus, the media would go wild.

Thaddeus never brought dates to events—not even his ex-wife. If she could secure this moment, she’d prove to the world she was special to him.

Actions spoke louder than words.

This misunderstanding would drive a wedge between him and Evadne, and she’d be there to capitalize on it.

As Thaddeus approached, her heart pounded. "Thad—"

But he walked right past her, as if she were invisible.

Then, a voice rang out.

"The Ashbournes are here!"

Thaddeus’s entire demeanor shifted. His eyes lit up, his posture straightening as he turned eagerly.

A sleek Lincoln glided to a stop.

Cassius Ashbourne stepped out first, impeccably dressed, before offering his hand to his sister.

The crowd gasped.

Even knowing they were siblings, the sight was breathtaking—a vision of elegance and nobility.

Thaddeus’s world narrowed to one person.

Evadne.

Dressed in a stunning sky-blue chiffon gown and matching floral hat, she looked every inch the aristocratic princess.

Her almond eyes sparkled, warm and bright.

"She’s breathtaking! Like royalty!" reporters murmured.

"This is how you dress for a horse race. The Ashbournes understand tradition. Unlike Glynnis and Edith—their outfits are all wrong."

"Evadne wins this round."

Edith’s nails dug into her palms.

She’d planned her outfit for weeks, yet Evadne still outshone her effortlessly.

Worse, Thaddeus was already striding toward Evadne, his gaze fixed on her like she was the only woman in the world.
###Chapter 438

The moment Thaddeus's gaze landed on Evadne, the ice in his eyes melted into warmth.

She had known him for years. Even as a child, he had treated her with gentleness—though distant.

But now?

The way he looked at her spoke volumes.

Evadne was special.

Edith's jaw clenched so hard her teeth ached. Her vision burned red as she watched Thaddeus stride toward his goddess.

Evadne noticed him immediately.

Tall. Commanding. Impossible to ignore.

His presence alone drew every eye in the room.

"Evadne," Cassius murmured, amusement lacing his usually stern tone. "Your boy is coming for you."

"Why should I care?" She huffed, though her pulse betrayed her. "We agreed to keep our distance today. He promised to listen to me. Liar!"

Cassius smirked.

Nearby, Emeric and Myra walked arm-in-arm down the red carpet, drawing gasps.

Myra's outfit—tailored by Evadne—mirrored her daughter's in color but carried an elegant sophistication. The tulle-draped hat softened her features, lending her an ethereal grace.

"Is that Emeric? He looks decades younger!"

"Imagine him in his prime—handsome as Thaddeus Abernathy!"

"And Myra... stunning. No wonder she outshone Elspeth back then."

Myra flushed, fingers tightening around Emeric's arm.

"Relax," he murmured. "Who dares insult my wife?"

Her lips trembled. "I just... don’t want to embarrass you or the children."

Emeric's grip on her hand tightened. "You never could."

She smiled, bittersweet.

She knew she wasn’t his first love.

But she was content.

The crowd erupted again as Thaddeus approached Evadne.

Emeric's glare could have melted steel.

"Chairman Emeric," Thaddeus said, eyes locked on Evadne. "May I escort your daughter?"

Emeric's voice was ice. "Plenty of women here would kill for that honor. Why her?"

"Because it’s only ever been her."

Thaddeus held out his hand.

Evadne’s cheeks burned.

The entire room sighed.

Edith, too far to hear, seethed at the reporters' reactions.

Emeric shot Evadne a look.

She sighed. "Mr. Abernathy, you should go alone."

Thaddeus didn’t hesitate.

He grabbed her hand and pulled her flush against him, claiming her before the world.

"Evadne," he murmured, voice thick with affection. "Let’s go."

She scowled. "You’re impossible."

"I’m persistent."

His lips brushed her ear. "And very, very clingy."

They left under envious stares, their images splashed across the jumbotron.

Myra sighed. "They’re perfect together."

Emeric grunted. "I don’t see it."

"You were young once. You know love can’t be stopped."

"Love?" Emeric scoffed. "If he truly loved her, he’d let her go."

Myra fell silent.

Evadne tugged Thaddeus’s arm. "You realize my father hates three things? Losing his woman, his daughter, or both."

Thaddeus paled.

"Congratulations," she teased. "You just ticked all three."

Suddenly, her expression darkened. "Is everything ready?"

"Of course." His thumb traced her knuckles. "I’d never disappoint you."

Her pulse skipped—until she spotted Edith lurking nearby, eyes venomous.

Even now, the memory of their scandal stung.

"Thad," Edith cooed, batting her lashes. "I’ve been waiting for you."

His gaze turned arctic. "I never asked you to."

Her smile faltered. "But we were supposed to—"

"Leave."

The single word shattered her.

Evadne’s grip on Thaddeus loosened.

He interlaced their fingers tighter and steered her away.

Once alone, she yanked free. "Go find your girlfriend."

He caught her waist. "You know she’s lying."

"I know." Her voice cracked. "But it still hurts."

Thaddeus’s chest ached. "I was an idiot. I should’ve seen through that setup."

"You were worried about me." She sighed. "But I’d never be that careless."

"Never again." He pressed his forehead to hers. "Thank you for trusting me."

Her lips quirked. "Just don’t make me regret it."

He kissed her—deep, possessive—until she shoved him away.

"My makeup!"

He grinned. "Worth it."

Elsewhere, Elspeth scrolled through social media, nails digging into her phone.

Myra and Evadne trended everywhere.

No scandals. No shame.

Just praise.

Thirty years of scheming—for nothing.

Her bladder screamed.

"Are you okay?" Frederic asked absently.

"Fine," she hissed.

"Leave if you’re unwell."

Her smile was razor-thin. "I wouldn’t miss this for the world."
###Chapter 439

The phone buzzed relentlessly, its screen lighting up with breaking news alerts. Once again, Thaddeus and Evadne dominated the headlines, their names blazing across every trending list. Their public appearances together—despite being exes—ignited fierce debates and captivated the nation's attention.

They were the perfect match, a power couple that could have ruled the business world together.

But Frederic's face darkened at the news.

"Oh, look at that," Elspeth sneered, scrolling through the gossip on her phone. "Chairman Emeric really hit the jackpot with a daughter like Evadne. She’s a media magnet. Everyone else just fades into the background when she’s around." She smirked. "Thaddeus and her aren’t exactly subtle. Frederic, why don’t you seize the moment and propose an alliance with Chairman Emeric? After all, Evadne’s secret marriage to Thaddeus left us all in the dark. It’s like we owe the Ashbournes a favor. Now’s the perfect time to make amends."

The Fairhavens had already taken their seats, and Mrs. Fairhaven sat just across from Elspeth.

She heard every word and grimaced in disgust. Elspeth’s words were nauseating.

Having such a matriarch was a curse that could haunt the Abernathys for generations. It was a miracle the family hadn’t crumbled yet, likely held together only by sheer stubbornness. The thought of her daughter, Edith, being tied to such a family made her head throb.

Thaddeus, the man Edith adored, had grown into an impressive figure under her watchful gaze.

But the Abernathys were a tangled mess, and Thaddeus—despite his current power—was still seen as an illegitimate son. With a half-brother looming over him and Mr. Hamilton’s failing health, how long could he hold on?

Mrs. Fairhaven wasn’t sold on this match for her daughter.

A second marriage at his age? Hardly a prize for Edith.

"Dad, Mom’s right," Glynnis chimed in mockingly. "Just look at Thad and Evadne, acting like lovesick teenagers. It’s like she’s scheming her way back into his life, and he looks ready to hand her the world. They’re clearly smitten. Daddy, why not play Cupid? Let’s give them their happy ending."

Glynnis knew Frederic’s temper well. If she played her cards right, pushing for Thaddeus and Evadne would only make things worse.

Frederic stared at the photos, his jaw tightening at the sight of his son’s submissive demeanor around Evadne.

"My son will not remarry a woman he divorced himself. I won’t allow such disgrace! Emeric’s daughter or not, no woman will control him!"

His words left no room for argument.

Elspeth and Glynnis exchanged smug glances.

Just then, the Chambers Group arrived. Matthew, the CEO, and his wife Elva were busy greeting guests, leaving Jeff to enter with Avery and Bertha.

"Barry, long time no see," Jeff said casually, not bothering to extend a hand.

Though both were patriarchs, Jeff, as the younger, should have shown respect first.

Barry didn’t stand either, replying coolly, "Indeed, it has been."

The tension between the tycoons was palpable.

"Avery, Mr. Ashbourne’s here. Go greet him. We can’t neglect our friends," Jeff said loudly, ensuring the Fairhavens and Abernathys heard.

His message was clear: only the Ashbournes mattered to the Chambers Group.

Frederic and Barry’s expressions darkened.

"Yes, Dad."

Avery adjusted his glasses, his face unreadable as he walked away.

He’d heard about Evadne and Thaddeus’s grand entrance, humiliating Edith.

If they announced a reconciliation today, everything would fall apart.

He couldn’t let that happen.

In a secluded hallway, Avery dialed Harvey.

"Mr. Chambers?"

"Is everything set with the media?"

"All ready. The press releases are prepped. Just say the word, and every major outlet will break the news."

"Good."

Avery smirked. "First, leak that the Abernathys and Ashbournes are at odds while the Ashbournes and Chambers are cozying up. Have someone take photos to back it up."

"Yes, sir. But isn’t this too soon?"

"The red carpet fiasco is already out. If we don’t act now, it’ll be too late." Avery’s grip on the phone tightened. "I won’t let that bastard steal Evadne from me."

The image of Evadne and Thaddeus arm in arm burned in his mind.

He had to strike first. Their relationship couldn’t survive the light. If it couldn’t, it deserved to die in the dark.

Meanwhile, Barry checked his watch, frowning. "Where’s Jareth? Call him."

"Right away," Mrs. Fairhaven said anxiously.

"And where’s Edith? These kids are getting out of hand!"

Mention of his late eldest son—Edith’s father—made Barry’s heart ache.

Gary noticed, his fake smile masking tension as he crushed his cigar.

Thaddeus had matters to attend to and entered the field with Evadne. After a brief, tender moment, they parted.

Evadne walked alone, her heels clicking sharply in the empty hall.

"Hey, stop!"

Edith’s shrill voice cut through the silence.

Evadne didn’t stop.

She’d known Edith was following her but hadn’t cared enough to acknowledge her.

"Did you go deaf? I said stop!"

Edith, clutching her messy dress, rushed ahead, nearly tripping.

Evadne almost laughed.

"And why should I?"

"You—!" Edith’s face twisted with rage.

"Spit it out or get lost. I don’t have time for your nonsense." Evadne’s smirk was ice-cold.

Edith trembled, intimidated by her aura.

Evadne and Thaddeus were becoming eerily similar—even their gazes matched. Was this the so-called "couple’s look"?

"Nothing to say? Then move."

As Evadne turned to leave, Edith sneered, "You think Thad’s sincere? He’s just putting on a show because you’re the Ashbourne heiress now!"

Evadne laughed. "If that were true, you’d be quietly watching. Instead, you’re here, seething with jealousy. Pathetic."

Edith faltered.

"Know who the most pitiful people are?" Evadne leaned in, her voice dripping with scorn. "Liars like you, who deceive themselves into believing their own lies."

Edith’s face burned with humiliation.

She wouldn’t give up.

"Evadne, do you trust everything Thad says? I thought you were smarter, but you’re just another fool in love!"

"Save it."

"You’ll believe me soon enough." Edith stepped closer, her voice mocking. "Thad came to my room—you saw the footage. Want to know what happened? I was fresh out of the shower, completely bare. He held me so tight, his breath hot on my skin..."

Evadne’s eyes flashed with fury.

"His hands were all over me. He couldn’t get enough." Edith giggled. "Look at your face. He never told you, did he? Of course not. Men always hide their dirty little secrets."

"Edith."

"Upset? You said you wouldn’t believe me, but now you have no choice."

Seeing Evadne’s rage, Edith’s grin turned manic. "Hit me. You want to, don’t you? Do it."

Evadne clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms.

She wouldn’t give Edith the satisfaction.

But then—

Snap!

The sharp sound echoed through the hall.

Evadne froze.

Edith stood in the grand hall, her cheek red from the slap she’d just delivered to herself. Her hair was disheveled, her face already swelling.

With a dramatic cry, she stumbled back through the open doors and collapsed on the floor.

The crowd outside—reporters, guests, staff—gasped. Whispers erupted.

"What happened? Let’s get closer—this is better than TV!"

"Did Evadne just slap Edith? Over what?"

"Must be over a man!"

"Probably Thaddeus. That guy’s a magnet for drama."

"Evadne didn’t hold back. Edith’s face is swollen."

"This is unacceptable. No matter how angry, you can’t just hit people!"

The crowd turned against Evadne, branding her the aggressor.

Edith, the perfect victim, trembled and sobbed. "Evadne, this is too much! Even if you hate me over Thaddeus, I’ve never wronged you. Just because you’re the Ashbourne heiress doesn’t give you the right to bully me!"

Her tears fueled the crowd’s outrage.

"Who does she think she is? This isn’t her kingdom!"

"Edith’s family is just as powerful. She shouldn’t take this!"

Evadne listened, then laughed—a cold, scornful sound that sent chills down spines.

Laughing?

Edith’s act faltered.

"Well, this is entertaining," Evadne said, her voice icy. "I did want to hit you. But you saved me the trouble. How convenient."

She smirked. "Guess it’s my lucky day."
###Chapter 440

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

"Seriously? Evelyn hit herself?"

Her cheek was swollen—had she really gone that far?

Evelyn's face paled, her flushed skin turning ghostly white. "Arabella, what nonsense are you spouting? Why would I hit myself?"

"I think you did lose your mind," Arabella drawled, shrugging. "Not only are you unhinged, but you also scared the hell out of me. I'm being generous not suing you for emotional distress, and here you are, trying to pin this on me? Just because you're a Vanderbilt, you think you can play dirty?"

The room erupted in murmurs.

Camera flashes exploded in Evelyn's direction, capturing her ashen expression.

"Ms. Sinclair's reputation is impeccable. She's known for her charity work—even covered funeral expenses for that Abernathy family servant. Why would she frame Evelyn?"

"Even if Arabella did hit her, there must've been a reason."

"Maybe it was a catfight over jealousy, but violence is never justified. I'm starting to doubt Arabella's character!"

Arabella was sick of these petty theatrics. If Evelyn wanted to scheme, couldn’t she at least be creative?

Truth didn’t need defending. Being misunderstood didn’t faze her.

Besides, Evelyn had done the damage to herself—that was the real win.

Just as Arabella turned to leave, a sharp voice cut through the crowd.

"Evelyn! What happened to you? Who did this?"

The crowd parted, revealing Reginald Vanderbilt flanked by family and bodyguards.

"Grandfather. Mother." Evelyn's eyes welled with tears, her lips trembling.

Seeing her daughter disheveled, cheeks swollen, and Arabella standing there coolly, Mrs. Vanderbilt immediately assumed the worst.

"Help her up!"

At Reginald's command, bodyguards rushed forward, shielding Evelyn from the cameras.

"Oh, Evelyn!" Mrs. Vanderbilt pulled her daughter close, glaring at Arabella. "Ms. Sinclair! If you have a problem with me, take it up with me. Why attack my daughter?"

"Mother, don’t upset yourself. I’m fine." Evelyn patted her mother’s arm, playing the victim.

The scene was heartbreaking—to anyone who didn’t know better.

Then the Sinclairs arrived, shifting the atmosphere.

Evelyn’s crude scheme had escalated, dragging in the heavyweights.

"William, your daughter has quite the temper—striking someone in public," Reginald said coldly, gripping his cane. "Clearly, you indulge her. But every child is precious. Arabella is yours, and Evelyn is mine. I demand an explanation!"

The Vanderbilts weren’t to be trifled with.

If this had been anyone else, they’d have been crushed.

Sebastian’s gaze darkened as he stared at Evelyn, making her shrink into her mother’s arms.

Eleanor rushed to Arabella’s side, gripping her hand. "Arabella, are you hurt?"

Her words made the Vanderbilt women seethe with envy.

"I’m fine, Mother. Don’t worry."

"Arabella would never attack someone unprovoked. Others might doubt her, but we don’t." Eleanor’s icy stare pinned Evelyn in place.

William frowned, studying his daughter with a conflicted expression.

He wasn’t concerned about Arabella hitting someone—if she had, so be it. His daughter had dealt with plenty of troublemakers before.

His worry was the fallout.

If this spread, how would the public see her?

Reputation mattered. If she was to lead Sinclair Holdings one day, she needed credibility. Otherwise, rivals would use this against her.

"Reginald, Mrs. Vanderbilt, where’s your proof?"

A calm voice cut through the tension.

All eyes turned to Nathaniel Kingsley as he stepped forward.

Arabella’s gaze remained cool, unreadable.

She didn’t need saving—and if she did, she’d prefer it came from Alexander.

Not Nathaniel.

"Mr. Kingsley, are you suggesting Evelyn framed Arabella?" Reginald’s voice was sharp.

"Whether she did or not is for her to answer. One wrong move could ruin her."

Nathaniel moved to stand before Arabella, his gaze tender, oblivious to the whispers around them.

"The Kingsley heir is clearly smitten. First the charity auction, now this—risking the Vanderbilts’ wrath? His stance is obvious."

"I don’t get William’s hesitation. One’s the CEO of Abernathy Enterprises, the other’s the Kingsley golden boy."

"If you ask me, Nathaniel’s the clear choice. Spotless reputation. Alexander? He’s a walking scandal—first Acacia, now Evelyn. What parent would want that for their child?"

Evelyn’s heart pounded. She’d never met Nathaniel, yet something about him terrified her.

His voice, his presence—it felt familiar.

And the fear was suffocating.

"Mr. Kingsley, are you accusing my daughter of lying?" Mrs. Vanderbilt’s voice shook. "She’s been beaten, and you’re defending her attacker? I know your families are close, but this is too much!"

Evelyn’s mind raced. She’d checked—no cameras in that hallway.

So why was Nathaniel so confident? Had he seen something?

"Evelyn," Nathaniel pressed closer, his dark eyes glinting. "Did Arabella really hit you?"

Her throat tightened.

"Words have consequences. Don’t wait until the truth comes out—regret has no cure."

Silence.

The crowd waited.

Those seconds stretched into agony.

Finally, under Nathaniel’s lethal gaze, she cracked.

"I—I had a disagreement with Ms. Sinclair. I lost my footing and... hit the door. Fell."

She didn’t mention the slap.

But the admission was enough.

Gasps erupted.

"She did hit herself? That’s twisted!"

"Clearly, Nathaniel pressured her into confessing. Did you see how she folded?"

"Pathetic. If it were me, I’d never admit it. Make him prove it!"

"And you’re defending her? This is slander. If the Sinclairs press charges, Evelyn’s finished."

Nathaniel had cleared the mess effortlessly.

Yet Arabella showed no gratitude.

William’s tension eased, and he nodded approvingly at Nathaniel.

Sebastian slung an arm around Arabella’s shoulders, addressing Reginald calmly.

"Mr. Vanderbilt, does your granddaughter still require an apology? If you insist, we can settle this legally after the derby. Bring the lawyers, decide at the station—public or private."

William smirked internally.

He couldn’t say it himself, but Sebastian—young and bold—could.

Mrs. Vanderbilt panicked, clutching Evelyn. Reginald’s face darkened.

Sebastian’s lips curled. "The Sinclairs own our actions. But if someone frames my sister, I won’t let it slide. I’m sure you, as a doting grandfather, understand."

The Vanderbilts were cornered.

Agree, and risk exposure. Refuse, and look guilty.

"Misunderstanding! Just a misunderstanding!"

Dominic Vanderbilt stepped in, chuckling. "Kids fight! Evelyn’s just... spirited. Spoiled. Says things she doesn’t mean. Our families go way back. My brother and William were close. Evelyn’s his legacy—she’s not that far gone."

William’s anger cooled.

He’d admired Evelyn’s father. His death had been a loss.

Had he lived, the Vanderbilts would’ve rivaled the Abernathys.

"Enough. The derby’s a celebration. We won’t ruin it over this." William waved a hand magnanimously. "Reginald, if Evelyn apologizes, we’ll consider it settled."

Evelyn’s vision went red.

Apologizing to Arabella? Worse than a knife to the gut.

"Evelyn, apologize. Now." Reginald’s voice was ice.

Trembling, she forced the words out.

"I’m sorry. It was my fault."

Arabella smiled sweetly. "It’s fine. Just don’t do it again. Your ‘tantrums’ could ruin someone. Not everyone can stand up to the Vanderbilts."

The crowd stiffened.

A gift wrapped in poison—ruthless.

Two hashtags trended instantly:

#EvelynHitsHerself

#EvelynApologizesToArabella

[LMAO Evelyn hit herself? Performance art?]

[She needs therapy. The Vanderbilts should check her into a clinic.]

Evelyn was the day’s laughingstock—and the Vanderbilts’ reputation tanked with her.

Reginald shot Evelyn a disappointed glare and stormed off.

Mrs. Vanderbilt, defeated, followed, with Dominic at their side.

"Thank you, Dominic," Mrs. Vanderbilt whispered tearfully.

"Family looks out for family." His smile was cryptic.

Without her husband, she felt powerless. "Alexander’s obsessed with that Abernathy girl. He’s forgotten us."

"Don’t say that. He’s filial. And without your approval, that girl will never be your daughter-in-law."

Mrs. Vanderbilt nodded, resolve hardening.

Meanwhile, William clapped Nathaniel’s shoulder warmly.

"Nathaniel, I owe you. You saved Arabella’s reputation—and our family’s honor. How can I thank you?"

Nathaniel’s gaze lingered on Arabella. "No thanks needed. My loyalty’s always been to Arabella—to your family. If you insist, just let me see her more often. That’s all I ask."
###Chapter 441

Evadne's piercing gaze locked onto Avery, her fingers curling into fists so tight her knuckles turned white. The polished charm he wore like armor couldn't hide the darkness she knew simmered beneath.

"Good boy," Emeric murmured, eyes twinkling with unspoken approval. His voice dripped with paternal warmth. "Plenty of time for you and Evadne to grow... closer."

Camera flashes erupted, capturing the moment. Gasps rippled through the crowd.

Emeric, a titan of industry, rarely showed such favor to anyone outside his inner circle. Yet here he was, treating Avery like a son—like family.

Whispers slithered through the guests.

"Chairman Emeric's practically matchmaking them, isn't he?"

"Obviously. Ice-cold to Thaddeus but sunshine for Avery? The Ashbournes and Chambers have been thick as thieves for generations. If Evadne hadn't been so stubborn, she'd have been engaged to Avery years ago."

A scoff. "Please. Since when do heirs in our world get a say in marriage? Emeric indulged her once. You think he'll tolerate defiance twice?"

Evadne couldn't stomach another second. Spine rigid, she turned on her heel and strode away.

"Evadne!" Avery caught her arm, concern etching his features. "Still upset about Edith?"

Silence.

"Tell me what you need," he pressed, stepping closer. "Name it. I'll make it happen."

She whirled on him. "Do you actually have proof Edith tried to ruin me? Or was that just another lie?"

Avery chuckled, adjusting his glasses. "A bluff. But she's hiding something. People like her always fear exposure."

"Edith's tougher than Glynnis. The Fairhavens' golden girl, coddled by Barry and Jareth—you really think empty threats would shake her?" Evadne's eyes narrowed. "Unless... you two have an understanding. Did she spare you as a favor?"

The barb struck true. Avery's smile didn't waver, but something dangerous flickered behind his lenses. "The only woman I answer to is you."

"Stop." She recoiled. "My heart belongs to someone else. Your obsession is pathetic."

His breath hitched as if she'd driven a knife between his ribs.

"Evadne, what I feel for you—"

"Mr. Chambers," she cut in, voice glacial, "indulge your fantasies elsewhere. And quit groveling to Emeric. No matter how hard you try, I'll never choose you over Thaddeus."

Miles away, Thaddeus was finalizing strategy with Gordon when the news hit.

Evadne. Edith. A public ambush.

By the time he raced to the scene, it was over. The crowd had dispersed. Only Gordon stood there, grim-faced.

"Edith apologized. The internet's crucifying her. Everyone's siding with Evadne now."

Thaddeus exhaled—until Gordon added, "But it was Avery who saved her. And with Emeric cozying up to him? Rumor has it the Ashbournes and Chambers might merge. Evadne could end up Avery's wife."

The words were a gut punch.

Thaddeus was halfway to finding Evadne when William Morris, chairman of Aether Dynamics, materialized with his entourage.

"Mr. Abernathy." William's smile didn't reach his eyes. "You stood us up. We assumed you'd resigned."

His son, Ford, smirked. "Honestly, we expected Chad. The real Abernathy heir."

Thaddeus's jaw tightened. Missing their meeting had cost him. The J Group's recent billion-dollar deal with Abernathy meant this rift couldn't stand.

"Disappointing you wasn't my intention," Thaddeus countered smoothly, extending a hand. "But since we're here—let's talk business. Sentiment has no place in profit, wouldn't you agree?"

William hesitated, then shook. "We'll hold you to that."

At the Fairhaven table, tension crackled.

Barry patted Gary's shoulder. "You handled Edith's mess well."

Edith seethed silently while Glynnis smirked at her humiliation.

Gary waved it off. "Family looks out for family."

The phrase soured Barry's mood—until Jareth arrived, hand-in-hand with Mari.

Bertha beamed. "What a stunning couple! When's the wedding?"

Mrs. Fairhaven's smile was frostier than a winter morning. "Marriage isn't a game, Jareth. Are you certain about this?"

Edith sneered. "After your parade of exes? Poor Mari doesn't know what she's in for."

Jareth's grip on Mari tightened. "I've never been more sure of anything. I'll give her everything."

Barry's cane thudded against the floor.

"In this life," Jareth declared, staring down his family, "I marry Mari or no one."

The room froze.

Evadne, watching from the shadows, felt tears prick her eyes. This was love—unshakable, defiant.

If only Thaddeus could—

Her thoughts shattered as ceremonial cannons boomed. Confetti rained down. The races had begun.

Thaddeus spotted Evadne instantly.

And the man beside her.

Avery.

His lungs constricted. This wasn't her choice. Emeric's doing.

Yet the sight carved a hole in his chest.

Somewhere, a starting pistol fired. But Thaddeus was already running—against time, against fate, against the invisible chains tightening around them all.
###Chapter 442

The Morris family's arrival sent ripples through the gathering, sharpening the air with unspoken tension.

Frederic and the Fairhaven estate members greeted them warmly. Though both families were affluent, the Fairhavens' hospitality was noticeably warmer than their usual polite indifference toward others.

Only Thaddeus remained aloof, his sculpted features impassive as he sat beside Frederic. His gaze, heavy with unspoken longing, never wavered from the woman who held his heart captive.

At that moment, Emeric was murmuring something to his daughter Evadne, their heads bent close in serious discussion. The young woman listened intently, oblivious to the scorching intensity of the stare that threatened to burn through her.

Then, like a storm cloud passing overhead, Thaddeus's expression darkened.

Avery had just lifted his champagne flute, leaning forward—deliberately blocking Thaddeus's line of sight.

A second later, Avery turned to face him, a taunting smirk playing on his lips as he raised his glass in a mocking toast.

Thaddeus's blood turned to ice. Shadows deepened across his face as his fingers tightened around the stem of his wine glass, threatening to snap it.

Avery arched a brow, taking a leisurely sip, his entire demeanor dripping with provocation.

CRACK.

The stem shattered in Thaddeus's grip, champagne splashing onto his clothes.

"Oh no! Thad, you've ruined your shirt!" Edith, ever attentive to him, sprang up like a jack-in-the-box and rushed to his side.

Then, to the shock of everyone present, she knelt and began dabbing at the wet spots on his trousers with her handkerchief.

The crowd fell silent.

This was beyond inappropriate. The Fairhaven heiress, debasing herself like this?

Barry and Mrs. Fairhaven turned ashen with fury. Gary, witnessing his niece's humiliation, didn’t seem ashamed—if anything, he looked amused, barely suppressing a chuckle.

Jareth caught that chuckle, his striking eyes narrowing.

But he didn’t intervene. In his mind, Thaddeus should let Edith make a fool of herself. Maybe then she’d learn not to chase after a man who wasn’t hers.

"Jareth." Mari tugged at his sleeve softly.

"Hmm?" He glanced down at her, voice gentle.

"I don’t know why, but looking at your uncle Gary makes me uncomfortable," Mari admitted, too honest to hide her thoughts.

Though she spoke quietly, Gary’s sharp ears caught fragments of the conversation.

"Then don’t look at him," Jareth said, deliberately raising his voice as he wrapped an arm around his petite wife’s waist. "Too much trash can hurt your eyes."

Gary stiffened, anger simmering beneath his forced smile.

Mari obediently shut her eyes, her expression adorably earnest.

Jareth ruffled her hair affectionately before pressing a kiss to her cheek. "In the future, we’ll have beautiful children. Too much trash might affect their looks."

Mari blushed, her cheeks blooming pink.

Gary choked on his drink, his face turning an ugly shade of red.

Evadne watched Edith’s shameless advances and felt fury coil in her chest. She leaned forward slightly—

Not that she’d actually make a scene. She wasn’t that desperate.

But her body moved on instinct.

"Evadne," Emeric’s stern voice cut through her thoughts. "You’re not planning to imitate Edith, are you? Making a spectacle of yourself over a man like some common brawler? Don’t disgrace the Ashbourne name."

Evadne bit her lip hard, the pressure turning her rosy lips white.

Avery overheard, his lips curling darkly as he sipped his champagne.

Just as Edith’s fingers nearly brushed Thaddeus, he stood abruptly, an icy aura radiating from him.

"Ah!" Edith stumbled, landing ungracefully on the floor.

Bodyguards rushed to help her up. Those who hadn’t noticed before certainly did now. Edith’s humiliation was complete.

"Ms. Fairhaven," Thaddeus said coldly, his voice like a blade, "conduct yourself with dignity."

Evadne smiled secretly, warmth blooming in her chest.

No other man in the world could make her feel this secure.

The crowd struggled to suppress their laughter, making Edith’s embarrassment burn hotter.

Barry was furious but couldn’t confront Thaddeus—not when his granddaughter had thrown herself at the man in front of everyone.

"Tsk. The Fairhavens’ upbringing is truly lacking," Jeff muttered beside Emeric. "If that were my daughter, I’d discipline her daily. Evadne’s grace is unmatched. How can those nouveau riche girls compare?"

"Hmph. Grace? Don’t flatter her. She’s a wild monkey," Emeric scoffed, glancing at his daughter. "Remember how many windows she broke as a child?"

Evadne pouted, annoyed he’d bring up old stories just to tease her.

"Hey! She’s spirited! I’ve always loved that about her," Jeff defended, the epitome of a doting father-in-law. "A few broken windows? If it made her happy, I’d bulldoze the whole house!"

Thaddeus excused himself to change, following Gordon out.

Meanwhile, Elspeth sat curled up, her back hunched, legs clamped together, trembling violently.

Things were dire. The pain was excruciating. Thank God she’d drunk little—otherwise, it would’ve been a disaster.

Evadne had been discreetly observing Elspeth since arriving.

Just as Victor predicted, prolonged events like this were torture for her condition.

A mischievous glint flashed in Evadne’s eyes as she stood, champagne glass in hand.

"Ladies and gentlemen," she began, her voice smooth and commanding, "it’s an honor to celebrate this splendid occasion with you all. Today, I’ve had the privilege of meeting esteemed elders, dear friends, and legends of the corporate world—Mr. Morris and Mr. Ford. A true delight."

With a radiant smile, she raised her glass to William and his son. "A toast to these distinguished gentlemen. Welcome to Elmsworth."

Her lips met the rim of the glass as she drank with effortless elegance.

Among all the women of high society—perhaps in the entire nation—Evadne shone like a pearl in the sea.

From the moment she appeared, Junior Morris had been utterly captivated, unable to tear his gaze away.

"Pfft. Who does she think she is?" Glynnis muttered, sneering. "Acting like the hostess when nobody even knows her!"

Before she could finish, William nodded approvingly, raising his glass in return.

"Alea," he said warmly, "I had no idea you were the daughter of K Group’s chairman. What a pleasant surprise. No need for formalities—we’ve met before."

The crowd gasped.

Frederic’s pupils dilated in shock. Evadne had personal ties to the nation’s top business moguls?

The realization unsettled him.

When she’d married into the Abernathy family, she’d hidden her true identity, never revealing her capabilities—never assisting them.

Now, not only was she causing trouble for the Abernathy Group, but she was also radiant, unafraid to display her brilliance.

Had she been playing them for fools all along?

"Mr. Morris, I’m touched you remember me," Evadne replied graciously.

Ford stared at his father in amazement. "This lady is the renowned jewelry designer Alea? When did you meet her?"

"Two years ago," William explained. "For your mother’s birthday, I commissioned a blue diamond necklace. Miss Alea crafted it herself."

"Oh! The one Mother wears to every important event? She adores it!"

"Exactly."

William turned back to Evadne. "I’m truly grateful."

"The honor is mine," Evadne said, neither arrogant nor falsely modest.

Emeric watched with quiet pride. His daughter, usually wild and untamed, never faltered when it mattered.

Edith and Glynnis seethed as Evadne once again commanded attention, their envy turning their eyes red—but they were powerless.

In the presence of true brilliance, their schemes were dust in the wind.

Caged songbirds could never rival a phoenix.

"Ms. Evadne," Ford boldly approached, his gaze burning with admiration, "our meeting must be fate. Let’s toast to serendipity."

Evadne’s eyes narrowed slightly, a cold laugh echoing in her heart.

Avery’s expression darkened, patience wearing thin. He was about to intercept—

But before he could move, a figure stepped in front of Evadne, shielding her.

Thaddeus.

Avery’s jaw tightened, his gaze icy.

"Thad." Evadne’s heart warmed at the sight of his tall silhouette.

"Fate has gathered us all here—not just you and Ms. Evadne," Thaddeus said smoothly, signaling a waiter for champagne.

He raised his glass, his smile not reaching his eyes. "Ms. Evadne is a lady unaccustomed to strong drink. Mr. Ford, allow me to toast on her behalf."
###Chapter 443

The blatant favoritism was impossible to ignore—a display of partiality so bold it bordered on arrogance.

Thaddeus had eyes only for Evadne. Edith? She might as well have been invisible.

Avery's fists clenched, knuckles whitening, his entire body rigid with suppressed fury.

Why was he always a step behind?

Why did that insufferable bastard always manage to claim the spot beside Evadne?

Ford's smile turned icy, his expression darkening, though he maintained the polished veneer of a gentleman. "There's a saying in your country, Mr. Thaddeus—'cherish the fairer sex.' Your devotion to Ms. Evadne is admirable. Clearly, I've been too forward. Allow me to make amends with a drink."

With that, he drained his glass.

Thaddeus, his gaze unreadable, matched him without hesitation.

The tension in the room eased, replaced by forced laughter.

But Frederic's expression darkened.

"Father, what is Thaddeus thinking? President Morris clearly has his sights set on Evadne. Is he deliberately provoking him?"

Glynnis scoffed from the sidelines. "Sacrificing business over a woman? Hardly the behavior of a competent CEO."

She shot a venomous glance at Evadne. "Beauty has always been a curse. And that one? She's nothing but trouble."

Frederic silenced her with a sharp glare. "Must you always be so crass? Learn some decorum from Mari."

At the table, Evadne raised her glass again, her smile dazzling. "A toast to William and Mr. Ford's esteemed presence! Cheers!"

"Cheers!"

The room followed her lead, the mood lifting—except for Elspeth, who stood stiffly in the corner, her untouched glass trembling in her grip.

"Elspeth," Evadne called, her tone light but edged with challenge. "Not drinking? Is our champagne not to your refined taste?"

Elspeth's face paled, her forced smile brittle.

All eyes turned to her, noting her untouched drink.

The Chambers family exchanged disapproving glances. Bertha smirked. "Elspeth, as the lady of the Abernathy Group, you must be accustomed to finer vintages. Our humble offering must seem lacking."

Elspeth's nails dug into her palms.

Before she could respond, Thaddeus cut in. "Elspeth is hardly a stranger to celebrations. No need for restraint tonight."

Murmurs rippled through the room.

So even after all these years, the Abernathy heir still treated her with such disdain?

Elspeth's breath hitched, her carefully applied makeup failing to mask her fury.

Evadne nudged Thaddeus, her perfume teasing his senses.

His cheeks warmed.

She stifled a laugh.

So easily flustered—yet this same man had held her with the hunger of a starved wolf.

"Elspeth," Frederic warned, his voice low. "Don't spoil the evening."

With a stiff nod, she downed her drink, grimacing as if swallowing poison.

Glynnis winced in sympathy.

Avery watched the exchange, suspicion gnawing at him.

Ford returned to his father's side, scowling.

"Taken with Evadne, have you?" William asked mildly.

"From the moment I saw her," Ford admitted, his gaze lingering on Evadne.

William chuckled. "She's the only one here worthy of you."

Ford's lip curled. "The rest are beneath notice."

"But you have competition," William mused. "Thaddeus and that Chambers boy are both smitten."

Ford scoffed. "The Chambers are irrelevant. As for Thaddeus—strip away the title, and he's just the Abernathys' lapdog. Do you really think he'd choose love over power?"

William's expression sobered. "Regardless, our partnership with the Abernathys is crucial. Don't provoke him—for now."

Ford nodded grudgingly.

Meanwhile, Elspeth, her bladder screaming, bolted for the restroom.

Stalls occupied, she danced in agony.

Finally, one freed up—but too late.

Humiliated, she waited until the room emptied before unleashing her fury on the door.

Then, trembling, she dialed Victor.

It rang endlessly before he answered.

"Elspeth."

"Victor," she gasped, desperation clawing at her throat. "You promised me the medicine today. You won't break your word, will you?"

A dark chuckle. "Miss me that much?"

"Victor, please," she begged, tears spilling. "I need it. I can't—"

What she couldn't say: she needed the relief his "miracle cure" promised.

"After the races," he purred. "Track two's rest area. No one will be there."

"I'll come," she vowed.

The races began with fanfare.

Two events dominated the gala:

First, the Parade of a Hundred Steeds—a display of wealth as elites paraded their prized thoroughbreds.

Second, the races themselves, where fortunes were won and lost in a single bet.

The four families' horses stood ready.

"Emeric," Jeff teased, "how much are you betting on my Cyclone?"

Emeric wrinkled his nose. "That name alone is a bad omen."

Jeff pouted. "It's not Treasure anymore!"

"Cyclone? Does it spin in circles while the others race ahead?"

Laughter erupted.

Evadne rolled her eyes at Emeric's sharp tongue.

"You're no fun," Jeff grumbled.

Cassius stepped in smoothly. "I'll bet on Cyclone. A million, as a show of support."

Jeff beamed.

Emeric snorted. "Just watch him lose his shirt."

"Evadne," Avery asked gently, "who are you betting on?"

She didn't look at him. "I don't gamble."

Undeterred, Avery turned to Emeric. "I'll match President Ashbourne—a million on Wind."

Emeric's smile warmed. "At least someone here has taste."

Evadne and Cassius exchanged icy glances.

"Mind if I join?" Thaddeus strolled over, grinning.

Avery tensed.

Emeric arched a brow. "Feeling lucky, Mr. Thaddeus?"

"Wind caught my eye at Aetheria," Thaddeus said. "A million on him."

Cassius chuckled softly.

Evadne marched over and poked Thaddeus's chest. "Are you insane? Wind and Cyclone are evenly matched. You might as well burn your money."

The room fell silent.

Emeric and Jeff exchanged glances.

Thaddeus's smile softened. "Worried about my finances?"

Her cheeks pinked. "I just hate seeing you lose."

He leaned close, whispering, "If I lose to family, it's money well spent."
###Chapter 444

The air between Isabella and Alexander was thick with unspoken affection. Their silent exchange spoke volumes, a language of love that needed no grand declarations.

Nathaniel's brow furrowed as he exchanged a glance with Dominic, whose expression mirrored his unease.

"Fine, fine," Isabella sighed, turning away to hide her smirk. "Spend your fortune however you like."

Beside them, Harrison seethed, his anger simmering beneath the surface.

Sebastian noticed the way Harrison's face darkened, his lips curling into something sinister—like a predator biding its time.

But Sebastian felt no triumph. Instead, dread coiled in his gut. He knew Harrison was plotting something vile, and his only concern was keeping Isabella safe.

Instinctively, he stepped closer to her, positioning himself like an unshakable shield.

The elite guests placed their bets. Nathaniel didn't choose the Vanderbilt Group's horse or the Sinclair family's prized stallion. Instead, he followed his wife's suggestion and picked a striking white horse—not the strongest contender, but the most beautiful.

His reasoning? Aesthetics mattered.

With a careless flick of his wrist, he wagered two million on horse number fourteen as if it were pocket change. All that mattered was making his wife smile.

"Mr. Lockwood, care to place a bet?" Richard asked, standing beside William and his son with a practiced smile.

"Certainly," William replied, scanning the track through his binoculars. "But horse racing isn't just entertainment—it's an investment. I'm looking for pedigree, quality, and a capable owner. The winner will tell me everything I need to know about their business acumen."

Richard's expression tightened.

Was William scouting for new partners?

The Vanderbilt Group had already secured a deal with the Lockwood Consortium for a massive commercial project next year. But now, it seemed William had other plans.

"As you know," William continued smoothly, "our nation's emblem features a horse. Equestrian sports are beloved here, just as they are in my country. Last month, we decided to collaborate with your financial consortium to establish luxury equestrian-themed hotels in both nations."

Ford chimed in, unable to hide his smugness. "The market research is promising. This concept is untapped in Elmsworth. Introducing it here would be revolutionary."

Their conversation carried, igniting ambition in the room.

Nathaniel and Barry's eyes gleamed with opportunity. Aligning with the Lockwood Consortium could shift the power dynamics in Elmsworth—no longer would the Vanderbilt Group reign unchallenged.

Richard's pulse quickened.

He resented William's apparent reluctance to prioritize their existing partnership, but he understood the strategy. Diversification was key.

"Mr. Lockwood," Richard said confidently, "the Vanderbilt Group owns the most prestigious racecourses in Elmsworth. When it comes to equestrian facilities, no one rivals our experience."

Barry scoffed under his breath.

"Let's not exaggerate," Nathaniel interjected. "The Sinclair Group is hosting today's event at the largest racecourse in Elmsworth. That speaks for itself."

Richard remained unruffled. "You built yours later. The Vanderbilt Group was unmatched in its prime."

Nathaniel smirked. "The Kingsley Group's racecourse in Skyrim has been operational for thirty years. Their thoroughbreds are imported, their stables unparalleled. Horse quality? Not even a question."

His words were laced with disdain, a direct jab at Richard.

Barry, sensing an opening, stepped forward. "The Fairhaven Group has its own stables. Our entry today, Lucky Number Eight, is a champion."

Securing a deal with the Lockwood Consortium would elevate Barry's standing—and crush Nathaniel's influence once and for all.

Tension crackled between the three tycoons.

"Your father has remarkable patience," Sebastian murmured to Isabella.

"Tempted by the Lockwood Consortium's offer?" she teased.

"Very."

She nudged him playfully. "If you are, do you think Dominic can resist? Please, the man has four wives. He's hardly above ambition."

Sebastian chuckled at her bluntness.

"He's too used to power," Isabella mused. "People either grovel or his advisors handle negotiations. Pride keeps his hands clean."

"So what now?" Sebastian's voice dropped, his fingers tracing the curve of her waist.

His touch grew bolder, drifting lower—until her heel came down hard on his foot.

"Behave, Mr. Sebastian," she warned, flicking her hair over her shoulder. "Or next time, it'll be a horseshoe."

His gaze darkened. "Then maybe when we get home—"

"Home discussions stay at home," she cut him off, though her pulse betrayed her.

Sebastian sighed. Even affection from his wife required negotiation.

"Gentlemen," William announced, "your expertise is impressive. How about a friendly competition?"

Murmurs rippled through the crowd.

"Each of you has brought a horse for today's derby. The winner earns the Lockwood Consortium's partnership for our new resort project."

The room erupted.

Isabella's mind raced. She wanted that deal.

Sebastian leaned in. "You said Dominic's horse is average. The Vanderbilt and Fairhaven horses are worth millions. Should I arrange a replacement?"

She shook her head. "Too late. And it would insult Dominic. Besides, it's not just the horse—it's the jockey. Ours is a former champion. They'll outperform."

Just then, Mr. Bennett rushed in, his face pale.

"Mr. Dominic! Something terrible has happened!"
###Chapter 445

"What's the matter?" Alexander's voice was low and gravelly.

"Our jockey was attacked by one of the Lockwood family's deranged horses while exercising ours!"

The Sinclair family exchanged horrified glances.

"What?"

Alexander's eyes darkened with concern. "How is he? Please tell me it's not life-threatening."

Though known as a ruthless businessman in the corporate world, Alexander had always treated his staff with kindness. His first thought wasn't about the race—it was about the jockey's safety.

Mr. Donovan, the estate manager, wiped his forehead. "Thankfully, no. He's got multiple bruises and a broken arm. We've sent him to the hospital, but there's no way he can compete now."

Alexander exhaled in relief. "As long as he's alright, that's all that matters."

"Which horse caused the injury? We need to hold them accountable," Isabella reminded gently.

"Don't worry, my dear. The Sinclairs won't be bullied. I've already handled it. They'll face full consequences."

But now, the Sinclairs were in a tight spot.

Without a jockey, were they supposed to withdraw from the competition, handing over victory on a silver platter?

Alexander clenched his jaw, frustration etched across his face.

"Chairman Alexander, what a shame your horse won't compete in such a prestigious event."

Frederick's words dripped with false sympathy, his lips curling into a smug smirk. "But there's always next year. No need to dwell on it."

Alexander's expression darkened.

So your son bullies my daughter, and now you think you can gloat over my misfortune? Over my dead body.

The Chambers and Fairhavens sighed in relief—one less competitor to worry about.

"Regret? Mr. Frederick, don't speak too soon."

Evangeline stepped forward with effortless grace, her tone laced with quiet confidence. "The Sinclairs don't entertain regrets, nor do we accept defeat."

Frederick's smirk faltered.

Evangeline's words shattered the tension, shifting the atmosphere entirely.

Thaddeus watched his fiery love with a soft smile, anticipation burning in his gaze.

That little troublemaker is at it again, Giselle muttered under her breath.

"Hmph, she's just putting on a show because she can't stand losing," Edith scoffed, twirling a strand of hair. "What can she possibly do? The race starts soon. Unless she plans to ride herself—ha!"

Before Edith's laughter faded, Evangeline spoke calmly, "Dad, let me ride for the Sinclairs."

The room erupted in gasps.

What did she just say?

Was Evangeline seriously going to race? Could she even handle it?

Thaddeus's breath hitched as he stared at her, his pulse racing.

Edith's eyes nearly bulged out of her skull.

Giselle smirked. "Oh, look who predicted it perfectly."

"Let her play the hero. We'll see how far she gets," Edith hissed, venom dripping from her words.

"Evangeline, are you sure about this?" Alexander asked, concern lacing his voice.

"Dad, do you really have to ask?" Evangeline winked playfully, mischief dancing in her eyes.

Alexander, Isabella, and Cassius exchanged glances. They knew Evangeline could ride, but racing was an entirely different beast.

"Ms. Evangeline, racing isn't child's play," Barry said dismissively. "This event is crucial for business alliances and family honor."

Clearly, they expected her to fail spectacularly.

"And look around, Ms. Evangeline—do you see any other women competing? Is it really appropriate for you to participate?" Edith sneered, emboldened by her grandfather's words.

"Ms. Edith, are you implying horse riding isn't a sport for women, or do you inherently believe women are inferior to men?" Evangeline's gaze turned icy, her lips curving into a mocking smile. "If I recall correctly, your grandmother was a celebrated equestrian in her youth, even winning international titles. Are you saying her actions were improper, or do you look down on your own family?"

Edith's face flushed crimson, her mouth opening and closing like a fish.

Barry merely sighed at his granddaughter's impulsiveness.

"Um, Julian."

Marianne clutched Julian's hand nervously. "Evangeline just offended Edith. Isn't she afraid?"

"Afraid? Why should she be?" Julian chuckled, squeezing her hand. "When the formidable Thaddeus bends over backward for her, what is there to fear?"

"No, I didn't mean that."

The Sinclairs were about to witness another defining moment—one that might just turn the tables in their favor. Marianne kept her gaze lowered, her lips parting slightly as she whispered, "I'm worried. Worried Edith will target her."

"Did you say something?" Julian asked, not catching her words.

"Nothing! It's nothing." She shook her head frantically.

Fragmented, nightmarish memories flooded her mind. She took a deep breath, forcing them away, though a sheen of cold sweat formed on her brow.

"You don't enter a battle unprepared," Evangeline said, flashing Barry a confident smile. "Mr. Barry, thank you for your concern, but I never fight a battle I'm not certain of winning. This competition is mine for the taking!"

Barry was taken aback, his opinion of her shifting instantly.

Her fearlessness reminded him of his late wife in her youth.

If Edith weren't his granddaughter, he'd have to admit—this girl was a force to be reckoned with.

If my grandson courted her...

Now that was a thought worth considering.

"Dad, Isabella, Cassius—I'm running out of time. I'll go change," Evangeline announced cheerfully before striding out with Mr. Donovan.

"Evangeline! Be careful!" Isabella called after her, worry brimming in her eyes.

Evangeline turned back and flashed an "okay" sign.

"Let the girl try," Alexander said, masking his concern with nonchalance.

Thaddeus's burning gaze followed her until she disappeared from sight.

"Surprised? Didn't expect Evangeline to be an equestrian?"

Avery approached with a smirk, standing beside him like a scene from a painting.

Yet beneath the surface, these two were mortal enemies, each wishing the other would vanish.

"Evangeline is a gift from God," Thaddeus said, his voice deep. "And gifts, as you know, are full of surprises."

"Spare me the theatrics," Avery retorted coldly. "It's clear you don't understand her. Why mask your insecurity with noble words?"

Thaddeus's fingers curled into fists.

"Did you ever let Evangeline see the real you, Avery?" He laughed darkly. "Did she ever see the ruthless man who conspired with Eden and sent assassins to Star Industries, plotting her brother's demise?"

"Don't provoke me, Thaddeus," Avery warned, his smile chilling. "I can make you beg for tears that won't come."

Thaddeus smirked, unfazed. "I'd love to see you try, you rabid dog."

Edith downed three glasses of champagne, but the fire in her chest refused to die.

Alone in the lounge corridor, she pulled out a cigarette case, her movements practiced.

"Brooding with smoke and drink? Look what Evangeline's reduced you to," Giselle mocked, sauntering in.

"Bullied? As if she could bully me!" Edith snapped, taking a furious drag.

Giselle rolled her eyes but lit her own cigarette.

"No matter how much that wench shows off, Thaddeus is mine. And the title of Mrs. Abernathy will belong to me!"

Giselle barely suppressed an eye-roll.

After a pause, she fanned the flames. "Even if you marry him, it won't be easy. He's clearly obsessed with her. You'll be ditched in no time."

Ditched?

Edith's mind conjured humiliating scenarios.

"We need to stop this before it starts!"

"Oh? The Fairhaven family's tricks might work on others, but Evangeline's backed by power. You think you can touch her?"

Giselle crushed her cigarette. "I heard Evangeline was a youth equestrian champion. She'll steal the spotlight again. We're doomed to stay in her shadow."

Edith's expression darkened.

"Who says there's no chance? Today's the perfect opportunity." Her eyes gleamed with malice. "I'll make sure she doesn't return in one piece."

"What's your plan?" Giselle leaned in eagerly.

"This race isn't just about pride—it's about business. I won't just humiliate her. I'll make sure the K Group loses this deal."

The Fairhavens had their own stables. Edith knew horses.

"If we want Evangeline to fall, her horse must fail first."

Giselle shuddered. Edith's schemes were as bold as they were vile.

Half an hour later, as the derby's final call approached, competitors scrambled with last-minute preparations.

Evangeline led out her sleek black mare, Breeze, whose coat gleamed under the sun. She stroked the mare's mane gently, but Breeze seemed off—breathing heavily, her usual fiery spirit dampened.

"What's wrong with Breeze? Is she sick?" Evangeline asked, concerned.

The trainer sighed. "Miss, Breeze is the gentlest filly in our stable. She's grieving for our jockey. Her spirit isn't at its peak."

"A heart of gold—more reliable than most men," Evangeline murmured, touched.

She leaned close, whispering tenderly into Breeze's ear. "My dear, I know you're not yourself today. But your friend trained for months for this. You wouldn't want to disappoint him, would you?"

After a few more soft words, Breeze's demeanor shifted. Her head lifted, spirit reignited.

With effortless grace, Evangeline mounted her, radiating regal confidence.

The trainer marveled. She looked like a warrior queen—untouchable, commanding.

Evangeline tightened the reins. Breeze reared slightly.

"Forward! To battle we ride!"
###Chapter 446

The arena buzzed with electric energy as the final countdown began.

Jockeys mounted their powerful steeds, making a dazzling entrance under the floodlights.

Rose petals rained down like crimson snow as the crowd erupted in thunderous applause. Each rider stood tall—warriors ready for battle.

The announcer's voice boomed through the speakers, introducing each competitor and their prized horses. Spectators cheered for their favorites, but a hushed anticipation lingered for one particular rider.

"And now, ladies and gentlemen!"

The announcer paused dramatically, scanning his notes. The crowd held its breath.

"Please welcome the daughter of Chairman Emeric Ashbourne—Ms. Evadne Ashbourne!"

Gasps rippled through the stands. The Ashbourne heiress herself was competing? Could this society darling truly hold her own in such a brutal sport?

Jewelry designer. Hotel tycoon. Fashion icon. Esteemed doctor. And now—a jockey? What other hidden talents did she possess?

But not everyone was impressed.

"Can't the Ashbournes afford a professional rider? Sending their precious gem to get dirty—how desperate for attention."

"Honestly, the track is filthy. I'd never set foot there."

"And horses? They're unpredictable beasts. What if one throws her? Tramples her? Seems the Ashbournes will do anything for a headline."

Evadne strode into the arena, leading her stallion, Wind, with effortless grace.

The murmurs died instantly.

Dressed in sleek black and white riding gear, she was a vision—her lithe frame accentuated by the tailored outfit, her confidence radiating like sunlight.

Her sharp eyes gleamed with determination.

Thaddeus's grip tightened on the railing, his knuckles white. His heart hammered as he watched her, pride and fear warring inside him.

"Evadne," he whispered, voice thick with emotion.

Edith rolled her eyes and took a long swig of bourbon.

Stare all you want. Maybe this is the last time you'll see her.

Frederic scowled, irritated by his usually composed son's obvious infatuation. He turned to Glynnis instead.

"Where's your mother? The race is starting, and she's nowhere to be found."

Glynnis bristled. "How should I know? She's your wife."

Frederic's frown deepened. Elspeth had been acting strangely lately—secretive, distant. It wasn't like her.

"Dennis."

"Yes, Mr. Abernathy."

"Find my wife. Tell her to return immediately."

Dennis nodded and hurried off.

Glynnis's stomach twisted. What if Mother's meeting Victor right now? Panicked, she fired off a warning text.

[Mom! Dad's looking for you. Be careful!]

Meanwhile, Jareth whooped loudly as Evadne took her position.

"Go, Evadne! You look incredible! Show them what you've got!"

Mari, beside him, didn't seem annoyed. Instead, her eyes sparkled with excitement, her fists clenched in anticipation.

The Fairhavens pretended not to know him.

Thaddeus shot Jareth a glare. "Must you act like a baboon?"

"Come on, I'm just hyping her up!" Jareth grinned. "If Mari were racing, I'd be sprinting alongside her, cheering my lungs out!"

Thaddeus scoffed. As if you wouldn't.

"You're too uptight, man." Jareth nudged him. "I know you're dying to cheer for her too. Why hold back?"

Thaddeus smirked. "Oh, I'll show her. Just not here."

Jareth waggled his eyebrows. "Ah, private celebrations. Got it."

The race was about to begin.

The horses lined up, muscles coiled, ready to explode forward. The crowd leaned in, breathless.

Ford Morris adjusted his binoculars, his gaze lingering on Evadne's figure. A slow smirk curled his lips.

Perfect.

Myra Ashbourne noticed his stare and tensed. "Cassius, that Morris boy is eyeing Evadne."

Cassius's jaw tightened. "I saw."

"What if he proposes an alliance through marriage? You know how Father feels about expanding overseas."

"Father would never agree," Cassius said firmly. "Ford's nearly forty—Evadne deserves better."

But doubt gnawed at him.

Emeric, oblivious, beamed as he snapped photos of his daughter.

Evadne focused ahead, her grip steady on the reins.

The starting gun fired.

Fourteen horses surged forward like arrows loosed from a bow. Wind shot ahead, his powerful strides eating up the track.

The crowd roared.

Thaddeus's pulse raced as he watched Evadne streak across the field, her form flawless, her determination unshakable.

You've got this.

Wind blazed ahead, but Thunder—Barry Fairhaven's prized stallion—soon overtook them.

Barry whooped, slamming his cane on the ground. "That's my boy! Thunder's unstoppable!"

Gary, ever the sycophant, chimed in. "Your judgment was impeccable, sir!"

Jareth sneered. "Kiss-up."

Avery adjusted his glasses, unfazed. "It's early yet, Mr. Fairhaven. Celebrating now is premature."

Gary smirked. "Oh, I get it. You're rooting for Ms. Ashbourne—because you're in love with her."

Avery's jaw clenched.

Jareth cackled. "Look at his face! Priceless!"

Thaddeus ignored them, his eyes locked on Evadne.

The race intensified.

Thunder led, Wind close behind, with Dragon—Abernathy's entry—nipping at their heels.

A burly jockey from Fairhaven sneered as he passed Evadne. "Nice try, princess."

Evadne's eyes flashed.

I'll win this—or never ride again.

She urged Wind faster, closing the gap.

Below, Edith watched, her lips curving into a sinister smile.

Let's see how long you last.
###Chapter 447

An hour earlier, Isabella had discreetly pulled Preston aside—one of Harrison's most loyal aides—into a shadowed alcove, their heads bent in hushed conspiracy.

"Preston, you've served our family since my grandfather's time. You're practically part of the Sinclair legacy." Isabella's eyes glistened with unshed tears, her expression the picture of vulnerability.

"Of course, Miss Sinclair. I watched you grow up. My loyalty to the Sinclair family is absolute." Preston's voice was steady, but concern etched deep lines into his weathered face. "Tell me, what troubles you? You look unwell."

Isabella spun a web of deceit, painting herself as the victim of Arabella's ruthless schemes. "And now," she choked out between sobs, "she's trying to steal my fiancé!"

Her cries were heartrending. "Nathaniel and I were about to announce our engagement. Then Arabella swooped in and took him from me. If I don't secure this marriage, I'll be the laughingstock of all New York! How can I ever show my face again? I might as well—"

"Don't say it, Miss Sinclair!" Preston, who had no children of his own, saw Isabella and her brother as his own flesh and blood. His anger flared at the injustice. "Arabella is vile! To think she'd target the man you love. She has no shame!"

"Is there... anything we can do to ensure she loses?" Isabella's tears masked the venom in her voice. "She must fail in this equestrian contest. She can't be allowed to win the project for Sinclair Holdings—or keep Nathaniel."

She knew Preston was sharp and unafraid of dirty tactics. He would grasp the unspoken implication.

But she couldn't risk saying it outright. Some schemes were best left unsaid, lest they become weapons against her. Trust was a luxury she couldn’t afford.

Preston paced before stopping abruptly, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "To guarantee her loss, we'll need to sabotage her horse."

"How?"

"Racehorses run on pure instinct. Once they're in motion, they won't stop—even if injured—until they collapse." A grim smile twisted his lips. "I have an idea. If luck isn't on her side, Arabella might not walk away from this race."

The final stretch of the race had arrived.

Only three contenders remained: Sinclair Holdings, Vanderbilt Group, and Kingsley Enterprises.

The Chambers Group's horse, Tempest, had already fallen hopelessly behind, sealing their defeat.

"Damn it!" Harrison slammed his fist against the railing, his chance at a partnership with J Group slipping through his fingers. "I treated that horse like royalty, and this is how it repays me? From now on, you're nothing but 'Mudpie' to me!"

The crowd snickered at his outburst.

"Mr. Sinclair's Wind is truly exceptional," Adrian remarked, seizing the moment to ingratiate himself. "Arabella claimed Tempest was in the same league, but the difference is night and day. Father, we should consult Mr. Sinclair on selecting racehorses. Next time, we'll surpass them."

His flattery was shameless, but Harrison didn’t mind—the timing was perfect.

William smiled warmly at Adrian. "Your father has never taken my advice in his life. I'll eat my hat if he starts now. But it's not just Wind's talent—Arabella's skill as a rider is unmatched."

"Arabella is truly perfect," Adrian murmured, his gaze lingering on the striking figure galloping down the track.

"That bastard's bootlicking makes me sick!" Sebastian clenched his fists, watching Adrian butter up William. "Hey, if you don’t step up, she’ll be snatched away! Get in there and sweet-talk them!"

"I'm not good at that," Nathaniel muttered, his heart racing as he watched Arabella, his focus entirely on her.

"You can learn! Take me as your mentor. I'll teach you everything!" Sebastian nudged him with a grin.

"Sebastian, something feels off," Nathaniel said, loosening his tie, an inexplicable dread settling in his chest.

"Same. Watching that sycophant makes me want to puke," Sebastian gagged theatrically.

"No. I think something bad is about to happen."

Nathaniel's eyes darkened with unease. Whether it was intuition or fear, he couldn’t shake the oppressive weight pressing down on him.

Arabella, win or lose—just come back to me safely. That’s all that matters.

"Adrian is cozying up to the Sinclairs. William seems taken with him," Margaret whispered to Lawrence, her face tight with worry. "What if William actually considers giving Arabella to Adrian? If that snake marries into the Sinclair family, he’ll have their backing to seize control of Chambers Group! With me married off and Nathaniel sidelined, you’ll have no support. Vanderbilt Group could threaten your position as CEO!"

"Enough," Lawrence cut in, his voice icy. "Worrying now is pointless. Arabella isn’t some obedient puppet. She married into the Abernathy family behind William’s back—you really think she’ll bend to her parents’ whims?"

"Still—"

"And honestly," Lawrence continued, a dark smirk curling his lips, "I’d love to see William try to force her into marrying Adrian. The chaos would be spectacular."

Arabella’s brow glistened with sweat as she urged Wind forward, her speed breathtaking.

"Wind! Go, boy!"

The stallion surged ahead like a tempest, leaving Dragon far behind in seconds.

The rival jockey whipped his horse mercilessly, his glare venomous as Arabella pulled ahead.

Her jaw tightened, her competitive fire blazing. Then—Wind faltered. His breathing turned ragged.

Arabella’s stomach dropped. Something was wrong with his legs.

"Wind! Stop! Don’t run!" She yanked the reins hard.

The race didn’t matter—she wouldn’t let Wind get hurt.

But the usually obedient stallion ignored her, lost in the frenzy of the race, his will to win overpowering even her commands.

"Wind! I said stop!" She strained against him, but it was useless.

The finish line loomed. The crowd held its breath. Even William and his son leaned forward, anticipation etched on their faces.

"Something’s not right!" Nathaniel’s pupils contracted. Whether it was instinct or the panic on Arabella’s face, he knew—he knew. He dropped his binoculars and sprinted toward the track.

"Wait! Where are you going?" Sebastian shouted, torn between following and staying with Lillian.

Adrian’s eyes darkened. "Harvey, find out what’s happening."

Only meters remained. Sinclair Holdings was inches from victory.

Harrison trembled with excitement. Lawrence had already approached William, hand outstretched for congratulations.

Then—

A thunderous roar erupted from the crowd.

"Number five crosses first! Congratulations to K Group—Arabella Sinclair takes the win!"

William and the Sinclairs erupted into cheers.

"Arabella! You’re incredible!" Even the usually reserved Eleanor screamed in joy. Oliver clapped until his palms burned.

Harrison’s face went slack, his dreams crumbling. Lawrence, mid-handshake, looked like a fool.

"I suppose this is unnecessary now?" William arched a brow, arms crossed.

Lawrence could only offer a defeated smile, retreating in humiliation.

Then—gasps of horror.

"Oh my God! Arabella and her horse—they’ve fallen!" Isabella shot to her feet, pointing at the track, her eyes alight with triumph.

Dust billowed as Wind collapsed, sliding before crashing to the ground with a pained whinny. Arabella was thrown, slamming through a barrier.

"Arabella!"

The Sinclairs froze in terror. William nearly fainted, steadied only by Eleanor. Oliver and Mr. Bennett were the first to reach Arabella.

"Arabella, Arabella!" Lillian covered her mouth, tears streaming.

"Don’t cry, Lillian! She’ll be okay!" Sebastian pulled his wife close, comforting her even as his sharp gaze locked onto Isabella’s smug smirk.

Something wasn’t right.

Arabella’s fall had been sudden, yet Isabella had been the first to notice—as if she’d expected it.

Arabella’s back screamed in agony, the metal barrier digging into her waist. She gasped for air, the world spinning.

Faintly, she heard running footsteps, a desperate voice calling her name.

Was it the medics? Her father? Her brothers?

"Arabella!"

Then—strong arms wrapped around her, pulling her into a familiar embrace. The scent of him cleared the fog in her mind.

She looked up slowly, meeting Nathaniel’s bloodshot eyes, filled with tears.

A weak smile curved her lips.

"Hey... it’s you."
###Chapter 448

"It's me. Isabella, it's me." Nathaniel's voice was rough with emotion, his arms tightening around her trembling form as if she might vanish into thin air if he loosened his grip for even a second. His heart shattered at the sight of her pain. "Isabella, tell me where it hurts. Please, just tell me!"

"Storm!"

The moment her thoughts cleared, Isabella's first concern was for the injured horse. She struggled free from Nathaniel's embrace, scrambling toward Storm, who lay on the ground, gasping for breath.

"Isabella! Come back!"

Nathaniel's desperate cry echoed behind her, his chest constricting as he followed.

Medics, Sebastian, and Mr. Langley had arrived, but none could stop Isabella, her eyes burning with fierce determination.

Below, the crowd gaped in shock at the sight of Nathaniel—normally so composed—racing onto the track to hold a frantic Isabella. "Good God, is that really Nathaniel Kingsley? I've never seen him like this!"

"Who knew the unshakable Nathaniel could be brought to his knees like this? Only Isabella has that power."

"Ugh, I'm so jealous! I wish he'd hold me like that!"

"But seriously, if he loves her this much, why did they divorce in the first place?"

"Wait—do you think Victoria and Arabella plotted against him, making Isabella misunderstand? Now that the truth's out, are they getting back together?"

The whispers swirled like a storm, but one thing was undeniable—Nathaniel's love for Isabella ran deep, thawing like spring waters, flowing unrestrained toward the only woman who had ever truly held his heart.

"Hey, this was your doing, wasn't it?" Giselle murmured slyly to Edith.

Edith's eyes burned with venom as she glared at Isabella, now being cradled protectively by Nathaniel. "What nonsense are you spouting? She brought this on herself! It has nothing to do with me!"

"You think your little scheme might backfire?" Giselle smirked. "Not only is Isabella unharmed, but now the whole world has seen how much Nathaniel adores her. Thanks to you, they might be even more inseparable."

"Shut your mouth!"

Edith's icy gaze locked onto Giselle, her cheeks flushed with fury. "Mock me again, and I'll make sure you fall harder than Isabella did. Don't test me. The Fairhavens don't play fair."

Giselle clenched her jaw, but fear prickled down her spine.

Her standing in the family had crumbled—unwanted, ignored. But Edith? She was the Fairhaven heiress, Barry's beloved granddaughter. Crossing her would be a fatal mistake.

"Isabella! Stop. We need to get you to the hospital!" Sebastian's voice cracked with urgency, but even he and Nathaniel—two powerful men—were helpless against her stubborn will.

"I'm a surgeon. I know my own body better than any of you!"

Ignoring the pain, Isabella knelt beside Storm, her tears falling freely as she gently touched his weakening form. "Storm, why did you push yourself like this? I told you to stop! Why didn't you listen?"

Nathaniel stood rigid beside her, watching as she fretted over the horse, his own heart aching. Her kindness ran bone-deep, and he loved her fiercely for it.

The horse trainer arrived swiftly, examining Storm alongside Isabella.

Soon, they found the problem—a long, narrow gash sliced into Storm's left leg, hidden beneath his dark fur.

One look confirmed it—sabotage.

Normally, such a wound could be treated, but after a brutal race, the injury had worsened, pus mixing with blood, flesh torn to the bone. The situation was dire.

"Explain this to me!" Isabella's voice trembled with barely contained rage.

"Ms. Sinclair, I swear I didn't know! Storm was fine before the race—I checked him myself!" The trainer was near tears, horrified. "How did this happen?"

"Isabella, Gene's been with us for years. He's meticulous. If someone targeted Storm, we wouldn't have seen it coming," Sebastian said, his voice steadying.

Isabella took a shuddering breath, her body shaking with fury.

Nathaniel knelt behind her, wrapping his arms around her shoulders, pulling her into his chest. "Isabella, someone slipped into the stables and cut Storm before the race. Leave it to me. I'll find who did this."

Her heart swelled. He wasn't doing this for her—he was doing it for Storm.

That meant everything.

"The culprit knows horses," Isabella said coldly. "This cut was precise—too shallow, and it wouldn't have done damage. Too deep, and I'd have noticed before the race."

"But the track is full of horse enthusiasts. Where do we start?" Mr. Langley frowned.

"Two motives," Nathaniel said darkly. "One—hurt Isabella. So we look at her enemies. Two—sabotage the Sinclair horse to secure a win."

His hand rested protectively on Isabella's back, his gaze chilling.

The suspects? All here.

At that moment, Adrian arrived in a rush, followed by Harvey and Elmsworth's top medics.

"Gene, Mr. Lyle—make sure Storm is comfortable. I'm operating on him myself," Isabella said, standing with Nathaniel's help. "And I need a brace for my waist. That's all."

"After this, I'm taking care of you," Nathaniel murmured, his voice rough with emotion.

They walked past Adrian without a glance, as if he were invisible. The snub cut deeper than any blade.

"Isabella! Isabella!"

No matter how Adrian called, she never looked back.

"Mr. Chambers, it's clear Isabella doesn't want you," Sebastian said coldly as he passed. "The man she needs has always been Nathaniel. With him, she needs no one else."

Adrian's face drained of color.

In the infirmary, Isabella undressed, revealing bruises in violent shades across her skin.

Nathaniel's breath hitched, his fists clenching and unclenching.

"Hurry. We have work to do," she said softly.

Gritting his teeth, he secured the brace around her waist, bandaging her wounds in silence.

When he finished, he couldn't hold back—he pulled her into his arms from behind.

"Hey," she muttered, annoyed but not pushing him away.

Tears burned his eyes, falling onto her skin.

After a moment, Nathaniel's voice was raw. "Whoever dares touch the woman I love is a dead man."

Isabella scoffed, but her fingers gently brushed through his hair. "I know you're angry. So am I."

Tension thickened the air.

Though the K Group's horse had won, the tragedy made business discussions inappropriate.

After handling Isabella's affairs, Sebastian returned, his expression grim. Before Emeric and Myra could speak, Preston rushed forward. "President Sinclair, how is Ms. Sinclair? Is she badly hurt?"

"Thank you for your concern. My sister will recover. Nathaniel is with her now," Sebastian said, his smile not reaching his eyes.

Hearing Nathaniel's name, Preston's face darkened.

"Thank God," William murmured, crossing himself.

Emeric, pale-faced, stood with Myra's support, desperate to see his daughter.

Suddenly, Gregory frowned. "What about the horse? How is it?"

Silence fell.

"Mr. Fairhaven, I've heard Storm is in critical condition. The Sinclairs' trainers missed the injury. The horse barely finished the race before collapsing. A tragedy," the secretary said smoothly.

"And the leg?" Edith asked, feigning concern.

"Shattered. They'll likely euthanize it."

"Oh, how awful!" Edith gasped, crocodile tears in her eyes—though beneath her hand, she smirked.

"Euthanize? Storm isn't terminally ill!" Myra protested.

"Myra, you don't understand," Gregory said, playing the expert. "The injury is too severe. Even if they amputate, survival is unlikely. And a champion like Storm? A life without racing is worse than death."

"Humane? Killing instead of healing—that's your idea of mercy?" Jareth's voice was ice.

Edith, ever the actress, burst into tears. "Isabella knows horses. She should've felt Storm's injury when she mounted him, right?"

"Good God! If that's true, Ms. Sinclair is heartless!" Giselle seized the moment. "Sacrificing an innocent life for a trophy? Disgusting! Mr. Morris, can you condone this?"

William's brow furrowed.

"Gregory, for someone who barely rides, you're suddenly an expert," came a cold voice.

Everyone turned.

Isabella stood there, shoulder-to-shoulder with Nathaniel, her smile chilling.
###Chapter 449

The crowd's piercing stares made Gary squirm, his face burning with humiliation.

"Myra's voice trembled with emotion, tears glistening in her eyes. "Evadne! You're safe—thank heavens!"

Emeric, usually unshakable in business negotiations, exhaled in relief at the sight of his unharmed daughter. His tailored suit clung to him, damp with cold sweat—a rare crack in his composed facade.

His gaze shifted to Thaddeus, who stood resolutely beside Evadne. The Abernathy Group president, whose every move was scrutinized, seemed indifferent to the risks. To him, Evadne mattered more than any crown.

For a fleeting moment, Emeric thought of Evadne's mother. He, too, had once been willing to sacrifice everything for love.

Yet life had taken a different path.

Now, society labeled him a playboy, heartless and disloyal. Rumors claimed his first wife died of heartbreak.

But only one person had ever truly understood him.

"Ms. Ashbourne, was I mistaken?" Gary's smirk held a venomous edge.

"You weren't wrong. The problem is, those poor creatures never had the chance to meet me."

Evadne's eyes sparkled with defiance. Despite her injuries, her smile remained radiant—confident, captivating.

"My hands can heal even the dying."

Murmurs rippled through the crowd. Such a bold claim would sound like arrogance from anyone else. But Evadne carried it with effortless charm, making people wonder what miracles she might conjure next.

Ford arched a brow, amused. "Quite the tall tale, isn't it?"

Glynnis crossed her arms, her sneer twisting her features. "You killed the horse yourself, and now you're spinning lies to deceive Mr. William Morris and his son?"

From behind her grandfather, Edith stifled a laugh. Evadne had nearly broken herself—and that million-dollar horse was finished. The Ashbourne Group project was lost, and now she'd earned William's scorn.

Perfect.

"Evadne treated Wind's injury."

Thaddeus's sharp tone made Glynnis flinch. "Dr. Chasel Bright provided his family's latest anti-inflammatory medication. It worked—on both humans and animals. Wind's infection was contained, and his life saved."

Cassius allowed himself a faint smile, recalling the tall figure in the white coat—the gentle gaze that lingered.

Meanwhile, Chasel was at home, furiously tapping his phone screen. His wallpaper? Cassius's striking profile.

"Damn it! He only calls when he needs something!"

The crowd gaped, their disbelief palpable.

"Mr. Abernathy, you're saying Evadne reattached a horse's leg?" Jeff's eyes bulged. "Is that even possible?"

"Of course, Mr. Chambers. Have you forgotten Evadne's other identity?"

Jareth's grin widened. "She's the renowned 'Dr. Eve.' Surely you knew?"

Evadne resisted the urge to roll her eyes. Why not declare her ruler of the universe while they were at it?

"Ah, yes!" Jeff smacked his forehead. "Evadne operated on my son Byron's leg after his accident. She's a miracle worker!"

Evadne sighed. This was exactly why she avoided revealing her identity—the endless chatter, the unwanted attention.

"Ms. Ashbourne is Dr. Eve?" William's eyes narrowed. The name carried weight—how could he not know?

"Mr. William Morris."

Evadne approached him, bowing respectfully. "Wind was injured before the race. I failed to notice in time, and pushing him worsened the wound. Though I've treated him, he'll never race again."

Her voice cracked.

Thaddeus's chest tightened. He knew her physical pain paled compared to her grief.

"What's the point now?" Glynnis scoffed. "A racehorse that can't run—that's crueler than putting it down."

"Mind your words," Frederic snapped.

Glynnis pursed her lips, silenced.

"Ms. Ashbourne, how did Wind get hurt?" Ford seized the moment.

All eyes turned to Evadne.

Edith, outwardly calm, clenched her fists.

Thaddeus didn't answer immediately. Instead, he stepped forward, wrapping an arm around Evadne's waist to steady her.

She trembled, her face pale, sweat beading her forehead. The fearless woman now leaned into him, fragile as a wounded kitten.

Ford frowned.

Just then, Avery approached, his heart splintering at the sight. The pain was unbearable—like a thousand arrows piercing his soul.

"Mr. Avery Chambers! Are you alright?" Harvey moved to support him but was shoved away.

"Don't touch me!"

Harvey retreated, his glare fixed on Thaddeus. He'd never resent Avery—only the man who'd shattered his happiness.

"Wind's injury was deliberate—a deep, precise cut." Evadne's voice hardened. "Our horses are worth millions, guarded by specialists. Yet someone still got close enough to harm him."

The crowd murmured. Only Edith stared daggers at Evadne. That cut should've been on her face!

"Ms. Ashbourne is right." Matthew stepped in, eager to deflect blame from the Chambers Group. "This was premeditated. We'll investigate thoroughly."

"My son speaks for me," Jeff agreed. "This is attempted murder!"

At "murder," Edith's heart lurched.

"One thing's clear," Evadne said. "The culprit had access to the stables. That narrows it down to staff, trainers, jockeys—or personal aides."

"Cassius." Emeric's voice was steel.

"Yes, Father."

"Investigate everyone connected to the stables. No exceptions."

Emeric turned to Jeff. "Would Matthew assist?"

"Of course! We'll get to the truth."

Matthew nodded. "I'll help however I can."

Thaddeus's icy voice cut through. "No need. I've already caught the culprit."

Gasps filled the air.

Evadne stared at him, stunned.

"Gordon. Bring them in."

Moments later, Duke was dragged forward—filthy, disheveled, a broken man.

"Duke?!"

The Fairhaven family froze. Edith turned ghostly pale, stumbling back.

An hour earlier, Jareth had pulled Thaddeus aside.

"Edith?" Thaddeus arched a brow.

"If she's innocent, I'll eat my hat," Jareth growled, cigarette trembling in his fingers.

"Spare me the theatrics." Thaddeus pocketed the unlit cigarette. "She's your family. Handle it—or I will. My methods might upset you."

"I think she's involved." Jareth's voice wavered. "But without proof..."

"Love's made you soft."

Jareth sighed. "I've got Mari now. I can't be reckless."

"I'll be the villain." Thaddeus's grip tightened on his shoulder. "Let the wicked destroy each other."
###Chapter 450

The air in the VIP lounge was thick with tension.

Across the racetrack, in the dimly lit confines of rest lounge No. 2, Isabella Sinclair’s pulse raced. The moment the race ended, she couldn’t contain herself. She had to see him.

"Alexander! Alexander, I'm here!"

Ever since she’d met Alexander Kingsley, something inside her had awakened. She wasn’t the same woman who had spent decades playing the perfect wife, suffocating under the weight of her husband’s expectations.

No more.

She had lived a lie for too long, pretending to adore a man she despised. But Alexander—he was different. He was the storm that had drenched her parched soul, and she never wanted to be dry again.

Her fingers trembled as she knocked on the door. When no answer came, impatience won. She pushed inside, locking the door behind her.

Empty.

Her heart dropped. "Where is he?"

Then she saw it—a syringe on the table. Her lifeline. Her salvation.

Just as she reached for it, her phone rang.

Alexander.

"Alexander! Where are you?" Her voice was raw with need.

"Mrs. Sinclair, the track is swarming with eyes. If we were seen together, no amount of charm could save us." His voice was smooth, laced with concern. "I can handle the rumors, but your reputation? That’s priceless."

Tears welled in her eyes. "You’re the only one who truly cares about me. You’re all I have."

"I know you’ve been struggling without your medicine. I left it for you. Consider it a gift."

The call ended, but Isabella didn’t hesitate. She uncapped the needle, her hands shaking, and plunged it into her vein.

A gasp escaped her lips as euphoria flooded her senses. She slid to the floor, a mess of tears and ragged breaths. In that moment, she wasn’t a society queen—she was a slave to the high.

When the haze lifted, she staggered to the mirror. The drug had worked its magic—her skin glowed, her eyes sparkled. But something felt... off.

A sharp knock shattered the silence.

Her heart lurched.

"Mrs. Sinclair, are you in there?"

Dennis.

Her stomach twisted. Thank God Alexander hadn’t been here. How would she have explained this?

She took a deep breath, smoothed her dress, and opened the door with practiced poise.

"What is it?"

"Mr. Sinclair has been looking for you. Everyone’s waiting." His gaze flicked past her, scanning the room.

She crossed her arms, leaning against the doorframe with a mocking smirk. "Looking for something? Go ahead, search. Maybe you’ll find the lover you seem so convinced I’m hiding."

Dennis merely bowed his head. "My apologies, Mrs. Sinclair. Mr. Sinclair insists on your presence."

The grandstand buzzed with tension.

Behind Barry’s imposing figure, Edith stood frozen, her face ashen. Duke had always been untouchable—how had Thaddeus caught him so easily?

The Fairhaven family was in shock.

"Duke? How could it be you?" Barry’s voice cracked.

Duke, his protege, his almost-son, now crumpled on the ground after Gordon’s vicious kick.

"Mr. Fairhaven, I—"

Another kick silenced him.

Evadne tensed. She’d never seen Gordon like this—usually the calm, composed shadow behind Thaddeus, now a storm of fury.

Then Thaddeus’s hand settled on her waist, his voice a whisper. "Did that scare you?"

"Please," she scoffed, though her skin tingled where he touched her. "I’m not the one getting kicked."

His lips curved. "Gordon’s never lost control like this. Not until someone hurt you."

Her breath hitched.

Gordon wasn’t done. He hauled Duke up, his voice deadly. "You filthy rat. You laid hands on Mrs. Abernathy? You have a death wish?"

Gary lunged forward. "How dare a secretary strike a Fairhaven?"

The Fairhaven men surged, but Thaddeus’s voice cut through like ice. "Touch him, and you answer to me."

Silence.

Barry’s face darkened. "Thaddeus, you accuse my man without proof?"

Thaddeus’s smile was razor-sharp. "Proof? Oh, I have plenty."

Duke’s confidence wavered.

Elspeth, finally arriving, shot Thaddeus a venomous look. "This is absurd! The Fairhavens are our allies!"

Jareth snorted. "Allies don’t try to kill my sister-in-law."

Thaddeus’s gaze locked onto Evadne, his voice raw. "I don’t care about alliances. I don’t care about reputation. The only thing that matters—"

His fingers brushed her cheek.

"—is her."

Her heart stuttered.

Jareth muttered under his breath, "Damn, he’s good."

Mari sighed against his chest. "He really loves her."

Jareth kissed her temple. "I’d burn the world for you too, sweetheart."

Mari’s lips pressed together. She wanted to be more than just protected. She wanted to be strong—for him.

Edith’s nails dug into her palms. Evadne had everything. And she had nothing.

Barry’s voice was steel. "Where’s your proof, Thaddeus?"

Thaddeus smirked. "Oh, Duke. You really thought you’d get away with it?"

Duke’s bravado cracked. "I didn’t touch her horse!"

Gordon kicked him again. "Liar."

The Fairhavens bristled, but no one moved.

Thaddeus’s eyes were glacial. "You messed with the wrong woman."

Evadne’s pulse raced.

This wasn’t over. Not even close.
###Chapter 451

Evadne's blood boiled with fury, her fingers curling into tight fists.

That venomous weasel! Twisting facts without shame. He was the one with murderous intent, yet now he dared to smear Thaddeus' name, driving a wedge between him and the Fairhaven Group to secure Barry's unwavering loyalty.

"Thaddeus, this concerns the honor of both our prestigious families. You must treat it seriously!"

Elspeth played her role masterfully, feigning concern while subtly manipulating the situation. "We understand you feel indebted to Ms. Ashbourne since the divorce. Naturally, you'd want to defend her after her... unfortunate incident."

"Defend her? Elspeth, what nonsense are you spouting?"

Gary's patience snapped, his brows furrowing in displeasure. "When has the Fairhaven family ever wronged Mr. Thaddeus Abernathy to warrant such hostility? Do you take us for fools? Don't push us too far!"

His words ignited a firestorm among the Fairhaven Group members, their glares burning into Thaddeus with undisguised hatred.

"Oh Gary, it's all a misunderstanding. Why would Thaddeus have any grievance with the Fairhaven Group? He and Jareth have been allies through countless battles."

Elspeth's lips twisted into a mocking smirk, her icy gaze flickering toward Evadne. "The real grudge holder is Ms. Ashbourne. All of Elmsworth knows about her feud with Ms. Edith Fairhaven—like fire and water, they are. Now that Evadne's had an accident and the Fairhaven Group nearly secured the contract, clearly she's still bitter. Is it any surprise Thaddeus wants to seek justice for her?"

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

While Evadne and Edith's rivalry was no secret, fabricating such accusations to tarnish the Fairhaven Group's reputation? Unthinkable! Emeric's face darkened, his lips pressed into a thin line. Such despicable tactics were beneath him. Even acknowledging this woman felt like an insult to his dignity.

Just as Thaddeus and Cassius prepared to intervene, another voice cut through the tension.

"Elspeth, after all these years, you remain unrepentant."

Myra, usually meek, stood firm, her eyes blazing with defiance. "Twenty years ago, you were a master manipulator, and it seems nothing's changed. You're still as vile and poisonous, unfit for decent company! But you've chosen the wrong target this time. Evadne, with her grace and kindness, has helped countless people. Her reputation in Skyrim is untouchable—not something your venomous tongue can tarnish! I'm not the same Myra you used to trample on. Attack me all you want, but lay a finger on Evadne, and you'll regret it!"

The crowd stood stunned.

This was the fiercest they'd ever seen Myra—gentle as a stream, now a roaring river. She wasn't defending herself but shielding Evadne from that wicked woman's malice.

"Myra." Evadne's voice trembled with emotion, fighting back tears.

"Ha! Mrs. Myra Ashbourne, when have I ever wronged you? Be careful with your accusations."

Elspeth feigned innocence, her words dripping with venom. "Everything I've said is true. Back then, it was you who couldn't control your urges, indulging in substances that led to your... unfortunate condition. No one forced you. Who wronged you? If you were truly innocent, why didn't you clear your name instead of hiding? Now you think you're untouchable, don't you? As the noble Mrs. Ashbourne, bearing Emeric's child, you think you can seek revenge? Hahaha! You call me unfit for polite society? What does that make you—a mistress?"

Silence fell like a guillotine. Even the Fairhaven family recoiled at Elspeth's audacity. Her words were beyond brazen!

Glynnis, watching Frederic's face darken with rage, broke into a cold sweat. Elspeth had gone too far, her agitation unnerving. Those last remarks were outright insults!

Myra trembled with fury, her entire body shaking. Then, Emeric's arm wrapped around her shoulders, his warm palm steadying her. Though silent, his presence was a fortress.

"Mr. Frederic Abernathy, as head of your household, can you control your foul-mouthed wretch?" Emeric's voice sliced through the silence, his gaze piercing Elspeth's soul.

The room gasped. Foul-mouthed wretch?!

If not for seeing his face, no one would believe these words came from the composed corporate titan! Elspeth's face flushed crimson, but under Emeric's glare, she shrank back.

Thaddeus blinked, momentarily stunned. "Chairman Ashbourne speaks his mind. Evadne, now I see where you get it from."

"He only shocks outsiders. At home, he's even more direct. You'll get used to it," Evadne murmured, her phone buzzing insistently. She glanced down, her demeanor shifting as a frosty smile curved her lips.

"Elspeth, you've crossed the line. Apologize to Mrs. Myra Ashbourne. Now." Frederic's voice was icy, his patience fraying.

Elspeth seethed, grinding her teeth. She'd underestimated Emeric's protection over Myra—something Frederic had never offered her. She dared challenge Myra but wouldn't risk Emeric's wrath. Reluctantly, she muttered, "I... apologize, Mrs. Myra Ashbourne."

"Is that all? A half-hearted apology?" Emeric's gaze burned with intensity. "Do you think my family is to be trifled with? That my woman can be bullied? And those vile words about my daughter—do you think I'm deaf? You think a pathetic 'sorry' fixes everything? The world doesn't work that way."

"Chairman Ashbourne, what do you want?" Frederic's patience snapped. While displeased with Elspeth's antics, Emeric's attitude toward the Abernathy Group infuriated him.

"The wretch slaps herself twice—once for insulting my woman, once for my daughter. For Mr. Hamilton Abernathy's sake, I'll let it slide." Emeric's calm demand detonated like a bomb.

The room erupted. Make Mrs. Abernathy slap herself? Might as well ask her to grovel in the dirt!

"You're insane! I'm a tycoon's wife! Frederic's wife! How dare you demand this?!" Elspeth shrieked, stomping like a petulant child.

Frederic's expression darkened, but he didn't comply. Emeric, however, was done waiting. "Damon!"

"At your service, Mr. Ashbourne!"

Damon—Emeric's right-hand enforcer—materialized before Elspeth. Before anyone could react, his arm swung, delivering two sharp slaps across her face.

"Ah!" Elspeth screamed, her cheeks flaming red, swelling instantly.

Damon, a former black belt, ensured she felt every ounce of justice. As Elspeth staggered, no one moved to help—not even the Fairhavens who'd defended her earlier.

No one dared provoke Emeric further. Mari, frozen in shock, was swiftly pulled away by Jareth. Glynnis, witnessing her mother's humiliation, cowered like a frightened mouse.

Bullies and cowards—mother and daughter were cut from the same cloth.

"Elspeth, I apologize, but this is the consequence of your actions. Let it be a lesson." Damon returned to Emeric's side, expressionless.

Elspeth wanted to lash out, but realizing she stood alone, she played the victim, clutching Frederic's arm. "Frederic! I'm your wife! How can you let them treat me like this? In front of everyone, I'm ruined! Frederic!"

She knew men prized their pride. Even if Frederic didn't care for her, he'd care for his reputation. Surely he wouldn't stay silent.

As expected, Frederic helped her up, his eyes blazing at Emeric. But before he could speak, the massive screen opposite lit up, capturing everyone's attention.

"Look! What's that?!"

"It's surveillance footage—crisper than usual."

"Wait... isn't that woman familiar?"

"My God! It's Elspeth!"

The video laid bare every movement, every word. Crystal clear.

Elspeth injecting something into her veins. Seconds later, laughing uncontrollably, dancing wildly. Then writhing on the ground, moaning obscenely. Soon, she was fully nude on screen, her hands roaming shamelessly.

"What the hell?! My eyes!"

"That's a drug reaction! She injected narcotics!"

"Record this! It'll be gone soon!"

"An adult film starring the Abernathy chairman's wife—uncensored! Save it for posterity!"

Thunder seemed to roar in Elspeth's ears, her world collapsing. Her face drained of color, her gaze vacant as she stared at her naked self on screen, shaking her head in denial. But the nightmare remained.

It wasn't an illusion. It was the end.

"What... is this?" Frederic's pupils trembled violently, his face purpling with rage.

He didn't want to believe the repulsive woman on screen was Elspeth, his wife of over two decades. But he couldn't lie to himself. It was undeniably her.

The Ashbournes, Fairhavens, and Chambers—including William and his son—were transfixed, forgetting to breathe.

Jareth, sensing disaster, pulled Mari's head to his chest and bolted.

Edith nudged the petrified Glynnis, smirking. "Wow, your mom really lets loose behind closed doors, huh? Like mother, like daughter?" Glynnis, humiliated, trembled violently, cold sweat dripping down her pale cheeks.

Thaddeus's eyes widened, shock and delight surging through him. His body radiated heat, his blood boiling with excitement.

He pulled Evadne close, his large hand caressing her waist. "Why didn't you tell me?" he murmured huskily.

Evadne tilted her chin, her fiery gaze meeting his. "Surprise. Where's the fun in spoiling it? Do you like it?"

His breath warmed her nose before his lips captured hers in a searing kiss. Their tongues danced as her fingers playfully tugged his tie, reveling in his instinctive response.

While everyone was distracted by Elspeth's scandal, the couple stole a passionate moment.

When they parted, Thaddeus's lips were stained with her lipstick, his eyes burning with affection. "You're wicked. I love it."

The racetrack buzzed anew with the unfolding drama. Surprisingly, the Chambers family, as hosts, didn't shut off the screen, letting the scandal escalate.

Elspeth was finished. Might as well use her downfall to fuel publicity for their racetrack! She could never have imagined her lifelong schemes would leave her with nothing but infamy.

"Frederic! Let me explain! I was set up—drugged! That's why I acted like that! I'm the victim! Believe me!" she stammered, clutching his arm.

Suddenly, uniformed officers approached. "Elspeth Abernathy, you're under arrest for drug trafficking, possession, and use."

The handcuffs snapped around her wrists, their chill striking terror into her heart. "No! I didn't—!"

Then, to her horror, warmth trickled down her thighs. Under everyone's watchful eyes, she'd lost control.

The ultimate humiliation.
###Chapter 452

The scene unfolded like a meticulously crafted stage play, every moment rehearsed to perfection.

Just as the scandalous footage of Isabella Sinclair overdosing in the lounge was leaked, the police descended upon her like vultures, swooping in for the arrest.

The massive screen cut to the live feed at that exact moment. Isabella's face was a twisted mask of hysteria and despair as she lost control of her bladder, being dragged away by officers. Her most humiliating moment was broadcast in high-definition close-up for the entire world to see.

Back in her modeling days, she had seethed with jealousy over Evelyn Prescott, the lead actress who always got the dramatic close-ups, whose face was unforgettable. She had longed for that kind of attention. Now, she had it—but her infamous meltdown would be the scandal of the decade, her name forever etched in tabloid history.

"Good grief. Did Isabella just wet herself? The high-and-mighty socialite reduced to that by a few cops? Hilarious! Talk about a spectacular downfall!"
"Are you blind? That's not fear—that's the drugs talking!"

"Trust me, this isn't her first run-in with the law. With the Sinclair Holdings backing her, even if she gets arrested, they won't just sit back. What's she got to be afraid of? I bet she just couldn't hold it in! How mortifying—I'd rather die than live through that embarrassment!"

As the officers hauled Isabella away, she trembled violently, urine still dripping shamefully onto the floor.

Nathaniel, save me. I'm innocent. I've been set up! Nathaniel!

Nathaniel Sinclair, staring at the disgraceful puddle and Isabella's pitiful state, was too stunned to speak. His wife kept redefining the limits of his humiliation.

"Mr. Nathaniel Sinclair, I tried to cut the feed, but the Vanderbilt family blocked our tech team from the control room. This whole thing—including the police—was a setup," Preston whispered urgently to Nathaniel.

"Set up by who?" Nathaniel demanded, his voice tight with fury.

"I'm still investigating, but I'll find out."

Nathaniel's mind reeled, but amidst the chaos, a memory from over two decades ago surfaced.

At Vogue Paris's anniversary gala, Evelyn had suffered the same public disgrace, broadcast live to the world! As a VIP guest, he and Alexander had witnessed the entire spectacle.

Evelyn's downfall due to the "substance abuse scandal" was common knowledge. Rumors claimed she had spiraled into severe depression, with multiple suicide attempts. Only Alexander's unwavering support and overseas treatment had pulled her back from the brink.

Now, Isabella's nightmare played out before the crowd, and Nathaniel couldn't shake the feeling this was a meticulously planned revenge. His furious gaze instinctively locked onto Arabella.

Coincidentally, Arabella and Sebastian were exchanging tender glances, their smiles triumphant. Her cunning, beautiful eyes and barely concealed smirk of victory felt like a slap to his face, an unforgivable insult.

"Your timing was impeccable," Arabella murmured, nudging Sebastian with her shoulder.

His heart melted at her touch, and he gazed at her warmly. "All thanks to your brilliant planning."

Arabella blushed at his praise, her cheeks turning a delicate shade of pink.

"If it weren't for the groundwork you laid, this arrest wouldn't have been such a spectacle. You did all the heavy lifting—I just provided the final push," Sebastian said, his eyes softening with affection. He was already thinking of ways to properly thank her.

Tonight, he'd make sure she felt his gratitude in every possible way. No—he'd spend a lifetime cherishing her.

"But I heard the cops arrested her on drug charges," Arabella said, puzzled.

Sebastian's gaze darkened. "We'll discuss the details at home. I'll explain everything."

Isabella's arrest had caught everyone off guard—except the young couple. Even Oliver was stunned, shooting his sister an incredulous look, to which Arabella responded with a playful wink.

Alexander wrapped his arms around Evelyn, who was trembling slightly. "Are you okay?" he asked softly. Though Isabella's downfall was satisfying, he worried it might trigger painful memories.

"Alexander, I'm stronger than you think. And I've waited far too long for this day," Evelyn said, stepping away to approach Arabella, her eyes brimming with gratitude.

"Arabella, thank you."

Arabella blinked innocently. "For what? I didn't do anything."

"I understand. I know." Evelyn's voice trembled as she grasped Arabella's hand tightly. "I'll never be able to repay you. But as long as I live, I'll try."

"This is karma—Isabella got exactly what she deserved. Don't worry, Evelyn. Just get some rest tonight, take Natalie on a trip, and I'll keep you updated. Something tells me this is just the beginning. Isabella's bad luck is far from over," Arabella said cryptically.

From the shadows, Adrian watched with a calculating gaze, adjusting his glasses.

"What do you make of this?"

Harvey's eyes flickered thoughtfully. "I'd bet it's a trap set by Ms. Sinclair and Sebastian. They have a deep grudge against Isabella—they'd want her to suffer."

"How's Ethan doing?" Adrian abruptly changed the subject.

"Our men have been watching him closely. He's still in New York."

Adrian smirked, curling his fingers until his knuckles turned white. "I think it's time we get him out of New York."

Harvey was taken aback. "But Ethan made outrageous demands—money, a private jet. You said to keep him on standby. Why the sudden change?"

"Give him whatever he wants. Just make sure he leaves," Adrian said coldly.

Harvey's eyes widened in realization, and he nodded grimly. "Understood, Mr. Vanderbilt."

As the racetrack's massive screen went dark, the excited murmurs of the crowd didn't fade.

Barry, seizing the moment, exchanged a glance with Gary.

Gary slipped away unnoticed, approaching William and his son with a charming smile. "Mr. William Morris, Mr. Ford Morris, you've come all this way—the Fairhaven family would be honored to host you. With this mess unfolding, I doubt Mr. Jeff Vanderbilt or Mr. Nathaniel Sinclair will be available. Why not join us for some refreshments?"

William hesitated, but before he could respond, Sebastian's sharp voice cut through the noise like a blade.

"Mr. Barry Fairhaven, Mr. Gary Fairhaven—planning to slink away like cowards? The mighty Fairhaven Group, so revered, reduced to fleeing at the first sign of trouble."

"Cowards? Sebastian, who the hell are you calling that?" Gary roared, his face flushing crimson.

The crowd gasped. Evelyn reprimanding Isabella was one thing—she had it coming, and as a powerhouse on par with Nathaniel, she could say whatever she pleased.

But Sebastian, a mere junior, daring to insult the Fairhavens? Did he not fear retaliation?

Arabella's heart raced as she locked eyes with Sebastian. She had already decided—even if he offended every elite in New York, she would stand by him.

With her backing, let's see who dared touch him.

Barry, trembling with rage, slammed his cane on the ground. "Mr. Nathaniel Sinclair! Control your son! Are you going to let him disrespect his elders like this?"

Sebastian, exuding an aura of icy authority, smirked. "Elders deserve respect—but those who turn a blind eye to injustice, who shield murderers, forfeit that privilege."

"Sebastian, enough!" Nathaniel barked.

"Today, you have two choices," Sebastian continued, ignoring his father. "Discipline your people yourself, or let me handle it—permanently." His chilling gaze shifted to Edith.

Edith shivered, her expensive gown damp with sweat. Why was he looking at her? Did he suspect her?

No—she hadn't lifted a finger. It was all Duke's doing. She was innocent!

"Fine! Investigate all you want!" Barry snarled. "But you'd better have proof it was someone from the Fairhaven family. If not, Sebastian, don't blame us for what comes next!"

Sebastian merely curled his lip. The entire Fairhaven Group was beneath his concern—why would he fear an old man's threats?

Yet Arabella couldn't help but worry. She hadn't been involved—did he actually have evidence?

As the racetrack manager, Matthew scrambled to retrieve all surveillance footage from the stables.

Soon, the footage was displayed. Unfortunately, despite multiple cameras, Wind's stall was in a blind spot in Zone D.

Only a shadow was visible, obscured by hay and horses—the perpetrator's face remained hidden.

The situation had reached a deadlock.

Duke exhaled in relief, while Edith smirked victoriously from the sidelines.

"Ha! So you have no proof, just baseless accusations?" Gary mocked. "No witnesses, no footage—yet you're so sure it's us? Sebastian, I get you want to defend Arabella's honor, but maybe you're biting off more than you can chew!"
###Chapter 453

The Ashbourne family was boiling with rage, their fury barely contained. But one among them was seething even more violently.

Thaddeus's muscles coiled like a taut bowstring, his eyes bloodshot, his fists clenched in icy wrath, ready to lunge at Gary and teach him a brutal lesson. Just then, a delicate hand wrapped around his tensed knuckles at the perfect moment.

"Thaddeus, don't."

His breath hitched as he met Evadne's piercing gaze, bright as starlight. It was like plunging into a mountain spring—cool, refreshing, instantly soothing the storm inside him.

Evadne stepped forward, lips curling into a haughty smirk. "Gary, when Thaddeus acts, you can be sure of one thing—he never lets the guilty escape, nor does he wrong the innocent."

A direct jab at the Fairhavens.

"As for the Duke's accusations—that Thaddeus is merely my puppet, smearing your family's name—ha! In this age of surveillance, if I truly wanted to frame someone, wouldn't there be evidence? Would I just randomly pick one of your people as the culprit?" Her voice dripped with mockery. "You claim I hold a grudge against Edith Fairhaven. Then why wasn’t her horse injured? Why wasn’t she the one in danger? Should I have harmed myself to entertain your entire family?"

Her words were razor-sharp. The crowd murmured in agreement, even Mrs. Fairhaven faltered, her conviction wavering.

"You insolent girl!" Barry choked, his face contorted with rage.

Evadne's eyes were glacial, her smirk venomous. "Let me be blunt—if I truly wanted Edith Fairhaven dead, I wouldn’t have waited until today. I may lack virtues, but I’m known for my ruthlessness."

She leaned in, voice dropping to a lethal whisper. "Framing someone? Too boring. If it were me, whatever fate befell my horse, she’d suffer the exact same."

Gasps rippled through the crowd. Ms. Ashbourne was merciless.

"Evadne! How dare you—" Mrs. Fairhaven clutched her chest, gasping for air.

"Mom, don’t upset yourself!" Edith steadied her mother, her face a mask of distress—but her eyes burned with venom as they locked onto Evadne.

"Malicious?" Myra’s usually gentle voice turned icy. "Mrs. Fairhaven, you dare call her malicious?"

She stepped forward, regal and unyielding. "Evadne merely spoke hypothetically, but your daughter acted. Before the race even began, Edith tried to frame Evadne by faking a fall—footage still trending online. Who’s truly malicious here? Don’t pretend you don’t know."

The Fairhaven women paled, speechless.

Emeric watched Myra, stunned. After decades of quiet grace, seeing her stand so fiercely—it was breathtaking.

This was how an Ashbourne should be.

Gary, ever Barry’s snarling attack dog, sneered. "Eloquent as you are, Ms. Ashbourne, it doesn’t change the facts—you’ve slandered our family, tarnished our name, and we won’t let this slide!"

Barry’s lips twisted. "You’ve already won the race. What more do you want? Must you drag us through the mud just to secure your deal with William Morris?"

Evadne remained composed, but William’s conflicted expression betrayed his wavering trust.

Then—every phone in the room buzzed simultaneously.

Thaddeus’s chilling voice cut through the tension. "Ladies and gentlemen, curious about those notifications?"

Confused, everyone checked their screens. Evadne’s breath caught.

The video was damning.

Duke, sneaking into the stables. A switchblade flashing. A deep gash carved into Wind’s flank.

Caught red-handed.

Barry’s vision blurred. "W-What is this?!"

Edith’s phone clattered to the floor.

Gordon shoved the screen in Duke’s face. The man’s jaw dropped. "Impossible... there were no cameras—"

"Of course we had proof." Gordon smirked. "Mr. Abernathy never makes a move unless he’s certain."

Barry and Gary finally understood—Thaddeus had let them rant, let them humiliate themselves, just to crush them harder.

Evadne’s heart swelled. This was the man she loved—calculating, unshakable, brilliant.

Thaddeus gestured, and Gordon ushered in a jockey.

"I’m from L Group," the man explained. "Our boss installed micro-cameras on our horses’ headgear—high-definition, recording everything."

The crowd gaped. Horse dash cams? Evadne nearly laughed. She had to meet this genius.

Duke’s face drained of color. After a lifetime of crime, he’d been undone... by a horse.

"Duke," Evadne said coldly, "you understand the consequences. Attempted murder. Animal cruelty. A long prison sentence."

She leaned closer. "But confess who sent you, and I’ll request leniency."

Duke’s gaze flicked to Edith—only to find her eyes deadly, warning him to stay silent.

He laughed bitterly. "No one sent me. I acted alone. You deserved to die for stealing Miss Fairhaven’s man. Do your worst."

Evadne’s blood ran cold. She knew Edith was behind this.

Thaddeus’s lips curled. "Good. Your confession was just broadcast live to the nation. Your own words will convict you."

The room erupted.

Gary’s secretary shrieked. "Mr. Barry—it’s everywhere! The whole world just saw everything!"

The Fairhavens froze—their empire crumbling in real time.
###Chapter 454

Isabella gasped. Only now did she notice the blinking green light hidden in the corner. A camera had been recording the entire time—without her knowledge, the Fairhaven family’s smug denials and Nathan’s brutish behavior had been broadcast live!

Everything had unfolded so stealthily that even someone as detail-oriented as Isabella had missed it.

The live chat exploded. Viewer numbers skyrocketed past five million.

[Unbelievable! The Fairhaven Group is ruthless! They’d harm animals just to win? And they nearly killed Ms. Sinclair! That’s criminal!]

[Disgusting! Morally bankrupt! They’ve hit rock bottom!]

[The Fairhaven family is rotten. Barry started as a dockworker hauling sacks before clawing his way up through sheer ruthlessness. No wonder they’re shameless!]

[Exactly! Comparing them to the Sinclair dynasty is laughable. Victoria trying to measure up to Isabella? Like reaching for the moon on tiptoes!]

[Ugh, why does Alexander Kingsley have to be tied to them? He’s too gorgeous for this mess!]

[Since when do looks determine morality? Though, I admit, Alexander is very easy on the eyes.]

Lucas had planned the live stream long before the confrontation, giving Alexander a heads-up.

At first, Lucas hesitated, but Alexander merely waved a dismissive hand. "Go for it. Make it explosive. Nathan’s got high blood pressure—if this lands him in bed for weeks, I owe you one."

Lucas smirked. "Always the rebel. But remember, public opinion can lift you up or drown you."

Alexander flicked his cigarette. "I used to think I was one of them. Now? The Fairhavens can rot. I’m my own man."

The broadcast shattered the Fairhavens’ arrogance. Victoria watched as her family was torn apart online. Instead of worrying about her doting grandfather, she was relieved Daniel hadn’t thrown her under the bus.

At least she kept her composure—unlike Penelope, who panicked so badly she wet herself. That would’ve been humiliating.

Margaret Fairhaven couldn’t handle the scandal. Drenched in sweat, she swayed on her feet.

"Grandpa Barry, Uncle Nathan, Mom needs a hospital—now!" Victoria didn’t wait for permission before ushering her mother out, flanked by bodyguards, tail between her legs.

In the parking lot, Margaret’s color returned—half from relief, half from escaping further humiliation. "Daniel’s always so careful. How could he act so recklessly?" she muttered.

Victoria patted her back, eyes icy. "He probably just wanted to put the Sinclairs in their place. But now? He’s the perfect scapegoat. If we pin everything on him, the fallout won’t touch us."

Margaret shook her head. "It’s not that simple. The live stream exposed everything. Even if Daniel acted alone, he’s still a Fairhaven. Our stock will plummet tomorrow."

Victoria feigned concern but inwardly gloated. The Fairhaven fortune was already secure for her and Margaret. Let Barry and Nathan clean up their own mess.

A sharp tap on the window startled her. She looked up into Alexander’s glacial stare.

"Victoria. Out. Now." His voice was steel.

Margaret bristled. "Alexander, she’s your sister. Must you be so harsh?"

"Out." His tone brooked no argument.

Victoria stepped out, keeping their conversation out of earshot.

"Been too busy with your little puppet to notice the storm at home?" Alexander sneered.

Victoria examined her nails, feigning indifference. "Why don’t you run back to her? She’s probably sobbing without you."

"Watch your mouth." Alexander loomed over her, eyes blazing. "Be grateful I still tolerate you. Push me, and you’ll end up like Glynnis. Test me."

Her pulse spiked, but she lifted her chin. "What do you want?"

"I know it was you. You pulled Daniel’s strings."

Her lips curled. "Prove it."

His fist slammed into the wall beside her head. "No one stays lucky forever, Victoria. Daniel took the fall for you, but not everyone will. You’ll drown in your own schemes."

She laughed. "Hurt me, and Mom won’t survive the shock. Are you willing to lose her too?"

Alexander’s muscles tensed, veins bulging with fury.

Inside, Barry and Nathan were seething. Their reputation was in tatters.

"We can’t leave!" Barry’s grip on his cane trembled. "Walking away now is surrender!"

So he stood before millions, severing ties with Daniel to salvage their name. "Daniel, I took you in as family. How could you betray us? Chairman Emeric, Mr. Lucas, we accept full responsibility."

Isabella smirked. Moments ago, they’d defended Daniel. Now? They’d tossed him aside like trash.

Lucas wasn’t satisfied. Arm around Isabella, he said coldly, "An apology is due."

Nathan bristled. "We’ve handed over the culprit! What more do you want?"

Adrian stepped in smoothly. "Mr. Fairhaven, Duke crippled a prized racehorse and injured Isabella. An apology isn’t just expected—it’s necessary."

The live chat erupted.

[Who’s this gorgeous man? Adrian Chambers? He’s always defending Isabella!]

[If I were her, I’d pick Adrian over Lucas. Regret won’t change the past.]

[Three years of marriage is enough. Trade up for a younger, hotter man!]

Barry’s veins pulsed with rage. He’d never been so humiliated.

Margaret hissed, "Why is Adrian interfering? He’s dragging the Chambers family into this!"

Sebastian’s gaze was icy. "He’s playing both sides. Stealing Lucas’s thunder while currying favor with Emeric."

Ultimately, Barry swallowed his pride and apologized.

The Fairhavens left in disgrace, their stock destined to crash. The day’s scandals—Victoria’s scheming, Isabella’s fall, Penelope’s humiliation, the Fairhavens’ sabotage—would fuel gossip for years.

As they departed, Emeric clapped Adrian’s shoulder. "Thank you. If the Fairhavens retaliate, tell me. You stood by Isabella—I won’t forget it."

Adrian smiled modestly, but Isabella cut in coldly, "Emeric, are you senile? He wasn’t even here from the start. Don’t be ridiculous."
###Chapter 455

Avery refused to look at Evadne, his face shadowed as he adjusted his glasses.

Thaddeus stood beside the petite woman, lips pressed into a thin line. He wanted to intervene, but she was always quicker, sharper. Besides, if he stepped in now, wouldn’t he be playing right into Avery’s hands? Becoming exactly the kind of man Jareth had described with such disdain.

"How are you feeling, Evadne?" Thaddeus murmured, his voice low. "Is your back still hurting?"

Emeric ignored his daughter’s sharp tongue, his concern solely for her well-being. "You’re as stubborn as your mother. After a fall like that, you should’ve gone straight to the hospital! Wind and Gene have everything under control. Why do you insist on being involved?" He sighed, shaking his head. "Cassius, call Mr. Larry immediately. Have him take Evadne to the hospital and assemble a team of specialists."

Cassius, sensing the tension, wisely stayed out of it. He knew better than to intrude when the young couple needed privacy. "That won’t be necessary," Evadne interjected smoothly. "Thaddeus is all the company I need."

She boldly laced her fingers with Thaddeus’s, locking eyes with him in a gaze that left no room for anyone else. "Dad, let me remind you of something—true warriors don’t boast about their victories. Who was it who gathered the evidence today? Who stood up for me, for Wind, for our family under all that pressure? And who did it all without seeking credit?" Her voice was steel. "I hope you see things clearly and aren’t swayed by sweet talk. Don’t let yourself become a laughingstock."

With that, she lifted her chin and strode past Emeric and Avery, dragging Thaddeus along with her.

A chill settled over Avery’s shoulder as they passed, a sharp pang twisting in his chest. His hands clenched into fists, his expression darkening.

Thaddeus, ever the gentleman, gave Emeric a quick, stiff bow before following Evadne out.

"That girl," Emeric muttered, watching them go. "I swear, I can’t control her anymore!"

Cassius and Myra exchanged amused glances. Some men would kill for that kind of "misery" and never get the chance.

As Evadne climbed into Thaddeus’s car and drove away, resentment clawed at Avery’s chest, his eyes burning red.

But he quickly schooled his expression, turning to Emeric with sorrowful eyes. "Mr. Ashbourne, I failed today. I should’ve acted faster. I let you and Evadne down."

"Don’t be so hard on yourself," Emeric said warmly. "You did well. If it weren’t for you, who knows how the Fairhavens might’ve treated Evadne?"

"If I’d done better," Avery murmured, his voice laced with guilt, "maybe Evadne would’ve looked at me differently. And you wouldn’t have had to go through all this trouble."

Emeric studied him for a long moment before sighing. "Avery, I’ve seen everything you’ve done for Evadne. But matters of the heart… they can’t be forced."

Avery’s breath hitched. What did that mean?

Just days ago, Emeric had been adamant about pushing him and Evadne together. Why the sudden change? Was it because Thaddeus had played the hero today? Had Emeric finally seen him in a new light, overlooking the years of pain he’d caused Evadne?

Or had Emeric never truly hated Thaddeus as much as he pretended?

After everything, was he back to square one?

No. He wouldn’t accept that. He needed Evadne.

Myra stepped forward, linking her arm with Emeric’s. "Mr. Chambers, Emeric means no offense. We all know your feelings for Evadne are sincere. But love must be mutual to work. As her family, her happiness is all that matters. If she marries someone she doesn’t love, we’d be ruining her life."

Cassius smirked, his gaze dripping with disdain.

Avery’s face paled, his fingers trembling.

"Let things take their course," Emeric said gently.

Despite her protests, Evadne found herself practically carried to the hospital by Thaddeus.

By the time they returned home, it was late.

"Why do you always have to be so stubborn?" Evadne huffed as she stepped out of the car, only to wince when a sharp pain shot through her back.

Thaddeus was at her side in an instant, his arms wrapping around her. "Stop pretending you’re fine. Remember how loud you were at the hospital?"

Her cheeks flushed. "I wasn’t that loud."

"Weren’t you?" His voice dropped, husky. "I thought I was outside a delivery room, waiting for our baby."

The word baby sent a pang through her heart. She flinched, but Thaddeus, mistaking it for pain, scooped her up and carried her inside.

Alva had been waiting anxiously. "Mrs. Abernathy! Are you alright?"

"I’m fine," Evadne grumbled, punching Thaddeus’s chest. "He’s just being dramatic."

Thaddeus chuckled, his eyes soft. "Yes, my warrior princess. The strongest, most stunning woman I’ve ever met."

He hated calling her strong. No woman should have to be.

She should be cherished, protected.

And he’d be the one to do it.

Evadne’s stomach growled. Alva hurried to prepare dinner while Evadne demanded a bath.

"I smell like a stable!"

"No," Thaddeus said firmly. "The doctor said no water on those wounds for a week." He carried her to their room. "I’ll give you a sponge bath."

She pouted. "Will that even get me clean?"

"Of course," he murmured, his breath hot against her ear. "I’ll make sure you’re spotless."

"Don’t get any ideas," she warned. "I just want to sleep tonight."

Images of tangled limbs and whispered promises flickered in her mind. Her body warmed.

Thaddeus sighed, his gaze heavy. "I can control myself. I’ll wait until you’re healed."

In the bathroom, he carefully wiped her down, his lips trailing along her neck.

He could restrain his body, but not his heart.

"You’re usually so articulate in board meetings," Evadne teased, tracing his Adam’s apple. "What happened today with my father? Cat got your tongue?"

Thaddeus kissed her softly. "As long as you’re safe, I don’t care who gets the credit."

Tears pricked her eyes. This was why she loved him.

Nothing else mattered to him but her.

"It’s just…" He exhaled roughly. "I feel like I can’t win. Like I’m always falling short."

"That’s not true," she whispered.

He would always be her hero.

But she wouldn’t tell him that.

She didn’t want him getting too cocky.
###Chapter 456

After a refreshing shower, Alexander didn't want Isabella to strain herself, so he effortlessly lifted her into his arms and carried her to the dining room for supper.

He had been on his feet all day, and his usually pristine white shirt now clung to his body, radiating warmth mixed with the scent of his exertion.

Isabella felt lightheaded, but instead of recoiling, she buried her nose against his chest, inhaling deeply like a kitten savoring its favorite scent.

"What's wrong? Craving me?" Alexander murmured with a low chuckle, his lips brushing her forehead.

"Even if I did, you'd need to be spotless first," Isabella retorted, her cheeks flushing as she averted her gaze. "Aren't you usually Mr. Clean? What happened today?"

"Didn't have time. I'll shower after we eat."

Isabella pressed her lips together, warmth blooming in her chest.

The table was laden with an array of exquisite dishes, some prepped earlier by Olivia, needing only a quick reheat. "Wow, Olivia, you're amazing!" Isabella clapped her hands excitedly, her joy making her look like a delighted schoolgirl.

"Mrs. Kingsley, don't flatter me—your cooking skills far surpass mine!" Olivia grinned. "A few of Mr. Kingsley's favorites here are actually your recipes, remember?"

"Really? I'd forgotten," Isabella admitted sheepishly before digging into her meal with gusto.

She knew Olivia meant to compliment her, but the words inevitably stirred bittersweet memories. Alexander, acutely aware of the hardships she had endured, felt a pang of sorrow as he gently wiped her lips with a napkin.

Just as he was about to speak, Isabella swiftly popped a piece of shrimp into his mouth. "No apologies. Didn't we agree to leave the past behind?"

Alexander paused, then gave a wry smile as he chewed. Nothing tasted better than when his woman made it.

Suddenly, the front door swung open, and three boisterous men barged in, instantly filling the villa with lively chatter. "Seriously, Isabella, hogging all this food for yourself? That's just unfair!" Harrison, who hadn't eaten all day while reviewing case files, lunged forward and grabbed a pork knuckle, stuffing it into his mouth.

Nathaniel followed suit, tearing into a dish like a man starved. "Been interrogating suspects all day—I need meat to recharge!"

The Sinclair brothers, usually so refined, devoured the food as if it were their last meal, leaving Alexander and Daniel stunned. "Those two are like mythical beasts—one a gluttonous tiger, the other a ravenous wolf," Daniel muttered.

Isabella sighed, resting her cheek on her hand. "If Eleanor and William saw this, they'd disown them on the spot."

Olivia, delighted by their enthusiasm, hurried to offer more. "There's plenty! I made pasta too, but since Mr. Kingsley doesn't like it, I didn't serve it. Would you two like some?"

Harrison and Nathaniel nodded eagerly. "Yes! Anything else?"

Isabella rolled her eyes. "Be grateful there's food at all. You're pushing it."

Daniel couldn't take it anymore and discreetly reminded them, "Ahem. Harrison, Nathaniel, Mrs. Kingsley took a serious fall from her horse today. As her brothers, shouldn't you at least show some concern?"

The brothers exchanged glances, one mid-bite, the other chewing furiously. "She looks fine to me, eating happily. No need to overreact," they said in unison.

Daniel was speechless. Who was the heartless one here?

Isabella, nestled in Alexander's arms, shook with laughter. His strong arm supported her waist gently, content just to watch her smile.

The Sinclair brothers rarely appeared together—when they did, it meant something serious was afoot.

Nathaniel belched, his expression turning grave. "Elspeth tested positive for drugs this afternoon. Not just prescription misuse—actual substance abuse. But she's denying everything, claiming she thought she was getting beauty treatments from her doctor, Victor, and had no idea about the drugs. Says she's been framed."

Isabella froze.

The treatments given to Elspeth had indeed been prepared by Victor. With his extensive pharmacological knowledge, Isabella had trusted him completely—never suspecting he would administer drugs to her!

At that dosage, it was practically attempted murder.

"Nathaniel, Victor has nothing to do with this," Isabella insisted, defending him. "Elspeth's desperate—she's trying to drag someone down with her."

"I know Victor. He's had our father's support and is close to you," Nathaniel said, his playful demeanor fading into professional solemnity. "But as a police officer, I have to remain impartial. Right now, Elspeth is adamant Victor set her up. Even if it's false, protocol demands we bring him in for questioning."

Isabella's shoulders slumped, guilt weighing heavily on her.

Alexander's brow furrowed slightly—he hated seeing tension between the siblings. Stroking Isabella's hand, he said calmly, "Captain Sinclair, we understand procedure. Do what you must."

The formal address—"Captain Sinclair"—made Nathaniel regard Alexander with renewed respect. But Isabella remained uneasy. She knew Nathaniel was right, but she couldn't shake her guilt over Victor. She didn't want anyone else hurt because of her.

The rare tension between the siblings thickened the air.

Nathaniel's chest tightened—he hadn't meant to upset his sister. "I need to head back to the precinct," he said quietly. "Harrison, why don't you stay with Isabella? We don't see her often enough."

As he turned to leave, Isabella suddenly sprang up and flung herself at him, wrapping her arms tightly around his waist. "Nathaniel, don't go! I didn't ask you to leave!"

Instinctively, Nathaniel embraced her back, his eyes glistening.

As her half-brother, Isabella was just as dear to him as any full sibling, yet he always held back, too shy to voice his affection. Rare were the moments he could hug her without restraint.

"Thought you were mad at me," he murmured, stroking her hair.

Isabella looked up, her eyes bright with unshed tears, and shook her head. "Nathaniel, how could I be mad? I know how hard you've worked—police academy, detective squad, now leading it. I shouldn't mix personal feelings with duty. Go do what you need to. Whatever happens, I support you."

Daniel watched the tender exchange, then peeked at Alexander's expression.

Predictably, the man looked like someone had dumped the entire feast into a sewer.

Alexander took a deep breath, struggling to compose himself, but envy still flushed his cheeks.

"Jealous, huh?" Harrison plopped into a chair beside him, shoving a muffin into his mouth. "If you can't handle this, how will you cope with Isabella? You'll be crying more often than not! Then you won't just be 'Unfaithful Alexander'—you'll be our modern-day Heathcliff."

Alexander's blood pressure spiked. "Even as her brothers, she has a partner now. And frankly, you're not getting any younger. Propriety matters."

Harrison nearly choked. "If William heard you, he'd end your bright future prematurely."

"No, he wouldn't," Alexander countered coolly. "He couldn't stand his sister being a widow."

Harrison was speechless.

Nathaniel was indeed swamped—Elspeth's case was no small matter. Until justice was served, he wouldn't rest.

After dinner, they gathered in the living room. Nathaniel's phone rang—a call from the precinct. His expression darkened.

"Nathaniel, what's wrong?" Isabella asked anxiously.

Nathaniel met Alexander's gaze. "Mr. Kingsley, your father hired Elmsworth's top lawyer to represent Elspeth. He's at the precinct now, demanding her release on bail."

"Damn it!" Daniel exploded. "He thinks the police station is his family's backyard? Some lawyers have no conscience—justice is blind, but they're blinded by money!"

"Elmsworth's top lawyer?" Alexander and Isabella exchanged glances. "Cedric Dempsey?"

"You know him?" Nathaniel was surprised.

"More than know him—he's an 'old friend,'" Isabella said with a scornful laugh.

"A lapdog for the Kingsley Group," Alexander muttered. Cedric was ruthless—no easy opponent.

"We need to secure Elspeth's conviction fast," Isabella said urgently. "If it's just the drug charge, with the Kingsleys' influence and Cedric's skills, she might walk."

Harrison looked at Alexander gravely. "Mr. Kingsley, I've seen your mother's file. After twenty years, the evidence chain is weak. If you sue Elspeth for murder, chances are slim."

Isabella stared at Alexander's stern profile, stunned. Even Harrison had been consulted. He had done everything to avenge his mother.

"Also, in Erica's case, Ward was the hitman—Elspeth was an accessory. If Cedric shifts blame onto Ward, she might only get a decade, not the death penalty," Harrison added.

The air grew oppressive.

"Harrison, we have Erica's recordings—conversations between Elspeth and Glynnis. Can't those convict her?" Isabella asked desperately.

Harrison shook his head. "Those are illegal recordings—inadmissible in court."

Isabella slumped against Alexander, hope draining away.

He held her close, steadying her trembling shoulders. "I know testimony alone isn't enough. But what if I say I have physical evidence?"
###Chapter 457

The three others stood frozen in shock.

"Alexander, it's been twenty years—where could you possibly find evidence now?" Isabella Sinclair gripped the man's hand tightly.

Alexander Kingsley intertwined his fingers with hers, his voice rough with emotion. "Remember when I told you I tracked down that maid who used to work for my mother?"

The woman nodded obediently.

"People often sense disaster before it strikes. Before Eleanor met her end, the maid seemed to sense danger. Dominic sent someone to intercept her in time, and... I had to take certain measures."

Alexander took a deep breath before continuing. "In sheer panic, to save her son, she revealed truths—things not even mentioned in that recording. The real truth."

He was inherently kind-hearted. If it hadn't been absolutely necessary, he would never have used a child's life as leverage, resorting to threats like a merciless monster.

Isabella knew that even if the maid had refused to talk, Alexander wouldn’t have harmed her son. He couldn’t. If he had, how would he be any different from Nathaniel?

"My mother was murdered by Eleanor. She poisoned her with her own hands," Alexander's eyes burned red, his voice trembling with barely contained fury. His hand, clutched in Isabella's, was ice-cold.

"Poisoned her herself?!" Preston and Sebastian were so stunned their faces went rigid.

Dominic staggered as if struck by a heavy blow. Isabella's throat tightened, the air suddenly thin, her chest crushed beneath an invisible weight.

Anyone else would have lost their mind, but because Alexander hadn't, his eerie calm only made her heart ache more.

"Mr. Kingsley, what exactly happened back then?" Sebastian pressed urgently.

"The maid confessed that she had indeed followed Eleanor’s orders to switch my mother’s depression medication, but she replaced it with harmless vitamins—nothing fatal. However, during that time, Eleanor must have sensed my mother and Reginald’s relationship improving. Fearing exposure, she swapped the harmless pills for poison. Taken daily in small doses, it would accumulate and cause sudden cardiac arrest."

Alexander’s broad shoulders trembled as he spoke, each word laced with ice and hatred.

Tears welled in Isabella’s eyes as she gently stroked his back.

"How did the maid know all this?" Preston, ever the prosecutor, demanded.

"She saw it."

Alexander tightened his grip on Isabella’s hand, as if only her touch could keep him grounded. "She said that two days before my mother’s fall, she realized Eleanor would sneak back in to switch the pills again—without ever mentioning it to her. She didn’t dare ask."

"That’s because if your mother had died of heart failure, the maid handling her medication would have been the prime suspect," Isabella reasoned coldly. "By then, it wouldn’t matter what she said—she’d be the one taking the fall."

"She knew that. But she was already in too deep. There was no turning back." Alexander’s face paled further. "But on the day it happened, there was an unexpected twist. My mother, who had been walking in the garden, went back to her room to retrieve her forgotten camera."

"And she caught Eleanor in the act?" Isabella’s heart plummeted.

He nodded grimly. "The maid, hiding just outside the room, eavesdropped. She’d been on edge for days, unable to sleep."

"Hmph! She can catch up on all that lost sleep behind bars!" Sebastian snarled through clenched teeth.

"The maid said she couldn’t see inside, but she heard a heated argument between my mother and Eleanor. She mentioned that ever since my mother married into the Kingsley family, she’d seemed devoid of emotion. That was the first time she’d ever seen her so enraged—it terrified her."

"And then?" Isabella watched him intently.

"Then, there was sudden silence in the room. And right after that... I witnessed—"

Alexander couldn’t finish. His chest heaved, his eyes bloodshot, nostrils flaring with each ragged breath. His hand, slick with sweat and clasped in Isabella’s, shook uncontrollably.

Before him flashed the haunting image of his mother’s lifeless body hitting the ground. The sound—muffled, heavy—was something he could never forget. The sickening crack of bones shattering.

He’d only looked once, but the pain of that moment would haunt him forever.

"Stop, Alexander. Please, stop."

Isabella pulled him into a fierce embrace, wishing she could fuse their hearts together. He hadn’t shed a tear, but hers fell freely, soaking his white shirt.

"It’s okay. Despite everything, I haven’t lost myself to the hatred. I haven’t broken."

Alexander’s eyes softened as he wiped her tears away with his rough fingertips. "Most importantly, you’re here, Isabella. You don’t know how much you mean to me. You’ve given me strength I didn’t know I had. Without you, I might have drowned in despair."

In that moment, Preston and Sebastian understood. As Reginald had said—Isabella was Alexander’s lifeline.

Once the couple had steadied themselves, Sebastian frowned. "The maid heard the argument stop right before you heard your mother fall. Could that be indirect proof that Eleanor was involved? She was the only one in that room."

"You mentioned earlier that your mother and Mr. Kingsley had been reconciling. And she was furious when she found out Eleanor had tampered with her medication. That doesn’t sound like someone planning to end her own life," Preston added.

"Without concrete evidence, we can only speculate. But it’s highly likely Eleanor pushed her."

"The maid said after my mother fell, Eleanor rushed out in a panic, bumping into her. She threatened the maid into silence, paying her off to disappear forever." Alexander wrapped an arm around Isabella, drawing comfort from her presence.

"She’s a key witness—you must protect her at all costs," Sebastian warned.

"First, we nail Eleanor on the drug charges. Keep her detained. Then, gather more evidence to prosecute her for murder." Preston’s eyes burned with fury.

Now Isabella understood why Alexander hadn’t arrested Eleanor for lesser crimes. He only had one shot—and it had to count.

"Alexander, you mentioned physical evidence?" Isabella’s eyes gleamed with curiosity.

The man’s gaze darkened, his hand sliding possessively around her waist as he leaned in, his lips brushing her ear. "Later. Behind closed doors, I’ll tell you everything."

Meanwhile, The Velvet Haven was a scene of carnage.

Harvey and Elsie stood at the basement door, listening to the blood-curdling screams within. Harvey felt sick to his stomach, but Elsie remained eerily composed.

"You’re something else—not even flinching. The only other woman I’ve seen with nerves like yours is Ms. Sinclair."

Elsie’s lips curled coldly. "It’s bad enough I resemble Isabella. Must I also lack my own personality?"

"Relax, I didn’t mean anything by it." Before Harvey could finish, the basement door swung open.

Nathaniel emerged, his white silk shirt splattered with blood, his face, neck, and throat streaked crimson. He breathed heavily, sweat mingling with blood as it dripped down his chiseled features. His eyes burned with vengeful satisfaction—like a demon who had feasted on suffering.

"Mr. Chambers," Harvey and Elsie bowed in unison.

Nathaniel tossed the bloodied whip aside, removed his gold-rimmed glasses, and wiped the lenses with his shirt.

Back in Helgen, whenever stressed, he’d hunt in the mountains. Elmsworth offered no such luxury—so he’d taken to beating people instead. He found it far more entertaining. A habit he intended to keep.

The two followed him silently, but Harvey noticed Nathaniel’s bleeding hand. He nudged Elsie.

"Ms. Archer, Mr. Chambers is hurt. Tend to his wound!"

Elsie hesitated before approaching. "Mr. Chambers, your hand—let me help—ah!"

In a flash, Nathaniel seized her wrist with brutal force, dragging her into the room. The door slammed shut, leaving Harvey outside, his stomach twisting with unease.

Inside, Nathaniel’s hunger manifested in a savage kiss, his hands tearing her blouse to shreds. As they reached the bed, Elsie—now in only her undergarments—covered herself, trembling. "No... please, Mr. Chambers."

"Elsie, you dare refuse me?" Nathaniel pinned her down, his gaze burning into her face—so eerily similar to Isabella’s. "Isabella can reject me. But you? What right do you have?"

With that, he struck her.

The blow sent Elsie reeling, her cheek swelling, ears ringing. In nearly a decade by his side, he’d never once raised a hand to her.

That slap shattered the last of her illusions.

The man she’d once known—kind, gentle, perfect—was gone. She barely recognized him now.

Nathaniel froze, lips parting—but before he could speak, his phone rang. He stepped away, retrieving it from his pocket.

The name on the screen made his brow furrow.

"Why are you calling now?"

"If I didn’t, how would you handle your current mess?" The voice on the other end was teasing, light.

Nathaniel turned away, but Elsie could still hear the caller’s voice—melodic, smooth, unforgettable.

"Even you know about it," Nathaniel’s tone was uncharacteristically respectful.

"Of course. The Sinclair heiress is quite the force, isn’t she? Beautiful, temperamental—never resting until she stirs up a storm. I rather like her."

Nathaniel’s jaw clenched, teeth sinking into his lower lip.

"But don’t worry. I’m a gentleman—I don’t poach another man’s desires. I won’t compete for the woman you love."

The man’s voice dripped with mockery. "Not only will I not compete—I’ll help you win Ms. Sinclair."
###Chapter 458

Avery's spirit, worn down and defeated, suddenly sparked to life at the words: "I'm listening."

"Check your phone. There's something you need to see."

His fingers twitched toward the screen, and sure enough, a new email notification glowed back at him.

Elsie watched the rigid line of his shoulders, her curiosity burning. Who could possibly shake the unshakable Avery like this?

His lips pressed into a thin line as he opened the email—a hospital report. His eyes scanned the document, then froze. His pupils shrank to pinpricks, his grip on the phone nearly failing as shock clamped around his heart like a vise.

"What's wrong? Scared?" The voice on the other end dripped with amusement.

"This can't be real."

Avery's hands trembled as he read the diagnosis again and again, his body turning to ice. "Evadne was pregnant with Thaddeus's child? How? When?"

"Does it matter?" The voice turned cold, mocking. "Be grateful the child didn't survive. At least you won't have to play stepfather to Thaddeus's heir. That would've been... awkward."

Avery's chest ached, his vision blurring with unshed tears.

"Thaddeus still doesn't know. Neither does Chairman Ashbourne. None of them do." The voice continued, merciless. "Imagine if the Ashbourne men found out Evadne lost their grandchild—their only chance at an heir. Do you think they'd ever let her near Thaddeus again?"

Avery's grip on the phone turned bone-white.

He was right. This was Evadne's deepest pain—and the perfect weapon to tear her away from Thaddeus forever.

He would use it. Without hesitation.

"Thank you," Avery said, his voice low and dangerous. "If this works, I owe you everything."

"You already do," the voice replied smoothly. "Just remember—don't be the one to spread this. Let someone else do the dirty work."

"Don't worry." Avery adjusted his glasses, a cruel smile curling at the edges of his lips. "I already have the perfect pawn."

Meanwhile, the Abernathy and Fairhaven Groups were drowning in scandal.

Elspeth's disgrace at the races had gone viral. No amount of PR could scrub the internet clean—the filth had spread too far, too fast.

[Who's got the video? Send it to me!]

[Sharing is caring!]

[I need to see this train wreck!]

[Same here!]

[Trust me, it's worth it. DM me.]

[Seriously? Y'all are into this? Fine, send it my way too.]

The Abernathy Group's reputation was in tatters, but the Fairhaven Group had it worse.

The poisoning of a racehorse—owned by the powerful K Group—had made national headlines. Their stock plummeted overnight, wiping out millions. Business partners fled, terrified of becoming the next target.

Gary Fairhaven scrambled to contain the damage, but his own reckless behavior at the races had turned him into a laughingstock. No one took him seriously anymore.

Barry Fairhaven, the family patriarch, lay in a hospital bed, his face red with fury. "Useless! All of you!" He slammed a fist against the mattress. "If we don't fix this, I'm cutting you all off! Every last cent!"

Edith paled. The inheritance was everything.

Barry's voice cracked with grief. "God took my only worthy son from me. Look at what's left of this family!"

Mrs. Fairhaven sobbed quietly.

Gary clenched his jaw. "Father, give me time. I can fix this."

"No." Barry's glare was final. "From now on, Jareth handles everything. You stay out of sight before you make things worse."

Gary's face darkened. Years of work, undone in a single night.

Edith, sensing an opening, leaned in. "Grandfather... there is one way to save us."

"What?"

"The alliance with the Abernathys. The one you mentioned at the races."

Mrs. Fairhaven gasped. "Edith! Not now!"

Gary scoffed. "With your scandal still trending? No one would dare touch you."

Barry's eyes sharpened. "No. The proposal must happen."

Edith's heart raced.

"An alliance with the Abernathys would stabilize our stocks, silence our critics," Barry said. "And the Abernathys need us just as much. With J Corporation's backing, this scandal will be forgotten."

"But Thaddeus—" Gary argued.

"Is obsessed with Evadne," Barry finished grimly. "Unless she disappears, he'll never look at another woman."

Just then, Edith's phone buzzed. She slipped out to answer it—and returned minutes later, eyes gleaming.

"Grandfather," she whispered, taking his hand. "I have a plan. One that will destroy Thaddeus and Evadne for good... and force the Abernathys to accept me."
###Chapter 459

At the racetrack, Isabella single-handedly exposed the entire Vanderbilt Group's scandal!

As the patriarch of the Vanderbilt family, Reginald issued an ultimatum to Nathaniel—let Isabella rot in jail. If Nathaniel interfered again, he would disown him as his son, permanently!

But Nathaniel had his own agenda. Abandoning Isabella now would only fuel the media frenzy. They'd paint him as heartless, a ruthless capitalist who discarded women like pawns.

From his arranged marriage to the Sinclair heiress, to whispers of Eleanor's depression and tragic end, and now Isabella—implicated in drug use and dragged off in handcuffs—he couldn’t bear the world’s judgment. The narrative was clear: any woman tied to Nathaniel was doomed.

For his own reputation, he couldn’t let Isabella be branded a criminal. What Nathaniel didn’t expect was Alexander bypassing him entirely, calling an emergency board meeting without his approval.

And at that meeting, Alexander officially stripped Isabella of her executive position! By the time Nathaniel arrived, it was over. The executives stood in silence as he stormed in.

"Alex, you owe me an explanation. Who gave you the authority to call this meeting without consulting me?!" Nathaniel’s fury was palpable.

"It was a standard corporate meeting, nothing unusual."

Alexander leaned back, spinning a pen between his fingers, his gaze unreadable. "As CEO, am I not entitled to preside over daily operations? Why the sudden outrage?"

"You overstepped! Dismissing Isabella without my approval violates protocol!" Nathaniel’s face burned with anger.

"There was no time."

Alexander’s voice was ice. "The public is waiting for Vanderbilt’s response. Three days of silence have already damaged our reputation. As CEO, I had to act. Unless you still intend to save Isabella, in which case—you’re the one defying reason."

"Alexander!"

"Isabella—embezzler, repeat offender, now a suspected drug user—does she deserve to remain an executive? Does she think Vanderbilt is her personal bank?" Alexander scoffed.

"The police haven’t confirmed anything! This could be a setup!"

The board members exchanged uneasy glances.

"And what kind of setup involves her willingly injecting herself with drugs?"

"That’s the inconsistency! It’s too perfect—Isabella isn’t reckless!"

The moment Nathaniel blurted it out, he regretted it. Had he just implied Isabella had only avoided consequences because she was careful?

The room’s disapproval thickened.

Alexander stood, straightening his tie. "The decision is final. The entire company knows she’s been terminated. There’s no taking it back."

He moved to leave.

"Alexander, don’t forget your place! I’m still the Chairman. I decide who leads this company!"

Nathaniel pointed at him, trembling with rage. "You think you’re untouchable? I put you in that seat, and I can replace you with Oliver in a heartbeat!"

The room held its breath.

The Vanderbilt father-son feud was no secret, but this public showdown was unprecedented.

Alexander, though formidable, had delivered undeniable results. Under him, Vanderbilt’s profits had soared.

To threaten his position over Isabella? It reeked of irrational favoritism.

Once, such words would have enraged Alexander. But now, his priorities had shifted.

Vanderbilt was no longer his everything. His Seraphina was worth a thousand times more.

"Going forward, I don’t care who runs Vanderbilt. But as long as I’m CEO, Isabella will face consequences. No one stops me."

With that, Alexander strode out, leaving Nathaniel seething.

Outside, the city lights flickered to life.

Alexander slumped into his car, exhaling heavily.

"Mr. Vanderbilt, that was legendary!" Gordon grinned, buzzing with adrenaline.

"Legendary comes with a price," Alexander muttered, rubbing his temples.

"Worth it! Besides, Mr. Oliver Vanderbilt? The man faints at the sight of blood. If he even steps foot in New York, he’d flee back to Europe within a week!" Gordon chuckled. "And now that you and Mrs. Vanderbilt are reconciled, you’ve got the Sinclair empire backing you. Once you’re married, your father-in-law is the chairman of Sinclair Holdings. With your brothers-in-law—mythic heroes compared to mere mortals—who would dare challenge you? Your throne is secure!"

"Are you suggesting I live off Seraphina’s wealth?" Alexander’s eyes narrowed dangerously.

Gordon paled. "N-No! I just meant—strategic alliances!"

Alexander smirked. "Gordon, one day I’ll introduce you to Dr. Lockwood. A neurologist. You might need a checkup."

Gordon laughed nervously. Since Alexander had been with Seraphina, he’d mellowed. Before, he’d have fired Gordon on the spot. Now, he almost seemed... amused.

Alexander closed his eyes, chest tight. Years of fighting for Vanderbilt, only to be treated as disposable.

"Drive. Let’s go home."

His voice softened. "I miss her. So much."

——

That evening, Seraphina hummed as she stirred a pot, wincing at the ache in her back. Olivia was out visiting a friend, leaving Seraphina alone.

Injured and sore, she still refused to stay in bed. She wanted Alexander to come home to a warm meal.

She chuckled, remembering her old plan to win him over through cooking.

How naive. True love didn’t need gourmet meals. The right person would adore you even at your worst.

Lost in thought, she didn’t notice Alexander approaching.

"Ah!"

She gasped as his arms wrapped around her, his warmth enveloping her.

"I leave for a few hours, and you’re already misbehaving. You should be resting." His grip was firm, almost painful, but she didn’t protest.

His breath at her neck was warm, ticklish. She frowned. "Have you been smoking?"

"Seraphina, I’m sorry. I couldn’t help it." His voice was rough with regret. "It won’t happen again."

"Something’s bothering you." She turned in his arms, searching his face.

"Nothing."

"Did Mr. Reginald Vanderbilt give you trouble today?"

Alexander laughed ruefully. "Do you have me bugged?"

"Obviously." She poked his chest. "Was it about Isabella?"

"I terminated her today. Reginald wasn’t happy. He’s determined to protect her."

His tone was casual as he tucked a strand of her hair behind her ear. "But don’t worry. I won’t let him. Isabella will pay."

"Mr. Reginald isn’t protecting her. He’s protecting his own reputation. What would people say about a man whose women keep falling from grace?"

"I know. My father’s greatest talent is his selfishness."

A wave of discomfort crossed his face. "But once we’re married, we’ll leave the Vanderbilt estate."

Married?!

Seraphina’s heart raced, cheeks flushing.

"If you want to stay near your family, we’ll live in Skyrim. Or if you prefer, we’ll buy a place near your grandfather." His eyes sparkled with plans.

"Grandfather called the other day. Said he’s tired of New York’s gossip. He’s considering moving to Skyrim with me." She fluttered her lashes playfully.

"Whatever you want." He surrendered, kissing her softly.

Breath mingled, promises sealed.

When they parted, Seraphina teased, "If we live in Skyrim, your commute will be hell. Four hours daily."

"I’ll take a chopper. Gordon can’t fly, but I can. Doesn’t matter. As long as you’re happy."

Tears glistened in her eyes. Yet, she sensed his lingering tension.

"Seraphina, you’re already planning our future. Does that mean you’ll marry me?" He pinched her cheek.

"As if." She huffed. What kind of proposal was this? So lazy!

——

Meanwhile, at the precinct, Adrian was cornered.

Isabella’s detention period was ending. Vanderbilt’s lawyers and his superiors were pressuring him to release her on bail within two hours!

Time was running out.

Sebastian strolled out of interrogation, smirking as he lounged at Adrian’s desk. "Captain Lockwood, I know you want revenge for your sister. But the law treats everyone equally. Your vendetta only proves your lack of professionalism."

"You’re calling her an innocent civilian?" Adrian’s glare could cut glass. "Sebastian, your eyes or your brain must be full of shit to spout such nonsense."

Sebastian reddened but kept his cool. "File a complaint if you dare."

Adrian scoffed. How could two brothers be so different? Julian was decent. Sebastian? A snake.

"Resisting is pointless. Two hours won’t change anything." Sebastian checked his watch. "Might as well quit and go back to being a spoiled heir."

"Even two hours—Isabella stays until the last second."

Sebastian shrugged. "Suit yourself. Doesn’t interfere with my dinner plans."

Adrian’s fists clenched under the desk.

Just then, an officer rushed in.

"Captain Lockwood! A confession!"

"About what?"

"Isabella’s case. The man claims he supplied the drugs—and has proof!"

Adrian’s pulse spiked. Sebastian froze.

"Who is he?!"

As the question hung in the air, Victor strode in, smirking.
###Chapter 460

The moment Isabella saw Nathan's disinterest, she realized his earlier words had been too crude, too lacking in finesse.

Her man, both then and now, had never given her a moment's peace. Though he couldn't help himself now, a man weighed down by his own sins hadn't even offered her a proper proposal. How could he dare dream of marriage?

The fact that she hadn't slapped him was already more grace than he deserved.

"Oh no, the soup!"

The pot on the stove boiled over, and Isabella rushed to clean the mess.

Nathan took in the bubbling pot, the steaming kettle, the carefully arranged pastries, and suddenly, his throat tightened. A tear escaped the corner of his eye, but he wiped it away before anyone could see.

He couldn't stand watching Isabella work so hard. Without bothering to change, he rolled up his sleeves and started cleaning the kitchen, setting the table with swift efficiency.

Earlier, he'd felt the urge to cry—his emotions a tangled mess of pity for her and shame for himself.

Those lost three years could have been filled with such happiness, yet he'd never appreciated them. But now, he had a second chance. From this moment on, he would cling to this hard-won joy with everything he had.

"Hey, it's been hot lately. I made lemon mint sorbet for dessert. Try it."

Isabella pinched a piece of the sweet treat and held it to Nathan's lips. He leaned in, mouth parting slightly, only for her to pull back with a playful smirk, holding the sorbet between her own lips, eyes dancing with mischief.

Nathan's gaze darkened with desire, his hand trembling as he cupped the back of her neck and caught the other half of the sorbet with his mouth.

First, he savored the cool sweetness. Then he sealed her lips with his own, swallowing her breathy moans and soft whimpers.

When they finally broke apart, Isabella was left weak-kneed, her silk gown damp and clinging to her slender waist, the outline of her body enough to haunt a man's dreams.

Nathan stared down, his gut tightening painfully.

"Sweet?" Isabella traced a finger along his sticky lips, her hand resting on his shoulder.

"Mm. But not half as sweet as you," he murmured, sucking lightly on her fingertip.

"You're getting bolder by the day," she scolded, though her voice trembled as a shiver ran through her. "Alright, let's eat before the food gets cold."

Nathan reluctantly released her, sitting properly and picking up his fork—just as Isabella's phone rang. Seeing it was Daniel, her heart leaped, and she answered immediately on speaker. "Daniel, what's going on?"

"I've got good news and bad news. Which do you want first?" His tone was unreadable.

Isabella and Nathan exchanged a glance. "Good news first."

"We finally have enough to charge Victoria. She won't escape the drug charges. First-time offenders usually get rehab, but given the amount she had, she's looking at three years minimum."

Three years was light. But no matter—this was just the beginning. The real show was yet to come.

"And the bad news?" Nathan asked, voice low.

"The reason we could charge Victoria is because Sebastian turned himself in."

Both froze. Isabella's heart clenched. "Sebastian... turned himself in?!"

"Yes. He handed over all the evidence he had on Victoria to me—and let's just say every piece of it could bring the Vanderbilt Group to its knees and send Reginald's blood pressure through the roof. Even Dominic couldn't get her out of this."

It should have been good news, but Isabella couldn't bring herself to feel happy. Nathan, sensing her distress, pulled her into his arms, voice gentle. "I know you're upset. Let's go to the precinct first. I'll reheat dinner for you later."

She nodded against his chest, brow furrowed.

Sebastian sat calmly in the interrogation room, a wall separating him from Victoria. His serene composure was a stark contrast to the woman next door, who looked like a caged animal.

"Officers, this is my confession—every detail of my crimes, and Victoria's."

Daniel studied him intently. "Sebastian, you know your charges are more severe than hers. Incitement, drug trafficking... you're facing serious time."

"I know." His expression didn't change.

"Then why?" Bound by duty, Daniel could only ask so much.

Sebastian understood the unspoken question. If he'd stayed silent, even if Victoria implicated him, without evidence, the police couldn't touch him. Yet he'd chosen to confess.

"Daniel, surely there's someone you'd sacrifice everything for. Someone you'd do anything to protect."

Daniel's eyes narrowed, Isabella's smiling face flashing in his mind.

"You have your answer. And coincidentally, it's the same as mine." A faint, genuine smile curved Sebastian's lips—the kind a young man might wear when first laying eyes on the girl he admired.

Daniel sighed. "I understand."

"No, you don't. No one can understand this kind of pure, complicated emotion." Sebastian's smile turned proud.

Soon, Isabella and Nathan arrived at the station. But to their shock, Sebastian refused to see them.

Isabella knew he was determined to sacrifice himself without looking back. The thought weighed heavily on her, guilt gnawing at her heart.

Nathan kept his arms tightly around her trembling shoulders, voice warm in her ear. "Isabella, don't panic. I'll hire the best international lawyers for Sebastian—ones who can go toe-to-toe with Dominic. We'll minimize his sentence. After he gets out, he won't have to worry about money. Even if he can't practice medicine, I'll find him another job. He won't suffer."

The words were small comfort, but with Nathan beside her, Isabella found a sliver of peace in the storm.

"Isabella, among the evidence Sebastian gave me... there's this." Daniel hesitated. "He insisted it be entered as evidence, but I'm reluctant. With or without it, Victoria's guilt is clear. But this... this would make Reginald disown her for good."

He pulled out a laptop and played a surveillance video. Though silent, the images were explosive.

Nathan inhaled sharply. They were adults, but he still wanted to shield Isabella's eyes.

On-screen, Sebastian and Victoria were entangled, Victoria straddling him, eyes closed in pleasure—completely bare.

Daniel's expression didn't flicker. After years as a detective, he'd seen worse—brains splattered, body parts in bags. This was nothing.

Isabella, however, smirked. "Well, the old witch still keeps in shape."

"Sebastian sacrificed more than we realized," Daniel muttered.

After closing the laptop, Isabella spoke firmly. "This video never existed. It can't be exposed."

Both men understood—she was protecting Sebastian's last shred of dignity. He had willingly been her pawn, never seeing himself as anything but a tool in her game. His loyalty was absolute.

"If I trample on others' self-respect to get revenge, if I profit from their pain... I'd despise myself. I won't become a slave to hatred." Her voice was tight, heart aching.

"Isabella."

The two men stood behind her, watching her delicate yet resolute silhouette, at a loss for words.

Daniel walked them out. They hadn't gone far when they ran into Dominic, his face stormy.

Nathan tightened his grip on Isabella's hand, gaze sharp as a blade. Dominic stiffened, feeling an invisible dagger at his throat.

Still, he steadied himself and sneered. "Ms. Sinclair, your connections truly are impressive."

"I'm flattered." Isabella smiled haughtily. "But what a shame, Dominic. After all your running around for Victoria, it was all for nothing. Pity."

"And isn't it true," Nathan added with a mocking raise of his brow, "that in your decade of practice, you've never lost a case? That sign outside your firm—'The Undefeated'—might need to come down tomorrow. Save yourself the embarrassment when Victoria's case goes to trial and people start smashing it for you."

Daniel chuckled behind them.

This couple matched not just in looks but in sharp tongues. Was it from all the kissing they shared wits?

Dominic seethed. The case wasn't huge—just drug charges. But a loss would tarnish his golden reputation, his standing in the legal community, and most of all, in Reginald's eyes.

He had never lost. He couldn't stand the thought.

Bristling, he spat, "Ms. Sinclair, I underestimated you. With your family's influence, I expected force. But to see how you make men sell themselves out for you, bend over backward—"

Isabella remained calm. If she couldn't handle petty insults, how would she run a billion-dollar empire?

But the two men beside her were no longer calm—especially Nathan, fists clenched, face frosty with rage.

Seeing Nathan provoked, and knowing he couldn't do much in a police station, Dominic grew bolder. "Hah! Mr. Prescott, you're lucky. Next time you face a tough opponent, just have Ms. Sinclair step in. With one look from her, which tycoon wouldn't fall at her feet? Whatever you want would come pouring in—"

"Ah!"

His arrogance lasted five seconds before darkness swallowed his vision. Pain, numbness, and stars exploded behind his eyes as he crashed to the ground.

"Nathan?!"

Isabella's eyes widened, staring at the tall, icy figure before her, heart pounding.

Even Daniel was stunned. He hadn't even seen Nathan move before Dominic was on the floor. He needed to review the surveillance footage—that move was incredible!

"Nathan! This is a police station! How dare you hit me?!" Clutching his possibly broken nose, tears and blood streaming, Dominic shouted, "I'll sue you for assault! I will!"

"Hit a person? I hit what's clearly a dog." Nathan cracked his knuckles, looking down coldly. "No, calling you a dog insults dogs. You're nothing but a beast."

Dominic trembled, fury and fear warring inside him. He was no nobody—he was a renowned attorney, heir to the Dempsey family. When had he ever been humiliated like this?

So he deliberately raised his voice, drawing officers' attention. "The Vanderbilt Group's president abuses his power, assaults innocent citizens, and spews insults—in a police station, no less! Nathan, don't think your wealth lets you do whatever you want! Attacking here shows contempt for the law!"

"Dominic, listen carefully." Nathan's gaze was a blade to his heart, voice icy. "You have a problem with me? Come at me. But if you so much as whisper one word against my woman, I swear—even if I end up in prison, I'll make you pay. Next time, I'll rip out that filthy tongue of yours and flush it. Don't believe me? Try me."

Dominic's eyes bulged, tongue stiffening with fear.

Isabella stepped forward, cradling Nathan's hand, blowing softly on his reddened knuckles. "You used too much force. Your hand is swollen."

"It's nothing," he said softly.

She met his gaze, eyes sparkling, then turned to Dominic with a mocking laugh. "If you end up in the slammer, I'll have to throw a few punches myself. I'd be so bored without you—I'd have to keep you company."

Daniel's jaw dropped. Were they flirting mid-fight? This couple's thought process was beyond him.

Dominic forgot his pain, utterly dumbfounded. What did they think he was—some kind of toy?!

Just then, hurried footsteps approached.

"Nathan! What the hell are you doing?!"

Nathan's head snapped up, his expression turning to ice.
###Chapter 461

Frederic's gaze burned into his rebellious son, his expression darker than a thunderstorm.

Trailing behind him, along with his trusted aide Dennis and a squad of bodyguards, was Glynnis—her face twisted as if she'd swallowed something vile.

Truth be told, Glynnis would rather be anywhere else than here, forced to face Evadne. She hadn't left the Windermere Estate since the scandal at the horse race.

Elspeth, her own mother, had dragged their family name through the mud!

These days, even glancing at the TV made her cringe. A quick scroll through social media, and there they were—endless jabs and sneers about Elspeth.

She'd muted every gossip group, but the whispers never stopped.

[Honestly, I feel bad for Evadne. Frederic probably hasn’t touched her in years. Who else would be so desperate to pleasure themselves like that?]

[Once you’ve had kids, men treat you like furniture. Even Elspeth, with her glamorous past, couldn’t escape that fate.]

[It’s not about age—Elspeth’s on drugs, wetting herself in public. If I were Frederic, I’d die of shame. What a disgrace!]

[The real victim here is Glynnis. No decent suitors, and now her mother’s been hauled off by the cops in broad daylight.]

[What respectable family would want to marry into that mess? Embarrassing.]

Her so-called "friends" had no qualms about kicking her while she was down. Frenemies, more like.

But now, Glynnis had to play the devoted daughter. No matter how Frederic felt about Elspeth, she needed to prove she was the better child—far superior to that simpleton Mari.

She had just witnessed Thaddeus punch Cedric, their heated exchange clear to everyone present. Inside, she smirked.

Go ahead, Thaddeus. Make a fool of yourself for that woman. The more you disappoint Dad, the easier it’ll be for me to snatch that CEO position from under you.

"What am I doing? You saw it clearly enough," Thaddeus said, his voice icy and unyielding, his sharp gaze narrowing with authority.

"Haven’t you realized where you are? This is a police precinct! Hitting someone makes you no better than a common thug. Disgraceful! Foolish!"

Frederic had recently softened slightly toward his son, feeling a pang of guilt for how he'd treated Cynthia. But seeing him now, reckless and impulsive for Evadne’s sake, made his blood boil.

The officers around them, including Aaron, exchanged disdainful glances at the Abernathy patriarch’s hypocrisy.

"What kind of leader is this? He runs a corporation? Pathetic."

"Hitting someone is wrong, but for him, it’s all about saving face, not morality. His priorities are twisted."

"Elites like him are parasites. No conscience at all."

Frederic wasn’t deaf. He caught snippets of their whispers, his fury mounting as he glared at Thaddeus.

"I know exactly who I am," Thaddeus said without hesitation, returning to Evadne’s side and gripping her hand firmly.

His piercing gaze softened as he looked at her. "I’m the man of the Ashbourne family’s eldest daughter. My woman was insulted by this dog. Hitting him—was that not justified?"

Evadne’s heart skipped a beat, her fingers curling into his.

"You—!" Frederic was stunned.

"If it were your woman being humiliated by such filth, could you stay silent?" Thaddeus smirked coldly. "But of course, your pride comes first. You’d never stoop to defend anyone."

The crowd gasped. The Ashbourne-Abernathy feud had escalated into open war.

Frederic was speechless, but Glynnis stepped forward, defending her father. "Thaddeus, how dare you speak to Dad like that?! You’re in the wrong for fighting, and you’ve tarnished the company’s reputation. What’s wrong with Dad reprimanding you?! Are you going to degrade yourself until everyone despises you—all for a woman?!"

Evadne clenched her jaw, hating to see Thaddeus chastised by someone like Glynnis. But this was an Abernathy family matter. Though she and Thaddeus were committed, interfering would only worsen the rift between father and son.

She didn’t fear Frederic’s disdain—but she feared for Thaddeus, already walking on thin ice at the Abernathy Group.

"Hated by everyone? You must be talking about Elspeth," Thaddeus said, not even glancing at Glynnis, his voice laced with lethal calm. "I suggest you behave. If you keep whitewashing your mother’s crimes, I’ll make sure you join her behind bars."

His words weren’t just for Glynnis—they were a warning to Frederic. Elspeth was beyond saving.

"Thaddeus! How dare you!" Glynnis stomped her foot, clutching Frederic’s arm, tears welling. "Dad! He’s threatening to kill Mom—your wife! He wants to destroy us both! What did I ever do to him? Who’s the real monster here?!"

Frederic, dizzy from her theatrics, barely managed a response.

"Mr. Frederic Abernathy."

Cedric saw the father-son rift as his golden opportunity.

Scrambling to his feet, wiping blood from his nose, he put on a pitiful expression. "Mr. Frederic Abernathy, I’ve been utterly devoted to you and the Abernathy Group. I’ve worked tirelessly, given my all. You know this. I understand the bad blood between Mr. Thaddeus and your wife, but as a lawyer, I was just doing my job. Yet Mr. Thaddeus took his grudge out on me. I’ve been wronged!"

Frederic couldn’t bear to look at Cedric’s bloody face. "Mr. Dempsey, I’ll handle this."

Thaddeus was done with everything Abernathy-related.

"Evadne, let’s go home."

He couldn’t stand sharing the same air as Frederic. Taking Evadne’s hand, they walked out, ignoring the stares.

As they passed Cedric, Thaddeus paused. "Send your medical bills to my secretary. Getting punched by me isn’t an everyday privilege—make sure you claim generously."

Cedric’s face twisted in rage, his wounds throbbing.

Evadne followed Thaddeus, her eyes fixed on his broad shoulders, stepping lightly behind him.

Aaron watched, stunned. His sister—bold, fearless, radiant—was now the picture of gentle femininity beside Thaddeus. A sight worth capturing.

"Ms. Ashbourne."

Frederic’s cold voice stopped them.

Thaddeus immediately tensed, pulling Evadne protectively against him.

"Mr. Abernathy, is there something else?" Evadne asked, her tone neutral.

"Do you dare claim the scandal at the horse race, Elspeth’s arrest, and that doctor’s testimony had nothing to do with you?" Frederic’s voice was tight with fury.

Thaddeus frowned. "If you have something to say, say it to me. Don’t drag Evadne into this."

But Evadne, unshaken, smiled disarmingly. "Of course it had to do with me. Everything did."

The crowd gasped. Even Thaddeus was surprised by her bluntness.

Glynnis seized the moment. "Evadne! It was you all along! You framed my mother! I knew she was innocent! How could you be so cruel?! You’ve torn our family apart and now you’re manipulating my brother! You’re a disaster!"

Aaron nearly stepped forward, but Evadne remained composed. "Mr. Abernathy, Victor works for me. But your wife sought him out for drugs, got addicted, and acted recklessly at the horse race—all by choice. No one forced her. It was a trap, but Elspeth could’ve walked away from the start."

With that, Thaddeus wrapped his arm around her, and they left.

"Dad! You’re letting her go?! She’s the one who ruined Mom!" Glynnis wailed.

Dennis finally spoke up. "Ms. Ashbourne’s words require proof. Without evidence, you risk a defamation lawsuit."

Glynnis shot him a venomous glare.

"Aaron, I need to see your Chief," Frederic demanded coldly.

Aaron leaned against the wall, arms crossed. "The Chief’s out. Someone higher up called him."

"Then call him. Tell him to see me immediately."

"Sorry, but as a lowly officer, I don’t have that kind of pull." Aaron yawned. "Call him yourself."

Frederic’s fury spiked. He knew Aaron was Emeric Ashbourne’s son—Evadne’s brother. Of course he wouldn’t help.

Hmph. A bastard child—just as low-class as expected.

Glynnis kept crying. "Dad, Evadne’s humiliating us! Are we just going to let her walk all over the Abernathy name?!"

"Never."

Frederic’s face turned ashen, his teeth grinding. "I know what she wants. She thinks she can marry Thaddeus again. I’ll never allow such a scheming woman into this family. Even if my father supports her, it won’t matter!"

In the car, Evadne nestled against Thaddeus, tracing circles on his chest.

"Don’t keep defying your father for me."

"Don’t worry," Thaddeus murmured, kissing her forehead.

"Frederic Abernathy still controls the Abernathy Group. Aren’t you afraid he’ll strip you of your position and hand everything to your brother?"

"If he casts me aside, I’ll just have to rely on you to support me," Thaddeus said with a wry smile.

"The Ashbourne family doesn’t take freeloaders," Evadne teased, arching a brow.

"I can pull my weight. I’m very capable," he replied, his muscles flexing under her touch.

"Oh? How capable?"

Thaddeus lifted her onto his lap, his gaze darkening. "You’ll find out when we get home."

Evadne’s cheeks flushed as she pulled him into a deep kiss.

The car stopped at the villa.

Gordon stepped out first to open the door—only to freeze at the sight of a sleek Rolls-Royce parked at the entrance.

Just as Thaddeus carried Evadne out, the Rolls-Royce’s door swung open.

"Evadne."

Both stiffened. Evadne’s eyes widened before she quickly slid out of Thaddeus’s arms.

"Dad?!"
###Chapter 462

Thaddeus inclined his head in a respectful bow, the perfect balance of deference from a younger man.

Even though this elder had made his life difficult before—putting him through uncomfortable situations—his love for Evadne and deep admiration for Chairman Ashbourne's integrity kept him humble. But his humility was nothing like Avery's desperate, fawning eagerness.

"Chairman Ashbourne, the night air is chilly. You should take care not to catch a cold."

His presence was like sunlight without heat, a powerful current beneath still waters. Reflecting on it now, it felt unexpectedly pleasant, like standing in a soft breeze.

Emeric gave a slight nod.

The absence of his usual bodyguards sent Evadne's heart racing with worry. She rushed forward. "Dad, why didn’t you bring anyone with you? Coming here alone—what if something happened?"

"Mr. Lyle is perfectly capable. Besides, it's late, and I didn’t want to disturb their rest." Emeric glanced around the villa. "I wanted to see for myself how my daughter is living here in Elmsworth. To check if this place is comfortable enough for her."

He surveyed the space. "Small, but well-appointed. Not spacious, but cozy."

"You didn’t pick the lock to get in, did you?" Evadne’s cheeks burned, her tone sharp with mock indignation.

Her embarrassment stemmed from the fact that this villa had become her and Thaddeus’s private sanctuary, filled with traces of their shared life.

"Do you really think I’d resort to breaking in?"

Emeric feigned offense, his expression darkening. "Didn’t you hire a housekeeper? She let me in, served me tea and pastries. I had a few—they were quite good. Mr. Lyle packed the rest to take with us."

Mr. Lyle shook the clear container in his hand.

"How could you! Those were for Thaddeus—leave them alone!"

Evadne stomped her foot, reaching out to snatch the treats, but Thaddeus caught her wrist. "You have three women waiting on you hand and foot, and Thaddeus only has me! He hasn’t even tried them yet—how can you just take them?"

"Evadne, it’s fine." Thaddeus pulled her closer, amusement flickering in his eyes.

"Tsk, no harm in letting your old man enjoy them. If he wants more, you can make them anytime." Emeric guarded the container like a lion protecting its prey. "But for me to get a taste, I had to come all the way to Elmsworth. I’m keeping them!"

Later?

The couple exchanged glances, startled.

Emeric’s attitude toward Thaddeus had shifted subtly. Before, it had felt like he wanted to chase them off with a stick every day. But tonight, not only was he less harsh, his words carried a hint of something more.

Thaddeus’s pulse quickened, his palms dampening. But he didn’t dare hope too much—even this small thaw was enough for him.

In the end, Evadne lost the battle. All her afternoon efforts, barely tasted by her man, were now claimed by her father. Infuriating!

"Hey, kid, you seem lively. Your back must be better?" Emeric asked, genuine concern in his voice.

"It’s fine. I’m not that fragile," Evadne said, lifting her chin defiantly.

"Evadne, don’t push yourself. A sprain takes longer to heal than a break."

Thaddeus frowned, calling her out. "Last night, you were in so much pain you couldn’t sleep. Why don’t you tell your father the truth?"

"It’s not like that. You talk too much." Evadne bit her lip, elbowing him lightly.

Emeric watched their playful exchange, warmth spreading through his chest like he’d been hit by a barrage of candy-coated shells. Even Mr. Lyle, standing behind him, couldn’t suppress a smile.

"Mr. Abernathy, Evadne is injured. I know you’re looking after her, but as a CEO, your schedule is packed. You can’t be with her every moment." Emeric’s tone turned serious. "I’m worried about leaving her without proper care, so I’d like to take her home for a few days to recover."

The lighthearted mood vanished.

"I’m not going back. Who says I don’t have anyone to look after me? Alva, the assistant Thaddeus found, takes excellent care of me!" Evadne crossed her arms, pouting.

Thaddeus stood silently beside her, his grip on her waist tightening slightly.

Logically, he knew she’d be better cared for at home. But the thought of being apart from her was unbearable. Every moment with her was precious, and he cherished her with everything he had.

Even a single day without her would be agony.

Seeing her stubbornness, Emeric turned to Thaddeus, his expression grave. "Mr. Abernathy, my daughter may have married you, but you’re no longer together. Given your backgrounds, it’s inappropriate for you to live like this. If you truly see a future with Evadne, it should develop naturally, not rushed. Don’t you agree?"

Thaddeus took a deep breath, tenderness and hesitation warring within him as he gently nudged Evadne toward her father.

"Evadne, go home with your father for now. Rest well."

"You’re sending me away?" Her brows knitted together, her voice trembling like an abandoned kitten’s.

"Silly girl, I’m not sending you away. I’m doing what’s best for you." His voice caught, his heart aching at her pitiful expression.

"Will you come to Skyrim to see me?" Her lips quivered.

"Of course. I’ll come in a few days."

But in truth, he wouldn’t last a single day. He’d want to leave for Skyrim at dawn, even if it meant standing outside the gates of Silverlake Harbor just to be closer to her.

Emeric felt an inexplicable pang of guilt, but his worry for Evadne outweighed it.

After all, she had just provoked the Abernathy and Fairhaven families—and one of the Fairhaven dogs had bitten her. Who knew what they might do next? The thought kept him awake at night.

In the end, Evadne climbed into the car with her father. The night was deep, the air heavy with dew as Thaddeus stood in the wind, watching the luxury vehicle disappear into the distance.

Only when it was out of sight did he lower his head, fists clenched, tears misting his eyes.

Gordon, sensing his distress, murmured, "Mr. Abernathy, don’t worry. Mrs. Abernathy just went home—she hasn’t left for good. Absence makes the heart grow fonder, right?"

Thaddeus’s vision blurred, his voice rough. "I know. I just feel like I failed to take care of her."

The Rolls-Royce glided through the night toward Skyrim.

In the back seat, Evadne nestled against her father, silent for a long while. Emeric patted her shoulder gently, his voice warm. "Evadne, are you mad at me?"

She shook her head. "I know you’re looking out for me."

A pause. Then soft sobs, damp warmth seeping into his shirt.

"Evadne? Are you crying?"

"Dad. I miss Thaddeus. I miss him so much."

It had been years since she’d cried in his arms like this. Emeric’s heart ached, his own eyes growing moist.

He hadn’t felt this way since Debby married and left for Helgen.

Seeing how deeply Evadne and Thaddeus loved each other, it felt like the young man had carved a piece of his flesh away. The pain, the reluctance—only a father could understand.

"My Evadne, I really can’t hold onto you anymore."

Back home, Evadne locked herself in her room, wrapped in a quilt, chatting with Thaddeus on the phone.

She chattered endlessly, like a little songbird. On the other end, he listened patiently, occasionally agreeing or adding his thoughts.

Two souls in sync, their values aligned—there was never a shortage of topics. Eventually, her words slowed, and without realizing it, she drifted off to sleep.

The next morning, she rubbed her bleary eyes and stretched.

"Seems like you slept well."

Evadne gasped, flipping over to grab her still-lit phone. "Thaddeus?! Why are you still on the line?!"

His voice was hoarse, clearly exhausted. "Last night, you went quiet. I figured you’d fallen asleep."

"So you—?"

"I didn’t want to hang up. Hearing you snore is a rare treat." He chuckled lightly.

Her cheeks flushed. "You’re lying! I don’t snore! A beauty doesn’t snore!"

"Alright, my mistake." He yawned.

"You should sleep. Staying up all night must’ve drained you." Her heart ached for him.

"By the way, Evadne, we’ll see each other soon. William and his son are hosting a gala at their castle this weekend. All four families are invited, including your father. We’ll meet then."

"A gala? Must be for some big announcement." Her eyes sparkled.

"Likely finalizing a business deal."

"Your father must be under a lot of pressure lately. He won’t pass up a chance to collaborate with J Corp."

"Elspeth’s mess has him spread too thin to focus on William."

Thaddeus’s voice darkened. "But I can’t say what Chad might be planning."

"Thaddeus, even if your brother is recovering abroad, don’t underestimate him. His debut with J Corp means he’s bound to make a comeback."

"Evadne, are you really afraid I’ll become a kept man?" He teased.

"I’m serious!"

"I’m not afraid of him coming back. If he wants to reclaim what’s his fairly, I have no objections."

The abduction years ago still haunted him. He owed Chad.

"But if he plays dirty, I won’t stand by. Ashbourne Group should win this race. If William is decent, he’ll choose you without hesitation. But if Chad or others try anything, I won’t just watch."

His deep, resonant voice soothed her. "With me here, you’ve got nothing to worry about."

Myra hadn’t gone on vacation as she’d claimed. Instead, she stayed home, caring for Emeric and cooking for the family.

Her life, untouched by Elspeth’s downfall, remained peaceful. She appreciated Evadne’s revenge but, with a loving husband and daughter, hatred no longer weighed on her.

Evadne savored the tonic soup Myra had prepared, drinking every drop. The women of the house gathered around, relieved to see her in good spirits.

"Looks like that boy is taking good care of you."

Aviana propped her chin on her hand, shaking her head admiringly. "Hearing you talk, I’m impressed with Thaddeus. A pampered young master turned doting househusband just for you—that’s no small sacrifice."

"Absolutely. Emeric would never stoop to that. He’s far too proud." Suri chuckled.

Evadne smirked, feeling like she’d hit the jackpot.

"Evadne, be patient a little longer. I think Emeric is warming up to the idea of you and Mr. Abernathy. His pride is just too big—he hasn’t found a graceful way to back down yet."

Myra’s words sent a shock of delight through the room.

"Really?!"

"Emeric had his sights set on Mr. Avery Chambers for you, always trying to push you together. But after the last race, I think he’s softened toward Mr. Abernathy. He made it clear to Mr. Chambers that day—he won’t interfere in your relationship anymore. He’s letting nature take its course."

Evadne’s heart soared. Finally, the clouds had parted!

"Mrs. Myra Ashbourne, Ms. Nydia and Mr. Jason have arrived. They’re waiting in the living room."

Myra’s expression stiffened slightly. "I’ll be right there."

"Something wrong?" Evadne, ever observant, noticed her discomfort.

Myra hesitated, but Aviana blurted out, "Jason and Nydia’s relationship reached Emeric’s ears. He doesn’t approve. And with Jason’s older brother representing Elspeth as her lawyer, and their father backing the Abernathy Group, Emeric is even more displeased."
###Chapter 463

"What's Emeric's issue? Why drag Jason into Cedric's mess?"

Isabella slammed her palm on the table, ready to storm out, but Olivia caught her wrist. "Don't. This isn't your battle. Getting involved will only infuriate your father."

"Jason is my closest friend, and Nydia is my sister. How can I stand by?" Isabella's voice trembled with frustration. She knew the sting of forbidden love all too well—she wouldn't let Nydia suffer the same fate.

Being the Sinclair heiress didn’t grant her immunity to heartbreak. Jason was just a secretary, and Nydia, though sweet, lacked the backbone to defy their family. Their love was a fragile boat in a storm.

"Stop being stubborn," Sophia interjected, gripping Isabella's arm. "Your father’s finally warming up to Alexander. Don’t ruin this peace. If you provoke him now, he might take it out on Alexander."

"And Nydia is Olivia’s daughter," Vanessa added quietly. "It’s not your place to interfere."

Isabella exhaled sharply, returning to the table to gulp down a bowl of soup, forcing herself to calm down.

When Olivia stepped out to see her daughter, Isabella followed.

In the living room, Jason and Nydia sat side by side, fingers entwined, their gazes locked in silent adoration. The sight made Isabella’s heart swell—pink bubbles of joy nearly escaping her lips.

"Jason, Nydia. Long time no see."

The couple sprang to their feet. Nydia, cheeks flushed, whispered, "Sis, how are you? Is your injury healed?"

"Completely. Especially after seeing you two."

"Mrs. Sinclair, Ms. Sinclair." Jason bowed gracefully, every inch the polished gentleman. Even in love, he never forgot his place.

"Jason, how’s your recovery?" Isabella asked, concern lacing her tone.

"Fully healed. Thank you for your concern, Ms. Sinclair." His words were for her, but his tender gaze never left Nydia’s face.

"Since you’re here—"

"Nydia, go upstairs. I need to speak with Jason alone." Olivia’s calm interruption sliced through the moment.

With a worried glance at Jason, Nydia obeyed, climbing the stairs silently.

Jason’s eyes lingered on her retreating figure before Olivia’s voice cooled. "Jason, you know Chairman Sinclair’s stance. He doesn’t approve. And neither do I."

Isabella stiffened. Olivia, usually so gentle, was unyielding when it came to her children’s futures.

"Mrs. Sinclair, I love Nydia." Jason stood rigid, his steady voice cracking. "Please. Give me a chance to prove myself."

Olivia shook her head. "Jason, I’ve known you since your days at Silverlake Harbor. I don’t doubt your sincerity. But love alone isn’t enough. There are... practical considerations."

Her words hit like boulders, crushing the hope in Jason’s eyes.

Without another word, Olivia turned to leave. Isabella chased after her, gripping her hand. "Olivia, why? You’ve always praised Jason. What changed?"

"I like him. But liking someone and welcoming him as a son-in-law are different." Olivia’s voice was soft but sharp. "Your father accepted Jason as family because he admires him. But the Dempseys’ recent actions have angered him. Emeric isn’t a snob, but he won’t let Nydia marry into a family with questionable values. We agree on this."

"Olivia, Cedric is Cedric! He doesn’t represent the entire Dempsey family!" Isabella pleaded desperately.

"Our decision stands. Nydia is too young for marriage. We’ll revisit this later." Olivia walked away, leaving Isabella reeling.

Emeric’s stubbornness was expected. But Olivia’s sudden shift? It felt like a silent pact had been made.

"Ms. Sinclair." Jason’s voice was hollow.

Isabella turned, guilt gnawing at her. "You heard everything?"

"Thank you for caring about us." Jason forced a smile. "We’ll take it slow. As long as we stay true to each other, one day—"

One day. But how long would that take? His voice broke, unable to finish.

Isabella’s heart ached. She gripped his shoulder. "Jason, your road won’t be easy. Nydia is timid, and Olivia has little sway at home. Your brother crossed Emeric, and now the Dempseys are under fire. It’s understandable."

"Cedric stopped being my brother the moment he sided with Elspeth." Jason’s jaw clenched. "If my father continues to ignore his actions, I’ll sever ties with the Dempseys. For good."

"Don’t be rash," Isabella warned. "Extreme measures won’t help. Alexander and I will handle Cedric. He’s still your parents’ golden child. Crushing them won’t solve anything."

Jason’s eyes welled with unshed tears.

"You value family, like me. I won’t let you become the villain." Isabella’s gaze burned with determination. "I’ll fight for you and Nydia. Even if it means I’m the one who gets burned."

Meanwhile, at the Dempsey residence.

"My god! What happened to your nose?!" Mrs. Dempsey shrieked.

Cedric, nursing a broken nose courtesy of Alexander, scowled. The hospital said he might lose his sense of smell—not that he could tell right from wrong anyway. The humiliation was unbearable.

"Who did this to you?!" Mrs. Dempsey clutched her chest. "You’re a respected lawyer!"

"Someone we can’t afford to provoke," Cedric muttered darkly.

Dave Dempsey’s expression darkened. "You’ve been working with the Abernathys lately. Did Evadne do this?"

"Alexander threw the punch, but it was Evadne’s doing." Cedric’s teeth ground together. "They’re two sides of the same coin."

"That Sinclair girl has gone too far!" Mrs. Dempsey trembled with rage. "After all we’ve done for them! Your father was Minister of Justice! Jason serves their family! And this is how they repay us?!"

"The Sinclairs think they can trample us now that I’ve retired," Dave seethed. "And Jason wants to marry their bastard daughter? Unacceptable!"

Cedric’s ears perked up. "Jason’s serious about that Ashbourne girl?"

"Your brother’s lost his mind," Mrs. Dempsey spat. "That girl is beneath him. The Sinclairs’ leftovers."

Cedric smirked inwardly. If Jason married Nydia, he’d rise above them all. That couldn’t happen.

"Jason’s a top law graduate. Why settle for less?" Cedric feigned concern. "Once Chairman Sinclair discards Myra and her daughter, where does that leave him? Supporting them? We’d be a laughingstock!"

The Dempseys exchanged uneasy glances.

Cedric hid his satisfaction. Crushing Jason and Nydia would hurt Evadne—and that alone brought him joy.

That evening, Jeff Lyle hosted Emeric at his private club.

"Mr. Lyle, inform Olivia and Nydia they’ll accompany me tonight," Emeric instructed his tailor, his expression troubled. "And keep this from Isabella."

Inside the lavish private room, Jeff wasn’t alone. Avery and a recovering Byron Chambers sat with him. Byron’s glare could melt steel.

"Avery, why the death stare? Want a toast?" Avery raised his glass, then smirked. "Ah, right. Doctor’s orders—no alcohol for you. My bad."

Byron’s fists clenched. Thanks to Evadne, he’d kept his leg, but the phantom pains were relentless. And his prosthetic was a constant reminder of Avery’s betrayal.

"Avery. Enough," Jeff warned, though his tone lacked its usual bite.

"Dad, I’m just concerned." Avery spread his hands innocently. "But I get it. If I were in his shoes, I’d be bitter too."

"Avery!" Byron slammed the table.

The door opened.

Emeric entered, followed by Olivia and Nydia—but no Isabella.

Avery’s hopeful smile vanished.
###Chapter 464

"Hey? Alexander, where's Isabella?" Harrison craned his neck, peering outside with persistent curiosity.

"She won't be joining us tonight, Harrison. Isabella is injured and needs her rest. I've told her to stay put and recover," Alexander replied with a nonchalant shrug.

"Alexander, you're being unfair, man. You promised to bring Isabella over this time. Besides, we're practically family now, not just guests!" Harrison rambled on, though confusion gnawed at him inside.

Alexander settled into his seat. "If you really care about Isabella, you should let her heal properly. No need to drag her around."

It was just before that horse race that he'd met with Alexander in private.

They had hit it off, and Alexander seemed quite taken with his son, assuring him that he would support the union between Isabella and Nathaniel, welcoming Isabella into the Prescott family as a daughter-in-law.

He had also pondered Sebastian's marriage prospects, his beloved second son, second only to his eldest in his affections.

He was angling for a double celebration, hoping to propose to Alexander and Margaret's daughter Seraphina on behalf of Sebastian.

Originally, he didn't think Seraphina was a match for Sebastian given her modest background.

But now that Sebastian was down to one good leg, he wasn't in a position to be choosy, and Ms. Seraphina suddenly seemed much more appealing. That was why he'd eagerly brought Sebastian along tonight, to meet with Seraphina.

But what he couldn't fathom was why Alexander, who had virtually handpicked Nathaniel as his son-in-law, had come without Isabella and with a noticeably cooler demeanor.

Nathaniel, his interest thoroughly extinguished, downed a glass of bourbon in frustration.

Tonight, the unsuspecting Seraphina was a vision in an elegant white dress that highlighted her flawless porcelain skin. Her dancer's physique was lithe and graceful as a swan, and her exposed legs were as perfect as a sculpted masterpiece.

Usually, Isabella's stunning beauty and presence overshadowed Seraphina.

But now, it was clear that both sisters were beauties in their own right, reminiscent of the classic novel's contrasting heroines, like the fair and virtuous Amy and the fiery and passionate Jo.

Sebastian, having spent too much time in the hospital and away from female company aside from nurses, couldn't take his eyes off Seraphina.

Nathaniel, reading his less-than-pure thoughts with a glance, couldn't help but suppress a cold, mocking smile.

The feast was served, and Alexander barely touched his food, seemingly without an appetite.

Seraphina sat next to Sebastian, who was diligently attentive, serving her food and pouring her drinks, but she only responded with polite reserve, leaving the food he offered untouched.

In Seraphina's heart and eyes, there was only room for her dear Jason. Other men barely warranted a second glance.

"Alexander, now that the race's over, about the arrangement we discussed."

Before Harrison could finish, Alexander finally spoke up with a grave tone. "Harrison, I know how much you adore Isabella. You've practically raised her alongside your daughter. And I'm aware of Nathaniel's esteem for her, and he's shown nothing but respect and diligence, qualities I admire in a young man. But feelings can't be forced. Isabella has given her heart to another, and you know very well who that is."

His words caught the Prescott men completely off guard.

Nathaniel's eyes flashed with anger, a dangerous red mingling with the fury, his handsome features tight as if carved from ice. Even without a word, his presence was chilling.

Sebastian couldn't help but snicker at the sight of his brother's displeasure.

He thought, Nathaniel, dreaming of marrying into the Sinclair family and becoming Alexander's favored son-in-law to leverage control over the Prescott Group against your brother? Dream on, you moron!

"Alexander, what are you implying? Didn't we have an agreement?"

Harrison's brows knitted together as his temper flared, and for the first time, he turned red-faced with Alexander. "We've been friends for over thirty years. How do you think I've treated you? Better than your own brothers! When you were targeted for assassination, with a sniper lurking on a rooftop, I stood in front of you without knowing where the shooter was, ready to take a bullet for you!"

Alexander listened silently, the harrowing memory of that life-or-death shootout resurfacing.

They were young then, kindred spirits with a brotherly bond. Harrison had risked his life for him, a testament to their genuine friendship.

He truly was grateful to Harrison.

And it was that same event that had led to his fortuitous rescue by the daughter of S-Star Group's magnate, Aviana, leading to their marriage.

"Indeed, Harrison, I will never forget your kindness in this lifetime," Alexander's voice was hoarse with emotion.

"Seems you've forgotten everything! Otherwise, you wouldn't go back on your word and make a fool out of me!"

Harrison's anger escalated as he grabbed a crystal glass from the table and hurled it to the floor, his face crimson with rage.

Seraphina and Margaret were shocked.

They had never seen Harrison so furious with Alexander, who usually joked around with him. It was evident how much he prized this potential alliance, enough to risk a fallout with a brother of over three decades.

"Dad, mind your health. Don't get too worked up."

Both Prescott sons stood up in alarm, but Sebastian's injured leg delayed him, and Nathaniel reached their father first.

Nathaniel gently soothed Harrison's heaving back, comforting him with care. "Dad, please calm down. You and Mr. Alexander have been close for decades, a bond forged through trials and tribulations that even us younger folks envy. Please, don't let my marriage prospects come between you. If that happened, I'd be the villain of the century, living with guilt forever."

"Nathaniel, don't blame yourself. This situation has nothing to do with you."

Harrison sighed heavily, slapping his thigh in frustration. "I'm a failure as a father. After all these years, I still couldn't outdo the Vanderbilt Group and be New York's top dog. Mr. Alexander, I understand why you look down on our family's standing. You want to ally with the mighty Vanderbilts, and I get it."

"Dad, don't say that. It's not your fault. It's mine."

Nathaniel forced a wry smile, his eyes brimming with pain. "It's because I couldn't win Isabella's love. It's just that Isabella and I are star-crossed. Mr. Alexander is right. You can't force love. If that's the case, then I wish Isabella and Mr. Thaddeus a lifetime of happiness together."

The phrase "lifetime" rang in his ears, sounding bitterly harsh.

"So be it. I understand now."

Harrison rose angrily, his gaze at Alexander filled with utter disappointment. "Chairman Alexander, since you have made your choice, I have nothing left to say. All good things come to an end. Chairman Alexander, from now on, we are rivals. We'll see what the future holds! Sebastian, Nathaniel, let's go!"

"Harrison, wait."

Alexander's brow furrowed deeply as he stood up slowly and approached him. "I've always favored Nathaniel as a son-in-law for the Sinclair family. I hoped our families could be united through marriage. But at the horse racing event, as you saw, the whole nation witnessed Isabella and Thaddeus's relationship. It's practically public now. Talking marriage at this point would tarnish both the Prescott Group and your son's reputation."

Harrison fell into deep thought.

Nathaniel adjusted his glasses, casting a cold, swift glance at Alexander.

What was this sly old man up to? Why did it feel like he was secretly trying to set up Isabella with Thaddeus?

Why this?

"Seraphina," Alexander suddenly called out to Seraphina.

"Yes, Daddy?" Seraphina snapped out of her daze and obediently walked over to her father.

Alexander's piercing gaze settled on her and then shifted back to Harrison. "Seraphina is my youngest daughter, the apple of our eye. We've been searching for the right match for her. Initially, I hoped she would marry into the Prescott family, but you were set on Isabella, and I had to make other arrangements for Seraphina. Now that Isabella is dating Mr. Thaddeus, let's sit down and discuss a potential marriage between your son and my little girl. After she graduates, Seraphina could be your daughter-in-law. What do you think?"

The room seemed to explode with that suggestion, like lightning striking Seraphina's head!

She trembled, her crystal-like eyes shrinking, her face draining of color. "Daddy?"

Suddenly, Margaret grabbed her arm, her fingers digging into Seraphina's flesh.

Seraphina looked anxiously at her mother, who was shaking her head.

In the end, she could only lower her head in resignation, tears swirling in her eyes.

Alexander's proposal to align Seraphina with the Prescott family mended the fracturing relationship between the two families.

But Nathaniel, anxious and furious, excused himself and stormed onto the dark, empty balcony to pace.

He breathed heavily, red-eyed and furious, his fists pounding against the railing, swollen and red, yet unable to quell the rage in his heart.

What to do, what to do?

It wasn't Isabella but Seraphina as a consolation.

Harrison's true desire was to marry into a powerful alliance that would dominate New York, even if it wasn't Isabella.

But now, Sebastian was crippled.

Alexander would never marry his daughter to a disabled man, so the burden of the alliance would inevitably fall on Nathaniel.

He couldn't possibly marry anyone but Isabella!

"Nathaniel, all your schemes and yet you've played yourself. Isn't this what they call 'all dressed up and nowhere to go'?"

Sebastian hobbled over, his grin stretching ear to ear upon seeing Nathaniel trapped by his own ploys. "You were so set on marrying Isabella, pulling out all the stops, and still you ended up being defeated by Thaddeus. Ms. Isabella and Thaddeus have both been married before. She'd rather go back to him than be with you. How pathetic is that, huh?"

Nathaniel's face turned a sickly shade of pale with rage, his fingers clawing at the railing.

Suddenly, when Nathaniel recalled Sebastian's fawning over Seraphina, an idea sparked in his mind, and he smirked. "Sebastian, how can you mock me? Better worry about yourself. You're crippled now, can't manage much of the family business, and Dad's losing patience with you. Your only chance to turn things around is a good marriage alliance. But even the Sinclair's least desirable daughter, Chairman Alexander wouldn't want to marry her off to you. Of course, if I were Chairman Alexander, I wouldn't want my daughter marrying a cripple either."

"Who are you calling a cripple? Say that again!" Sebastian bellowed, his eyes bloodshot with fury.

"Even if I can't marry the Sinclair heiress, securing a union with Ms. Seraphina of the Sinclair family isn't such a bad deal. Either way, I'll be Chairman Alexander's son-in-law. It's the same either way. But you—you better think hard. Once I marry into the Sinclair family, I'll naturally earn Dad's favor. Then what place will there be for you in the Prescott Group?"

With that, Nathaniel walked off with a proud smile, striding past Sebastian.

"Nathaniel! Don't get too ahead of yourself!"

Sebastian slammed his cane on the ground in a fit of rage. "Whether or not this marriage happens isn't up to you to decide!"

As Nathaniel left the balcony, a sly grin curled his lips. He knew Sebastian had taken the bait.

"This billion-dollar son-in-law position, I'm practically giving it away."
###Chapter 465

The tension in the air was palpable as the dinner party came to an abrupt end.

Isabella Sinclair had spent the entire evening on pins and needles after learning about her arranged marriage to the heir of the Vanderbilt family. Her usually radiant face had turned ghostly pale, as if all warmth had drained from her body.

On the ride home, she sat beside her mother, deprived of even a moment to speak with Sebastian.

"Mom, why?" Isabella's voice trembled with unshed tears. "You know I love Nathaniel. You know he's the only one I'd ever marry. So why are we suddenly arranging a marriage with the Vanderbilts?"

Eleanor Sinclair's heart ached with silent bitterness, yet her voice remained steady. "Your father and I believe this match is more suitable for you. Nathaniel is a wonderful man, but his family... we simply can't approve. From what I understand, Mr. and Mrs. Lockwood don't think highly of us. If you married him without their blessing, your life would be constant hardship. Look at your sister - strong as she is, she suffered terribly in her marriage to the Blackwoods before they divorced."

She continued, her voice hardening. "Furthermore, Dominic has taken a public stance against our family, even representing Victoria Sterling in court after all we've done for him. I know lawyers shouldn't take sides, but Victoria has hurt your sister repeatedly."

The memory of the humiliation her daughter had endured still pained Eleanor deeply. "Dominic's actions and the Lockwoods' indulgence are unacceptable to your father and me. Our family's reputation isn't what it used to be, and I won't tie us to them."

"But Nathaniel is different!" Isabella's chest constricted, her voice choked with emotion. "Ever since graduation, he's been supporting my brother and sister. How can Dad ignore his loyalty? Dismissing everything Nathaniel has done is so unfair. It'll break his heart!"

The kind-hearted girl was more outraged for her beloved Nathaniel than for her own future. "And Arabella told me her divorce from Mr. Reginald wasn't because of pressure from the Blackwoods, but because he didn't love her. But Nathaniel has never let me down."

Eleanor pressed her lips together, her eyelashes fluttering.

"He's always been so good to me, truly good," Isabella continued, tears streaming down her cheeks as she recalled their happy moments. "Mom, I'll never find another man who treats me like he does. I don't want to lose him. I've loved him since we were children, and now when we can finally be together... Please talk to Dad. Don't let them tear us apart."

"Isabella, you're a Sinclair. Don't you think you should contribute to our family? Or do you plan to remain a sheltered child with no sense of duty?"

Eleanor, usually so gentle and soft-spoken - even when Isabella had secretly applied to film school against her father's wishes - now spoke with unexpected sternness that stunned her daughter.

"Every Sinclair child must contribute unconditionally," Eleanor continued. "Even your sister, who traveled the world freely for years, has returned to help your father with our struggling hotels and will eventually take over Sinclair Holdings. The burden she carries is unimaginable."

Isabella hung her head, her slender fingers twisting together until they turned white.

Arabella wasn't just her sister - she was her idol.

She'd never envied or tried to compete with her brilliant sister, knowing she could never match her talents.

But was this why she had to sacrifice her love?

"Mom..."

"And there's the matter of social standing," Eleanor added, shaking her head. "Nathaniel's family is beneath ours. Your sister is powerful enough, and her future husband will be CEO of Blackwood Enterprises. What good would your marriage to Nathaniel do for her? For our family? You always say you want to contribute - well, now is your time to make that sacrifice."

When Isabella returned to Windsor Estates, her eyes were swollen from crying. She lingered in the car, not wanting anyone to see her in such a state.

William Sinclair's car had arrived first, and he strode into the house with Lawrence Bennett following closely.

"Chairman William."

He paused, noticing Nathaniel standing uncertainly before him.

"Nathaniel, still here at this hour?" the magnate inquired with a faint smile.

"Chairman William." Nathaniel hesitated, his voice hoarse with emotion.

"I know - you're waiting for Isabella, aren't you?"

Nathaniel felt the sting of being seen through, awkward yet helpless. After a moment's silence, he spoke with guilty sincerity. "Chairman William, I'm truly sorry about my brother's actions. But please believe me - no matter what the Lockwoods decide, I'll always stand by you and Miss Isabella. My loyalty is unwavering."

William's lips curled slightly. "This is your family matter. No need to explain to me. I imagine you have much to say to Isabella. Go ahead - I won't intrude."

The words sent an inexplicable chill down Nathaniel's spine.

By the time he collected himself, William had already walked away.

After what felt like an eternity, Isabella emerged, her face pale as porcelain, her gaze distant as she walked through the gates.

"Isabella!"

Nathaniel surged forward, arms wide, pulling his beloved into an embrace so tight it could never be close enough.

"Nathaniel, ease up! I can't breathe," Isabella teased lightly, forcing a smile.

Tears brimmed in his eyes as he ignored her words, tightening his embrace instead, his lips leaving a fiery mark on her shoulder. "I'm so sorry my family has put you in this position."

Isabella took a shaky breath, fighting back tears. "Don't be silly. You're overthinking it."

They held each other for a long while before reluctantly parting.

"Nathaniel, I have a lot of planning to do for the future. I'll be very busy." Isabella's voice was soft, her eyes flickering. "And I've been away at Elmsworth University for four years, rarely home. Now that I have time, I want to stay with my parents. You've just recovered from serious injuries, and I heard my sister wants you to trial in the legal department. You'll be busy too, right?"

Nathaniel's heart clenched. "Isabella, what are you trying to say?"

"Let's stop seeing each other for a while," she said with a smile that tried to be light but carried sadness.

At that moment, Nathaniel felt his heart being torn apart. He gripped her shoulders. "Isabella, is Chairman William pressuring you? Is that why you don't want to see me?"

Her smile grew more strained, but she couldn't tell him the truth, afraid he couldn't handle it.

"No, it's just... after everything that's happened, I think we should wait until my sister and Mr. Reginald resolve your brother's situation, and until my father cools down. Then meeting might be easier. You should go rest - you haven't slept well these past few days. You look exhausted."

Isabella's fingertips trembled as they traced the redness around Nathaniel's eyes, emotions churning painfully in her chest.

Finally unable to contain herself, she rose on her toes, cradling his face as her lips met his in a kiss that conveyed all her love through tears.

"Nathaniel, I love you."

Arabella had just finished showering when she spotted Isabella, eyes swollen and red, hurrying toward her room. "Isabella! Isabella!"

But her sister kept walking, quickening her pace as if she hadn't heard.

Arabella knew better - Isabella was deliberately ignoring her. With a heavy heart, she followed.

"Isabella, what's wrong?" She reached out, grabbing her sister's arm.

Isabella turned slowly, cheeks still wet with tears. "It's nothing, Arabella."

Arabella was taken aback. "You've been crying? Why? Did you fight with Nathaniel? Or—"

"Arabella, you and Mr. Reginald must be happy."

With that cryptic remark, Isabella broke free and ran down the hallway despite Arabella's calls. Frowning, Arabella sensed trouble and dialed Nathaniel's number.

"Miss Arabella," Nathaniel's voice was heavy with sorrow, restless.

"Nathaniel, what did you say to my sister? She's crying so hard. Did you upset her?" Arabella demanded, hands on hips.

"Isabella's crying?" Pain squeezed Nathaniel's heart as he told the truth. "Miss Arabella, we didn't argue, but when she returned earlier, she was already upset. She said we won't see each other for a while. That's all she said."

Arabella grew more suspicious. She knew how inseparable Isabella and Nathaniel were - just this morning, they'd reaffirmed their commitment. Why suddenly stop seeing each other?

"Did Isabella go out alone tonight? What did she do? Did she tell you?"

After a moment's thought, Nathaniel replied quietly, "I believe she went out with Chairman William and Mrs. Eleanor."

Arabella's expression darkened at the news.

In the study, William, having taken his medication, slumped on the sofa, eyes closed, seeking momentary peace.

"Lawrence, bring me the basin. I feel sick."

"Right away! Just hold on!"

Lawrence hurried with the basin, kneeling beside William.

William clutched his chest, face contorted as he retched, but nothing came up.

"Mr. William, the medication is too strong. You should reduce the dosage. I'm worried - what if your health deteriorates further?"

"As you age, breakdown is inevitable whether you take medicine or not. Just accept it." William caught his breath, his forced vigor fading to reveal exhaustion. "Just don't let the children know, especially Arabella. I don't want to break her heart."

Moisture gathered in Lawrence's eyes. "Mr. William, stay positive. With today's medicine, there's hope."

"I know, and of course I'd like to live longer. What would happen to Arabella if I died? And my wives who've stood by me?" William rubbed his temples. "But I must plan ahead. Before Arabella takes over, I need to eliminate potential obstacles."

"Sebastian has never shown interest in the family business - his passions lie elsewhere. Yet everyone knows if his sister were in trouble, he'd abandon his dreams to stand by her."

Meanwhile, outside the study, Arabella paused mid-stride as William and Lawrence's voices filtered through the mahogany door.

She stood completely still.
###Chapter 466

The tension in the study was thick enough to cut with a knife.

Emeric Ashbourne had everything a man could desire—power, wealth, and a legacy that stretched back generations. Yet beneath the polished veneer of success, he carried a loneliness only his longtime confidant, Dn, truly understood.

"Dn, the situation is more complicated than it appears," Emeric murmured, rubbing his temples. "While Evadne was abroad, Cassius managed the consortium, and it drained him. When she returned, he stepped aside without protest, knowing his limits. But Cassius and Arnold…"

His voice trailed off, his expression darkening with unspoken thoughts.

Dn remained silent, his sharp gaze fixed on Emeric, waiting.

"After careful consideration, Evadne is the best successor. Even if I don’t particularly care for Thaddeus, I can’t deny how much she loves him. He’s in a precarious position within the Abernathy Group, constantly under his brother’s shadow. But he’s sharp, decisive—reminds me of myself in my younger days. If he can’t secure his place there, he’d still be a formidable asset to Evadne and our company."

Dn smirked. "Mr. Emeric, you worry too much. Thaddeus isn’t the type to be a trophy husband. The man has too much pride—and a military background. He’d never be comfortable living off his wife’s fortune."

Emeric waved a dismissive hand. "Just speculation. If he succeeds, all the better. If not, he can help Evadne absorb the Abernathy Group. Consider it an engagement gift."

Dn exhaled, shaking his head.

Outside the door, Evadne clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms. Emeric, your ambition knows no bounds.

"But before any of that, I need to stabilize the chaos around us," Emeric continued, his voice hardening. "Jeff saved my life—that debt can’t be ignored. But if this marriage falls through, the Chambers Group will become our enemy."

His head throbbed at the thought. "After the last race, our feud with Fairhaven is set in stone. Frederic has always opposed me, and even with Hamilton’s support, he’s aging. How long can he protect the Abernathy Group? If we move against Elmsworth, we’ll face retaliation from both Abernathy and Fairhaven. And if the Chambers Group turns on us too…"

Dn’s frown deepened.

The Ashbourne family was untouchable in Skyrim, but in Elmsworth, if the other families united against them, it would be like wolves circling prey. Evadne was still inexperienced—how would she handle that?

"Which is why Nydia must marry into the Chambers family."

Evadne’s breath hitched, her ears ringing.

"Avery is capable—less aggressive than Thaddeus, but just as firm. After observing him, I believe he might even surpass Matthew." Emeric’s lips curled. "Who will ultimately control the Chambers Group? That remains to be seen."

"Avery is cunning," Dn admitted. "After fifteen years in exile, he returned and completely changed Jeff’s opinion of him—enough to arrange this marriage. That speaks volumes."

"So Nydia marrying him is a fair exchange. It strengthens our alliance, and when Evadne takes over, having her sister as the wife of the Chambers Group’s CEO will be invaluable."

"But Nydia loves Jason!"

The mention of the Dempsey family made Emeric’s blood boil. "Dave has lost his mind, letting his eldest son run wild. Cedric, with his mediocre talent, dares cozy up to Frederic and provoke Evadne under Abernathy’s protection! And his wife dares look down on Nydia? The Ashbournes’ least is still leagues above them!"

"You’d force Nydia to marry that scheming snake Avery? Have you no shame?"

The door burst open. Evadne stormed in, her face flushed with fury.

Emeric and Dn jolted in their seats.

"Evadne," Emeric snapped, irritation flashing in his eyes. "Have you forgotten how to knock?"

"Knock?" She scoffed. "Since when did Silverlake Harbor require formalities? Or are you just feeling guilty?"

Her hands trembled. "Emeric, who do you think you are—some emperor trading daughters for power? First you play the field, now you’re selling Nydia to the Chambers Group? What kind of father are you? I thought you were just reckless, but you’re heartless!"

Emeric nearly choked.

His voice turned icy. "You don’t understand the weight of leadership. The Ashbourne empire supports thousands. Before I took over, I endured humiliation and sacrifice to build this. Every decision is for stability."

"Stability?" Evadne’s laugh was bitter. "By destroying Nydia’s happiness? Who’s next? Debby escaped early—are you regretting not having more daughters to auction off?"

"Evadne!"

He stood abruptly, towering over her.

The air between them crackled with tension.

Dn wiped his brow, distressed.

"So what’s your grand plan?" Evadne seethed. "Make enemies of every major family? Do you really think you can withstand their combined force?"

"Don’t underestimate me!"

"Avery is a viper!" she shot back. "He’s sabotaged Debby, Thaddeus, and my brother! While you’re counting his coins, he’s plotting your downfall! And you’re handing Nydia to him?"

Emeric’s eyes narrowed. "Since when did you become such a convincing liar?"

"You think I’m lying?" Her voice cracked. "Emeric, has Avery bewitched you?"

"Miss Evadne," Dn interjected carefully, "do you have proof?"

"I’ll get it," she hissed. "But I need time."

She couldn’t reveal everything—not without risking their plans.

"Then bring me evidence," Emeric said coldly, turning away. "Until then, my decision stands."

Dn followed him, casting a worried glance back at Evadne.

"Emeric!" she shouted after him. "You greedy, heartless bastard! I hate you!"

The words struck like a blade.

Emeric froze, pain flashing across his face.

The last time she’d looked at him like this was after her mother’s death.

He had given her everything—sacrificed for her future.

And all it earned him was her hatred.

"You want to marry Thaddeus, don’t you?" His voice was glacial. "Love blessed by all is rare. Those who oppose will always interfere. My actions secure your happiness, stabilize the family, and give Nydia prestige. Isn’t that worth it?"

Evadne’s shoulders slumped.

For the first time, she saw him clearly—terrifying in his ruthlessness.

Exhausted, she retreated to her room, her mind racing.

She couldn’t let this marriage happen.

Her phone buzzed—Thaddeus.

His voice, warm and teasing, soothed her frayed nerves. "You sound down. Miss me?"

She swallowed the lump in her throat. "Yeah. And you know it."

He chuckled. "Then stop missing me. Come see me."

But as she hung up, guilt twisted inside her.

This was her fault.

Her love for Thaddeus had set this disaster in motion.
###Chapter 467

The phone slipped from Isabella's fingers as she bolted through the long corridor like a bird escaping its cage, her feet carrying her swiftly toward the gates of Silvercrest Harbor.

The night was thick with silence, broken only by a single, flickering streetlamp.

Beneath its golden glow stood a tall, striking figure, his eyes alight with anticipation.

Though the forecast had warned of storms, Alexander hadn't cared. The moment his work at Kingsley Enterprises was done, he'd driven straight here, his heart pounding with the need to see her.

Only a day had passed.

Yet the longing had been unbearable.

"Alexander!"

Isabella burst through the heavy doors, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears as she sprinted toward him.

His usually sharp gaze softened, lips curving into a tender smile.

He had already opened his arms, ready to catch her—but she was already flying into them. His strong embrace tightened around her, pulling her close.

"I drove like a madman to get here," he murmured, his warm breath brushing her ear. "I was terrified you'd already be asleep, that I'd miss seeing you."

His right arm wrapped around her waist, his left hand stroking her back in slow, soothing circles. "But it wouldn't have mattered. I'd have waited all night. Even if the sun rose, I wouldn't have left."

"Alexander..." Isabella's voice trembled, her lashes damp.

Being in his arms was like finding shelter in a storm.

No place in the world felt safer than the circle of his embrace.

"Hmm?" He tilted her chin up, his brow furrowing when he saw the tears. "You're crying? Who hurt you?"

Her fingers twisted into his shirt, crumpling the fabric.

Nathaniel's cruel words echoed in her mind—that her sister's engagement to the Chambers heir was merely a stepping stone for her own relationship with Alexander. A choked sob escaped her.

"Should we break up?"

Alexander's heart clenched. "Isabella," he whispered, voice rough with fear. "What's wrong? Why would you say that?"

"Is it because of me that people keep getting hurt?"

The words spilled out, her usual strength crumbling. With others, she was unshakable. But with him, she was raw, vulnerable. "First my brother, now Seraphina... Alexander, maybe we're not meant to be. Maybe we're just—"

His face paled, hands tightening at her waist. "Isabella, don't scare me like this. Tell me what happened."

She bit her lip, struggling to find the words.

"Isabella," he pressed, voice breaking. "Ask anything of me. If you wanted me to walk away from Kingsley Enterprises, I'd do it without hesitation. Just—don't leave me."

They had fought too hard to be together. The thought of losing her now was unbearable.

But how could she change Nathaniel's mind? How could she stop her sister from being forced into this marriage?

Taking a deep breath, she recounted the night's events—though she left out her confrontation with Nathaniel, not wanting to burden him further.

Alexander held her close, his expression darkening. "Just because we're together, Nathaniel is rushing your sister into marriage with the Chambers heir? Even if he favors them, this seems too sudden."

"It's not sudden," Isabella said bitterly, fingers tightening against his chest. "He's been planning this. He never approved of us, and he's probably been negotiating with Mr. Chambers behind the scenes to push me into marrying Adrian. At the last race, I heard from Sebastian that Nathaniel was getting cozy with Adrian—laying the groundwork. If the Fairhaven scandal hadn't derailed things, Nathaniel might have announced my engagement to Adrian in front of everyone. He's ruthless."

The pain of her grip was sharp, but Alexander didn't mind. "Isabella, don't worry. Even if Nathaniel tried, do you really think I'd stand by and let Adrian take you?"

He caught her hand, pressing a kiss to her knuckles, his gaze burning. "I'd tear the world apart to keep you."

You wouldn't have to, she thought. I've always been yours.

"But thanks to Evelyn's interference, Nathaniel's opinion of you has softened," she murmured. "Otherwise, he might have thrown both me and Seraphina at the Chambers family just to cut you off completely. I think Mr. Chambers must have pressured him, forcing him to offer Seraphina as a sacrifice. It's disgusting."

Alexander shared her fury. "Isabella, as much as I hate to say it, Adrian's obsession with you runs deep. He might not settle for marrying your sister. If he's determined to have you, an arranged marriage won't stop him. With Byron out of the picture, Nathaniel would never let Seraphina marry him. This engagement might fall apart."

"True," she sighed, leaning into him. "But Adrian is desperate. And desperate men are dangerous. Maybe this is just another one of his schemes—agreeing to the marriage to torment me, to make me feel so guilty I can't be happy with you. If he can't kill me, he'll settle for breaking my heart."

"We'll face it together," he promised.

As if on cue, thunder cracked in the distance, lightning splitting the sky.

Seconds later, rain poured down in sheets.

Alexander quickly opened the car door, and they tumbled into the back seat.

The confined space, humid with the storm, seemed to heighten every sensation. Without a word, they crashed together, lips meeting in a feverish kiss, their passion rivaling the tempest outside.

Breathless, Isabella arched into him, fingers fumbling with his tie.

Alexander's eyes darkened with desire. His hand slid over her shoulder, the silk of her camisole slipping down to reveal skin like polished marble.

"Isabella," he groaned, unable to hold back any longer.

Through the rain-streaked windows, their shadows melded into one.

The car was too small, too restrictive—yet Isabella felt weightless, as if floating among the clouds, her body melting into his.

Later, when the storm had eased, she lay limp in his arms, hair tousled from their passion.

"Next time," she murmured, "maybe book us a room? My back is killing me."

Alexander chuckled, mischief in his voice. "You think a bed would save your back?"

She swatted his chest, cheeks flushing.

"Isabella," he said suddenly, serious. "At the gala this weekend—every elite family in New York will be there. I want to announce our relationship to everyone. Is that okay with you?"

Her eyes widened, breath catching.

Misreading her silence, he squeezed her hand. "Truthfully, I'd rather propose. But I don't want to rush you."

"Why that night?" she finally managed.

"Because I can't wait any longer," he admitted, voice rough. "I need the world to know I belong to you."

Sebastian returned to the Prescott estate, exhausted. From Isabella, he'd learned Seraphina had been crying, had tried calling him countless times—but she'd ignored him, eventually shutting off her phone.

He didn't understand. They'd been inseparable all day. Why was she shutting him out now?

What the hell had happened? His head throbbed with frustration.

"Well, brother, how was your date with the Ashbourne heiress?" Preston's mocking voice cut through the air, making Sebastian's fists clench.

"Seems it didn't go well," Preston taunted, smirking. "What's wrong? Did your golden ticket slip away?"

"I see the Abernathy family's lapdog is still barking," Sebastian shot back coldly.

"At least I earn my keep honestly," Preston sneered. "Unlike you, clinging to a woman's skirts to climb the ladder. When the Ashbourne heiress didn't work out, you settled for Seraphina. Pathetic."

Sebastian's patience snapped. His fist flew—but just in time, Margaret Prescott appeared.

"Sebastian! Stop this at once!"

But he was beyond listening.

"Mom, Seraphina is the woman I love," he snarled, eyes blazing. "Don't insult her."

Margaret recoiled. Her dutiful son had never spoken to her like this.

"I want to marry her," he declared. "No one else."

"And what about your family?" Margaret's voice cracked. "What about me?"

"If you want to keep me as your son, don't speak ill of her. And don't try to stop me—because you can't."

With that, he turned on his heel and stormed upstairs.

"Sebastian!" Margaret shrieked after him. "I'll never allow that woman's daughter into this house! Not unless I'm dead!"

Sebastian paused.

For a second, she thought he'd reconsider.

But he only said, coldly, "Preston, back off. Don't try to clear Elspeth's name. Or I might do something even I can't predict."

"Are you threatening me?" Preston spat.

Sebastian smirked. "You're right about one thing—I am a dog. But not like you. I'm the kind that bites."

Then he was gone, leaving Preston trembling in the cold.

Ever since talk of the arranged marriage began, Byron had dreamed of Seraphina two nights in a row.

She was undeniably beautiful—though just Myra's daughter, nowhere near Isabella's status.

But that wasn't the point.

The point was, he—once the golden boy—had fallen from grace. He needed the Ashbourne family's backing. And he wasn't about to let Adrian steal it from him.

That evening, he summoned Margaret to the wine cellar.

As kids, they'd loved playing here. Now, it was their sanctuary for private talks.

"Byron, you're seriously considering marrying Myra's daughter?" Margaret frowned. "Seems beneath you."

Always closer to her second brother than their imposing eldest, she hated seeing him settle. "You were Father's favorite. And Myra? She's nothing—just Nathaniel's mistress. Her daughter has no real standing. Sure, she's called an Ashbourne heiress, but let's be honest—she's a bastard. Nathaniel's wife has five children—four sons and Isabella. And with his second wife, Sun, having a son and daughter too, Myra and Seraphina will never inherit. What do you gain from this?"

"The Ashbournes aren't like other families. Nathaniel cares for all his children," Byron muttered, downing his wine. "And in my state, do I have a choice?"

Margaret sighed. "So what's your plan? You wouldn't call me here unless you needed help."

Byron leaned in, eyes dark. "You high-society ladies always find reasons to visit Elvira's salons. Surely you can get me close to Seraphina before Adrian does?"
###Chapter 468

Margaret's eyes gleamed with sudden realization.

Elvira was a household name among Elmsworth's elite, her psychic reputation drawing wealthy clients from across the country.

But behind her mystical facade, Elvira's hands were stained with shady dealings. For the right price, she'd arrange marriages between powerful families without hesitation.

"I understand completely. Father's always been superstitious, constantly consulting mediums," Margaret said smoothly. "I'll introduce Elvira to him. He'll be eager to meet her."

Her mind raced with schemes. "Then I'll pay Elvira to spin a tale about you and the Ashbourne heiress being destined soulmates. That marrying her would bring prosperity to Chambers Group."

"And if the Ashbourne girl ends up with our youngest brother instead," she continued, "it would mean disaster for the family. Father's superstitious enough to believe it. He'll move heaven and earth to make sure you marry into the Ashbourne estate."

"Perfect! Thank you, Margaret," Byron said, gripping his sister's hand gratefully.

"Byron, we've been through everything together since childhood," Margaret said earnestly. "With Mother gone and Father remarried to that cheating woman, plus our half-brother eyeing our inheritance - we must stick together. Who else would I support?"

As a married woman with a husband embroiled in political battles, Margaret barely kept up appearances. She often dipped into her own funds to support his shadowy maneuvers while maintaining her high society image.

If Avery's influence grew, she'd lose all standing in Chambers Group.

When inheritance time came, her brothers would take care of her. The youngest? He'd be lucky not to bury her alive. That's why she was determined to help Byron succeed.

"But remember, we're not in medieval times anymore. Parents can't dictate everything."

Byron rolled a cigar between his fingers, his expression troubled. "I've heard Nydia and Evadne's secretary are close, and Evadne supports them. You know Evadne's influence - she's Emeric's favorite and has Thaddeus's backing. If she opposes us, getting Nydia to the altar might be difficult."

A sly smile crossed Margaret's face as a dark idea formed. "The solution is simple, Byron. We need to play rough."

"What do you mean?"

"Force a binding commitment," she said with sinister undertones.

Byron was stunned.

Though no stranger to conquests, Nydia was Ashbourne's precious flower - not to be trifled with lightly.

"Even with Elvira's help, it's not guaranteed. Chairman Emeric might still refuse. So instead of waiting, why not secure the girl first? Force Emeric's hand to marry her to you, leaving Evadne no room to interfere. Even if you can't win her heart, claim her first."

Byron nodded fiercely. "You're right."

With their plan set, the siblings clinked glasses and opened champagne.

Unbeknownst to them, a small listening device under the table blinked ominously.

At The Velvet Haven, Avery lounged elegantly on a vintage sofa, swirling red wine as he listened to the siblings' plot. The more he heard, the more amused he became.

"My dear siblings are quite the comedic duo," he mused. "Mere jesters."

"Aren't you angry, sir? They're plotting against you," Harvey asked, bewildered.

"Why be angry? They're playing right into my hands." Avery peered into his wine with a chilling smile. "I'll even help my dear brother. Consider it my wedding gift to him and Ms. Nydia."

Thanks to Margaret's machinations, Jeff had a successful meeting with Elvira, who fed him exactly the story Margaret had scripted.

Deep down, Jeff wanted nothing more than for Byron to marry into the Ashbourne family. Despite Avery's efforts to please him, fifteen years of absence meant Byron remained his favorite.

But Emeric was proud. Even if Nydia wasn't his beloved wife's daughter, how could he marry such a radiant young woman to his disabled son?

Time passed, and soon the anticipated weekend arrived. News of J Group's William and his son hosting a top-tier business dinner spread rapidly through Elmsworth's elite circles.

That evening, an exotic castle resort outside Elmsworth was fully booked for the event. Luxury cars lined up outside while inside, security ensured complete privacy from the swarming media.

One by one, scions from the four major families arrived discreetly. Even the usually ostentatious Fairhavens kept a low profile, still smarting from the recent racing club scandal.

"Grandpa, do you really think Mr. Frederic will announce my engagement to Thad tonight?" Edith purred from Barry's arms. "Can he actually convince Thad? He's so stubborn."

"Convince him? Does he have a choice?" Barry scoffed. "Unless he wants to lose his position at Abernathy Group. I've settled everything with Mr. Frederic. With the wedding gift I've arranged, he has no reason to refuse!"

"But what if Chairman Hamilton objects?"

"How long can that old man pull strings? The Abernathy Group is Mr. Frederic's show now." Barry sneered. "Frederic made it clear - he won't allow someone like Evadne, who manipulates his son and causes trouble, into the family. That Ashbourne girl has outsmarted herself. Don't worry, Edith. She won't block your path any longer."

Edith's face lit up with excitement. She had planned to humiliate Evadne tonight, but if Barry had already secured the engagement, she could afford to be merciful.

Inside the banquet hall, enchanting music filled the air as high society glittered.

Thaddeus arrived not with his family but alongside Jareth, avoiding any appearance of partiality. Their entrance captured everyone's attention.

With no woman on Thaddeus's arm, the ladies present knew better than to covet - who could compete with the Ashbourne heiress?

But their gazes toward Jareth were different - full of desperate longing. Since his relationship with Mari had only been acknowledged once publicly, Jareth remained Elmsworth's most eligible bachelor.

To Jareth, these women held no appeal compared to Thaddeus's company.

"Why leave Mari at home?" Thaddeus asked coolly.

Jareth rolled his eyes. "Do I need to be castrated before you trust me?"

"Time will tell."

"Damn it, the moment these women heard I needed a date, they swarmed like vultures. If they weren't women, I'd have knocked them out!"

Jareth huffed, missing his wife. "Mari hates these events. Honestly, I didn't want to come either, but duty calls. I've taken my uncle's place helping Grandpa manage Fairhaven Group."

Thaddeus's lips curved slightly. "A toast to your ascent."

"Congratulate me when it's official."

"You're Barry's only grandson. It's inevitable he'd groom you." Thaddeus clapped his shoulder. "I'm happy for you, Jareth. Now that you're moving up, clean up those gray-area businesses. At least keep your public image clean. And I don't want Mari worrying about you. Straighten up, understand?"

Jareth's throat tightened. "Damn it, you're going to make me cry."

Truthfully, he'd been thinking the same - determined to build a secure future for Mari.

"The K Group has arrived!"

The announcement made Thaddeus stiffen. His calm heartbeat suddenly pounded as he straightened his bow tie, gazing toward the entrance with unwavering affection.

Jareth snickered. Anyone would think Thaddeus was awaiting his bride.

Moments later, Emeric and Cassius entered gracefully, followed by two stunning women - Evadne and Nydia.

One a breathtaking red rose, the other a pure white rose - the sisterly duo captured all attention, making other women present seem garish by comparison.

"No doubt the belle of the ball is still Ashbourne's eldest," someone murmured.

"The one beside her must be Chairman Emeric's adopted daughter. She holds her own next to Evadne."

"Marry one and your ancestors would rejoice. Both? Keep dreaming."

The men's imaginations ran wild.

Thaddeus's eyes darkened, fists clenching.

"Easy, brother," Jareth nudged him.

"You'd be just as forgiving if it were Mari."

Jareth had no retort.

Thaddeus took a deep breath.

As if sensing him, Evadne turned and gave him an endearing wink.

Thaddeus swallowed hard.

Just then, two figures approached.

"Chairman Emeric, what a pleasure," one said, with meaningful glances toward Evadne. "And your lovely daughters."
###Chapter 469

Emeric narrowed his piercing gaze, exuding an air of effortless authority as he clasped hands with William.

In every way, he matched the man’s stature.

"Regarding the incident at the racetrack, I hope my daughter hasn’t caused you any offense, Mr. Morris. She’s spirited, lacking worldly experience. If she overstepped, I trust you’ll overlook it." Emeric’s smile was polished, his voice rich with aristocratic refinement.

The crowd froze.

Had they heard correctly?

The heir to a centuries-old dynasty, the head of a financial empire, was extending courtesy to Emeric? The Ashbournes were wealthy, yes, but their influence was confined to Skyrim.

The Abernathy and Chambers Groups, however, were Elmsworth’s elite. Why would William bypass them for Emeric?

Frederic, Barry, and Jeff approached, expressions unreadable.

Frederic’s jaw tightened.

In Elmsworth’s circles, it was common knowledge that the J Group’s first domestic venture had gone to Abernathy. Yet here was William, indifferent to Frederic, favoring Emeric—a man with no prior business ties.

A silent power play.

"Chairman Emeric, you’re too humble."

William lavished praise on Evadne. "Your daughter is exceptional—stunning, with equestrian skills rivaling professionals. After the race, Ford couldn’t stop admiring her. They share a passion for horses; I’m certain they’d have much to discuss."

He gestured to his son, who adjusted his tie and strode forward.

Ford smirked at Thaddeus, a taunt in his gaze.

Thaddeus’s fists clenched, fury simmering beneath his skin.

"Damn it, Thad, that blond bastard’s provoking you!" Jareth growled. "We’re in Elmsworth, not his turf. Who does he think he is?"

"He wants Evadne," Thaddeus muttered, jealousy bitter on his tongue.

"My sister-in-law’s too dazzling. Any man who isn’t smitten should question his sanity." Jareth pitied Thaddeus—loving a woman like Evadne was a battlefield.

"Ms. Evadne, a pleasure to see you again." Ford extended his hand, gaze burning.

Thaddeus’s vision tinted red.

A polite gesture, but the intent was clear.

Jareth yanked him back. "Don’t. He’s just shaking hands. Losing your cool makes you look insecure—like you don’t trust her."

"I won’t let him touch her."

"And ruin Emeric’s business prospects? Evadne mentioned he holds grudges. Screw this up, and you’ll never join that family."

Evadne smiled coolly. "Mr. Ford, to honor your culture, allow me to greet you properly."

She curtsied, graceful as a queen, her red gown sweeping the floor. The men around her sighed in admiration—Ford most of all.

Only she knew the truth: she’d never let his hands near her.

Ford was worse than Jareth—a notorious playboy with a trail of illegitimate children.

Disgusting.

Thaddeus caught her ruse, lips curving in a private smile.

Ford, oblivious, preened under her "admiration."

"This gathering," William announced, "isn’t just for business. My son wishes to know Ms. Evadne better."

The implication was obvious: he wanted her as his daughter-in-law.

Cassius’s gaze darkened, flicking to his father.

Then Emeric dropped the bomb. "Mr. William, are you proposing to my daughter?"

Gasps erupted.

Evadne stiffened. Her father had no filter.

Thaddeus’s palms dampened. He trusted Evadne—but not Emeric.

If Emeric had bartered Nydia to Avery for business, what stopped him from accepting the Morrises’ offer?

Especially since he’d never approved of Thaddeus.

Ford, unable to contain himself, blurted, "Yes, Chairman Emeric. It was love at first sight."

The crowd buzzed with envy.

Evadne, a divorcee, was now the most sought-after woman in the room.

"Ms. Evadne’s elegance at the races captivated me. I’ve eyes for no one else. I humbly ask for the chance to court her." Ford’s words were humble, his demeanor anything but.

"Evadne—" Nydia gripped her hand.

Unfazed, Evadne arched a brow. "Mr. Ford, I’m divorced. Surely you’re aware?"

William and Ford faltered.

All eyes darted to Thaddeus, his expression stormy.

"That Ashbourne girl has no shame," Barry sneered to Frederic. "Flouting her disgrace publicly—she’s mocking the Abernathy name."

Frederic’s face darkened.

"For others, divorce is a stain. For Ms. Evadne? A badge of honor," Edith drawled. "She’s reveling in this—humiliating Thaddeus, proving her allure."

Frederic’s mood blackened.

"You flatter me, Mr. Ford," Evadne said smoothly. "But I’m unworthy of your standards. Surely you can aim higher."

A rejection, wrapped in grace.

Ford’s pride stung. He might’ve hesitated over her past, but her dismissing him? Unthinkable.

"Ms. Evadne, your past means nothing. You’re radiant—a star among dull stones. Your ex was a fool. I’d cherish you. Please, give me this opportunity!"

"I swear, I’m going to be sick," Jareth muttered.

"This is my fault," Thaddeus said hoarsely. "If I’d been better to her—"

The crowd gaped. Even William was stunned—his proud son, begging for a woman’s favor.

As Evadne prepared to eviscerate Ford, Emeric draped an arm around her shoulders.

"Gentlemen, my daughter is already engaged."

Silence.

Engaged?
###Chapter 470

Isabella's pulse stuttered as her gaze locked onto Alexander's striking profile.

Nathan's eyes burned with barely restrained tension, his body coiled like a spring ready to snap. Every instinct screamed at him to stride forward, seize Isabella's wrist, and pull her away from this suffocating crowd.

Others—like Harrison and the Fairhaven executives—had gone pale.

Especially Victoria, whose heart pounded violently against her ribs. She glared at Isabella with thinly veiled spite, her voice dripping with mock sweetness. "Well, well. Miss Isabella has a fiancé? Do enlighten us—who is the fortunate gentleman bound to the Sinclair fortune?"

Harrison's jaw clenched. "Whoever it is, rest assured, it won't be anyone from the Vanderbilt Group."

Victoria's lips curled in satisfaction, her anxiety easing.

Dominic's expression darkened. He suspected Alexander was spinning a tale to shield his daughter—nothing more than a convenient excuse to reject his advances.

At the derby, he'd noticed the closeness between Isabella and Nathan. But such flirtations were common among the elite—fleeting distractions, nothing serious. If there had been a fiancé, Alexander would have announced it then, not waited until now to drop the bombshell.

William, however, remained unruffled. "So the young lady is already promised? My congratulations. Might we know which esteemed family the gentleman belongs to?"

Curiosity rippled through the room.

Alexander's smile was effortless as his gaze flickered briefly toward Nathan.

Dominic followed his line of sight and scowled.

"Oh my god—Nathan! Am I hallucinating? Is Chairman Alexander looking at you?" Julian gasped, shaking Nathan's arm like an overexcited puppy.

Nathan's breathing was uneven, his forehead damp with sweat. But his voice remained steady. "Don't read into it. Chairman Alexander is likely just using this as a shield against Dominic."

"Then why look this way? He could've lied without involving us!" Julian insisted, ever the optimist. "It's just us here, and he's definitely looking at you. Unless—" He gasped dramatically. "—he's checking me out?"

Nathan's chest tightened, his control slipping.

His burning gaze remained fixed on Isabella.

"The Sinclair family has always valued discretion," Alexander continued smoothly, his eyes leaving Nathan. "My daughter prefers to keep her private life just that—private. Mr. William, tonight is a business affair, and we wouldn't want personal matters to overshadow it. When the time is right, we will make the announcement. And when we do, I hope you'll join us in Skycrest."

"Skycrest? I've heard the beaches are breathtaking. I wouldn't miss it," William replied smoothly, playing his part flawlessly.

Isabella exhaled silently, grateful for her father's deflection. Lately, he'd been unpredictable—sometimes unrecognizable, other times eerily precise, as if two different men occupied the same body.

The crowd buzzed with speculation.

"Who is her fiancé? Mr. Adrian was close to Chairman Alexander, and Mr. Jeffrey was practically his brother. Maybe it's Mr. Adrian?"

"If it were him, wouldn't he be here tonight? My money's on Mr. Nathan. Did you see them at the derby? Who else would've stayed by her side when she was hurt? If Mr. Adrian were her fiancé and didn't show, that'd be heartless!"

Seraphina watched Isabella, her cheeks flushed with emotion, envy glinting in her eyes.

Her father's intentions were clear—Isabella's fiancé could only be Nathan.

How wonderful it must be, to have love and her family's blessing.

Even now, Seraphina bore no resentment.

The Lockwood family's eldest son had betrayed them, aiding their enemies. Their status was useless now.

Lost in thought, Seraphina's eyes reddened as she swallowed back tears.

She was the least capable in the family. If her arranged marriage could help their cause—

She was ready to sacrifice everything.

As the tension eased, the dinner resumed.

William and Dominic's failed alliance with the Sinclairs emboldened the Vanderbilt Group and Fairhaven executives, even stirring Harrison into action.

Dominic, rejected by Isabella, wore an expression like he'd swallowed something foul. Though William remained composed, his son's humiliation surely festered beneath the surface.

It seemed the Sinclairs were no longer contenders for the derby hotel partnership.

The music shifted, signaling the start of the ball.

Young nobles and debutantes paired off, swirling across the dance floor in a dazzling display.

Isabella noticed Seraphina's nervousness—this was her first high-society event. To ease her sister's anxiety, they slipped away to a quieter corner, sipping fruit punch and chatting.

Seraphina had drawn many admiring glances, but none dared approach with Isabella beside her.

Seraphina kept her turmoil hidden, speaking only when necessary, her voice barely audible.

Isabella squeezed her sister's cold hand. "Seraphina, I won't let you throw yourself into a loveless marriage. Trust me—I'll make sure you're with the one you love."

"Isa, I'm fine," Seraphina whispered, forcing a fragile smile. "An arranged marriage... I won't resist. If it helps our family, I'll do it. Just focus on your happiness with Nathan. Don't worry about me."

"What?" Isabella's voice cracked. "How could I sacrifice your happiness for mine? If you can't be with Adrian, I'd rather stay single forever! What kind of sister would that make me?"

"Isa, don't be stubborn. It's my choice—"

Before she could finish, a heavily accented voice interrupted.

"Miss Isabella, may I have this dance?"

The sisters looked up to find Dominic bowing before Isabella, his hand extended.

Isabella's expression soured, but before she could refuse, Dominic cut in. "Miss Isabella, if you won't give me a chance to court you, at least grant me one dance. It's merely a social courtesy—nothing more. Surely you won't deny me this small pleasure?"

All eyes turned to them.

Seraphina frowned. Isabella clearly despised the blond suitor, but outright refusal would seem arrogant.

Trapped, Isabella reluctantly raised her hand—

Then, like a winter gale, a commanding figure swept in.

Before Dominic could react, the delicate hand he sought was snatched away.

Isabella gasped as she was spun onto the dance floor, the spotlight searing into her.

Her eyes locked with Nathan's dark, smoldering gaze. Her body trembled in his embrace, heat flooding her skin.

His breath warmed her face as he leaned in, their fingers entwined, his other arm wrapping possessively around her waist. His palm pressed firmly against the small of her back, searing through the thin fabric of her dress.

Isabella struggled to maintain composure, but her body thrummed with electricity, her breaths shallow. She stumbled slightly, trying to match his rhythm.

"What are you doing?" she hissed.

"Would you rather dance with that vulture?" Nathan murmured, his voice low and rough.

Isabella bit her lip, cheeks flushing. "Isn't this just trading one predator for another?"

"Yes," he admitted, spinning her effortlessly. "But I'm the kind of predator who might just devour you." His jaw lifted arrogantly. "Focus, Isabella. Your eyes should only be on me."

They became the envy of the room, their chemistry undeniable.

Every woman present—except Victoria—conceded they were perfectly matched.

Victoria seethed, her nails digging into her palms, powerless to intervene.

Meanwhile, Dominic, humiliated, stormed off in a huff.

William's butler approached discreetly. "Sir, if you'd like a dance partner, perhaps Miss Fairhaven? She's of suitable standing and, while not as radiant as Miss Isabella, won't tarnish your reputation."

"Her? Dressed like a peacock? I'd rather sit this out," Dominic snapped, storming away.

Isabella's abrupt departure left Seraphina alone.

The men, sensing opportunity, edged closer—but a limping figure reached her first.

"Isn't that Byron?" someone murmured.

"I heard he survived a horrific accident. The Chambers hired Dr. Evelyn to treat him. Pity—he's crippled now."

"Byron used to be so proud. This must be devastating."

Byron had spent the past week in grueling physical therapy, dressed impeccably tonight in hopes of impressing Seraphina.

Standing before her now, he realized he could no longer dance.

With a rueful smile, he said, "Miss Seraphina, you seem lonely here. May I keep you company?"

Seraphina tensed—then her phone buzzed.

She glanced down.

Adrian.

Her heart clenched.
###Chapter 471

The moment Isabella Sinclair requested space, Alexander Kingsley had become a man possessed.

His phone calls were relentless, his desperation palpable. Night after night, he stood guard outside her penthouse at Windsor Estates, each visit leaving him more hollow than the last.

The lovesick fool looked no better than when Nathaniel Prescott had chased after Evelyn Prescott with reckless abandon.

Isabella refused to step outside, locking herself away, skipping meals, wasting away to shadows. Her pillows were stained with silent tears.

When the ache for Alexander grew unbearable, she’d creep to the hallway window, parting the curtains just enough to steal a glance.

And every time, he was there.

A solitary figure braced against the wind, his piercing gaze fixed on her window like a beacon in the dark.

Even the thought of him sent knives twisting through her chest, carving wounds that never healed.

She had failed him. The guilt was suffocating. But how could she have both?

In the end, she was selfish too.

Torn between Alexander and her family, she chose the latter.

Isabella stared blankly at her phone when Harrison Blake leaned in, curiosity piqued.

His expression darkened at the screen, but he forced a dry chuckle, retreating instead of pressing. "Ms. Isabella, if you have urgent matters, I’ll leave you to them."

"No. It’s nothing." She steeled herself and ended the call.

Fearing another ring, she powered off her phone entirely.

Enough was enough.

Better to sever it cleanly now than let hope fester, only to crush it later. A clean break was kinder than slow decay.

Harrison’s eyes gleamed as he stammered, "Then... may I sit here?"

Isabella gave a slight nod, shifting to keep distance between them.

Harrison lurched forward, his uneven gait betraying him as he stumbled—

"Careful!" Her instincts kicked in before she could think.

She would’ve helped a stranger cross the street. How could she ignore a man about to fall at her feet?

Harrison seized the moment, gripping her arm, his pulse racing at the contact.

"Thank you, Ms. Isabella," he breathed, gratitude dripping from every word.

Nearby, Richard Langley and Sebastian Wright were deep in conversation.

"Richard, look over there." Sebastian nudged him, nodding toward Isabella and Harrison.

Richard’s brow furrowed slightly at the sight of them chatting.

"Seems your little protégée is getting cozy with Harrison."

Sebastian, ever the opportunist, smirked. "Nathaniel was obsessed with Evelyn—everyone knew it. With our families merging now, if Isabella married Nathaniel, it’d be awkward for everyone. Harrison’s mentioned his interest in her more than once. He rarely admits to liking anyone, but with her? He’s serious. Forced matches never end well, Richard. Maybe we should consider someone... more suitable."

He tried to plead his case, but Richard’s disinterest was palpable. Sebastian sighed in frustration.

Before his injury, Harrison had been a silver-tongued charmer. Now, he scraped together every ounce of wit to entertain Isabella.

Yet she remained unmoved, his jokes falling flat against her walls.

To Harrison, she was just the daughter of a mistress. If not for his disability, why would he settle for her?

What gave her the right to act so superior?

Margaret Laurent watched their stilted exchange, frustration simmering.

Time to play dirty.

Harrison’s secretary rushed over but was intercepted by Margaret’s sharp call. "Where’s the fire? Can’t you see my brother’s busy?"

"Miss Margaret, there’s... a situation." The secretary hesitated.

"Spit it out. Don’t treat me like an outsider."

"It’s the former secretary of the Vanderbilt heiress. He’s outside, waiting."

A sly glint flashed in Margaret’s eyes. "Daniel?"

"Yes! Isn’t he Mr. Nathaniel’s rival? His timing seems deliberate—meant to disrupt Mr. Nathaniel’s plans. I thought I should warn him. Right now, that man can’t enter without an invitation, but if Ms. Evelyn finds out..."

The secretary didn’t need to finish.

"Good thinking. I’ll handle this. Don’t disturb my brother yet." Margaret’s lips curled.

"Of course, Miss Margaret."

Once alone, Margaret’s fingers flew over her phone:

[Harrison, your rival’s at the door. I’m shooing him away. How will you thank me?]

[Dear sister, isn’t that ruby necklace you’ve been eyeing yours already?]

[You’re the best!]

[But since he came all this way, the Laurent family’s hospitality demands we... send him off properly.]

Margaret smirked, fingers curling into a cruel "okay."

The mansion blazed with light, a stark contrast to the biting cold outside.

Daniel Carter’s fingers trembled as the call disconnected. The festive glow around him felt like a thousand needles piercing his chest.

Without an invitation, he was left in the cold—a ghost at the gates.

He could’ve called Evelyn, begged for entry. But pride choked the words in his throat.

Daniel’s head bowed, Adam’s apple bobbing as he swallowed bitter shame.

Was he truly so out of his league?

The woman he loved was inside, and his heart screamed for her.

Yet the divide between them was a fortress, denying him even a glimpse.

"Well, well. Look who’s here."

A razor-sharp voice sliced through the air. Daniel’s head snapped up.

Margaret descended the steps, arms crossed, flanked by bodyguards. She looked down at him like he was dirt.

"Thought I recognized someone. Isn’t this Ms. Evelyn’s little errand boy? My future sister-in-law’s ex?"

Daniel’s fists clenched. "What did you say?"

"Oh, you really don’t know?" Margaret tsked, snatching her secretary’s phone. "Show him. Maybe it’ll knock some sense into him."

The screen flashed—a photo of Isabella supporting Harrison, their bodies close, intimate.

The world shattered.

"No. That’s not possible."

"Oh, but it is." Margaret’s grin was venomous. "The Laurents and Mr. Richard’s family have united. Isabella is to be Harrison’s bride. See how happy they are? Love needs family blessing, or it’s just mutual torture."

"You’re lying!" Daniel’s entire body shook, panic bleeding into his voice.

"Don’t believe me? Ask her yourself." Margaret’s eyes gleamed. "Oh, but she doesn’t want to see you. If she did, would you be out here freezing while she’s warm inside?"

Each word was a bullet to his chest.

"I don’t believe you! Isabella would never—"

He lunged for the gates, mind blank with desperation.

No questions. No doubts.

He refused to believe the woman who loved him would agree to this. He had to take her away!

"Stop him." Margaret’s command was ice.

The bodyguards moved as one.

Daniel fought like a man possessed, his training evident in every strike. Normally, he’d overpower them easily—but his injuries slowed him.

A baton slammed into his wounded shoulder. Pain exploded, sweat drenching his suit.

A kick to his gut sent him staggering, but he stood firm, teeth gritted.

Margaret sneered. "Who do you think you are? The Kingsleys are nothing—just Vanderbilt’s former lapdogs. You really thought you could compete with my brother? Why would a woman like her settle for scraps? Wake up. Crawl back to Evelyn where you belong."

Daniel’s fury burned, but his body betrayed him—his arm barely lifted.

The bodyguards stood unmoved.

Humming, Margaret turned, whispering to her secretary:

"He’s hurt. Finish him."
###Chapter 472

The dim corridor was bathed in silver moonlight, casting long shadows against the walls. Two figures stood entwined in a heated embrace, their breaths mingling in the quiet space.

"Ouch. That hurts. Seriously, it hurts."

"Sorry, Isabella. I'll be more careful."

Isabella Sinclair leaned against the cold wall, her porcelain skin glistening with a faint sheen of sweat. Her long lashes fluttered like delicate wings, and her lips—lightly bitten—only enhanced her ethereal beauty.

Kneeling before her, Alexander Kingsley carefully removed her crimson stilettos, his large hands cradling her slender ankle while the other gently massaged her sore toes.

"You're such a menace, dancing like that. You made me twist my ankle. Don't you know how to treat me gently?" Isabella pouted, her voice laced with playful accusation.

"Blame me all you want, darling. Take it out on me when we get home—however you like. Or start now if you prefer."

Alexander looked genuinely remorseful. At a loss, he tapped his chest. "Go on, hit me right here."

Isabella raised her fist, then let it drop with a sigh. "Forget it. Your chest is like a brick wall. I'd only hurt my hand."

Alexander glanced up, his lips curving into a knowing smirk. He knew she could never bring herself to hurt him.

His skilled fingers worked their magic, easing the pain in Isabella's ankle until only a soothing warmth remained.

As he studied her delicate feet, his Adam's apple bobbed visibly.

She was like a celestial being—her skin flawless, her toes perfectly shaped. He couldn't help but adore them.

"Isabella, your feet are exquisite."

"Wow, you're such a weirdo. Who obsesses over a woman's feet like you do?"

Her cheeks flushed, and her toes curled instinctively in his palm. "Just admit it, Alexander—you're a total rogue!"

"Oh? Is that so?" His voice dropped to a husky murmur. "Do nice guys really finish last? Still sore?"

"My personal masseur has quite the touch," she teased, her lips quirking into a sly smile. "Consider yourself forgiven."

After slipping her heels back on, Alexander rose, bracing one arm against the wall beside her head while the other circled her waist possessively. Without hesitation, he captured her lips in a searing kiss.

He had been holding back for too long, his restraint burning away with each passing second.

Isabella's lashes fluttered shut as she melted into him, her arms winding around his neck, matching his passion with equal fervor.

Their kiss deepened, tongues tangling in a desperate dance, each touch igniting a fire neither could extinguish.

When she finally pulled away, breathless, Alexander wasn't satisfied. He caught her chin, reclaiming her lips with a growl.

"Maybe we shouldn't go public tonight."

Alexander stilled, his expression tightening. "Isabella, what's wrong?"

"Don't overthink it. I just feel that for tonight's occasion, there's no need to make our relationship the center of attention."

She pressed her lips together, then reached up to straighten his tie. "When Nathan made advances earlier, and Emeric shut him down by announcing I was engaged—that was already a blow to them. And I know he was watching you. When he said 'fiancé,' he meant you."

Alexander's pulse spiked at her words.

"So, there's no rush. Everyone knows I'm yours. As long as we understand each other, that's all that matters."

Rising onto her toes, she brushed a featherlight kiss against his lips. "I don't care about words—only actions. We just need to live our lives well. I'm not one for grand displays."

Alexander's voice roughened with emotion. "Isabella, what are you planning?"

"Nothing."

"Are you worried that going public might upset William and his son, affecting your father's deal with the J Corporation?"

This woman was utterly fixated on business—her mind was a steel trap of strategy.

Isabella's gaze flickered. "Only a fool would pass up a profitable opportunity. The racetrack hotel is the first of its kind in the country—a goldmine. If the Sinclair family secures this project, it'll solidify our foothold in Elmsworth. By then, K Corporation can swallow the Chambers Group's market share, weakening them until they can't fight back."

Her jaw clenched as she calculated ruthlessly. "Once that happens, the Chambers Group won't even compare to your Abernathy Group. And I will trample them into the ground."

Alexander understood her intent. Pulling her into a tight embrace, he murmured, "I know you're doing this for your sister. Everything is to stop her marriage to the Chambers family."

His insight struck a chord. She buried her face against his chest, her voice muffled. "I hate that I'm not strong enough. This is the only way I can think of. Do you think I'm ridiculous?"

His heart ached. "No. I think you're brilliant. And right now, this is the best approach. William won't hold a grudge over something so trivial—he's a businessman. He'll choose K Corporation. And even if you don't partner with J Corporation, don't worry. With me by your side, the Chambers Group won't have it easy."

Isabella's eyes shimmered with emotion.

She had always been fiercely independent, solving problems alone, never wanting to burden her family.

Alexander was the first person she wanted to rely on—for the rest of her life.

Suddenly, a noise shattered the moment.

"Someone's there!"

Both their expressions darkened instantly as they turned toward the sound.

A shadowy figure darted away.

"Alexander, we have to catch that eavesdropper!"

Isabella's gaze turned icy. "Our conversation involved business secrets. If the Chambers family hears, we're in trouble."

Alexander nodded sharply. Moving like lightning, he chased after the fleeing figure.

Thanks to his sharp reflexes, it didn't take long to corner the intruder.

"Stop. Don't make me get rough."

The figure stood hunched, breathing heavily—clearly in poor condition.

Alexander frowned. The silhouette was eerily familiar.

"Who are you?"

"Mr. Kingsley."

The man turned slowly.

Moonlight revealed his battered face—bruised, bloodied, his left eye swollen shut.

Alexander's pupils constricted in shock.

"Jason?"

Isabella arrived just in time.

Her stomach lurched at the sight of Jason—his suit torn, his handsome face marred by injuries, his left eye a gruesome mess.

"Jason!"

She rushed to him, her hands trembling as she gripped his shoulders. "What happened? Who did this to you?"

Jason turned his face away, ashamed.

"Talk to me!" Her voice cracked with urgency as she shook him.

"Isabella, calm down!" Alexander wrapped his arms around her waist, pulling her back. "You'll hurt him more!"

Her chest heaved with rage, her breaths coming in sharp gasps.

"Jason, at this point, speak," Alexander demanded firmly. "Do you think hiding this helps her? She's suffering because of it!"

"Please," Jason choked out, tears streaming down his cheeks. "Don't let Nydia marry Byron. I'll do anything."

Isabella's blood ran cold. "The Chambers Group did this to you, didn't they?"

Alexander's fists clenched.

Only a handful knew about Nydia and Jason's relationship—and the Chambers Group was one of them.

They had dared to lay hands on him.

"Jason, how did you get in here?" Alexander asked tightly.

"I was ambushed by their men, but I fought my way out. Stole a guard's pass." Jason's voice was hoarse with pain.

Alexander's eyes burned with fury. "The Chambers family really went all out to stop you."

Keeping his composure, he said calmly, "You're badly hurt. Gordon will take you to the hospital—now."

"No! I have to see Nydia—I have to take her away!" Jason's desperation was palpable.

"Jason, think," Alexander snapped. "Isabella's efforts gave you a chance. But if you act recklessly tonight, you'll lose everything."

"Chance?" Jason laughed bitterly. "Emeric already agreed to the marriage. It's over! And Nydia—she's too gentle. She'll obey her family. If I don't fight for her now, there is no chance!"

Alexander understood his despair all too well. Even with his power and influence, he had risked it all for Isabella.

Jason was just a subordinate—his background insignificant compared to the Sinclairs. His love for Nydia faced impossible odds.

"Jason," Isabella demanded, her voice deadly calm, "who ordered this?"

Jason shook his head. "I tried to force my way in, but Bertha and her people stopped me. Byron's secretary was there too. I don't know if it was Byron or Bertha who gave the order."

Isabella's gaze turned glacial. "All Chambers, all the same rotten blood. If we can't pinpoint the culprit, we'll bring down the whole family."

Meanwhile, Nydia remained oblivious to Jason's suffering.

Lost in thought, she barely registered Byron's attempts at conversation.

Her mind was filled with only one person—Jason.

As she bent to pick up her dropped phone, Byron's hand brushed against hers.

She recoiled instantly.

But Byron seized her wrist.

"Ah!"

She gasped in shock.

"Byron, what the hell are you doing?"

"I'm sorry—truly." His voice dripped with false remorse. "Your hand is just so beautiful. I couldn't help myself. Please forgive me."

His eyes gleamed with crocodile tears. "Avery has always loved your sister—you know that. Marrying him would ruin your life. But I genuinely care for you. Why not choose me? It's the best outcome!"

"Enough!"

Nydia's face burned with humiliation. "My mother may not have been my father's wife, but that doesn't mean you can disrespect me like this!"

Her voice shook with fury. "I'm not interested in you or Avery. But at least Avery never laid hands on me. He's better than you. Don't waste your time—I'm not choosing you!"

With that, she stormed out of the banquet hall.

He's better than you.

The words struck Byron like a whip.

His face twisted with rage.

Trembling, he pulled out his phone and texted his secretary:

[Tonight, I will have her.]
###Chapter 473

The humiliating encounter with Byron's inappropriate behavior left Isabella Sinclair too ashamed to confide in her father or brother. With flushed cheeks and unshed tears, she fled the crowded banquet hall.

As she pushed through the throng, a waiter bumped into her.

A sharp sting pierced her arm—like a bee's prick—but the pain vanished as quickly as it came.

"My apologies, Miss," the waiter murmured.

Isabella barely acknowledged him before hurrying away.

Behind her, the waiter smirked.

The night breeze tousled Isabella's hair as she stood alone on a secluded balcony, staring at the cold moonlight while wiping silent tears.

If only Alexander Kingsley were here. He would never let her suffer such indignity.

But she had resolved to let him go. From now on, he would no longer be part of her life.

Should she make one last call? Say everything she needed to say?

After a long hesitation, Isabella turned on her phone with trembling hands.

The moment it connected, notifications flooded in—missed calls, messages—all from Alexander. Every word dripped with desperation.

Her chest tightened, heart shattering. She bit her lip until it bled, tears falling uncontrollably.

"Alexander... I don't want to leave you."

Suddenly, her vision darkened. Her body swayed, legs buckling.

"Isabella? What's wrong?"

A voice called out, but her mind was foggy, ears ringing.

Then—rough hands yanked her into a suffocating embrace. Fingers groped her shoulder.

"Who are you? Let go!"

She tried to fight, but her limbs were weak. Panic surged as tears welled.

"Relax, sweetheart," the man sneered, lips brushing her cheek. "I'll take good care of you."

Meanwhile, Dominic Ashbourne played the role of President K, mingling with elites.

A bodyguard rushed over, sweating profusely, and pulled him aside.

"Mr. Ashbourne—Miss Isabella is missing!"

Dominic's heart lurched. His face darkened. "How? With security this tight and you watching her?"

"She was talking to Byron earlier, but then—"

"Byron?"

A cold dread settled in Dominic's gut.

The bodyguard stammered, "A crowd passed by, and suddenly—both were gone!"

"Idiot!" Dominic's fury erupted, veins bulging. "Find her. Now. If she isn't found before this ends, you're finished."

The Ashbourne guards scattered, combing the estate.

Dominic abandoned diplomacy and joined the search.

Isabella wasn't his blood sister, but as the eldest, he felt responsible. He couldn't fail her.

And he couldn't tell Evangeline—her temper would burn the entire party to the ground.

Isabella, stay safe!

His footsteps echoed urgently as he dialed her number.

No answer.

Then—a faint ringtone.

Heart pounding, he followed the sound to the balcony.

There lay Isabella's phone, screen flashing: Big Brother.

"Isabella! Where are you?"

Silence.

"Dominic, how could she just vanish?"

Evangeline and Thaddeus arrived, followed by a wounded Alexander. "This place is locked down. She couldn't have left!"

Alexander was on the verge of collapse, blood mixing with tears.

Dominic punched the railing. "My fault. I was careless."

Thaddeus gripped Evangeline's shaking shoulders. "No one would dare harm Chairman Emeric's daughter. Check the surveillance."

Dominic's eyes burned. "I'll have it pulled immediately."

"Too slow!" Evangeline snapped. "Every second risks her safety. Get me a laptop. I'll hack the system myself."

Dominic and Alexander had forgotten—

Evangeline was a world-class hacker, trained by the legendary agent Elijah.

Thaddeus watched her, admiration flaring.

His woman was extraordinary.

Dominic procured the fastest laptop available.

Evangeline's fingers flew across the keyboard, code blurring across the screen.

The three men stared, mesmerized.

Ten minutes later, footage loaded—

Isabella, entangled with a man.

Byron.

"That bastard!" Thaddeus snarled.

But the eerie part? Isabella seemed willing, arms wrapped around him.

Evangeline's breath hitched. "Isabella and Byron?"

Alexander's heart plummeted. "No. She'd never."

"Something's wrong," Dominic growled.

The footage showed them heading upstairs—then vanishing.

Dominic, usually composed, lost it. "We stop him now!"

Alexander's world crumbled.

If Byron touched her, he'd make him suffer.

Even if she was no longer untouched, he'd marry her. To him, she'd always be pure.

Evangeline cursed. "I should've let that bastard die on the operating table!"

Thaddeus acted fast. "Byron couldn't have done this alone. Secure his men."

A blade flashed—Dominic's dagger, cold as his voice. "It's been too long since this tasted blood."

Meanwhile, drugged and unaware, Isabella was carried into a guest room.

Byron tossed her onto the bed.

Her body burned, lips parted, breathing shallow.

He stripped hastily—then froze.

He couldn't get hard.

Panic set in. He tried everything. Nothing worked.

If she woke now, he'd be accused of assault.

Cursing Evangeline—her botched surgery must've caused this—he tore Isabella's clothes off instead.

Her bare skin gleamed, but his body refused to respond.

"Damn it!"

A crash shattered the silence.

Byron scrambled under the covers.

"Who's there?"

"Your reckoning."

Thaddeus stormed in, yanked Byron out by his hair, and flung him to the floor—exposing his bare backside and prosthetic leg.

"Evangeline, don't look."

She spat at Byron, then rushed to the bed. "You're dead!"

"Isabella!"

Alexander stumbled forward, wrapping her gently in the sheets.

Even now, he wouldn't look at her exposed skin.

He cradled her like fragile glass, whispering, "I'm here. No one will hurt you again."

Isabella's eyelids fluttered open.
###Chapter 474

The moment Alexander carried Isabella into the room, stripping her clothes, violating and humiliating her—

She had flickers of awareness through it all.

But her body refused to obey.

Her limbs were leaden, her eyelids too heavy to lift.

She couldn’t fight back.

That helplessness made the violation even crueler.

She would’ve rather been unconscious.

Better yet—dead.

Tears spilled from Isabella’s eyes as she let out a broken sob, writhing in Nathan’s arms.

“Don’t touch me! Please—don’t!”

“Isabella! Look at me.” Nathan’s voice cracked, his grip tightening around her. Tears shimmered in his eyes. “It’s me. Nathan.”

His chest burned as if a jagged blade had carved through it, his heart ripped out and crushed in a merciless fist.

Hearing his voice, a flicker of recognition passed through Isabella’s vacant gaze.

She stared at him—first in disbelief, then tentative hope.

“Nathan?”

He choked on his words, nodding desperately.

“What happened?” Her breath hitched as she noticed the blood staining his left eye. In that moment, her own pain was forgotten—her only concern was for him.

Evangeline’s eyes burned crimson, her chest heaving with fury.

Why did this couple have to suffer so much?

What sin had they committed to deserve such torment?

Her rage surged—not just at Byron, but at Emeric.

Byron was vile, but if Emeric hadn’t forced Isabella into an engagement with Avery, none of this would’ve happened.

Byron had ignored Isabella before.

Now, suddenly, he was obsessed.

Using her as a pawn to gain power over the Chambers Group.

Disgusting.

“It’s okay.” Nathan’s voice was rough, tears mingling with blood as they slid down his face. “I’m here. I’ll take you away.”

He tried to lift her, but Isabella shoved him back.

“We’re over, Nathan.”

He froze, staring at her pale face. “No. I refuse.” His voice was steel. “I’d rather die than lose you.”

“I’m tainted.” Her attempt at a smile shattered him. “I’m not worthy of you anymore.”

“Don’t say that!” His grip tightened. “You could never be tainted. You’re perfect. I’ll love you no matter what.”

Isabella shook her head. “If I stay with you like this, I’ll never forgive myself. You deserve better.”

Evangeline turned away, wiping her tears furiously.

Her gaze landed on a vase.

She grabbed it and smashed it against the wall.

Shards exploded, leaving only a jagged, lethal neck in her hand.

“Byron, you filthy animal!” Her voice was a snarl. “I’ll castrate you!”

Byron, sprawled on the floor like a wounded rat, let out a shrill scream.

A dark stain spread across the carpet beneath him.

The once-arrogant heir was now a trembling mess.

As Evangeline lunged, Thaddeus caught her wrist.

“Are you stopping me?” She glared at him, chest heaving.

“No.” His voice was soft, coaxing. “I just don’t want you to dirty your hands.”

His fingers slid over hers, gently prying the shard from her grip.

Evangeline exhaled, rationality returning.

Thaddeus’s expression darkened.

With a sharp snap, he crushed the vase’s neck into dust.

Evangeline blinked.

Damn.

That was hot.

But didn’t that hurt?

Thaddeus dusted off his hands. “No need for weapons. I could snap his neck with my bare hands.”

Byron’s face twisted in panic. “You—you wouldn’t dare! My father will destroy you!”

Evangeline smirked. “Perfect. I’ve been waiting to dismantle the Chambers family.”

She drove her stiletto into Byron’s hand, pinning him like a bug.

He howled.

“You asked for this.” Her voice was ice. “And Bertha’s next.”

Bertha?

Had Evangeline uncovered their conspiracy?

Fear choked Byron. “You—you have no proof! Your sister was all over me! She wanted it!”

Isabella trembled with rage.

But how could she prove otherwise? She’d been helpless.

Nathan roared, “You’re lying! You drugged her!”

Byron sneered. “Where’s your evidence? Even the surveillance shows her clinging to me!”

Thaddeus’s foot pressed down on Byron’s spine.

A sickening crack echoed.

Byron screamed as his tailbone shattered.

Evangeline wanted to drive her heel through his skull. “Isabella doesn’t drink! You drugged her!”

“Prove it,” Byron taunted, panting through the pain.

Just then, a chilling voice cut through the room.

“Do you really think you covered your tracks?”

Cassius stepped forward, tossing something onto the floor.

Byron’s secretary—hogtied, limbs twisted unnaturally.

His tendons had been severed.

Byron’s blood ran cold.

The secretary whimpered. “I—I’ll talk! Mr. Chambers made me get liquid ecstasy! It leaves no trace!”

Liquid ecstasy?

Thaddeus frowned. “What’s that?”

Chasel’s expression darkened. “GHB. Overdose causes unconsciousness, disorientation—total vulnerability.”

A chill swept through the room.

Nathan gripped Isabella’s shoulders. “Did you drink anything?”

She shook her head. “Just juice. Nothing else.”

Byron laughed hysterically. “No proof! She threw herself at me!”

His smug grin faltered as Cassius stepped forward.

“Wrong.” His voice was deadly. “We have your secretary’s confession.”

Byron’s face paled.

Game over.
###Chapter 475

Nathaniel exploded into motion like a detonated grenade, his entire body coiled for attack!

Just as he lunged forward, Isabella seized his wrist with bone-white knuckles. "Don't," she pleaded, voice trembling. "Nathaniel, please."

After all, Harrison was the golden heir of the Vanderbilt dynasty, and she had the Ashbourne name shielding her—but what about Nathaniel?

She couldn't let him drown in this mess because of her.

Before Nathaniel could react, Arabella moved like lightning—a striker delivering a championship-winning kick straight to Harrison's face!

"Ugh—"

The impact sent Harrison's front teeth flying, leaving his mouth a bloody cavern with two grotesque gaps.

Lucas inhaled sharply, his Adam's apple bobbing in silent awe.

His almond eyes narrowed, lips curling upward.

So fierce. So unapologetically bold. He was utterly smitten.

"Damn." Preston shuddered, pressing closer to Alexander for support. "Your sister's terrifying. She's got gang leader energy—violence first, questions later. Hey, as her brother-in-law, you should get Lucas some life insurance. Consider it a wedding gift."

"Dr. Lockwood," Alexander's voice dripped sarcasm, "don't you have patients to attend to?"

"Arabella." Harrison spat blood through his ruined smile, words whistling between gaps. "You've got no proof. But what you and Lucas did? I'll bury you both in lawsuits! Your reputations will be ash!"

"You think I care?" Arabella cracked her knuckles, lips twisted in contempt. "Keep talking, and I'll remove the rest of your teeth."

Harrison promptly shut his mouth.

"You've already done so much." Isabella leaned weakly into Nathaniel's embrace, tears streaking her cheeks. "Let it go. Please."

Timid as she was, her greatest fear was dragging her family into the abyss with her.

"Bullshit." Lucas's voice was steel wrapped in velvet. "Over my dead body."

The endearment "sister" sent warmth flooding Arabella's chest. She exchanged a grateful glance with Nathaniel.

Preston approached Isabella with uncharacteristic gentleness. "Ms. Isabella, I know you're exhausted, but try to recall—what happened before you blacked out? Even tiny details matter."

Alexander arched a brow. He'd never seen the sharp-tongued doctor this tender.

Isabella frowned. "I... bumped into a waiter. Felt a sting on my arm—like a bee. It faded fast."

Arabella yanked back the blanket. There—a tiny puncture mark on Isabella's porcelain skin.

"You bastard!" Arabella's roar shook the walls. "What did you inject into my sister?!"

"Proof!" Harrison sneered, though sweat soaked his collar. "She came onto me! This is a setup!"

Lucas grabbed Harrison's hair, wrenching his head back. "If that substance harmed my sister, I'll turn you into a pincushion."

Preston checked Isabella's pulse, then exhaled. "Anesthetic side effects—rapid heart rate, fever. One dose shouldn't cause lasting damage, but she needs bloodwork."

"Thank you," Nathaniel choked out.

"Please." Preston's gaze flicked to Alexander. "We're practically family."

As they debated Harrison's fate, Lucas's phone rang. He put it on speaker.

"Lucas! Called it!" Adrian's voice crackled with excitement. "Caught a 'waiter' sneaking out—turns out he's Vanderbilt security!"

Harrison's face turned sheet-white.

"Good work." Lucas's calm tone belied the menace beneath. "Hold him until after dinner, then hand him to police."

"Or," Adrian chuckled darkly, "keep him as your personal punching bag. Arabella might enjoy that."

Arabella rolled her eyes.

Harrison was shaking now. "Ms. Arabella, I beg you! It was a moment of madness—I just wanted to one-up my brother! For our fathers' friendship, spare me!"

"Rot in jail." Arabella's smile was arctic. "But first, our family will teach you manners."

In desperation, Harrison blurted the humiliating truth: "I can't even get it up! The meds ruined me! I just stripped her to fake it!"

The room froze.

"Karma," Arabella spat. "You deserve to die childless. But you still violated her with your eyes. Gouge them out, and maybe I'll spare your miserable life!"

Harrison whimpered. Crippled was bad enough—blind would be unbearable.

Then Alexander and Lucas's phones rang simultaneously.

Emeric and Frederick. Summoning them back for an announcement—the partnership decision.

"Go," Alexander said, eyeing the human trash at his feet. "Preston and I will clean up here."

"Sis!" Isabella grabbed Arabella's sleeve, eyes swimming. "Don't tell Dad. His health... I can't—"

"I'll handle it." Arabella squeezed her hand, voice thick. "Even if it costs everything, I'll sever you from the Vanderbilts."
###Chapter 476

The grand banquet hall buzzed with energy as the lavish dance party reached its crescendo. The spotlight swiveled to center stage, illuminating Alexander Kingsley and his son, commanding the room's undivided attention.

Tension crackled between members of the Abernathy Group and Fairhaven Group, their gazes locked onto Alexander. For Fairhaven, securing this deal meant salvation from financial ruin. For Abernathy, it was an opportunity to assert dominance—and perhaps settle old scores with Isabella.

But Emeric Ashbourne remained detached from the corporate frenzy. His mind was elsewhere, consumed by his daughter’s sudden disappearance. His beloved Isabella had vanished—was she tangled up with that Abernathy heir again? Their closeness had already raised eyebrows.

A flush crept up Emeric’s neck as his imagination conjured scandalous scenarios. He wasn’t a prude, and Isabella had once been married to the man. They’d even lived together under his roof, yet no grandchild had materialized—much to his conflicted relief.

But even thrill-seekers had their limits.

His thoughts shattered when he realized his usually obedient younger daughter, Natalia, was also missing. As confusion knitted his brow, a striking couple emerged, effortlessly stealing the room’s focus.

"Dad."

"Chairman Ashbourne."

Emeric’s stern expression softened at the sight of them. A smile tugged at his lips, pride swelling in his chest as he watched Isabella and Nathaniel together—their devotion palpable, their eyes speaking volumes.

Nathaniel, once the target of Emeric’s disdain, was growing on him.

"Where have you been?" Emeric chided, masking concern with playful reproach. Noticing her pallor, his tone sharpened. "You look unwell. Should I call your brother to take you to the hospital?"

Isabella’s face was shadowed. "I’m fine."

"And your brother? I called him—why isn’t he here?"

"He’s delayed. He’ll arrive soon." Her voice was flat, devoid of warmth.

Emeric frowned. "And Natalia? I haven’t seen her in a while."

Nathaniel’s jaw tightened, his gaze glacial, while Isabella’s icy stare landed on Jeffrey.

"Oh, Emeric!" Jeffrey Chambers interjected, his tone jovial. "You must’ve forgotten. Natalia and Byron were deep in conversation during the dance. Young love—they probably slipped away for some privacy."

Jeffrey chuckled, buoyant. "I’ve watched Natalia grow up. She’s always been the quiet one. Who knew she’d find such chemistry with Byron?"

Isabella’s laugh was a blade. Jeffrey stiffened but forced a smile. "Isabella, you seem upset. Did someone offend you?"

"Mr. Chambers," she countered, eyes narrowing, "my sister has zero interest in your son. Are you blind, or just desperate?"

Jeffrey’s smile froze. This insolent girl!

Had Emeric spoiled her rotten? Or had Nathaniel and Avery’s attention inflated her ego? Did she truly think she could act so brazenly?

"Isabella!" Emeric snapped. "Mind your manners!"

Jeffrey feigned magnanimity. "As her godfather, I’ll overlook her rudeness. Without Isabella’s medical skills, Byron wouldn’t even be standing today."

The mention ignited her fury. "My greatest regret, Mr. Chambers? Saving your son."

Jeffrey’s face darkened.

"Enough!" Emeric barked. "Apologize!"

Nathaniel finally spoke, his voice calm but firm. "Chairman Ashbourne, don’t mistake her words for mere rudeness. There’s a reason behind them. Everything will make sense soon."

As Isabella met his gaze, the storm in her eyes stilled.

Jeffrey bristled. "This is a family matter, Abernathy. Stay out of it."

Nathaniel smirked, his silence more unnerving than words.

Nearby, Edith watched, jealousy gnawing at her. Nathaniel and Isabella looked like royalty together. What had they been doing all this time? Her imagination tormented her—until a strangled gasp escaped her lips.

Disdainful glances shot her way.

Frederic Abernathy suppressed a grimace. How was this scatterbrain related to Jareth?

Truthfully, Isabella was the better match for his son—graceful, sharp, formidable. Edith? An afterthought.

But Isabella was dangerous. A viper in silk.

"Ladies and gentlemen," Ford Morris announced, taking the stage. "Thank you for joining us tonight. Our partnership with Abernathy Group thrives, and for our Equestrian Hotel venture, we seek another formidable ally."

Eyes darted between Frederic and Jeffrey.

Emeric, an outsider, didn’t mind being overlooked. But Barry Fairhaven seethed. Were they truly so insignificant?

Ford yielded the stage to his father, William.

"After careful consideration," William declared, "J Group will collaborate with K Group for the Equestrian Hotel."

Silence. Then—applause.

Emeric, stunned, stepped forward, shaking William’s hand.

"The honor is ours," he said smoothly.

"Nonsense. Your victory at the races proved your mettle. A promise is a promise."

Unbeknownst to all, William had consulted Chad Abernathy earlier.

"Work with K Group," Chad had advised. "It benefits us both. Consider it my tribute to Isabella—I’d hate to see her efforts wasted."

Isabella’s composure cracked—just slightly—as joy flickered in her eyes.

Nathaniel’s hand found hers, warm and reassuring. "Congratulations. Victory was always yours."

Electricity sparked where their skin met. Her pulse quickened.

As Emeric basked in triumph, Frederic and Barry barely concealed their fury.

Jeffrey, though smiling, seethed. The Ashbournes shone while he gained nothing.

Frederic forced a smile and approached Emeric.

"Congratulations, Chairman Ashbourne."

"Thank you. The feeling is mutual."

Frederic’s grin turned razor-sharp. "Since we’re all gathered, I’d like to share some joyous news of my own."
###Chapter 477

The crowd pressed in closer, their gazes locked onto Alexander Kingsley's enigmatic smile.

With a sly glint in his eye, Alexander turned his attention to Sebastian Lockwood. "Sebastian, come here."

Sebastian's chest tightened inexplicably. His brow furrowed as he glanced at the petite woman beside him, his grip on her hand unconsciously tightening—he couldn't bear the thought of letting her go.

"Go. I'll be right here watching you. I won't leave."

Isabella Sinclair met his gaze with tender eyes, gently pulling her hand free, now reddened from his firm hold.

Left with no choice, Sebastian made his way to Alexander under the scrutiny of the gathered guests.

Alexander greeted him with a rare paternal smile, clapping a hand on his broad shoulder before addressing the crowd with a booming laugh.

"Tonight, as we celebrate the new venture between Chairman Sinclair and Mr. Nathaniel Whitmore, I’d like to announce a joyous occasion for our family. My son Sebastian is engaged to Valentina Rossi, granddaughter of the esteemed Mr. Dominic Vanderbilt of the Vanderbilt Group. The engagement party will be held this month!"

The crowd gasped. Sebastian and Valentina—engaged?!

Some turned to look at Valentina, the soon-to-be Mrs. Kingsley, anointed by Alexander Kingsley himself.

Valentina trembled with excitement, her eyes shining with ecstasy, on the verge of tears.

She had waited for this moment for what felt like an eternity, her family pulling every string to secure Alexander’s favor, to finally triumph over Isabella and turn her into a laughingstock!

The slights she had endured would finally be avenged. Meanwhile, others stared at Isabella with stunned, pitying expressions.

Isabella’s face drained of color, her slender frame trembling as if plunged into an icy river of endless darkness. The warmth Sebastian had once given her now turned to ice.

The pain was unbearable, her mind a blank void.

Valentina watched her with a wild, triumphant smile. Oh, how lovely, Isabella. Seeing you stripped of your pride, so lost and pathetic—it’s a beautiful sight!

"The Kingsley Group and the Vanderbilt Group uniting? That’s monumental! But why wasn’t there any hint of this before? It feels so sudden!"

"Isn’t this just the Kingsley way? Remember when Isabella and Sebastian married? They kept it under wraps until the divorce. Their three-year marriage was a well-kept secret, and now it’s the same tactic with the Vanderbilts."

"Wait—if Sebastian is engaged to Valentina, what was all that deep affection for Isabella about?"

"Maybe they were in love, but Mr. Alexander Kingsley disapproved. I never believed in Sebastian and Isabella lasting. Elspeth was thrown under the bus because of Ms. Sinclair’s schemes—the Kingsley family secrets nearly got exposed! If I were Alexander, no matter how talented or beautiful the woman, I wouldn’t want her in my family."

The murmurs were like knives, each word stabbing at Isabella’s bleeding heart.

William Sinclair was thunderstruck, disbelief and fury churning within him.

His precious daughter had already been humiliated in the divorce, and now, with Sebastian and Isabella’s reconciliation known to the world, their affection had been on full display.

And now, Alexander had orchestrated an alliance with the Vanderbilts, an engagement between Sebastian and Valentina?! He couldn’t believe Alexander genuinely wanted this union—he was using Sebastian, Isabella’s most cherished person, to take revenge on her, on him!

Despicable, petty schemer!

Nathaniel Whitmore blinked in surprise. "Well, that’s certainly grand news! Congratulations, Mr. Alexander Kingsley, and to you, Mr. Sebastian Kingsley."

"Are you joking, Alexander?"

Sebastian’s fists clenched until his knuckles turned white, rage and panic crashing over him like a tidal wave. His eyes burned with defiance as he spoke through gritted teeth.

"Everyone knows I love Isabella, and I will love her until death. Now you want me to marry Valentina? I don’t care what deal you’ve struck with the Vanderbilts—even if you threaten your own life, I will never marry her!"

The crowd was stunned into silence. Even Nathaniel and his son were dumbfounded by Sebastian’s bold defiance.

Daniel Carter, who had initially sneered at Sebastian, couldn’t help but feel a flicker of respect. "Damn. That’s bold."

"Did Mr. Sebastian Kingsley just say that? That’s explosive!"

"This father-son showdown is about to blow up!"

"If I were Alexander, my blood pressure would skyrocket! Sebastian basically said, 'To hell with your life, nothing stops me from being with Isabella.' His father’s life means less to him than Ms. Sinclair!"

Isabella’s tear-filled eyes locked onto Sebastian as if he were the only person in the world who could move her soul.

The guests exchanged glances, their expressions shifting toward the Vanderbilts.

"What’s going on? It seems Sebastian had no idea about this arranged marriage—like Alexander just traded him off."

"Isn’t it wrong to force a marriage like this?"

"The Vanderbilts are even worse. Knowing Sebastian is devoted to Isabella, they push Valentina on him, making this awkward for everyone."

"If I were Valentina, I’d be mortified. Who’s she trying to fool?"

"Valentina probably doesn’t care—she’s over the moon at the chance to be Mrs. Kingsley!"

Valentina’s face flushed with humiliation at the whispers.

Dominic Vanderbilt wasn’t faring much better, his pride wounded. He knew this gamble was risky—even if Alexander agreed, Sebastian was a wild card.

But Dominic had assumed that with the engagement announced publicly, Sebastian would at least keep up appearances until the party ended.

Once the news spread, any rebellion would tarnish Sebastian’s reputation. With media manipulation, they could paint him as fickle, forcing the Kingsleys to comply.

But they had underestimated Sebastian’s love for Isabella. He stood firm, unyielding.

"Marriage isn’t a game. You don’t get to refuse!"

Alexander stepped forward, glaring up at his taller son. "This isn’t up for debate!" His voice was laced with barely contained fury. "Even if you don’t marry Valentina, Isabella will never be part of this family!"

"Then I’ll marry no one but Isabella."

Though their exchange was meant to be private, Sebastian’s declaration was heard by all.

A single tear slipped from Isabella’s red-rimmed eyes. She moved toward Sebastian, but William grabbed her wrist, pulling her back.

"Isabella, where do you think you’re going?" he demanded sternly.

"Dad, please trust him," she whispered, her voice hoarse. The usually sharp and composed woman was reduced to one thought—being by his side.

William’s heart ached. "I haven’t said I don’t trust him. But look at the situation. If he’s truly the man you believe him to be, let’s see how he handles this mess."

The tension was suffocating.

Sebastian’s outright rejection was a slap to the Vanderbilts’ faces.

Unable to contain his anger, Dominic stormed forward with his granddaughter, who played the victim perfectly.

"Mr. Sebastian Kingsley! Loving Ms. Sinclair is your choice. But leaving my granddaughter humiliated for over half a year? Are you treating her as less than human?!"

Valentina burst into theatrical sobs.

"What’s wrong with demanding responsibility? If you love Ms. Sinclair so much, why did you get entangled with my granddaughter in the first place?!"

Dominic’s words were sharp, calculated. "Are you this reckless because of your friendship with my grandson, or because you think my granddaughter—orphaned young, with no one to defend her—is an easy target?"

His words made the guests recall the scandal involving Sebastian and Valentina. Back then, the Vanderbilts had pressured the Kingsleys, but Sebastian remained indifferent, leaving Valentina to retreat in silence.

Sebastian’s cold gaze locked onto Valentina, making her flinch. His voice was icy, assertive.

"I have never touched your granddaughter, nor have I had any private dealings with her. The hotel incident was a setup, and I’ve been investigating it. Even if Ms. Rossi doesn’t care about her reputation, I won’t let my name be tarnished. I won’t betray the woman I love."

His final words left no doubt about his feelings for Isabella.

The guests murmured, their opinions of Valentina shifting. If Sebastian was telling the truth, had she orchestrated the scandal to trap him?

"Grandpa, I had nothing to do with that! I’m the victim here!" Valentina clung to Dominic’s arm, her makeup ruined by tears.

Dominic refused to believe his granddaughter capable of deceit, dismissing Sebastian’s words as excuses.

"Sebastian, it’s time to choose—and choose wisely." Alexander’s voice was low, threatening. "If you pick Valentina, I’ll name you my heir. I’ll transfer 10% of my Kingsley Group shares to you immediately, making you the largest shareholder. But if you insist on Isabella, you’ll lose everything—your inheritance, your position as CEO. By Monday, you’ll be out of the company for good."

Before Alexander could finish, Sebastian was already striding toward the woman standing a short distance away, waiting for him in silence.

His Isabella. The love of his life. Priceless.
###Chapter 478

The ballroom lights shimmered like fallen stars as Isabella's tear-filled eyes locked with Alexander's burning gaze. In that moment, the world around them dissolved into nothingness.

Alexander's steps toward her were deliberate, weighted—as if he'd crossed oceans and scaled mountains just to reach her side.

Beside Isabella stood her father, his usually composed face now etched with raw emotion, his eyes glistening with unshed tears.

He was walking toward his future, his heart pounding so loudly it drowned out the murmurs of the crowd. The scene before him felt surreal, too perfect to be real.

"Isabella."

A single tear traced down her porcelain cheek, catching the light like a diamond.

For her, he would defy the world. And she would do the same.

From the battlefields of Zenithia to the day she'd defied her family and the Abernathy Group's icy disapproval to marry him—they had fought for their love with everything they had.

"Wait!"

Victoria's shrill voice sliced through the air, her face flushed with fury. She couldn't take it anymore.

Hope had dangled before her, only to be snatched away cruelly. She wouldn't stand for it!

"Isabella, Alexander, you think you can just be together?" she seethed inwardly. "Fine. Let me carve a wound so deep between you that it never heals."

The crowd turned toward Victoria, their expressions a mix of irritation and pity. What was the point of this now?

Victoria's lips twisted into a grotesque smirk, her face ashen, her presence chilling.

"Mr. Frederic Abernathy, I know the Fairhaven name pales next to the Ashbournes'. If you must choose between me and Isabella as your daughter-in-law, you'd feel cheated. But mark my words—choosing her will be your greatest regret."

Her words painted her as the victim while stoking curiosity, especially in Frederic's calculating gaze.

"And Chairman Ashbourne," she turned to Emeric, feigning concern, "Isabella is your pride. Could you bear to see her suffer? Do you truly believe Alexander Abernathy is worthy of her?"

Confusion rippled through the guests.

Isabella's eyes darkened, sensing the venom in Victoria's words. Before she could speak, Emeric's voice boomed, "Victoria Fairhaven, speak plainly. What is your point?"

His authority was crushing, making even bystanders shiver.

Just then, Daniel and Nathaniel arrived, having dealt with Byron. They stepped into the hall in time to witness the chaos. Daniel's stomach twisted as he exchanged a glance with Nathaniel.

"Damn it. I turn my back for one second, and she's causing trouble again!" Nathaniel clenched his fists, ready to intervene, but Daniel grabbed his arm.

"Mr. Nathaniel Fairhaven, don’t act rashly. My father and Alexander are here. And with your upcoming CEO appointment, siding against your family will only hurt your future."

Nathaniel's jaw tightened. "Loyalty to my friend comes first. If I let my own blood hurt the woman he loves, what kind of man am I?"

Daniel's expression flickered with understanding.

Alexander's gaze was glacial as he watched Victoria, ready to strike her down where she stood.

"Bring it here!" Victoria commanded.

This wasn’t just a trump card—it was a bomb. And she was ready to detonate it.

An assistant hurried forward, handing her a sealed envelope.

"Alexander Abernathy, you were secretly married to Isabella for three years, yet you betrayed her with Elspeth's niece. You left her to live like a ghost in her own marriage."

She smirked. "For three years, you ignored her love, her pain—even pushed her to divorce. Have I lied?"

The accusations weren’t new, but the wounds still ached.

Alexander's voice was hoarse. "Yes. I admit it."

"Do you really think that’s all you’ve done?" Victoria laughed. "Think harder."

A sharp pain lanced through Alexander's skull.

Isabella's breath hitched—she knew what was coming.

Victoria nodded to her assistant. "Give this to Chairman Ashbourne. I doubt anyone else here wants to know what his precious daughter endured."

The assistant handed the envelope to Emeric.

"Dad, don’t—"

Emeric tore it open, his face draining of color. His hands trembled as if holding poison.

"Isabella, is this true?"

His voice was raw, his eyes a storm of love and fury as he hurled the document at her. "Tell me!"

Isabella swayed, clutching her chest as she bent to pick it up.

"Isabella." Alexander stepped forward, lost.

She whispered, "Yes. It’s all true."

Emeric staggered as if struck by lightning.

Daniel and Nathaniel stood frozen, especially Daniel—he’d never seen his father look at Isabella with such fury.

Emeric seized Isabella’s arm, dragging her toward the exit. "We’re leaving. You’re coming home."

"Dad—"

"And you will never see Alexander again. If you defy me, you’ll never leave Silverlake."

Alexander felt the world crumble beneath him.

Victoria smirked. "Locking her away won’t change the truth. The child she lost for Alexander would have been two months along. Because of him, she can never bear children again."

A child?

Alexander’s entire body locked in shock.

The crowd gasped.

Isabella, the Ashbourne heiress, stripped of motherhood because of him?

Daniel’s legs nearly gave out, Nathaniel barely catching him.

Victoria turned to Frederic. "Mr. Abernathy, surely you can’t let this stand? How could Isabella, barren, continue the Abernathy line?"

Frederic’s gaze sharpened. "Alexander, if you love her, let her go. Let her find peace."

Peace?

Alexander shook his head, his vision blurring. Their child was gone, and he hadn’t even known.

"Victoria."

Nathaniel’s voice was lethal as he stepped forward.

"What now, Nathaniel? It’s too late for words," she sneered.

A sharp crack echoed through the hall as Nathaniel backhanded her so hard she crumpled to the floor, blood trickling from her lips.

Gasps erupted.

He wiped his hand with a handkerchief, his voice icy. "If karma won’t punish you, I will."
###Chapter 479

The world spun violently as Isabella Sinclair collapsed to her knees, her vision exploding with white-hot stars. The coppery tang of blood flooded her mouth, her ears ringing with a deafening, high-pitched scream. Pain radiated through her skull, her entire body convulsing as she curled in on herself, teeth bared in silent agony.

Dignity? Poise? Gone.

All that remained was raw, unfiltered suffering.

"Ah—God! My ear!" she shrieked, clawing at the side of her head. "It's—it's killing me!"

Two brutal strikes to her right cheek had left her ear ringing, the pain so sharp it stole her breath. She writhed on the floor, tears streaming down her face.

"Oh, Isabella! My poor girl!"

Nathaniel Prescott's weathered face twisted in horror as he rushed to her side, his cane clattering to the floor. His bony hands trembled as he tried to pull her up, but she was limp, broken.

"Grandfather," she sobbed, her voice barely audible, "I can't—I can't hear anything. My ear—it's bleeding!"

Nathaniel's face drained of color. "What did you say?!"

But even his booming voice, inches from her, sounded like a whisper. Isabella's fingers came away from her ear slick with crimson. The sight sent her into hysterics. "I'm deaf! I'm going deaf!"

Chaos erupted. Bodyguards shouted for doctors. Secretaries scrambled for phones. The scene was pure pandemonium—like a bomb had gone off in the middle of the gala.

Alexander Kingsley watched the Sinclair family's meltdown with icy detachment, as if an invisible barrier separated him from their theatrics.

Once, he had been proud to bear the Sinclair name.

Now, it was a stain.

"Alexander!" Nathaniel roared, his face purpling with rage. "Have you lost your damn mind?! Isabella is your sister! Your parents' only daughter! How could you strike her like that?!"

A slow, chilling smile curled Alexander's lips. "As the eldest son, I am the acting head of this family in our father's absence. Do you find fault in my discipline?"

Gasps rippled through the crowd. The audacity. The sheer, unapologetic arrogance.

"You ungrateful wretch!" Nathaniel sputtered, veins bulging in his temples. "I am the patriarch of this family! How dare you raise your hand against your own flesh and blood in front of me? Have you no respect?!"

"Of course I do."

Alexander's eyes burned with a terrifying, blood-red intensity. "It's out of respect for you that I only slapped her insolent mouth. Otherwise, I might have killed her."

Silence.

Cassius Lockwood stared at Alexander, stunned. He'd always dismissed him as a reckless playboy, a man who coasted on charm and privilege. But this? This was loyalty. This was sacrifice.

And it humbled him.

Isabella trembled violently, burying her face in Nathaniel's chest.

Nathaniel was speechless, choking on his own fury.

"Alexander," Frederic Abernathy interjected smoothly, though his jaw was clenched tight. "Ms. Sinclair is still your sister. Such harsh words reflect poorly on you—and wound your family. There are no winners here."

He had expected this to go differently. Expected Alexander to stay out of it. But now, the bastard had flipped the script entirely.

The crowd's murmurs grew louder, their judgmental stares shifting to Frederic.

"Are you suggesting," Alexander drawled, tilting his head, "that Isabella bears no responsibility for exposing Ms. Ashbourne's private suffering in front of all these people? For ripping open her wounds just to satisfy her petty revenge?"

His words were a blade, stripping Isabella of her last shred of dignity.

And they cut deeper into Evelyn Ashbourne's already bleeding heart. She clenched her jaw, tears slipping free despite her best efforts. Each one was a dagger to Thaddeus Abernathy's soul.

Evelyn. Evelyn.

He ached to go to her. To pull her into his arms and kiss away her pain.

But did he even have the right anymore?

"Alexander," Frederic snapped, struggling to maintain his composure, "are you insulting me?"

"You're speaking in riddles. I'm a simple man—I take things at face value." Alexander shrugged, lazily cleaning his ear. "And for the record? I'm acquainted with your son, not you. So in the future, call me Mr. Kingsley. It suits me better."

Frederic's face darkened like he'd swallowed something rancid.

The crowd tittered.

"Isabella's pulling every dirty trick in the book to stop Evelyn from marrying Thaddeus," someone muttered.

"Disgusting. Parading someone's medical records like tabloid fodder? That's sacred, private stuff—for any woman, let alone someone like Evelyn Ashbourne."

"She's just jealous. If she can't have Thaddeus, no one can."

"That woman? A walking disaster. Even a stray dog would think twice."

"And Frederic's still pushing for her? What, is the Abernathy family a dumpster now?"

Frederic's ears burned. He'd miscalculated. Badly.

"Grandfather," Isabella whimpered, clutching her ear. "It—it hurts so much. I can't—I can't hear properly. Take me to the hospital, please!"

"Move!" Nathaniel barked. "Get her to a doctor—now!"

But before anyone could take a step, Cassius's voice cut through the room like a whip.

"Nobody moves."

The Sinclairs froze.

Isabella's blood ran cold.

Cassius strode forward, his expression glacial as he gently pried Emeric Ashbourne's grip from Evelyn's wrist. "Father," he said quietly, "losing your temper only plays into their hands. And you're hurting Evelyn."

Emeric blinked, finally noticing the angry red marks on his daughter's skin. His face crumpled.

"Cassius," Evelyn whispered, leaning into him. "I'm sorry."

Cassius pulled her close, his heart breaking. "Don't apologize. You've done nothing wrong."

Evelyn let out a bitter laugh.

How naive she'd been.

She thought hiding her pain would protect them.

But the truth always found a way out.

Cassius tightened his hold on her, his gaze flicking to Thaddeus's ashen face before dismissing him entirely. "I've mobilized all Ashbourne security. Until this is resolved, no Sinclair leaves this room."

That look shattered Thaddeus's last hope.

He didn't deserve her.

He never had.

The guests buzzed with excitement, eager for the drama. Only Nathaniel was furious, jabbing a finger at Cassius. "This is unlawful detention! I'll sue you!"

"Sue me," Cassius shot back. "But Isabella illegally obtained and publicly disseminated my sister's private medical records. The Ashbourne Group will countersue for invasion of privacy and defamation."

Just then, Jason Lockwood strode in, his suit immaculate, his injured eye hidden beneath a discreet bandage. He'd rushed here the moment he heard, refusing to let Evelyn face this alone.

Behind him, Nydia followed, her expression steely.

"Jason," Evelyn choked out.

"Tsk, tsk." Another voice joined the fray—Chasel, sauntering up beside Jason, his lips curled in disdain. "Who knew the Sinclair heiress was so legally illiterate? Or just plain stupid."

Cassius arched a brow, amused despite himself.

Chasel smirked. "You thought you had the upper hand, but all you did was dig your own grave. Exposing someone's private trauma? That's not strategy. That's self-destruction."

Emeric blinked, surprised by Chasel's presence—and his sharp tongue.

"You think the Sinclairs are pushovers?!" Nathaniel roared, slamming his cane down. "Call security! We're leaving—now!"

"Grandfather," Alexander sighed, feigning boredom. "Are you forgetting? I control Sinclair security. Without my order, not a single guard lifts a finger."

Nathaniel's face turned purple.

Game over.
###Chapter 480

Barry's memory flashed back to the years Jareth had spent overseeing Fairhaven Group's security forces. When he'd handed that department to Jareth, it had been nothing more than a gesture—a way to keep him occupied in a non-critical sector.

Now, that very delegation of authority had become a weapon turned against him.

"I've already coordinated with President Ashbourne," Jareth said coolly, his voice cutting through the tension. "This place is locked down tight."

Jareth's eyes narrowed, a dangerous glint flickering in their depths. "Grandpa Barry, I mean you no harm. If Edith confesses and repents for what she's done, you can walk out of here with your dignity intact."

"Jareth! How dare you!" Barry's veins bulged in fury, his face flushing crimson.

"Who's the one who truly dares here?"

Thaddeus stepped forward, his bloodshot eyes burning with the intensity of a lion roused from slumber. The air around him turned frigid, thick with barely restrained violence.

"Who's the one twisting right and wrong, shielding evil?" His voice was a low, lethal growl. "Who's the one who thought they could get away with hurting my woman—over and over again? It was you. And your granddaughter, who's worse than any beast!"

The sheer force of his presence left the room in stunned silence. No one dared so much as breathe too loudly.

Evadne, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears, gazed at him with aching tenderness. Even now, after everything, her heart still fluttered when he called her his.

Thaddeus clenched his fists, his muscles taut beneath his suit. The taste of blood lingered in his throat, his fury so consuming it threatened to burn the world down.

"Anyone who protects Edith is my enemy," he vowed, his voice raw. "And I will spend the rest of my life making sure they suffer. Don't believe me? Try me."

Barry had been a street fighter in his youth, no stranger to intimidation. But standing before this younger man, he felt his bravado crumble.

"Grandpa Barry, take me with you!" Edith clutched at his arm, her voice shrill with panic.

Was he seriously backing down? Over a few threats? Pathetic.

"Edith."

Evadne pushed through the pain, steadying herself before stepping away from her brother. She moved closer to Edith, her presence alone enough to make the other woman shrink back like a cornered animal.

"I have one question for you."

Evadne's eyes, dark and unreadable, locked onto hers. "This medical report claiming I'm infertile—where did you get it?"

The room tensed, every gaze sharpening on Edith's swollen, tear-streaked face.

Chasel strode forward, his expression icy. "As a doctor, I know these reports are confidential. No ethical physician would disclose them. So tell me, Ms. Fairhaven—did you bribe someone?"

Cassius nodded in silent agreement, his jaw tight.

Edith's panic spiked at the mention of evidence and witnesses. "It wasn't a doctor! It had nothing to do with any doctor!"

"Then where did it come from?" Jareth demanded.

Edith's fists clenched, her eyes darting wildly as she struggled to form a response.

Jareth scoffed, tearing off his tie in disgust. "Guards. Take her to the police. If she won't talk, they'll make her."

As the guards seized her, Edith shrieked, thrashing in their grip. "Grandpa Barry! Save me!"

But Barry stood frozen. What could he do? His granddaughter had dragged their family's name through the mud. Intervening now would only bury them deeper.

The scandal had shattered the evening. The Ashbournes left without another word, Emeric bundling Evadne into the car before Thaddeus could speak.

Cassius lingered in the parking lot, his fingers trembling as he pulled out the crumpled medical report. The words blurred as tears welled in his eyes.

Footsteps approached.

Thaddeus stood before him, his gaze hollow, the fire in his eyes extinguished.
###Chapter 481

"President Ashbourne."

Thaddeus's voice was hoarse, as if gravel had been dragged through his throat. Barely audible.

"Thaddeus!"

Cassius's eyes were bloodshot, his chest heaving with fury. He charged at Thaddeus like a wild beast, his fist clenched tight.

Thaddeus saw the blow coming—aimed straight at his face. But he didn’t flinch. He deserved it. Even if Cassius beat him to death, he wouldn’t resist.

"Cassius! Stop!"

Just as Cassius’s fist was about to connect, Chasel appeared, wrapping his arms around Cassius from behind in a desperate hold.

"Let go," Cassius hissed, his lips trembling, his heart shattering.

"No!"

Chasel’s arms shook as he clung to Cassius’s waist, breathless. "Hitting him won’t change anything! Will it bring back what Evadne lost?"

"But he deserves to die!"

Cassius’s face twisted with rage, his powerful frame straining against Chasel’s grip. Tears he’d been holding back finally spilled over. "Why doesn’t he just die? My sister can’t have children anymore! She’s only twenty-five, and she’s lost that forever! Because of you, Thaddeus! Why don’t you just die?!"

Why didn’t he die?

He should.

Thaddeus stood there, hollow, like a puppet with its strings cut. His face was ashen, his spirit broken.

Chasel took in his wretched state. Thaddeus’s short hair was soaked, rainwater dripping down his once-handsome face. His tailored suit clung to him, mud caking his shoes and trousers.

It had started raining when Evadne was taken away. Thaddeus had chased the Ashbourne car through the downpour for miles—but he never caught even a glimpse of her.

"I’m sorry," he whispered, over and over, like a broken record. "It’s all my fault. All of it."

"Thaddeus, do you have any idea how much Evadne wanted children?" Cassius’s voice cracked, his towering frame shaking with grief. "She told us so many times—she wanted a baby with you. And when she remembered how you treated her during those three years, she’d call me in the middle of the night, crying."

Thaddeus felt like a knife had been plunged into his heart, twisting deeper with every word.

Tears welled in his eyes, his shoulders trembling violently. The pain was unbearable.

"I didn’t know," he choked out, his lips pale. "If I had—"

"You didn’t know?" Cassius let out a bitter, humorless laugh. "You didn’t know about your one-night stand with Evadne? You didn’t know she was pregnant? Are you joking, or are you really that clueless? Either way, I can’t forgive you. If I let Evadne stay with someone like you, I wouldn’t deserve to call myself a man!"

Chasel sighed, helpless. He’d seen firsthand how much Thaddeus loved Evadne.

But those three years of neglect had scarred her too deeply.

If he were in her place, even if he still loved the man, the daily reminder of her infertility would be torture.

A love doomed from the start.

"Cassius," Chasel pleaded, "no matter what, Thaddeus saved Evadne’s life—and yours. If it weren’t for him, you wouldn’t be standing here. Think about that before you do something you’ll regret."

Cassius’s fist slowly lowered, his rage simmering beneath the surface.

"Thaddeus, you saved my life, so I’ll spare you. But from now on, stay away from me—and stay away from Evadne. I can forgive everything else, but not this. Never this."

With that, Cassius turned and walked away. Chasel gave Thaddeus one last glance before following.

"Please," Thaddeus begged, tears streaming down his face. "Give me one chance to make it right. Just one!"

Cassius stopped, his voice icy. "Bring me back a sister with a healthy body, a womb that wasn’t ruined. Then we’ll talk."

Thaddeus didn’t remember how he left the parking lot.

His head throbbed, a buzzing noise filling his ears like demons laughing at his misery.

"Thad!"

Jareth’s voice finally broke through the haze. Thaddeus swayed, the world spinning around him.

Jareth caught him just before he collapsed into a puddle. "Hang in there! You can’t give up on Evadne!"

Thaddeus’s face was a mask of despair. "Her body is ruined because of me. What do I do, Jareth? How do I fix this?"

"There’s always a way," Jareth insisted. "Medicine is advancing every day. We’ll find a solution. But if you give up now, it’s over."

Thaddeus clutched his head, gasping. "I told her I wanted kids. I wanted a family with her. If I’d known—if I’d known it would come to this, I never would’ve said a word!"

Jareth’s heart ached.

Evadne had already carried so much guilt. Every time Thaddeus mentioned children, it must have been like salt in the wound.

"Thad, we need to find out exactly what happened back then. Only then can we fix this."

Thaddeus forced himself to think.

The medical reports said Evadne had been two months pregnant when she lost the baby. What had happened two months after they were together?

"Mr. Abernathy!"

Gordon rushed over, drenched from the rain. "Mr. Hamilton is demanding you return to Havenbrook immediately. He knows what happened at the banquet."

The news of Evadne’s infertility had spread like wildfire.

Though no recordings had leaked—thanks to the Ashbournes and Fairhavens’ influence—the damage was done.

Hamilton had nearly collapsed when he heard.

"My poor girl," he sobbed, clutching his chest. "How could this happen? She was carrying our family’s child!"

Mr. Murray stood by, guilt gnawing at him. He’d kept Evadne’s secret all these years.

Frederic scoffed. "Dad, don’t blame Thaddeus. He didn’t love her back then. And Evadne was careless—she didn’t even know she was pregnant."

Thaddeus’s blood boiled.

Before he could speak, Hamilton hurled a teacup at Frederic’s head.

"Damn you!" Hamilton roared. "How dare you blame her? She’s suffered enough!"

Frederic staggered back, blood trickling from his forehead.

"Before, I thought Elspeth corrupted you," Hamilton spat. "But now I see—you’re just as heartless as she is!"
###Chapter 482

Frederic had lived his entire life in luxury and privilege, never once experiencing such brutal humiliation. And to have it happen in front of his own son? His pride was shattered beyond repair. The disgrace was unbearable.

"You ungrateful brat! I'll beat some sense into you!"

Hamilton raised the porcelain cup again, ready to hurl it, but Mr. Murray intervened just in time. "Mr. Hamilton Abernathy! Please, calm down!"

Frederic clutched his bleeding forehead, teeth gritted in fury. "You choose Emeric's daughter over your own flesh and blood? You've betrayed your family! That woman and her father have been nothing but trouble for the Abernathy Group. They stole the Equestrian Hotel project right from under us at the banquet! If not for them, it would've been ours!"

His rage wasn't satisfied yet. He turned sharply, jabbing a finger at Thaddeus. "And you! Instead of supporting your own family, you helped the Ashbournes strike a deal with William and his son! Your brother, sick and abroad, still does more for this family than you! For the sake of a woman, you'd hand over our interests on a silver platter? As CEO, this is gross negligence! You will take full responsibility for this failure!"

Thaddeus's eyes darkened like extinguished stars, his voice rough. "Is that all I'm responsible for?"

Frederic stiffened. "What?"

"I publicly opposed your plan to ally with the Fairhaven Group through marriage. Or have you forgotten in just one night?"

His icy gaze was terrifying. "Didn't you say if I refused to marry Edith, I should leave the Abernathy Group? Now that the Fairhaven Group is in chaos, and Edith's schemes are exposed—revealing Evadne's miscarriage to the world, showing her true colors—you're suddenly silent about the alliance? Afraid of the backlash?"

Mr. Murray trembled, his back drenched in cold sweat.

How was this possible? Evadne's miscarriage had been a closely guarded secret. How did Edith know?

"Thaddeus!" Frederic was livid, his son's words pushing him toward a stroke.

"An alliance? With that vile Fairhaven girl?"

Hamilton's grip on the cup tightened, his entire body shaking with rage. "Frederic! Have you lost your mind? You'd discard a loyal woman like Evadne for that scheming brat? She revealed the miscarriage to drive them apart! And you want Thaddeus to marry her? Why don't you marry her yourself!"

"Dad!"

"Your judgment is clouded, and that's your disgrace. But don't drag my grandson down with you!"

The old man's eyes burned with fury, sharp despite his age. "And don't you dare blame the loss of that project on Thaddeus or slander Evadne! I wasn't at the race, but I know exactly what happened. The Ashbournes' horse was sabotaged by the Fairhavens, yet Evadne still won first place! She earned that opportunity through her own skill, not something you can tarnish with lies!"

"Grandpa." Thaddeus's voice cracked, tears welling in his eyes.

His grandfather still trusted and supported Evadne, just as he had three years ago.

But what had he done?

His grandfather had always urged him to cherish Evadne, told him repeatedly she was rare, not to let her slip away. And what had he done?

He'd ruined everything.

"The only woman I'll accept as Thaddeus's wife is Evadne. No one else!" Hamilton declared, unwavering. "Thaddeus owes her. The Abernathy family owes her. When I'm gone, I can't control what happens. But as long as I live, Frederic, you will not pair him with some unsuitable woman!"

Humiliated and enraged, Frederic roared, his forehead swollen grotesquely. "Chad's health is fragile, on medication year-round. The doctors say he can't father children! And you want Thaddeus to marry Evadne, who can't conceive? Do you want the Abernathy line to end? Our company to have no heir?"

Hamilton paled. "What?"

"Evadne can't have children after that miscarriage! Is that the woman you want for Thaddeus? He's our only hope to continue the Abernathy legacy, and you'd have him marry her? Who will inherit our fortune then? Glynnis? Mari? Are they even capable?"

Thaddeus felt his heart being torn apart again.

"How could this be?" Hamilton was stunned, his heart bleeding.

"Her problem shouldn't doom our entire family! It's her bad luck, her fate!"

"That's not true!"

Suddenly, Mr. Murray, drenched in sweat, stepped forward, shouting hoarsely. "It's not like that!"

The three Abernathy men froze.

Mr. Murray had served the family for over thirty years, known for his calm and meticulous nature. This outburst was unheard of.

"Murray, do you know something?" Thaddeus's sharp intuition kicked in, his eyes reddening. "You know something, don't you?"

Mr. Murray shut his eyes, guilt-ridden tears streaming down. Then, to everyone's shock, he dropped to his knees.

"Murray!"

"Mr. Murray!"

Hamilton, alarmed, slapped his thigh. "Get up! If you have something to say, say it! What's this nonsense?"

Thaddeus moved to help him up, but Mr. Murray refused.

"It's all my fault. I should've spoken sooner. If I had, Ms. Ashbourne and Mr. Thaddeus wouldn't be in this mess."

His voice broke. "I was there when Ms. Ashbourne lost the child."

Thaddeus's pupils shook violently. "What?"

"Mr. Murray! What happened? How were you there?" Hamilton demanded, voice burning with urgency.

"The accident. It was because of the accident."

"Mrs. Abernathy, I'm sorry. I can't keep this secret for you any longer."

"The accident?" Thaddeus's mind raced.

Nearly three years ago, when he'd returned from abroad, his grandfather had been hospitalized after an accident. Evadne hadn't been by his side, claiming family matters. She'd disappeared for a while.

"Christmas. Was it that Christmas?" Hamilton realized instantly.

Mr. Murray nodded heavily. "Three years ago, on Christmas, you were all away from Elmsworth. Only Ms. Ashbourne braved the snowstorm to keep you company."

Thaddeus's chest tightened, the air thinning around him.

"You wanted to visit Mrs. Fiona Abernathy's grave, so she drove you. Later, you went to the beach where you and Mrs. Fiona used to go. On the way back, there was an accident."

Mr. Murray lowered his head, tears falling. "Ms. Ashbourne was injured too. After getting you to the hospital, she started having severe abdominal pain. Then... I saw blood under her skirt."

"My poor Evadne! Why were you so foolish?" Hamilton lamented, shaking his head, tears in his eyes.

Thaddeus gripped his shirt, feeling a dull knife grinding his heart to pulp.

Even Frederic, usually cold, furrowed his brow slightly.

"Ms. Ashbourne begged me to keep it secret, afraid of worrying you and Mr. Thaddeus. I thought of your injuries and didn't want to shock you. And I feared how her infertility would affect her standing in the Abernathy family. It would ruin her life."

"And you listened to her? You weren't thinking straight! She was just a girl—what did she know?" Hamilton reproached, heartbroken.

"It's all my fault. Punish me however you see fit."

Before he could finish, Thaddeus, consumed by cold fury, stormed out of the mansion.

"Mr. Thaddeus!"

Mr. Murray tried to follow, but Hamilton stopped him. "Let him go! This is his debt to repay. My old bones can't make it right. Let him spend his life atoning."

Outside, torrential rain poured as camera flashes bombarded Edith's pale, horrified face, brighter than lightning.

"Ms. Fairhaven! Exposing Ms. Ashbourne's infertility is a gross violation of privacy! Have you no shame?"

"Did you bribe a doctor for that medical report, or was it given to you?"

"Are you trying to sabotage their relationship to secure a marriage for yourself?"

Reporters swarmed the police station entrance, descending on Edith like vultures.

Soaked and disheveled, handcuffs hidden under white cloth, she looked utterly pitiful. Just hours ago, she'd been a proud heiress. Now, she was a prisoner.

Her dreams of becoming a CEO's wife were over.

Jareth had ordered no PR help or legal counsel, abandoning her completely.

Her grandfather had tried to control the narrative online, but how were there still so many reporters? Why?

"That fool probably can't comprehend how this happened."

Harvey stood beside Avery, both watching the news of Edith's arrest on a large screen. With a mocking smirk, Harvey said, "From the moment you invited her into the game, it was checkmate. But she's useless. Couldn't handle Thaddeus at the hotel event, and now she's tangled in her own mess. Jareth's cut her loose, leaving only Barry to clean up. But even he can't outsmart you. Sending those reporters was the final push into the abyss."

Avery swirled his wine glass, a satisfied smile playing on his lips. His golden-rimmed glasses hid predatory eyes, gleaming with cruel amusement.

"Useless pawns should be discarded like trash. And trash belongs in the dustbin."

He took a sip, his smile widening as Edith was dragged away like a stray dog. "But she wasn't entirely worthless. Without her, this wouldn't have blown up so spectacularly. Better than I expected."

"You were wise to stay low tonight. With all that chaos, it was the right move."

"But now, it's time to step out."

Avery rose gracefully, Harvey straightening his jacket and tie. "Now that the eyesore is gone, it's time for the real lead to take the stage."
###Chapter 483

Silveke Harbor blazed with lights, the town restless with tension.

Emeric, the passionate collector, shattered priceless porcelain vases in his fury. Millions reduced to shards in seconds.

The maids stood frozen. Myra clutched Suri's hand, panic-stricken. Aviana's heart churned with turmoil.

"So you all knew."

Emeric trembled, veins bulging with rage. "You hid it from me for three years—three damn years?!"

"Emeric, we kept it from you to spare you the pain," Suri said softly, her voice steady but low. "Your health hasn't been strong. The shock would have destroyed you."

Emeric staggered, then laughed bitterly, jabbing a finger at them. "You call this kindness? Letting Evadne suffer in silence while her honor was ruined? This is how you protect me?!"

"Emeric! That's not what Suri meant!" Myra cried, tears welling.

But he cut her off with a sneer. "Of course you'd defend her. You're not Evadne's birth mother—how could you truly care? All those years pretending to be a happy family—was it all just an act?"

"Emeric! How dare you!" Aviana stepped forward, eyes blazing, but Suri held her back.

"I've stood by you for twenty years," Aviana hissed, her voice cracking. "Do you think we don't ache for Evadne? When she lost the baby, when Thaddeus abandoned her—do you think we didn't bleed for her too?"

Emeric's breath hitched.

Suri had knelt before the Bright family—prideful, untouchable Suri—begging for Evadne's treatment. The thought twisted like a knife in his chest.

"We had no choice," Myra whispered, tears spilling. "What good would anger do now? Nothing can undo what's been lost."

"It can be undone!"

Arnold stormed in, eyes bloodshot, Cassius close behind. "I'll resign. I'll take Evadne to every specialist in the world. I refuse to believe she can't be healed!"

"Arnold, don't throw your career away!" Cassius gripped his shoulders.

"But Evadne—"

"We'll find a way. Debby has connections overseas. There has to be hope." Cassius's voice wavered.

Arnold paced, frantic. "Then I'll kill Thaddeus myself!"

"Enough!"

Evadne's voice cut through the room. She stood on the stairs, pale as death, her usual fire extinguished.

"Three years. It's been three years. I don't care anymore. Stop dragging it up!" Her eyes burned with fury. "Since when does a woman need children? I never wanted them! Leave Thaddeus out of this—it wasn't his fault!"

"Lyle!" Emeric roared. "I told you to keep her in her room!"

"I want to see Thaddeus!"

"Over my dead body!"

They glared at each other, father and daughter, locked in a battle of wills.

Evadne laughed hollowly. "You've had your affairs. All I ever wanted was him. And you still won't let me have that?"

"Evadne—" Cassius's heart ached.

"Are you not afraid of burying your own child?"

Gasps filled the room.

"Evadne, don't!" Arnold blurted. "That bastard isn't worth it!"

Emeric's jaw clenched. "You think threats scare me? If you wanted to die, you had chances—when you lost the baby, when he left you. You won't do it now."

She nearly shattered her teeth from grinding them.

He knew her too well.

"Fine. But mark my words—my time is short. And you won't outlive me."

"Dad, stop!" Cassius pleaded.

Emeric's voice turned icy. "She'd betray her family for that man. Why should I care?"

Evadne was dragged away, locked in her room, cut off from the world.

The Ashbourne men seethed. If not for Cassius and Arnold's intervention, Thaddeus would have been hunted down.

Exhausted, Emeric leaned on his sons as they helped him upstairs.

"Defend him, and you're dead to me," he growled.

Arnold scoffed. "Defend him? I'm not the one with a decade-old blood clot."

Cassius's expression darkened. "I have no intention of defending him."

"Good."

A thunderclap split the sky.

Emeric glared out the window. "If there's any justice, lightning will strike that bastard dead."

Cassius and Arnold exchanged a glance.

"Chairman Ashbourne!" Dn rushed in, breathless. "Thaddeus Abernathy is at the gates!"

The storm raged harder in Skyrim than in Elmsworth. Thaddeus stood before Silveke Harbor's gates, drenched, his phone dead from countless unanswered calls.

Despair gnawed at him. Would he never see her again?

Then—bootsteps.

He looked up.

A gun barrel pressed between his eyes.

"Thaddeus," Bet snarled, rainwater dripping from his cap. "You ruined her. Your life is forfeit."

Thaddeus didn't flinch. Death meant nothing. Only the thought of never holding Evadne again terrified him.

"Bet!" Cassius's voice cut through the rain. "What the hell are you doing?!"
###Chapter 484

Cassius's face twisted with fury as he lunged forward, disarming Bet with a single, fluid motion.

Colonel Bet was renowned for his combat skills—disarming him was considered impossible.

But Cassius had covered the gun's muzzle with his own hand. Bet feared an accidental shot that might harm his brother and had no choice but to relent.

"Cassius, if you truly cared about our sister, you wouldn't stop me!" Bet's eyes burned with rage, his glare sharp enough to cut through Thaddeus like a blade.

The accusation stung, especially coming from the usually composed Mr. Waverley. Yet Cassius felt no resentment.

If this rage could be vented now, perhaps it was for the best. Better than his brothers doing something irreversible.

"Bet, I care about Evadne. But I care about you too. And Arnold. And Elvis. We grew up together—do you think I don't care for any of you? I just don’t want you throwing your lives away over scum like him. You might feel justified, but have you thought about Evadne? About our parents?"

At the mention of their mother, the brothers' eyes glistened with sorrow.

"You finally came home after so long. We all missed you. Evadne was overjoyed to see you."

Cassius closed his eyes, swallowing the ache in his chest. "Let it go. Evadne has moved on. The person involved doesn’t want to dwell on it. Why force her to relive the pain?"

The pain of losing her child.

Thaddeus gasped for breath, tears welling in his bloodshot eyes, washed away by the cold rain.

His and Evadne’s child—had he lived, he would be three years old now.

What had he done?

What had he done?

"The rain won't stop, and you're already exhausted from traveling. You'll get sick. Go home." Cassius grabbed Bet's stiff arm and pulled him toward the door.

"President Ashbourne."

Thaddeus's voice was ragged, his broad shoulders slumped. "Please. Let me see Evadne one more time."

"In your dreams!"

Bet erupted, fighting against Cassius's grip. "Thaddeus! Get the hell out of here! Don’t you dare step foot near the Ashbourne estate again! If I see you one more time, I swear I’ll kill you!"

"President Ashbourne. I need to see her."

Thaddeus stood firm, agony in his eyes but resolve unshaken. "The past. Our child. So many things—I need to hear it from her. Face to face."

"Thaddeus, Evadne said it’s over. It’s in the past."

Cassius's voice was rough, his gaze dark. "All of you—stop clinging to old wounds. Move forward. Go home. Don’t come back."

As the brothers turned to leave, they froze.

"Dad?"

Emeric stepped forward, pale-faced, moving through the downpour toward Thaddeus.

The air thickened, the chill from the Ashbourne patriarch so intense it could freeze the rain mid-fall.

Thaddeus watched him approach, lips parting—but no words came.

Then—

A sharp crack echoed as Emeric's fist connected with Thaddeus's face.

"Dad?!"

"Dad!"

The Ashbourne brothers were stunned.

In thirty years, they had never seen their father strike anyone outside the family. Proud, untouchable—Emeric Ashbourne never dirtied his own hands.

But today, he was beyond furious.

Not satisfied with one blow, Emeric struck again. And again.

Thaddeus's face swelled, blood dripping from his lips—but he felt nothing. Only the numb, crushing weight of guilt.

"Dad! Your health! You can't—"

Cassius and Arnold tried to restrain him, but Emeric shoved them aside, gripping Thaddeus's collar.

"Do you understand? The woman you trampled on—the one you hurt over and over—she is my life. The last piece of the woman I loved most in this world. She is everything to me!"

"Chairman Ashbourne, I'm sorry."

Thaddeus's voice was hollow. "Give me another chance. Let me make it right."

"If you couldn’t commit, why marry her? And if you married her, why break her?"

Emeric shoved him back, his own strength faltering. "Go back to Elmsworth. Back to your wretched family. From this moment, K Group is Abernathy Group’s sworn enemy. If you have any pride left, defend what’s yours. Otherwise, I will tear it down myself. Get out!"

The Ashbourne men left, the door slamming shut behind them.

Thaddeus stood in the rain, hollow.

An uncrossable chasm now lay between him and the Ashbournes.

Slowly, his knees buckled.

He collapsed into the puddle, shoulders shaking with silent sobs.

Footsteps approached.

A polished shoe stopped beside him.

"Need an umbrella, Mr. Thaddeus Abernathy?"

Avery’s mocking voice dripped with disdain as he looked down at Thaddeus like a stray dog.

Thaddeus's fingers curled into fists, veins bulging.

"Looks like you don’t."

Avery smirked. "Given the unforgivable sin you committed against Evadne, do you really think groveling will change anything? Pathetic."

Harvey, holding Avery’s umbrella, chuckled. "Honestly, if you hadn’t said it, I wouldn’t have recognized this as Mr. Abernathy’s grand display of remorse. More like a loyal hound begging for scraps."

Thaddeus had no fight left.

Perhaps this torment was his penance.

Only by destroying himself could he bear the guilt.

"It’s late, Mr. Abernathy. Aren’t you going home? If not, I’ll be heading inside."

Avery’s smile was ice. "I know it’s hard being the man everyone kicks when he’s down. But you brought this on yourself. Had you treated Evadne better, you wouldn’t be here. Kneel as long as you like. Savor the pain."

As they turned toward the gates, Thaddeus spoke, voice raw.

"Was it you?"

Avery paused.

"Did you use Edith to expose Evadne’s past? To tear us apart? To get revenge on me?" Thaddeus's eyes burned. "You call this love? Reopening her wounds just to hurt me?"

Avery’s laugh was cold. "What nonsense are you spouting? You ruined Evadne. Not me. Maybe the rain’s addled your brain. Stop clinging to her. Let her go."

The storm had passed.

Elvis stood on the rooftop, trench coat billowing in the wind. A pack of cigarettes lay empty beside him, but his nerves still thrummed.

"Elvis, are you in Skyrim yet?" Bet’s worried voice crackled through the phone. "Flying alone—any trouble?"

"No, Bet." Elvis tightened his grip on the phone.

A pause. Then, quietly: "Elvis… don’t do anything reckless. If anyone’s going to be the villain, let it be me."

Elvis exhaled smoke, his smirk bitter. "Bet, if I wanted to do something reckless, you couldn’t stop me."

His dark eyes flickered. "Take care of Evadne. I’ll see her later."

Elvis hadn’t returned to Skyrim for two reasons.

First—he couldn’t face Evadne, not after what he’d learned.

Second—before the banquet ended, she’d sent him a message:

[Find the woman who looks like me. She’s the key to exposing the mastermind. For me. For Thaddeus. For all of us.]

Alone in the lounge, Elvis stared at his phone wallpaper—a photo of him and Evadne.

Above him, unnoticed, a camera swiveled.

At Velvet Haven, deep underground, Avery’s surveillance hub hummed with activity. Hundreds of screens tracked Elmsworth’s elite.

"Ms. Archer! Your target has appeared!"

Elsie’s pulse spiked as she turned to the screen.

There—Elvis, staring at his phone.

At her face.

No.

At Evadne’s face.

The beloved Ashbourne heiress.

Elsie’s gaze turned glacial, a slow, dangerous smile curling her lips.

"Keep watching him. I’m on my way."
###Chapter 485

Some were drowning in misfortune, while others rode the waves of triumph.

Avery performed his act of concern with practiced ease, pacing the Ashbourne living room with feigned distress. His posture was rigid, his expression grave, the perfect picture of a worried suitor.

"Damn it," Arnold muttered under his breath, gripping the banister so hard his knuckles turned white. "First, we had to deal with that traitor Thaddeus, and now this snake Avery slithers his way to our doorstep. What kind of cosmic debt did our little sister rack up in a past life? Did she betray an entire kingdom or something?"

Beside him, Cassius watched with cold detachment, his sharp gaze locked onto Avery’s theatrics. The veins in his hand stood out as he clenched the railing, barely containing his disgust.

"At the grand dinner tonight, where he should’ve been representing the Chambers Group, he was conveniently absent. But the second Evadne faces trouble, he rushes over like some knight in shining armor." Cassius’s voice dripped with disdain. "With my years in prosecution, I’d bet my entire career that tonight’s mess has Avery’s fingerprints all over it. He probably orchestrated it with Edith, using that wretched girl as his pawn."

Arnold scoffed. "Spot on. But he’s too clever to leave evidence. He always has an exit strategy before he even makes his move."

Cassius’s lips curled into a humorless smirk. "Exactly. He wouldn’t be here tonight if he hadn’t already covered his tracks. He thinks he’s untouchable."

"Son of a bitch," Arnold growled. "Every time he shows up, it’s never for anything good."

Just then, Emeric approached Avery, flanked by Myra and Dan.

"Mr. Chambers, Mrs. Chambers," Avery greeted with a respectful bow, the very image of the perfect gentleman.

"Mr. Ashbourne," Myra interjected before Emeric could speak, her tone firm. "Our daughter isn’t feeling well and isn’t receiving visitors. Given tonight’s events, we’re not in the mood for company. Please, see yourself out."

Avery’s eyes darkened at the dismissal, his fingers twitching with suppressed frustration. Yet, he maintained his composure. "I heard about Evadne’s condition and couldn’t rest. I came to offer my help. If the local doctors are at a loss, I can arrange for specialists from Helgen to consult on her case."

"Avery." Emeric’s voice was heavy, his gaze unwavering. "We appreciate your concern. But you’re Nydia’s fiancé now. Whatever history you share with Evadne, it’s time to focus on your future with Nydia. Keep your distance."

Avery’s face paled.

Arnold couldn’t help but smirk. "After all his scheming, he still doesn’t get to have her. Outsmarted by his own game."

Avery’s jaw clenched. "Mr. Ashbourne, the only woman I’ve ever wanted to marry is Evadne! I never intended to marry anyone else!"

Myra stiffened, lips pressed tightly together.

Emeric’s brows furrowed. "What are you saying? My daughters aren’t commodities for you to pick and choose from. The alliance was agreed upon with Nydia, and it will remain so. Don’t bring up Evadne again."

Avery’s eyes burned with intensity. "You know how I feel about her. It’s undeniable. I never had a choice in this arrangement—I only conceded because I thought she was happy. But do you honestly believe Thaddeus is the right man for her now?"

Emeric’s breath hitched, the memory of his daughter’s pain flashing before his eyes.

"Before, I failed to protect her. But from now on, I won’t let anyone hurt her again." Avery’s voice cracked with emotion. "Please, let me marry Evadne. I swear, I’ll never let her suffer like this again."

"Dream on," Cassius cut in coldly as he descended the stairs with Arnold. "Fantasy is the only place you’ll ever have her."

Avery’s expression twisted with barely concealed fury.

"Dad, don’t fall for his act," Arnold snapped. "Who knows if he colluded with Edith tonight? He’s probably here to swoop in while Evadne’s vulnerable!"

Emeric and Myra exchanged uneasy glances.

Avery adjusted his glasses, feigning hurt. "Arnold, I know you dislike me, but that doesn’t give you the right to slander my character. Edith and I have no connection beyond that one incident at the races. I won’t tolerate baseless accusations."

Arnold nearly lunged forward, but Cassius held him back with a firm grip.

"Mr. Chambers," Cassius said smoothly, "you think you can marry Evadne? Not a chance. And your brother Byron, dreaming of making Nydia his bride? Forget it."

The room fell silent.

Then, the butler rushed in, breathless. "Chairman Ashbourne! Mr. Jeff Chambers is here!"

Emeric frowned. "Jeff? At this hour?"

Jeff stormed in, his face red with rage, his eldest son Matthew at his side. "Cassius! What the hell did you do to my son? How dare you treat Byron like this?!"

Cassius’s expression remained icy.

Emeric was baffled. "Cassius, what’s going on?"

Jeff’s voice shook with fury. "Your son had Byron arrested! He’s pressing rape charges against him!"

Rape charges? The word sent a shockwave through the room.

Avery’s lips thinned. So, Byron’s plan had backfired spectacularly.

Jeff pointed an accusing finger. "If you didn’t want this union, you could’ve just said so! Using underhanded tactics—is this how the Ashbournes operate?!"

Aviana stepped forward, her eyes blazing. "Who are you calling underhanded? If Byron’s in jail, it’s because he did something wrong! Maybe you should focus on getting him a good lawyer instead of blaming us!"

Jeff’s face twisted with fury.

Emeric turned to Cassius. "Explain. Now."

Before Cassius could respond, a voice cut through the tension.

"Expecting my brother to fetch that beast from jail? Dream on."

All eyes turned to the grand staircase.

Evadne descended, her presence commanding, her gaze sharp as a blade. Behind her stood Bet, silent and lethal, his protective aura unmistakable.

Avery’s jealousy flared.

Evadne’s lips curled into a chilling smile. "Mr. Jeff Chambers, when you visited Byron, did he conveniently leave out the part where I shattered his tailbone, broke his fingers, and knocked out his teeth?"

The room froze.

She tilted her head. "I even considered castrating him. But then I realized—why bother? He’ll be impotent for the rest of his life anyway."

Silence.

Then—

Chaos erupted.
###Chapter 486

The air in the Ashbourne mansion was thick with tension.

Jefferson and Marcus stood frozen, their faces mirroring identical expressions of shock.

"Evangeline, how could you?" Cassian's voice cracked as he stared at his younger sister, his heart twisting in agony.

As the eldest, he should have been the one to shield his siblings from this storm. He had planned to bear the brunt alone, to resolve everything quietly. But Evangeline had charged forward, her words like daggers aimed straight at the Chambers family.

"Impotent? Evangeline, what the hell are you implying?"

Marcus's aristocratic composure shattered. His face darkened with fury as he spat, "And you struck Byron? You actually laid hands on a Chambers? Who do you think you are?"

"Who do I think I am?" Evangeline's lips curled into a cold smirk. "Someone who doesn't tolerate cowards preying on the weak. He deserved worse than a beating. A man like Byron belongs behind bars, rotting with the filth he is."

The Ashbournes tensed. Myra swayed on her feet, her vision blurring.

"Nadia... Nadia!"

Myra clutched her chest, struggling to breathe.

"Myra!"

"Darling!"

Emeric caught her before she collapsed, his own pulse racing. "Stay with me. Don't panic. I'm here."

"I'm terrified, Emeric," Myra sobbed. "What if something happened to our girl?"

"Evangeline! How dare you say such things!"

Jefferson, still in denial, bristled defensively. "Byron is a gentleman! Your father and I have been friends for decades. He would never harm Nadia!"

"A gentleman?" Evangeline scoffed, her sharp gaze sweeping over the Chambers men before landing on Alistair. "Your family breeds nothing but disgrace. The men are predators, the women conniving fools. How disappointing."

Jefferson and Marcus turned ashen.

Alistair's fingers dug into his palms, the sting of her words sharper than any slap.

"Evangeline, Cassian," Emeric's voice was unsteady, "are you saying Byron assaulted Nadia?"

Cassian stepped forward, his jaw tight. "At the dinner, Byron drugged her and took her upstairs. He tried to—"

"What?!"

Emeric's vision swam with rage.

"We stopped him in time," Cassian said quickly. "Nadia is safe, but the trauma... it'll take her a while to recover."

"So Byron attempted to assault her but failed?" Emeric's hands trembled.

Evangeline nodded. "Yes. And thanks to his... condition, he couldn't complete the act."

She considered mentioning Thaddeus's role but held back. Now wasn't the time to drag him into this mess.

"Thank God," Emeric muttered, relief and fury warring within him.

"Impotent? My son is not—!" Jefferson's face purpled with rage.

"Cursing him?" Emeric's bitter laugh was laced with venom. "After what he did to my daughter, death would be mercy. If he weren't your son, Jefferson, I'd have ended him myself!"

The Chambers men recoiled. They had come demanding justice, only to be humiliated.

Alistair's lips bled where he'd bitten them. This disaster wasn't just about Byron—it threatened to sever ties between their families. And worse, it stood between him and Evangeline.

"Why?" Myra's voice broke.

She turned on Jefferson, her eyes burning. "Because Nadia is my daughter? Because she's weak like me, she's fair game?"

"Myra, don't say that!"

Suri rushed to embrace her. "Nadia is our princess, just as precious as Evangeline or Deborah!"

A soft voice cut through the tension. "Mom... don't cry."

They turned. Nadia stood at the top of the stairs, her face tear-streaked, her slender frame wrapped in a blanket.

"Nadia!"

Myra sprinted to her, pulling her into a desperate hug. "I'm so sorry. I failed you."

"I'm okay, Mom," Nadia whispered, soothing her mother despite her own shattered state.

Evangeline watched, her heart aching. If only her sister had even an ounce of her defiance, maybe this could have been avoided.

"Lies! Byron would never do this!" Marcus jabbed a finger at Evangeline and Cassian. "You set him up to sabotage our alliance!"

"Shut your mouth!"

Aaron stormed in, his expression thunderous. "Still playing the fool? Pathetic."

Behind him stood Julian.

"Julian..." Nadia's tears fell silently.

Julian's throat tightened. So close, yet an ocean between them.

"Chairman Ashbourne," Marcus sneered, "gathering your whole family to ambush us? Even if you're powerful, the Chambers aren't pushovers. Making enemies isn't wise."

Evangeline's fists clenched. She'd make him regret those words.

"Marcus, you're naive," Emeric said coldly. "Ask your father what happens to those who cross me."

Marcus paled but held his ground.

"I'm here as an officer." Aaron slapped an arrest warrant on the table. "Byron is being charged with attempted assault. Evidence is ironclad. Prepare for his trial."

Jefferson's face drained of color. This was real.

"Let's go," Jefferson muttered, grabbing Marcus. "We need to save Byron."

As they turned to leave, Emeric's voice rang out. "The engagement is off. And I will see justice served for what was done to my daughter!"

Jefferson shot Alistair a glare. "Alistair! We're leaving!"

Alistair hesitated, but the Ashbournes' icy stares left no room for argument.

His lingering glance at Evangeline made her stomach churn. But relief washed over her—the unwanted union was finally dead.

In the Chambers' Bentley, the atmosphere was glacial.

Marcus handed Jefferson his blood pressure medication. "Byron, that idiot! Of all women, why her?"

Alistair adjusted his glasses, his voice dark. "Already castrated and still hunting? He paid the price for his greed."

"Enough!" Jefferson snapped. "Alistair, you're to cut all ties with Evangeline. No more groveling to the Ashbournes!"

"Why should I suffer for Byron's mistakes?" Alistair's eyes gleamed with stubborn determination. "Marrying Evangeline would benefit us all."

Marcus laughed mockingly. "Delusional. Even if Thaddeus vanished tomorrow, she'd never choose you."

"There's always a way."

"Focus!" Jefferson barked. "Byron's situation is dire. We need to get him out of this!"
###Chapter 487

The crimson sports car screeched to a halt outside the neon-lit nightclub, its tires leaving streaks of burnt rubber on the asphalt.

Isabella Sinclair stepped out, her toned legs unfolding gracefully from the low-slung vehicle. The moonlight glinted off her crystal-studded stilettos, their sharp heels like weapons poised to strike. Her form-fitting mermaid gown clung to every curve, a silent declaration of lethal elegance.

"Ms. Sinclair. He's still inside. I've been watching him." A subordinate emerged from the shadows, voice hushed.

With a cold, calculated gaze, Isabella twisted her raven-black hair into an effortless updo, securing it with a silver hairpin adorned with a blood-red ruby. The motion was fluid, hypnotic—her subordinate barely blinked.

"Stay alert. Be ready to clean up."

Inside, the nightclub pulsed with shadows and strobe lights, a symphony of chaos.

Isabella clenched her jaw, weaving through the drunken crowd until her eyes locked onto her target—Alexander Kingsley, seated at the far end of the bar. Every step closer sent her heartbeat into overdrive, the noise around her fading into white noise.

She adjusted her hair, fingers brushing the hidden weapon. Just a little closer—

Then, pain exploded in her wrist.

The world spun.

Her back slammed against a table, the impact knocking the air from her lungs.

Alexander's reflexes were inhuman. His rough grip imprisoned her wrist, his other hand crushing her throat, tightening with terrifying precision.

Years as a top-tier agent had honed his instincts to razor sharpness. Even the faintest whisper of danger triggered him.

Now, pinned beneath him, Isabella gasped for air, tears welling in her eyes.

Recognition flickered in Alexander's gaze.

He loosened his grip.

Isabella coughed, tears streaking her flushed cheeks. Around them, whispers rose—some mistook the scene for a lovers' quarrel, others for violence.

"Damn, dude looks sharp but he's trash. Public assault?"

"Mind your business. They look like they're into it."

Alexander's expression darkened.

"You hurt me," Isabella rasped, struggling to sit up, her spine screaming in protest.

"Occupational hazard," Alexander muttered, his arm hooking around her waist and hauling her upright in one smooth motion.

Instinctively, she clung to him, her breath warm against his neck. But Alexander only smirked, icy amusement in his eyes. "Ms. Sinclair, aside from my sister, no woman gets this close. You’ve got nerve."

"You're very protective of her." Isabella's lips curved into a practiced, dazzling smile. "She must be stunning."

His gaze lingered on her face, something unreadable flickering in his eyes. The resemblance was uncanny—if she dressed the same, styled her hair the same, even he might mistake her for his sister.

A cold smirk tugged at his lips as he tilted her chin up. "In terms of beauty, you rival her."

Her pulse stuttered at his smile. "But there are levels, aren't there?"

"Of course," he said without hesitation. "My sister is more beautiful."

Was he clueless or just obsessed with his sister? Yet his bluntness didn’t disgust her.

"What are you doing here?" Alexander narrowed his eyes. "You weren’t looking for me, were you?"

Isabella traced a finger down his chest, voice light. "Mister, you must believe fate keeps bringing us together."

Alexander raised a brow. "How lucky for me."

"Thank you for helping me last time." Her fingers toyed with his tie, body pressing closer, eyes shimmering with something dangerous. "I’ve been wanting to repay you."

His gaze deepened, scrutinizing her like a lie detector. But for once, he sensed truth in her words.

"How do you plan to repay me, huh?" His lips curved, inching closer.

Her heart hammered. "Whatever you want. I’m yours tonight."

Then—

The scene shifted.

Isabella stared, stunned.

Alexander’s idea of repayment?

Jenga.

"One block each. Loser drinks three shots." He rested his chin on his hand, carefully stacking the tower. The bartender slid three bottles of premium whiskey onto their table.

Isabella gaped. This wasn’t part of her plan.

"Too strong for a lady? Fine. You drink one, I’ll take three." His eyes gleamed like amber under moonlight. "Ms. Sinclair, game on?"

She exhaled sharply. "A promise is a promise."

The game began.

Alexander was ruthless. Jenga had been his childhood pastime, played endlessly with his sister during downtime at the agency.

Isabella lost the first rounds miserably, downing four shots that burned like fire. Sweat beaded on her forehead, her stomach twisting in agony.

Years of sacrificing herself for Nathan Prescott’s ambitions had left her body battered, her spirit hollow. She’d drowned in alcohol, traded dignity for survival—sometimes drinking until she woke up in a hospital bed.

Her body was a canvas of hidden scars.

"You lost again." Alexander swirled his empty glass, grinning.

Gritting her teeth, she poured another shot. Just as she lifted it, his hand covered the rim.

"Can’t handle it? I’ll take this one for you."

"No." She snatched the glass back. "A bet’s a bet."

She downed it in one go.

Alexander’s smirk softened. Stubborn. Unyielding.

Just like his sister.

The next rounds, he let her win.

"I won!" Isabella threw her hands up, laughing like a carefree girl.

Alexander watched, transfixed. For a second, he saw his sister—bright, untouchable, before life hardened her.

"Evadne," he thought bitterly. "If only you’d stayed that innocent."

"Your turn." Isabella’s breath caught.

A tear?

In Alexander’s eyes?

Gone before she could be sure.

"You won. That’s nice." He clinked his glass against hers. "I hope you always win."

He drank deeply, liquor trailing down his jaw.

Her chest ached. No one had ever wished her victory before. Only demands, control, exploitation.

Her mind blanked.

Then—

Her hands were on his shoulders, her lips crashing against his.

Alexander’s breath hitched. His fingers tangled in her hair, deftly removing the silver hairpin.

Meanwhile, her cleanup crew waited outside until dawn.

No sign of Isabella.

Her phone was dead.

Panicked, Harvey stormed in half an hour later, kicking the subordinate. "You lost her?! A damn guard dog would’ve done better!"

"I—I couldn’t follow! She said she’d handle him alone!"

Harvey paled. Alexander was a lethal agent. Isabella stood no chance.

"I’m reporting this to Mr. Prescott. If anything happens to her, you’re dead."

——

After the Prescott family left, Jason insisted on staying at Silverlake Harbor with Nydia, despite his injuries.

Emeric locked himself in his room, refusing even Daniel’s comfort.

By afternoon, he still hadn’t emerged.

"Chairman Ashbourne needs space," Daniel sighed. "Nydia’s situation hit him hard. But maybe... this is for the best. He might not oppose Jason and Nydia anymore."

Evadne’s eyes welled. "Mr. Lyle, if you can, please... sway him in Jason’s favor."

"I’ll try."

Once Daniel left, Evadne’s gaze turned glacial. "Nathan and Matthew will pull every string to free Byron. We need to block them."

"Leave it to me." Cassius clenched his fists. "Byron won’t have peace in custody."

"And Bertha." Evadne’s voice was ice. "She struck Jason. Handed Byron the knife. If fate won’t punish her, I will."

"Trust me, not fate." Cassius pulled her close. "Write her ending. I’ll make it happen."

Then—

"Cassius! Has Thaddeus lost his damn mind?!" Arnold’s roar cut through the air.

He froze, realizing Evadne was there. Too late.

"Arnold." She stepped forward, eyes blazing. "What happened to Thaddeus? Tell me!"

"He’s been waiting outside our house all night!"
###Chapter 488

The news hit Cassius like a bolt of lightning.

Still waiting?!

Last night, the rain had poured relentlessly until dawn, only to start again this morning. The forecast warned of an approaching hurricane by nightfall.

Thaddeus had been standing outside all this time—without food, without water. Was he trying to kill himself?!

"Thaddeus has been out there the entire time? Even through the storm? What the hell is going on?!"

Evadne's eyes widened in shock, her hands gripping Arnold's shoulders with desperate force. "Tell me! Why didn’t anyone tell me? You saw him, didn’t you? And you kept me in the dark?!"

"Stop shaking me, Evadne! I’m gonna puke!" Arnold groaned, his vision swimming.

"Evadne, enough!"

Cassius stepped in, prying her hands away and pulling her into his arms. "Whatever Thaddeus is doing, it’s his choice. If he wants to stand out there, let him. He won’t stay forever. Eventually, he’ll leave."

His words carried a bitter double meaning.

"Even if he turns to stone out there, it’s his own damn fault!"

Arnold, still furious over everything Evadne had suffered, spat out, "Sis, he’s just playing the martyr, thinking he can win us over with this act. Not a chance! Even if lightning strikes him down, I won’t forgive him!"

"This is between him and me! It has nothing to do with you!"

Evadne’s eyes burned with fury as she struggled against Cassius’ hold. "Did you see him yesterday? Did Emeric see him too? Did you all gang up on him?!"

"Just calm down," Cassius murmured, tightening his grip.

"Evadne, what are you saying? We were standing up for you! We were making him pay!"

"I don’t need you to!"

Tears of rage welled in her eyes, her breath coming in sharp gasps. "Why are you interfering? Is this really for my sake? Or are you just punishing Thaddeus to ease your own guilt?!"

The words struck Cassius and Arnold like knives. Seizing the moment of distraction, Evadne broke free and bolted toward the gates of Silveke Harbor.

Kicking off her sandals, she sprinted barefoot down the endless, ornate corridor.

She hadn’t even laid eyes on the man she loved, yet her heart had already burst from her chest, fleeing the gilded cage of the mansion without a backward glance.

Then—she skidded to a halt.

Bet stood before her, his gaze sharp as a hawk’s, an immovable force. Even alone, his presence filled the space, unstoppable.

"Evadne, you’re going to see him?"

"Bet, don’t you dare stop me," she panted, sweat glistening on her flushed cheeks.

His brow furrowed slightly before he shook his head. "You’ve been a fool for three years. Isn’t that enough? He’s not worth it."

"If he’s not worth it, then who is?!"

Her chest heaved, tears of pain spilling over. "He saved my life when I was eleven! In Zenithia, we fought side by side against terrorists—he risked his life for me! Last year, on Misty Mountain, he took a bullet meant for Cassius to protect me! Tell me, Bet, if he’s not worth it, then who is?!"

"Evadne, I get it. You’ve idolized him since he saved you at eleven. You see him through rose-colored glasses—this unshakable attachment blinds you to anyone else." He exhaled deeply, his voice steel. "But back then, he saved you not because you were Evadne, not because he loved you. It was just coincidence."

"Bet! How can you say that?!"

"Everything he’s done since has been out of guilt, trying to make up for the past. And all the blood and tears you’ve shed for him these past three years? In my eyes, you’ve repaid any debt tenfold. There’s no reason for this to continue. He’s not your soulmate. Holding on will only destroy you."

"Bet! Listen to yourself—are those even human words?!"

Her heart twisted, her vision blurring with tears. "The child we lost was an accident! I didn’t even know I was pregnant—how could he? The miscarriage was my choice to keep secret! It had nothing to do with him! How many times do I have to say it?!"

But Bet’s expression remained cold, unmoved.

"Evadne, you’re young. There are better men out there. Whatever he gave you, they can give you too. And if they can’t, we will."

"I’d rather have one drop from the ocean than all the rivers in the world! Bet, I’m warning you—don’t block me. Don’t make me hate you!"

Like a provoked lioness, she bared her teeth, ready to force her way past. But her slender frame was no match for the soldier’s strength.

With a steely glint in his eye, Bet didn’t flinch. He simply stretched out an arm, blocking her path before effortlessly scooping her up and tossing her over his shoulder.

The world spun as her feet left the ground. She pounded futilely against his back, her fists like feathers against his unyielding frame.

"Evadne, behave."

His voice was low, firm. "I’m doing this for your own good."

Elsie woke groggily in the late afternoon, her head pounding, her stomach churning. The room spun as she sat up, blinking against the dim light.

"Where… am I?"

Then it hit her—she was in a lavish presidential suite, unmistakably one of The Abernathy Group’s hotels.

"Oh no… Elvis!"

Panic surged as she threw off the covers, only to find her dress untouched, pristine. He hadn’t laid a finger on her.

Her last memory from the night before was frozen on that searing, irresistible kiss.

Elsie’s breath hitched, her fingers pressing against her fluttering heart. The room was empty now—no trace of that confident, infuriating man.

"Elvis… what kind of man are you?"

Lost in thought, a knock sounded at the door.

Fighting nausea, she shuffled to answer it. A bellboy stood there, smiling, holding out a small box.

"Good afternoon, miss. A gentleman asked me to deliver these to you. He left a message."

Elsie took the medicine, gripping it tightly. "What was the message?"

"Take two pills twice a day. And don’t skip meals."

With a polite bow, he left.

Elsie stood frozen, repeating the words, her throat tightening. When was the last time someone had cared for her like this? She couldn’t remember.

She was a flower, living in Avery’s shadow—dressed in luxury, admired by men who only saw her as a prize.

Did anyone ever truly care?

But it didn’t matter. She and Elvis were enemies, bound by fate to opposite sides.

Taking a shaky breath, she wiped away the traitorous tear at the corner of her eye. Just as she moved to close the door—

A hand slammed against it, forcing it open.

Dark, familiar eyes glared back at her.

"Harvey?!" Her heart lurched as she hid the medicine behind her back.

"Ms. Archer, alive and well. What a relief."

He barged in, sending her stumbling back. Two of his men followed, silent, their expressions grim as they drew their guns.

"Elvis isn’t here. He’s gone," she said coolly.

"Gone?! You didn’t kill him?!"

Harvey’s face twisted in disbelief. "Then what the hell were you doing last night? Entertaining him?!"

Her head throbbed. "I don’t remember. I drank too much."

"You drank with him?! Do you even realize who he is?!"

Harvey’s voice turned dangerous. "Ms. Archer, you’ve never slipped up before. What happened? This isn’t like you."

"What are you implying? If there was anything between us, do you think I’d be here alone, dressed like—"

Her hand flew to her hair.

Her silver hairpin—it was gone.

Panic surged as she frantically searched the room, tossing aside pillows, checking drawers. Nothing.

Harvey, oblivious to her distress, kept ranting. "I’m not questioning your loyalty, but Mr. Chambers already knows you disappeared with Elvis last night. You think I found you on my own? He tracked you down!"

The image of Avery’s cold, bloodthirsty gaze flashed in her mind. Her stomach dropped.

"You failed to kill him, and you spent the night with him. How can you be sure nothing happened if you blacked out?!"

Harvey exhaled sharply. "Think carefully about how you’ll explain this to Mr. Chambers."

"No explanations are necessary."

Her lashes lowered, her fingers crumpling the medicine box. "I’ve been with Mr. Chambers for years. He knows me. If he doesn’t trust me, then there’s nothing I can do."

Elsie and Harvey left the hotel discreetly.

As their car pulled away, Elvis emerged from the shadows, a tracking device in hand—freshly attached to their vehicle.

His phone screen displayed their route in real time. Following the signal, he traced them to the foot of the hills, where an exclusive, grand social club lay hidden among serene bamboo groves.

Elsie and Harvey stepped out, entered a code, and disappeared inside.

Under the moonlight, Elvis unfolded his palm, revealing a delicate silver hairpin. With a twist, the ruby flipped open—revealing a hidden compartment filled with deadly poison.

"Amateur tricks," he murmured, his lips curling in dark amusement. "You dare play games with me?"

His eyes gleamed with predatory anticipation.

"Woman, crossing paths with me is only the beginning of your tragedy."
###Chapter 489

Lucas stood like a statue outside the gates of Silvercrest Harbor, unmoving for over twenty-four hours. His stubborn nature wouldn't let him rest until he saw the woman he loved or got the answers he needed.

The night before, he had watched from the shadows as the Ashford father and son stormed toward the harbor, clearly furious about something involving Byron. Lucas stayed hidden—not out of fear, but to avoid causing a scene that might upset Jeff and bring trouble to Chairman Ashford.

Dealing with the fallout for the Ashford family in private was one thing. Making a public spectacle would be reckless.

The storm raged around him, wind howling like the punches he'd taken the night before. His deep-set eyes, shadowed and intense, were framed by a jaw rough with stubble. He looked every bit the hardened soldier he once was.

Then his phone buzzed inside his car, pulling him from his thoughts. He grabbed it. Gordon.

"Gordon, what is it?" His voice was raw, drained.

"Mr. Abernathy! Finally!" Gordon sounded near tears. "Mr. Hamilton Abernathy collapsed—he's in the hospital! You need to come back now!"

A sharp pain shot through Lucas' chest. Cold sweat soaked his already damp suit.

Meanwhile, in the wine cellar of Silvercrest Harbor.

Evadne's brothers sat in heavy silence, the only sound the clink of glasses. Ethan, in particular, was downing whiskey like water, much to Adrian's dismay.

"Ethan, stop. You're killing yourself," Cassian said, taking the glass from his hand.

"Seriously, man. You're not even married yet. Don't drink yourself into an early grave," Adrian added.

Ethan slammed his fist on the table.

"You were too harsh with Evadne today," Cassian sighed, patting his brother's shoulder. "You know how she is. Pressure makes her push back harder. You love her—do you really want her to resent you?"

"Cassian's right. You two never fought like this before."

"So what, I just let her keep chasing that bastard?" Ethan dragged his hands over his face, voice thick. "I'd take any pain for her. But watching her suffer? That miscarriage—she could've been a mother. And now—"

The thought of their lost niece or nephew silenced them all, hearts twisting.

"It's all Lucas' fault!" Ethan, usually composed, was on the verge of breaking.

"Never mention this in front of Evadne again," Cassian said roughly, handing Ethan a tissue. "Maybe it's for the best. Kids are a handful. Let her live carefree. We'll protect her."

Then the door burst open.

"We have a problem!"

Daniel rushed in, panicked. "Ms. Ashbourne—she's gone!"

The brothers shot to their feet. "What? How?"

"She jumped out the window!"

They sprinted to Evadne's room. The window gaped open, curtains flapping wildly in the storm. Their sister was nowhere in sight.

"Damn it! How does someone just vanish?" Adrian clutched his head, heart racing.

Cassian and Ethan took one look at the chaos—clothes strewn about—and bolted to the balcony.

Their breath caught. A makeshift rope of knotted dresses hung from the railing, dangling to the ground below.

"Cassian, she's lost her mind! This is the fifth floor!" Ethan's voice shook with fear.

"That reckless girl!" Cassian's terror spiked, imagining the worst. "If that rope had snapped—"

"Stop, I can't—" Adrian pressed a hand to his chest, dizzy.

Daniel was beside himself. "Ms. Ashbourne, please be okay! If anything happens—"

"Does Dad know?" Cassian demanded.

"Chairman Ashbourne's already stressed about Ms. Nydia. I didn't dare tell him."

"Keep it quiet. His health can't take more." Cassian clenched his fists. "No one else finds out. We organize a search now."

"But in this storm? No phone, no money—where would she go?" Daniel was frantic.

"Which is why she can't be far. We'll find her." Cassian scanned the storm. "Is Lucas still out there?"

"Mr. Abernathy left a while ago!"

Adrian cursed. "That bastard picked the worst time to leave! She's probably looking for him, and now they'll miss each other!"

Ethan's heart lurched. He regretted his harshness. Everything was unfolding exactly as he'd feared.

"If she's heading to Elmsworth, we'll find her on the way." Cassian was already moving. "Call Elijah. Tell him to get his ass here and help."

Adrian nodded. "Yeah, that wildcard always has a plan."

Under the stormy sky, lightning split the darkness. Rain pounded relentlessly.

Evadne was drenched, the wind cutting through her, making her shiver uncontrollably.

Her phone was gone. No money. She'd lost her sandals in the escape. Her bare feet were muddy, scratched by stones.

But nothing would stop her.

She knew her brothers would search everywhere. So she avoided main roads, sticking to secluded paths toward Elmsworth. But in this storm, nothing was open.

Dizzy, weak, she stumbled forward—until she spotted dim lights ahead. A repair shop.

Without thinking, she pushed inside.

Four men sat around a poker game, laughing crudely. At her entrance, their eyes locked onto her.

"Well, well. What do we have here?" One leered.

Evadne shivered. "I need to borrow a phone. I'll pay you back."

"Pay us how, sweetheart?" Another grinned, stepping closer. "A kiss? A little touch?"

Her eyes turned to ice.

One reached for her chest. She moved fast—grabbing his arm, twisting it back with a vicious snap.

"Ah! You bitch!"

"You wanted to play?" Her voice was deadly. "Let's play."

Back at the hospital, Hamilton was stable after another stroke, thanks to Mr. Murray's quick action.

But the old man was restless, worn thin by worry over Evadne.

With Frederic away, only Lucas and Mr. Murray remained at his bedside.

Lucas held a bowl of porridge, blowing on a spoonful before offering it to Hamilton.

But how could the old man eat, seeing his grandson battered and broken? "What happened? Did you go after her?"

Lucas swallowed. "Yes."

"Did the Ashford boys do this?"

His silence was answer enough.

Hamilton's anger flared. "Or was it Emeric?"

Another silent confirmation.

"Good! You deserved it! If I were him, I'd have broken your legs!" This time, Hamilton had no sympathy.

"Grandfather," Lucas rasped, voice cracking. "Tell me—how do I get her back?"

Hamilton shook his head. "It's not just you who wronged her. Even I don't know how to face her. We ruined her life."

The room fell silent.

"If you can't fix it, start by protecting her," Hamilton said heavily.

Lucas bowed his head. "I can't let go. But I don't deserve her."

Then his phone buzzed.
###Chapter 490

The screen of his phone lit up with an unknown number, freezing Thaddeus in place. His private line wasn’t something just anyone had access to—he never entertained wrong numbers or spam calls. Yet this time, his pulse roared in his ears like a storm.

He answered.

"Hello?"

Static crackled through the line, mingling with the distant howl of wind.

"Who is this?"

Normally, he would’ve hung up by now. But tonight, he waited.

"Thaddeus."

Evadne’s voice, fragile and broken by the gale, struck him like a blade to the chest.

"Evadne?!"

He shot to his feet, heart hammering. After everything, after all this time—she was calling him.

"I need to see you," she whispered, her voice barely audible. "I’m so tired."

"Where are you? I’ll come right now!" His throat tightened, dread coiling in his gut.

"I don’t know."

A sob tore through her words. "I’ve walked too far. I can’t... I can’t keep going. My head—it’s spinning. I just want to sleep."

"Evadne, don’t!" His grip on the phone turned white-knuckled. "Stay awake. Stay with me. I’m tracing your call—just hold on!"

Hamilton, overhearing, tensed.

"Granddad, I’m sorry—"

"Go." The old man waved him off, urgency sharp in his voice. "Find her. Now."

Thaddeus didn’t hesitate. He bolted from the hospital room, Gordon scrambling after him.

"Bring her back safe!" Hamilton called after him, voice cracking.

Thaddeus barely nodded before throwing himself into his car. The engine roared to life, tires screeching as they tore through the storm-lashed streets of Skyrim.

His men followed in a convoy, struggling to keep up as he wove through traffic like a man possessed.

Gordon clung to the door handle, face pale. "Sir, slow down! You’ll kill us both!"

"Every second counts!" Thaddeus snarled, knuckles white on the wheel. "She could be dying out there!"

The GPS signal flickered.

Then vanished.

"Damn it!" Gordon slammed a fist against the dashboard. "We lost her!"

Thaddeus’s stomach dropped. Please just be a dead battery. Please let her be alive.

They reached the last known coordinates. His men fanned out, flashlights cutting through the downpour as they searched.

Thaddeus charged into the storm, mud splattering his trousers, his shoes ruined. He didn’t care.

"Evadne! Evadne!"

Gordon stumbled after him, breathless. "Sir, watch your step—"

But Thaddeus wasn’t listening.

Evadne had fought off her attackers, stolen a phone, and pushed herself beyond her limits. Fear kept her moving even when her legs gave out, even when her vision blurred.

Now, curled in a crumbling gazebo, she clutched the phone to her chest, slipping into delirium.

In her haze, she dreamed of blood, of screams, of a loss so deep it still bled.

"Evadne!"

A voice cut through the fog.

Warm arms wrapped around her, pulling her against a solid chest.

"Thaddeus...?" she murmured, barely conscious.

"It’s me." His voice was rough, choked. "I’ve got you."

She was burning up.

He stripped off his soaked jacket, bundling her in it before lifting her into his arms.

"The baby," she whimpered, delirious. "Save our baby—"

His heart shattered.

"Shh. It’s okay." He pressed a kiss to her fevered brow. "I don’t need a child. I just need you."

Gordon spotted them first, relief flooding his face as he sprinted over.

Thaddeus carried her to the car, wrapping her in a blanket, his grip almost bruising.

"Drive. Now."

"No hospital," Evadne whispered, fingers weakly clutching his. "My brothers... they’ll take me away. I don’t want to go. I want to stay with you."

"You’re burning up—"

"Just medicine. Please."

Her eyes fluttered shut.

Thaddeus exhaled sharply, then turned to Gordon. "Change of plans. We’re going to Jareth’s."

Dawn hadn’t yet broken when the knock came.

Jareth, still working in his study, frowned. At this hour?

Lily’s voice was tense through the door. "Mr. Fairhaven—it’s Mr. Abernathy. And he’s brought Ms. Ashbourne."

Jareth was on his feet in an instant.

Downstairs, Thaddeus sat rigid on the sofa, Evadne limp in his arms, her face flushed with fever.

Jareth’s stomach dropped. "What the hell happened?"

"I didn’t know where else to go," Thaddeus said hoarsely. "She didn’t want a hospital."

"You’re always welcome here." Jareth motioned to Lily. "Get the doctor. Now."

Evadne shivered. "Cold..."

Thaddeus held her tighter, willing his warmth into her.

Jareth exhaled. "Thad, I hate to say it, but ever since she met you, this girl’s life has been one disaster after another."

A humorless laugh. "Tell me about it."

"The Ashbournes are probably tearing the city apart looking for her. You’ve basically kidnapped her again."

Thaddeus’s jaw clenched. "Worth it."

Jareth shook his head. "At this point, you two should just elope."

Elope.

The word hung in the air like a promise.
###Chapter 491

Lucas's heart shattered as he took in Isabella's ghostly pale face, her exhaustion carving lines deeper than any wound.

"I want to spend eternity with Isabella. But Daniel, I can't be that cruel. Her family isn't like mine. I'd sacrifice everything for her, but if she lost her family because of me, how could I live with myself? Without their love and support, would she ever truly know happiness?"

His voice cracked like dry earth as he repeated, "I've already stolen too much from her. I nearly destroyed her. Daniel, I can't hurt her anymore; I won't let her lose another thing. I just won't."

"Is that your decision? But have you asked Isabella what she wants?"

Daniel studied his friend's tormented expression, brow furrowing. "There's a hurricane raging outside. Isabella suffered through hell to reach you. Family matters, yes. But right now, you're what matters to her. If you push her away for some twisted notion of her happiness, the next storm might drown you both. Lucas, don't let regret be your legacy."

Each word struck Lucas like a blade, cleaving his soul open.

He remembered Isabella murmuring about their child, begging him to save their baby. Feverish delirium couldn't disguise the festering wound she'd hidden behind every radiant smile—a wound that bled fresh at the slightest touch.

"How do you do it, Isabella? How do you look at my wretched face every day and still smile? How are you still so... kind to me?"

Before his oldest friend, Lucas finally broke. He struck himself across the face with a sound that echoed like gunfire.

"Lucas! What the hell?"

Daniel lunged, catching his wrist. "Get a grip! Self-flagellation won't fix anything! If it did, I'd hand you every knife in this house and let you carve yourself to pieces!"

The doctor arrived swiftly, administering fever reducers and starting an IV. "Had we delayed, her heart could've suffered irreversible damage. Mr. Lockwood, I strongly recommend hospitalizing Ms. Sinclair at dawn. My equipment here is rudimentary—this merely stabilizes her. If the fever returns by tomorrow night, don't hesitate."

Lucas traced Isabella's damp forehead with trembling fingers. Still too warm. Dawn couldn't come soon enough.

"Mr. Lockwood, has Ms. Sinclair suffered a hand fracture? The left pinky shows signs of prior ligament damage." The doctor's sudden question startled him.

"Fracture? What are you talking about?"

"Examine her left pinky—the misalignment suggests either a past break or severe trauma. Even healed, there'd likely be permanent impairment."

Lucas's world tilted. His pulse roared in his ears.

"That's impossible!" Daniel looked genuinely shocked. "The Sinclairs would call a specialist for a paper cut! How could they ignore a fracture? Even a pinky affects dexterity—that's a disability!"

Disability.

The word lodged in Lucas's throat like broken glass. He clutched Isabella's delicate hand tighter.

He'd asked about that finger once. She'd deflected, eyes shuttering. What horror had she buried there?

After the doctor left, Olivia brought fresh pajamas before discreetly exiting with Daniel.

Lucas changed Isabella himself, then knelt with a basin of water, gently washing the mud from her battered feet.

Those perfect feet he'd worshipped were now marred with cuts and grime. The sight hollowed him out.

"Isabella. I swore to bring you joy. Look what I've given you instead."

A choked sob escaped him as his phone vibrated—Alexander calling.

Wiping his eyes, Lucas answered by the window. "Alexander, how's Grandfather?"

"Mr. Reginald is resting, though he refused sleep until Ms. Sinclair was found. Mr. Lockwood, have you—"

"She's safe. Tell him not to worry. I won't leave her side."

However long "always" lasted now.

"Mr. Lockwood, forgive me." Alexander's voice thickened with guilt. "Had I told you sooner about the miscarriage..."

"This tragedy is mine alone."

Silence stretched. Then Lucas remembered—three Christmases past, he'd been overseas inspecting a project. Time zones meant calls from home should've reached him instantly.

"Alexander, you said Isabella called me that day? But I never received it."

"Repeatedly, sir. Though given your precarious position at the firm then, constantly traveling, barely eating... It wasn't deliberate neglect."

Suddenly, lightning struck Lucas's memory. That very day, Victoria Sterling had stormed his office, demanding he attend some gala.

He'd refused, frantic for a meeting. Enraged, she'd snatched his phone—and tossed it into the aquarium.

Was that when Isabella's desperate call came? Darkness yawned before him.

"Mr. Lockwood? Sir?" Alexander's concern spiked.

Bracing against the sill, Lucas felt his body folding inward, soul teetering on collapse.

Next morning.

Isabella's fever broke. Lucas could breathe again.

When her eyes fluttered open, she launched into his arms, their heartbeats syncing as they clung like survivors.

"Lucas... This isn't a dream?"

Tear-streaked, she pinched his cheeks hard—typical Isabella, verifying reality through others' pain.

But Lucas only smiled, stroking her hair. "It's me. Pinch harder if you doubt it."

"Oh, thank God!"

She buried herself against him, sobbing freely. The harder she cried, the more relief flooded Lucas—his fierce girl was healing.

After long moments, he pressed his lips to her ear. "Isabella. I'm so sorry. When you're stronger, punish me however you wish."

"Why? Everything's fine now." Her bright eyes searched his. "Unless... you found a mistress while I was gone?"

Lucas blanched. "Isabella."

"Joking." She pinched his gaunt face, heart aching. "You're skin and bones. Trying to scare me?"

Last night's tear tracks still marked his face. He entwined their fingers tightly, silent.

Instead of speaking, he kissed her—slow, sweet, pouring every unspoken vow into it.

He'd bear her pain. Spend his life making amends, even if it destroyed him.

Downstairs...

When Evelyn woke to news of their guests, excitement lit her face. She rushed to see Isabella, but Daniel caught her waist.

"Sweetheart, give them space. They've endured hell."

"But I miss her!"

"Don't you miss me?" Daniel turned her, eyes pleading. "I worked all night. No love for your husband?"

"You're here every day." She blinked, genuinely puzzled.

Daniel's mock pout was Oscar-worthy.

Disaster. While he burned for her, his wife had settled into comfortable matrimony, finding him... predictable.

Panicked, he crushed her against the counter, kissing her until she melted. Breaking apart breathlessly, he traced her swollen lips.

"Wait a little longer to visit, hm?"

"Okay..." Dazed, Evelyn nodded. "I'll bake her favorite cake. She'll need sweets to recover."

Olivia gathered supplies as Evelyn transformed into a flour-dusted whirlwind. Daniel watched, utterly besotted.

"Darling, feed me a taste?" He leaned in, mouth open.

Giggling, Evelyn smeared frosting on his nose. "Oops."

"You minx." He growled playfully. "Now I'll devour you—"

The doorbell cut through their laughter.

"Daniel, are we expecting anyone?" Evelyn frowned beneath him.

Rarely did guests visit their private sanctuary. Few even knew its location.

"Olivia, check the door," Daniel ordered.

But minutes passed without return. Then—a heavy thud.

"Stay here." Daniel sprinted toward the foyer—and froze.

Olivia was pinned against the wall by a devastatingly handsome stranger who smirked at Daniel's shock.

"Lovely home." Nathaniel's gaze swept the room before landing on Daniel. "Perhaps I'll buy the neighboring estate. Be closer to family."
###Chapter 492

Jareth's entire body tensed as Evander's brother, Elias, strode into the room with the effortless confidence of a rockstar.

People called Jareth the "Grim Reaper," but next to Elias, he might as well have been a harmless shadow. And since Elias was Evander's brother? Jareth wouldn't dare lay a finger on him.

"Mr. Fairhaven, I'm so sorry." Lily panted, her eyes brimming with regret as she looked at Jareth.

Jareth swallowed hard, his voice urgent. "Don't be reckless! A man like Elias doesn't waste his time fighting women. That's beneath him!"

"So what, I'm just supposed to stand here and let her beat me to a pulp?"

Elias yawned, his expression bored. "Do I look like I enjoy pain to you?"

His words left Jareth speechless.

He knew Lily too well—fierce, loyal, and utterly devoted to her master. Anyone who dared cross her boss would face her wrath without hesitation.

"But you're right. I don't hit women."

With a careless shrug, Elias released his grip and smirked. "Lucky for you, sweetheart, you're a woman. Otherwise, I would've broken those pretty little claws of yours already."

"Jerk!"

Lily, proud and unyielding, couldn't stand the humiliation. She clenched her fists, ready to strike again, but Jareth's sharp command stopped her.

"Lily! Stand down! He's Ms. Ashbourne's brother!"

Lily froze, her eyes widening in realization.

Her brother?

The wild, untamed man before her—was Evander's brother, the heir of the Ashbourne family?

Elias stuck his tongue out at the stunned Lily before turning a cold, assessing gaze on Jareth.

"Evander and Thorne—they're with you, aren't they?"

Inside the room, the atmosphere was thick with emotion.

Evander noticed the bruise on Thorne's face, her expression shifting between shock, anger, and concern as she cradled his face. "Who did this? Tell me!"

"I tripped on my way here," Thorne offered weakly, his lips quirking into a wry smile as he gently held her hands.

"Bull! You tripped face-first? Since when are you that clumsy?"

Evander's cheeks flushed with anger. "When you visited the other day—did Emeric and my brothers do this to you?"

Thorne quickly shook his head. "No, really, it wasn't them."

"It had to be! You were in the peace corps—you can handle yourself. Even Elias could only fight you to a standstill! Who else could've done this unless you let them?"

Tears welled in Evander's eyes as she hesitated to touch the bruise, not wanting to hurt him further. "Even if they were angry, there's no excuse for hitting your face! What's wrong with them?"

Thorne's gaze softened with affection, already over the incident.

But seeing her so distressed, his heart twisted with a mix of happiness, sorrow, and regret. His eyes reddened as he gripped her hand tightly, unwilling to let go.

"Evander, none of that matters. Nothing is as important as having you back by my side."

His voice was thick with emotion, nearly choking on the words.

With tears streaming down her face, Evander threw herself into his arms. "Thorne, I'm back. I never want to leave you again."

Suddenly, urgent knocking shattered the moment.

"Thorne! Evander! Open up!"

Evander and Thorne exchanged puzzled glances. "Is that Mari?"

Thorne lifted her from the bed, supporting her waist as they moved to the door and opened it—

Mari stood there, her eyes red-rimmed, cheeks smeared with frosting. "Thorne! Evander! Trouble! Someone's after Evander!"

"Trouble?" The couple froze.

The next second, Elias's tall, imposing figure appeared behind Mari, his gaze icy.

"Evander."

"Elias!"

Evander paled, her voice sharp. "Thorne! Close the door, quick!"

Thorne, usually unflappable, hesitated at the sight of Elias.

But Mari sprang into action, sweat beading on her forehead as she scrambled to help shut the door.

Yet no matter how fast she was, Elias was faster. His strong hand stopped the door from closing. Mari pushed with all her might, but it wouldn't budge.

Seeing his sister—once so close to him—now terrified as if he were a ghost, Elias sighed deeply, a bitter smile on his lips. "Evander, don't hide from me. I didn't come to drag you back."

Thorne's eyes flickered, and Evander stared in disbelief. "Huh? Elias."

"I never intended to keep you two apart."

Elias looked at the couple who had suffered so much yet still couldn't find peace together, his heart heavy. "I came to make sure you were safe—not sick, not hurt. Don't be afraid."

Those simple words struck Evander straight in the heart.

Elias was visibly moved, his lips pressed tightly together.

After all this time, he never would've imagined that among Evander's family, someone would stand by him—someone who trusted him.

"Elias!"

Evander stepped forward and embraced him. He returned the hug warmly, stroking her hair tenderly. "You reckless girl. Jumping from five stories to escape? If you'd gotten hurt, how could we go on?"

"Evander!" Thorne's eyes widened in shock.

"I'm fine, aren't I? It was just five floors." Evander sniffled, unashamedly wiping her nose on Elias's shirt.

"I know you too well. Who could ever stop you from doing what you want? Forget five floors—you once jumped out of a plane over Star Island!" Elias scolded, his eyes filled with affection as he pulled out his tie and wiped her nose.

The only woman who could make Elias melt had always been—and would only ever be—her.

"Can we stop the nonsense now?"

Evander sniffled, her nose bright red from crying.

Just then, Jareth rushed in, his forehead creased with anxiety.

Relieved to see the situation relatively calm, he took a deep breath and pulled Mari into his arms.

"Uh, Jareth... did I misunderstand this gentleman?" Mari lifted her innocent face, guilt written all over it. "I thought he was a bad guy."

"Indeed, this gentleman is not a bad guy."

He's the devil incarnate! Even the worst criminals would call him their ancestor!

After calming Evander down, Elias coolly raised an eyebrow and approached Thorne.

"Mr. Ashbourne, thank you for giving me a chance," Thorne rasped, his voice low.

Suddenly, everything went dark before his eyes!

Elias's brow twitched violently, and he threw a punch straight at Thorne's face!

"Thorne!"

"Elias! Stop!" Evander tried to intervene, but it was too late.

Thorne remained unfazed, ready to take the blow.

But just half an inch from his nose, Elias stopped, letting out a cold laugh. "Don't flatter yourself too much. I'm just making sure my sister isn't heartbroken over you. Did you really think your dirty tricks would work on me?"

Thorne felt as if his heart had been crushed by a stone, trembling with pain. "I'm sorry. I know I deserve the worst. But still, thank you for not taking Evander away. Even if it's just for a little while—being with her, every second, every minute, is a treasure to me."

Elias paused, slowly withdrawing his hand.

Evander, unable to wait any longer, returned to Thorne's side, their fingers tightly interlocked.

"Let's talk about something happier," Elias said, his voice softening as he didn't want to see the pain in his sister's eyes. "Evander, that woman who looks almost exactly like you—I've found her hideout."

The news Elias brought was monumental for Evander and Thorne!

Jareth perked up, but he didn't want Mari involved in this mess. He sent her back to her room with Lily and stayed behind for the details.

Thorne held Evander close on the sofa as Elias recounted his encounter and skirmish with Elsie—how she'd hidden weapons, tried to seduce him, but ended up outwitted by him.

However, he didn't tell them—

That night, Elsie had suddenly kissed him, a gentle nibble turning passionate.

Amid the deep kiss, he remembered her soft sobs, tears streaming down her face.

She came for his life—and she was the one crying?

"Damn, this is insane!" Jareth was dumbfounded.

Elias shot him a disdainful look. "There's always one fool in the crowd."

Jareth clenched his teeth, his face screaming patience.

He couldn't beat Elias. Elias was Evander's brother and Thorne's brother-in-law. Picking a fight would leave him battered inside and out!

"Look at you, rejecting a seductress who came knocking. Didn't take the bait, Elias? Haven't you been off the market for a while? What a rare opportunity—a night worth a thousand gold," Evander teased, leaning into Thorne's arms.

"Do I look like I've never seen a woman before? You think I can't control myself every time one throws herself at me?" Elias retorted, taking another jab at Jareth. "I'm not him."

"Damn it!" Jareth's face turned red, cursing inwardly.

"But she looks so much like me. You always said you wanted a wife who looked like me—our brother called you a freak for it," Evander continued, though Thorne beside her felt a surge of jealousy.

His face reddened too, much like her brother's.

"I've never settled for counterfeits in my life—why would I start with a woman? Am I sick in the head?" Elias finally lost his cool.

"Alright, alright, I'll stop," Evander said, her tone turning serious despite her teasing. "You said you used that woman as bait at the hotel, lying in wait for the person pulling the strings. So—who does she work for?"

Elias's lips curled into a scornful smirk as he pulled out his phone and placed a picture on the coffee table.

All three leaned in to look.

The atmosphere in the room dropped, the air almost freezing over!

The man in the photo leading Elsie away was all too familiar—

Avery's secretary, Harvey!

"It's him. It had to be him!"

Evander seethed with rage, trembling with fury. "He wasn't content with trying to kill my brother and Debby—now he's targeted you, Elias! He's utterly heartless!"

But this time, Avery had miscalculated.

They said Avery was a cold-blooded snake—but they had a python in their midst: Elias!

Thorne moved to soothe Evander's trembling form, his warm hands gently rubbing her shoulders, comforting her without words.

In truth, he had suspected this all along. Now, with confirmation, he wasn't surprised.

"That time, Thorne, you were lured to the hotel by this woman and then fell into Edith's trap. Now it all makes sense. Avery was behind it—using this woman and my naive sister to drive a wedge between you and Evander, forcing you to marry Edith! Such a twisted, venomous plot—it's pure Avery!"

Jareth gritted his teeth. "He almost made Evander misunderstand you, made everyone think you were a scoundrel, and turned you into Chairman Ashbourne's enemy. He almost succeeded! Too malicious!"

Evander's chest ached, her lashes drooping with remorse.

"He won't succeed."

Thorne lowered his gaze, pressing a tender kiss to her cheek. "My girl knows I'd never deceive her. She'll come to trust me in time."

"You're such a fool."

Evander hunched her shoulders, a playful pout in her voice as embarrassment flushed her face. "And what if I can't figure you out? What if I refuse to turn back to you?"

Thorne's eyes curved into a beautiful arc as he gazed at her, brimming with adoration. "If you don't turn back for a day, I'll wait for a day. If you never turn back, then I'll wait a lifetime."
###Chapter 493

The sight of the two lovers wrapped in each other's arms sent a surge of conflicting emotions through Sebastian, but in the end, he found solace in their happiness.

As her protective older brother, wasn't his sole purpose in life to ensure Arabella's joy?

And that happiness wasn't for anyone else to judge—only her. It was her choice, her right.

After enduring countless trials, she had chosen Nathaniel without hesitation. To take that love away from her now would be the cruelest act, the true destruction of her happiness.

"Dominic's been pulling the strings from the shadows, manipulating Victoria," Nathaniel said, his voice dark with frustration. "We cornered her at that dinner, pressed her for answers, but even then, she refused to betray him."

Arabella nodded in agreement.

Harrison's fists clenched, trembling with barely contained fury. "I'm so sorry, Nathaniel, Arabella. 'Spare the rod, spoil the child,' they say. This is my fault—mine and Mom's—for indulging her too much!"

"Harrison, don't blame yourself," Nathaniel said gently. "This isn't your doing."

"She could've been someone decent, but instead, she chose to be Dominic's lapdog!"

With a violent swing, Harrison shattered the porcelain teacup on the table. "If she's so eager to follow that bastard, maybe I should just throw her at him and let her grovel at his feet!"

Arabella bit her lip, unsure how to comfort him.

Having a sister like this was nothing short of a family tragedy.

"Look, I don't mean to be crass, but judging by Miss Elara's looks, Dominic clearly has standards," Sebastian drawled, lounging back on the sofa. "With your sister's face, she wouldn't even get close enough to polish his shoes."

Silence.

A beat passed as everyone processed Sebastian's blunt remark.

"I suspect Elara is one of Dominic's most valuable assets," Arabella mused, studying the photo of the woman who looked eerily like her. "After all, 'a woman's beauty is a deadly weapon.' She must have been by his side for years. That face is likely his masterpiece—proof of just how deep their connection runs. She must know all his secrets."

Harrison's jaw dropped. "Damn. So because he can't have Arabella, he keeps a lookalike around to satisfy his sick fantasies? Is she supposed to be some kind of substitute?"

Substitute.

The word sent a cold fury through Nathaniel. The thought of Dominic keeping that woman as a stand-in for Arabella, indulging his twisted desires in the dark—

His grip on Arabella tightened instinctively.

"Ugh." Arabella shuddered. "He's disgusting. But even as a substitute, she deserves better than him."

Sebastian continued, "I followed them to the mountainside, saw them enter an exclusive private club. Members-only, password-protected. I didn't follow them inside—didn't want to tip them off."

"Mountainside? A club?"

Nathaniel wasn't familiar with such places, and Arabella, not being from Elmsworth, was even less so.

They both turned to Harrison.

"You mean The Velvet Haven?" Harrison ventured.

"Bingo! Leave it to Harrison, the professional playboy," Sebastian teased, snapping his fingers.

Harrison's expression soured. No matter the context, those words never felt like a compliment.

"I checked through the Sky System, and guess who owns The Velvet Haven? Dominic himself," Sebastian said, his expression hardening. "He's been spotted there countless times, rubbing elbows with Elmsworth's elite. On the surface, it's a high-end club. Underneath? A den of corruption. Dominic's nothing but a glorified pimp."

"The Sky System? Are you serious?" Arabella's eyes widened. "That's like using a nuclear bomb to kill a fly! Sebastian, don't risk your career over this—it's not worth it!"

"Arabella," Sebastian said, his deep-set eyes narrowing as he took her hand, "there's nothing I wouldn't do for you. Don't worry—an occasional use won't raise alarms. Besides, I'm tired of playing games with that snake Dominic. I want to help you both end this quickly."

Not just him. Both of them.

Nathaniel was deeply moved, speechless.

Arabella's eyes glistened as she curled her fingers around Sebastian's. "Sebastian... thank you. Really."

"I know how badly you want the family to see that Nathaniel was framed by Dominic," Sebastian said with a scoff, glancing at Nathaniel. "Otherwise, forget marrying into the family—he might not even make it past the front door."

"Sebastian!" Arabella scolded.

"Come on, our Nathaniel's got nerves of steel when it comes to Ms. Sinclair!" Harrison laughed, clapping Nathaniel on the back.

Silence.

A metaphorical crow could have flown through the room.

Arabella sighed. "Harrison, you do lighten the mood. But maybe keep some thoughts to yourself next time."

Harrison shut his mouth like a chastened child.

"Since this woman is clearly important to Dominic, we shouldn't touch her yet," Nathaniel said gravely. "We'll monitor her movements discreetly."

"Monitoring isn't enough," Arabella countered, her mind already spinning schemes. "We need to turn her. Bring her to our side. First, we investigate her, understand her, then win her over."

Nathaniel frowned. "Arabella, that won't be easy. Dominic's been embedded in Helgen for fifteen years. If he hadn't cultivated loyalists, his influence wouldn't have spread this far. That woman knows she's your stand-in, knows she's being used—yet she's stayed by his side for years. An outsider won't easily break that bond."

"Why not?"

Arabella's gaze settled meaningfully on Sebastian. "With me and Sebastian on the case, I'm not worried about winning her over. The other night, she was armed and ready to kill him—yet in the end, she spared him. I think she's taken a liking to him. And if that's true, then this honey trap might just be our key to cracking this case."

Nathaniel and Harrison exchanged uneasy glances.

The Sinclair heiress was ruthless—even willing to sacrifice her own brother!

They expected Sebastian to explode, but instead, the man smirked, mischief dancing in his eyes.

"Fine. Let's see what this woman's made of."

Holy hell. He was actually going along with it!

Was this what they called professional dedication?

"Arabella, this is too dangerous," Nathaniel protested. "That woman didn't succeed last time, but she'll try again. She's under Dominic's thumb—she could use any dirty trick in the book. We can't possibly guard against them all."

Before Arabella could respond, Sebastian scoffed, a wild, wicked grin spreading across his face.

"Please. No one in this world can hurt me."

A bloodcurdling scream echoed from the damp, musty basement of The Velvet Haven, making even the hardened guards at the door flinch.

The scene inside was even more horrifying.

Elara's wrists were shackled, her slender body suspended midair. The sheer silk slip she wore was nearly transparent—and now stained crimson with blood.

Dominic, exhausted from his exertions, collapsed onto the couch, tossing the whip to Vincent before downing a glass of red wine in one gulp.

"Mr. Chambers..." Vincent trembled as he took the whip.

"What? Feeling sorry for her?" Dominic's lips curled into a cruel, bloodthirsty smile, his glasses spattered with droplets of red. His eyes gleamed with terrifying sharpness. "Or do you want to end up just like her?"

With no choice, Vincent approached the battered Elara, teeth clenched.

"Elara... just endure it. I have to follow Mr. Chambers' orders."

Elara gasped weakly, lifting her heavy eyelids. "Don't hold back. Beat me to death. It'd be a mercy. My life is worthless anyway."

Her words sent Dominic into a rage.

He stormed over, shoving Vincent aside before grabbing Elara by the throat.

"So you've developed feelings for Sebastian, have you?"

His grip tightened, his eyes wild with fury. "Is this your way of defying me? The old Elara would do anything to survive. Now you don't want to live? Your life belongs to me, Elara. Only I decide when you die. You don't get to choose!"

Elara's breath grew faint, her face turning from red to purple.

In the past, she would have pleaded—

She loved no one. From the moment she saw him at fifteen, her heart had room only for this man who wanted her dead.

But now, defending herself felt like a pathetic joke.

Even if she could explain about the night she shared a room with Sebastian, about the box of antacids he gave her—which Dominic burned to ashes—

She couldn't justify the tender kiss they'd shared.

Vincent, terrified, cried out, "Mr. Chambers! Please—you're going to kill her!"

"She betrayed me! She got close to Sebastian! Doesn't she deserve to die?" Dominic roared.

"Elara has used her charms to get you out of countless tight spots over the years!" Vincent argued desperately. "This time is no different! And Sebastian—he's the toughest of the Sinclair brothers! If Elara can get close to him, we'll have our chance to eliminate him!"

The words seemed to snap Dominic out of it.

His grip loosened slightly.

"Elara! Stop being stubborn—apologize to Mr. Chambers!" Vincent urged.

"I'm sorry," Elara whispered, her voice broken and hollow. "But Dominic... what am I apologizing for? I've done everything you asked. You never cared for me, and I accepted that. What else do I owe you an apology for? Tell me. Tell me!"
###Chapter 494

Nathaniel's lips twisted into a sneer as he tightened his grip on her throat. "So, this is why you found yourself a man who gives a damn about you?"

The mockery in his voice cut through Isabella like shards of glass.

"Alexander cares for you? Loves you?" His laughter was cruel, devoid of warmth. "Because he spent one night with you, because he brought you a damn box of antacids—you think that means anything? You think you matter to him?"

He released her abruptly, pressing a finger against her forehead instead. "I thought, despite your pathetic existence, you had at least some sense. But now I see—you're worthless. To have Evelyn's face and waste it like this... it's an insult to her beauty."

Through her blurred vision, the man she had loved for a decade became unrecognizable—a stranger carved from ice.

Tears streamed down her cheeks, raw and unchecked, but Nathaniel remained unmoved. "Stop deluding yourself. The Kingsley men—I know them better than anyone. They're just like me. Their hearts belong to Evelyn. They only love Evelyn. With your background, with you being nothing more than my pawn—do you really think you could ever catch his eye? The moment he learns the truth about you, death will be the only thing waiting for you."

He pulled a handkerchief from his suit pocket, meticulously wiping the blood from his fingers. "Wake up, Isabella. You don’t stand a chance."

"And what about you?"

With a desperate burst of defiance, she smiled through bloodied lips. "Do you think you're worthy of Evelyn? No matter how hard you try, in her eyes, it's always Sebastian. Only Sebastian."

Nathaniel's face twisted as if struck. His fists clenched, knuckles cracking with terrifying force.

"Isabella! Just stop!" Harvey, sweating profusely, stepped between them. "Mr. Sinclair, think rationally! You can't hit her again—you might actually kill her! And what use is a corpse to you? That's a loss, isn't it?"

Nathaniel's expression darkened, then slowly eased.

Harvey knew him too well—knew what he wanted.

Nathaniel was the embodiment of calculated self-interest. He only valued what benefited him.

As long as Isabella had use, he wouldn’t destroy her.

His phone buzzed in his pocket.

Nathaniel turned away, tossing the handkerchief aside. The moment he saw the caller ID, his demeanor shifted. He answered immediately.

"Mr. Sinclair, you must be feeling triumphant lately."

The voice on the other end was crisp, laced with condescension. "With all obstacles removed, the entire Kingsley family despises Sebastian. They're at war with him. Your chances with Ms. Kingsley must be looking up, no?"

Nathaniel's jaw tightened, recalling Evelyn’s disdain and Emeric’s indifference. "I appreciate your assistance, but the situation is... complicated. Still, I swear—I won’t give up on Evelyn, not even in death."

"Ah, you're still too soft. Hesitation only brings you pain while your enemies rejoice." The man’s voice dripped with lazy amusement. "If I were you, I'd take what I wanted by force. Even if she resists, it's better than wasting my efforts. And if that fails—ruin her completely."

Nathaniel froze. "I need more time. There are... loose ends to tie up. Once that's done, I'll make Evelyn mine."

"Put your family drama aside. You have a bigger problem."

The man’s tone turned icy. "Elspeth’s trial is approaching. Neither Frederic nor his lawyers could stop it."

"The prosecutor is Evelyn’s brother, Arnold. The lead detective is her other brother, Aaron. The judiciary is stacked with Kingsley loyalists. Frederic’s hands are tied."

"Ward has already sung like a canary. Without concrete evidence linking Elspeth to murder, a harsh sentence is unlikely. But mark my words—Sebastian and Evelyn won’t let her off easy. And they certainly won’t spare you."

A dark chuckle. "What will you do, Mr. Sinclair? Your fiancée is hell-bent on seeing you dead."

Nathaniel adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses, his eyes bottomless. "Even if I can’t have her love, her hatred is worth living for."

"And Eden? If he falls into Evelyn and Sebastian’s hands, your days are numbered."

"A new private jet arrives next week."

Nathaniel’s smile was charming, yet chilling. "Then, I’ll send him and his brothers on a one-way trip to hell."

Alexander, after a brief reunion with his sister, left early to update his brothers.

Evelyn, still reeling from the night before, felt filthy despite her clean pajamas. Her hair and skin carried the grime of the ordeal—an unbearable torment for someone as fastidious as her.

"Ugh, I reek!"

She wrinkled her nose, nearly gagging. "I can’t stand it! I feel like a worm dragged through mud—I need a shower!"

Sebastian pulled her into his arms, burying his face in her hair. "You smell sweet to me."

"I don’t care. I need to wash!" She squirmed in his embrace, restless as a slippery eel.

"Evelyn, you just recovered from a fever. Your body is weak. A shower could make it worse."

His fingers brushed her forehead, voice tender. "If you’re uncomfortable, I can sponge you down. How does that sound?"

"No! That’s not the same!"

She wrapped her arms around his waist, tilting her head back. Her eyes shimmered with playful pleading. "Please? Just turn up the heat in the bathroom. I’ll be fine."

Sebastian’s lashes lowered as he gazed at her. His resolve crumbled. "I can never refuse you. Fine. I’ll draw your bath and warm the room."

As he moved to stand, Evelyn suddenly grabbed his hand.

"Sebastian." Her doe eyes held his.

His pulse stuttered. "...Together?"

"Together."

His eyes darkened. In one swift motion, he lifted her into his arms, carrying her to the bathroom like a cherished princess.

Steam filled the room as Evelyn sank into the bubbled water, utterly exposed before him.

Yet Sebastian remained fully dressed—white shirt, black trousers—kneeling beside the tub like a devoted servant, gently washing her.

Evelyn scooped foam and blew it at him. "Pfft!"

"Mischief," he chuckled, bubbles clinging to his brows as he pinched her chin affectionately.

"What’s gotten into you today? So... restrained."

Her body rose slightly from the water, lips brushing his ear. "Usually, you’re like a starving wolf. Can’t keep your hands off me. When did you become so... chaste?"

His chest ached.

Once, he had craved her day and night.

Now, he felt unworthy.

"Evelyn... can I ask you something?"

His voice was rough, measured. "Back then... why didn’t you tell me?"

The question haunted him. If he had known about the baby—if he had known they’d lost their child—

"Sebastian, stop torturing yourself. It wasn’t just your fault. As the mother, I failed too."

Her lashes fluttered, smile accepting. "Even if you had known, it would’ve been too late. The important thing is Grandpa survived. That alone was a blessing. Otherwise, I’d carry that guilt forever."

Through the steam, Sebastian’s throat tightened. "And after? You had countless chances. Why stay silent?"

She sank deeper, voice small. "You were always traveling, coming home exhausted, irritable. I didn’t want to add to your burden. Didn’t want you to feel... trapped."

"Trapped?"

"Because back then... you didn’t love me."

Her fingers curled into the water. "Having a child with a woman you didn’t love—that’s a prison, isn’t it? I wanted you to love me, but not out of obligation. I know your heart. That’s why I couldn’t chain you with guilt."

So all her suffering stemmed from him—a so-called "good man"?

Tears fell, cutting through the foam on his cheeks.

"Evelyn... what’s so good about me? You shouldn’t have loved me." His voice broke like a lost child’s.

"Fool. If not you, who else?" Her damp hand gripped his. "You were the light I chased. If you want to make it up to me—then promise never to let go."

With a tug—

She yanked him into the tub. Water splashed, bubbles erupting as their lips crashed together in a feverish kiss.

Lost in the warmth, they drowned in each other.

Later, night fell.

Though cleansed by Sebastian’s love, Evelyn’s fever spiked.

Jareth’s personal doctor arrived, administering an IV.

Once settled with an ice pack on her forehead, she finally relaxed.

Sebastian adjusted the drip, kissing her heated cheek. "I told you not to bathe. Next time, no arguments."

She smirked. "And how exactly did this fever return, huh?"

His ears reddened.

Just then, Gordon called.

"Gordon. What is it?"

"Sir! Byron’s been bailed out—by the Sinclairs!"
###Chapter 495

"What the hell happened?" Alexander's piercing gaze met Isabella's as tension crackled between them.

"Just now, Nathan and Theodore took him out of custody—and they brought an army of reporters with them!" Olivia's voice trembled with fury. "Theodore had the audacity to spin the whole thing in front of the cameras, painting Byron as some innocent victim caught in a misunderstanding!"

"Unbelievable!"

Isabella shot upright in bed, nearly yanking out her IV. Alexander caught her instantly, pressing her back down. "Easy, love. You'll hurt yourself."

"How is that bastard Byron walking free?"

She snatched the phone, desperation sharpening her tone. "Alexander and I had everything under control! Emeric knew—he cares about Nydia! How could he let the Chambers family pull this off? Why didn’t he stop them?"

"Mrs. Kingsley, please, try to stay calm." Olivia sounded just as frantic. "I'm still gathering details. I'll update you and Mr. Alexander as soon as I can."

The call ended, but Isabella was already dialing another number—until Alexander's phone buzzed again.

Her breath hitched.

"Isabella, who is it?" Alexander asked softly, seeing the storm in her eyes.

"Cassius."

Alexander exhaled, his grip tightening around her. "Answer it. Don’t make your brother worry."

The memory of her brothers' suffocating control made her chest tighten. She answered sharply.

"If you're calling to drag me back, save your breath. If not, make it quick."

On the other end, Cassius flinched. Once, she’d been so warm with him, her voice honeyed with affection.

Now?

Every word between them was laced with tension.

"Isabella, Elvis told us everything." Cassius’s voice softened. "If being with him makes you happy, then I won’t stand in your way anymore."

Isabella froze.

"You were right to call me out," he continued, a bitter laugh escaping him. "I was angry—at myself for failing to protect you. I tried to control your life to ease my own guilt. But that wasn’t love. Real love means letting you choose your own happiness."

Her heart clenched.

Alexander, listening, felt his own throat tighten.

"I'll talk to Bet. As for Dad..." Cassius hesitated. "He’ll come around. Eventually. So, Alexander—you know what’s expected of you now."

"I do." Alexander’s voice was rough with emotion as he pulled Isabella closer. "She’s my everything. I’ll protect her with my life."

No more words were needed.

The siblings had reached an understanding.

To Isabella, Cassius was as irreplaceable as Alexander. She didn’t want to fight him—she just couldn’t bear the weight of their family’s expectations.

"Cassius, how the hell did Byron get released? Why didn’t Emeric stop this?"

"That’s why I called." Cassius’s voice turned grim. "Myra, worried about Nydia’s reputation and our family’s standing, convinced Dad to drop the charges."

"Drop the charges?!" Isabella and Alexander gasped in unison.

"How else do you think Byron walked free?" Cassius’s frustration bled through. "The Chambers Group has already bought off half the media in Elmsworth. They’re spinning Byron as the victim. Legally, we can’t touch him now."

"Is Emeric out of his mind? Sacrificing his own daughter’s dignity for appearances? Since when do the Ashbournes care more about reputation than justice?"

Isabella was shaking with rage. "Myra’s too soft—this has to be Emeric’s doing!"

"You’re wrong this time." Cassius sighed. "It was Myra and Nydia’s decision. Dad fought them at first, but Myra stood her ground. He had no choice but to back down."

Isabella’s vision swam with fury.

It was like watching a teammate throw the game at the last second.

Nydia was the Ashbourne heiress, unmarried and vulnerable. If this scandal went public, she’d be the one crucified—not Byron. The internet was merciless, especially toward women.

Alexander stroked her back, his voice calm. "Don’t blame them, love. They made the choice they thought would protect Nydia."

"Those vultures online are nothing but jealous nobodies!" Isabella spat. "And high society? Who cares what they think! Myra and Nydia are Ashbournes—they have more power than any of those parasites!"

Cassius stayed silent. He knew his sister well enough to know words wouldn’t soothe her now.

But Alexander wasn’t giving up. "You’re right. But not everyone is as fearless as you, Isabella. Not everyone can weather that storm."

She clenched her fists. "Fine. But we’re not letting this slide. Byron—and the entire Chambers family—will pay."

A cold smirk curled Alexander’s lips. "If the law won’t punish them, we will."

Isabella took a deep breath, forcing herself to think. "Those online trolls—in my room, on my laptop, there’s a file on Margaret’s husband. Corruption, bribery, abuse of power. Give it to Arnold. He’ll know what to do."

Both men stared at her, stunned.

Even while trapped in family drama and heartbreak, she’d been digging up dirt.

"And that’s not all," Alexander murmured, pressing a kiss to her hair. "I’ve been looking into Margaret. She’s got skeletons too. If my darling wants to start with her, we’ll make it happen."

"Why, Nydia? Why?"

Jason knelt beside the bed, gripping her hand. "I could’ve been your lawyer. We could’ve crushed the Chambers family in court! Why back down now?"

"I’m sorry, Jason."

Nydia curled into herself, tears spilling. "I know you’d fight for me. But I can’t let you."

His heart shattered.

The real villains were the Chambers Group—and that monster, Byron.

"Jason, please. Let it go. Don’t fight for me anymore."

She shook her head, voice breaking. "I’m still an Ashbourne. The Chambers Group can’t touch me. But you? Your family? What if they retaliate? And Byron... he ruined me. Even if he didn’t... finish... if this gets out, how will your family see me?"

"Nydia..." His voice cracked.

Suddenly, he understood.

Her fear wasn’t the media.

It was the Dempsey family’s judgment.

"Jason, I’ve loved you since we were kids. I still want to be your wife."

Her fingers brushed his cheek. "But your family already dislikes me. If I come to them stained by scandal, they’ll never accept me. And you’ll be torn between us."

Torn.

The same word Isabella had used.

Both sisters were too selfless, swallowing their pain to protect the ones they loved.

Isabella had survived.

But when would Nydia’s suffering end?

Jason pulled her into his arms, holding her like she might vanish.

"Marry me. Now."

His voice was raw with emotion. "No one else will ever be my wife but you."

She closed her eyes, savoring the moment.

The future was uncertain.

But for now, this was enough.

Then—a knock.

Aviana’s anxious voice cut through the moment.

"Jason, are you in there? You need to come downstairs."

He frowned, standing. "What’s wrong?"

Aviana glanced at Nydia, then pulled him into the hall, shutting the door firmly.

"Your mother and brother are here."
###Chapter 496

Lucas's stomach dropped as he sprinted down the stairs toward the grand foyer.

With Alexander out of town and news that his defiant daughter had once again slipped away to see Nathaniel—even jumping out a window in the process—the family patriarch was furious, his anger burning like a wildfire. With Mr. Langley in tow, he had stormed toward Elmsworth.

But halfway there, their car was abruptly halted by Dominic and Sebastian. Dominic, determined to stop Alexander from tearing apart the young lovers, had gone as far as slashing the tires of the million-dollar Bentley.

Where the brothers had taken the old man and what was happening now remained a mystery.

Now, the house was left almost entirely to the women.

"Mom, you're not well. Please, take it easy."

Oliver gently guided the exhausted Mrs. Kingsley to the living room sofa, soothing her. "Now that we know Lucas has been with Isabella these past few days, there's no need to worry. Lucas is nearly thirty, and this is his first love. Of course, he's going to be head over heels. Part of raising a son is preparing for this—for when he chooses a wife. But I'm sure Lucas wouldn't abandon us. He's always been the most devoted of us three to you and Dad. Maybe it's best not to overreact. Your health is what matters most."

Though Oliver's words were meant to comfort, they carried a mocking edge that only stoked the flames.

As expected, Mrs. Kingsley's expression darkened further. She clutched her chest, coughing weakly. "I see your brother is determined to follow the path you've laid out for him! If I don't intervene now, will he even remember I'm his mother? Or care about the Kingsley name at all?"

"Mom, you're overthinking it. It's not that serious!" Oliver patted her back reassuringly.

"You're right. Lucas is just inexperienced with women. That's why he's so easily swayed by that girl and has changed so drastically!"

Mrs. Kingsley bit her lip in frustration. "If I don't step in now, he might be taken advantage of without even realizing it. Wouldn't I be failing as his mother?"

"Taken advantage of? I wonder who Mrs. Kingsley fears might deceive her precious son."

A cold, commanding voice suddenly filled the room, startling both Mrs. Kingsley and Oliver.

Seraphina and Arabella entered arm in arm, Seraphina exuding the effortless elegance of a woman born into privilege.

Mrs. Kingsley forced a polite smile. "Seraphina, how have you been?"

Of Alexander's three wives, Arabella and Victoria, with their less prestigious backgrounds, had always been beneath her notice. But Seraphina was someone she dared not disrespect.

"Mrs. Kingsley, I know you're deeply concerned for your son. But you raised a son, not a daughter. Isn't it inappropriate to coddle him like some fragile greenhouse flower?"

Ignoring her greeting, Seraphina scoffed. "You'll smother any strength out of him. Besides, you can control him now, but can you forever? It might be wiser to relax and enjoy your golden years with Mr. Kingsley. Otherwise, you risk losing even the bond between mother and son."

The words struck a nerve. Mrs. Kingsley shot up from the sofa, furious. "Seraphina, I know my own son better than anyone. I do this precisely to protect our bond! Lucas is young and naïve, especially when it comes to matters of the heart. He doesn't realize what kind of woman is truly right for him, and he might stray without even noticing!"

Arabella's eyes flashed with anger, her breath heavy with indignation.

This woman was insulting Isabella without even saying her name, and Arabella couldn't stand it.

Though she wasn't quick with words, Seraphina immediately became her voice, her gaze sharp and unyielding.

"Mrs. Kingsley, are you referring to Isabella? Choose your next words carefully."

Oliver, sensing the tension, quickly grabbed his mother's arm, eager to escalate the situation.

But Mrs. Kingsley, driven by maternal instinct and provoked by Seraphina, laughed bitterly. "Oh, Seraphina, don't misunderstand. My children know their place. They would never dare reach for the lofty branches of the Sinclair family. A noblewoman like Ms. Isabella is suited for someone of the Vanderbilt family's standing, not ours."

Arabella's face flushed with rage, her lips trembling.

Seraphina, too, was barely containing her fury, wishing she could shove dirt from the nearest flowerpot into the woman's mouth.

"Mom! What are you saying?"

Lucas stormed down the stairs, his eyes blazing with fury, his entire body radiating anger. "How can you say such things?"

Seeing her son with a bandaged eye and bruises on his face, Mrs. Kingsley burst into tears. "My boy, what happened to you? Who did this? I'll make them pay!"

As she reached out to touch his cheek with trembling hands, Lucas sharply pushed her away.

"If you ever want me to call you 'Mom' again, those words you just said—they better never leave your lips again!"

Lucas was seething, veins bulging, one eye bloodshot. "And one more thing—Isabella is my woman. I will marry no one else in this lifetime. Don't you dare associate her with the filth of the Vanderbilt Group ever again!"

"Lucas!"

Mrs. Kingsley, publicly humiliated by her own son in front of the Sinclairs, was mortified, speechless with rage.

"Lucas! What are you doing?"

Oliver rushed forward to steady his unsteady mother, his face full of brotherly concern. "Do you have any idea how much Mom has been worrying about you? You've been sued by the Vanderbilts!"

Seraphina and Arabella couldn't hide their shock.

Only Lucas, his handsome face composed, remained unfazed. His voice was ice. "So what? It's none of your business. I'll handle it myself."

"Handle it? With what? You're just making things worse!"

Frustrated, Oliver pointed at Lucas's face. "The Vanderbilts are pressing assault charges. Who knows what else they have planned? Fighting them is suicide. And these injuries—you know exactly how you got them!"

"Oliver! Shut up!"

Lucas lunged forward, grabbing Oliver by the collar and lifting him effortlessly. "If you really cared about Mom and Dad, you wouldn't have told them about this! Don't think I don't see what you're doing. If you have a problem, take it up with me! But if you dare mess with Isabella or her family, I swear I'll destroy you!"

Mrs. Kingsley finally understood—and shuddered. Her son had crossed one of the big four families, the Vanderbilts, and now they were out for blood.

What did it matter that the Kingsleys had supported the Sinclairs for years? To the K Group, they were disposable. Alexander and Jeff were close. If real trouble came, would they stand by her son?

And the reason Lucas was in this mess? All because of Isabella, that mistress's daughter!

Why did she have to bring disaster upon her son?

Overwhelmed, Mrs. Kingsley clutched her chest, her body drenched in sweat. She collapsed, weak and powerless, into Oliver's arms.

"Damn it! Mom's having a heart attack!"

Oliver quickly pulled nitroglycerin pills from his pocket and shoved them into her mouth, yelling at Lucas. "Call an ambulance, now!"

No matter how much Lucas wanted to stay with Isabella, he couldn't ignore his mother's crisis. He had no choice but to rush her to the hospital.

After the explosive confrontation, the grand living room was eerily silent, the air thick with tension.

Arabella clutched her blouse with one hand and Seraphina's arm with the other, unable to speak.

"Arabella, are you okay?" Seraphina gently rubbed her cold hand.

"I'm fine." Arabella's voice was hoarse and shaky.

"The Vanderbilts may be snakes, but this Kingsley family—no saints either!"

Seraphina shook her head in disgust. "After everything Alexander did for them, we thought they'd be grateful. Turns out, we've raised ungrateful dogs! Lucas is a good man, but his parents, his brother... I fear for Isabella. If she marries into that family, they'll eat her alive!"

"Seraphina, stop." Arabella closed her eyes, tears spilling as she shook her head in self-blame. "It's not Lucas's fault, or anyone's. Blame me for being weak, for not securing a better future for my daughter."

What they didn't know was—

From the shadows of the upstairs landing, Isabella had heard everything.

She heard the cruel words. She saw how Lucas had fiercely defended her.

And that was exactly why her heart felt like it was being torn apart.

Leaning against the wall, she staggered to a dark corner, crouching down with her knees to her chest, wishing she could disappear.

"Isabella? Isabella, are you there?"

Victoria, following the sound, found Isabella curled up like a wounded kitten, sobbing uncontrollably. Never having had children of her own, Victoria's maternal instincts surged. She pulled the girl into her arms.

"Sweetheart, why are you crying alone?"

Tearful and vulnerable, Isabella looked up pitifully. "Victoria, do Lucas and I really have no chance? Mrs. Kingsley hates me. Am I really that terrible?"

"Nonsense! Don't you dare put yourself down! That old hag can't see the treasure you are! Don't let her poison get to you!"

Isabella's tears soon turned to laughter at Victoria's fiery words.

"That's my girl. You're always most beautiful when you smile." Victoria wiped away her tears, though her own heart still burned with indignation.

After settling Isabella in her room, Victoria couldn't shake her anger. She grabbed her phone and dialed a number she hadn't called in years—

An old associate from her days at Celestial Media, a young man her father had mentored, named Preston. Once a nobody, he now held considerable influence.

"Is that my princess? I can't believe you're calling me in this lifetime. Am I dreaming?" Preston sounded near tears.

"No, you're not dreaming. Cut the flattery—I need you to rough someone up for me." Victoria, as always, wasted no time.

"Who? Just say the word."

"Oliver."

Preston didn't ask for details. "The usual way?"

"The usual way. Just make sure he doesn't die—but beat him within an inch of his life!"
###Chapter 497

The next evening, in a lavish nightclub drowning in neon lights and the scent of expensive liquor, Cedric Abernathy reveled in the company of stunning women and top-shelf drinks. Tonight, he was untouchable—a king in his own right.

Across from him sat Matthew Chambers, the golden heir and CEO of the Chambers Group. This invitation wasn’t just a social call—it was a stamp of approval, tying Cedric to the Chambers family’s empire.

Now he had both the Abernathy and Chambers names in his pocket. The Ashbournes? They didn’t stand a chance.

"Mr. Chambers, you flatter me. A small favor, really," Cedric smirked, his arm draped around a blonde who giggled on cue.

"A few drinks are nothing," Matthew replied, swirling his wine with a lazy smirk. "Not many would dare frame their own brother for assault. Clever move—hurts Byron, derails Jason’s little romance with Nydia. Your mother would never let her precious son marry the Ashbourne mistress’s daughter. One stone, two birds."

If he couldn’t strike Thaddeus and Evadne directly, he’d gut the people they loved.

Byron wouldn’t get the woman he wanted. And Jason? He’d learn the hard way.

"All thanks to your generosity, Mr. Chambers," Cedric chuckled, his eyes glinting with greed beneath the charm. "Considering the target was my own flesh and blood, your offer was more than fair. I’m happy to play my part in your grand design."

"No guilt?" Matthew arched a brow.

"He’s no brother of mine," Cedric spat. "Just Evadne’s lapdog."

Matthew tsked, sipping his wine with a smirk.

"Mr. Chambers, my reputation in the legal world speaks for itself. Byron’s case? A guaranteed win. And if your group ever needs… discreet assistance, I’m at your service."

Matthew’s gaze flicked to Cedric’s eager smile. "No wonder you’re so well-connected. A master of manipulation. Though I heard your unbeatable streak took a hit recently. Elspeth’s trial? Public outcry, open court—even the Abernathy name couldn’t bury it. Word gets around. Makes me wonder… can I trust your expertise?"

Cedric’s smile froze. Humiliation burned through him.

"Public or not, the courtroom is my stage. Elspeth won’t walk free, but she’ll get the lightest sentence possible." He downed his drink, teeth clenched. "Just watch."

"I’ll hold you to that," Matthew drawled. "Prove yourself here, and we’ll talk future collaborations."

Later, stumbling toward the parking lot, Cedric’s high had crashed into a suffocating weight.

It hit him—Matthew had played him. Empty promises from a viper’s nest.

"Damn it!" He ripped off his tie, spitting on the ground. "Once Elspeth’s trial is over, you’ll beg for my help. And I’ll laugh in your face!"

As he fumbled for his phone, four thugs materialized from the shadows, bats in hand.

"What the hell—?"

"We’re here to teach you a lesson," one grinned.

The first swing sent him crashing to the pavement.

"Do you know who I am?!" Cedric howled, pride warring with panic. "I’m the Abernathy Group’s legal advisor! The Chambers CEO’s associate! Touch me, and you’ll rot in prison!"

The thugs laughed. "Prison’s a second home to us. And you? You’re just a bottom-feeding lawyer."

The beating began.

Cedric curled into a ball, arms shielding his head as kicks and bats rained down.

"Mercy! Please!"

Minutes later, he was a broken mess—fractured, bleeding, begging.

Nearby, a luxury car idled.

Lionel leaned against the window, recording the scene with glee before sending it to Aviana.

[Miss Aviana, want me to make it worse? Maybe feed him something special?]

A teddy bear emoji followed—oddly innocent for the S-Star Group’s ruthless boss.

Aviana’s reply was swift:

[Disgusting.]

Then:

[I love it.]

Lionel grinned. [Your wish is my command.]

But she didn’t reply again.

He pouted, scrolling through her sparse messages. "Couldn’t even chat properly."

Five days passed.

Emeric had stormed to Evadne’s hideout, only to be "escorted" away by Cassius and Elvis. No matter how he threatened, the brothers stood firm—their sister was safest with Thaddeus.

Emeric, at sixty, realized one bitter truth:

His children were united—against him.

Meanwhile, Byron, fresh out of prison, replaced his missing teeth and threw a debauched party. Models, booze, pills—until an overdose sent him convulsing to the hospital.

Jeff fumed but swallowed his rage. The Ashbournes had dropped charges. He’d bide his time.

Cedric fared worse.

After the beating, Lionel’s men forced him to swallow something unspeakable.

For days, he retched, feverish, haunted by the memory of a red bird pin on one thug’s lapel.

The S-Star Group’s emblem.

He screamed into the night.

That evening, Elmsworth’s elite gathered for a high-profile reception.

Bertha Chambers, dressed like a queen, had spent weeks prepping for this—her husband Edgar was steps from the mayor’s office. Her dream of being First Lady was within reach.

As she adjusted his tie, her advice spilled out in a frantic stream.

Edgar shoved her hands away. "Enough! You’re worse than a nagging fishwife!"

"Ungrateful wretch! Without me, you’d be nothing!"

He stormed out—just as his phone buzzed.

Bertha unlocked it.

Affairs. Multiple.

She hurled the phone at his face in the bathroom. "You dare cheat on me?!"

"You snooped?!"

"I’m your wife!" She clawed at him.

Edgar shoved her back. She hit the door, gasping.

"You hit me? My family will destroy you!"

"Go ahead! Ruin years of work! But remember—if I fall, you crash with me."

Her face paled.

He straightened his collar, sneering. "Play the doting wife in public, and we’ll both win. Cross me, and it’s over."

He left.

Bertha sat numb, then forced a smile in the mirror.

"A few tramps mean nothing. I’ll be the mayor’s wife. Then… I’ll bury them all."

At the Hall, Elmsworth’s power players mingled under glittering chandeliers.

The Bartleys, the Gardners, Jeff and Matthew Chambers—all basking in the spotlight.

No one noticed the black van parked outside.

Inside, Thaddeus hauled Evadne onto his lap, his mouth claiming hers with possessive hunger.

"Mmm—enough!" She pushed him back, lips swollen. "We’re here to work!"

"This is work," he murmured, nipping her ear. "I’m insatiable when it comes to you."

"Thaddeus!"

"Admit it," he teased, fingers tangling in her hair. "You’re just as addicted."
###Chapter 498

Isabella Sinclair had always yearned to hear those whispered affections, words that once felt as distant as starlight.

But now, Alexander Kingsley had become relentless, murmuring sweet nothings into her ear day and night until she nearly groaned in exasperation.

Yet every time he drew close, every brush of his fingers, every searing kiss, her mind erupted in sparks, leaving her powerless to resist his teasing seduction.

Love wasn’t measured in words.

It was in the way her pulse quickened, her cheeks burned, her body betrayed her resolve.

Breathless from his kisses, Isabella tangled her fingers in his tie. "Alexander, you used to be so composed. Now, you're like some—some—"

She bit her lip, censoring the crude comparison dancing on her tongue. Even if it was true, a lady had to maintain some dignity.

Alexander’s breathing was ragged, his gaze dark with hunger as he traced her neck, their foreheads touching.

"Isabella," he murmured, voice rough, "I'm your devoted hound."

Her heart stuttered. Heat flooded her cheeks as she poked his chest. "Stop that. Insulting yourself is like insulting me."

He swallowed hard, nipping at her lower lip. "Lucky for us, we've got an SUV today. Plenty of space to... play."

"I came for revenge, not to fool around in a car!"

Her face burned as she flicked his forehead, swiftly changing the subject. "Speaking of which, where’s the Fairhaven heir today? Nathaniel is practically a CEO. Wouldn’t he want to steal the spotlight from the Chambers family?"

"The Fairhavens are still dealing with the fallout from Vanessa’s mess. They’re under scrutiny. Showing up now would only stir controversy."

"Smart move," she scoffed.

Alexander nuzzled her cheek. "Nathaniel also said he hates these events. Prefers staying home wrapped around his wife."

"You’ve been wrapped around me for days," she grumbled, wriggling free. "I wake up sticky and disheveled every morning. Separate beds tonight!"

He watched her retreat with a wounded look. "Don’t be cruel, Isabella."

A knock interrupted them.

Isabella lowered the window to find Daniel Carter waiting.

"Mr. Kingsley, Mrs. Sinclair, everything’s ready inside."

"Thank you, Daniel," she nodded, then added sternly, "Stay sharp. Today is critical. The Sinclair family isn’t here. If the Chambers spot you, they’ll suspect something."

"Don’t worry," Alexander pulled her close. "I have people inside too."

Reassured, Isabella opened her laptop, fingers flying across the keys as lines of code cascaded down the screen.

Alexander watched, equal parts admiration and insecurity flickering in his gaze.

"Done." She hit enter with finality. "Now we wait for the show to begin."

He massaged her hand, ready to stand by her through hell or high water.

Inside the grand hall, tension hummed beneath the polished surface of Elmsworth’s elite.

Mr. Bartley concluded his speech to thunderous applause.

The emcee stepped forward. "Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Congressman Edgar Gardner, who will present Elmsworth’s three-year economic vision!"

Edgar strode onto the stage, basking in the spotlight—until the screen behind him flickered.

His smile shattered.

Instead of his meticulously prepared slides, a handwritten ledger appeared—dates, amounts, names. A damning record of bribes.

Edgar swayed, blood draining from his face.

Margaret Laurent felt the world tilt beneath her.

Murmurs erupted into a roar.

"Is that—a bribery ledger?"

"Look! That’s Edgar’s signature!"

The screen changed again—photos of Edgar entering exclusive clubs, accepting lavish gifts, flanked by two women as they disappeared into a private room.

The crowd exploded. Cameras flashed like lightning.

"Mr. Gardner! Are these allegations true?"

"Did you accept bribes? Engage in illicit dealings?"

Edgar staggered back, sweat pouring down his face. "This—this is a setup! None of this is real!"

But the evidence glared back at him, undeniable.

In the chaos, Harrison Blake’s face darkened with fury.

"Find out who’s behind this!" he snarled. "This isn’t just an attack on Edgar—it’s a direct strike at the Chambers family!"

Nathaniel Whitmore gripped his phone. "We need to get you out of here. If this escalates—"

"No!" Harrison barked. "Leaving now makes us look guilty. We face this head-on."

Nathaniel’s phone buzzed. Margaret’s frantic voice crackled through. "Nathaniel! Meet me in the hallway—now!"

When he arrived, Margaret was pacing like a caged animal.

"Nathaniel, you have to save him!" she begged, clutching his arm. "If this gets out, his career is over!"

Nathaniel’s jaw clenched. "With this many witnesses? It’s already out."

Margaret’s knees buckled.

"Tell me the truth," he demanded. "Are those documents real?"

She closed her eyes and nodded.

"You let this happen?" Nathaniel hissed. "After everything the Chambers family invested in him?"

"And what about the benefits you reaped?" she shot back hysterically. "His position helped us all!"

"Enough!" Nathaniel silenced her with a glare. "I’ll contain what I can. But prepare for the worst."

Margaret’s sobs were swallowed by the rising storm.
###Chapter 499

The venue was in complete chaos. Security personnel scrambled to maintain order, but the pandemonium was beyond control.

Today's event had turned into a media frenzy. Reporters swarmed Edgar like vultures to carrion, trapping him from all sides. He was completely immobilized, with no escape in sight.

That's the media for you—scandal was their oxygen, their lifeblood.

And this wasn't just any scandal. It was explosive.

Jeff's son—Edgar, the rising star in the mayoral race—was exposed as nothing more than a corrupt leech, lining his pockets while indulging in every vice imaginable.

Every journalist in the room was desperate for the exclusive. They looked ready to tear Edgar apart, piece by piece.

"Mayor, should I call for backup? This is spiraling!" His secretary rushed to Mr. Bartley's side, face etched with worry.

Mr. Bartley stood in a quiet corner, deliberately avoiding the spotlight. A smug smile played on his lips as he watched his rival drown in the chaos. Why get our hands dirty when we can enjoy the show?

"Let them fight. No need to intervene. Just make sure my wife and I stay out of the crossfire."

To prevent further escalation, the Chambers family tightened security at every entrance.

Then, three sleek black sedans pulled up with authority, parking directly in front of the venue.

The doors swung open. Out stepped a team of prosecutors in sharp suits, badges gleaming under the harsh lights.

Leading them was Arnold, his usual playful demeanor replaced by a steely intensity. His commanding presence was breathtaking.

The security guards exchanged nervous glances as the prosecutors marched forward.

"Step aside. Do not interfere with official business," Arnold said coolly, his voice devoid of warmth.

The guards hesitated but ultimately yielded.

Arnold tapped his earpiece as he stepped inside. "Evadne, I'm in."

"Hmm. That was easier than expected," came her surprised reply.

"Of course. You didn’t think I’d fail you, did you?"

His bravado lasted all of three seconds before the Chambers family’s men moved to block their path—a wall of muscle and menace.

"Looks like you spoke too soon," Evadne teased, laughter dancing in his ear. "Not as smooth as you thought."

"You can see me?" Arnold tensed, scanning the room.

"Every move. I’ve got eyes on everything inside."

Elsewhere, Evadne lounged back, watching the live feed of Edgar being mobbed and Jeff looking like a cornered rat.

"This is better than I imagined," she mused, lips curving.

Arnold straightened his tie. "Just watch. The grand finale is mine to deliver."

"Confident words, Prosecutor Arnold. But you still need to get past those guards first."

Before she finished, Thaddeus’s warm hand settled on her shoulder, his touch reassuring. "Don’t worry. I’ve got people inside. They’ll clear the way."

Her eyes softened. Independent as she was, she found herself leaning into his embrace. With Thaddeus, she didn’t have to be the thorny rose—just his.

"Unauthorized personnel are not permitted," one of the Chambers’ bodyguards barked.

"Arnold, Elmsworth Attorney at Law," Arnold countered, eyes like ice. "I have a warrant for Edgar Gardner’s arrest. Stand down."

"We’ve received no such orders. No entry."

Arnold smirked. "Interesting. You’re not official security. Which means you’re with the Chambers family."

Panic flickered across the guard’s face.

Before they were deployed, Mr. Chambers had been clear—deny any affiliation. If Edgar was taken, it was game over.

"We’re with Mr. Bartley!" the guard bluffed.

"Oh? Funny. I don’t recognize you."

A calm voice cut through the tension. All heads turned.

Mr. Bartley’s chief of staff approached, flanked by his own security.

The Chambers’ guard paled.

"Bold of you to impersonate our staff and slander the Mayor," the chief of staff said sternly before turning to Arnold. "Prosecutor, perhaps you should arrest these obstructionists too. Clear our Mayor’s name."

Arnold nodded. "Justice will be served."

"Excellent. The Mayor is eager to cooperate with the DA’s office."

The Chambers’ men were outmaneuvered. No one dared block the prosecutors now.

Arnold strode forward, his team in tow.

The chief of staff slipped away to make a call.

Meanwhile—

Thaddeus had Evadne pinned against the car window, his lips claiming hers in a deep, possessive kiss.

She gasped when he finally pulled back. "You’re everywhere. Even in Bartley’s inner circle?"

He smirked. "Money and influence open doors, darling."

She tapped his cheek. "Arrogant."

"Bartley’s a tyrant. His chief of staff has been overlooked for years. Loyalty has its limits."

Her eyes gleamed with understanding. "So you offered him a better future."

"Exactly. He’ll be useful."

Just as Matthew thought he had the situation under control, Arnold and his team stormed in.

"Matthew! Stop them!" Bertha shrieked, clinging to him.

"Shut up!" he snapped, silencing her.

Arnold shouldered past him. "Step aside, Mr. Chambers."

Matthew’s glare burned into Arnold’s back.

The reporters parted as the prosecutors approached Edgar, whose face had gone ghostly pale.

Arnold held up the warrant.

"Edgar Gardner, you’re under arrest for embezzlement, abuse of power, and bribery."

The room fell silent.

Game over.
###Chapter 500

Nathaniel Sinclair's world collapsed as the prosecutors closed in. His knees buckled, and in front of the entire crowd, he crumpled to the floor like a puppet with its strings cut.

Social media exploded. Every headline screamed the same news—Nathaniel Sinclair was under arrest.

Reporters swarmed Harrison Prescott like vultures.

"Mr. Prescott! What's your reaction to your son-in-law's arrest?"

"Did you know about Mr. Sinclair's illegal activities?"

"Has Mr. Sinclair been secretly benefiting the Prescott Group? Were there under-the-table deals?"

Harrison's face turned ashen, his blood boiling with rage.

He had trusted Alexander to handle everything, but the DA's office had broken through—led by none other than Reginald Kingsley's second son, Oliver!

Two powerful moguls, yet here was Reginald's son arresting his son-in-law, humiliating him in front of the world.

If only he had slipped away in the chaos. What a colossal mistake.

"Dad! We need to leave!" Alexander rushed to his father's side, dragging him toward the exit.

The reporters wouldn't relent, chasing them like a pack of wolves. In the frenzy, Harrison lost a shoe.

"My shoe!" Harrison lifted his bare foot awkwardly.

"Dad, forget the shoe! Move!" Alexander, drenched in sweat, pulled him forward.

So Harrison limped away, one shoe missing, fleeing like a disgraced man.

"Look! Whose shoe is that?"

"Is that Harrison Prescott's? Did he run so fast he lost it? Pathetic!"

Cameras flashed, capturing the abandoned shoe. Laughter erupted.

As Nathaniel was dragged out by the DA, his legs barely worked—paralyzed by fear.

Across the street, Isabella and Alexander Kingsley watched it all unfold.

Gordon had already popped the champagne, grinning. "Congratulations, Mr. and Mrs. Kingsley. A power couple indeed."

They clinked glasses, their eyes locked in silent understanding.

"Thank you, Alexander," Isabella murmured, her voice soft but laced with unspoken emotion. "Working with you has been... exhilarating."

"I didn't do much," Alexander started, then nearly slipped—almost calling her wife. His heart stuttered. He corrected himself quickly. "This was all you, Isabella. Your strategy, your brilliance. I just played my part."

He envied men like Daniel, who could openly call their wives mine without hesitation.

But he had no right to claim her. He had lost that chance too many times.

Now, just being near her was a miracle.

Isabella saw his hesitation, the flicker of regret. She leaned in, her fingers brushing his jaw before pressing a kiss there.

Gordon discreetly stepped out of the car—a good secretary knew when to disappear.

Alexander's breath hitched, his grip tightening on her waist. "Isabella, don't tease me. My self-control is already hanging by a thread."

Her lips curved against his ear. "Then don't resist. Tonight, I'll reward you properly."

The gala, meant to be Elmsworth's crowning moment, ended in disgrace.

Nathaniel's corruption was exposed, sparking public fury. Even the President took notice, demanding a full investigation into the Sinclair family and their political ties.

The Chambers Group—now the Prescott Group—was under fire, its reputation in tatters.

Harrison, scrolling through social media in the car, saw his lost shoe turned into a meme—"Billionaire's Choice: Run Like Hell!"—and in a fit of rage, hurled his phone, shattering the windshield.

Back home, Harrison couldn't sleep. He summoned the family for an emergency meeting.

Byron stumbled in, still drunk, until a sharp slap from his father sobered him up.

Avery lounged in his chair, watching with detached amusement.

"Someone is targeting us!" Harrison roared, slamming his fist on the table. "Who dares humiliate the Prescott Group?"

After decades of power, he had never been so publicly shamed. His fury demanded blood.

"Dad, with Nathaniel arrested, we need damage control," Alexander said coldly. "Cut all ties. Destroy any evidence linking us to his deals. The President's involved—we'll be next."

"Arrested? Why?" Byron blinked, still dazed.

"You useless drunk!" Harrison snarled. "While your brothers handle business, all you do is whore and drink! Tell me—how did I end up with a son who can't even perform?"

The insult hit Byron like a knife. He hated being compared to Avery, hated any mention of his... shortcomings.

"It's Isabella's fault!" Byron spat, face red with rage. "That quack ruined me during my surgery! She sabotaged me!"

"And who exactly are you calling a quack?" Avery's voice cut through the room like ice. His pale lips barely moved, but his gaze promised violence. "Say it again. Who ruined you?"

Byron flinched. Once, he would've fought back. Now, crippled and disgraced, he had no spine left.

"Byron, if Isabella wanted to hurt you, she would've let you lose that leg," Avery sneered. "Not sabotage your pathetic sex life. Keep your stupidity in this house. Don't embarrass us further."

"Enough!" Harrison rubbed his temples. "Who leaked that footage? Who has the power to bypass security and broadcast it live?"

"The Bartleys?" Byron muttered.

"No." Alexander shook his head. "They wouldn't risk it during the gala. This was calculated. Ruthless." His jaw tightened. "This has Isabella's fingerprints all over it."

Harrison scoffed. "That girl?"

"Got proof?" Avery challenged. "Or are you still bitter she humiliated you at the Ashbourne event?"

"This isn't about pride," Alexander snapped. "After what happened with Byron, we declared war on the Ashbournes. Isabella warned us. And now, here we are." His eyes darkened. "Who led the arrest? Her brother Oliver. Coincidence? I think not."

Avery's fists clenched.

"If Isabella wanted revenge, why target Nathaniel?" Byron started—then froze.

Because he and Margaret had conspired against Natalie.

Was Nathaniel just the first domino?

"Dad! Alexander! You have to save Nathaniel!" Margaret burst in, makeup streaked with tears. "He's been loyal to this family!"

"Loyal?" Harrison laughed bitterly. "He's a liability. Distance yourself, or I'll disown you."

Margaret paled.

"Margaret, the DA will summon you," Alexander said flatly. "We'll arrange a press conference. You'll publicly denounce Nathaniel, deny involvement, and try to salvage the Prescott name."

She nodded numbly.

Avery stayed silent. He despised his family's corruption but wouldn't let the empire fall.

Let Alexander clean up the mess.

He'd reap the rewards later.
###Chapter 501

The bedroom was bathed in silvery moonlight, the air thick with the intoxicating scent of jasmine.

Alexander's defined muscles tensed beneath her as he watched the woman astride him with a gaze so intense it could shatter glass.

If only he could fuse her into his very bones, let her dissolve into his burning bloodstream.

"Mm. I'm new at this. Don't judge me if I'm terrible," Isabella murmured, her delicate palms pressed against Alexander's heaving chest, her lips curved in shy anticipation.

His hands gripped her slender thighs, his fingertips turning her fair skin pink with restrained desire.

He never expected her "reward" would be taking control.

Sure, they'd made love countless times before—always with him leading, pouring every ounce of passion into pleasuring her.

But now, the roles had reversed. How could he not be electrified?

"Like this?" she whispered, cheeks flushed.

Alexander's breathing was steady, but the tremble in his muscles and the fire in his eyes betrayed his hunger.

"Isabella, don't push yourself," his voice was rough with need.

She shook her head, eyes closed. "Isn't trying new things part of the fun?"

"Of course. I just don't want you uncomfortable." His voice wavered slightly.

"Silly."

She leaned down, tracing his lips with her fingertip. "We all have strengths and weaknesses. Just guide me if I need it."

By the time their passion burned out, Isabella felt half-dead.

Exhausting.

Lying back was so much easier.

She could barely keep her eyes open, but Alexander seemed inexhaustible—even cleaning her up afterward.

Was he some kind of immortal?

The next morning, sunlight streamed through the curtains before she stirred, her body aching too much to move.

"Keep monitoring the situation," Alexander's deep voice reached her from across the room.

She turned over, blinking sleepily at his broad back.

Then her heart skipped.

She buried her burning face in the sheets.

His back was covered in fresh red scratches—evidence of last night's fervor.

"Awake?"

He turned, stroking her cheek tenderly. "I asked Olivia to prepare something delicious for you. Rest more. You must be exhausted."

"Yeah."

Isabella yawned, her voice soft and drowsy. "Who were you talking to? Daniel?"

Alexander settled beside her, pulling her into his arms. "I instructed Daniel to keep the pressure on Vanderbilt Industries online. Let them 'enjoy' the spotlight."

"Good move." She kissed his cheek, brightening.

He smiled. "Also, the Vanderbilts are making their move."

"Oh? What now?" Her interest sharpened.

"They're holding a press conference to 'clarify' the club incident."

"Clarify? More like disown." She chuckled, drawing lazy circles on his chest.

"With Adrian down, their plans are ruined. Now they're scrambling to contain the fallout."

Alexander's gaze turned icy. "To show 'sincerity,' they'll hold the conference soon—likely within days."

"Hmph. Adrian may be beyond redemption, but the Vanderbilts refusing to take responsibility is despicable."

"Don't worry, Isabella. I promised justice for Seraphina, and I won't stop until it's done. Anyone who hurts you or those you love will pay a thousandfold." His jaw clenched.

Listening to his steady heartbeat, Isabella felt warmth spread through her.

She loved Alexander for his unwavering sense of justice, his fearless integrity. They shared the same values—hearts full of light and love.

He took her hand, noticing the numbness in her pinky, and frowned. "Isabella, what happened to your finger?"

"Just an old climbing accident. It doesn't bother me," she said lightly, smiling. "I'm a grown woman. Don't worry so much. We have our whole lives ahead—you'll give yourself a heart attack at this rate."

"Because it's you," he murmured, kissing her forehead.

Because when it comes to you, even the smallest detail echoes endlessly in my heart.

"Alexander, I know you carry guilt over the past—struggling to face me sometimes. But I hate seeing you like this."

Her voice softened as she traced his jaw. "I know what it's like to feel unworthy before someone you love. I don't want that for you—the self-doubt, the torment. We fought hard to be together. I want us to be healthy, bright—simple and pure, like any other couple."

She had endured so much for his love, waking from nightmares in tears.

She loved him too much to let him walk that painful path.

Alexander understood. His heart ached as he propped himself up, veins standing out on his arms, and captured her lips again.

Another wave of passion—sometimes fierce, sometimes tender—left her dizzy, floating on clouds.

"Isabella, once the Vanderbilt matter is settled, let's go abroad," he whispered against her ear. "A real adventure. Didn't you say you wanted to see the snow-capped mountains? I'll take you."

Her lashes fluttered. "Okay."

As a doctor, she knew of a renowned specialist there.

Alexander was always thoughtful, but he wasn't one for idle romance. This sudden trip had purpose.

He wanted her to see a specialist. Even if hope was slim, he had to try.

She understood. If it gave him peace, she'd go.

Sebastian had gathered irrefutable evidence. From the moment Adrian entered the courtroom, his fate was sealed.

Margaret, usually domineering, now found herself abandoned—treated like a plague carrier.

Forced to follow her family's orders, she would publicly apologize at the press conference. Humiliation burned through her.

Why should she bear this disgrace?

The Vanderbilt men—her own flesh and blood—had shoved her into the fire while they hid like cowards. Was this honor?

The conference was set for two days later.

Margaret had spent days in a living nightmare—no appetite, no sleep, only rage.

That afternoon, drowning in wine at the bar, she sobbed over her ruined years of effort.

"Instead of crying, why not consider how this happened?"

Her tears stopped abruptly at the smooth voice.

Adrian Lockwood smirked as he sat across from her, pouring himself a glass of red.

"What do you mean?"

"Exactly that." He sipped leisurely. "You've covered Mr. Vanderbilt's misdeeds for years. Everything was fine. So why now?"

Margaret's alcohol-fogged mind struggled.

"Don't you remember what you recently did?"

Realization struck. "The Sinclairs? They're targeting me?"

"Not entirely hopeless." Adrian swirled his wine. "Mr. Vanderbilt's crimes aside, the Sinclairs had no reason to come after him. Which means—their real target was always you."

"Me?" Panic flashed across her face as she stood, knocking over her chair.

"Now, dear sister, you're surrounded. Even if you grovel at that conference, what will it change? The Sinclairs won't stop. Targeting your man was just the beginning."

Margaret clutched her head, screaming hysterically.

Adrian watched, amused.

"No! It wasn't me! It was my brother! They can't do this!"

Babbling, she stormed out.

Moments later, Harrison entered, pouring Adrian another drink.

"Mr. Lockwood, what's that lunatic up to now?"

"If I had to guess? Charging straight to the Sinclairs."

"What?" Harrison gaped. "After the fallout with Vanderbilt Industries, she's provoking them? That'll only make things worse!"

"Let her. Whatever mess she makes is hers alone." Adrian smirked. "Hatred consumes her. When it peaks—she'll be a bomb waiting to explode. And some people are in for a rude awakening."
###Chapter 502

Margaret Laurent, driven by Isabella Sinclair's taunts and a belly full of liquid courage, stormed toward Skyrim under the cover of darkness.

Alexander Kingsley was home that evening, with Olivia Bennett administering his medications while Sophia Reynolds monitored his blood pressure.

These past few days, Isabella had managed to send Alexander's blood pressure skyrocketing. Yet even as the formidable Chairman of the Vanderbilt Group, he couldn't locate his elusive daughter.

Days slipped by, and his initial fury had mellowed into mere concern for his daughter's safety, his emotions gradually stabilizing.

He relentlessly questioned Sebastian Lockwood and others for any news about Isabella, but they maintained an ironclad silence. After all, Sebastian and Nathaniel Hawthorne knew Alexander's outbursts stemmed from deep paternal love. They reasoned that as long as Alexander remained preoccupied with worry for her, his bitterness toward Dominic Vanderbilt might lessen.

"Alexander, I'm not trying to alarm you," Sophia said as she packed away the blood pressure monitor, her brow furrowed with concern. "You keep joking about being half in the grave, but I know you better than that. You want to live long enough to see your children happy and grandchildren playing at your feet. But if you keep neglecting your health like this, I fear that day may never come."

Alexander pressed his lips together, looking every bit the chastened schoolboy.

Olivia chuckled helplessly from the sidelines.

Sophia was the only person whose words could truly reach Alexander. Perhaps it was her commanding presence.

"I feel weaker by the day, and it's all because of that damn girl Isabella! One of these days, she'll be the death of me. Then she can spend every day wrapped around that scoundrel Dominic, popping out a whole litter of—"

His tirade cut off abruptly as his heart clenched, the words dying on his lips.

The quiet study filled with a somber atmosphere.

"Alexander, never speak such words in front of Isabella," Sophia's voice turned stern. "You may be a lion in the boardroom, but don't you dare bring that disrespect into this family. Otherwise, you're nothing but a cantankerous old man who's lost all sense of decency."

Alexander's lips thinned into a tight line, his face etched with defiance.

"Isabella's already suffering enough."

Sophia's eyes reddened as she took a steadying breath. "As her family, we should be supporting her. Not venting our frustrations without considering her feelings, stabbing her in the heart. Alexander, I've been with you from the beginning. I've watched Isabella grow into the strong, remarkable woman she is today. She's never asked you for anything, has she?"

Alexander paled, the tension in his lips betraying his inner turmoil.

"She's never asked you for anything, and now all she wants is Dominic. Why can't you grant her that?" Sophia's voice broke with emotion as she spoke, her own heart aching.

"She's throwing her life away for that boy! If I stand by and watch her ruin herself, what kind of father does that make me?" Alexander's heart softened even as his stubbornness held firm.

"But Isabella has never truly been happy until now."

Sophia's voice trembled. "It's only when she's with Dominic that I can see genuine happiness radiating from her."

"But—"

"Alexander, do you remember what Eleanor told you on her deathbed?"

A shiver ran down Alexander's spine at the memory.

Of course he remembered.

Even if he lost his sight and speech, even if his mind failed him, he would never forget her face, her laughter. On his own deathbed, memories of their time together would bring a youthful smile to his aged face.

"I've never lived a moment for myself."

"I hope our children, especially Isabella, can live freely. Not like me, but with the power to chase their own happiness."

Their own happiness.

He thought, "Eleanor, but is the happiness our daughter chose truly right for her? What should I do? If you're watching over us, send me a sign."

At that moment, a sharp knock at the study door interrupted his thoughts.

Before Alexander could respond, Vanessa Wright burst in, her voice ringing clear. "Alexander, Sophia! That wildcat from the Sterling family is here making a scene, demanding to see you and Natalie! I didn't let her in. She's out front causing a ruckus, reeking of alcohol like some drunken harlot!"

"Victoria Sterling? What does she want?" Alexander exhaled in frustration.

"What kind of upbringing is that? A young woman showing up unannounced at our door at night, treating the Sinclair estate like some public square? Where are their manners?"

Vanessa crossed her arms in annoyance. "I asked her what she wanted, but she's so drunk she can't string two words together. Keeps babbling about how it's not her fault, but who knows what she's on about."

"Not her fault? The audacity!" Sophia's eyes narrowed as she rose swiftly, the air chilling around her. "Does she think Natalie is some soft-hearted pushover she can manipulate? That she can just pretend nothing happened?"

Alexander looked startled. "Sophia, what exactly is going on?"

"At the gala the other night, Seraphina was nearly compromised by Nathaniel's scheme, and Miss Sterling played no small part in it."

Sophia's eyes blazed with a fury that could have ignited the very air. "Sebastian tried to rush in to get Seraphina, but that witch Victoria and her cronies blocked the door and beat him senseless! His shoulder wound became infected, and he nearly lost sight in his left eye!"

"Lost his sight?" Alexander and Vanessa gaped in shock.

They'd seen Sebastian with his eye bandaged recently but never imagined his injuries were so severe.

"And yet, even then, he didn't think of himself. He and his friends, including Gabrielle, risked everything to pull Seraphina from the lion's den. No sooner had Nathaniel whisked Seraphina away than Victoria appeared to block Sebastian. If that's not tipping off her brother, then what is? She's complicit in all of Nathaniel's dirty deeds. An accomplice to tyranny!"

"That conniving witch! She's not worth the dirt beneath our shoes!" Vanessa's fists clenched so hard her knuckles cracked, itching to call Preston again. "This is absolutely despicable!"

Alexander raged, his forehead throbbing with anger as he grabbed an antique vase and hurled it against the wall. "The Sterling brood is nothing but rotten to the core—full of malice!"

"How dare that shameless hussy bully my godson? I'll give her a piece of my mind!"

Before he could storm off, the two women restrained him.

"Alexander, she's not worth your time. You're a man of stature; no need to stoop to her level. She doesn't even deserve your attention." Sophia's gaze darkened as she turned to Vanessa. "Vanessa, have the butler throw her out. We can't let that filth upset Natalie and Seraphina, nor taint the air of Silveke Harbor."

In the yard, Victoria was relentless, tugging at the butler like a fishwife, insisting on seeing Alexander and Natalie.

The butler initially treated her with courtesy but eventually lost patience. A firm shove sent her sprawling!

"Ah!"

Already unsteady, Victoria's legs gave out, landing her on her backside with her skirt flipped up in a most undignified display.

The butler quickly averted his eyes, not wanting to be cursed with the sight.

Just then—

A bucket of yellowish, foul-smelling liquid descended from above, drenching Victoria from head to toe, sending a chill to her bones.

The sour stench hit her nostrils, and she nearly vomited up her last meal.

"What is that smell?"

Sour and putrid enough to make her gag.

"Who? Who did this? WHO?" Victoria howled like an enraged banshee.

"Well, who told you to come here making a scene?" Vanessa emerged from the front door, chin held high, stride confident. "Looks like heaven itself can't stand you, giving you a splash of water to sober up, shut your trap, and scurry back where you came from."

"It was you! YOU did this!" Victoria shivered as the cold wind bit at her soaked skin.

"And what makes you think it was me? Rain falls from the sky; why can't a shower of sewage? Some people reap what they sow. Wouldn't surprise me if one day they're struck by lightning just crossing the street."

Vanessa hadn't lost her taste for the sharp tang of sauerkraut, which she fermented in her cellar.

And there it was—last year's batch of sauerkraut brine, coming in handy.

She'd considered using actual manure but thought better of sullying her own doorstep over this trash. So she'd held back.

"Sewage? Oh." Victoria turned as white as a sheet, retching uncontrollably.

"You know what you've done. We could've taken you to task, but you should've stayed quietly in your hole instead of making a scene at our doorstep. Mr. Sinclair doesn't even deign to see your father anymore, let alone you. Scram before you embarrass yourself further." Vanessa pinched her nose, eyes filled with disgust.

Realizing she'd humiliated herself and gained nothing, Victoria spat on the ground in fury.

With no choice but to leave the Sinclair estate in a smelly, defeated state, she trudged away.

"I see."

As Sophia finished her story, Alexander connected the dots. "I was wondering why the Sterlings were suddenly in the clear, only for the finger to point at Jeffrey. So it was Dominic's doing?"

"Indeed, Mr. Vanderbilt orchestrated it. He did it to avenge Seraphina, to show the Sterlings that none of our children can be trifled with."

Alexander's expression softened as he pondered.

Sophia watched him closely, sensing a subtle shift in his attitude toward Dominic.

This had been Isabella's assignment two days prior when she'd called. Her task: find an opportunity to inform Alexander about the Sterlings' downfall and Reginald's arrest, crediting all to Dominic to salvage his reputation.

Initially, Sophia had worried how to broach the subject.

But Victoria's uninvited appearance tonight provided the perfect segue.

"Hmm. Wait a minute."

Alexander's brow furrowed again. "That doesn't add up. Harrison was the one who made the arrest. If Dominic was behind it all, why would Harrison act? I'd believe it if you said Isabella arranged it. Besides, this style of letting someone live in misery doesn't seem like Dominic. It's more Isabella's approach."

Sophia's eyes flickered uncertainly as she slipped her arm through Alexander's. "Alexander, it's late. You should rest."

These days, Isabella had been avoiding Alexander's visits to her Elmsworth home, refusing to stay in a hotel, instead living with Dominic at Preston and Natalie's love nest.

Natalie was thrilled. She adored her sister-in-law and had missed her terribly during their separation. Now with the chance, she stuck to Isabella like glue, becoming her shadow.

This left Dominic with only the nights to spend alone with his beloved.

Every night, he'd wrap himself around her in bed, relentless until she was utterly exhausted, pleading for mercy beneath him. As if determined to reclaim every moment of intimacy lost during the day.

Isabella was at her wit's end.

She'd seen nitpickers, but never one who counted every touch and caress in the bedroom.

Her first attempt at baking a cake was thwarted by Nathaniel's unexpected visit. Tonight was rare—everyone home. Natalie, donning a pink apron, eager to show off, planned to bake a grand cake for her sister-in-law and older brother.

Isabella had gone to bed early, flipping through channels, waiting.

But as night deepened and her stomach rumbled, there was still no activity from Natalie's end.

Unable to resist curiosity, Isabella descended to investigate.

Just as she reached the living room, before even making it to the kitchen, she froze at the sight—

Preston had Natalie pinned against the countertop, her delicate wrists gripped above her head as he devoured her lush lips with near-animalistic kisses, tangled deep and passionate.

Natalie surrendered to his advances, soft moans escaping her throat.

And at that moment, as Preston lost himself completely, he lifted the girl's slender left leg.

Isabella thought, "Oh my! The little bunny's about to be devoured by the big bad wolf!"

Her mouth fell open in shock, cheeks flushing, heart racing!

As she stood frozen, unsure what to do, strong arms embraced her from behind, masculine scent enveloping her.

"Don't be so startled, Isabella. This happens here daily," Dominic whispered near her reddened ear, eyes soft. "Let them be, let them move at their own rhythm. We shouldn't disturb them. Alright?"

"But, but— Ah!"

Isabella melted helplessly into his embrace, torn between laughter and tears. "Oh well, my little girl's all grown up, becoming a real woman. That rascal Preston's in for quite the night! Lucky him, hmph!"

Dominic's body tensed suddenly, breath deepening as he scooped her up. "Isabella, we too must make every second count."

She clung to his neck, heart fluttering, cheeks deepening to crimson. "Wh-what are you doing?"

He brushed his lips against her forehead repeatedly, voice a deep growl.

"You know it."
###Chapter 503

The press conference day arrived in the blink of an eye.

At precisely five o'clock, media outlets from across the city gathered in the grand ballroom of The Regal Palace. Cameras were set up, angles adjusted, laptops opened—all waiting for Margaret Laurent's appearance.

"Damn, I thought Nathan or Theodore would be handling this mess, not Margaret. This woman's got nerves of steel—her husband's locked up, and she still has the energy for a press conference? Does she even sleep?"

"The Laurent men are cunning. They're using Margaret as a shield, making her the target!"

"Tsk, tsk, no love lost in that family. Poor Margaret."

"Poor? Harrison's shady deals made millions—enough to keep him in prison for life. You think she didn't get a cut? Please. It's every man for himself now!"

Seven o'clock struck.

Margaret walked onto the stage like a grieving widow, her face bare of makeup. Dressed in a somber black suit, she faced the forest of microphones.

The blinding flashes swallowed her exhausted features as she bowed deeply to the cameras, her eyes red-rimmed with tears.

The reporters fired their sharp questions.

"Margaret! The nation is shocked by Harrison's sudden arrest, especially since he was a frontrunner for Elmsworth's mayoral race. Did you know about his actions?"

"I didn't know."

Tears welled in her eyes as she played the innocent wife. "I'm just a housewife, devoted to my husband and children. I never pried into his work. As for who he met privately, the bribes he took—I knew nothing! Besides, I'm a Laurent, one of the elite families. I don't need dirty money at the cost of my conscience!"

"Do you truly claim ignorance of Mr. Laurent's deeds?"

A male reporter stepped forward, his voice cutting through the noise. "Everyone knows how Mr. Laurent rose from an average prosecutor to a mayoral candidate with an extraordinary career. Surely, the Laurent family supported him! I've interviewed employees who worked closely with you both—they say you were the mastermind behind his every move. You pulled strings, leveraging your family's influence. Are you truly blameless?"

Margaret glared at him, tears streaming as she shook her head. "That's a lie! I don't know which outlet you're from, but you're attacking me with baseless rumors. I knew nothing! But as his wife, I admit I failed to supervise him. That's why I called this press conference—to apologize for his mistakes."

Before she could finish, the reporter played a recording.

It was a confession from one of Harrison's employees, backing the reporter's claims!

The crowd turned skeptical eyes on Margaret, waiting for her explanation.

"He's lying! That's a traitor taking advantage!"

Margaret's legs trembled uncontrollably behind the table, her face draining of color. Under the pressure, she was close to collapse. "He's smearing me! When my husband fell, he was bought off! Who is this person? If he dares to speak, he should dare to name himself! I'll sue—"

A piercing shriek cut her off.

Then, a crystal-clear recording played for all to hear—

—"Clairvoyant, the girls you've been sending me lately are exquisite. Our clients are more than pleased. Their fortunes align well—these powerful men are superstitious. Otherwise, how would your business thrive?"

—"My thriving business owes much to your patronage, Mrs. Laurent! You've introduced many generous clients."

—"Mutual benefits, right? Send more suitable girls my way. Price is negotiable."

The audio struck the audience like a hammer to their beliefs.

The crowd erupted, their gazes at Margaret now filled with disgust.

Who would've thought this elegant socialite was involved in such filth?

The Laurent family had nurtured a nest of maggots!

"No! That's not me!" Margaret's face burned red, her voice hysterical. "The recording is fake! I don't know any clairvoyant! That's not my voice! Someone's framing me!"

"Framing you?" The reporter raised his phone high. "Then explain this."

At that moment, every journalist's phone buzzed.

They all looked down—news alerts showed a video of Margaret meeting the so-called clairvoyant, handing over cash.

Her crimes were now exposed for all to see!

"Miss Laurent!"

A security guard rushed to the stage, grabbing her stiff form. "I was sent by Mr. Laurent—the situation's dire. We need to leave now!"

Before he could finish, the ballroom doors burst open.

Aaron Ashbourne stormed in, flanked by plainclothes officers, his presence silencing the room.

"Police!"

He flashed his badge. "Margaret Laurent, you're under arrest for bribery, coercion, and illegal detention. You have the right to remain silent. Take her away!"

Two officers clamped icy handcuffs on her shaking wrists, dragging the petrified woman out.

The live broadcast had just hit ten million viewers.

[Oh my God! High society is this cutthroat? A heiress running an escort ring? Unreal!]

[The Laurents pretending to be elite while rubbing shoulders with the Ashbournes? Pathetic!]

[Karma's a beast! Look at Margaret flopping like her husband did when he got arrested! Perfect match!]

[Disgusting! I hope they dig deeper—bet there's more!]

[Did anyone see that cop leading the charge? Damn, he's gorgeous! Like a model!]

Aaron didn't bother hiding Margaret's cuffed wrists as he shoved her into the patrol car.

Wealth offered no immunity.

The elite faced justice like everyone else.

Meanwhile, the reporter who'd cornered Margaret slipped into a secluded corner, stripping off glasses, a wig, and a fake beard.

Underneath, Gordon's earnest face was revealed.

Dumping his disguise, he eagerly dialed Thaddeus.

"Mr. Abernathy! Did you and Mrs. Abernathy see the press conference? How'd I do?"

"Mrs. Abernathy says your acting was flawless. You've earned an extra drumstick tonight."

A kiss sounded through the phone, making Gordon blush. "Th-thanks, Mrs. Abernathy! So, Mr. Abernathy... my reward?"

"A reward? Isn't this your job as a secretary?" Thaddeus's voice was lazy, satisfied.

Gordon panicked. "But Mrs. Abernathy rewarded me! You wouldn't want her to think you're stingy, right?"

"Who are you threatening?"

"No! I wouldn't dare!" Gordon straightened, sweating.

"You've worked hard. Take ten extra vacation days."

"Uh... Mr. Abernathy, I'm a bachelor. Even if you gave me maternity leave, I'd have nothing to do!" He joked. "How about a bonus instead? I'll skip holidays—loyal as a dog to you both!"

"Making a million a year and still not satisfied? Who at Abernathy Group earns more than you?"

Thaddeus scoffed. "What breed of dog has skin this thick?"

"Mr. Abernathy, I may be single now, but I need to save for a wedding! I work day and night—FBI-level dedication! No time for love. Have a heart for this lonely bachelor!"

Before Thaddeus could answer, Evadne's sweet voice chimed in. "Mr. Abernathy, don't be stingy. Gordon never asks for anything. Just say yes!"

Gordon grinned. That soft voice could melt anyone.

Thaddeus's breathing grew heavier. "Fine, fine. Whatever my darling wants."

The call dropped.

Gordon scratched his head. "So... is my bonus raised or not?"

Back in the police car, Aaron sat shotgun as they sped toward the station.

Margaret had dropped all pretense, shrieking like a banshee.

"How dare you arrest me? Do you know who I am? I'm a Laurent! My father is Jeff Laurent! You think you ants can touch me? I'll have your badges stripped!"

Aaron snorted, flicking away her nonsense like earwax.

The officer restraining her tightened his grip. "Keep it down, or I'll add assaulting an officer to your charges!"

"Think I'm scared of you?"

Unable to move her arms, Margaret kicked Aaron's seat like a wild animal. "Which precinct are you from? State your name! My family will make you regret this!"

"Can't wait," Aaron drawled. "Tell your dad and brother to hurry. I'm looking forward to it."

He turned leisurely, lips curving into a smirk. "My name's Aaron Ashbourne."

Margaret's eyes widened in shock, a chill running down her spine.
###Chapter 504

The cozy suburban home was bathed in the warm glow of the evening.

Two couples lounged in the living room, their attention fixed on the breaking news broadcast.

The headline dominated every channel - Margaret Laurent had been arrested!

The screen showed footage of Margaret being escorted by police, her once-proud demeanor now reduced to a pitiful spectacle.

"Wait...that officer looks familiar," Isabella murmured, tapping her chin thoughtfully. Her eyes suddenly lit up with recognition. "Oh! He was sitting next to me at Vanessa's birthday gala. We even had a lovely conversation about-"

Before she could finish, Alexander's expression darkened. He captured her chin possessively, silencing her with a deep kiss that radiated jealousy.

Nearby, Eleanor and Nathaniel were engrossed in the news when the sudden intimate sounds caught their attention. Nathaniel instinctively shifted his broad frame to block their view, then pulled Eleanor into an equally passionate embrace.

"What's this? Too scandalous for my innocent eyes?" Eleanor teased, pouting playfully. "I've seen plenty in my time. It's just a kiss, after all."

"Merely sparing you the awkwardness," Nathaniel countered, pinching her nose affectionately.

Across the room, Alexander finally broke the kiss, leaving Isabella breathless and flushed. His eyes burned with intensity.

"Darling, are you trying to provoke me by mentioning another man?" His thumb traced her swollen lips. "Handsome officer? More handsome than your husband?"

Isabella blushed crimson. "Well...you're both attractive in different ways."

Alexander arched an eyebrow dangerously. "Different how?"

"You! Definitely you!" Isabella giggled uncontrollably as he tickled her, melting into his embrace.

Eleanor rested her head on Nathaniel's shoulder, casting a knowing glance at Alexander. "If not for love being blind, the jury might still be out on that one."

Alexander's heart pounded like a drumbeat.

Everyone knew how protective Eleanor was of Isabella. If he hadn't claimed her first, who knew which of the Sinclair brothers Eleanor might have matched her with?

The thought made him clutch Isabella's hand tighter, as if someone might snatch her away.

The news report continued, revealing that Jeffrey had been rushed to the hospital under mysterious circumstances.

No explanation needed - undoubtedly stress-related!

The camera cut to Matthew Chambers, CEO of the Vanderbilt Group, besieged by reporters outside the hospital. His grim expression suggested he'd aged a decade overnight.

"Now this is better than any primetime drama!" Alexander declared, slapping his thigh in satisfaction while keeping Isabella close.

Isabella offered him a lick of her strawberry popsicle, which he accepted with a tender smile, his fingers gently stroking her hair.

"With Margaret arrested for trafficking and her husband for...unconventional marital activities, they truly deserve each other," Eleanor remarked disdainfully, watching Matthew's pale face on screen. "The Vanderbilt empire is crumbling. It's only a matter of time before prosecutors come knocking."

Nathaniel nodded in agreement. "Jeffrey's sudden hospitalization is likely just a ploy to avoid questioning."

"The cunning old fox!" Alexander spat through gritted teeth.

"Alexander," Isabella asked with innocent curiosity, "what exactly is a threesome?"

The room fell silent.

Alexander cleared his throat awkwardly. "Ahem. That's a...private discussion for later. Behind closed doors."

As the news segment ended, the Vanderbilt scandal had dominated nearly half the broadcast - a fitting spectacle for their love of ostentation.

"It's horrifying what they did to those women!" Isabella's eyes welled with angry tears. "They deserve the harshest punishment!"

"They've been caught, darling," Alexander soothed, pulling her closer.

A solemn quiet settled over the room.

Though Margaret had been arrested, Byron - who had wronged Natalie - remained free, his crimes unpunished.

And as for Adrian, that venomous snake...he was a problem that required special handling.

Their campaign against the Vanderbilt Group was only beginning.

Nathaniel noticed Eleanor's pensive expression and squeezed her shoulder reassuringly. "You've done brilliantly, Eleanor. The Vanderbilts are one of the elite families - deeply entrenched. Uprooting them takes time. Leave Byron to me."

"No," Eleanor's eyes glinted coldly. "We won't need to lift a finger. Someone else will take out the trash for us."

Alexander frowned. "Who?"

Nathaniel's eyebrows rose in understanding. "You mean Adrian?"

"My brilliant husband," Eleanor purred, looping her arms around his neck. "Exactly."

"But he's a Vanderbilt!" Alexander protested. "With the family in crisis, why would he-"

"Adrian and his mother were exiled to the outskirts of Seattle for fifteen years," Nathaniel explained smoothly. "Jeffrey treated them as non-existent. Adrian craves power like a starving man craves food, and his mother suffers advanced Alzheimer's. Can you imagine the resentment festering all these years? Would you feel any loyalty?"

"Take over Vanderbilt Group? That's biting off more than he can chew!" Alexander scoffed.

"If the Vanderbilts stood united, he wouldn't stand a chance," Eleanor said darkly. "But divided as they are, he'll seize this opportunity to eliminate his obstacles - first Byron, then Matthew. With no one left to support Jeffrey, the empire falls right into Adrian's lap."

Nathaniel chuckled darkly. "Precisely. Classic Adrian strategy."

"So we wait and counter whatever comes our way," Eleanor concluded confidently, linking arms with Nathaniel. "Our inaction will force Adrian's hand against Byron."

The next day, the stock market opened to disaster.

Vanderbilt Group shares plummeted, painting trading boards a sickly green. The scandal fermented, corporate unrest grew.

By the third day, Jeffrey remained "ill" in hospital while Matthew faced prosecutors.

On the fourth day, Reginald was cornered by press demanding his take on the Vanderbilt crisis.

"Mr. Sinclair, given your close ties with Mr. Vanderbilt, what's your perspective on their current predicament?"

Reginald's expression remained cool. "Mr. Vanderbilt and I were business associates, nothing more. As for my opinion? When you make your bed, you lie in it. Let's hope the Vanderbilt Group learns from this."

Jeffrey, watching from his hospital bed, shattered the television with a chair.

Days passed with no further moves from Eleanor and Nathaniel.

Just as predicted, Adrian's patience wore thin.

Originally planning to use proxies, he now had to act directly or lose his chance.

That night, cloaked in darkness, Adrian followed Harvey's trail to the detention center.

The once-pampered Margaret now sat disheveled behind glass, her face a patchwork of bruises - even fellow inmates despised her crimes.

"Dear sister," Adrian greeted with mocking sweetness. "How fares the fallen queen?"

"Drop the act, you viper!" Margaret snarled, eyes wild. "Father and Matthew will get me out! When I'm free, I'll tear out your throat!"

Adrian chuckled darkly. "Still clinging to Vanderbilt men? How naïve. If they cared, you wouldn't be here." He adjusted his glasses smugly. "Ironically, I'm the only one who visited."

Margaret's face contorted with dawning horror.

He was right.

With their influence, why hadn't they helped? Their silence...were they sacrificing her?

"Damn them all!" Margaret shrieked, prompting guards to restrain her.

Adrian's smile widened behind feigned concern. "Since they've abandoned you...perhaps I can exact some revenge on your behalf?"
###Chapter 505

Margaret's face twisted with fury, her gaze drilling into Isabella's delicate yet infuriating features.

"Help me? They're all monsters, but what about you, Isabella? Aren't you one of them? Oh no, you're worse—you're the devil himself! More vicious than any of them!"

Isabella remained unshaken, her smile only widening. "I may not be a saint, but even beasts have moments of tenderness with their young. I can't bring myself to be too cruel to my own sister. So, I thought I'd offer you a hand, sis. Besides, who else would bother visiting you in this wretched place? Do you really think you're still part of the Sinclair family?"

Seeing Margaret's resistance to her so-called "help," Isabella pressed further.

"Margaret, have you ever stopped to wonder who truly brought you and your husband to this miserable state?"

Margaret's rage erupted as she screamed, "The Kingsley family! It's the Kingsleys taking revenge on me! That wretched Evelyn can't escape me!"

Isabella's lips curled into a cold smirk as she shook her head. "You crossed Emeric's own daughter. That old man spared you out of respect for the decades-long ties between our families. But didn't all of this start because of Nathan?"

"Nathan." The name buzzed in Margaret's mind.

In her days of seething, she had been fixated on the Kingsleys, nearly forgetting that spineless coward!

"Nathan lured you into the Kingsleys' crosshairs. If he hadn't been so arrogant from the start, you and your husband would still be living in luxury. Now, he's ruined everything. From the press conference to your imprisonment, did he ever defend you? He let you take the fall while he hides safely under the Sinclair family's protection, still playing the role of Mr. Sinclair. Are you really going to let him get away with that? I can't bear to see you like this, Margaret."

Reason and emotion—that was how to break her.

Margaret fell silent, clearly plotting her next move, but the hatred in her eyes burned brighter.

"What do you suggest we do?"

"That depends on how committed you are to working with me," Isabella said, stretching comfortably, her legs crossed. The ball was in her court now.

Margaret's eyes were bloodshot as she ground out each word, nearly crushing her teeth. "I want him dead!"

"Death is too easy, too quick. He'd escape suffering."

Isabella leaned closer to the glass, a sinister smile playing on her lips. "You need him to beg for death but be unable to achieve it. Make him live every day hating you, powerless to act. That's true satisfaction."

"I have dirt on Nathan. It's in an encrypted folder on my laptop in the study. The password is—"

"No need for passwords."

Isabella stood gracefully, satisfied with the outcome, looking down at Margaret's furious face. "Your so-called encryption is child's play to me."

As she left the detention center, Harvey rushed to her side.

Isabella lazily extended her hands, which Harvey promptly sanitized before spritzing her with a freshening spray.

"It's disgusting in there. No place for humans."

Isabella frowned, vigorously rubbing her hands, her germaphobia flaring. "Though, it's the perfect environment for maggots like Margaret."

"You honored her with your presence. That's more than she deserves."

Harvey hesitated before asking, "Mr. Sinclair, will that madwoman cooperate with you?"

"When I step in, failure isn't an option," Isabella said with an arrogant lift of her brow.

"Then early congratulations are in order—another thorn removed from your side."

Harvey's smile was sycophantic. "Once Nathan falls, what about Matthew? When your father runs out of options, he'll have no choice but to rely on you. The entire Sinclair Group will be yours."

"Hopefully."

Isabella's eyes gleamed with complex emotions as she gazed at the darkening sky. "My father has done so much for me. I only hope to live up to his expectations."

"Mr. Sinclair, I've just received word that your private jet is ready."

"It's been a wait, but worth it."

Isabella adjusted her sunglasses, a cold glint in her eyes. "Contact Eden. Tell him everything is set. We can send him and his brothers off at any time."

Isabella's luxury car glided toward The Velvet Haven.

She couldn't help but smile at the thought of the coming events and her grand designs for the future.

Everything was under her control.

Except for Evelyn.

At the thought, Isabella clenched her fist in frustration. "I told you to keep an eye on the Kingsleys. Any news?"

Harvey wiped his forehead, remembering. "Our men found out Ms. Kingsley has fled the family. Chairman Kingsley is searching everywhere for her, but she's still missing!"

"What? Evelyn ran away from home? Why didn't you tell me sooner?" Isabella leaned forward, her eyes narrowing with urgency.

"Mr. Sinclair, please! The Kingsleys are tight-lipped. Our men have been staking out day and night to get this information!" Harvey looked genuinely worried.

Isabella removed her sunglasses, pinching the bridge of her nose. "I remember when Evelyn was a child, climbing walls and trees just to sneak out and play."

"I can't believe she's still so rebellious as an adult. And Emeric, knowing how headstrong she is, thought grounding her would work? That's like caging a wild bird."

"I wonder how Ms. Kingsley is doing now. But with her intelligence and ability to stand out, no one can push her around."

"The Kingsley brothers would never let their beloved sister wander alone. If Emeric can't find her, they certainly will."

Isabella adjusted her sunglasses, but before she could finish, her gaze caught a startling scene outside the window.

"Stop the car!"

Harvey slammed on the brakes, sweat beading on his forehead.

Isabella pressed her palm against the window, her breath fogging the glass in quick, fervent gasps. Yet it couldn't obscure the striking figure that pierced her gaze.

Across the street, in front of a street food cart serving hot dogs and pretzels—

A couple stood shoulder to shoulder, leaning over their food, laughing and sharing smiles.

It was Evelyn and Alexander!

Who would have thought the haughty billionaire, who prided himself on refined tastes, would stoop to sharing street food with his beloved? The man who indulged only in the finest cuisine was now devouring late-night snacks—even letting Evelyn feed him a greasy corn dog!

Anyone witnessing this would think it a fairy tale, thrilling yet baffling.

"Is it good?" Evelyn's smile bloomed like a flower as she tenderly wiped his lips with a napkin.

No sooner had his mouth been cleaned than he couldn't resist stealing a kiss from her rosy lips. "Delicious. Anything tastes like heaven when I'm with you."

His voice was loud, making Evelyn blush. Even the elderly woman making the hot dogs couldn't help but smile.

Such a handsome man, such a beautiful woman—a match made in heaven, their love as endless as the stars.

Who wouldn't smile at such a sight?

"Pssh. So you're saying it only tastes good because it's with me?"

Evelyn feigned annoyance, pouting slightly. "If you don't like it, just say so. I don't want you forcing yourself to please me. I won't bring you here again."

Alexander's lashes fluttered as his long arm reached across her, grabbing two bottles from the far end of the table—one pepper, the other vinegar.

He meticulously added them to Evelyn's soup, stirring gently before urging softly, "Try it now."

Evelyn blinked her almond-shaped eyes, took a sip, and suddenly widened them in surprise.

"Oh my! This is amazing! Such a simple change, but it transforms everything. How are you so clever?"

Alexander gazed at her deeply, his smile shy, as if he were a teenager again. "Evelyn, you think I say it's delicious just to please you, but you're wrong. Before I was taken back into the Abernathy family, these humble food carts were my mother's and my greatest joy."

A pang shot through Evelyn's heart.

She thought she knew much of his past from Alva, but now she realized it was only the tip of the iceberg.

Unless he told her himself, there were things she might never know—let alone imagine.

The street food that was a mere diversion in her life had been a daily comfort for the young Alexander.

"As a child, after helping my mother with chores, I'd always be starving. She'd take me to a cart for a hot dog and soup," Alexander said, idly spinning the cup in his hands, lost in memories. "To save money, she'd only order one for me, but it always had meat. Afraid I'd find it bland, she'd create her own seasonings. My favorite was pepper and vinegar—sour and spicy, so satisfying. As I grew up, every time I ate from a cart, I'd do the same. But now, I no longer have the chance to savor those childhood flavors."

A poignant silence filled the air.

Alexander snapped back to the present, his smile apologetic. "I'm sorry, Evelyn. Here I am, ruining our meal with these stories."

And with that, Evelyn's eyes brimmed with tears as she cupped his face and kissed him.
###Chapter 506

Sebastian's pupils dilated, an electric current of desire surging through his veins.

His calloused fingers traced the delicate curve of her neck, pulling her closer, claiming her lips with unrestrained hunger.

The elderly vendor averted her gaze, busying herself with wiping down the counter, unwilling to intrude on the intimate moment unfolding before her.

But that tender kiss was a dagger to Nathaniel's heart, twisting his insides into agonizing knots.

It felt like a jagged blade had been plunged into his chest, bitterness and despair gushing forth like a crimson tide, staining everything in its wake.

Harrison, standing nearby, exhaled sharply through his nose.

Love was the one thing in this world that couldn't be bought, no matter how much wealth or cunning one possessed.

Nathaniel had sacrificed everything for this woman, yet Isabella still threw herself into Sebastian's arms without hesitation!

A rose nurtured by poison, thriving in decay!

When Isabella finally broke the kiss, her cheeks were flushed, her voice thick with emotion. "Sebastian, you've endured so much. But it's over now. Our future is bright."

"With you by my side, every day feels like a dream," Sebastian murmured, pulling her into his embrace, his eyes alight with visions of their shared tomorrow.

Romance had never come naturally to him—he wasn't the type for sweet nothings.

But for Isabella, he was willing to learn.

She nestled against his chest, listening to the steady rhythm of his heartbeat, tears welling in her eyes.

"Isabella, are you crying?" Sebastian asked, startled.

"This is your fault," she mumbled into his shirt.

His pulse stuttered. "Why? Feeling sorry for me?"

She didn’t answer, but the glistening trails on her cheeks spoke volumes.

"Sweetheart, don’t cry. Hardship only makes me stronger."

Sebastian couldn’t describe the storm of emotions inside him—guilt, sorrow, but also overwhelming gratitude. "Isabella, do you know? Every day, I thank fate for sparing me in Zenithia. If I’d died there, I never would’ve met you."

The night was serene, stars shimmering above as a gentle breeze wrapped around the entwined couple.

Unseen by them, a sleek black car idled across the street, its occupant seething with envy.

"Mr. Kingsley, it's late. We should return," Harrison urged, wiping sweat from his brow.

Nathaniel looked hollow, slumping back into his seat. His bloodshot eyes closed as he removed his gold-rimmed glasses.

A sharp snap echoed through the car.

"Mr. Kingsley!" Harrison gasped.

Nathaniel had crushed the frames in his fist, shards biting into his palm. Blood dripped between his fingers, vanishing into the shadows.

Harrison’s stomach lurched.

Those glasses had been Nathaniel’s constant companion since the day Harrison had entered his service.

Now, they lay shattered—just like Nathaniel’s restraint.

"You said Emeric found no trace of Isabella? Funny. Here she is," Nathaniel muttered darkly, pulling out his phone to dial Emeric.

The Next Day

After hours of grueling interrogation, Matthew stumbled out of the prosecutor’s office, exhaustion weighing him down.

But before he could even shower, Jeff summoned him to the hospital.

The moment Jeff learned the family had lost two hundred million in days, he erupted, demolishing the hospital room with the fury of a caged beast.

The money was secondary.

The real blow was the scandal halting their Helgen project, with government officials now scrutinizing their finances.

"Father, calm down. Your health—" Matthew rasped, his unshaven face haggard, his hair greasy. "We can recover the money, but if this scandal isn’t contained—"

"Recover it? With what?" Jeff snarled, standing amid the wreckage. "Two hundred million, plus the overseas projects frozen—we’re down nearly a billion! When will you earn that back?"

Matthew’s jaw clenched.

Then, a smooth voice cut through the tension.

"Don’t worry, Father."

Avery strolled in, his smile effortless. "I can fix this."

Jeff’s eyes widened. "You?"

Matthew’s glare could’ve melted steel.

Damn pretty boy. In another era, he’d be nothing but a eunuch.

"I’ve been building connections abroad," Avery said, patting Jeff’s shoulder. "Fifteen years in Helgen wasn’t wasted. Getting approvals is child’s play."

Jeff gripped his arm. "You’re serious?"

Avery met his gaze, inwardly sneering.

His entire life, Jeff had belittled him—useless, worthless. Now, desperation made him cling like a drowning man.

Memories flashed: kneeling in snow at eight, Byron and Bertha pouring ice water down his back, his fever burning for days while his mother wept silently.

And Matthew? Smirking.

One day, he’d make them all beg.

"Of course, Father," Avery said, eyes gleaming with false humility. "But how should I present myself? I hold no position in the company."

Jeff didn’t hesitate. "Starting tomorrow, you’re Executive Director. Get Helgen back on track, and I’ll transfer Bertha’s shares to you—plus five percent more."

Matthew’s face drained of color.

Avery smiled. "Thank you, Father."

Before Jeff could reply, his secretary burst in. "Sir! Byron’s been arrested!"

Jeff and Matthew froze.

Only Avery’s lips curled in satisfaction.

Byron, high out of his mind, had been dragged from a party mid-orgy, assaulting officers while screaming about his "rights."

Now, shirtless and delirious, he wailed to the press: "I couldn’t rape anyone! I’m impotent!"

Cameras flashed, capturing every humiliating detail.

Then, darkness swallowed him.
###Chapter 507

The arrest of Nathan Prescott was the bombshell dominating headlines nationwide.

As anticipated, the only thing powerful enough to dethrone Margaret Laurent from trending searches was an even more explosive scandal.

But the true devastation unfolded within the Prescott family.

The scandal involving the Prescott siblings had pushed the once-revered dynasty to the brink of ruin. Arrests were damaging enough, but to have their dirty laundry aired on national television? That was a humiliation no amount of wealth could erase.

Watching the live broadcast, Harrison Prescott felt his heart stutter, his face draining of color as his body sagged backward.

"Father!"

Sebastian rushed forward to catch him, but Adrian, standing closer, intercepted him first.

"Father, sit down and breathe," Adrian urged, guiding Harrison to the sofa before shooting Sebastian a pointed look. "Sebastian, what are you waiting for? Call a doctor!"

Sebastian's face flushed crimson with fury, his fingers twitching as if he wanted to tear Adrian's tongue out. "You little—"

"Sebastian, I know you've always resented me," Adrian cut in, his voice laced with feigned concern. "I've never challenged you, never stepped on your toes. But with the family in shambles and Father unwell, my priority is his safety—not arguing with you!" His tone was urgent, but his steel-gray eyes bore into Sebastian with icy precision.

Harrison suddenly roared, his voice cracking like a whip, silencing the room. "Sebastian! You spineless, petty man! Get out! Now!"

The air turned glacial, thick with unspoken tension.

Sebastian's jaw clenched so hard his temples pulsed, his knuckles white. But with Adrian currently in Harrison's good graces, lashing out would only backfire. Swallowing his rage, he stormed out, slamming the door behind him.

"Father, don't be too hard on him," Adrian murmured, his voice dripping with false sympathy as he stoked Harrison's anger. "Think about it. He's been managing the company, overseeing our siblings—it hasn't been easy. With the group in crisis, he's stretched thin. His frustration is understandable. Please don't blame him."

"Margaret and Nathan are in this mess because of his negligence! He spoiled them!" Harrison clutched his chest, his face twisted in anguish. "Has he ever truly handled a crisis as CEO? I trusted him to keep an eye on Nathan, and this is what happens? Useless! If Prescott Holdings' stocks plummet any further, we'll be vulnerable to a hostile takeover. Then we're truly finished!"

"Father, I'll handle the company's issues. You just focus on your health—no more worries." Adrian's voice was soothing, a balm to Harrison's frayed nerves.

"My son, I've wronged you all these years. This family can't survive without you."

Harrison's eyes welled with tears as he gripped Adrian's hand. "From now on, I won't let you down."

On the drive back, Adrian's demeanor shifted. A cold smirk curled his lips.

"Mr. Prescott, I don't understand," Daniel said, frowning.

"With your resources in Helgen, you could easily buy up Prescott Holdings' stocks overnight. Why stabilize the situation instead? Wouldn't chaos benefit you more?"

"I don't hold shares in Prescott Holdings. No matter how many I acquire, I can't outpace Harrison and Sebastian. Acting recklessly now would give my enemies ammunition."

Daniel nodded slowly. "Makes sense. You've just earned the old man's trust, and with the rift you've created between father and son, caution is key."

"Besides, I want to take the throne legitimately—not be branded a traitor or schemer."

Adrian's chin lifted with dark amusement. "What Sebastian cherishes most is his CEO title. If I can personally dethrone him and crush him under my heel, that will be the sweetest revenge."

"Sebastian is already falling out of favor. Your time will come soon enough," Daniel chuckled, sharing in Adrian's triumph.

Adrian closed his eyes, a pang of longing piercing his chest. "Alexander has always been reserved about me and Isabella. He doesn't trust me because I lack a position or shares in Prescott Holdings. I need to take control of the company soon, sever ties with the Prescotts, and prove my worth to Alexander. Only then will Isabella and I have a chance. For her, I'd burn the world. And Prescott Holdings will be my gift to her."

Daniel's phone buzzed urgently.

He glanced at the message and quickly reported, "Mr. Prescott! Our sources say Alexander is on his way to see Ms. Sinclair!"

That evening, as Lucas was summoned by Reginald and Isabella had left with Nathaniel, only Arabella and Lillian remained at home.

Arabella sat in the sunroom Lucas had designed for her, lost in her painting, while Lillian stood nearby, admiring the way the girl's brushstrokes brought the villa's lush summer garden to life.

"Ma'am, you're incredible—this looks like a photograph!"

"Oh, stop. Lillian, you're too kind," Arabella murmured, her cheeks flushing pink.

"No exaggeration, ma'am. I never lie—not to you or Mr. Grant."

Lillian smiled warmly, her sincerity shining through. "Mr. Grant is blessed to have you. Thank you."

Arabella shook her head, her clear eyes sparkling. "I should be thanking Lucas. He's never looked down on me for being... slower. He's always been so kind, keeping me close."

"Ma'am, don't say that."

Lillian knelt beside her, gently taking her paint-stained hand. "No one in this world is more perfect for the young master than you."

Just then, the doorbell rang.

"Oh! Could that be Lucas? I'll go greet him!"

Arabella scampered downstairs like an excited sparrow, reaching the foyer.

Since no outsiders knew their address, she didn't hesitate before flinging open the door and throwing her arms around the man standing there. "Lucas! You're back!"

Silence.

Arabella's eyes flew open. Her nose twitched as she sniffed his chest like a curious puppy.

This wasn't Lucas. Lucas always carried a faint hint of tobacco, but this man smelled only of crisp soap.

"Ms. Sinclair, what are you sniffing for?"

The man's voice was laced with amusement. Arabella yelped, leaping back several feet.

Only then did she realize—the man she'd embraced wasn't Lucas at all!

"You're the guy from the news! Isabella's brother!" Her mouth fell open in shock.

"Hm? You remember me? From the news? When was I on TV?" Adrian leaned slightly forward, hands clasped behind his back, his smile disarmingly warm.

Arabella clapped a hand over her mouth. What had she just done?

Ever since Lucas had been with her, he'd never touched another woman. And now she'd hugged another man?

Was she tainted? Had she betrayed Lucas?

"I'm so, so sorry," she stammered after a long pause, unsure whether she was apologizing to Adrian or Lucas.

"Ms. Sinclair, what are you apologizing for? If anything, I should be the one sorry. I've been so busy I haven't showered in three days. Hope I didn't offend your nose?" Adrian chuckled, thoroughly entertained by her flustered reaction.

"Ma'am!"

Lillian rushed over, freezing at the sight of Adrian. "Mr. Kingsley?"

Adrian was notoriously private, known only to inner circles. Lillian recognized him only because Lucas had mentioned him in passing.

Otherwise, this would've been another awkward encounter like the one with Mr. Whitmore.

"Is Isabella and Nathaniel here?" Adrian peered past them, concerned. The family drama had escalated, and he hadn't seen his sister in days.

"Ms. Sinclair and Mr. Grant are out handling errands," Lillian said hesitantly before stepping aside. "Please, come in and wait."

Adrian settled onto the living room couch, tossing a file about the Seraphina case onto the coffee table.

The trial was approaching, and Isabella and Nathaniel needed to review the details—which was why Isabella had asked him to meet here tonight.

"Nice place. Cozier than our family's mausoleum," Adrian mused, glancing around.

At least Nathaniel hadn't let his sister down.

"Last time a man visited, he said the same thing. He even mentioned buying the house next door to be neighbors," Lillian remarked dryly.

"Who was that?"

"Dominic."

Adrian burst out laughing. "Sounds like Dominic. Always throwing money around. What he spends in a year, I'd need a decade to earn."

Then he noticed Arabella, curled up in the corner like a frightened rabbit, her delicate shoulders hunched.

"Ms. Sinclair, did I scare you?" Adrian's expression softened with concern.

Arabella nodded—then quickly shook her head, her fingers nervously twisting her dress.

"It's my fault, really. If anything, I took advantage of the situation. I apologize." Adrian spoke bluntly, his police training making him direct to a fault.

What?

Lillian stiffened at the word "advantage," her gaze sharpening as her fists clenched.

Then, the doorbell rang again.

Suppressing her irritation, Lillian checked the monitor—and froze.

"Is my sister back?" Adrian followed.

Seeing Alexander's face on the screen, Adrian inhaled sharply.
###Chapter 508

Aaron's gaze locked onto Lily.

Lily arched an eyebrow, her lips twisting into a frown. "Did you invite Chairman Ashbourne here?" Suspicion dripped from her tone.

He widened his eyes, playing dumb. "Wow, that's harsh. Sure, I'm Emeric's son, but I'm no Benedict Arnold. My loyalty's always been to Evadne!"

A reluctant smirk tugged at Lily's lips at his audacity. "Then what's the plan? Do we let him in?"

Shoving his hands in his pockets, Aaron scoffed. "If you don't open that door, trust me, my old man will rip it clean off its hinges."

Lily had no comeback for that.

Not wanting to offend such an influential figure, she inhaled sharply and turned the knob.

The Ashbourne family's security detail swarmed the villa's courtyard, an intimidating sea of black suits.

Emeric stood at the threshold, his expression frostier than a midwinter storm, with Mr. Dunn hovering behind him.

Emeric had been ready to unleash hell—until he spotted his youngest son. His brain short-circuited.

Mr. Dunn blinked in shock. "Young Master Ashbourne?!"

Aaron rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. "Hey, Dad."

Emeric's gaze ping-ponged between his son and Lily before taking a deliberate step back to check the house number.

"Chairman Ashbourne, you're at the right place," Mr. Dunn supplied helpfully, though his lips twitched with suppressed amusement.

"Right."

Emeric nodded slowly—then his eyes lit up with sudden realization. "Ah! So this is your girlfriend? I see now. You've got a thing for the feisty ones. Should've known—would've saved me the trouble of setting you up with all those sweet girl-next-door types."

Lily's jaw dropped. Aaron groaned, dragging a hand down his face. "Dad, please stop. If you keep this up, I'm joining a monastery. You know why I became a cop in Elmsworth? To escape your nonstop marriage lectures! I'm not some prize stallion!"

Lily pressed her lips together, fighting a laugh. Even the elite weren't immune to parental nagging.

"If you dare join a monastery, I'll drag you out by your ears—mark my words!"

Emeric's scowl melted into a salesman's grin as he turned to Lily. "Miss, how old are you? What's your name? Where do you work? Are your parents local or from Skyrim?"

He leaned in conspiratorially. "My son plays it cool, but I've had his wedding gift ready for years. Marry into the Ashbournes, and you'll live like royalty. No need to overthink it—better to settle these things early!"

"Dad!" Aaron looked ready to combust with humiliation.

"Chairman Ashbourne, you're mistaken," Lily interjected smoothly. "Mr. Ashbourne and I are strictly professional. I'm Mr. Fairhaven's secretary."

Emeric's face fell. He shot Aaron a withering glare.

"Perhaps we should continue this inside?" Mr. Dunn suggested diplomatically, though his smirk betrayed him. The Ashbourne heirs were Emeric's pride—and his perpetual headache.

Father and son faced off in the living room, the air thick with awkward tension.

"Did everyone know Evadne was here except me?" Emeric ground out. "Am I even your father anymore?"

Aaron snatched an apple from the fruit bowl and crunched into it. "Maybe we should get a paternity test."

Emeric inhaled sharply, counting to ten.

Lily, usually unflappable, bit her lip to stifle a laugh.

Soft footsteps interrupted the standoff.

Mari entered with a tea tray, setting a cup before Emeric with practiced grace. "Mr. Emeric, your tea."

Emeric's stern expression softened at the sight of her delicate features. "Mari! Keeping your sister company, I see?"

"Y-Yes," she stammered, cheeks flushing. She couldn't exactly admit she was living with Jareth, so she dodged the truth.

"Never mind that!" Emeric brightened, pulling her closer for inspection. "No boyfriend, right? What do you think of my youngest here? He's a bit rough around the edges, but you two would balance each other out."

Aaron choked on his tea, spraying it across the table.

Mari recoiled, fingers twisting in her skirt, her porcelain skin turning scarlet.

Aaron might be blunt, but his detective instincts were sharp. He noted her skittishness—social anxiety, maybe?

As she nibbled her lip, eyes glistening like a startled fawn's, something protective stirred in him.

"Dad!" he barked. "Did you come here just to kidnap a bride? I've told you—I'm focusing on my career, not marriage! Drop it!"

Emeric narrowed his eyes. "You think you have a choice? If you'd had your way, you wouldn't have been born."

"F—" Aaron barely swallowed the curse, his face burning.

Why him? With four older brothers, why was he the one being hounded like some prized breeding bull?

His job had him globetrotting for high-risk missions. What woman would want that life? If he ever married, he'd want to cherish his wife—not leave her lonely.

As Emeric continued his matchmaking, Lily swiftly pulled Mari into a shielding embrace and leveled him with a glare.

"Chairman Ashbourne, while I appreciate the sentiment, she's already spoken for."

"By who?" Emeric scoffed. "Who could possibly outmatch my son?"

"Mr. Jareth Fairhaven," Lily stated coolly, though amusement danced in her eyes. "Their relationship has Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Frederic's blessing. In fact, Jareth will soon formally propose after being named Fairhaven Group's CEO."

Though Jareth had whispered promises of marriage, hearing it aloud sent a giddy thrill through Mari, her cheeks blooming pink.

Emeric blinked, recalibrating. He turned to Aaron with a nudge. "No ring yet? There's still time to sweep her off her feet."

Aaron wished the floor would swallow him whole.

Footsteps cut through the tension—sharp, purposeful.

"Emeric!" Evadne stood hands on hips, glowering. "Why the armed entourage? Planning a hostile takeover?"

Love had tempered her fear of confronting him. Even if he threw the full weight of K Group at them, it wouldn't matter.

Last night, curled against Thaddeus, she'd traced his lips and whispered, "What's on your mind?"

He'd nipped her finger playfully. "Just thinking about the battles ahead."

"Then we'll fight them together," she'd declared, resting her head on his chest. "No more cold feet, alright?"

He'd pinched her waist. "Evadne, I wasn't—"

"I know," she'd teased.

He'd surrendered with a smile. If calling him a coward kept her close, so be it.

"Nothing will part us," she'd murmured.

"Nothing," he'd vowed, lacing their fingers. "In life and beyond."

Now, seeing his daughter grocery shopping like a commoner, Emeric's eye twitched.

His precious heiress, raised with armies of servants, now carrying her own bags!

His outrage faltered when he spotted Thaddeus behind her, arms laden with groceries like a pack mule.

A pang of envy stabbed Emeric's chest.

Thaddeus, misreading his glare, hastily set the bags down and bowed. "Chairman Ashbourne, my apologies."

"He should apologize to you!" Evadne snapped. "Violence was unacceptable!"

Emeric's heart clenched. He exhaled sharply. "Evadne, you've had your rebellion. My patience wears thin. It's time to come home."
###Chapter 509

The living room temperature plummeted as if winter had arrived early.

Nathaniel knew better than to interfere. Any intervention would only escalate tensions like pouring gasoline on flames. So he slipped away unnoticed, melting into the background.

Olivia gently guided Penelope away, creating space for the crucial conversation between father and daughter.

Alexander felt his breath hitch. His fingers twitched with the instinct to reach for Isabella's hand, but he curled them into fists instead.

-Isabella. Stay with me.

Alexander was no coward; he loved fiercely and hated passionately with equal intensity.

But his failures weren't just toward Isabella - he owed Eleanor remorse too.

Whether during their painful three-year marriage or the loss of their child, every wound stemmed from his mistakes. He'd damaged Eleanor's pride and joy, making himself unforgivable.

Even if Eleanor unleashed a torrent of insults or threw another punch, Alexander would endure it until her anger subsided.

"Eleanor, what exactly are you thinking?" Isabella scoffed, her gaze unyielding. "If I could be swayed by your words, I wouldn't have risked everything to escape that prison you called home. Save your breath. I thrived alone overseas for years without your interference. Yet now you're pulling every string to sabotage my happiness?"

Alexander stepped closer, studying Isabella's resolute profile with concern.

"Isabella!"

Eleanor's face drained of color, his breathing turning ragged with fury. "Look at yourself! Is this the heiress of the Sinclair family? Grocery shopping? Cooking for yourself? Haven't you had enough playing unpaid housewife to the Kingsleys for three years? Is this the love story you envisioned?"

His rage crescendoed with each word.

His cherished daughter, meant for pampering, not suffering!

Alexander wasn't worthy!

"Eleanor, this ordinary life is everything I've ever wanted."

Isabella fought back emotions, her voice turning sharp. "You've never understood me or even what mother truly desired. You've no right to judge my choices."

Her words struck Eleanor like searing brands, blurring his vision.

"Besides, Alexander does all the cooking, cleaning, and laundry. I just keep him company shopping."

Isabella's warm hand enveloped Alexander's clenched fist, their fingers intertwining firmly. "My Alexander can do everything except give birth. Now stop your unnecessary worrying."

"Tonight, you can either stay for dinner or leave. Your choice."

While Nathaniel had excused himself from the confrontation, he hadn't left entirely. Wandering down a hallway, he noticed elegant copper-framed paintings - early summer scenes, playful puppies, and numerous portraits.

He paused before a life-sized portrait.

The man depicted wore black, his tall frame broad-shouldered with a narrow waist, eyes gleaming like gemstones - that was Julian.

Nathaniel's eyes widened in admiration, his manners preventing him from touching the artwork.

"Remarkable. The likeness is stunning."

"Really?"

Startled, Nathaniel turned.

Penelope stood behind him, eyes downcast shyly, clutching a teddy bear to her chest.

Her adorable expression was irresistible.

Nathaniel's gaze softened, a warm smile forming. "Absolutely. Did you paint this?"

She nodded slightly.

"You've poured considerable thought and effort into it."

"It's nothing. Julian likes it, that's what matters."

At Julian's mention, Penelope's eyes sparkled, cheeks flushing. "Julian's so kind to me. This painting is all I can offer. His appreciation makes me happy."

Nathaniel felt an unexpected stirring in his chest.

Years immersed in law enforcement's darkness rarely exposed him to such pure innocence.

This young woman, like moonlight, unknowingly illuminated his shadowed heart.

"Officer Nathaniel?" Penelope blinked at his intense stare.

He snapped back, lips curving. "At Isabella's birthday, you called her 'sister-in-law.' No formalities needed. Just call me Nathaniel."

"Nathaniel?" She repeated obediently.

His gaze intent, Nathaniel began speaking when a cold voice interrupted.

"Mr. Sinclair, Ms. Penelope is our young master's companion. Isn't this proximity rather inappropriate?"

Margaret approached protectively, her dark eyes flashing loyalty to Julian.

Nathaniel remained unruffled, smiling lightly. "I fail to see any impropriety warranting such hostility. Is conversing with a man now forbidden? Is he that insecure?"

"You!"

Margaret's face reddened with fury at the implication.

Were Nathaniel not Isabella's brother, she'd have unleashed her temper.

"Margaret, wait." Penelope tugged her sleeve.

Though often tongue-tied, Penelope understood social nuances.

Officer Nathaniel only engaged her because of his sister-in-law. Causing discord would embarrass Isabella.

Nathaniel's gaze swept Penelope's anxious face. Smirking, he breezed past Margaret. "If she's truly his, no guarding is needed. We Sinclairs are all well-bred."

To everyone's astonishment -

After their heated argument, Eleanor chose to stay for dinner.

One moment red-faced with rage, the next seated at their table - only a Sinclair could execute such whiplash-inducing emotional shifts.

Poor Alexander was terrified.

Cooking for his potential father-in-law felt more daunting than appearing before royalty. His heart lodged in his throat!

Eleanor sat regally in the living room, his presence weighing on Alexander like an imperial audience.

"Isabella, I only know a few simple dishes poorly prepared." Alexander stood stiffly in the kitchen. "What if your father can't stomach my cooking?"

Isabella laughed, draping an apron around his neck. "Oh come on, it's not that bad. Though I'll warn you - Dad's palate has been spoiled by Arabella's cooking for years. He's quite the gourmet."

Alexander swallowed hard.

"Don't worry, I'll guide you step-by-step. Just follow my lead."

His eyes brimming with warmth, Alexander embraced his petite commander, kissing her forehead.

"At your service, Commander."

"Wait! Meat goes in first - wrong order!"

"Too much vinegar!"

"The pan's burning - flip it now!"

Their kitchen became a battlefield of chaos.

Eleanor, initially resting with closed eyes, opened them at the commotion, gazing toward the open-concept kitchen.

He saw Alexander bustling about while Isabella directed playfully - bumping him with her hip or flicking his head.

Far from irritation, the young man grinned like a lovestruck fool.

Exactly what Isabella adored about him.

Though Eleanor's expression remained stormy, his gaze softened watching the couple, unable to look away.

A phrase surfaced: "the warmth of ordinary life."

This relaxed atmosphere, this simple joy - wasn't this what he'd always sought?

"Chairman Sinclair, see how happy Miss Isabella is. It's been ages since you've seen her smile like this, hasn't it?" Richard observed affectionately.

"Hmph! After a lifetime of wisdom, how did I raise such a hopeless romantic! She'll regret this!" Eleanor grumbled.

Richard persisted, "Then let her be romantic. Our Miss has beauty and brains with limitless wealth. If she wants love, why not indulge her? Who'd dare offend the Sinclairs? And Mr. Alexander - given time, you'll see his qualities: handsome, good family, strong work ethic. Most importantly, his integrity and kindness set him apart."

Eleanor frowned skeptically. "Since when did you become his advocate? Did he adopt you as godfather?"

Richard shook his head. "I merely speak truth as I see it."

Eleanor turned away brooding.

"Chairman, you stayed tonight because you miss your daughter, don't you?"

Richard noted the loneliness in Eleanor's eyes. "Miss Isabella's been elusive, weighing on you. This rare chance to see her - you couldn't bear leaving hastily."

Thus the formidable man swallowed his pride to stay.

"Sir, you're hard as diamond, but if only you'd express love more directly, what problem couldn't be solved?"

Eleanor pursed his lips silently.

After a moment, he asked suddenly, "Richard, am I truly so terrible? Arranging Isabella with the Montgomery's son - she's too young to understand marriage. Compatibility outweighs fleeting affection. Adrian could make her happier than Alexander. She doesn't realize now, but marriage is long-term. When passion fades and reality emerges, will she cope? Have no regrets?"

"I just wanted her to consider options. What's wrong with that?"

Richard pondered before responding thoughtfully. "Parental love runs deep, and your intentions are sound. But I disagree on one point - you prioritize compatibility over affection, whereas I believe character outweighs both."

"I don't know Mr. Adrian well, but his informing you of Isabella and Alexander's whereabouts speaks volumes. If he truly fancied Miss Isabella, he should compete fairly. Using your influence against Mr. Alexander seems rather underhanded."

Richard's pointed critique left Eleanor deep in thought.
###Chapter 510

The kitchen had been a battlefield for the past hour, but finally, a few presentable dishes made it to the dining table.

Thaddeus could handle basic stir-fries, but anything more elaborate was clearly beyond his skill set.

This modest success was only possible under Evadne's strict supervision. Left to his own devices, dinner might not have been served until midnight.

Sweat dripped from Thaddeus's brow, his white shirt clinging to his back as if he'd just wrestled with the stove.

Seeing him like this, Evadne felt a surge of affection. She grabbed a napkin and dabbed his forehead, pouting. "Emeric is such a nuisance! With an army of chefs at home and Myra, the culinary genius, why does he insist on making our lives difficult?"

Thaddeus chuckled, unfazed. "Evadne, you said yourself you wanted him to stay for dinner and try my cooking. It's been a while since you saw him."

Guilt flickered across her face, her cheeks flushing. "I was being sarcastic! Can't he take a hint?"

"Don't worry about it," Thaddeus murmured, wrapping an arm around her waist. "I've always wanted to do something for Emeric, even if it's just a simple meal."

"Trying to win him over?" Evadne pressed closer, their noses almost touching. "Give it up, sweetheart. He's impossible. You could serve him a feast, and he'd still give you the cold shoulder. Besides, you don’t need his approval. We’re together—that’s all that matters."

A deliberate cough interrupted them.

Evadne rolled her eyes. Emeric was a master at killing the mood.

"Well, well," Emeric drawled, seating himself with exaggerated grace. "I thought you were making me breakfast, Mr. Thaddeus."

Thaddeus remained silent.

Evadne narrowed her eyes. "No one forced you to stay for dinner. Just so you know, this is the first time Thaddeus has cooked for anyone besides me. Be grateful and don’t complain."

This time, it was Emeric who stayed quiet.

Thaddeus smiled. Father and daughter were more alike than they’d admit—same stubbornness, same sharp tongues.

Emeric ate with rigid posture, his back straight as a board. Thaddeus watched nervously, feeling like an ugly duckling awaiting judgment.

"Did you drown this in soy sauce?"

"Did you personally execute the salt merchant?"

"These vegetables are mush. A culinary tragedy."

Emeric didn’t hold back, critiquing between bites.

Thaddeus had expected criticism, but not a full-on roast. He could only offer a strained smile. Still, having Emeric at their table was more than he’d ever dared hope for.

Evadne snapped. "Enough, Emeric! If you don’t like it, leave! Thaddeus worked hard on this meal. If you can’t appreciate it, at least don’t insult him. And if it’s so terrible, why are you eating so much? Trying to punish yourself?"

"I flew here nonstop to see you and haven’t even had water!" Emeric shot back, shoveling food into his mouth. "I’m starving! Do you think I enjoy this? It’s barely edible!"

Evadne, initially furious, burst out laughing at his dramatics.

Emeric, seeing her smile, couldn’t suppress one of his own.

The tension dissolved, replaced by something resembling a normal family dinner.

Father and daughter silently agreed to avoid topics that might ruin the mood.

"Hey! You guys having a feast without me?" Aaron barged in, stomach growling, and plopped down at the table. "Evadne, not cool. I eat a lot, but I can’t out-eat Thaddeus. Worried I’ll clean you out?"

Emeric and Evadne turned to him in unison. "We forgot about you."

After dinner, Emeric prepared to leave.

Evadne stood on the steps, watching as he and Dn headed to the car. Thaddeus, ever respectful, escorted them.

Before getting in, Emeric turned, piercing Thaddeus with a glare. "Don’t get cocky. I stayed tonight for Evadne, not you. I haven’t forgiven you, and I never will."

Thaddeus stood tall, voice rough with emotion. "I know I’m far from perfect. I don’t expect forgiveness. All I ask is the chance to make Evadne happy. For her, I’d risk everything."

Emeric’s eyes narrowed. "Save the act, Thaddeus. I have a heart of stone for everyone but family. Even if you died for her, I’d still despise you. When this ends, you’ll regret it."

"The only regret I have," Thaddeus said, voice trembling, "is not realizing sooner how much Evadne means to me. Even if it ends badly, I’ll protect her until my last breath."

Emeric stared at him for a long moment before getting into the car.

Only when the Ashbourne vehicles had vanished did Thaddeus return to Evadne’s side.

"What did he say?" she asked, looping her arm through his.

"He said you should sleep early, eat on time, and stop overworking yourself," Thaddeus murmured, kissing her cheek. "And no ice cream during your period."

Evadne squinted at him. "The first part sounds like him. The last bit is all you, isn’t it?"

"Guilty," he admitted with a wry smile. "But will you listen, just this once?"

"Fine, fine. But really, what did he say? I bet it wasn’t nice!"

Thaddeus chuckled. "Does it matter? You’re still here with me. That’s enough."

On the drive back, Dn stayed silent. The atmosphere was tense, but not because of Thaddeus.

After a while, Emeric muttered, "The kid’s cooking wasn’t half bad."

Dn blinked. "Thanks to the young lady’s guidance."

"He’s patient," Emeric grumbled. "I couldn’t stand a woman nagging me like that. Annoying as hell."

"Madam used to do the same," Dn said without thinking, then froze.

Emeric’s expression darkened, his throat tightening. "Dn. I miss Silvana."

Dn didn’t know how to respond.

"When Evadne said I never knew what her mother wanted… it broke me." Emeric closed his eyes, shadows flickering across his face. "In this world, who else understands her?"

"The young miss is still young," Dn said gently. "One day, she’ll understand."

After Emeric left, Lily took Mari upstairs while Evadne and Aaron discussed business.

"I swear I’m not the snitch!" Aaron raised three fingers.

"I know," Evadne said firmly. "Even Bet wouldn’t use Emeric against us."

"If he had an issue, he’d have come sooner. Someone’s trying to sabotage you two!"

"Probably Snakey Avery," Evadne said without hesitation. "His spies are everywhere. One must’ve seen us and reported back."

Aaron shook his head. "Despicable."

"Doesn’t matter." Evadne turned to Thaddeus, her gaze soft. "Their schemes won’t touch us."

Thaddeus kissed her, oblivious to anyone else.

Aaron groaned. "Get a room! This is worse than a heavy meal!"

Back to business, Thaddeus opened the file Aaron had brought.

"The Elspeth trial is coming up. Here’s everything we’ve compiled. This is our only shot—we can’t let her or the Abernathy group breathe."

Thaddeus nodded, resolve hardening.

"Thank you," Evadne said, squeezing his hand. "But this is as far as you and my brother go. It’s already risky bringing this to us. We’ll handle the rest."

Aaron nodded. "Good luck."

"We don’t need luck," Thaddeus said quietly. "We have each other."

As Aaron headed for the door, it swung open—revealing Jareth, dust-covered from travel.

Jareth’s eyes widened. "What are you doing here?"

Aaron smirked. "Excuse me."

Jareth’s temper flared. "Well, well. The TV star."

"And you are?" Aaron tilted his head. "The overprotective Bro Jareth?"
